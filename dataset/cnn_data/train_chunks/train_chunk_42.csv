"(CNN) -- It's just one thing after another for Richard and Mayumi Heene. They've caused such an uproar after last week's alleged balloon boy hoax that Lifetime won't air a re-run of their ""Wife Swap"" episode. The Heene family's ""Wife Swap"" episode has been pulled from Lifetime's programming schedule. Those who pay close attention to TV Guide would have noticed that the Heene family's first episode for the ABC reality show was scheduled to air on Lifetime on Thursday, October 29, at 2 p.m. ET. ""It was on the schedule long before the incident,"" a Lifetime spokesperson said. The incident refers to the giant, homemade balloon that sailed over Colorado on Thursday, purportedly carrying 6-year-old Falcon Heene. The bubble burst when authorities discovered Falcon had been hiding in a box in the attic. During an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer, the Heene's asked Falcon why he didn't come out as they searched for him, and the boy replied, ""You guys said we did it for a show."" That triggered an investigation that revealed the frightful incident was a hoax, police said. Richard and Mayumi Heene are now facing a number of local charges, and the Federal Aviation Administration has begun its own balloon boy investigation, officials said. As a result, Lifetime has decided to erase the family's ""Wife Swap"" past from the network. ""Once we found out"" [it was allegedly a hoax], the spokesperson said, ""we decided to pull it off the air. At this time, we don't have any plans to air it in the near future."" The episode depicted Karen Martel, whose husband runs a child-proofing business, as being shocked ""as the Heene kids jump off banisters and run wild, and appalled by Richard's attitude to women,"" according to the description on ABC's Web site. ""Wife Swap"" asks its participants to switch places for two weeks. ""Meanwhile, at the Martels',"" the description continued, ""Mayumi Heene sees safety gates everywhere and wonders how the family [has] fun. She asks the kids about their anxieties and confronts Jay about the climate of fear in his house."" Lifetime plans on filling the time slot with a ""Wife Swap"" episode that features another family, but rest assured, the Heene's reality TV debut can still be found on YouTube.","Lifetime had scheduled a Heene ""Wife Swap"" episode for October 29 .

"New York (CNN) -- A leading Muslim-American group lashed out at the federal government Friday for moving to seize assets -- including four mosques -- that belong to a foundation and a corporation believed linked to Iran. ""The American Muslim and faith communities must not allow houses of worship to become pawns in geopolitical struggles,"" said Imam Mahdi Bray, executive director of the Muslim American Society's Freedom Foundation. ""The tension between the United States and Iran must not be played out in the mosques of America."" Federal prosecutors say their actions against assets belonging to the Alavi Foundation and the Assa Corp., which also include a Manhattan skyscraper, are not an effort to target mosques. ""There are no allegations of any wrongdoing on the part of any of these tenants or occupants,"" said Yusill Scribner, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York in a written statement Thursday. ""The tenants and occupants remain free to use the properties as they have before today's filing."" A senior Justice Department official told reporters that the government is moving against the Iranian landlords of the buildings, not seizing mosques as religious-oriented facilities. The mosques -- in New York, Maryland, California and Texas -- just happen to be among the tenants of the buildings in question, the official said. But the Muslim American Society's Freedom Foundation called the actions an ""unprecedented encroachment of religious freedom."" The group said ""it is an abiding concern among the American Muslim community that this action is just the beginning of a backlash after last week's Fort Hood shooting tragedy."" A Muslim-American soldier is accused in a Fort Hood, Texas, shooting spree that left 13 people dead and dozens injured. The Council on American-Islamic Relations, another leading Muslim-American group, issued a statement Thursday saying the government's actions may have First Amendment implications. ""Whatever the details of the government's case against the owners of the mosques, as a civil rights organization we are concerned that the seizure of American houses of worship could have a chilling effect on the religious freedom of citizens of all faiths and may send a negative message to Muslims worldwide,"" said Ibrahim Hooper, the national communications director for the council. The controversy erupted after prosecutors in New York filed an amended civil complaint seeking forfeiture of all assets of the Alavi Foundation and Assa Corp. They include properties owned by the foundation in several states. A 36-story office tower in midtown Manhattan is owned by the 650 Fifth Avenue Company, a partnership between Alavi and Assa, the Justice Department said. The complaint alleges that the Alavi Foundation provided services to the Iranian government and transferred money from 650 Fifth Avenue Company to Bank Melli, Iran's largest state-owned financial entity. U.S. and European Union officials last year designated Bank Melli as a proliferator for supporting Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs and funneling money to the Revolutionary Guard and Quds Force, considered terrorist groups by the United States. Bank Melli issued a statement last year denying involvement in deceptive banking practices. Prosecutors allege the properties at issue were ""involved in and [were] the proceeds of money laundering offenses,"" and that the owners violated the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, executive orders and U.S. Department of Treasury regulations. ""As today's complaint alleges in great detail, the Alavi Foundation has effectively been a front for the government of Iran,"" Preet Bharara, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said on Thursday. ""For two decades, the Alavi Foundation's affairs have been directed by various Iranian officials, including Iranian ambassadors to the United Nations, in violation of a series of American laws. The Alavi Foundation's former president remains under investigation for alleged obstruction of justice, and both the criminal and civil investigations are ongoing."" John Winter, a New York lawyer representing the Alavi Foundation, said his client would challenge the complaint. ""We're obviously disappointed that the government brought this action because we have been cooperating with the government since this investigation began about a year ago and we intend to litigate this matter,"" he said. ""It may take some time, but at the end of this litigation, we're of the mind that we're going to prevail here."" The buildings remained open and were continuing to operate as usual. When a CNN reporter arrived at one of the seized mosques -- in Queens, a New York City borough -- he found it to be operating normally. There was a copy of the federal complaint taped to the front door of the building, but the doors were open and people were coming and going. Calls to the Iranian Mission for comment were not immediately returned. A report Friday on the Web site of Iran's state-run Press TV did not contain any responses from Iranian officials. CNN's Terry Frieden, Brian Todd, Deb Feyerick, Eddie DeMarche and Ross Levitt contributed to this story.","Group says houses of worship should not be ""pawns in geopolitical struggles""

"ISLAMABAD, Paksitan (CNN) -- At least 41 people were killed and dozens wounded in a blast Monday at a security forces checkpoint in northwest Pakistan, authorities said. A girl places flowers at a shrine to army soldiers killed by militants who stormed Pakistan's army HQ. About 45 people were injured in the explosion in the Shangla district in the volatile Swat Valley, said Syed Altaf Hussein, a senior government official in the area. The explosion targeted a military vehicle, officials said. The blast is the latest in a string of attacks in the country. On Saturday, militants attacked the army headquarters in Rawalpindi, killing 11 military personnel and three civilians, according to the Pakistani military's press office. Nine militants died in the attack. A total of 39 hostages were freed Sunday morning after being held by five militants at the army headquarters. In a news conference Monday, the top spokesman for the Pakistani military said Saturday's attack was planned by the Taliban based in South Waziristan. Gen. Athar Abbas said intelligence agents intercepted a phone call in which Pakistani Taliban commander Wali-ur Rehman was informed about the start of the attack. Rehman responded by calling for a prayer for the operation to succeed, Abbas said. Abbas said the leader of the operation, who was captured alive, is from Pakistan's Punjab province. Four other militants were from Punjab as well. Five others were from South Waziristan. During the standoff, two of the militants held 22 hostages in a small room, Abbas said. One of the militants wore a suicide vest connected to a mine and a bomb. He sat in the middle of the 22 hostages. Abbas said this room was the focus of the operation and security forces were successful in storming the room and killing the militant with the suicide vest before he could detonate his bombs. Military officials said they have tightened security around army headquarters. The attacks will not deter Pakistan from launching an offensive in South Waziristan, the Interior Ministry said. South Waziristan is one of seven districts in Pakistan's tribal region along the Afghan border. Intelligence analysts consider it a haven for Islamic militants who have launched attacks in Pakistan and targeted U.S. forces in neighboring Afghanistan. A date for the offensive in the area has not been announced. The Shangla district east of Mingora is one of the areas where the military conducted search-and-destroy operations earlier this year. Troops targeted terrorist hideouts and reported the arrest of one militant leader and the death of another. Mingora is the largest city in the Swat Valley, where the Pakistani military is battling Taliban militants for control. CNN's Reza Sayah contributed to this report.","41 killed in blast at security checkpoint in northwestern Pakistan .

"(CNN)  -- Murder and rape charges will be filed against a North Carolina man in the death of 5-year-old Shaniya Davis, police said Thursday. Mario Andrette McNeill had already been charged with kidnapping the Fayetteville, North Carolina, girl. She was reported missing last week, and her body was found Monday beside a road near Sanford, about 30 miles northwest of Fayetteville. Preliminary autopsy results indicate the child was asphyxiated, Fayetteville Police Chief Tom Bergamine told reporters Thursday, but testing is still being completed and a final report has not been issued. McNeill will be charged with first-degree murder and rape of a child, Bergamine said. The new arrest warrants were being served Thursday night. The girl's mother, Antoinette Nicole Davis, has been charged with human trafficking and other offenses. Police have said they believe Davis was prostituting the child. According to police, surveillance video taken November 10 from a hotel in Sanford, North Carolina, shows Shaniya in the company of McNeill. Authorities had said Wednesday they would need to determine where Shaniya was killed before filing additional charges. Fayetteville is in Cumberland County, while Sanford is in Lee County. Bergamine said Thursday jurisdiction in the case would remain in Cumberland County. ""We started it from the beginning and wanted to finish it out,"" he said. Police still are not sure exactly where Shaniya was killed, Bergamine said. Police earlier had said they believe the child was alive when she left the hotel. ""Current charges on Ms. Davis are standing as they are right now,"" Bergamine said. But he told reporters the investigation was ongoing. He and other officers spoke about the emotional toll the investigation has taken on them. Grief counseling has been under way for officers at the department, he said. ""It's been a tough case,"" said Fayetteville Police Capt. Charles Kimball, the toughest in his 14 years, he said. ""Our mission was to find Shaniya and we did it."" ""This case here has reached out and touched all of us,"" Bergamine said. Shaniya's father, Bradley Lockhart, made a tearful appeal before reporters Tuesday afternoon, asking that ""everybody makes it a point not to ignore, to look past a situation where a person, a child, or anybody might be in danger ... so that we don't have another tragedy like Shaniya."" The girl went to her mother's last month, he said. CNN's Gabriel Falcon contributed to this report.","Mario Andrette McNeill will be charged with murder, rape, police say .

"(CNN) -- At least 51 people have died and at least 21 others are missing after torrential rains and subsequent flooding pummeled the Philippines on Saturday, the government said. Filipino pedestrians in Quezon City, a suburb of Manila, brave Tropical Storm Ketsana's floodwaters. Tropical Storm Ketsana spawned the flooding, which caused at least six of the deaths in Manila, the nation's capital. Manila and the nearby province of Rizal bore the brunt of the downpour, said Gilberto Teodoro, secretary of national defense and chairman of the National Disaster Coordinating Council. Two of the dead in the capital city were victims of a wall that collapsed, he said. Five thousand people were rescued without boats, and another 3,688 were rescued with boats, he said. Another governmental official reported four injuries. ""My neighborhood rarely gets a bad flooding and I guess this is the worst,"" said CNN iReporter Jv Abellar from Quezon City, Philippines. ""Traversing through the flood is like walking through rapids."" In all, 41,205 people had sought refuge in 92 evacuation centers, Teodoro said. By 8:30 a.m. Sunday (8:30 p.m. Saturday ET), the torrential rains ended and slight rainfall was reported. Some roads in the capital metropolitan area had reopened, but ""we do not encourage people to travel these roads,"" Teodoro told CNN in a telephone interview. ""They can be a hindrance to efficient relief and rescue operations."" The federal government began massive relief efforts to aid the local governments, and set up aid centers addressing pressing problems such as sanitation and water purification. President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo has ordered pay parking lots at malls in Manila to be opened so motorists can leave their cars there without charge, Teodoro said. iReport.com: Share images of Philippines flooding . Manila's Nino Aquino International Airport and nearly all of the country's other international airports had reopened, he said. Though the Philippines is no stranger to floods, Saturday's downpours approached a record, with 341 mm (13.4 inches) falling between 8 a.m. and 2 p.m., he said. The average rainfall for the entire month of September is 391 mm (15.4 inches), he said.","NEW: .

"(CNN) -- Bad weather, poor planning, a lack of safety equipment. Any one could put a boater in the kind of peril that befell two NFL players and their two friends off the coast of Florida last weekend, Coast Guard officials say. Ex-college football player  Nick Schuyler clings to an overturned boat Monday in this Coast Guard photo. And such incidents happen all too often. The capsizing of the 21-foot fishing boat carrying the four men to a favorite fishing spot in the Gulf of Mexico was the latest of 200 such incidents reported to the U.S. Coast Guard in the past five months. ""The oceans are an unforgiving environment,"" said Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Chris O'Neil. ""Weather can be unpredictable. Any time you are in an open environment, you are taking a certain amount of risk."" That risk includes being lost at sea like Victor ""Marquis"" Cooper, an Oakland Raiders linebacker; Corey Smith, a Detroit Lions free-agent defensive end; and their friend William Bleakly. The fourth member of the group, Nick Schuyler, a former  University of South Florida football player, was found around noon Monday clinging to the upturned boat in rough seas about 35 miles west of Clearwater, Florida. The four men had left for a fishing trip from Seminole Boat Ramp in Clearwater Pass on Saturday. The U.S. Coast Guard is unable to provide specific numbers of how many people go missing from boating accidents like this past weekend's, but officials say that since last fall there have been three people who have not been found after triggering Coast Guard searches. Those incidents can range from an unaccounted swimmer to a passenger gone missing after a boat sinks, said O'Neil, at the Coast Guard headquarters in Washington D.C. Capsizing is one of the leading boating accidents, according to the Coast Guard's most recent report on recreational boating in 2007. Officials report there were 398 accidents from capsizing, causing 204 deaths and 284 injuries in 2007. Capsized boats cost nearly $1.8 million a year in property damages, officials say. Collision with vessels or fixed objects and falling overboard are other major boating accidents. Last weekend, Florida state officials recovered the bodies of a 48-year-old man and his 7-year-old granddaughter after their 15-foot bass tipped over in Lake Okeechobee, according to CNN affiliate WPTV-TV in West Palm Beach, Florida. ""The steering cable broke and the boat went out of control,"" family member Isabelo Santiago Jr. told WPTV. To remain safe on any body of water, Coast Guard officials stress having the proper safety equipment and being wary of changes in the weather. The NFL players' boat capsized off Florida in waves up to 10 feet high while being buffeted by winds up to 45 miles per hour, Coast Guard officials said. They reported 110 cases since this fall where a boat has been beset by weather. Boaters should wear a life jacket at all times, officials say, because an accident can occur so quickly that passengers may not have time to put their life jackets on. A life jacket that is bright or has deflecting tape to help catch the eyes of rescuers is recommended. Boaters should also keep a bag with flotation and communication devices, officials said. The Coast Guard encourages boaters to purchase Emergency Position Indicating Radiobeacons (EPIRBs) that can cost between $200 to $1,500. This technology enables emergency signals to be sent out automatically or manually when a boat sinks. Some EPIRBs have global positioning devices that can help provide the rescuers with a more exact location. After a boat capsizes, passengers should always stay near the vessel to make it easier for rescuers to find them, especially in waves and high winds. Whitecaps on waves can also confuse Coast Guard searches. Schuyler, who was rescued on Monday, was easier to find because he was near the boat, Coast Guard officials say. Wayne Cathel says he and six of his friends were in a similar situation in 1993 when their boat capsized during a spear fishing trip in John's Pass in South Florida, according to CNN affiliate Bay News 9 in St. Petersburg. The group was stranded for 18 hours before being rescued by a helicopter. ""We all had to cling on to the hull of the boat for the whole time until we were finally rescued,"" Cathel said. ""You never leave the largest object in the water,"" he said. ""I mean that's what you stick with."" Sticking with the overturned vessel also helps the Coast Guard use advanced computer technology to find it, officials said. Called SAROPS, or Search and Rescue Optimal Planning Systems, the program takes into account external conditions such as weather, ocean patterns and information available about the case such as which dock the boaters departed from to map locations in the ocean where officers can search. The program, which has been used by the Coast Guard's Seventh District for nearly two years, helps officers narrow down the location, especially critical during the beginning of a search, said Petty Officer Jennifer Johnson of the Seventh District. For the program to work best, Coast Guard officials say, boaters need to be sure to tell people where are they leaving from and their final destination. Even with the technology, a sea rescue is no easy feat, Johnson said.""It's very difficult to locate someone....  It's like trying to find a basketball in the ocean.""","Officials report capsized boats caused 204 deaths and 284 injuries in 2007 .

"(Wired) -- The early hours of ""Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2"" take gamers around the world and back again, but the new game's story hits close to home. Military scenarios, violent police actions and straight-from-the-big-screen massive firefights take place in such far-flung locales as Afghanistan, Kazakhstan and Brazil. But things don't really get interesting until the action moves to Russia and the player is embedded in a squad of terrorists. And then, inevitably, the fight comes to U.S. shores.

(Spoiler alert: The moments I'm about to relate describe the plot of ""Modern Warfare 2"" -- not where the game finally goes, but the early incidents that establish the conflict and tension of the game. Some readers may consider these to be spoilers.) Russia is where the already-controversial ""No Russian"" scene goes down. As Army Ranger Pvt. Allen, players go undercover with Vladimir Makarov -- an underling of the villain from ""Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare."" Along with Makarov and other terrorists, the player finds themselves in the midst of a terrible situation. The fully armed Makarov and crew waltz into a Russian airport and open fire on civilians standing in a security line. As Allen, the player can take part in the bloodshed or simply walk alongside the cold-blooded killers as they execute hundreds of innocents. Either way, the scene is powerful. It's also the oldest trick in the book: The quickest way to turn audiences against your villain is to show them doing dirty deeds, and Makarov's murderous spree is a doozy. Allen doesn't walk away from the bloodbath. Once outside the terminal, players must fend off waves of incoming SWAT teams. If there's any kind of karmic debt that Allen owes for his role in the slayings, the guy pays it: At the end of the tarmac firefight, Makarov puts a bullet in Allen.

"(CNN) -- They say that breaking up is hard to do, especially when millions of eyes are there to witness every caustic comment and verbal volley. Kate and Jon Gosselin are going through a very public and contentious divorce. No one knows that better than Jon and Kate Gosselin, whose divorce is playing out on a world stage, complete with tabloid covers, he-said-she-said television appearances and court orders. Such public spats can do a great deal of harm, said divorce attorney Randall M. Kessler, who's handled several celebrity cases. ""I just gave a presentation where I said, 'When can press hurt you? It's when clients start talking,'"" Kessler said. ""The hard thing for [famous people] to do is to not speak out, because they are so used to everything they say being quoted and helping them, but this is the opposite. Talking about a divorce is never good."" The Gosselins join a growing list of celebrities whose marital woes have been well-documented by the media and paparazzi.  See a gallery of celebrity custody battles » . Kessler has represented quite a few clients involved in celebrity divorce cases, including Tameka Foster Raymond (who is in the midst of a divorce with superstar singer Usher) and rapper Mack 10 (ex-husband of TLC member Tionne ""T-Boz"" Watkins), as well as some high-profile paternity and child support lawsuits. Celebrities often want to protect their reputations and the wrong sound bite can ruin that, Kessler said. Yet, at the same time, it can be difficult for the famous to take direction, he said. ""They are so used to being in charge of their own destiny and being able to decide what's best for them that it's very hard for them to listen to attorneys, accountants or anyone that is trying to advise them,"" Kessler said. Viewers have questioned who, if anyone, Jon and Kate Gosselin are taking cues from in their very public marital battle. In May, Kate defended her husband against rumors that he had been cheating on her and stepping out while she stayed home with their twins and sextuplets. Weeks later they used their enormously popular TLC reality show, ""Jon & Kate Plus 8"", to admit what fans had begun to suspect: Their marriage was on the rocks. Soon they announced that they were divorcing, but would continue filming -- albeit separately -- their series, which for four seasons had chronicled the highs and lows of their family life. It all appeared to be relatively civil until Jon began stepping out with his new girlfriend, moved to a bachelor pad in New York and appeared to be living the high life with shopping sprees and designer duds. Jon took to the airwaves to reveal that he ""despised Kate."" Kate lamented that she missed ""the Jon I knew."" TLC announced in October that the reality show would continue as ""Kate Plus 8"" and Jon immediately called a halt to filming, claiming the series was doing damage to their children. Within days, Kate accused Jon of making off with more than $200,000 from their joint bank account. A judge ordered him to return $180,000 to the account.  Watch a discussion about the Gosselin's money madness » . Through it all, both have maintained they each have the best interests of their children at heart. Child psychologist Joanne Pedro-Carroll said the Gosselins are in a precarious position. ""It's very concerning, especially given how public this is and the children's young ages, which makes them especially vulnerable,"" Pedro-Carroll said. ""One of the things we know with really young children is that they are prone to misconceptions about the reasons for the breakup."" While Jon and Kate haven't so far added a bitter custody dispute to their matrimonial melee, Pedro-Carroll said she worries about the long-term effect on the young Gosselins. ""Sadly, the things that are happening now, with all of this conflict and having it be so public, puts these children very much at risk for having problems,"" said Pedro-Carroll, author of the forthcoming book ""Putting Children First: Proven Parenting Strategies for Helping Children Thrive After Divorce."" ""I worry about the children being pulled into loyalty conflicts, thinking about who the good person here is and who's the bad person, when children very much need two loving, responsible parents in their lives."" Kessler said he advises his celebrity clients to, when possible, keep the children out of the media and receive training in cooperative parenting. Lisa Pecot-Hebert, an assistant professor at the College of Communication at DePaul University, said she believes many viewers can relate to the Gosselins' divorce drama. Fans can also view the family's situation as a cautionary tale, she said. ""I think viewers can learn that sometimes when people let cameras into their personal lives for our entertainment, oftentimes it ruins what was theirs to begin with,"" Pecot-Hebert said.","Jon and Kate Gosselin's divorce is playing out before the public .

"(CNN) -- Seth Meyers will remain the lone talking head on the ""Saturday Night Live"" Weekend Update desk, at least in the near future, according to the comedian. Seth Meyers is thankful that politicians ""did not stop being crazy"" after the 2008 elections. ""It looks like for right now, we're going to stick with doing it solo,"" Meyers said Monday in New York as he was getting ready for the show's 35th season premiere on September 26. Meyers, SNL's head writer, hosted the popular sketch alone after Amy Poehler left the show last season. Last week, several online sites were reporting that featured player Kristen Wiig was set to become Meyers' partner on the show's longest-running recurring segment. ""I'm so heartbroken that the Internet, for the first time, was wrong about something,"" Meyers joked. ""How are we ever going to trust the Internet again?""

"(CNN) -- Varsha Vinod's exceptional abilities are hard to spot at first. She's an adorably cute 5-year-old girl from southern India, small, pretty with big brown eyes. To gain her black belt, Varsha had to learn up to 15 karate moves. When we meet for our interview, her hair is tied up in two pigtails, with bright hair clips and a glittering headband. She is as shy as most kids her age would be when confronted by a strange man and a television crew. Some child stars can be precocious but Varsha doesn't act like one. In fact, it would have been impossible to imagine her as a karate black belt if it wasn't for her white martial arts outfit and her actual black belt. Like many young girls she would love to be a dancer and she smiles when I tell her that we are doing the interview in a dance studio. It's got varnished wooden floors and ceiling-high mirrors. The venue was chosen because it looks a bit like a dojo, or martial arts school. I'm not sure Varsha understands what a dance studio is and it's hard to discover her thoughts on many things. She only speaks a few words of English and, even when we use an interpreter, she has to be prompted by her father before whispering short, quiet responses to my questions. At first I was concerned her dad was feeding her the answers rather than helping her say what she really thinks. However, it soon becomes clear that this is a healthy father-daughter relationship instead of a case of ""pushy parents."" Vishwas Vinod can be stern with his daughter but she clearly worships him, hanging on his every word and happy to follow his instructions. When the pair practice karate together their movements are surprisingly well synchronized despite the huge difference in size. Varsha's father is her inspiration. He was India's karate champion for four successive years from 1999 to 2002. His daughter started watching him teach the sport and, at the age of 2, she asked to try. Vinod insists it was Varsha's idea not his. Initially, he only gave her some small training and stretching exercises but Dad soon realized that his daughter possessed what he describes as a God-given talent. Vinod says what Varsha has done in 3½ years takes most people eight years to learn. To gain her black belt, Varsha had to learn up to 15 katas. A kata is a sequence of complicated karate moves. Varsha can punch, kick and wield different weapons: the Chinese stick, which is almost as big as she is, and a nunchaku, two short sticks connected by a metal chain. There is no doubt that Varsha's abilities are impressive. You only have to enter the phrase ""nunchaku accidents"" into YouTube to see how easily things can go wrong. However, she is no freak of nature. Her karate is a feat of memory and technique more than agility and power. To be frank, she couldn't beat me up -- although I was obviously far too proud to find out by taking her on in a sparring session.

"(CNN) -- A multiagency search is under way for the killers of two U.S. citizens in northern Mexico, according to Chihuahua state officials. A girl stands at the coffin of Mormon church leader Benjamin LeBaron in Chihuahua State. Benjamin LeBaron, 32, and his brother-in-law, Luis Widmar, in his mid-30s, were beaten and shot to death after armed men stormed into their home in Galeana on Tuesday morning. The killers have yet to be identified, but the case seems to be connected to local drug lords, said Arturo Sandoval, a spokesman for the Chihuahua state attorney general's office. Sandoval said a note was found on LeBaron's body, but he could not confirm the contents. Local media reported that the note indicated the slayings were in retribution for the capture of 25 drug suspects in a nearby town. LeBaron's younger brother, Eric, was kidnapped in May and returned unharmed after a week. The incident prompted LeBaron to become a nationally recognized anti-crime activist who moved the local community to take a stand. ""There are no leaders here, or we are all leaders,"" LeBaron's brother, Julian LeBaron, told CNN television affiliate KINT in El Paso, Texas. ""If they kill my brother another three will take his place, and if they kill us, another hundred will take their place. We are not giving up. No way."" The LeBaron brothers belonged to the ""Community of LeBaron"" in the Municipality of Galeana, a township founded by ex-communicated Mormons.","Benjamin LeBaron and his brother-in-law are shot dead in their home .

"PARIS, France (CNN)  -- French Culture Minister Frederic Mitterrand said Thursday he will not resign over accounts in a book he wrote in 2005 about paying to have sex with ""boys"" in Thailand. Frederic Mitterrand admitted to paying for sex with  ""boys"" in his 2005 autobiography, ""The Bad Life."" In an interview with French television network TF1, Mitterrand said he ""absolutely condemn[s] sexual tourism, which is a disgrace, and ... pedophilia,"" in which he insisted he has never participated. Despite the use of the French word ""garcon"" in his 2005 book ""The Bad Life,"" Mitterrand, 62, has previously said the term did not mean ""little boys."" He said the males he paid for sex were his age, or maybe five years younger, but not underage -- and the relations were consensual. ""Anyway, you can recognize someone who's 40 years old ..."" he told TF1. A 40-year-old man ""doesn't look like a minor,"" he added, suggesting that his partners were middle-aged men. His actions, Mitterrand said, were ""without a doubt, an error,"" but ""a crime, no,"" he said in the interview. Despite recent calls to resign from the far-right National Front and the left-leaning Socialist Party, Mitterrand, who is openly gay, vowed to stay in his job. He said he met Thursday morning with French President Nicolas Sarkozy, and that the president supports him. In a July interview with the weekly French news magazine Le Nouvel Observateur, Sarkozy said he had read Mitterrand's book, and found it ""courageous and talented."" The controversy over the revelations in his book -- which he called neither autobiography nor memoir -- erupted anew after Mitterrand deplored the arrest last week of filmmaker Roman Polanski, who fled the United States in 1977 after pleading guilty to having sex with a 13-year-old girl. The culture minister told TF1 that he was ""too emotional"" when he denounced the filmmaker's arrest in Switzerland as ""horrifying."" ""To see him thrown to the lions for an old story that really has no meaning, and to see him alone, imprisoned, when he was going to attend a ceremony where he was to be honored, that is to say, he was trapped, it's absolutely horrifying,"" he said October 4, according to Agence France Presse. The far-right National Front organized an anti-Mitterrand demonstration in Paris on Thursday evening. ""Send this message on to everyone who will not put up with this indecency!"" the party's Web site said. The party's vice president, Marine Le Pen, has demanded Mitterrand's resignation for what she termed his sexually deviant acts. Mitterrand responded, saying, ""It's an honor to be dragged through the mud by the National Front."" Mitterrand's acts of ""sexual tourism"" have left ""a dark smudge"" on the government, Le Pen said. The group is also gathering signatures on a petition, online and on paper, from those who want Mitterrand to step down. ""We really hope he will resign,"" National Front communications director Julien Sanchez told CNN. ""It's an embarrassment for our country, that our culture minister has done this. It affects our international image. It's not right,"" he added.  Watch report on the controversy surrounding French Culture Minister Frederic Mitterand » . On the other side of the political spectrum, the left-leaning Socialist Party suggested Sarkozy should consider Mitterrand's position. ""It's up to President Sarkozy to decide whether or not we can be involved in the fight against child prostitution and sexual tourism, and whether or not the acts written in an autobiography -- written by a minister -- are acts of sexual commerce,"" said party spokesman Benoit Hamon. ""If everything is relative and Mr. Mitterrand can be excused because he's famous, well, I don't excuse his behavior,"" Hamon said. Martine Aubry, the leader of the Socialist Party, said she would wait until she had read the book before making any judgment. Mitterrand said on TF1 that he had had sexual relations with boys -- using the French word ""garcons"" -- but added, ""you must not confuse pedophilia with homosexuality."" He also described his book as a mixture of his life and the life of others, and denied accusations that it was a glorification of sexual tourism. The minister said he never had sex with ""young boys"" and denounced those who accused him of such acts, saying that maybe they were confusing their own fantasies with what the book was really about. Mitterrand told an interviewer in 2005 that assertions that he liked ""little boys"" were untrue. ""It's because when people say 'boys' we imagine 'little boys,'"" he said then. ""How to explain that? It belongs to this general puritanism which surrounds us, which always makes us paint a black picture of the situation. It has nothing to do with that."" Mitterrand was a television personality, not a government minister, when the book was published. It caused a stir upon its publication, as well, and has been the subject of heated debate several times since then. In one passage, published by the French newspaper Le Monde on Thursday, Mitterrand describes in detail a sexual encounter with a ""boy"" he said was called Bird. ""My boy didn't say a word, he stood before me, immobile, his eyes still straight ahead and a half-smile on his lips. I wanted him so badly I was trembling,"" he wrote. Mitterrand also wrote about visiting clubs to choose young male prostitutes in Thailand -- where prostitution is illegal and sexual intercourse with a minor is statutory rape and is punishable by imprisonment. ""Most of them are young, handsome and apparently unaware of the devastation that their activities could bring them. I would learn later that they didn't come every night, that they were often students, had a girlfriend and sometimes even lived with their families, who pretended not to know the source of their breadwinner's earnings,"" the book said. ""Some of them were older and there was also a small contingent of heavier bruisers, who also had their fans. It was the artistic side of the exposition: Their presence made the youthful charm of the others stand out."" He also wrote that while he had read reports and seen documentaries on the evils of ""le commerce des garcons"" (the boy trade) -- the misery, the piles of money from which ""les gosses"" (the kids) got only a few crumbs, the ravages of drugs -- ""all of these rituals of the fair of the youths, the slave market, excited me enormously."" ""The profusion of very attractive boys, immediately available, put me in a state of desire that I no longer had to restrain or conceal."" Mitterrand -- the nephew of the Socialist former president Francois Mitterrand -- joined Sarkozy's center-right government this summer. Wikipedia, the user-edited online reference Web site, has locked down Mitterrand's entry, preventing changes to it, in a possible sign of the intensity of the debate surrounding him. CNN's Jen Carswell in Paris, France and Alanne Orjoux in Atlanta, Georgia, contributed to this report.","Culture minister condemns sexual tourism, denies he is a pedophile .

"Buenos Aires, Argentina (CNN)  -- Argentina's capital city was beset by strikes Thursday, with teachers, doctors and transit employees refusing to work over money matters. Teachers and doctors in Buenos Aires went on strike Wednesday and are scheduled to go back to work Friday, the government-run Telam news agency and other outlets reported. Subway workers will go on strike Thursday night for a few hours, they said. This is the fourth work stoppage in the past six months for doctors. Only emergency cases are being treated. The doctors are not only seeking better salaries, but also improvements to the public health system. They are protesting ""the lack of money in the public system, the possibility that the health budget will be reduced by 500 million pesos (about $130 million), the lack of professionals, the lack of labor to solve the problems in Argentina's public health,"" said Alicia Kobylarz of the Federal Syndicate of Health Workers. The nation's public hospitals treat the poor and needy. Health professionals want the government to employ more doctors to meet rising patient loads and an increase in diseases and epidemics such as H1N1 flu and dengue fever. The hospitals depend on funding from the provinces, leading to major differences in each area's needs and what local health care facilities can offer. ""Provinces that have petroleum income, for example, are provinces that have better budgets, that have better hospitals"" said Aldo Neri, a former national health minister. ""There is much inequality in the treatment that the poor receive in Argentinean public hospitals depending on which province they live in. That's why I say the inequalities have increased."" The current health minister, Juan Manzur, said next year's health budget will have an increase of more than 15 percent, greater than the national budget, which will have a 12.4 percent increase. Teachers also want greater pay and announced Thursday they would go back on strike Tuesday because of failed talks with Buenos Aires Education Director Mario Oporto. The teachers say they want their raises by year's end. Oporto said there's no money for raises now, the official Telam news agency reported. ""The province's posture is very clear: There won't be raises in 2009 because there already have been,"" Oporto told a radio station, according to Telam. ""We're sorry about the work stoppage, and we are ready to keep working. This time we are very firm: There will be no raises in 2009."" Daniel Scioli, governor of Buenos Aires Province, said public education ""is our top priority"" but also emphasized there would be no raises this year, the news agency reported. Teachers' union leaders complained Thursday that government officials went to schools Wednesday to find out which teachers were there and which had joined the work stoppage, Telam said. Subway workers in Buenos Aires announced they will walk off the job at 7 p.m. Thursday. They, too, want pay raises. Educators also are on strike in neighboring Chile, where professors say they are owed a ""historic debt."" The indefinite strike entered its fourth day Thursday and negotiations are scheduled to resume Friday. Jaime Gajardo, president of Chile's College of Professors, told a local TV station there has been improvement in negotiations with the government and the talks could advance noticeably in the next few days. Pablo Zalaquett, the mayor of Santiago, the capital of Chile, said the two sides are closer on a pay bonus the professors want. CNN's Javier Doberti contributed to this report.","Teachers, doctors in Buenos Aires scheduled to go back to work Friday .

"(CNN) -- An American who founded a home for needy children in Haiti more than 10 years ago has been accused of sexually abusing some of the same boys he set out to help, the U.S. Department of Justice announced Thursday. Project Pierre Toussaint operated on this street in Cap-Haitien, Haiti. An American allegedly abused boys there. Douglas Perlitz, 39, who was indicted this week by a grand jury in Fairfield County, Connecticut, faces 10 counts related to the sexual abuse of nine boys for about a decade, the Justice Department said. Seven of those counts are for traveling outside of the United States with the intent to have sex with minors, and three counts are for engaging in sexual conduct with minors in a foreign place, according to the indictment. Perlitz was arrested Wednesday morning at his home in Colorado, but he had lived for years in Haiti, the Justice Department said in a news release. The Haiti Fund Inc., the nonprofit fundraising arm of his project, was incorporated in Connecticut, where Perlitz had attended Fairfield University. A U.S. magistrate ordered Perlitz detained pending a federal court hearing Friday in Denver. Perlitz was in custody Thursday, and it was not clear whether he had retained an attorney. The Justice Department said Perlitz used his position as director of the Project Pierre Toussaint in Haiti to manipulate and abuse the boys. He allegedly enticed the nine boys with promises of food and shelter and with gifts such as cell phones and cash, the indictment states. If convicted, Perlitz faces a maximum of 30 years in prison and fine of $2.5 million, according to the department. Haiti's abject poverty, threadbare social-service network and barely functioning legal system combine to make the country's street kids particularly vulnerable to exploitation. Despite its lush tropical setting, the country is the poorest in the Western Hemisphere and has the highest rates of mortality among infants and children under five years of age. One-third of Haitian children under five suffer chronic malnutrition, according to United Nations statistics; just over half of school-age kids are enrolled in schools. With the state unable to alleviate those ills, private foreign charities work hard to fill the void. Perlitz -- and his Project Pierre Toussaint -- were seen as bright young examples of how outside agencies could make a difference in the lives of destitute Haitian children, offering food, education and sanctuary from the perilous life on the streets. In 2002, Fairfield University, Perlitz's alma mater, honored his efforts by making him its commencement speaker. One volunteer who traveled twice to Project Pierre Toussaint to run a soccer and basketball camp there said the charges against Perlitz were shocking. ""I don't believe one ounce of it,"" Matt Pawlick of Miami, Florida, told CNN. ""He had a passion and love to help those kids grow."" According to the indictment, Perlitz first traveled to Haiti as a student at Fairfield University and became inspired to build a school there. In 1997, he received a grant from the Roman Catholic Order of Malta to start a center to help street children, which grew into a boarding school for boys that provided meals, sports activities and classroom instruction, the indictment states. The school was in Cap-Haitien, Haiti. Once the Haiti Fund was created, it raised more than $2 million between 2002 and 2008, funds that were transferred to Perlitz to run the project, the indictment said. According to the court document, Perlitz would take some of the minors to a restaurant, give them food and alcohol and then encourage them to spend the night with him. The indictment alleges that Perlitz showed homosexual pornography to some of the youths as well. In 2007, Haitian journalist Cyrus Sibert was the first to report about rumors of sexual abuse at the school. ""I found many children who told me the situation at the project,"" Sibert told CNN, referring to the allegations. His reports spurred investigations by Haitian authorities as well as by the board of directors of the Haiti Fund. The indictment alleges that ""Perlitz used his relationship with a religious leader and influential board members to continue to conceal, and attempt to conceal, illegal sexual conduct,"" in one instance by barring investigators from entering his room, and by helping remove two computers that were locked in a safe. As attention over the allegations grew, the board ultimately dismissed Perlitz in 2008, Paul Kendrick, an advocate for victims of abuse by clergy familiar with the case, told CNN. Kendrick, a fellow Fairfield University graduate who met Perlitz during a visit to Haiti, said the removal proved controversial among the backers of Project Pierre Toussaint. By early 2009, the school was closed, Sibert said. Board members referred questions from CNN to an attorney, who was not immediately available.","Feds: Douglas Perlitz, 39, faces 10 counts in alleged abuse of nine boys .

"(CNN) -- Three U.S. researchers have won the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for solving ""a major problem in biology,"" the Nobel Committee announced Monday. Jack Szostak, from left, Carol Greider and Elizabeth Blackburn will share the $1.4 million prize. Elizabeth H. Blackburn, Carol W. Greider and Jack W. Szostak are credited with discovering how chromosomes are protected against degradation -- a field that could shed light on human aging and diseases, including cancer. ""The award of the Nobel Prize recognizes the discovery of a fundamental mechanism in the cell, a discovery that has stimulated the development of new therapeutic strategies,"" the committee said in a news release. The three will share the $1.4 million prize. It is the 100th year the prize will be awarded, and the first time that any Nobel in the sciences has gone to more than one woman. The work that won them the prize took place in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It centers on structures at the end of chromosomes called telomeres and an enzyme that forms them, called telomerase. As cells divide, chromosomes need to be replicated perfectly. Work by the researchers determined that telomeres protect DNA from degradation in the process, and that telomerase maintains the telomeres. Though there had been some speculation that the three scientists were being considered for the Nobel, the committee keeps its work top secret -- and all three researchers said they were surprised. Szostak told CNN he got the news in ""that classic early morning phone call from Stockholm."" He described it as ""surprising and exciting"" -- perhaps particularly for him because he has not worked on the subject for the past 20 years. ""I've been working on other things,"" he said. ""It started off as a collaboration with me and Liz [Blackburn] -- Carol [Greider] was a student of hers."" The work began as ""a long-standing puzzle that we were interested in solving,"" he said. ""It was only over later years that it emerged, through the work of many people, that this was probably important for aging and cancer."" How it might help fight such diseases is not yet known, Szostak said. ""It will take a while yet for that to be figured out."" Blackburn and Greider did not immediately return calls from CNN. In a telephone conversation with the editor-in-chief of the Nobel Prize Web site nobelprize.org, Greider said she had been attracted to the field of research because ""it seemed like the unanswered question."" She also said telomere research has a higher proportion of women than other fields because in its early days, the lead researchers brought women into the field. She called it a situation in which ""you have someone that trains a lot of women and then there's a slight gravitation of women to work in the labs with other women."" She added, ""I think actively promoting women in science is very important because the data has certainly shown that there has been an underrepresentation. And I think that the things that contribute to that are very many ... subtle, social kinds of things."" Blackburn, in a separate conversation posted on the Web site, said the proportion of women in telomere research is ""fairly close to the biological ratio of men and women."" ""It's all the other fields that are aberrant,"" she added, laughing. The field of study intrigued her because ""it's so intricate and complicated, and you want to know how it works,"" she said. Blackburn was Greider's supervisor at the University of California, Berkeley. Now Blackburn is at the University of California, San Francisco. Greider is a professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland. Szostak was previously at Harvard Medical School and is currently professor of genetics at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts. Married with two children, he told CNN he has ""no idea"" what he'll do with his portion of the monetary prize -- about $467,000. CNN asked whether he thinks his children, ages 9 and 12, will suddenly think dad's work is ""really cool."" ""Well,"" Szostak said, laughing, ""maybe."" CNN's Josh Levs contributed to this report.","NEW: Nobel Committee says prizewinners solved ""a major problem in biology""

"(CNN)  -- Manny Pacquiao returned home to a hero's welcome in his native Philippines on Friday after wresting the WBO welterweight title from Miguel Cotto on a 12th round technical knockout in Las Vegas. 'Pacman' has a fanatical following in the Philippines which has been further enhanced by his record breaking victory as he claimed his sixth world title at a different weight by beating Cotto on Saturday night. ""Welcome home, the world's bext boxer of all time,"" read a banner as thousands of fans greeted the 30-year-old. Following his hard-fought victory over Puerto Rican Cotto, all the talk is of a cash-rich superfight with American Floyd Mayweather Jr. next year. Leading promoter Bob Arum said he is ready to put the pay-per-view extravaganza at the 147-pound welterweight class, with Las Vegas the preferred venue. Pacquiao played down the possibility as he talked to reporters on his return. ""We are not forcing a fight with him. It is right that he is the one challenging me, because my fights score more on pay-per-view,"" he said. Pacquiao has greatly enhanced his reputation with successive wins over Oscar de la Hoya, Britain's Ricky Hatton and Cotto. Mayweather returned to the ring with a comfortable win over Juan Manuel Marquez and has the reputation for grossing massive receipts from his pay-per-view appearances. For the moment, Pacquiao will spend time at home with his wife, Jinkee, and three children and is also set to pursue his ambition to enter Filippino politics, standing for a congressional seat in his home island of Mindanao.","Manny Pacquiao returns home to Philippines after Las Vegas triumph .

"Las Vegas, Nevada (CNN) -- To most people these days, an ""app"" is something you download on your smartphone to help you do a specific task -- say, find a good nearby restaurant. But big tech companies, seeing how applications have boosted the appeal of gadgets such as Apple's iPhone, are starting to view apps as low-cost enhancements for a broader range of products, from netbooks to TVs and beyond. At the International Consumer Electronics Show here this week, microchip maker Intel launched an app store geared towards netbook computers. Not to be outdone, Samsung announced it will open its own app store for HDTVs, Blu-ray players and mobile phones. Even unlikely players such as Ford Motor Co. are getting in on the app act. Ford announced Thursday that several applications, including one that will read aloud Twitter tweets while you're driving, will be available on many of its vehicles later this year. What's driving this sudden app movement? ""Mobile computer chips have gotten so powerful and affordable, and it's so easy to get on the Internet, that it doesn't make much sense to ship a gadget with dedicated, stagnant functionality,"" said Brian X. Chen, who covers technology for Wired.com. ""Add an Internet connection and a software platform open for third-party programmers to develop for -- i.e., open an app store -- and you can enhance the capabilities of a gadget, thus future-proofing it, at no cost."" Sales of the apps, which typically cost a few dollars apiece, also create a new source of revenue for the device's manufacturer, Chen said. And consumers win, too: They get more value out of their product without having to keep buying new hardware. Software applications have been around for decades, but it took the recent success of the iPhone and Apple's App Store -- with their can-do slogan, ""there's an app for that"" -- to make apps sexy on the consumer level. Developers have created more than 100,000 apps for the store -- at no cost to Apple, which takes a cut of revenues. Less than 18 months after the store launched in 2008, owners of the iPhone and iPod Touch have downloaded more than 3 billion applications. Rival smartphone makers such as Palm and Research in Motion soon followed with app stores of their own. It's now standard for Web properties such as Facebook, Google and eBay to have mobile apps that let users share updates or make purchases on the go. The number of people who use Internet-enabled mobile devices is expected to pass 1 billion by 2013, according to industry analysts, meaning that demand for apps will only grow. And as more people grow accustomed to using apps to quickly check the weather or send a tweet on Twitter, more manufacturers will develop apps-ready products, experts say. On Thursday Intel launched a beta version of its app store, called the Intel AppUp center, for netbooks, the smaller, simpler cousins of laptops. About 100 apps, in such categories as entertainment, games, health, social networking, are now available for download at www.intelappup.com. The beta store will host apps for both Microsoft Windows and the open-source Moblin operating system, which target the popular netbook computer category powered by Intel's Atom processor. ""Apps have been defined in people's minds as these little things that run on the iPhone. Our focus is on getting lots of smart people to think of the netbook as a device they can target [for developing apps],"" said Peter Biddle, who run's Intel's Atom software program. Eventually, Intel and its partners expect to expand the store to include applications for smartphones, TVs and even consumer electronic appliances. Meanwhile, Samsung is betting that as television merges with the Internet, more channel-surfers will enjoy being able to order a movie from Netflix or scroll through photos on Picasa without having to leave their couch. Samsung is calling Samsung Apps ""the world's first HDTV-based application store,"" although it's not expected to launch until later this year. Samsung has opened the store to third-party developers and hopes to have more than 150 apps available for download by the end of 2010. Many content partners have already signed up. ""There's going to be an application for everything,"" said Samsung product training manager Jermain Anderson, who envisions guys sitting around a living room, playing Texas hold 'em poker on a big-screen TV while holding their virtual cards on their smartphones. Suddenly, a TV becomes more than a TV -- it's also a computer screen and a gaming console. ""The idea is to make everyone's life more convenient without them having to go to more than one place to do it,"" Anderson said. ""Down the road, the app store will bring a lot of different Samsung products together."" Soon, apps will even be coming to the highway. Ford has signed agreements with three partners: the Pandora music service, Stitcher Internet radio and OpenBeak, which helps users send and receive messages via Twitter. Drivers will not be able to read the tweets on the dashboard -- instead, a computer voice will say them aloud. The three apps would live on users' smartphones but would be controlled in the vehicle through Ford's SYNC system, which allows motorists to operate mobile devices through voice commands or steering-wheel controls. The apps will be available later this year for any Ford vehicle with a SYNC system. ""When we saw the apps craze ... [we realized] there's a consumer demand there,"" said Alan Hall, a technology communications manager at Ford. Hall was quick to say that Ford would not approve apps -- such as video games -- that might distract the driver. ""Apps are becoming the norm for how people quickly and easily access the information they want,"" Hall added. ""People are used to getting information on demand. They have a digital life outside the car -- they should have a digital life inside the car.""","Companies are opening app stores and bringing applications to TVs, netbooks and even cars .

"KAMPALA, Uganda (CNN) -- Police in Uganda have arrested and extradited a man who is among the most wanted suspects from the Rwandan genocide. The 100-day killing rampage led to the loss of an estimated 10 percent of Rwanda's population. IIdephonse Nizeyimana was picked up at a hotel in Rubaga, a suburb of the capital, Kampala, by the National Central Bureau of Interpol, according to a news release from the U.N.-sponsored International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) on Tuesday. He was transferred Tuesday to a U.N. detention facility in Arusha, Tanzania, where the tribunal is based. Top officials who allegedly took part in the genocide, such as army generals and politicians, are tried by the tribunal. ""Nizeyimana is one of the four top accused who are earmarked by the prosecutor to be tried by the tribunal in Arusha after their arrest as part of the ICTR completion strategy,"" the tribunal's news release said. Of a list of 13 fugitives, he is the second to be arrested in less than two months, it said. In the attacks that started in April 1994, Hutu militias and members of the general population sought out Tutsis and moderate Hutus, and went on a 100-day killing rampage. Civilians and children got incentives to take part in the atrocities, including promises of land belonging to their Tutsi neighbors. It was one of the most brutal genocides in modern history. Some figures put the number of dead at 1 million -- 10 percent of the population of the central African nation. Millions more were raped and disfigured. A whole generation of children lost their parents. Nizeyimana was a captain the Rwanda Armed Forces, the tribunal said. He is accused of exercising authority over soldiers and personnel through a chain of command, and allegedly sent a section of soldiers to execute of Rosalie Gicanda, a former queen of Rwanda who was a ""symbolic figure for all Tutsis,"" it said. The tribunal noted this marks the second time Uganda has cooperated with it to make an arrest. ""The tribunal has commended the Interpol and the Ugandan authorities for their close cooperation,"" the news release said.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Bernie McDaid was an 11-year-old altar boy when his priest began molesting him, one of 50 boys who have said they were molested by the same man. Olan Horne, from left, Faith Johnston and Bernie McDaid met with the pope Thursday. Like with so many victims of abuse, McDaid's young life spiraled. He turned to drugs and alcohol in his teen years, struggling to cope with what ""Father B"" had done to him. On Thursday, he finally got a chance to do something he'd hoped for decades: He met with the Holy Father and told him about the abuse he had suffered. ""I basically told him that I was an altar boy ... a young boy praying to God at the time that I was abused,"" McDaid said. ""It wasn't just sexual abuse, it was spiritual abuse, and I want you to know that.""   ""And then I told him that he has a cancer growing in his ministry and needs to do something about it. And I hope he hears me right, and I touched his heart. And he nodded.""  Watch victims describe abuse and pope's apology » . McDaid was part of a small group of victims of the sexual abuse scandal that rocked the Roman Catholic Church who met with Pope Benedict XVI on Thursday. They shared their stories with the pope in a Washington chapel in what the victims called an emotional, frank and ultimately hope-filled meeting. Faith Johnston clutched her mother's rosary beads as she tried to speak to the pope. But her emotions took over. ""I didn't end up saying anything. I got up to him, and I burst into tears,"" said Johnston, who at 14 was molested by her priest. ""I think just my tears alone spoke -- just spoke so much."" She added, ""I hope that other survivors can hear about this, see this and get the same hope that we've gotten from it."" Olan Horne said the pope first apologized to them in what he called an ""unscripted"" and ""free-flowing"" meeting. ""We were all able to answer all of the questions that needed to be asked and for him to respond to. And he did -- and he did forthright,"" Horne said. ""He seemed to intrinsically understand what we were talking about. And he spoke to those issues to each one of us in a spiritual way, in a pastoral way. And he also was very respectful of where and what we wanted to talk about."" Horne added, ""My hope was restored today from what I heard. And I believe we received a promise."" Horne and McDaid both accused the same priest, the Rev. Joseph Birmingham, of molesting them. Birmingham died in 1989. The Rev. Federico Lombardi, a papal spokesman, said the pope listened to everyone's ""personal accounts and offered them words of encouragement and hope."" The surprise meeting came during the pope's visit, the first trip to the United States by the Holy Father since the abuse scandal rocked the church in the early 2000s. The meeting is believed to be the first between a pope and the victims of clergy sexual abuse. The Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, the nation's oldest and largest support group for clergy abuse victims, said it was pleased that the pope met with the victims but hopes the church will do more. ""This is a small, long overdue step forward on a very long road. We're confident the meeting was meaningful for the participants, and we're grateful that these victims have had the courage to come forward and speak up,"" the group said. ""But fundamentally, it won't change things. Kids need action. Catholics deserve action. Action produces reform, and reform, real reform, is sorely needed in the church hierarchy."" Earlier Thursday, celebrating Mass in center field at Washington's new ballpark, the pope gave a 20-minute homily that focused on hope, repentance, unity and reconciliation among the 70 million Catholics in the United States.  ""It is in the context of this hope, born of God's love and fidelity, that I acknowledge the pain which the church in America has experienced as the result of sexual abuse of minors,"" Benedict said. ""No words of mine could describe the pain and harm inflicted by such abuse. It is important that those who have suffered be given loving pastoral attention."" McDaid was sitting in the audience with his mother when he heard those words.  Watch pope's apology 'blew me away' » . ""I had tears in my eyes that I wasn't ready to have. It was an incredible moment for me,"" he said. Now, he hopes the church will follow through. ""We're at the beginning of a new start, and there's real hope this time. It's not just words. I think there's going to be action following this moment now.""  E-mail to a friend .","Victim: I was ""a young boy praying to God at the time that I was abused""

"(CNN)  -- A controversial Colombian senator who has obtained the release of 16 hostages held by Marxist guerrillas is the leading candidate to receive this year's Nobel Peace Prize, which will be announced Friday, said an independent research institute in Norway. Sen. Piedad Cordoba, right, of Colombia reportedly is one of three top contenders for the Nobel Peace Prize. Sen. Piedad Cordoba is the most likely recipient among three leading contenders, said the Oslo-based International Peace Research Institute. The others the institute named are Jordanian Prince Ghazi bin Muhammad, a philosophy professor in Islamic faith at Jordan University, and Afghan physician and human rights activist Sima Samar. Though the institute considers Cordoba the front-runner, no single candidate has emerged as the clear-cut favorite, as sometimes happens, said Kristian Berg Harpviken, director of the peace institute. ""It really is quite open this year,"" Harpviken said. This year's peace prize nominees include 172 people and 33 organizations. The committee does not release the names of the nominees. The 50-year-old peace institute, which is often called PRIO, has no connection with the Nobel committee that awards the peace prize. Harpviken said he believes the prize will go to an individual or organization engaged in the resolution of a protracted armed conflict. ""This is a [Nobel] committee that will perhaps be more proactive and will award somebody involved in a standing process rather than rewarding someone for past accomplishments,"" he said. Cordoba, 54, heads Colombians for Peace, a group trying to end to the 45-year-old war between the government and the guerrilla Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as the FARC. Since 2007, she has obtained the release of 16 hostages held by the FARC and has gotten commitments from the rebels for the release of several more. Colombian officials have said the guerrillas are holding about 700 captives. A government critic and longtime peace activist, Cordoba was kidnapped by a right-wing paramilitary group in 1999. She was released after several weeks and then fled to Canada with her family, where she stayed for 14 months before returning home. There have been at least two assassinations attempts against her. ""While it is the hostage releases that have brought Cordoba and her organization the most attention, her role as a principal proponent of peace negotiations and of long-term reconciliation is probably more important to her candidacy for the Nobel Peace Prize,"" PRIO said in a release. Harpviken said he had received many complaints because of his prediction about Cordoba, whom critics accuse of being too close to the rebels. ""I do realize that this created some debate in Colombia,"" he said. ""That's not terribly surprising."" Cordoba was nominated by Argentinean human rights activist Adolfo Perez Esquivel, winner of the 1980 Nobel Peace Prize. Harpviken said Muhammad, an Islamic scholar known for trying to bridge gaps with other faiths, also is a leading candidate. ""Certainly, the purpose ... he stands for makes him very strong,"" Harpviken said. A member of the Jordanian royal family and educated at Princeton and Cambridge universities, where he received a doctorate, Muhammad, 42, ""is playing an increasingly central role as an advocate of interfaith dialogue,"" PRIO said. In 2005, the prince brought together 170 Islamic scholars from 40 countries for the Amman Initiative to work out what they called a ""theological counter-attack against terrorism."" Two years later, Muhammad and other prominent Islamic scholars wrote a letter called ""A Common Word Between Us and You"" that urged mutual understanding and peace with Christians. The letter, PRIO said, was partly a response to Pope Benedict XVI's 2006 lecture that many saw as an attack on Islam. Backing his words with his deeds, Muhammad gave what was considered a broadly accommodating welcoming speech when the pope visited Jordan this year. ""The importance of Prince Ghazi's initiatives to date lies first and foremost in the way he engages Islamic theology, institutions and leaders in a debate on the relationship between Islam and other faiths, thereby contributing a wider platform for interreligious dialogue for Muslims in general,"" PRIO said. ""A prize to Prince Ghazi would also be recognition of the long-standing efforts of the Jordanian royal family, including King Abdullah, who have been long-standing proponents of peace and reconciliation in the Middle East."" If Muhammad does not win, Harpviken said, it could be because his work is not done. ""He still has a way to go so that his ideas have an impact,"" Harpviken said. The third PRIO front-runner is Samar, head of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission and the U.N. special envoy to Darfur in Africa. A medical doctor, Samar also established the Shuhada Organization, which focuses on health care, particularly for Afghan women. After obtaining her medical degree in 1982, Samar and her son fled to Pakistan in 1984 when the communist regime then ruling Afghanistan arrested her husband. Samar, 52, remained in exile until 2002 when she was appointed as a women's affairs minister in Afghan President Hamid Karzai's transitional administration. ""She has been under frequent attacks both from conservative religious leaders and from Islamist radicals, and she is a prominent voice for the rights of women,"" PRIO said, adding that she ""does invite respect by being a principled and outspoken proponent of human rights and the need for a true reconciliatory process."" According to other published reports, another possible pick is monk Thich Quang Do, head of the outlawed United Buddhist Church of Vietnam. He has been under house arrest since 2001 and has been in and out of jail since his first detention by communist authorities in 1977. Quang Do, 80, was awarded the annual human rights prize by the Rafto Foundation of Norway in 2006. Four recent Rafto winners have gone on to garner the Nobel Peace Prize: Aung San Suu Kyi of Myanmar (also known as Burma), Jose Ramos-Horta of East Timor, Kim Dae-jung of South Korea and Shirin Ebadi of Iran. Azerbaijani journalist and human rights activist Malahat Nasibova was awarded the Rafto this year and also is considered a possible Nobel prize winner. Chinese dissidents Hu Jia, Gao Zhisheng and Wei Jingsheng also are contenders, other observers said. After months of house arrest, Hu, 36, was detained in December 2007 during a crackdown on dissidents and sentenced to 3 1/2 years in April 2008 for ""inciting subversion of state power."" Hu started his activism focusing on HIV/AIDS in 2001 and co-founded a grassroots organization dedicated to helping children from AIDS families. The international human rights group Amnesty International said Hu's focus broadened and he began reporting on a wider human rights violations in China, even giving interviews to international journalists. Amnesty said Hu has been repeatedly beaten and harassed by police for his outspokenness. Before being arrested, he had publicly expressed concerns over human rights abuses by police in Beijing. Gao, who was born in 1966, is a self-taught lawyer and People's Liberation Army veteran who was a Nobel Peace Prize candidate last year. He disappeared in February after being taken away by Chinese police. Fellow activists say he is believed to still be alive. In 2007, he wrote a letter to the U.S. Congress urging the United States to boycott the Olympic Games held in Beijing the following year. In it, he described a wide array of human rights violations by the Chinese government -- from lack of property and religious rights to environmental disasters to Tibet. ""I ask to you to seriously consider the true value of morality, justice, and humanity, as well as to what extent such values are undermined in China,"" he said. Wei, 59, was first arrested in 1979 and sentenced to 15 years. He was released in 1993 but arrested again within six months and sentenced to 14 years. In 1997, Chinese authorities put him on a plane to the United States, where he has lived since. Perhaps the best known of the Chinese dissidents, Wei has been awarded the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Human Rights Award, the European Parliament's Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, the National Endowment for Democracy Award and the Olof Palme Memorial Prize. He has been nominated seven times for the peace prize. Harpviken said he doubts the Nobel committee will choose any Chinese or Russian dissidents this year because they ""don't want to anger powerful governments."" ""Although the committee takes pride in being independent,"" he said, ""there are certain limitations on their being independent."" That does not mean he doesn't expect the committee to ""take daring decisions."" Harpviken said he believes that ""the most likely expression of the committee's courage this year will be to award the prize either to an unconventional kind of candidate or to somebody whose work is likely to be directly helped by a prize award."" The peace prize is one of five awarded annually since 1901 by the Nobel Foundation in Stockholm, Sweden. The other four prizes are for physiology or medicine, physics, chemistry and literature. Starting in 1969, the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel also has been awarded. While the other prizes are awarded by committees based in Sweden, the peace prize is determined by a five-member panel appointed by the Norwegian parliament. The Nobel recipient receives a prize of 10 million Swedish crowns, or about $1.4 million.

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- Mexican federal police have arrested a fugitive on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list, Mexican authorities said. Jorge Alberto Lopez Orozco allegedly murdered his girlfriend and her two young sons. Jorge Alberto Lopez Orozco is wanted in Elmore County, Idaho, on charges that he shot and killed three people, the FBI said. The charred remains of a woman and her sons, ages 2 and 4, were found inside a burned-out vehicle on August 11, 2002, it said. Each victim had been shot in the head or chest. The FBI was still working Friday to confirm the identity of the man in custody, said Debbie Dujanovic, a spokeswoman in the agency's Salt Lake City, Utah, field office. The Salt Lake City office has jurisdiction in the case. An extradition order was issued in January 2007, the Mexican attorney general's office said in a news release Thursday. A reward of up to $100,000 was being offered, the FBI said. Lopez, 33, was captured in Zihuatanejo, a city northwest of Acapulco on the Pacific Coast in southern Mexico, the Mexican attorney general's office said. Zihuatanejo is in Guerrero state, but Lopez was transferred to a jail in neighboring Michoacan state, officials said. The arrest came about after investigation and intelligence work by Mexican authorities, the attorney general's office said. According to the FBI, Lopez abducted his girlfriend, Rebecca Ramirez, and her two young sons from her father's house in Nyssa, Oregon, on July 30, 2002. The car he had been driving was found nearly two weeks later on a rural road near Mountain Home, Idaho, officials said. It had been torched with the three bodies inside. The suspect's brother, Simon Lopez Orozco, and Simon's wife, Maria Cruz Garcia, have been charged with accessory to first-degree murder, the FBI said. Garcia was arrested in California three years ago, but Simon Lopez Orozco is believed still at large. Mexican officials captured another FBI Top 10 fugitive on July 17. Emigdio Preciado Jr. was wanted in connection with the shooting of two Los Angeles County, California, sheriff's deputies in September 2000. He had been charged with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution, attempted murder of a police officer.","Jorge Alberto Lopez Orozco is wanted in Elmore County, Idaho, .

"Miami, Florida (CNN) -- From the custom-made, hand-beaded white dress to silver-studded high-heeled shoes, diamond jewelry and tiara, Jenny Ferro is preparing for a day she's dreamed about since she was 3 years old. ""I'm really excited,"" says Jenny, eagerly nodding her head. ""Really, really, a lot!"" She isn't getting married. The 15-year-old is preparing for her quinceañera, a coming-of-age ritual in Latin culture, marking a young girl's entrance into womanhood. The centuries-old tradition began as a ceremony to introduce girls to society on their 15th birthday and signified that they were ready for marriage. Today, many quinceañeras have become much more elaborate. Jenny and her mother, Marlene Ferro, have worked out every detail of the party well in advance, from the rehearsal to the reception to the flower girl and the music. The theme of the party is bedazzled. First, there is the dress, which Marlene had designed specially for her daughter. It cost about $800. Then there are the shoes, high-heeled and silver to match the dress. During the party, the high heels will be ceremoniously slipped onto her feet to replace her flat shoes -- a symbolic transition of her journey from childhood to womanhood. ""It makes her look like a princess,"" gushes Marlene Ferro. Quinceañeras are becoming increasingly popular in the United States. One reason for their popularity is a greater acceptance of Latin culture in America, according to Michele Salcedo, author of ""Quinceañera!"" a comprehensive guide to the celebration. ""The 15th birthday, culturally, is a milestone. It doesn't have to be celebrated with a party at all, but it is generally marked by something quite special,"" Salcedo says. Experts believe the quinceañera is rooted in Mayan, Aztec and European traditions. Today, many coming-of-age ceremonies resemble lavish ""Sweet 16"" celebrations. Beyond the elaborate apparel, food and festivities, modern quinceañeras often feature a court of 15 people, typically consisting of family and friends. As the event continues to grow in popularity, the makeup of the court has also changed. ""It has gone beyond Latinos, so that a lot of Latino girls will have not only family members in court but they will reach out to non-Latino friends,"" says Salcedo. ""So it's a way of reaching out and extending social ties and bringing people in who might not otherwise have an opportunity to know a Latino family and to know the culture."" Family plays the largest role in the quinceañera, leading up to and during the party. Mothers, fathers, grandparents and godparents can spend years preparing a night to remember for the young girl. The tradition is just as important to the family as it is to the young woman. The large, extravagant celebrations often symbolize a family's hard work and success. How has America changed Latinos? Marlene Ferro, who emigrated from Cuba as a child with her parents, says Jenny's quinceañera was a gift to both of them. The 43-year-old, single mother of three, saved for years and estimates that she spent at least $20,000 on her daughter's quinceañera. ""I was able to accomplish something that I had been looking forward to for 15 years,"" says Marlene Ferro. The parties can be as big and expensive as a family can imagine and costs can escalate into the hundreds of thousands of dollars, according to Salcedo. She recommends that families manage expectations before the party planning even begins. iReporter Alexis Fernandez's quinceañera was a big event in Alaska . ""Sometimes people go way overboard and [spend] much more on the celebration than they can afford and that's the downside of the quinceañera,"" says Salcedo. ""Because when it's done right it can be a beautiful family celebration and a celebration of a milestone that a young girl goes through."" Quinceañeras have changed over the years. Even though her tiara was taller than her daughter's, Marlene says her quinceañera was simple. It was a small gathering at her sister's apartment with family and friends. She wore borrowed jewelry from a family member, had a homemade cake and danced with her father. Marlene Ferro's 15th birthday present was a telephone in her bedroom. ""I didn't have a big quince party. I chose to have a small party with my friends,"" she remembers. ""My dress was really easy ... I didn't have an option. It was this one or that one. Now, we give our kids the option."" iReporter Diamond Ramirez's mother, grandmother never had quinceañeras . There's a spiritual element to these celebrations as well, says Salcedo. The church plays a role in helping to prepare teenage girls for this transition to womanhood. Ceremonies and classes before the coming-of-age celebration teach the young women that with adulthood come certain responsibilities, both physical and spiritual. ""When it's done in the spirit that it probably should be, the girl has certain responsibilities and by the end of the process, she's met them and she has showed her mother that she can, in fact, be responsible and she does acquire ... a bit more maturity then she [had] before,"" says Salcedo. As the celebrations become more popular in the United States, they also offer an opportunity for more Americans to participate. ""It's a way to push back a lot of the negativity that a lot of Latinos feel is directed at Latinos,"" says Salcedo. ""It is a way for people who have recently arrived, or maybe not so recently arrived, to say 'I have done well here' ... I'm throwing this party for my daughter and I'm inviting all of you to partake of my generosity so that you can see exactly how well we've done.""","Quinceañeras, or 15th birthday celebrations, mark a girl's transition to womanhood .

"(OPRAH.com) -- When the first book of the ""Twilight"" series was released in October 2005, no one could have guessed the phenomenon it would become. Four years later, 70 million copies have been sold worldwide. The books have spent 143 weeks on the New York Times best-seller list, and the first movie in ""The Twilight Saga"" grossed $380 million at the box office. The story, a love triangle between a vampire, a human and a werewolf, has ignited an international frenzy, and the woman behind it all is 35-year-old author Stephenie Meyer. Once a stay-at-home mom, Stephenie says the idea for ""Twilight"" came to her in a dream. ""It was two people in kind of a little circular meadow with really bright sunlight, and one of them was a beautiful, sparkly boy and one was just a girl who was human and normal, and they were having this conversation. The boy was a vampire, which is so bizarre that I'd be dreaming about vampires, and he was trying to explain to her how much he cared about her and yet at the same time how much he wanted to kill her,"" Stephenie says. ""It really captured my imagination."" That dream became Chapter 13 of ""Twilight."" Oprah.com: Get your Twilight"" primer . Before the night of the dream, Stephenie says she had lost herself a little in the work of motherhood. ""I was really burned out. I really had gotten into that zombie mom way of doing things where I wasn't Stephenie anymore,"" she says. ""[Writing ""Twilight] was a release. That was the dam bursting. I'd been bottling up who I was for so long, I needed an expression."" Though she'd been married for 15 years, Stephenie says she didn't tell her husband at first about her new passion. ""My husband thought I'd gone crazy. I'd barely spoken to him because I had all these things going on in my head, and I wasn't telling him about this weird vampire obsession because I knew he'd freak out and think I'd lost my mind,"" she says. At first, Stephenie was documenting her dream only to make sure she would remember it, she says. ""The dream was just something I was so interested in, and it was so different from what my everyday was at the time,"" she says. ""I just wanted to remember it so badly. That's why I started writing it down -- not because I thought this would be a great story for a novel."" Oprah.com: Read an excerpt from ""Twilight"" Though Stephenie had been an avid reader all her life, she says she was never a writer before ""Twilight."" ""It seems kind of presumptuous to me [to think] anyone else would want to read the things that are in my head,"" she says. ""I didn't think of it [as a book]. I did the dream. And then I wanted to see what would happen with them. It was just me spending time with this fantasy world, and then when it was finished it was like, 'This is long enough to be a book!'"" Before ""Twilight,"" Stephenie says she read every type of book except for horror. ""That was the genre I just knew I was too chicken for,"" she says. ""I read a little bit of everything. ... When I was 8, I was reading ""Gone with the Wind"" and ""Pride and Prejudice"" and all that, not knowing it wasn't my reading level."" Oprah.com: Gift ideas for every reader on your list . Now that ""Twilight"" is a huge success, it's hard to imagine any literary agent rejecting it. But Stephenie says she'd submitted it to plenty of people before she was signed. ""I got nine rejections, five no answers and then one 'I'd like to read more,'"" she says. Stephenie says it was her sister who really pushed her to keep submitting it to more agents. ""She was the only one in the world who knew what I was doing,"" she says. These days, the ""Twilight""series is more than just a literary hit. The first two movies have also created a stir and catapulted three young stars into the limelight. British actor Robert Pattinson, who plays the lead vampire Edward Cullen, is now an international heartthrob. ""I knew that the problem was going to be Edward, because he's the perfect vampire,"" Stephenie says. ""How do you cast that from your pool of human actors?"" When producers found Robert, Stephenie says it was a perfect fit. ""He's got something about him. He doesn't look like everybody else. There's something unusual,"" she says. ""There are moments where he looks exactly like he did in my head."" Stephenie says casting Bella, the book's protagonist, was a bit easier. ""There's plenty of people who look like the girl next door,"" she says. ""We were really lucky [to cast] Kirsten Stewart, who is a phenomenal actress. I didn't know if we were going to get that caliber."" Though Twi-hards, as fans are called, know most everything about the series, Stephenie says there is one secret she's never revealed before. ""There was a different ending to ""New Moon"" originally,"" she says. ""It was a much quieter book. It was very much all in Bella's head."" Oprah.com: Are you a Twi-hard? Take the quiz! Stephenie says fans have her mother to thank for ""New Moon's"" current dramatic ending. ""My mom's like: 'You know, Stephenie, maybe a little more action at the end would be a good idea.

"(CNN) -- A suspect has been arrested in the slaying of a 19-year-old Puerto Rican man found Friday decapitated, dismembered and partially burned, police said Tuesday. Members of the U.S. gay community are asking authorities to investigate whether the slaying was a hate crime because the victim, Jorge Steven Lopez Mercado, was gay, said Pedro Julio Serrano of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. ""The brutality of the slaying and the fact that he was openly gay leads us to believe it was very possibly a hate crime,"" Serrano said. Authorities are investigating whether the killing involved sex, Guayama police Commander Hector Agosto Rodriguez told CNN affiliate WLII TV. Guayama prosecutor Jose Bermudez identified the suspect as Juan A. Martinez, 26. Police had earlier described him as a 27-year-old man from the interior Puerto Rican town of Cayey. Martinez was scheduled to attend a court hearing Tuesday night at which charges would be lodged, said Luis Bernier, a spokesman for the Guayama police district, which has jurisdiction in the case. The hearing was postponed several times throughout the day. Officials were waiting for a prosecutor from a nearby district, causing the delay, Bernier said. The FBI was not directly involved in the investigation Monday, said FBI Agent Harry Rodriguez of the San Juan office. ""The FBI is monitoring this investigation by police in Puerto Rico,"" Rodriguez said. ""Any assistance that the police requests or requires, we would be more than happy to provide."" Puerto Rican authorities may ask for help with forensics or other advanced investigative tools the FBI could provide, Rodriguez said. The U.S. attorney's office, in consultation with local officials and other agencies, would determine if the slaying was a hate crime, which is a federal offense. ""It's at a very preliminary stage,"" said Lymarie Llovet, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in San Juan, Puerto Rico's capital. Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory, which means federal agencies have jurisdiction. ""There's the potential for a federal investigation,"" Rodriguez said. The suspect was arrested Monday around 11:30 p.m. AST (10:30 p.m. ET) at his home in the Mogote de Cayey neighborhood, said Wilson Porrata Mariani, another spokesman for the Guayama police district. Police impounded two cars and also are investigating a home in another neighborhood, Huertas del Barrio Beatriz de Cidra. Lopez Mercado's body was found on Puerto Rico Road 184 in another part of town, Barrio Guavate de Cayey, police said. The slaying has reverberated throughout the gay and lesbian community in the United States, where supporters started a Facebook page called ""Justice for Jorge Steven Lopez -- End Hate Crimes."" The group demands an investigation by Puerto Rico Gov. Luis Fortuno and prosecution of the slaying under the Federal Hate Crimes Law. The law was enacted in 1969 to guard the rights of U.S. citizens engaged in any of six protected activities, such as voting, going to school, applying for a job or attending a public venue. Last month, President Obama signed into law the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which extends federal protection against illegal acts motivated by a person's actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or disability. Gay activist Serrano said he does not believe anti-gay sentiment is any stronger in Puerto Rico's Latin culture than anywhere else. ""That's a long-debunked myth, that our culture is more homophobic,"" Serrano said. Instead, he attributed any ill will toward gays to ""hate rhetoric"" by some religious and political leaders. One politician, he said, recently referred to gays as ""twisted and mentally ill."" ""That's the kind of rhetoric that incites violence against gays,"" Serrano said. Equality Forum, an international gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender rights organization, asked for a federal investigation. ""Equality Forum calls on U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to have the FBI investigate,"" said former federal prosecutor Malcolm Lazin, the group's executive director. ""The Matthew Shepard Amendment empowers and requires the federal government to prosecute this horrific murder."" Serrano said Lopez Mercado was a ""very, very dear friend"" he had met through a mutual acquaintance. ""Jorge was a person who you only needed one minute to fall in love with,"" Serrano said. Lopez Mercado often volunteered for gay causes, Serrano said. The teen's family is coping, considering the circumstances. ""It has been horrible, but they are very grateful that it has come to a quick resolution,"" Serrano said.","NEW: Activist attributes ill will toward gays to some religious, political leaders' ""hate rhetoric""

"Washington (CNN) -- State visits to the White House are full of show and symbolism, and Tuesday's visit by Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is no exception. But Singh's visit, the first state visit hosted by the Obama administration, reflects India's growing political and economic importance to the United States and the deepening partnership between Washington and New Delhi. The 2005 civil nuclear cooperation deal between the two countries symbolized a new status in U.S.-India relations. But that deal, yet to be ratified by the Indian parliament, was not in a vacuum. The Bush administration followed that up with agreements for increased cooperation on security, science and technology and education. Singh's visit this week will build on that, with announcements expected on a range of areas from the economy and defense to climate change and energy. India is a fellow democracy, and there is a strong Indian-American community in the U.S. So as it rises to power, India is a natural U.S. ally. On every big global issue today -- from the economy to climate change to fighting terrorism and curbing nuclear proliferation -- Washington needs New Delhi's cooperation. India is one of the biggest donors in Afghanistan, with $1.2 billion in aid. Although this has been met with suspicion in Pakistan, it has helped the United States, sharing some of the burden of stabilizing Afghanistan and providing civilian support. India is also considered a critical U.S. partner in dealing with other instability in the region, in places like Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Even as the U.S. deepens its cooperation with China on global issues, both Singh's government and the Obama administration want to manage China's meteoric rise. Strong U.S.-India ties help both countries ensure that the ""Asian century"" is not merely the ""Chinese century."" India has also become a major trading partner with the U.S., with $61 billion in trade in 2007. The U.S. is India's second-largest trading partner. And India is a major exporter of technology software and services to the U.S., and that's expected to increase as India strengthens its role as a global leader in technology. The relationship is not without its irritants, however, the biggest one being India's nuclear neighbor, Pakistan. India believes the U.S. has failed to curb Islamabad's backing of anti-India extremists based in Pakistan, and tensions between India and Pakistan remain high, especially with Pakistan's slow progress on the investigation into last year's Mumbai attack that killed 166 people. Before coming to Washington, Singh said that Pakistani objectives in Afghanistan aren't necessarily those of the U.S. Pakistan has long seen instability in Afghanistan as critical to its war strategy against India. India is also nervous about a possible integration of some Taliban into power in Afghanistan. Climate change is another point of friction. The U.S. wants India, one of world's the largest emitters of greenhouse gases, to accept limits on its carbon emissions. India maintains it is still a developing country and wants developed nations, like the U.S., to assume the lion's share of burden in dealing with climate change. Another potential difference looms over Iran. India has been careful not to support Iran's government, but if U.S. diplomacy with Iran fails, it remains to be seen if New Delhi will support tougher sanctions if the U.S. decides to go that route. As India's economy grows, so will its capability to be one of the U.S.' great partners. But as its international position strengthens, New Delhi's interests may not always be aligned with Washington's. Obama must work to convince India that the U.S. sees it as an important ally and that its rise to power is in the U.S.' strategic interest. The symbolism of giving Singh the administration's first state visit will be a good start.","Visit by Indian PM reflects India's growing political, economic importance to the U.S.

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- A Newsweek journalist accused of making false accusations against the Iranian government in the wake of the disputed presidential election in June was released from prison Saturday, Iranian media reported. Various organizations and individuals signed petitions asking for release of journalist Bahari, Newsweek says. Maziar Bahari, an Iranian-Canadian correspondent based in Tehran, was among the more than 100 journalists, reformist leaders and former government ministers who went on trial in August in Iran's Revolutionary Court. Bahari was released from Evin prison on nearly $300,000 bail after spending four months behind bars, a revolutionary court spokesman told the news agency. The conditions of his release were not disclosed. Newsweek, which has firmly rejected the allegations against Bahari, reported Saturday that authorities did not specify why the journalist was released. Bahari, 42, is expecting his first child October 26, and ""the mother has experienced serious health complications,"" Newsweek said in an article on its Web site. ""Humanitarian considerations were presumed to have played a role in the decision,"" the article said. ""We are relieved that Newsweek journalist Maziar Bahari is home with his family today. We would like to thank all of those who supported Maziar through this long and uncertain period,"" the magazine said in a statement. Newsweek said various organizations and individuals signed petitions asking for his release. Bahari's case was among those raised at recent talks between the United States and Iran in Geneva. The government of Iran arrested more than 1,000 people in a massive crackdown following the June 12 election. Iran's election commission declared President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad the overwhelming winner of the race, prompting hundreds of thousands of Iranians to fill the streets of Tehran in protest, contending the election was fraudulent. Bahari was accused of propagandizing against Iran, favoring opposition groups; sending false reports through the foreign media; and disturbing the peace by participating in the post-election demonstrations, according to Fars. The Iranian Labour News Agency said the reporter also was accused of possessing classified documents. According to Fars, Bahari confessed after his arrest at a news conference. CNN was unable to confirm the agency report. Human rights groups have accused prison guards of coercing false confessions among other forms of detainee mistreatment.","Maziar Bahari was accused of making false accusations against Iranian government .

"Guangzhou, China (CNN) -- In a new book, the half brother of President Obama claims the father they shared was often drunk and physically abusive. ""My father beat me,"" Mark Obama Ndesandjo told reporters in China, where he lives. ""He beat my mother. You just do not do that. I shut these thoughts in the back of my mind for many years."" Ndesandjo, who took the last name of the man his mother remarried, has dodged the media in the year since his half brother was elected U.S. president. However, he spoke out Wednesday regarding his semi-autobiographical book, ""Nairobi to Shenzhen."" An engineer by trade, Ndesandjo moved to Shenzhen, China, after losing his job in the United States seven years ago. He owns a small chain of restaurants in Shenzhen and teaches piano to orphans. Watch as the president's half brother instructs kids on the piano . He said that he struggled with the name Obama for years, telling few about his family. But he said something happened to change that after he watched Obama's victory celebration in Chicago, Illinois' Grant Park following the 2008 election. His own despair turned into hope, he said. ""I saw millions of people who loved or supported my brother Barack, and in the process, in some weird way, I came to terms with many things that I had shut out of my life, including the Obama name,"" he said. In his book, ""Dreams of My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance,"" Obama writes that he grew up in Hawaii, raised by his mother and her parents, after his father, Barack Obama Sr., returned to Africa. He recalls a monthlong visit with his father when he was 10 and going to Kenya after the elder Obama's death. In the book, Obama acknowledges his father was an alcoholic. There was no immediate reaction from the White House to Ndesandjo's comments. Ndesandjo said he has met with Obama infrequently over the years but said he would like to introduce his half brother to his Chinese wife when Obama makes his first official visit to China this month. Presidential brothers, such as Billy Carter and Roger Clinton Jr., historically have not had an easy ride. However, Ndesandjo said he wants to live his life and tell his own story, not have others tell it for him. CNN's John Vause contributed to this report.","Mark Obama Ndesandjo is President Obama's half brother .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Police in Connecticut say they have arrested a woman suspected of robbing at least six banks in the past week. Police released photos of a suspect in the robberies of six New England banks. Detectives from the Major Crimes division of the Connecticut State Police took Heather Brown into custody at about 3:15 p.m. The 34-year-old resident of Norwich, Connecticut, will be formally charged with robbery in the first degree, police said. Investigators believe Brown robbed the banks, often while claiming to have a bomb. ""When she goes into the banks, she gives the teller information through a note or verbally that she has a bomb,"" said Sgt. Jim Keeney of the Connecticut State Police. ""However, there haven't been any reports of an actual bomb."" Authorities say they believe the woman has held up banks in the Connecticut towns of Middletown, Montville, East Hartford and Windsor, as well as banks in West Springfield, Massachusetts and Westerly, Rhode Island. Women commit 6.2 percent of bank robberies nationwide, up from 4.9 percent in 2002, according to recent FBI figures. The one-woman crime wave in New England apparently began September 21 at the Citizens Bank in Montville, Connecticut. State police said ""a lone white female ... entered the bank with a bag in her possession. The suspect approached the teller indicated she was in possession of a bomb and demanded cash."" The woman left the bag on a counter and bolted, police said. Four days later, a woman entered a branch of the New Alliance Bank in East Hartford, Connecticut. Investigators with the East Hartford Police Department said she ""left a note indicating that she had a bomb and demanded $1,000. She fled the bank with an undisclosed amount of money.""

"Fort Hood, Texas (CNN) -- Pvt. Joseph Foster was filling out routine paperwork for his upcoming deployment to Afghanistan on Thursday when he heard a shout quickly followed by a burst of gunfire from just a few feet away. ""I was sitting in about the second row back when the assailant stood up and yelled 'Allahu akbar' in Arabic and he opened fire,"" Foster said Monday on CNN's ""American Morning."" Foster, 21, did not forget his basic training, which may have saved his life and the lives of others. ""[I] got down on the floor, moved to cover. One soldier had peeked his head around the cubicle I was hiding in ... and I pulled him in,"" Foster said. Foster realized he had been shot in the hip but was too consumed by adrenaline to think about his injury. ""Another soldier had come in as soon as the assailant had moved away from us,"" he said. ""Those two got up and got out, and I got out shortly behind him."" Once outside, Foster said, he hid behind a military shipping container ""and started doing what I was trained to do."" ""[I] started helping get people into the next building and get them under cover,"" he said. Despite his injury, Foster, who has a wife and two young children, said he still plans to deploy to Afghanistan in January. ""I'm still a soldier day in and day out,"" he said. ""I'll do my job."" Authorities are trying to figure out what prompted the gunman to begin shooting at Fort Hood Army Post, killing 13 people and wounding 42. Fifteen soldiers are still hospitalized, including eight patients in intensive care, Fort Hood commander Lt. Gen. Robert Cone said Monday. Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, a 39-year-old licensed Army psychiatrist who worked at a hospital on the post, is the suspected shooter. He was shot several times, ending the attack, and is now conscious and talking, a spokesman at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio said Monday. It is unclear if Army investigators have spoken to Hasan. The intense investigation into the mass shooting remains largely shrouded in silence. Army officials have voiced concern about jumping to any conclusions about the motive, warning about a possible backlash against Muslim soldiers. Several bystanders, like Foster, reported Hasan shouted ""Allahu akbar,"" Arabic for ""God is great,"" which terrorists have used as a battle cry. The Army leadership at Fort Hood will ""take a very hard look at ourselves and look at anything that might have been done to have prevented this,"" Cone said Monday. ""Hasan was a soldier, and we have other soldiers ... that might have some of the same stress and indicators that he has,"" Cone said. ""We have to look across our entire formation, not just in a medical community, but really look hard to our right and left. That's the responsibility for everybody, from the top to the bottom, to make sure we're taking care of our own."" Cone said Monday that he has instructed commanders at Fort Hood to ""immediately take a hard look and make sure if there's anybody out there struggling [that] we're going to address their issues."" Sen. Joe Lieberman said he plans a Senate committee hearing into whether the shootings were a terrorist act and whether the Army should responded to reported signs of Islamic extremism by the suspected gunman. If Hasan was showing signs of being an Islamic extremist, the Army should have acted on that earlier, and ""he should have been gone,"" said Lieberman, a Connecticut independent and chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. He spoke on ""Fox News Sunday."" The shooting, on the nation's largest military base, sparked outrage. In his Saturday radio address, President Obama said it was ""an act of violence that would have been heartbreaking had it occurred any place in America."" But, he said, ""it's all the more heartbreaking and all the more despicable because of the place where it occurred and the patriots who were its victims."" All but one of those who were killed were soldiers. Obama and first lady Michelle Obama will attend a Tuesday memorial service for the victims. Defense Secretary Robert Gates will also participate in the memorial service, but he will not speak, Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said. Gates on Monday night will go to Fort Hood, where he will meet with the victims' families as well as Fort Hood Police Sgt. Kimberly Munley, the civilian officer who confronted and disabled Hasan as they shot at each other. Gates will also meet with military officials at the Army base, including Fort Hood's commanding general, Lt. Gen. Robert Cone, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Mike Mullen, according to Morrell. CNN's David Mattingly and Victor Hernandez contributed to this report.","Pvt. Joseph Foster was doing paperwork when he heard a shout, then gunfire .

"(CNN) -- Within weeks of British student Meredith Kercher's death in the vibrant college town of Perugia, Italy, prosecutors and police declared the case closed. They'd seized two knives in their search for the murder weapon. They took DNA from the room where Kercher was killed. And at least one suspect had confessed to being at the murder scene. Or so they said. Kercher had been stabbed in a sexual misadventure, officials said. And they knew the killers. American Amanda Knox, Kercher's roommate; Italian Raffaele Sollecito, Knox's boyfriend; and Ivory Coast native Rudy Guede, a drifter known in the area, had their pictures splattered across the world's media. Knox's photo was even hung in the police plaza alongside Italy's most infamous mobsters and criminals. The prosecution case seemed a sensational slam-dunk, almost too good to be true. Knox's supporters say that's because it is. ""In the beginning, all of this supposed evidence was being leaked, showing what sounded like a pretty convincing case,"" Anne Bremner, a lawyer and former prosecutor working with the group Friends of Amanda, told CNN. The case couldn't look more different depending on where you stand. Knox's murder trial is entering its final stages, with closing arguments beginning November 20. The jury will begin deliberating December 4. But there is still no agreement on the key pieces of evidence that prosecutors say convict her and the defense says clear her. Behind the Scenes: How we examined the evidence . In Knox's corner: her friends and family from Seattle, Washington. For them, she is the victim - railroaded by an overzealous Italian prosecutor, who faces charges of prosecutorial misconduct in another case. Knox's supporters say he's tried to force the evidence to fit his theory of what happened. And with negative and often false details about the case appearing in the press - all for the jury to read - Knox supporters fear she could be convicted regardless of the facts. On the other side: Perugia's prosecutor Giuliano Mignini. For him and his colleagues, the answer is simple - Guede, Knox and Sollecito are all responsible for leaving Kercher partially clothed, strangled and with her throat cut on November 2, 2007. See a timeline of the case . The knife . The crime scene was gruesome. The 21-year old British student was found under a duvet on the floor by her bed, covered in blood. A bloody handprint was streaked on the wall above her. A source close to the prosecution says Kercher was held down while she was strangled and stabbed. The source says Sollecito's 6 ½-inch kitchen knife was used to slit her throat and then taken back to his apartment. It is perhaps the biggest piece of evidence the prosecution has presented against Knox. Knox's DNA is on the handle and that of Kercher is on the blade, said a source close to the prosecution who did not wish to be identified discussing an ongoing case. Kercher had never been to Sollecito's apartment and wouldn't have come in contact with the knife, he said, yet there was her DNA. Those ""unmistakable facts"" show the knife played a role in the murder, the source said. Bremner and experts testifying for the defense say there is no way the knife could be the murder weapon. Dr. Carlo Torre, a leading forensics expert in Italy, testified that the knife taken from Sollecito's apartment wouldn't have made the wounds on Kercher's body. ""It doesn't match the size or shape [of the wounds,]"" Bremner told CNN. ""And Sollecito's knife also doesn't match a bloody outline of a knife left on the bedding."" Bremner, who offered her legal advice pro bono to the Knox family, questioned the validity of the DNA evidence, saying the knife had been ""improperly transported in a shoe box."" Watch Amanda Knox's parents discuss the case . Furthermore, Bremner said the jury heard from defense expert Sarah Gino, a geneticist and private coroner in Italy, who said that the DNA sample was too small to be definitive. Bremner said the presence of Knox's DNA on the knife handle was no surprise, as the couple had dinner at his house occasionally. Prosecutors say just because the knife doesn't match everything doesn't mean it wasn't used. The source close to the prosecution said it was possible, based on the wounds, that several different items made them. Damning DNA or 'Fellini Forensics' On the night Kercher was killed, Knox and her boyfriend say they were at his house watching a movie and smoking hashish. Their recollection of events, they admitted, was hazy from the drugs, but both swore they went back to the house the next morning. Knox says she was unable to gain entry - and called police. For their case, prosecutors had to prove that Knox and Sollecito - who had recently started dating - were lying and place them at the home when Kercher was killed. Some reports spoke of a scurry of people - more than one - on the night of the murder around the house. It was a positive lead for prosecutor Mignini - but came to nothing in court. But the prosecution had more evidence in the form of a bra clasp, one that fell to the floor after the murderer cut Kercher's bra in half before she was killed. And on it was Sollecito's DNA. Bremner says that evidence on the clasp is fundamentally flawed, like much from the crime scene collection, calling the work ""Fellini forensics."" ""In the [crime scene] video, you can see it went from being white in color to nearly black because it got so dirty being moved around,"" Bremner said of the clasp, noting that tainted the only evidence that placed Sollecito at the scene. Bremner described other errors she saw on the crime scene video. ""They were putting their fingers in Kercher's wound, they were shaking out evidence, picking up hairs and dropping them,"" she said. ""Some people didn't wear gloves or had their hair draping on the floor, they crashed into a window at one point and threw aside evidence. It was just wrong on all levels."" The prosecution source maintains the crime scene was handled properly, and the evidence shows what it shows. The source says it's up to the defense to prove otherwise. Biggest case for Italy or the 'greatest travesty' ever? Knox's introduction to the world came in a whirlwind of tabloid headlines. The prosecution touted hard evidence early that they said unquestionably showed they had their killers. There was a footprint in Knox and Kercher's bathroom that was attributed to Sollecito - though later analysts admitted it belonged to Guede, who was convicted of Kercher's murder in 2008. The prosecution also presented what they called a confession by Knox, but Knox later said any apparent admission she was at the scene was made when investigators told her to imagine what she might have seen if she had been there. The argument became moot when a higher court ruled the alleged confession could not be used because the statement was made without an attorney or translator present. The tabloid headlines continue as the trial closes. Media around the world focus on Knox's sexual history, what clothes she wears to court and whether a bump on her lip means the girl they dubbed ""Foxy Knoxy"" has herpes. It's all a distraction from the lack of evidence, Bremner said. ""It's the greatest travesty of a prosecution ever,"" Bremner said. ""It's so ludicrous. You've got to have a theory, or a motive, but the theory has to fit the facts somehow. And in this case, there's no solid evidence, no motive and no match whatsoever."" Knox's supporters maintain that the prosecution did get one thing right - putting Guede behind bars. He chose a fast-track trial, separate from Sollecito and Knox, and was convicted of murder and attempted sexual assault and sentenced to 30 years. They believe he was Kercher's sole killer. He is appealing the verdict. They believe Knox and Sollecito are only being prosecuted because they were flaunted so publicly as the killers, and it would look bad for officials to admit they got it wrong. The prosecution source rejects that, and portrays Knox, Sollecito and Guede as three people who together ended the life of the young British woman. And they say the way Knox originally pointed the finger at another man - who was cleared with an alibi - shows she had something to hide. Both sides agree the truth is in the evidence, and it will soon be for the jury to decide which version they believe.

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The British journalist recently freed in a NATO military operation described his Taliban hostage-takers as ""hopelessly inept,"" and praised his Afghan colleague who died in the rescue. Journalists carry flowers to the grave of Afghan journalist Sultan Munadi in Kabul on Thursday. New York Times reporter Stephen Farrell described his four days in captivity in a blog on the newspaper's Web site, posted late Wednesday just hours after he was freed. Taliban militants kidnapped Farrell and Afghan journalist, Sultan Munadi, on Saturday. During a pre-dawn raid Wednesday, NATO's International Security Assistance Force plucked Farrell to safety, but did not retrieve the body of Munadi, who died during a fierce firefight between troops and Taliban militants. A British commando was also killed, as were a woman and child. There has been criticism about the rescue operation as well as the initial decision to go into the region which Farrell points out in his blog, ""was becoming more troubled by insurgents."" International troops, including British forces, have expressed their unhappiness about having to extract a Western journalist from the area, a Western military source in Kabul told CNN. Meanwhile, NATO has come under fire from a coalition of Afghan journalists working for foreign news outlets who called the pre-dawn raid ""reckless and double-standard behavior."" The Media Club of Afghanistan issued a statement Thursday saying it ""holds the international forces responsible for the death of Mr. Munadi because they resorted in military action before exhausting other nonviolent means."" ""There is no justification for the international forces to rescue their own national, and retrieve the dead body of their own soldier killed in action, but leave behind the dead body of Sultan Munadi in the area. The MCA deems this action as inhumane."" British Prime Minister Gordon Brown intends to send a ""private"" letter of condolences to Munadi's family, a spokeswoman for his office told CNN. In his first-hand account of the kidnapping, Farrell praised Munadi for ""trying to protect me up to the last minute."" The two had gone from Kabul to the northern Afghan city of Kunduz on Friday to investigate reports of a NATO airstrike in a Taliban-controlled area. Farrell said he and his colleagues believed the attack, which destroyed two tankers, would be ""a major controversy involving allegations of civilian deaths against NATO claims that the dead were Taliban."" He said they took precautions, including waiting until the next day to drive along the main highway in daylight. While they were interviewing locals about what happened along the riverbank, Farrell said ""a crowd began to gather, time passed, and we grew nervous."" ""I do not know how long we were there, but it was uncomfortably long,"" he said. ""I am comfortable with the decision to go to the riverbank, but fear we spent too long there."" All of a sudden, some of the villagers shouted, ""Taliban"" and their driver fled with the keys, he said. Farrell and Munadi tried to escape too, but they were captured. Munadi was struck with a Kalashnikov rifle, but Farrell said apart from that incident, the two were not ""subjected to any beatings, torture or ill-treatment over the next four days."" Their Taliban captors operated freely in the area southwest of Kunduz, and appeared to be the only armed presence, Farrell wrote. ""It became a tour of a Taliban-controlled district of Afghanistan, and that control appeared total,"" he said. ""At no point did we see a single NATO soldier, Afghan policeman, soldier or any check to the Taliban's ability to move at will."" Farrell said he and Munadi were ""paraded"" around by their captors. ""We were paraded to the children in the street: the infidel and his translator, to be laughed at and mocked,"" he wrote. The captors operated with relative impunity and, at times, ""their operational security was hopelessly inept"" -- using Farrell's name over their mobile phones ""heedless of who was, almost certainly, monitoring the calls."" They even played songs on the radio that praised the Taliban, he said. ""They were not making it hard,"" Farrell wrote. At one point, he said they drove near what they said were watchtowers, manned by the Afghan government and NATO, ""gleeful at their daring."" ""They drove with headlights full on at night as they moved us from house to house, at least three different buildings a day,"" according to Farrell. He said the Taliban captors seemed to be welcomed by some Afghan villagers, while others appeared ""more wary and formally polite."" During their captivity, Farrell said ""there were good hours, and bad ones,"" as well as ""progress and setbacks."" It became harder for the captors to find safe houses, he said. On the third night, there was what appeared to be an attempt to free them, but their captors took them to another refuge within minutes. Then, on the next night, the aerial activity increased and their Taliban captors grabbed their weapons and headed outside -- leaving Farrell and Munadi behind. They ran out later, Munadi in front, and then became separated. Then, Munadi appeared again, holding out his hand to steady a faltering Farrell and they ran across a narrow ledge on the outer wall of the compound. ""I could hear Taliban voices shouting and shooting from trees to our left, I thought,"" Farrell wrote. ""I could also hear indistinct voices ahead. We continued 20 yards along the wall until it suddenly reached the corner."" Munadi walked beyond that corner, out into the open, raising his hands and shouting, ""Journalist."" ""There was a burst of gunfire and he went down immediately,"" Farrell wrote. ""In the dark, with firing all around, trees everywhere and my view obscured by him and the wall, I did not know whether the bullets came from in front, to his right or to his left."" At the sound of gunfire, Farrell reared back and dived into a wet ditch. After a few minutes, he heard British-accented voices and then screamed, ""British hostage,"" flashing a camera light from the ditch. He said he told the soldiers that Munadi was lying behind him, and had possibly been shot. ""The body was lying motionless in the ditch where I had seen him go down,"" Farrell said. ""I hoped he had dropped and was lying still. I knew it wasn't the case."" The soldiers told him that ""they had his picture and would look for him, then dragged me away."" ""It was over,"" he wrote. ""Sultan was dead. He had died trying to help me, right up to the very last seconds of his life."" Farrell said he was then taken onboard the aircraft, as the soldiers, most of them British, carried on some celebrations. But they fell silent after learning one of the rescuers died from the wounds sustained in the raid. ""His blood-soaked helmet was in front of me throughout the flight,"" Farrell wrote. ""I thanked everyone who was still alive to thank. It wasn't, and never will be, enough.""

"(CNN) -- When the Connecticut Huskies take to the field to play West Virginia on Saturday, their helmets will carry the initials of cornerback Jasper Howard, who was stabbed to death over the weekend. The incident happened at 12:33 a.m., shortly after a sponsored student dance on campus. ""It'll be good to get on the practice field tomorrow,"" UConn head football coach Randy Edsall told reporters Monday. Asked whether the team considered postponing the game, he said, ""I know Jasper wouldn't want us to do that. I just know that."" Howard, a 20-year-old cornerback who started in every game for the team last season, was killed in a fight after a student dance on campus Saturday night, authorities said. Edsall said two other UConn players were with Howard at the time of the incident, but declined to identify them. On Monday, the Connecticut Office of the Chief Medical Examiner said Howard died of a stab wound to the abdomen. The death has been classified as a homicide, said Bill Farrell, an investigator in the medical examiner's office. During the dance at the university's student center, a fire alarm was pulled at 12:26 a.m., campus police Maj. Ron Blicher told reporters. More than 300 people who were attending the dance left the building and spilled out into the street. A fight broke out between two groups, and Howard and another person were stabbed, police said.  Watch family, friends react to loss » . The incident happened at 12:33 a.m. Howard and the other victim were taken to a local hospital. Howard was then airlifted by helicopter to St. Francis Hospital in Hartford, where he later died, police said. The second victim, who was treated and released, was 19-year-old Brian Parker, a redshirt freshman on the UConn football squad, according to CNN affiliate WTNH. Johnny F. Hood, 21, was arrested in connection to the fight -- not for the stabbing -- and charged with interfering with an officer and breach of peace, according to a police report. He was released on $100,000 bond. Hood's attorney said his client was simply at the wrong place at the wrong time, WTNH reported Monday. UConn police and the Connecticut State Police are investigating the incident. They don't have a suspect in the stabbing, but they ""don't believe it was a random act,"" Blicher said. Both students and nonstudents were in the area at the time. Authorities are investigating whether alcohol was involved and what the altercation was about, he said. Anyone with information is asked to contact UConn police. Howard, a father-to-be, was a cornerback for the Huskies, who are 4-2 this season. The team's Web site says he started in every game last year and led the Big East conference in punt returns. On Saturday, the Huskies beat Louisville 38-25. Howard was awarded the game ball after the game, Edsall said. Howard's mother, Joangela, said her son called her after the game, which she watched from her Miami home. Just hours after that chat, she received another call from Edsall, who told her Howard had been stabbed. ""He was a good child, a wonderful, sweet, loving child,"" Joangela Howard told CNN affiliate WSVN. ""I just hope whoever did it turns himself in. [Jasper] didn't deserve this."" Edsall said Howard's family would be arriving in Connecticut Monday afternoon. CNN's Gabriel Falcon contributed to this report.","Jasper Howard, 20, killed after a sponsored student dance on campus .

But behind that tough exterior were secrets of a difficult past. ""As a teen, I was both anorexic and bulimic,"" Alanis Morissette recently told Health magazine for its December issue. ""I was a young woman in the public eye, on the receiving end of a lot of attention, and I was trying to protect myself from men who were using their power in ways I was too young to know how to handle."" By the time Morissette was 14, she had already starred in a popular Canadian children's show, started her own record label and had a publishing contract with MCA Canada, according to her Web site. ""Disappointment, sadness and pain hit me hard, and I tried to numb those feelings through my relationship with food. For four to six months at a time, I would barely eat. I lived on a diet of Melba toast, carrots, and black coffee,"" she said. ""I began recovering at 18, when a sweet friend confronted me."" Now that she's older, Morissette, 35, said she's no longer starving herself and has begun to look at eating as ""a sort of spiritual practice."" Her healthier view of food and nutrition is thanks in no small part to a book she discovered a few years ago called ""Eat to Live."" ""It's become my bible, pushing me to completely reorient my thinking about what to put into my body. ... Now I concentrate on eating high-nutrient foods like fruit, nuts, collards, kale and spinach. I'm obsessed with them. I even put spinach in my smoothies,"" the Canadian musician admitted. The seven-time Grammy Award winner has also sworn off dairy, on a tip from Woody Harrelson, no less. ""Woody Harrelson [told] me I needed to get rid of the dairy in my fridge to clear up my skin,"" she said. It's had a positive effect: Morissette said her skin ""looks great now."" But all of that health consciousness doesn't mean Morissette has lost appreciation for the more delectable things in life. ""Don't get me wrong,"" she said in the interview, ""I still indulge in a glass of wine or chocolate -- treats are mandatory. Without deviating from the day-to-day healthy diet once in a while, it wouldn't be sustainable for me, and that's what I wanted: an approach to eating to last my entire life."" Resolving her issues with food and body image has helped Morissette to develop clarity in other areas of her life as well. ""I'm really clear about what my life mission is now. There's no more depression or lethargy, and I feel like I've returned to the athlete I once was. I'm integrating all the parts of me -- jock, musician, writer, poet, philosopher -- and becoming stronger as a result,"" she said. ""I hope my effort shows any woman battling an eating disorder or poor body image that she's not alone -- support is out there -- and inspires her to discover her inner athlete. It doesn't matter what your fitness-skill level is."" Health magazine's December issue hits newsstands November 24.","Alanis Morissette told Health magazine that she had an eating disorder as a teen .

"ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN)  -- The governments of Armenia and Turkey will sign a peace agreement in Zurich on Saturday that would normalize relations after nearly a century of animosity between the neighboring nations, the Swiss government said Friday. The Swiss-mediated peace deal would also open the border between the countries, which has been shut since 1993. The signing ceremony comes more than a month after Armenia and Turkey announced they had agreed to start six weeks of ""internal political consultations"" on two protocols aimed at establishing diplomatic and bilateral relations. The Swiss-mediated peace deal would also open the border between the countries, which has been shut since 1993. The border was closed after Turkey objected to Armenia's war with Turkish ally Azerbaijan over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabagh. Neither country has an embassy in the other's capital. Turkish-Armenian relations have often been overshadowed by the dispute over the massacre of ethnic Armenians in the final days of the Ottoman Empire, more than 90 years ago. Armenians accuse Ottoman Turks of committing genocide, killing more then a million Armenians starting in 1915. Modern-day Turkey vehemently rejects the allegations. The proposed protocols for normalizing relations call for creating a committee of international experts to research archives and ""restore mutual confidence between the two nations."" There is no mention of the disputed territory of Karabagh, which Armenian troops have controlled since the 1993 Armenian-Azerbaijan war. But the success of the protocols is still uncertain, as the parliaments of both countries still must ratify the agreement. A senior U.S. State Department official -- authorized to brief reporters without attribution because of diplomatic sensitivities -- said the situation remains ""difficult."" ""There's opposition both in Turkey and in Armenia,"" the senior official said Thursday, ""but both governments realize ultimately it's in their interest to have normalized relations and an open border after years of tension and the economic isolation, particularly of Armenia."" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will attend the signing, along with dignitaries from several other countries, including the European Union, according to the Swiss government.","Swiss-mediated deal would normalize relations between rival nations .

"Brussels, Belgium (CNN) -- European Union leaders named Belgian Prime Minister Herman Van Rompuy as the first ""president of Europe"" Thursday, edging out former British Prime Minister Tony Blair for a still-vaguely defined job. ""I did not seek this high position, and I didn't take any steps to achieve it,"" Van Rompuy said in accepting the job. ""But tonight, I take on this task with conviction and with enthusiasm."" Van Rompuy, a 62-year-old, soft-spoken fan of Japanese poetry, will become the face of European Union and represent its 27 member nations at summits overseas. His conservative government took office in December 2008. The Belgian is ""well known as a consensus builder,"" said British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who added the selection was unanimous. And Jose Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission -- the executive arm of the EU -- called Van Rompuy's selection ""a tribute to Belgium,"" the EU's host country. "" I think the European Union also expressed its gratitude for the work of Belgium and the constant support that this country at the heart of Europe has given to our common project,"" he said. In his speech, Van Rompuy pledged to lead the EU through a process of ""dialogue, unity and action."" ""A negotiation that ends with a defeated party is never a good negotiation,"" he said. ""As president of the council, I will listen carefully to everyone, and I will make sure that all deliberations turn into results for everyone."" The presidency was created by the European Union's Lisbon Treaty, which came into force this month after years of torturous negotiations. Van Rompuy will serve a two-and-a-half-year term, replacing the six-month presidency of the bloc that rotated among the heads of its member states. But while the EU prides itself on being a club of democracies, the process of choosing its new leader was far from transparent or open. The people of Europe are getting no say, not even through their parliamentarians. Van Rompuy's new job was announced after a closed-door dinner for the EU's heads of state and government. The Belgian defended the process, telling reporters the selection was made by leaders ""who were all democratically chosen."" ""I was chosen on the basis of a treaty,"" he said. ""The treaty stipulates the procedure. The treaty was democratically approved by 27 member states."" The EU leaders also named Catherine Ashton, a British trade commissioner and member of the House of Lords, as the union's High Commissioner -- its equivalent of a foreign minister. Unlike Van Rompuy, who was chosen by leaders of the EU's member states, Ashton must be confirmed by the European Parliament. Blair, who led Britain from 1997 to 2007, is currently the EU's Mideast envoy. He had been the early favorite for the presidency in recent weeks -- but Brown, his successor, realized that he lacked support among key decision-makers for new post, a Brown representative told CNN earlier. According his backers, who at first included French President Nicolas Sarkozy, he was just the sort of world-renowned figure to win attention for the EU and enable it to exercise its weight in world affairs. One Indian official told CNN before the announcement, ""If the EU chooses as its worldwide representative the prime minister of Belgium or Luxembourg, I am not sure our leaders will have the time to meet him."" But others were soon arguing that Blair's support for the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq and his close alliance with former U.S. President George W. Bush made him a divisive figure in Europe. And as the one man who might have been able to take Britain into the European single currency, he had not even attempted to do so while he was Britain's prime minister. Public backing from Italy's Silvio Berlusconi, a joke figure to much of Europe and another Bush ally, did not help. Brown had realized earlier that Blair did not have enough support among key decision-makers to snag the new post, a Brown representative told CNN earlier.

"Vilseck, Germany (CNN)  -- The wives of three Army sergeants in prison for premeditated murder say their husbands are war heroes who should not be in prison. ""I can sympathize with them that they felt like there was nothing else they could do,"" said Jamie Leahy, wife of Sgt. Michael Leahy, a 28-year-old medic. She said her husband and the other two sergeants were heroes for protecting other soldiers. Leahy, 1st Sgt. John Hatley and Sgt. 1st Class Joseph Mayo killed four Iraqi men whom they had taken into custody at a canal in Baghdad, Iraq. During the investigation of the killings, Leahy told Army investigators that the same men they had captured would be shooting at them again if they had released them. ""It's like somebody keeps coming and breaking into your house, and you told the cops, 'This is who it is, I saw them, they were in my house,' "" Jamie Leahy told CNN's ""AC 360°.""  ""And that's not enough, and they are able to keep coming in and breaking into your house. ""I know it's more severe than that, but I mean if somebody kept coming in and breaking into your house, I think that the person would either want to get a gun or something to protect themselves because you feel like in your own home, you can't even be safe."" Earlier this year, Leahy, Hatley and Mayo were convicted of premeditated murder and conspiracy to commit premeditated murder in the killings of the four Iraqi detainees in March 2007. Documents obtained by CNN, as well as Army interrogation tapes, reveal that Hatley believed that if the men were taken to a detainee holding area, they would be released because there was not enough evidence to hold them. ""It's like you're letting somebody go so they can come back and terrorize you again and try and kill you and maybe be successful next time,"" Jaime Leahy said. Kim Hatley made a video in a field in Schweinfurt, Germany, where she and her husband lived before he was sent to the U.S. military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. In the video, she holds up cards asking for help in freeing ""three American heroes."" ""They served their country, and they've been through a lot, and so have the family members,"" she told CNN. ""But, in life, with any challenge, you can't just look at one incident. This does not define who these soldiers are."" Kim Hatley says her husband is a ""good man."" ""I don't think my husband should have gone to prison,"" she said. ""I don't think that was fair. I don't think any of our soldiers should have gone to prison."" And Johana Mayo said her husband has been punished enough. ""I think that he's given and sacrificed a lot,"" she said. ""I think he's a war hero. He's not a criminal and he's ... being treated as a criminal, and he shouldn't be."" The Mayos have three children, ages 15 months, 6 and 11. Johana Mayo is legally blind and cannot drive. ""I was used to relying on my husband for everything,"" she said. ""You know, and he was the one that drove the kids around. He was the one that took care of their homework and anything -- grocery shopping -- everything. I relied on him for everything, and now I feel like I have to turn to my daughter a lot, and she's only 11."" All three wives have set up Web sites to support their husbands: defendjohnhatley.com, defendjosephmayo.com and supportsgtleahy.com. Hatley, who was sentenced to life imprisonment, got clemency with his sentence reduced to 40 years. Both Leahy, who also received a life sentence, and Mayo, who got 35 years, had their sentences reduced to 20 years. All three sergeants were reduced in rank to private and sent to Fort Leavenworth. ""I think that what happened was done to protect the soldiers, to keep our soldiers safe from getting harmed or killed,"" Johana Mayo said.","Wives say three Army sergeants convicted of murder should not be in prison .

"(CNN) -- Elizabeth McCutchen and a friend were walking to book club two weeks ago in quaint Farmville, Virginia, when they strolled by a home on First Avenue. ""Something smells dead,"" her friend said. Richard Samuel McCroskey has been arrested in connection with the killings of four people in Virginia. They were thinking animal. A dog, a cat, something like that. They never imagined they were smelling the remains of massacred humans. It was Thursday, September 17. But another 24 hours would pass before police made the gruesome discovery. Richard Samuel McCroskey III -- a 20-year-old rapper in the underground genre of ""Horrorcore"" who sang of chopping people into pieces -- has been arrested in connection with the slayings. The crime scene was so horrifying police would not even describe it, saying only that the victims died of blunt force trauma. The victims were Mark Niederbrock, 50, the beloved pastor at Walker's Presbyterian Church; his 16-year-old daughter, Emma Niederbrock; Melanie Wells, Emma's 18-year-old friend from West Virginia; and Niederbrock's estranged wife, Debra Kelley, 53, a professor at Longwood University. McCroskey has been charged only in the killing of Mark Niederbrock. Police and the prosecutor's office did not return repeated phone calls from CNN. But in late September, authorities said more charges are pending. Emma was described as a fan of Horrorcore and had met McCroskey through their mutual affection for the little-known music genre. Police said she invited McCroskey to fly from his northern California home, stay with her in Virginia and then attend the Strictly for the Wicked Festival, a Horrorcore fest in Michigan featuring bands with names like Dismembered Fetus and Phrozen Body Boy. Nobody saw what would come next. The slayings have been the talk of Farmville, a town of  7,000 that is home to Longwood University and nearby Hampden-Sydney College. Senseless is the word you hear most. It's not just the macabre nature of the killings that has people talking. It's the grotesque lyrics of the Horrorcore singer; it's that it happened under their noses. McCroskey is a young man with no criminal record who took delight in the blend of horror hip-hop that celebrated macabre killings. He went by the name Syko Sam. In one YouTube video, he holds a hatchet and sings about killing people and putting their remains in black bags: ""Last night I was the murderous rage. Now, I gotta get rid of the bodies before the corpses start to get to rotting."" 'Stinkiest rascal I've ever smelled' Authorities have not specified when the Virginia killings occurred, but at 4 a.m. on Friday, September 18, tow-truck driver Elton Napier was called out to Poor House Road to help McCroskey, whose car was stuck. Napier said McCroskey was wearing a black-hooded sweatshirt and ""was really smelling bad, like real bad. I can't describe it."" McCroskey was driving Mark Niederbrock's Honda. Napier said two sheriff's deputies were at the scene and McCroskey was ticketed for driving without a license. At the time, authorities didn't know the pastor had been slain. When McCroskey hopped into Napier's flatbed, the tow-truck driver said he started gagging from the odor and immediately rolled down the windows. ""I just held my head out the window so the wind would hit me in the face,"" he said. ""That was the stinkiest rascal I've ever smelled."" Napier drove McCroskey about four miles to a convenience store. McCroskey told Napier he was visiting his girlfriend and her father lent him the car. McCroskey fetched a black bag from the Honda before they parted. Napier went inside to get a cup of coffee. According to police, McCroskey eventually caught a cab to Richmond International Airport. By mid-afternoon that same day, police found the bodies at the home on First Avenue. McCroskey was arrested the next day at the airport, where he had spent the night. When he was being led to jail, McCroskey told reporters, ""Jesus told me to do it."" Suspect's family, community grieve . Sarah McCroskey of California told CNN-affiliate WWBT that her brother had been looking forward to his visit to Virginia for weeks. She mourned his arrest and struggled with the accusations against him. ""I want to hear his voice. I am so concerned, so worried -- not just for him [but] other people, other families involved dealing with this loss,"" she said. Read WWBT's special coverage . Defense attorney Cary Bowen told CNN, ""I don't want to say he's in shock. That's a medical term, but it's a big experience for him. ... I'm not sure he gets the severity of everything right now."" The community is still devastated by the events as it struggles to move forward. Memorial services were held over the weekend for Emma Niederbrock and her mother, Debra Kelley. The Rev. Sylvia Meadows of Farmville United Methodist Church baptized Emma at age 5 and her father when he was an adult. The pastor said the church has invited an occult specialist to speak with members of the community to help them come to grips with the dark side of humanity. ""We have looked evil in the face and cannot deny that it exists,"" Meadows said. ""God is stronger than evil. God is bigger."" Luther Glenn, a member of Walker's Presbyterian Church where Niederbrock was pastor, took issue with McCroskey's comment about Jesus telling him to act. ""I think it's deeply rooted in Satan, if you want to know the truth."" Elizabeth McCutchen, who passed the First Avenue home some time after the slayings, said the killings have affected every fabric of the community: the churches, the colleges, and their youth. ""This is the kind of town that goes to the rescue of survivors, but there's nobody [left] -- we can't do anything about it,"" she said. ""It's been really, really upsetting.""

"New York (CNN) -- More than 80 Michael Jackson collectibles -- including the late pop star's famous rhinestone-studded glove from a 1983 performance -- were auctioned off Saturday, reaping a total $2 million. Profits from the auction at the Hard Rock Cafe in New York's Times Square crushed pre-sale expectations of only $120,000 in sales. The highly prized memorabilia, which included items spanning the many stages of Jackson's career, came from more than 30 fans, associates and family members, who contacted Julien's Auctions to sell their gifts and mementos of the singer. Jackson's flashy glove was the big-ticket item of the night, fetching $420,000 from a buyer in Hong Kong, China. Jackson wore the glove at a 1983 performance during ""Motown 25,"" an NBC special where he debuted his revolutionary moonwalk. Fellow Motown star Walter ""Clyde"" Orange of the Commodores, who also performed in the special 26 years ago, said he asked for Jackson's autograph at the time, but Jackson gave him the glove instead. ""The legacy that [Jackson] left behind is bigger than life for me,"" Orange said. ""I hope that through that glove people can see what he was trying to say in his music and what he said in his music."" Orange said he plans to give a portion of the proceeds to charity. Hoffman Ma, who bought the glove on behalf of Ponte 16 Resort in Macau, paid a 25 percent buyer's premium, which was tacked onto all final sales over $50,000. Winners of items less than $50,000 paid a 20 percent premium. Darren Julien, president and CEO of Julien's Auctions, said people were hungry for such tokens of Jackson's life, as evidenced by the 3,500 who registered as bidders for the auction. ""Michael was very generous,"" Julien said. ""If you were friends with Michael Jackson or an important part of his life, occasionally he would give something away, and that's a very big reason that these things got out in the public."" A signature black synthetic blend jacket from Jackson's 16-month Bad World Tour, his first concert tour as a solo artist, sold for $270,000. Featuring black straps with silver buckles and zippers, the jacket came to symbolize Jackson's ""Bad"" era. Tori Renza, whose father bought her the Bad jacket when she was just 4 years old, said she grew up singing and dancing to Jackson's songs around her house. ""It just became part of our family,"" said Renza, who planned to use the money from the auction to pay back student loans. Jackson's famed fedora, which he sported at the 1995 MTV Music Awards, sold for $73,800. It was one of three hats Jackson wore during a 10-minute medley before hurling it into the crowd. The hat was auctioned at a charity event that year, and the letter of verification is signed ""Lisa Marie Presley Jackson,"" the daughter of Elvis Presley who was married to Jackson for nearly two years. ""To my knowledge, there were not a lot of letters that she signed with her full name,"" Julien said. Handwritten lyrics of the 1983 smash hit ""Beat It,"" which Jackson scribbled on a piece of white paper, went for $60,000. One of the more bizarre items up for bidding, an upper mold used to fit Jackson with animal fangs for the 1983 video for ""Thriller,"" sold for more than $10,000. The auction also allowed the world to see photographs of Jackson engaged in simple activities, like driving. His 1985 Mercedes-Benz 500 SEL, which he ultimately gave to an aunt as a birthday gift, was auctioned for $104,500. ""What's even more significant is that we have photos of Michael driving the car,"" Julien said. ""When have you seen Michael driving a car? He was always chauffeured or driven."" There were also a number of autographed photos, as well as signed books, collectibles and artwork. Even Jackson's doodles and sketches of the likes of Frankenstein, Mickey Mouse and Charlie Chaplin were up for sale. Lee Tompkins, a renowned pencil artist who said he came to know Jackson in the early 1980s and owns approximately 75 of Jackson's artworks, auctioned two of Jackson's pieces: one of a vagabond and the other of Charlie Chaplin. They sold for $20,000 and $33,280 respectively. ""He's more than just a singer and dancer. He was an artist first,"" Thompkins said. Before Saturday's auction, the items were exhibited in Santiago, Chile; Dublin, Ireland; and Tokyo, Japan, where crowds lined up for hours get a glimpse of them, Julien said. ""Michael Jackson is looking down and has to be happy,"" he said after the auction, adding, ""We lost an icon.""","Among items auctioned Saturday: jacket, song lyrics, sketches, dental mold .

"(CNN)  -- Thousands of fans, many weeping, packed a Hannover, Germany, stadium Sunday to pay their last respects to Robert Enke, captain of the Hannover 96 soccer club, who died last week in what police believe was a suicide. Footage from the event showed Enke's flower-bedecked coffin carried through the stadium to the accompaniment of Bette Midler's song ""The Rose"" as the crowd cheered. Many of the spectators waved Hannover 96 banners as they wiped tears from their eyes. Enke, 32, was the goalkeeper for both Hannover 96 and the German national soccer team. He died Tuesday about 6:25 p.m. after he apparently stepped in front of a train. He had played in eight games for the team and was widely expected to be the German team's goalkeeper in the 2010 World Cup. ""Preliminary police investigations indicate a suicide,"" Hannover 96 spokesman Stefan Wittke said last week. The stadium funeral service followed another memorial in a church and a mourning march through Hannover initiated by fans, the team said in a statement on its Web site. ""Robert's wife Teresa has expressed the wish to have all his friends and fans of her deceased husband bid farewell to him in the AWD Arena,"" the statement said. ""Hannover 96 supports Teresa Enke in her wish to have Robert and his friends, fans and teammates part with one another in an appropriate and worthy setting."" ""A few days have passed since Robert's tragic death, but our inner shock remains,"" the team said. ""One thing is certain: We are not alone in our sadness. Robert Enke was not only perceived by you as a successful football player but above all as a special human being."" Funeral speakers included German football league president Theo Zwanziger, the team said, as well as team chairman Martin Kind and other dignitaries. Afterward, the team said Enke would be laid to rest ""in the presence of (his) closest family members."" Teresa Enke told reporters following Enke's death that her husband had been battling depression for six years, but had kept his condition from being public knowledge. He left a suicide note, she said. The Enkes' biological daughter, Lara, died in 2006 at the age of 2 from a heart condition. The couple recently had adopted an 18-month-old girl they named Leila. ""I tried to be there for him, said that football is not everything,"" Teresa Enke said. ""There are many beautiful things in life. It is not hopeless. ""We had Lara, we have Leila,"" she said. ""I always wanted to help him get through it. He didn't want (the depression) to come out because of fear. He was scared of losing Leila."" Have you lost a loved-one to suicide? Share your story . Fellow players said they knew Enke had been struggling. ""He was unstable,"" Kind said just after his death. ""But he kept it under wraps. In the wake of Enke's death, the German national soccer team canceled its friendly match with Chile on Saturday. Hannover 96 is currently 10th in Germany's Bundesliga top division. Enke had been capped by his national side eight times since making his debut at age 29. The shot-stopper had also appeared for teams including Carl Zeiss Jena, Borussia Monchengladbach, Benfica, Barcelona, Fenerbahce and Tenerife in Spain. --CNN's Frederik Pleitgen contributed to this report.","Thousands flock to Hannover 96 football stadium to play tribute to goalkeeper .

"(CNN)  -- Fort Hood, Texas, is -- for all intents and purposes -- a city. With as many as 30,000 residents, it has all the trappings of an American metropolis: malls, softball fields, subdivisions and as many as nine schools. But in other ways, Fort Hood is like no American city. It is a transition point for troops who have served overseas, soldiers who have seen the worst that war has to offer and are returning to life at home. At least 13 people were killed and 30 wounded in shootings on the post Thursday, officials said. The alleged gunman, identified as Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, 39, was wounded. Some of those killed or wounded were at the Readiness Center, a soldier's last stop before deployment, said Army Lt. Gen. Bob Cone. It is also one of the first places a soldier goes after returning from war. Officials: Gunman opens fire at Fort Hood . Lt. Gen. Russel Honore, who served at Fort Hood in the late 1990s, said the nearly eight years of war in Afghanistan and Iraq have created difficulties for the U.S. armed forces. ""This is a very complex situation, a situation we have not dealt with in the Army before. We have never been at war this long before in modern history,"" he said. ""And many of these soldiers have been deployed multiple times, so this has put a lot of stress on these soldiers and their families. ""One of the biggest things on re-entry that the Readiness Center does is to help those soldiers cope with being back home and dealing with the extremes of [post-traumatic stress disorder],"" Honore said. It is also where soldiers ""do everything from finalizing your next of kin, inspect your immunization record, as well as make a will,"" he said. Fort Hood is the largest U.S. military installation in the world by size, and on any given day, it is home to 25,000 to 30,000 people, according to an Army spokesman at the Pentagon. The post also houses the families of service members and other civilians. iReport.com: Are you there? Send pics, video . ""Some of these soldiers have lost some of their closest friends, seen some of the horrific things associated with warfare including these roadside bombs,"" Honore said. ""They've seen and experienced -- many of them -- some very horrific events."" Services and programs offered on the post range from helping troops who are leaving the armed services find employment or pursue education to helping soldiers deal with combat-related illnesses like post-traumatic stress disorder. One such program, called the Warrior Stress Reset Program, is ""designed to help address those common and normal reactions to war experiences,"" says a military Web site. ""It is well documented that participation in a major conflict ... has a way of leaving its mark on the psyche of our soldiers,"" the Web site reads. The program lasts three weeks and provides counseling and treatment. U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, said the post has a robust support system for families of deployed troops, which would help troops and civilians there handle Thursday's violence. ""The people who are there will surround the families and take care of them, the ones who have had loved ones who were killed,"" she said. The Army's 1st Cavalry Division and elements of the 4th Infantry Division, as well as the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment and the 13th Corps Support Command, are based at Fort Hood. Fort Hood measures about 340 square miles across and is approximately 160 miles south of Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Like all zombie movies, ""Zombieland"" has hundreds of zombies doing awful things, such as attacking and eating humans, but you could argue it's not a zombie movie. Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson find themselves battling the undead in ""Zombieland."" Zombie hordes do chase the main characters in a post-apocalyptic world, but the focus is on the comedy's stars, including two Oscar nominees -- Woody Harrelson and Abigail Breslin -- along with Jesse Eisenberg and Emma Stone. (Spoiler alert: A third Oscar nominee makes a remarkable cameo appearance, but this story will avoid spoiling the surprise by naming him.) ""We wanted to make a cool, kick-ass road movie about a dysfunctional family traveling across the country and zombies provide us the antagonists, the threat that our characters need to come together,"" said Paul Wernick, who wrote the screenplay with partner Rhett Reese. In fact, Wernick had only seen one zombie film before writing this script. Reese, who is a fan of the genre, kept the story on a track that would feed zombie fans' hunger for blood-and-guts action. ""[The] zombie genre is so well traveled, there is really no reason to get into it unless we could do it in a fresh, different way,"" Reese said. ""We were almost forced to think outside the box to make it an entertaining zombie movie."" ""Zombieland"" is set in the United States months after a fast-moving virus begins turning most people into flesh-eating zombies. A handful of survivors come together to fight back. Wernick and Reese literally rewrote the rules for zombie films in this movie. Eisenberg's character is an obsessive-compulsive man who developed 47 rules -- such as ""fasten your seat belt"" -- designed to help him survive in Zombieland. While Eisenberg journeys to find his parents, he joins Harrelson, a zombie killer who is searching for the last Hostess Twinkie before its expiration date. Stone and Breslin play sisters who survive on their con artist skills. Their goal is to reach a California amusement park, which they think could be free of zombies. The cross-country trip these four characters share resembles ""National Lampoon's Vacation"" -- if written and directed by Quentin Tarantino.  Watch the stars of the film talk about zombie fans » . Wernick said they wanted to be ""very freewheeling."" The movie ""gives the audience the thrill of the journey,"" he said. ""We wanted to take some wild turns."" ""The rules that we lived by when writing this is in fact that there are no rules,"" he said. ""Zombieland"" may be to zombies what Tarantino's ""Inglourious Basterds"" is to Nazis. Wernick and Reese, who have been close friends since high school, often finish each other's sentences as if they were an old married couple. ""When we were trying to get 'Zombieland' off the ground back in the early days, we ..."" Wernick said. ""... assaulted Tarantino at an awards show, to try to get him to read the script,"" Reese said. ""That didn't work out,"" Wernick said in conclusion to their joint thought. ""He thought we were zombies coming after him."" ""Zombieland,"" directed by Rubin Fleischer, offers many of the same elements as a Tarantino film. ""[Tarantino] is all about dialogue, character, irreverence, pop culture and we love all those things over the years,"" Reese said. ""We have always been inspired by him."" The writers had to run through a number of actors before finding the person for the 10-minute cameo. Among them was Patrick Swayze, the writers' first choice. Swayze, who died just two weeks before the movie's release, turned down the role because of ill health earlier this year. Also asked: Joe Pesci, Steven Seagal, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Matthew McConaughey, Mark Hamill, Kevin Bacon and Sylvester Stallone. They were asked, but either didn't want the role or were not available, according to Wernick and Reese. With just a few days before filming the scenes, they asked Harrelson to look in his cell phone for names and numbers. He came up with a man who's been an Oscar nominee and Emmy winner. And now, he's got a key role in a zombie film.","In new movie ""Zombieland,"" focus is on the stars and the comedy .

"(CNN) -- CNN has learned from two senior Democratic sources that former President Bill Clinton will attend the Senate Democrats' weekly luncheon Tuesday to address the caucus about health care. A notice obtained by CNN went out to Senate Democrats saying, ""All Senators should be aware that former President Clinton will be making a presentation on Health Care at tomorrow's caucus lunch. Senator Reid has requested that all Democratic Senators attend."" A constant refrain from Democratic leaders is that wavering Democrats must heed what they say is a lesson of the Clinton administration: fail to pass a health care reform bill, and congressional Democrats will suffer on Election Day. With this visit at a critical time for health care in the Senate, the former president will be able to deliver that message in person. Democrats in the House of Representatives approved a health care bill over the weekend. If the Senate passes a bill, a congressional conference committee will need to merge the House and Senate proposals into a consensus version requiring final approval from each chamber before moving to President Obama's desk to be signed into law. The House bill is more expansive -- and hence more expensive -- than the Senate Finance Committee bill. The House bill, projected to guarantee coverage for 96 percent of Americans, will cost more than $1 trillion over the next 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. CNN's Dana Bash, Brianna Keilar,Ted Barrett and Alan Silverleib contributed to this report.","Clinton will attend Senate Democrats' weekly luncheon Tuesday, sources tell CNN .

"(CNN) -- A jury Thursday acquitted a former Louisville, Kentucky, high school football coach of all charges connected to the heat-related death of a player last year. David Stinson leaves the courtroom Thursday after being found not guilty in the death of a high school player. The jury found former Pleasure Ridge Park football coach David Jason Stinson not guilty of reckless homicide and wanton endangerment in the death of 15-year-old Max Gilpin, who collapsed during a practice on August 20, 2008. The teenager died three days later. Gilpin's body temperature reached 107 degrees, officials say. Stinson also was acquitted on a charge of wanton endangerment.  Watch Stinson after his aquittal » . Prosecutors said Stinson ran a tough practice on a hot day that made several of his players sick. ""The defendant said to his kids, 'We're going to run until someone quits,' "" prosecutor Jon Heck alleged in his closing argument. ""A young man given that ultimatum, he ran until he collapsed. He turned white, his eyes rolled back. He could no longer support himself. ... He lost his consciousness, was ultimately taken to the hospital where his body temperature exceeded 107 degrees,"" Heck said of Gilpin. The defense argued that nothing was wrong with the practice and that other factors may have contributed to Gilpin's heat stroke. ""We're the first place in this country to indict a coach for a homicide or a felony involving a practice that nobody says they would have stopped,"" defense attorney Alex Dathorne said in his closing argument. ""There's nothing wrong with the practice; there's nothing wrong with it."" The defense presented witnesses who said Gilpin had complained that he wasn't feeling well the day he collapsed. Gilpin's parents have filed a wrongful death lawsuit against six coaches at the school. The suit claims they were negligent in their actions and that more than 20 minutes passed between the time Gilpin collapsed and the time one of the coaches called paramedics, according to CNN affilliate WHAS. Stinson is the only person who has been charged with a crime. Days after he was charged, Stinson told supporters that his ""heart is broken."" ""Part of my life has been taken away,"" he said, according to WHAS. ""I no longer teach, and I no longer coach at the school that I love. ... ""The one thing people keep forgetting in this is that I lost one of my boys that day,"" he said. ""It was a boy that I loved and a boy that I cared for and a boy that meant the world to me.

"(CNN) -- Keith Felch is admittedly a big guy, but more than a few super-fit cyclists in Southern California have been left wondering how that dude just went flying by. Keith Felch calls his electric bike a ""hill eraser"" because he can ride it to work without breaking a sweat. And then his wife, Mary, comes motoring past. ""They stare, like how can a girl go past me,"" she says, laughing. It takes the other riders a few seconds but then they figure it out. They have electric motors. The Felches, who live in Aliso Viejo, California, used to drive everywhere, except when they used their bikes for recreation. That changed when they got their new e-bikes, made by a company called Optibike. Now, they ride to go shopping and to go to breakfast -- but mostly they ride to work. Keith Felch says the couple has cut 50 percent of their car-use since they started electric biking. And there are other benefits. Keith Felch dropped 30 pounds and his blood pressure fell 10 points in the first six months he owned the bike, he says. The Felches don't exactly classify themselves as ""environmentalists,"" although Mary said it is important to have a positive effect on the planet. ""I learned that the worst amount of smog that you put out [in an automobile] is in the first mile, so if we can make even some of those shorter trips on our bicycles, it makes a big difference,"" she says. Who wants one? Brent Meyers, director of sales for Ultra Motor US, says electric bikes attract different types of buyers. Many are looking to make a green imprint. Some are ""active adults"" who have ridden bicycles for years who -- as they get older -- are unable to do the same kind of riding they did when they were young. Other buyers want to ride their bikes to work quickly -- and avoid a sweaty entrance into the office. Oddly -- or perhaps not -- Ultra Motor US sees its strongest sales when the price of oil skyrockets, says Meyers. Two wheels, a motor and 100 million riders . Electric bikes are still somewhat of a novelty in the United States, but in China they're everywhere. In fact, Chinese electric bikes number more than 100 million -- which is about four times the number of Chinese private cars, according to Electric Bikes Worldwide Reports. The bikes are popular in Europe as well. Sales figures for the United States are hard to pinpoint. In the United States, about 200,000 electric bicycles were sold last year, said Ed Benjamin of the Light Electric Vehicle Association -- about twice the number sold in 2005. But the industry has hit a bump in the road from the recession, as sales were down about 10 percent in 2009, he said. E-bikes are mostly made by specialty companies, but the growing sales trend has been noticed by the big boys. Trek, a worldwide leader in bike sales, has been making electric bikes for three years, but only introduced them in the United States in the past year. Other well-known companies like Schwinn and Giant are increasing their presence in the e-bike field. At Interbike, the biggest bicycle industry convention in the United States, there were more than 20 companies displaying e-bikes this year. Meyers said only a few years ago, it was about five. Prices range from a few hundred dollars -- the E-Zip Trailz Hybrid costs $398 at Wal-Mart -- to more than $13,000 for OptiBike's top-end model. Prices increase as battery technology and components get better. Steve Roseman of The Electric Bike Network in San Francisco, California, said most buyers he sees don't balk at the price, which can be as much as a good road or mountain bike. They are mostly concerned with how far they can go on a battery charge and how fast. What's an 'e-bike'? By law, electric bikes must have no more than 1 horsepower and go no faster than 20 mph (on motor power alone). Basically they are much like traditional bicycles with small motors that power the bike or assist a rider with pedaling. Many have gears like a regular bike. ""It's just adding the throttle aspect, other than that it handles like a regular bicycle,"" Keith Felch said. He says he uses the throttle all the time, choosing one of two modes -- eco [half power] or fast [full power]. He says he once tried a regular bike for his 4 ½-mile ride to one of his music studios where he teaches jazz improvisation. But the hills nearly got him. He calls his electric bike a ""hill eraser."" It also makes the ride to his farthest studio -- 22 miles away -- seem much closer. He says he gets about 35 miles on his primary battery and has an additional one for long rides. Shifting views . But as they tout the virtues of electric bikes, advocates also realize that there will have to be a shift in the way Americans view them before they become as popular as they are in Europe or China. ""There are two possible sides to the equation,"" Roseman said. ""One would be a change in the way people view transportation. There are still a lot of SUVs out there. ... People still have a hard time thinking about riding a bicycle unless they are 10 years old, it seems. So there needs to be a little shift in mentality."" ""But having said that, I think there is a growing awareness about health and transportation and environmental issues so it could be that we are just reaching a juncture where things will change [for e-bikes]."" Meyers says people also have a preconceived notion about electric bikes. Some view them as expensive or poor quality or uncomfortable. And Meyers admits, e-bikes are not for everybody. As Roseman says, people who live in Spandex will probably always prefer a really good road bike and hard-core city cyclists may well stick to their fixed-gear bikes. Meyers says Ultra, which sells its bike for $2,700, isn't for those kinds of people. ""That's not our customer,"" he says. ""Our customer is someone who wants some form of electric transportation, green transportation, that can get them from Point A to Point B comfortably."" The Felches say taking a test drive will change a skeptic's attitude. ""If you ride one, it will blow your mind,"" Keith Felch says. ""When you get on one it's like being in a flying dream you've had. It's like everything you've dreamed your bicycle should do in your wildest dreams -- it's doing it.""","Electric bikes can run either on pedal-power or their tiny motors .

"Washington (CNN) -- In the tight circle that surrounds President Obama, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs is in the inner bubble. He's the 3 a.m. wake-up call when North Korea fires a test missile, or when the Nobel committee picks the president for the top award. ""Trust me, it is a job I would gladly give to anybody who would volunteer,"" Gibbs said. Or would he? After all, he's an adviser, a friend and a mouthpiece for the administration with more access than recent press secretaries. ""I can walk in and ask him a question at any given time, pick up the phone and talk to him about anything at any given time. I think [that] makes my job easier,"" Gibbs said in an exclusive interview with CNN. The president and the press secretary first connected in 2004 when Obama was a virtual unknown outside of Chicago, Illinois, and was campaigning for the U.S. Senate. They clicked and grew close, leading Obama to tell the Wall Street Journal in a 2008 interview, ""Robert is the guy I want in the foxhole with me during incoming fire. If I'm wrong, he challenges me. He's not intimidated by me."" Gibbs chuckled while recalling the comment and quipped, ""That is when we called him 'Senator' or by his first name."" While challenging Obama when he was on a campaign bus is much different than pushing back in the Oval Office, Gibbs insists that Obama still seeks opposing opinions and dislikes an atmosphere where everyone tells him he's right. Ten months into his job in the White House, Gibbs, who grew up in Auburn, Alabama, says he's finally starting to get more comfortable, even though he admits that the 24/7 pace ""is certainly a challenge. It can wear you down."" Especially when it comes to the daily main event. Gibbs briefs the White House press corps, usually for about 45 minutes. He rarely shows up on time, but he's always ready to spar. The mouthpiece for the president often uses humor or sarcasm to deflect a tough question. In one exchange about the tit for tat over cable chatter and radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh, Gibbs uttered, ""I'll plead guilty to counterproductivity."" In another about managing the message, Gibbs said, ""Is there any evidence currently going on that I'm controlling the press? Poorly, I might add!"" Is this an effective strategy to handle the media? ""You tell me,"" Gibbs said. ""Look, there's no doubt that using a little humor to get out of a series of bad questions isn't an altogether bad technique."" Watch Gibbs talk about his job . Especially since he's involved in a daily high-wire act, as he calls it. The cameras are always rolling. A bad day for the White House spokesman usually means a bad day for the administration. ""My father likes reminding me he always thought my mouth would get me into sizable trouble, which it can on any given day,"" Gibbs said. Before starting his job, Gibbs studied former press secretaries and sought out their advice. He still relies on their guidance ""fairly frequently,"" he said. For example, Gibbs revealed that just last week he reached out to former Clinton spokesman Mike McCurry to get ""feedback on a question that was sort of nagging me a little bit."" When probed on what that question was, Gibbs replied, ""I'm not going to get into that, but good try."" Even with the major policy issues the White House is juggling, from Afghanistan to health care to the economy, Gibbs says he's still having fun. ""If you didn't enjoy the job that I have, it would be the worst job in all of Washington,"" he said. What he doesn't like, he said, is the fact that he's now a celebrity. ""People that I don't know recognize you walking down the street. It's awkward,"" he said.","White House spokesman has more access to president than recent predecessors .

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Six Haitian orphans, seized by national authorities last week as they prepared to journey to the United States, will be able to leave the earthquake-devastated country Wednesday. The U.S. Embassy retained custody of the children Tuesday and they were handed over to three American women who have been trying to escort them out. The women had attempted to leave Saturday when angry Haitians demanded to see their paperwork. Police suspected that a key document the women were carrying -- a permission signed by Haiti's prime minister -- was a fake, something the women and U.S. officials deny. There is no chance the paperwork is fake, said Sarah Thacker, one of the three women. Thacker, from Minnesota, was in Haiti to bring home her newly adopted son. Police did not arrest the women, but temporarily placed the children under government custody at a local orphanage. The women said Tuesday that they had been given permission to take the children to the United States. The women were staying with the children at a friend's house in Port-au-Prince. Full coverage of Haiti earthquake . The incident came nearly a month after the arrest of 10 U.S. missionaries accused of trying to take 33 Haitian children out of the country without proper paperwork. Eight of them have been released on bail and have returned to the United States. The question of Haitian children being removed from the country illegally came to the foreground after a magnitude-7.0 earthquake devastated parts of the country on January 12. Authorities feared that children left on their own -- because their parents died or they were separated from them -- would be targeted by child traffickers. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar has backed Thacker's efforts. ""They have filled out all the paperwork,"" she said. ""This is a legitimate orphanage that has brought other children to America. And I feel like these little babies are just caught up in this international dispute, and it's just not fair.""

"(CNN) -- Real Salt Lake sealed an upset win over the Los Angeles Galaxy on Sunday night with a 5-4 penalty victory, after extra-time in the Major League Soccer Cup final that ended with the score at 1-1. Robbie Russell netted the vital spot kick after Real Salt Lake goalkeeper Nick Rimando made two saves and MLS Most Valuable Player, and LA Galaxy captain, Langdon Donovan sent his shot sailing over the crossbar. Salt Lake's win at the Qwest Field arena in Seattle, ended David Beckham's bid to claim a third national title in as many different nations, having previously won the English Premier League with Manchester United and La Liga with Spain's Real Madrid. The Galaxy struck first, with midfielder Mike Magee drilling a 41st-minute shot into an open net. His strike came after Beckham passed to Donovan, who set-up Magee at the far post. Seattle: America's soccer city. Real Salt Lake hit back with 25 minutes left when Robbie Findley reacted first after Yuri Movsisyan's attempt on goal was blocked, tying the match and setting up the penalty shootout. Beckham got the Galaxy off to a good start in the shoot out as he scored with confidence, but his team could not follow in the same manner. Jovan Kirovski's shot was blocked by Rimando, but Saunders followed by stopping the effort of Salt Lake captain Kyle Beckerman before Donovan blazed over the crossbar to leave the score 5-4. Galaxy came into the game as  favorites, but flattered to deceive as it was revealed Beckham had played with an injured right ankle. ""We all want to win titles and personally I'd love to be successful but I think we have been successful this year without winning tonight,"" Beckham told reporters after the game. ""We have quietened a few people along the way which is always nice but we couldn't finish it off. ""I wouldn't say it's tougher to lose on penalties but it's Russian roulette, that's just the way it is. It's not a nice way to lose. ""The people that step up are brave enough to step up and if you score, great and if you miss it's hard to take, but it just wasn't our night,"" Beckham added. Beckham is due to return to AC Milan in January for another loan spell as he bids to secure a place in England's World Cup squad for next year's finals in South Africa. The English midfielder's future in the U.S. had appeared in doubt earlier in the season when his commitment was called into question following a loan spell with the Italian club during which he had indicated an apparent desire to continue playing in Italy. Beckham had earlier said that playing in Sunday's final ranked alongside winning the Primera Liga title with Real Madrid in 2003 and a trophy-laden spell at Manchester United that included six English Premier League titles and the 1999 Champions League crown. ""Anytime you reach a certain part of the season, whether it's being in a cup final or winning leagues, it's always special,"" Beckham said.

"(CNN) -- David Beckham believes the furore that followed his return to the LA Galaxy from his loan spell with AC Milan earlier this year has galvanized the team. The Galaxy won the MLS Western Conference Championship with a 2-0 win at home to Houston Dynamo on Friday night, Beckham setting up Gregg Berhalter's 102nd-minute opener. They will face Real Salt Lake, who upset the favored Chicago Fire 5-4 in a penalty shootout to win the Eastern Conference title on Saturday to reach the MLS Cup final in Seattle next Sunday. Beckham had been subjected to abuse by his own fans after missing the start of the MLS season when he was in Italy, while Galaxy captain Landon Donovan questioned his commitment to the LA franchise. However, the England midfielder -- who missed Saturday's 1-0 friendly defeat by Brazil in Qatar to play for his club -- thinks the situation helped bring the team together. ""There's nothing wrong with a bit of controversy in a club, it brings players and teams together and it's done that,"" Beckham told ESPN in a post-match interview. ""I don't have to say anything about myself, I leave that down to other people to decide. ""I love playing soccer. I work hard for my teammates, myself, my manager, the fans and I hope that's enough for people."" Beckham joined the Galaxy from Real Madrid in 2007 but they struggled to make an impact during the Englishman's time with the team until the arrival of former USA national team coach Bruce Arena. Beckham, who returns to Milan in January as he bids to win a place in England's World Cup squad, believes this season's achievements have already gone some way for making up for the previous two seasons.

"(CNN) -- Don Shows was a computer geek until he lost his job and took a road trip. JetBlue promises to refund some tickets purchased before a traveler is laid off from a job. While the 56-year-old from Dayton, Ohio, was away on his eight-day post-layoff adventure, he decided he really wanted to be a photojournalist. ""I ran into some interesting situations when I was out touring around the backcountry"" of the Midwest, he said. ""The road map is handy, but sometimes the road you're looking for is not there."" Stories like Shows' are more common these days. The unemployment rate was at 7.6 percent in January, and, strange as it may seem, at least one travel company, an airline and a travel-bag maker are now catering to the layoff crowd -- both the recently let go and the future unemployed. For those who buy a plane ticket before they get the ax, JetBlue is offering to refund fares. The JetBlue Promise promotion is good for customers laid off on or after February 17 and applies to ticket purchases made between February 1 and June 1. The program is designed to appeal to people who haven't been downsized but worry they might be, said Alison Croyle, a spokeswoman for the airline. ""It's something that we felt would provide an advantage to customers who otherwise might be too stressed to book future travel plans,"" she said. Then there's the already-laid-off demographic. On some packages, Intrepid Travel is giving a 15 percent discount to people who've recently been let go. The deal, with the tongue-in-cheek title, ""Laid off? How about taking off?"" has gotten a few dozen takers in the two months it's been offered, said Leslie Cohen, spokeswoman for the travel company. Cohen said the discount is designed to give people a chance to clear their heads during a tough transition. Some of the deals start at less than $1,000, she said. The company is ""not suggesting you use your life savings,"" she said. ""It's really just a chance to catch your breath and see something else and come back in a little bit of a different frame of mind."" For those looking to hit the skies on the job hunt rather than escape it, SkyRoll, maker of a $149.99 garment bag, says it's giving a discount. ""If you recently lost your job and need to travel for an interview, we will take 50 percent off the price of a SkyRoll to help you arrive looking your best,"" the company says on its Web site. To get the discount, SkyRoll requires customers to e-mail the company a layoff notice. Travel discounts like the one from Intrepid may be great for unemployed people who have hefty savings accounts or large severance packages, but the program also could prey on the unemployed, said Madeline Hughes, who runs a consulting and outplacement group in Denver, Colorado. The cost of a big trip ""could be lunch money for somebody for the next six months,"" she said. Hughes tells her clients who are laid off they need to come up with a career plan -- and quickly -- because the job market is so competitive. If a person truly has a thick enough checkbook to afford a post-layoff vacation, Hughes said she would tell the person to send out plenty of resumes before hitting the beach. ""If you really do want to get away, then at least get somewhat of a plan so when you're on vacation you're not fretting about what you're going to do when you get back,"" she said. ""People can't relax if they're afraid and they don't have a plan and they're sort of panicked."" Daphne Domingo, a life coach in Seattle, Washington, said people who've been laid off should take vacations so they have time to reassess their lives -- but they should gauge the scope of their travel on their savings account. ""Be a tourist in your own town"" if you don't have the money to travel, she said. ""That way, you can save money on accommodations."" Domingo and Hughes said all job seekers should weigh their situations individually. Jonathan Hagelstein, a 32-year-old from New York, plans to use Intrepid's package to travel to Africa and Europe for nearly a month. This is the second major trip he's taken since being laid off from a finance job in June. But Hagelstein says he's a ""compulsive saver"" and wants to make use of the free time while he has it. ""Time is something that you can never get back. You can always earn more money,"" he said. ""I'm not getting any younger. ... This is an opportunity -- I feel -- of a lifetime."" With each trip, he hopes the job market will be better when he returns. He said he has no leads on a job. Shows -- the man from Ohio, who first shared his story on iReport.com, CNN's user-submitted content site -- took off on a road trip as a way to reanalyze his life. See Shows' story on iReport.com . He said he hadn't taken a substantial trip during the decade or so he worked in information technologies at LexisNexis, a database and information company. So he saw the layoff partly as a gift of free time. Shows said he has a stable enough income since he is also a retired police officer. But he said his car trip was relatively cheap. The adventure took him to six states and cost less than $1,000, he said. Plus, it helped him reconnect with his passion. ""If I could do anything I wanted to do in life, it would be to take the camera out and go out to talk to people and get stories,"" he said. Shows said he plans to take photojournalism classes at a local community college this spring.","Travel companies and an airline are catering to the layoff crowd .

"(CNN)  -- Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa denied Saturday that a Colombian guerrilla group donated money to his 2006 presidential campaign, asking his country's civil commission to investigate the allegation. Ecuador's President Rafael Correa, as pictured in June, says a probe into FARC's claims will clear his name. Colombian media broadcast a 2008 video Friday in which guerrilla leader Víctor Julio Suarez Rojas, better known as Mono Jojoy, said the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia donated money to Correa's campaign. The guerrilla group, known by its Spanish acronym FARC, also has had conversations with Correa's emissaries and has reached ""some accords, according to documents that we have,"" Suarez said in a videotape. Correa denied the allegations and said he wants the nation's civil commission to see ""if the Ecuadorian government, if the Alianza PAIS [political party] has received 20 cents from any foreign group, not just from the FARC."" The leftist president said that during the campaign, some opponents accused him of receiving money from leftist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, from drug cartels and from the FARC.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama huddled with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and other top military advisers at the White House on Friday as the administration continued its sweeping review of U.S. strategy in Afghanistan. Each branch of the armed services was given a direct opportunity to tell Obama the effect on the military if a large number of additional forces are sent to Afghanistan, two military sources told CNN's Barbara Starr. The meeting was the seventh in a series of high-level discussions being held in part to forge a consensus on how best to confront Taliban and al Qaeda militants threatening the governments of Afghanistan and Pakistan. ""The president wants to get input from different services,"" White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said earlier this week. ""It's a chance to consult with uniformed military leadership as a part of his [Afghanistan-Pakistan] review."" The potential for a major expansion of the number of U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan comes with some misgivings from the military chiefs. The Army and Marine Corps have expressed concerns that it could make it tougher to give troops promised time at home with their families between overseas tours. The White House strategy review is being conducted against a backdrop of rising U.S. casualties in Afghanistan and increased Taliban violence. October has already become the deadliest month for U.S. forces since the war began in late 2001, with the deaths of 56 American troops. Taliban militants have become increasingly bold. This week, they attacked a U.N. guesthouse in central Kabul, killing five U.N. staff members. There also is political turmoil surrounding a planned November 7 Afghan presidential election runoff. On Friday, a source close to the Afghan leadership told CNN that President Hamid Karzai's runoff opponent, Abdullah Abdullah, would withdraw from the race. The presidential campaign has become increasingly contentious as Abdullah demanded the removal of the country's election chief and 200 other staffers of the election commission to ensure a fair runoff. Abdullah and others have charged that massive fraud occurred in the first round of voting on August 20. The initial results gave Karzai the win, but a subsequent review by a U.N.-backed panel of election monitors threw out nearly one-third of Karzai's votes because of ""clear and convincing evidence of fraud."" The result left Karzai short of the 50 percent needed to avoid a runoff. After a flurry of meetings with U.S. and U.N. officials, the Afghan president agreed to the runoff.","Obama meets with national security advisers on Afghanistan .

"(CNN) -- The man who accused pop star Michael Jackson of molesting his son in 1993 killed himself in his New Jersey condo earlier this month, police said. Evan Chandler, 65, was found by the building's concierge November 5 after a doctor, who was treating him for cancer, said he missed an appointment, the Jersey City, New Jersey, police report said. Chandler was ""extremely ill"" with cancer, the report said. He was working as a dentist in Beverly Hills, California, in 1993 when he said his son, who was 13 at the time, told him that Jackson had molested him. His son revealed it, he said, when he put him under anesthesia to pull a tooth. The Los Angeles County district attorney did not pursue criminal charges against Jackson, but Chandler and his son reached a confidential financial settlement with the singer after filing a lawsuit. Reports at the time said the Chandlers got between $16 million and $20 million from Jackson's insurance company. The Chandler accusation became a key part of the prosecution's case when Jackson was tried and acquitted of molestation a decade later in Santa Barbara County, California. The elder Chandler was found ""on his bed in a lifeless state with a gun in his hand,"" the investigator's report said. ""The victim had a silver revolver in his right hand which was pressed against the right side of his head,"" Officer J.S. Sielski wrote. Chandler, who was estranged from most of his family, owned the .38-caliber pistol he used to kill himself, Jersey City spokesman Stan Eason said. No suicide note was found, Eason added. Chandler's brother -- a lawyer in Santa Barbara County -- told CNN in 2003 that Chandler feared for his life because of threats made by angry Jackson fans. ""There's a hard-core group, there was and probably still is, of fanatical fans who see him as a deity,"" Ray Chandler told CNN's Larry King. ""Some of them will go to any lengths that, you know, there's some who will just go as far as threatening, there's some who will go -- who will be violent, and you know, you never know how far it is going to go."" Ray Chandler has not responded to calls from CNN for comment about his brother's death.","In 1993, Evan Chandler said Michael Jackson had molested son .

"Cleveland, Ohio (CNN) -- The niece of the mayor of Cleveland, Ohio, once lived with murder suspect Anthony Sowell, a registered sex offender charged with murder after the remains of 11 victims were found at his home, a spokeswoman for the mayor said Monday. Lori Frazier, niece of Mayor Frank Jackson, had a relationship with Sowell that ended two years ago, said Andrea Taylor, a spokeswoman for Jackson's office. Taylor said it is unclear whether the relationship was romantic. ""I just want to know why, why he would do this,"" Frazier told CNN affiliate WOIO on Friday. ""He took care of me, good care of me. I never would have thought there were some bodies in the house."" ""I lived with him from 2005 to 2007 and he didn't kill me, but he killed all these girls,"" she said. Sowell, 50, is facing five counts of aggravated murder, rape, felonious assault and kidnapping in connection with the deaths. All the victims were African-American women. All that remains of one of them is a skull, wrapped in a paper bag and stuffed into a bucket in the basement. Sowell served 15 years in prison after pleading guilty to attempted rape in 1989. He was released in 2005. So far, nine of the 11 victims found at Sowell's home have been identified. The latest two were identified Monday by the Cuyahoga County Coroner's Office, police said. They are Janice Webb, 49, and Kim Yvette Smith, who was 43 when last seen. Both women were from Cleveland. Webb was last seen on June 3 and was reported missing on August 2, police said. Smith was last seen January 1, but was not reported missing until November 2. A grand jury on Monday returned an indictment against Sowell in connection with an alleged assault and rape of a 36-year-old woman September 22, Cuyahoga County prosecutors said in a news release. The investigation into that incident was what led police, armed with a search warrant, to Sowell's home, where they discovered the bodies late last month. The alleged victim encountered Sowell while walking in the neighborhood, and he took her back to his home, where he became violent and raped her, prosecutors said. ""While raping her, he strangled her with a cord until she lost consciousness,"" the statement said. ""When she regained consciousness, he led her out of the house."" Sowell faces a charge of attempted murder in the incident, along with two counts of rape, two counts of kidnapping and two counts of felonious assault, authorities said. Sowell will be arraigned on the new charges Friday, authorities said. The charges are first-degree felonies except for the assault charges, which are second-degree felonies, prosecutors said. If convicted, he would face a sentence of up to life in prison. The investigation into the homicides continues, prosecutor Bill Mason said in the news release. ""Upon completion of the investigation, the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor's Office working with the Cleveland Police Department will present evidence to the grand jury seeking the death penalty for these heinous murders committed by Sowell."" Residents of the area near the home said they had noted a smell in the neighborhood, but assumed it was from nearby Ray's Sausage Company. Asked whether she had noticed a foul odor, Frazier told WOIO, ""Yeah, I smelled stuff, but he always told me that -- at first he said it was his stepmother downstairs. And then I guess after she left, he told me that it was Ray's Sausage."" Frazier said Sowell brought other women to the home when she was not there. ""I love my niece very much and while she has made some decisions that have not been in her best interest, she has my full support,"" Jackson said in a written statement. ""As a family, we are extremely fortunate that she was not a victim in this case as she did have a prior relationship with the suspect that ended approximately two years ago. My focus continues to be on making sure the loved ones of the victims get the attention, closure and justice they deserve and it is my hope that everyone remains committed to that goal."" Hundreds of Cleveland residents gathered outside the house Sunday night to remember the victims. ""It's hard, because I want to burn it down,"" said Inez Fortson, whose daughter Telacia, 31 and a mother of three children, is among the dead. Sowell has been placed on a suicide watch at the request of his attorney, according to Sowell's public defender, Kathleen DeMetz. A psychiatric evaluation has been ordered but it's unlikely to happen until after the case goes before a grand jury, the next expected step. Police recovered the first bodies after they went to Sowell's home to follow up on a rape accusation. In a separate incident, neighbors on October 20 reported seeing a naked woman fall from the second floor. Firefighters and paramedics responded, and later notified police. But the woman told officers that she was at the home ""partying,"" when she fell off the roof, and no charges were filed. Agents from the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit are assisting Cleveland police, Cleveland FBI spokesman Scott Wilson has said. The agents are preparing a profile of Sowell for police, tracing his life and habits, and his DNA will be entered into a national database to see whether it can be linked to any unsolved crimes. ""Our experts tell us it's likely he's done this before,"" said Frank Figliuzzi, special agent in charge of the FBI's Cleveland office. ""He's probably done it elsewhere, and so we need to determine whether or not he's responsible for other unsolved murders and rapes around the country."" In addition, the FBI is investigating whether Sowell might be linked to crimes abroad, Figliuzzi said. ""We know, for example, he was a Marine, he was assigned to California, he served in Okinawa, Japan, and we'll be matching all the facts from these crimes here in Cleveland with the crimes that remain unsolved in our database, and we'll specifically be looking at those locations where he's previously lived."" Allen Sowell, the suspect's half-brother, told CNN he last saw his brother more than 20 years ago. Their stepmother, who lived in the house after Anthony Sowell got out of prison, said she knew of nothing odd going on at the time, Allen Sowell said. The stepmother tried to get Anthony Sowell evicted from the house in 2007 because he wasn't paying rent, Allen Sowell said. Anthony Sowell said he shouldn't have to pay rent on a house that belonged to his father, who died in 2004.  Anthony Sowell remained in the house when his stepmother had to be hospitalized in 2007, his half-brother said. Allen Sowell said he was aware of his half-brother's prison record, but ""just couldn't fathom"" the accusations now facing him. ""I didn't think he was in that bad of a mental state,"" Allen Sowell said. ""You never think it would happen to your family. It's a horrible feeling."" At 66, Allen Sowell is 16 years older than his half-brother, and the two didn't meet until Anthony Sowell was 9. He added, ""He deserves whatever he gets from the justice system."" CNN's Susan Candiotti, Edmund Demarche and Ross Levitt and CNN Radio's Brendan Gage contributed to this report.","NEW: Mayor Frank Jackson: ""I love my niece very much ... she has my full support""

"CAIRO, Egypt (CNN) -- Egypt is suspending ties with France's famous Louvre museum until the latter returns artifacts that it knew were stolen when it purchased them, the head of the country's antiquities council said Wednesday. Egypt accuses the Louvre museum of failing to make good on promises to return antiquities. Zahi Hawass, director of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, said he wrote a letter seven years ago to major museums around the world asking them to consult with Egyptian authorities before buying any ancient Egyptian artifacts from outside sellers. Hawass said the Louvre had bought five murals chipped off the walls from a tomb in Thebes and been stolen by antiquities robbers in the 1980s. He sent a letter to the Louvre a year ago asking that the stolen paintings be returned, he said. The museum promised to return the items but has not followed through, he said. Until it does so, Egypt will suspend its cooperation with the Louvre, Hawass said. A Louvre spokesman declined to comment on Egypt's claims. Egypt maintains antiquities exchange programs with museums around the world. The Louvre is one of the biggest repositories of ancient Egyptian antiquities in the world, much of it treasure taken during the time of the French and British occupation of the country. Egypt's position is that artifacts taken by European powers during that period are a fait accompli, but anything taken illegally since Egypt's independence must be returned. This has been one of the major emphases of Hawass since he became head of the Supreme Council of Antiquities in 2002. Egypt took similar steps against museums in England and Belgium in the past. Those ties were restored after the artifacts in question were returned, Hawass said.","Egypt suspends ties with France's famous Louvre museum .

"(CNN) -- Botswana has been hailed as one of Africa's success stories and a beacon for democracy on the continent. It's home to Africa's longest continuous multi-party democracy and has remained politically stable since gaining independence in 1966. President Ian Khama took office in April 2008 promising steady progress. At its helm is President Ian Khama, the country's former vice president and son of Botswana's founding president. The diamond trade and disciplined government have helped to transform Botswana from one of the world's poorest nations to a middle-income country. But there are still large problem facing the country, including the world's second high level of HIV infections, according to the World Bank, and a slowing of the countries economic growth. The 56-year-old Khama took over office in April 2008, succeeding Festus Mogae who had been in power for 10 years, promising no radical departure from his predecessor's policies. Khama was born in southern England and trained at the UK's Sandhurst Military Academy before returning to Botswana and later becoming the commander of the Botswana Defence Force. He left the military in 1998 to take up the position of vice president. As the son of Botswana's most popular former president, political analysts inside the country have expected Khama to unite the factions in the ruling Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) and continue steady economic and political progress. While Khama has only been in power for 11 months, there has been some criticism that his style is too authoritarian. Citing Afrobarometer, an independent research group, Botswana's newspaper Sunday Standard recently wrote that there was a growing public perception that Khama has issued more directives compared to his predecessors. One area in which he has taken a definite line is on his policy towards neighboring Zimbabwe, publicly opposing the government of President Robert Mugabe and declaring it illegitimate. A general election is set for October 2009, with the BDP expected to win. No other political party has held power in Botswana and some commentators fear the emergence of a political dynasty that would affect Botswana's democracy.","Botswana's President Ian Khama talks to CNN on 'African Voices'

"(CNN) -- Out-of-shape swimming superstar Michael Phelps again struggled as an unprecedented 16 records were set at the World Cup short-course event in Berlin this weekend. Six new marks were set on Saturday and another 10 on Sunday, but the American could only manage a second in the 200 meters individual medley and a fifth in the 200m butterfly while failing to reach the final of the 200m freestyle. The 14-time Olympic champion chose to wear an old-style suit as he did with a similar lack of success in the previous leg in Stockholm during the week, and took a back seat to those wearing high-tech outfits -- which will be outlawed from January 1. ""I prefer not to lose, but I knew coming in that it would be very, very hard to win anything,"" the bearded Phelps told reporters. ""I raced as hard as I could, I've gotten some racing under my belt, and that's what we set out to do. Maybe it's better for me that I lost today. It gives me better motivation for the future. ""I am pleased with the week as much as I can be, with how much training I've done -- which is little, and it shows."" He performed better on Sunday as he finished runner-up in the medley behind South Africa's Darian Townsend, who set a world-record time of one minute 51.55 seconds -- beating Phelps by 1.85 seconds. On Saturday, his much-anticipated showdown with world 200m freestyle champion Paul Biedermann never eventuated as he finished 12th in the heats, while the supersuit-clad German set a new record in the final and also smashed Grant Hackett's seven-year-old milestone in the 400m freestyle. Among the women's records to be broken, Australia's Liesel Jones followed up her two gold medals from the Beijing Olympics by setting a new mark on each day. The 24-year-old won the 200m breaststroke on Sunday in a time of 2:15.42, shaving more than a second off the previous record, while the day before she topped her own leading time in the 100m breaststroke.","An unprecedented 16 records fall at the World Cup short-course event in Berlin this weekend .

"(CNN) -- Authorities on Saturday released the names of three more victims found last week in or around the home of a registered sex offender in Cleveland, Ohio. The Cuyahoga County Coroner's Office identified the bodies of Amelda Hunter, 47; Crystal Dozier, 38; and Michelle Mason, 45, all of Cleveland. Anthony Sowell, who served 15 years after pleading guilty to attempted rape in a 1989 case, was arrested last week, two days after police discovered the first bodies at his home. He faces five counts of aggravated murder, rape, felonious assault and kidnapping, police said, and was denied bond at a hearing Wednesday. Police have discovered the bodies of 10 people and skull of an 11th victim at or near Sowell's home. Authorities have identified seven of the victims. Remains of six victims were found inside the home. police said, and five outside. The skull was wrapped in a paper bag and stuffed into a bucket in the basement, police said. Hunter was not reported as a missing person at the time of the discovery of the victim's bodies at Sowell's residence, according to the Cleveland Police Department. Her family reported her missing on November 3, telling police that she was last seen on or about April 18. Dozier also was never reported missing to police. She was reportedly last seen in October 2007, police said. Mason was reported missing on October 12, 2008. She was last seen earlier that month, according to police. At the time, it was reported that Mason suffered from bipolar disorder and was not taking her prescribed medications, police said. Sowell has been placed on a suicide watch at the request of his attorney, according to his public defender, Kathleen DeMetz. A psychiatric evaluation has been ordered but it's unlikely to happen until after a grand jury files an indictment, she said. Sowell is being held in a solitary cell in the Cuyahoga County jail, wearing a white paper gown, County Jail Warden Kevin McDonough told CNN. Every 10 minutes, a guard checks on him to make sure he doesn't hurt himself. Occasionally, Sowell is allowed out of his cell under escort to shower and use a dayroom with books and magazines, but no television, McDonough said. He gets three meals a day. Lights are out at 10 p.m. ""He's been quiet and compliant,"" McDonough said. ""He understands what incarceration is like."" Sowell was released from jail in 2005. According to court documents, Sowell completed several programs while in jail, including ""Living Without Violence,"" ""Positive Personal Change"" and ""Cage your Rage."" In another court document filed shortly before his release and obtained by CNN, handwritten notes state Sowell ""would be likely to re-offend because he still denies the rape."" Previously, the coroner's office said it had identified the bodies of Nancy Cobbs, 43; Tonia Carmichael, 52; Telacia Fortson, 31; and Tishana Culver, 31. Police initially went to Sowell's home last week to follow up on a rape accusation. Last month, neighbors reported seeing a naked woman fall from the second floor, but no charges were filed. Neighbors called 911 after the October 20 incident. Firefighters and paramedics responded, and later notified police. The woman told officers that she was at the home and ""partying,"" when she fell off the roof. ""They were doing coke, drugs, getting high,"" Cleveland Police Chief Michael McGrath said. A man described as her boyfriend -- Sowell -- told police the same story.

"(CNN) -- A major investor in convicted swindler Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme drowned in his swimming pool in Florida after a heart attack, his attorney said Monday. The medical examiner's office confirmed the report. Jeffry Picower, 67, was found unconscious in his pool shortly after noon Sunday at his Palm Beach,  Florida,, home by his wife, Palm Beach police said. He was pronounced dead at Good Samaritan Hospital. Picower's attorney, William Zabel, told CNN that Picower drowned after suffering a massive heart attack. Sue Jaffe, spokeswoman for the Palm Beach County medical examiner, confirmed those details. In September, Forbes magazine ranked Picower No. 371 among the 400 richest Americans, with a net worth of $1 billion. In March, Madoff was convicted of operating a Ponzi scheme and defrauding thousands of investors. He was sentenced to 150 years in prison after pleading guilty to 11 felony counts of fraud, money laundering and perjury. Prosecutors have said it was the largest investor fraud ever committed by a single person, totaling billions in losses to investors. When the Picower Foundation of Palm Beach announced it was shutting down early this year because of Madoff losses, it initially appeared that the prominent philanthropist had been an unfortunate victim of Madoff's Ponzi scheme. Picower's 2007 tax return had valued his foundation's portfolio at $955 million. However, in May, court filings by Madoff trustee Irving Picard changed the picture. The trustee's complaint claimed that Picower had been a key beneficiary of Madoff's Ponzi scheme for more than 20 years, and ""knew or should have known that [he] was profiting from fraud because of the implausibly high rates of return"" on his accounts. Those ""anomalous and astronomical rates of return"" -- as high as 500 percent in one year and 950 percent in another year -- ""were neither credible nor consistent with legitimate trading activity, and should have caused any reasonable investor ... to inquire further,"" the court filings said, referring to Picower as ""a sophisticated investor, accountant and lawyer."" Citing backdated account filings and other bogus paperwork, the complaint contends that ""Picower and the other defendants also knew or should have known that they were reaping the benefits of manipulated purported returns, false documents and fictitious profit."" The Picowers recently told The New York Times that the publicity and controversy surrounding their connection to Bernie Madoff had been a great source of heartache. ""We always have been private people, and having all this play out in the media has taken a big toll on our health,"" the couple wrote in response to questions posed by reporters. ""We feel stunned, betrayed, angry, sickened, devastated,"" they said, and were only able to draw strength and consolation ""from each other and from the knowledge that we did nothing wrong.""","Jeffry Picower, 67,  found unconscious in his pool in his Palm Beach, Florida .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Gertrude Baines, the world's oldest person, has died in Los Angeles, California, at the age of 115, according to the home where she lived and Guinness World Records said Saturday. Gertrude Baines said she attributed her longevity to not drinking or smoking. Gertrude Baines passed away at the Western Convalescent Hospital at 7:25 a.m. (10:25 a.m. ET) Friday, Guinness World Records said. Born in 1894, Baines became the world's oldest person in January after the death of another 115-year-old, Maria de Jesus, from Portugal, Guinness World Records said. At her 115th birthday party in April, Baines shook her head in disbelief when presented with the certificate saying she was now in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's oldest person. ""She told me that she owes her longevity to the Lord, that she never did drink, never did smoke, and she never did fool around,"" her doctor, Dr. Charles Witt, said in April. Baines, whose grandparents were slaves, worked as a maid in Ohio State University dormitories until her retirement, and lived at the Los Angeles convalescent home for more than 10 years. Last November, she became the oldest African-American to vote for President Obama and received a letter from him on her 115th birthday, Guinness World Records said. Witt said Baines planned to vote for Obama again in 2012. Asked why she voted for Obama, Baines said it was because ""he's for the colored people,"" according to footage from The Los Angeles Times. She said she never thought a black man could become president. ""Everybody's glad for a colored man to be in there sometime,"" Baines said. ""We all are the same on the skin. It's dark, and theirs is white."" Baines had few complaints, her doctor said. She fussed about the bacon not being crisp enough and the arthritis in her knees, Witt said. The smooth skin on Baines' face belied her 115 years, but she didn't attribute that to any anti-wrinkle cream or miracle product, according to her best friend, Lucille Fayall. She said Baines simply washed her face in cold water.","Gertrude Baines dies at age 115, was world's oldest person .

"Lima, Peru (CNN) -- Peru will turn over to Chilean authorities all evidence into allegations that a Peruvian air force officer was spying for the neighboring country, Peruvian President Alan Garcia said Monday. Garcia ordered his foreign minister and justice department to hand over all details of the investigation so Chile could ""give the corresponding explanations,"" he said in a televised address. The alleged spying by Chile, Garcia declared, was the result of fear and an inferiority complex by the Chileans. He added that Peru will not let the incident become a full-blown crisis between the two nations. The suspect, Victor Ariza Mendoza, remained imprisoned at a maximum security facility north of Lima, authorities said. Two other Peruvian air force officers, accused of being collaborators, also were detained, as were two Chilean military officers who were alleged accomplices, CNN en Español reported. Mendoza could face charges of treason, which carry a minimum sentence of 25 years. News of the spy case caused Garcia to prematurely end a trip to Singapore for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation. Garcia and his Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet, had planned to attend a workshop Saturday with other world leaders, but the Peruvian leader canceled his agenda to return to Lima. Chile has dismissed the espionage allegations. ""Chile has nothing to do with this case,"" Chilean Foreign Minister Mariano Fernandez told reporters after a meeting with his nation's ambassador to Peru. According to local media, the suspected spy once worked at the Peruvian Embassy in Chile and sold secrets to the Chileans since 2002, CNN en Español reported. Chile and Peru have a history of animosity, having fought in the War of the Pacific from 1879 to 1883. Hard feelings linger to this day. The two nations nearly came to war in 1975, when left-wing Peruvian leader Juan Velasco, who was backed by Cuba, wanted to invade Chile, which was led by right-wing Gen. Augusto Pinochet. The invasion was called off, and Velasco was deposed in a coup a short while later. Tensions rose again when Peru discovered a Chilean spy mission, but war was averted. More recently, tensions between the two South American nations flared in December after the revelation that Peru's top army general said at a party that Chileans in Peru would be sent back in coffins or body bags. Both countries said they would work to heal relations after the general's comments.

"(CNN) -- A self-help expert said Tuesday that he has hired his own investigators to determine what happened at his Arizona retreat last week, when two people died after spending considerable time in a sweat lodge. Self-help author James Arthur Ray has hired investigators to investigate two deaths at an Arizona sweat lodge. Tuesday's tearful speech before about 200 supporters was the first time that best-selling self-help author James Arthur Ray had publicly discussed the case. Authorities said James Shore of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Kirby Brown of Westtown, New York, died Friday at the Angel Valley Resort after spending up to two hours in the sauna-like sweat lodge. Nineteen others were treated for injuries. ""I have no idea what happened. We'll figure it out,"" Ray said, adding that he had hired investigators. ""I've lost people I love and really care about."" Police are also investigating the incident at the central Arizona resort, located in a secluded valley 20 minutes from Sedona. Ray is the author of the best-selling book ""Harmonic Wealth: The Secret of Attracting the Life You Want."" Ray, described on his Web site as a ""personal success strategist,"" has appeared on CNN's ""Larry King Live"" and the ""Oprah Winfrey Show,"" and is featured in the self-empowerment film ""The Secret."" On Tuesday, Ray told the crowd that he is struggling with the deaths. ""These are challenging times,"" he said. ""I've faced many; none like this. I don't know how to deal with it really."" The use of sweat lodges for spiritual and physical cleansing is a part of several Native American tribes' cultures. A traditional Native American sweat lodge is a small dome-like structure made up of willow branches carefully tied together and covered in canvas. Rocks are heated in a nearby fire pit and placed inside the lodge, and water is poured over them to create steam.

"(CNN) -- The $410 billion budget President Obama signed Wednesday will make it easier for U.S. residents to travel to Cuba and to send money to family members on the island. It also could facilitate the sale of agricultural and pharmaceutical products to Cuba. The residents of Havana, Cuba, often rely on bicycle taxis for transportation. Three provisions attached to the omnibus spending bill loosened restrictions enacted by then-President George W. Bush after he came to office in 2001. Analysts see the move as a way for the new Obama administration to start thawing relations with Cuba one month before the Fifth Summit of the Americas brings together the U.S. president and 33 other leaders from the Western Hemisphere in Trinidad and Tobago. ""[Cuba] is the issue of greatest symbolic importance,"" said Peter Hakim, president of the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue policy institute. ""It will be seen as a test of real U.S. readiness to change in the hemisphere. What he says about Cuba will make headlines."" Hakim testified about Latin American policy Wednesday before the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Cuba and the United States have had a troubled relationship since Fidel Castro came to power in 1959. The United States broke off diplomatic relations in 1961 and imposed a trade embargo in 1962. Bush tightened some of those restrictions in recent years, most notably limiting travel to the island to once every three years for a limit of 14 days. Under the new provisions, relatives will be able to go once a year and stay for an unlimited time. In addition, the definition of relatives has been broadened to include uncles, aunts, nephews and nieces. The new measures also increase the amount of money visitors can spend. Otto Reich, who served presidents Reagan and both Bushes in a number of high-level Latin American posts, also testified Wednesday before the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Reich and Hakim have different perspectives on how far Obama should go on improving relations with Cuba, but they agree that attaching the latest measures to the spending bill was the wrong way to do it. ""It's important to open up Cuba, but it should be done systematically,"" Hakim told CNN. ""This is very important for the Cuban American community. It ought to be done with them at the table. If they're not involved, they're going to push back."" Initial opposition from two Democratic senators with large Cuban American communities in their states put the spending bill in jeopardy. Senators Bill Nelson of Florida and Bob Menendez of New Jersey voted for the budget Tuesday after receiving personal letters from Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner assuring them that the new provisions will not alter U.S. policy. Reich said he did not like the Cuba provisions in the budget because the United States gets nothing in return. ""I'm opposed to it because of the way it was done,"" he said. ""There's a way it can be done to advance the conditions of the people in Cuba. I don't approve of the unilateral way it's being done. The embargo is a negotiating tool. We should not negotiate with ourselves, and that's what we're doing."" Hakim warns that too much should not be read into the new measures, saying, ""The fact is that this is very minor."" Larry Birns, director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, said in a policy statement Wednesday that the new provision ""suffers from being too little and too late."" Similar measures have been attached to previous spending bills in the past eight years but Bush threatened to veto the legislation, so the language was scrapped. Senators Nelson and Menendez were most concerned with the provision that allows cash advance sales of agricultural and pharmaceutical products to Cuba. Before Bush, ""cash advance"" used to mean that money would have to be paid as soon as the goods reached Cuba. But the Bush Administration said ""cash advance"" had to mean money was sent before the cargo was loaded on ships in the United States for Cuba. The language in the new spending bill reverts the meaning to the previous ""cash-on-delivery"" method favored by U.S. farmers and exporters. Some members of Congress also were concerned the new provisions would allow credit sales, which would poke major holes in the economic embargo. But Geithner's letters to Nelson and Menendez assured them this would not happen. He did tell the senators, though, the Obama administration is reviewing its policies toward Cuba. CNN State Department Producer Elise Labott contributed to this report.","Three provisions are attached to $410 billion spending bill signed by Obama .

"(CNN) -- Country music artist Taylor Swift has told CNN she never dreamed she would shoot to stardom so quickly. At just 19 years old, she is one of the most successful recording artists of the decade in the United States. Her album ""Fearless"" is certified quadruple platinum, and her 60-date tour of the U.S., UK and Australia sold out in minutes. Talking to CNN's Becky Anderson, she said: ""I think for me the most satisfying thing is going out with my first headlining tour and having every show sell out. That was something that I never dreamed would be so quick to happen. ""Putting Madison Square Garden on sale and having it be sold out in 59 seconds. Like I can't believe that. I'm still completely blown away by that. ""And I think my parents are most proud of the moment when where we were all sitting in the crowd at the CMA Awards and they heard my name announced as entertainer of the year. ""I think my parents cried more for that moment than any other moment."" She has had two number one albums in the Billboard Charts, and in 2009, Swift became the first country music artist ever to win an MTV Video Music Award. Asked what she would have thought had someone told her 10 years ago that she would be famous by the age of 18, she said: ""I thought I was going to do what my parents did. They went to college. They went into business and I loved music and I never imagined that I would actually get to do that as a job. It's wonderful."" Asked why it is that her songs are considered country music, she said: ""I think that what categorizes country music, to me, in my head. I think a country song is when you are singing about being proud of your life. ""I sing about love and boys and that's my life. So that's what fascinates me, feelings, and so I think if you are singing and writing songs about the way that you live your life, that's a country song."" On reports that she is dating teen heartthrob Taylor Lautner, Swift said: ""He's a great guy and we're really close."" But she refused to be drawn on her thoughts about Kanye West, who cut her off as she accepted the award for Best Female Song at the MTV Music Video Awards ceremony. ""I just haven't really changed my mind and that I don't like to talk about it,"" she said.","Most satisfying thing is having every show in her tour sell out, she tells CNN .

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A suicide car bomb blast near a voter registration site killed 16 people, 14 of them children, and wounded 58 in southeastern Afghanistan on Sunday morning, according to a senior police official and the U.S. military. The U.S. military released this photo of the blast near a voter registration site. A Taliban spokesman said one of his group's fighters carried out the attack. When security guards stopped the car at the entrance to the Mandozai district headquarters, the driver detonated the explosives inside the car, Khost provincial security chief Mohammad Yaqoub said. A security guard and an Afghan National Army soldier were among the dead. There were no military casualties, said U.S. Col. Gregory Julian. Coalition and Afghan forces worked together to evacuate the wounded to military and civilian hospitals, he said. The military released photos of the incident, saying they ""provide further proof the Afghan militants are not interested in the welfare nor benefit of the Afghan people."" Dozens of tribal elders were meeting nearby in the district administrative office at the time of the bombing, the police official said. The Mandozai district is in the Khost province. Zabiullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman speaking by phone from an undisclosed location, said the suicide bombing was carried out by Qari Hameedullah, a Taliban fighter. Elsewhere, a rocket attack in Kabul killed three teenage sisters and injured four other people Saturday night, Afghan President Hamid Karzai's office said in a statement. The girls died when one of two rockets fired on Kabul crashed into a house in the southern part of the city. In the statement, Karzai called those who fired the rockets ""enemies of Afghanistan"" who ""can't achieve anything by firing rockets but the killing of innocent civilians."" The president called the suicide bombing an ""un-Islamic act"" and said those behind it ""are not aware of the Islamic teachings which outlaw the killing of innocent people. Those who ordered and executed this attack cannot escape the revenge of Afghans and God's punishment.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The Supreme Court offered unanimous support for police Wednesday by allowing drug evidence gathered after an arrest that violated state law to be used at trial, an important search-and-seizure case turning on the constitutional limits of ""probable cause."" The Supreme Court unanimously gave police broader powers to search for and seize evidence. ""When officers have probable cause to believe that a person has committed a crime in their presence, the Fourth Amendment permits them to make an arrest, and to search the suspect in order to safeguard evidence and ensure their own safety,"" Justice Antonin Scalia wrote. David Lee Moore was stopped by Portsmouth, Virginia, officers five years ago for driving his vehicle on a suspended license. Under state law in such incidents, only a summons is to be issued and the motorist is to be allowed to go. Instead, detectives detained Moore for almost an hour, arrested him, then searched him and found cocaine. At trial, Moore's lawyers tried to suppress the evidence, but the state judge allowed it, even though the court noted the arrest violated state law. A police detective, asked why the man was arrested, replied, ""Just our prerogative."" While some of the justices expressed concern about that level of discretion at oral arguments in January, their 9-0 ruling raised few such doubts. ""The arrest rules that the officers violated were those of state law alone,"" Scalia said. ""It is not the province of the Fourth Amendment to enforce state law."" The state had argued an arrest is constitutionally reasonable if officers have probable cause to believe a suspect has committed a crime. ""This standard represents the best compromise between the needs of the citizens and the duty of the government to combat crime,"" Stephen McCullough, Virginia's deputy solicitor general, had told the high court. But Moore's attorney, Thomas Goldstein, called an ""extreme proposition"" the idea that it would be reasonable ""to go out and arrest someone for a non-arrestable offense and not only do that, but having committed that trespass at common law, to further search them."" There has been widespread judicial confusion over how such police searches should be handled. Some lower courts had ruled that when state arrest law is violated, the Constitution provides a remedy in the suppression of any evidence resulting from the arrest and a related search. But the justices agreed with the majority of courts that said constitutional requirements are satisfied when an officer has probable cause to make an arrest, even if some provision of state law was violated in the process. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote a concurring opinion suggesting Virginia change its law to make driving on a suspended license an arrestable offense. During arguments, Ginsburg spoke for several colleagues when she pointed out that if a summons had been issued in Moore's case, any incriminating evidence would have been excluded. ""Would you explain the logic to saying that when the police violate state law, then the evidence can come in, but when they comply with state law, it can't,"" she asked. The ruling means Moore's original jury conviction and 3-½ year prison term will stand. E-mail to a friend .","Case involves Virginia man stopped for driving with suspended license .

"(CNN)  -- The family of a Chicago teenager whose beating death was caught on video hope that the attention the incident has garnered will spur healing locally, a relative said at a news conference Wednesday evening. Derrion Albert, 16, was beaten to death last week. His death was captured on video. ""It should've never happened, but it's never too late,"" said Rose Braxton, great-aunt of 16-year-old Derrion Albert. ""It's time for healing to start getting our communities together so this won't happen to anyone else's child ever again."" Four suspects have been charged with first-degree murder in the September 24 killing of Albert, and police say they are looking for three more people in connection with the beating captured on videotape. Prosecutors said that Albert, an honors student, was an innocent bystander who ended up in the middle of a street fight between two factions of students from Fenger High School. The incident caught the attention of the White House, too. The footage of the incident, which shows Albert being hit by a railroad tie, ""is ""chilling"" and one of the most shocking things ""you can ever see,"" White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Wednesday. President Obama's concern over the killing didn't provide additional comfort to the family, ""but I'm glad that it's out there so everyone can see it and they know that, yes, this is happening,"" Braxton said. ""This was vicious. How do you just come out and decide that you're going to attack someone with a two-by-four?"" Braxton said. She spoke to reporters together with area community and church leaders. ""Maybe this will wake up and shake up people,"" the Rev. Jesse Jackson said at the press conference, noting that three teens were killed in Chicago this week. Braxton said her message to the White House was simply, ""Do something."" ""We need to get to our children,"" she said. ""Why are they so angry, so full of venom, that you would even consider doing something like that to another human being?"" Albert's funeral was scheduled for Saturday at 10 a.m. at Greater Mount Hebron Baptist Church in Chicago. An amateur videotape shot by a witness, which has been broadcast widely, showed the attack unfolding. A local TV station that received the tape turned it over to police. When school let out at 2:50 p.m. on Thursday, Albert was on his way to a bus stop when two groups of students converged on the street, said Tandra Simonton, spokeswoman for the Cook County States Attorney. The factions, one that lived near the Altgeld Gardens housing development and one in an area known as ""The Ville,"" began fighting after an earlier shooting that police called gang-related. According to Simonton, Albert was approached by two members of ""The Ville"" faction and struck in the head with a long wooden railroad tie, then punched in the face. After being briefly knocked unconscious, Albert regained consciousness and tried to move from the fight, but was then attacked by a second group of five members from the opposing faction, Simonton said. Albert was taken to Roseland Community Hospital and then to Advocate Christ Hospital and Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead. Chicago Police Superintendent Jody Weis said he asked the U.S. Secret Service to try to enhance the video so that others involved in the fight can be identified. Weis pleaded with anyone who may have information not to withhold it. ""The culture of 'no-snitch' is unacceptable,"" he said. ""On Thursday, a young man with a promising future lost his life to senseless violence, yet few have come forward."" Authorities are also considering charging people who participated in the fight but did not come into contact with Albert, he said. Asked about the killing as Obama prepares to travel to Copenhagen, Denmark, to lobby the International Olympic Committee to award Chicago the 2016 Games, Gibbs described the videotape of the attack as ""among the most shocking that you can ever see."" ""The killing of an honor student ... who's beaten to death, is chilling, chilling video,"" Gibbs said. Obama has emphasized parental responsibility in addressing chronic problems in low-income urban communities including school dropouts, drug use, gang activity and violence. Gibbs offered no explanation for the Chicago killing, saying, ""in many ways a lot of these crimes are amazingly hard to explain."" Whatever led to this specific attack, ""you can't regulate the hard issue,"" Gibbs said. ""This is not a problem that government alone, as the president often says, at any level is going to be able to solve,"" Gibbs said. ""This is going to take community involvement, it's going to take parental involvement, it's going to take the involvement of everyone to address what is obviously a sad and shocking problem.""","Victim's great-aunt: Stop this from happening to ""anyone else's child ever again""

"(CNN) -- He is perhaps the most recognizable man in fashion, almost never seen without his dark glasses, a silver ponytail and fingerless gloves. And while the German-born fashion designer has been the creative force behind fashion house Chanel for more than a quarter of a century, he's still thriving on new ideas, designs and what the future may hold. ""I don't look back... Life is not something made by order, we have to fit in the pattern of what life is all about now, and I'm a person who fits easily into this kind of situation because I like change,"" he told CNN in Shanghai. While his own image is enduring, he is the creative force of  the Chanel fashion house, whose eponymous designer, Coco Chanel created some of the most iconic outfits of the 20th century. He may have upset the traditionalists when he first took over the reins, but for the forward-thinking Lagerfeld, it was not a concern. ""My job is to put in people's brain the idea what Chanel was all about, even if it was not about such a large choice of things... I pushed [Coco Chanel's] symbol, like the change of pearls, in a way much more than she did herself. I could play with everything and mix it with everything that's going on in fashion because fashion is about that. It's not retrospective, it has to be something you want to wear now,"" he said. As for the notoriously harsh world of fashion, Lagerfeld sees it merely as a reflection of the way the world works. ""This is a world with no pity or that you can complain, 'I couldn't do it because things are against me.' No, things are against nobody, if you have something to offer, or if you can be something,"" he said. ""If you want to be successful in the fashion world, as well as the movie world and music world, it's something else that you need, but you cannot decide that you have it. It's up to you to sew it, but it's up to the others to use it. In a way it's the worst of worlds, but if you made in the world, it's beyond pleasant."" Confident and unabashed Lagerfeld is looking forward to more creative inspiration and hard work. His contracts with Chanel and Fendi are for life. ""Chanel died doing her last collection in her 90s, so I have time. I don't think like this. It's my projection, always six months, six months, six months. I don't know. People laugh at me to disappear but I'm not ready for that one. ""I am born for the battlefield. Competition is healthy you know.

"(CNN) -- Iceland is losing its only three McDonald's restaurants as a result of the poor economic situation in the country. Businessman Magnus Ogmundsson, who owns the only McDonald's franchise in Iceland, said it had become too expensive to operate the restaurants after Iceland's currency, the krona, plunged in value. ""The krona is quite weak and we are buying everything in euros, and we have very high tariffs on imported agricultural products,"" he told CNN on Tuesday. In January 2008, it cost more than 95 Icelandic krona to buy one euro, according to the Central Bank of Iceland. Tuesday, that price had shot up to more than 186 krona. That means the currency is worth half as much today as it was in January 2008 -- and things priced in euros now cost twice as much to buy. Ogmundsson said the McDonald's Corporation worked with him to find a solution, but in the end he had no choice but to close. There was ""good cooperation"" with McDonald's, Ogmundsson told CNN. ""No hard feelings."" McDonald's said it had become financially prohibitive to continue operating in Iceland because of ""the unique operational complexity of doing business in Iceland combined with the very challenging economic climate in the country."" It said there are no plans to seek a new franchise partner in that country. The three stores will close at midnight Saturday, but they will reopen as an independent chain called Metro, with more domestic ingredients and fewer imported products. ""We believe we can be more successful with our own brand,"" Ogmundsson said. A McDonald's Big Mac hamburger currently sells for the equivalent of $5.29, making Iceland one of the most expensive places in the world to buy the sandwich. Only Norway and Switzerland charge more, according to the countries listed on the Economist magazine's Big Mac Index, published in February. A Big Mac costs about $3.54 in the United States, $2.19 in Australia, $5.07 in Denmark, $1.66 in South Africa, and $1.52 in Malaysia.","Iceland is losing its only three McDonald's restaurants after economic collapse .

"(CNN) -- A man accused of screaming racial slurs while beating an Army reservist in front of her daughter outside a restaurant in Morrow, Georgia, was jailed and held without bond Wednesday after being indicted on felony charges. Troy Dale West Jr, of Poulan, Georgia, is being held without bond on new felony charges. Troy Dale West Jr., of Poulan, Georgia, is facing one count of aggravated assault, two counts of battery, two counts of disorderly conduct, false imprisonment and cruelty to children for allegedly beating Tashawnea Hill outside a Cracker Barrel restaurant on September 9, according to a Clayton County Court online docket. West had been arrested on misdemeanor charges following the incident, but Clayton County District Attorney Tracy Graham Lawson took the the case to a grand jury asking for more serious charges. Hill's attorney Kip Jones told CNN that several hundred supporters, believed to be with the NAACP, Al Sharpton's Political Action Network and Rainbow Push, gathered outside the courtroom Wednesday morning in support of more serious charges against West. Jones said he and Hill were pleased with the new indictment. ""We look forward to a conviction as Tasha and her 7-year-old daughter move forward to recover from this heinous incident,"" he said. West's lawyer, Larry King, had no comment about the indictment, according his assistant. Hill, 35, said the attack occurred after she warned West to be careful after almost hitting her 7-year-old daughter with the restaurant's door as she was leaving. West, according to a police report, admitted striking Hill ""after she spit on me and accused me of trying to hit her daughter with a door."" During an interview on CNN following the attack, Jones denied that she spat on West or did ""anything to provoke the attack."" Hill, an African-American, told police that West, 47, yelled racial epithets at her during the attack. Police said witnesses confirmed her account. ""He did punch me with a closed fist repeated times. My head is still hurting today. I have knots on my head,"" Hill told CNN. She also said she was kicked. Police say Hill stated that ""West punched her in the left cheek, forehead, kicked her body in several places, and punched her head in many areas several times."" Hill's attorney said he was ""convinced this was a hateful, racist attack ... based on the N-word, the B-word, etc."" ""The language was vile. It was racist. It was sexist. It was completely offensive, completely unprovoked,"" Jones said. Morrow is a racially diverse city in the southeast suburbs of Atlanta, Georgia, with a population of about 4,900, according to the 2000 census.","Man accused of racially charged attack at restaurant held without bond .

"(Tribune Media Services) -- Gabriel Medina can't reach his hotel in New Orleans because there's a police barricade in front of it. A manager promises to ""help"" him cancel the reservation, but three days later, his credit card is charged $113. Now his credit card has sided with the hotel. Is there anything else he can do? Q: I don't know where else to turn. I recently booked a room at the Holiday Inn French Quarter-Chateau Lemoyne in New Orleans through its central reservations phone number. When I arrived, the New Orleans Police Department had the entire block closed off. I immediately called the hotel and told a manager I couldn't access the hotel. He said he did not know when the blockade would be lifted and couldn't help get my car or luggage to the hotel. He couldn't cancel my reservation because I had made it through Holiday Inn's central reservations number. After several more attempts to reach the hotel, he agreed to help me cancel my reservation. I stayed at another hotel that night. Three days later, a $113 charge appeared on my credit card from the Holiday Inn. I disputed the charge, but they told me I couldn't get a refund because I could not prove that they refused me the room. When I called guest relations they said they needed a cancellation number before they would consider a refund. Otherwise the hotel itself would need to reverse the charge. When I call the hotel, I get only voicemail. Can you help? -- Gabriel Medina, Elk Grove, California . A: If a hotel representative says your reservation is canceled, you shouldn't be charged for your stay. But a review of your correspondence raises a few red flags. First, a manager told you that it was impossible for him to cancel a reservation made through Holiday Inn's 800-number. Then, a few minutes later, the same manager agrees to ""help"" you cancel the reservation. I would assume that ""helping"" you means your reservation is officially canceled, but what if he just looked into it and then decided it couldn't be done, and left your original reservation intact? Since Holiday Inn didn't have a cancellation number, it probably means there was no cancellation. Here's what you did right: You noted the name of the manager with whom you spoke. You followed up with Holiday Inn, and you were persistent but polite. Here's what you overlooked: You should have called the central reservations number and asked for a cancellation number. If they refused to give you a number, you should have given a representative the name of the manager you spoke with. I would have followed up with the manager and not let Holiday Inn off the hook until you had a number. But getting a number isn't enough. Instead of continuing to call Holiday Inn, I would have sent it a short, cordial email asking for a verification of your cancellation in writing. If you send an email through a hotel company's Web site (Holiday Inn) you'll typically receive a meaningful answer in a matter of days, if not hours. With that information, your credit card dispute would have probably been a slam-dunk. Before getting to the resolution on your case, let me add one more thing. As far as I can tell, Holiday Inn was under no obligation to refund your money. You couldn't reach the hotel because of a police barricade, which the property couldn't control. But since a manager assured you that he would help you make a cancellation, I think it's reasonable to expect a refund. I contacted Holiday Inn on your behalf. It reviewed your case and apologized for the way in which your refund was handled. ""Clearly the inability to access the hotel was beyond your control, and in as such, you should be relieved of the $113 charge you have received,"" a representative wrote to you in a letter. You're getting your $113 back. Christopher Elliott is the ombudsman for National Geographic Traveler magazine. E-mail him at celliott@ngs.org.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- An extensive federal report released Monday concludes that roughly one in four of the 697,000 U.S. veterans of the 1990-91 Gulf War suffer from Gulf War illness. A U.S. soldier wears protection against chemical weapons during the Gulf War in a February 1991 photo. That illness is a condition now identified as the likely consequence of exposure to toxic chemicals, including pesticides and a drug administered to protect troops against nerve gas. The 452-page report states that ""scientific evidence leaves no question that Gulf War illness is a real condition with real causes and serious consequences for affected veterans."" The report, compiled by a panel of scientific experts and veterans serving on the congressionally mandated Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses, fails to identify any cure for the malady. It also notes that few veterans afflicted with Gulf War illness have recovered over time. ""Today's report brings to a close one of the darkest chapters in the legacy of the 1991 Gulf War,"" said Anthony Hardie, a member of the committee and a member of the advocacy group Veterans of Modern Warfare. ""This is a bittersweet victory, [because] this is what Gulf War veterans have been saying all along,"" Hardie said at a news conference in Washington. ""Years were squandered by the federal government ... trying to disprove that anything could be wrong with Gulf War veterans."" The committee's report, titled ""Gulf War Illness and the Health of Gulf War Veterans,"" was officially presented Monday to Secretary of Veterans Affairs James Peake. Noting that overall funding for research into Gulf War illness has declined dramatically since 2001, it calls for a ""renewed federal research commitment"" to ""identify effective treatments for Gulf War illness and address other priority Gulf War health issues.""  Watch CNN's Elizabeth Cohen report more on Gulf War illness » . According to the report, Gulf War illness is a ""complex of multiple concurrent symptoms"" that ""typically includes persistent memory and concentration problems, chronic headaches, widespread pain, gastrointestinal problems, and other chronic abnormalities."" The illness may also be potentially tied to higher rates of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) -- more commonly known as Lou Gehrig's Disease -- among Gulf War veterans than veterans of other conflicts. The illness is identified as the consequence of multiple ""biological alterations"" affecting the brain and nervous system. iReport.com: Do you know someone affected by Gulf War illness? While it is sometimes difficult to issue a specific diagnosis of the disease, it is, according to the report, no longer difficult to identify a cause. The report identifies two Gulf War ""neurotoxic"" exposures that ""are causally associated with Gulf War illness."" The first is the ingestion of pyridostigmine bromide (PB) pills, given to protect troops from effects of nerve agents. The second is exposure to dangerous pesticides used during the conflict. The report does not rule out other possible contributors to Gulf War illness -- including low-level exposure to nerve agents and close proximity to oil well fires -- though it fails to establish any clear link. The report concludes there is no clear link between the illness and a veteran's exposure to factors such as depleted uranium or an anthrax vaccine administered at the time. ""Gulf War illness isn't some imaginary syndrome,"" said Ken Robinson, the senior intelligence officer for the initial Department of Defense investigation into Gulf War illness in 1996-97. ""This is real, and it has devastated families. Now is the time to restore the funding cuts that have been made in the Veterans Administration. Our mission has to be to ensure that these veterans get help and become whole again."" Robinson noted that soldiers in the field today are not at risk for Gulf War illness, because the military is no longer using the PB pills or pesticides that led to the illness in 1990 and 1991. The report backs Robinson's conclusion, noting that no problem similar to Gulf War illness has been discovered among veterans from the conflict in Bosnia in the 1990s or in the current engagements in Afghanistan and Iraq. The committee report also backs Robinson's call for more effective treatments among veterans suffering from Gulf War illness. Noting that overall funding for research into Gulf War illness has declined dramatically since 2001, it calls for a ""renewed federal research commitment"" to ""identify effective treatments for Gulf War illness and address other priority Gulf War health issues."" Specifically, the report calls for at least $60 million in new annual federal funding on research committed to improving the health of Gulf War veterans.","NEW: Officer who investigated illness: ""This is real, and it has devastated families""

"(CNN) -- Peruvian authorities say they have arrested four members of a gang that specialized in selling to European labs fat obtained from dead humans. Officials are investigating the disappearance of at least 60 people they believe were killed by gang members in two mountainous states in central Peru, lead prosecutor Jorge Sanz Quiroz said Friday. The four suspects have been charged with murder in the September slaying of a Peruvian man, the prosecutor said. ""They killed to obtain human fat because there were European laboratories that would pay them,"" Sanz Quiroz said. The suspects told authorities they were paid $15,000 for a liter (about 1 quart) of human fat. Officials did not disclose what possible use laboratories could have for the human fat, but fat can be a component of cosmetics and is used in reconstructive or cosmetic surgery. The use of human fat for any purpose is extremely rare, however, physicians say. Other suspects, including the Peruvian ringleader, have eluded capture, Sanz Quiroz said. Authorities have the names of two Italian suspects who are being sought by Interpol, the 188-nation worldwide police agency, the prosecutor said. He declined to reveal their identities. Sanz Quiroz acknowledged the uniqueness of the allegations. ""We are not making this up,"" he said. ""They have confessed to this. That's what's coming out now."" One of the suspects told officials he had been committing the murders for five years. According to a criminal complaint Sanz Quiroz filed November 18, officials discovered on September 22 a small container containing a fat-like substance that had been stored at the Bella Durmiente bus station in Lima, Peru's capital. On November 3, the complaint says, suspect Serapio Marcos Veramendi Principe was arrested after he retrieved three bottles from the Estrella Polar bus station. The bottles contained a substance authorities believe is human fat, the complaint says. Lab tests are being performed to determine what the substance is. Authorities identified the three other suspects as Elmer Segundo Castillejos Aguero, Hilario Cudena Simon and Enedina Estela Claudio. The suspects identified each other for police in photo lineups, the complaint says. In addition to murder, Veramendi Principe and Castillejos Aguero face weapons charges. Castillejos Aguero, Veramendi Principe and Estela Claudio also face drug charges, authorities said. They are accused in the September 16 killing of Abel Matos Aranda, the criminal complaint says. Authorities believe the substance found at the bus stations is body fat obtained from Matos Aranda. Officials unearthed a partially buried male body November 13 in Huanuco state. They believe it was Matos Aranda. Sanz Quiroz referred to the suspects as ""brujos,"" the Spanish word for witches. He noted that the suspects are part of an Andean mountain culture that believes bodies can be used to ward off evil and prevent disasters. For example, he said, bodies are often buried at the entrances to mine shafts and bridges in the belief they will keep the structures from collapsing. Authorities are calling the suspects ""pishtacos,"" which are Andean mythological creatures. In his 1996 book ""Death in the Andes,"" Peruvian author Mario Vargas Llosa mentions pishtacos extensively, saying they are half-white ghouls who live in caves, lurk along dark isolated roads and suck the fat out of anyone careless enough to travel Andean roads at night. Andean myth holds that the fat is used to make soaps, lubricants, healing potions and cosmetic creams. Until the arrests, few believed that anything resembling pishtacos existed. ""It's an Andean myth that we've now been able to prove,"" said Miguel Jimenez Torres, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office. Some physicians say human fat is used in some medical procedures, but a few products were taken off the market because they were considered unsafe. The longevity of implants that use human tissue often is not as good, said Atlanta cosmetic surgeon Harold Brody. Nor is there any advantage, he said, to using human fat in cosmetic creams or lotions. ""They're a little behind the times,"" Brody said. ""It makes a great moisturizer, but it has no advantages over good moisturizers that don't use human fat."" New York dermatologist Barry Goldman said he had never heard of human fat being sold on the black market. ""The idea that anybody would use an injectable where you didn't know where it came from would be laughable if it weren't unethical and potentially dangerous,"" he said. Still, the notion of black market human fat seemed possible to him. ""They steal kidneys, so why not this?"" he asked. ""It is sick, but in the Holocaust they did use skin for lamps.""","Peruvian authorities reported to have arrested gang who are selling human fat .

"(CNN)  -- In the same way a Christmas playlist is incomplete without a tipsy, eggnog-drinking grandmother having an unfortunate accident with reindeer, the melodrama of certain shows and films improves when a boozy grandmother is written in. The minor role is normally reserved for television, but it makes the jump to movie theaters this year in ""The Lovely Bones,"" Peter Jackson's cerebral thriller based on Alice Sebold's 2002 novel, with Susan Sarandon playing the hard-drinking Grandma Lynn. ""She's such a strange grandmother,"" Sarandon told the Australian press about her first role as a family matriarch. Although Sarandon, 63, said she's old enough to play one, her Grandma Lynn isn't ""a granny grandmother."" ""She's the comic relief in this very deep, very hard movie; she comes in and the movie gets lighter,"" said movie reviewer Kit Bowen. ""She's trying to vacuum while ash is falling from her cigarette."" Television critics say it's hard to nail down when this character first made an appearance, but the anti-grandmother role we know today was more than likely inspired by the spirited older women on ""Golden Girls,"" and has since become a television staple. Kelly Bishop played a version of the difficult, drinking grandmother for seven seasons as Emily Gilmore on ""Gilmore Girls,"" and Holland Taylor has taken her vodka neat as Evelyn Harper on ""Two and a Half Men"" and as Peggy Peabody on ""The L Word."" The Upper East Side hour-long melodrama ""Gossip Girl"" has the scheming Celia Rhodes -- whose signature scent is Chanel No. 5 with a top note of gin -- and Jessica Walter has perfected the role as Lucille Bluth on ""Arrested Development"" and Tabitha Wilson on ""90210."" ""These women, they're not knitting -- they're more interested in mixing their drinks than watching kids,"" said Entertainment Weekly's pop culture writer Tim Stack. ""They're more inclined to offer a witticism or a barb than to give you sweet advice. These ladies aren't cooking -- I don't think they even eat. They drink their lunch. And their dinners. And their breakfasts. ... Maybe they eat the olives."" They're the exact opposite of the stereotypical grandmother, said TVGuide.com's senior editor Mickey O'Connor. ""They're supposed to be the truth-tellers -- whether it's liquid courage or lowering their inhibitions, I don't know,"" O'Connor said. ""But everyone can relate to having an older relative that embarrasses you to some degree,"" he added. ""Shelley Long just did a drunken grandma on 'Modern Family.' There was a wedding scene where she got drunk, gave a toast and ended up kicking the cake over. It's about the universality of how we deal with our older relatives. If you make them drunk, there's some way to at least codify what embarrasses us about them, or to excuse their outrageous behavior."" With O'Connor's own grandparents, though, ""it's less often an indication of how much they've had to drink and more often just who they are."" Because it's a role that's virtually paint-by-numbers -- drunk grandmothers are nearly always wealthy, white and cruelly witty, with poor parenting skills -- it demands a strong actress who can keep the potentially two-dimensional from falling flat. Case in point for film reviewer Bowen is the difference between the Grandma Lynn in Sebold's novel and Jackson's cinematic version. ""I loved the book, but the funny thing is that I don't remember the grandmother,"" Bowen said. ""She definitely is more memorable in the movie, and I'm glad her character is in the movie because it adds another layer to it. ""Which, of course, has everything to do with Susan Sarandon,"" Bowen added. The talent of the women who have taken these minor roles and turned them into iconic characters is what has kept the ""drunk grandma"" role from veering into cliché territory, O'Connor said. ""Even with the criticisms people had of '90210,' they liked Jessica Walter and what she was doing,"" O'Connor said. ""She brought some reality. The teen drama tends to be a little stylized in terms of its emotional truth, and she's kind of there to cut through the artifice."" Stack, who also lists Walter's ""Development"" character as one of his favorites, thinks these roles are always such a hit because, regardless of what series they land in, they always manage to ""punch it up."" (Need proof of Walter's comedic timing? Do a search for ""Lucille Bluth Chicken Dance"" on YouTube.) ""They're the Tabasco to a Bloody Mary,"" Stack said. ""Walter was sharp, funny, mean and heartless --- and at the same time, she was fabulous in a Chanel suit like it was always happy hour somewhere. She made it look like such a blast."" While their alcohol-induced shenanigans are obviously trumped up for comedic effect, the idea of a grandmother who's independent, technologically savvy and having fun isn't the foreign notion it used to be, said Mary McHugh, the 81-year-old author of ""How Not to Become a Little Old Lady."" McHugh herself has spent her post-child-rearing years traveling the world. ""When people think of a grandmother, their eyes glaze over. But now, many of us are doing things we love doing. We're not sitting somewhere and rocking in a rocking chair,"" said McHugh, who herself enjoys a glass of wine or two to cap off her evenings. But, despite the truth that these characters are reflected in the real world more than ever, television and film still doesn't have anything close to the godmother of the grandmother character, ""Golden Girls."" ""Hopefully, it's not the drunk grandmother [character] that have made it better for older actresses, but you never know,"" O'Connor said. ""Maybe it's become, play a drunk grandmother and you get to work past the age of 60.""","Susan Sarandon plays hard-drinking Grandma Lynn in ""The Lovely Bones""

"(CNN) -- Four suspects are sought in connection with the shooting death over the weekend of a Houston, Texas, doctor, Austin County authorities said Monday. Dr. Jorge Mario Gonzales was found shot to death at his ranch in rural Texas on Saturday, police say. Dr. Jorge Mario Gonzalez, 56, was chief of the critical care section at Houston's Methodist Hospital and ""a pulmonary medicine leader,"" according to the hospital system's Web site. He was found dead Saturday when deputies responded to a 911 call of a burglary in progress shortly after noon, said Austin County Sheriff's Office spokesman Sgt. Paul Faircloth. The responding officer was met by vehicles leaving the location, Faircloth said, and a person in one vehicle fired on the officer. The officer and his car were not struck, and the officer did not return fire, Faircloth said. The officer was able to provide a detailed description of the vehicles, he said. At the home, which Faircloth said is in a rural, wooded and isolated area, officers found Gonzalez shot to death and another person wounded. The second victim was airlifted to an Austin, Texas, hospital.  Watch Dr. Gonzalez's son talk about his father » . Gonzalez's wife and small child were found unharmed inside the home, Faircloth said. CNN affiliate KHOU identified the woman as Charleen Gonzalez, 29, and the couple's 2-year-old son, and reported the two hid in a closet. Authorities do not know whether the incident was a burglary or an intended home invasion, Faircloth said, and ""we do not know if this is random or targeted."" Several leads were being followed Monday morning, he said, and numerous agencies were involved in the investigation. The motive for the killing had not been determined on Monday. The slaying took place at Gonzalez's ranch outside Bellville, Texas, said Lisa Block, spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Public Safety. Gonzalez, his wife and child arrived at the ranch about 11 a.m. Saturday, she said, and ""the suspects were at the house when they arrived."" Gonzalez's wife ran inside with the child and called 911, she said. Ranch worker Noel Galvan was the second victim, Block said. He was listed in critical condition, she said. Faircloth said earlier Monday five suspects were being sought, but later said police were seeking four. The vehicles seen leaving the home were a late '90s white Ford F-150 pickup, occupied by two Hispanic males, Faircloth said, and a red Honda or Acura with dark tinted windows sitting low to the ground, with one Hispanic male inside. The shots were fired from the white pickup, he said. Another vehicle mentioned earlier Monday was a two-toned silver and black Ford F-150 that had two Hispanic males inside. Faircloth said Monday afternoon that vehicle had been located and was not thought to be involved. However, police released a video of a gray Lexus on Monday, and would like to question its owners, Faircloth said. The drivers are believed to be an older couple. The car was seen before the officer encountered the white and red vehicles. ""The manhunt continues on the ground,"" Faircloth said. The suspects are considered armed and dangerous, he said. Faircloth said he had no information on whether the home had surveillance equipment. Family members told KHOU that Gonzalez went to the ranch nearly every weekend. ""It's deeply saddening for all of us,"" an older son of Gonzalez, Juan Mauricio Gonzalez, told KHOU. ""We are a tight-knit family and he was just a perfect man, a perfect father and a great physician."" The Methodist Hospital System said Gonzalez will be missed, ""both as a friend and an outstanding clinician and researcher. Our prayers and thoughts go out to his family during this tragedy."" ""This man had nothing to do with anybody,"" Juan Gonzalez told KHOU. ""He was a peaceful man. He was a wise man. He was just here to make people better and nothing else."" A reward totaling $26,000 was offered for information in the case leading to an arrest.

"(CNN) -- His shooting spree left at least 10 dead and millions terrified of bullets coming from an unseen sniper. But Mildred Muhammad believes she was the ultimate target of her ex-husband, John Allan Muhammad, the man dubbed the ""D.C. Sniper."" And for some time, Muhammad said she felt extreme guilt for the victims that were gunned down in grocery store parking lots and gas stations. The youngest was a 13-year-old boy who was shot while walking to his Maryland school. Muhammad spoke about the guilt she felt after the killing spree on CNN's ""Larry King Live"" on Monday night, the day before her ex-husband was scheduled to be executed. Muhammad said she has gradually gotten over her guilty feelings and focused on her three children. ""I felt that way initially because I had done everything I knew how to do to bring attention to how dangerous he was to me,"" Muhammad said. ""I had no idea his anger would extend beyond me, to include all people in his killings."" John Muhammad, the mastermind behind the Washington-area sniper attacks of 2002, is scheduled to die by lethal injection Tuesday evening at a state prison near Jarratt, Virginia. During two lengthy trials -- including one featuring testimony from young accomplice Lee Boyd Malvo -- and in several years of legal appeals, John Muhammad has continued to profess his innocence. Prosecutors say John Muhammad intended the killings to provide a smokescreen to cover up his real goal -- killing his ex-wife Mildred and gaining custody of his three children. Muhammad said she divorced John Muhammad because of abuse and has not visited him since he was in prison. ""I feel that all of my efforts, all of my energy is to help my children through this emotional turmoil that they are going through,"" said Muhammad. ""I don't have an emotional attachment to John."" John Muhammad's other ex-wife, Carol Williams, also talked to King Monday. Williams, John Muhammad's first wife, said she plans to visit him in prison with their son Tuesday before the execution. Williams also brought letters that John Muhammad wrote her from prison. ""Carol, I have missed my family for the past eight years. I don't want to be missed the day that these devils murder my innocent black (expletive),"" John Muhammad wrote in one of the letters. Williams said she was not surprised that John Muhammad still believed he was innocent. ""I'm praying for myself, for my son, and also for the families of the victims,"" Williams said.","John Muhammad's second ex-wife, Mildred, believes she was ultimate target of sniper spree .

"BEVERLY HILLS, California (CNN) -- Here's what happens when you go to interview Aretha Franklin: Her publicist will e-mail the cell phone number of her security man to your BlackBerry. Once you reach the lobby of the Four Seasons in Beverly Hills, you call the cell phone. Someone will come down to get you and bring you up to her suite, where you'll be greeted by Carlton, her longtime makeup artist. Aretha Franklin was voted the No. 1 singer of all time in a Rolling Stone survey. Then you look around, and you notice Aretha -- the Queen of Soul and recipient of 18 Grammys -- is quietly padding around the room in jeans, a turquoise T-shirt and flip-flops. She'll offer you ""a seat and Cokes"" -- then proceed to shoot the breeze, while you and your camera crew invade her room to set up for the interview. Then it hits you. You may be an Aretha Franklin groupie, but Aretha is a groupie of CNN. She loves to talk politics, and she's up-to-the-minute in terms of information. President-elect Barack Obama is her man. After seeing his keynote address at the Democratic National Convention in 2004, she invited him to be her honored guest at an event in her hometown of Detroit, Michigan. He couldn't come, but she's been a loyal supporter since then. She'll sing at his inauguration in January. In the meantime, Rolling Stone magazine, in a poll of music industry heavyweights, just named her the No. 1 singer of all time. And there's her new holiday album, ""This Christmas, Aretha."" In a career that's spanned more than 50 years, it's the first seasonal CD she's ever made. Aretha helps us set the stage for Santa (eggnog optional). Aretha Franklin: The snow is lightly falling -- you get the picture -- you're by the fireside with your sweetie, and no Aretha! There's no Aretha in the music! What's going on?! So I had to do an album. CNN: You've been wanting to do a holiday album for a long time. Franklin: For many years, I've wanted to do one, and I've always mentioned it to the chieftains, and they would say things like, ""Oh well. Christmas albums don't sell,"" and things like that. But that's not the point. Christmas albums are important. The music is important. The season is important. CNN: On ""This Christmas, Aretha,"" there are some traditional songs and some more contemporary tunes. Franklin: We did ""Silent Night,"" ""Angels We Have Heard on High,"" ""14 Angels"" -- which comes from the classic ""Hansel and Gretel,"" the opera. What else did we do? ""This Christmas"" by Donny Hathaway and ""Christmas Ain't Christmas (Without The One You Love)"" by the O'Jays. Those two are my favorites. They're the first two records that are going to play in the Franklin household every Christmas. CNN: What was Christmas like for you growing up? Franklin: Christmases past, my sister, Carolyn, and I -- we'd been waiting for Santa all night. Nothing! Where is this man? And we're looking all up in the sky all night long, until I guess about 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning. Finally, we just fell out. We couldn't take it anymore. [We'd wake up in the morning and] come downstairs, and everything was under the tree! We couldn't believe it! Where did these things come from? You know, we just couldn't believe it. CNN: Did you believe in Santa Claus for a long time? Franklin: For a while, I did. And then I started getting the idea that it wasn't Santa -- it was Dad. CNN: What's Christmas like now? Do you cook, or do you have someone help you cook? Franklin: Oh absolutely, puh-leeze! Nobody else better cook on the holidays except me! I do everything -- the traditional fare. You have the turkey, the baked ham with the brown sugar glaze. We have the mixed greens, we have fried corn, we have the sweet potato pies, you have the potato salad -- the whole nine yards is on the table. Everything is from scratch. Men don't like eating out of cans. And I don't like eating out of cans too much, either. CNN: Have you ever done a cookbook? Franklin: No, I haven't, but I plan to. CNN: Do you gather 'round the piano and sing Christmas carols? Franklin: After dinner, we do. We sing a little bit. We might be playing cards, we might be playing Monopoly. The children are just running in and out of the rooms, and up and down the steps. They love the workout room. CNN: How many people do you generally have over? Franklin: Usually, about 15 or so. My neighbors, my friends and family. My nieces, my grandchildren. CNN: On election night, I hear you all got together to watch the presidential returns. Franklin: We had an Obama pajama party -- and it was really cool -- at one of the casinos in Detroit. We sat there and watched the returns. Started at 6 o'clock, and we had like three or four screens going -- and, of course, we had CNN going, and I'm not just sayin' that because I'm sitting here. At that magic moment, the room just erupted. It was like, ""Whoa!"" All of the screaming and just -- I can imagine what people thought outside in the hallways! CNN: Did you ever think you'd see a black man elected president in your lifetime? Franklin: Absolutely. Absolutely, I did, yes -- after Reverend [Jesse] Jackson made his run, and Shirley Chisholm, so long before. I thought maybe even Colin Powell might run after Reverend Jackson. I did. CNN: Do you already have your dress for the inauguration? Franklin: Honey, I've had my dress for months! CNN: I hope you have a hotel reservation -- otherwise, you'll be begging for a bed at a youth hostel. Franklin: Oh, no. I don't stay at those places. CNN: You want a job in Barack's Cabinet? Franklin: Yeah, I want a job in Barack's Cabinet. How about a job, Mr. Obama? Please?! PLEASE?!! (She cracks up.)","Aretha Franklin's new holiday album is ""This Christmas, Aretha""

"Washington (CNN) -- A federal advisory board's recommendation that women in their 40s should avoid routine mammograms is not government policy and has caused ""a great deal of confusion,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said Wednesday. ""My message to women is simple. Mammograms have always been an important life-saving tool in the fight against breast cancer, and they still are today,"" Sebelius said in a statement. ""Keep doing what you have been doing for years: talk to your doctor about your individual history, ask questions and make the decision that is right for you."" With her statement, Sebelius waded into the controversy over Monday's announcement by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force that women in their 40s should not get routine mammograms for early detection of breast cancer. Sebelius' statement is aimed at ""making it clear these recommendations are not ours,"" a White House source said. The report ""shouldn't be dismissed,"" Sebelius said on CNN's ""The Situation Room."" But she added, ""There are other groups who have disagreed with this information."" The task force is ""making recommendations, not coverage decisions, not payment decisions."" Government health programs such as Medicaid will continue to cover routine mammograms, she said. ""We will continue to recommend it, and the health plans have indicated that they will do the same,"" Sebelius said. ""If the health care provider recommends a mammogram for a patient, they intend to cover that payment."" Though the Preventive Services Task Force is independent, the Department of Health and Human Services' Web site calls the panel's recommendations the ""gold standard,"" and insurance companies look to the panel for guidance on which preventive care practices they should cover. With the Obama administration fighting to push a sweeping overhaul of U.S. health insurance through Congress, Republicans quickly jumped at the chance to attack the mammography report. ""This is how rationing begins,"" said Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tennessee. ""This is the little toe in the edge of the water. And this is where you start getting a bureaucrat between you and your physician."" The White House disputes that, saying the recommendations ""cannot be used to deny treatment"" on their own. Sebelius said the task force won't make coverage decisions. ""Mammograms have been a huge step forward for millions of American women, but we still have about 21 million women and girls in America who don't have a doctor, who don't receive any kind of mammogram screening on any kind of basis regardless of their age,"" she said. ""The health reform debate is about closing that gap."" Criticism of the recommendation has come from quarters other than opponents of the Democratic health care bills. The American Cancer Society said it disagrees with the findings of the task force and continues to recommend annual screening, including mammograms, for all women beginning 40 and over. ""With its new recommendations, the [task force] is essentially telling women that mammography at age 40 to 49 saves lives, just not enough of them,"" said Dr. Otis Brawley, the group's chief medical officer. And Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, D-Florida, who was diagnosed with early stage breast cancer at 41, called the panel's recommendations ""really disturbing"" and ""absolutely irresponsible."" ""It's a very patronizing attitude that these scientists have taken,"" she said. ""It's pretty outrageous to suggest that women couldn't handle more information."" Rep. Frank Pallone Jr., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce's Subcommittee on Health, has announced that he will lead hearings into the advisory board's recommendations. Wasserman-Schultz said those hearings ""will help us reach the appropriate policy conclusion, which I believe is that these recommendations should be set aside."" Breast cancer is the most common cancer for U.S. women, with nearly 200,000 women expected to be diagnosed with the invasive form of the disease this year, according to the American Cancer Society. For women 50 to 74, it recommended routine mammography screenings every two years. Risks and benefits for women age 75 and older are unknown, it said. While roughly 15 percent of women in their 40s detect breast cancer through mammography, data show that many other women experience false positives, anxiety, and unnecessary biopsies as a result of the test, according to the task force. The Preventive Services Task Force reviews medical data and bases recommendations on effectiveness and risks involved. It is composed of 16 health care experts, none of whom are oncologists, though a team of cancer experts presented its findings to the group. CNN's Danielle Dellorto and Gloria Borger contributed to this report.","Secretary Kathleen Sebelius says findings aren't part of government policy .

"(CNN) -- Hurricane Ida moved into the southern Gulf of Mexico Sunday, prompting a declaration of emergency in Louisiana and concern along the U.S. Gulf Coast. The storm regained hurricane intensity overnight Saturday, becoming a Category 2 hurricane, but forecasters said it is expected to weaken as it moves north. Ida drenched Nicaragua after making landfall last week as a Category 1 hurricane, then weakened to a tropical storm before resuming strength. In El Salvador, at least 91 people died in flooding and mudslides, according to the government, but a low-pressure system out of the Pacific -- not Hurricane Ida -- triggered the disaster, forecaster Robby Berg of the National Hurricane Center said Sunday. A hurricane warning, meaning hurricane conditions are possible within 24 hours, extends from Pascagoula, Mississippi to Indian Pass, Florida, forecasters said. From Grande Isle, Louisiana, to west of Pascagoula, Mississippi, a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch are in effect. This area includes New Orleans, which the center earlier excluded from the watch, and Lake Pontchartrain, the hurricane center said. In anticipation of the storm's arrival, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal declared a state of emergency Sunday afternoon. Hurricane Ida ""threatens the safety and security of those citizens"" along the state's southeast coastline, he wrote in the declaration. The declaration gives the director of the governor's office of emergency preparedness authority ""to undertake any activity authorized by law which he deems necessary and appropriate"" to prepare for the possibility of a hurricane. Track Ida's progress, potential path . Alabama's Baldwin County commission urged that residents living in mobile homes, coastal communities or low-lying, flood-prone areas voluntarily evacuate. The county is under a local state of emergency and opened a shelter, according to a Sunday night statement from the county commission. As of 10 p.m. ET Sunday, Ida had maximum sustained winds near 105 mph (165 km/hr) with higher gusts. But the storm was expected to weaken on Monday and possibly begin losing tropical characteristics on Tuesday, the hurricane center said. The center of Ida was located about 400 miles (645 km) south-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River, forecasters said. It was moving north-northwest at nearly 14 mph (22 km/hr) and was expected to increase in speed. The storm was expected to be near coastal areas of the northern Gulf by Monday night or early Tuesday, the hurricane center said. As Ida moves in the Gulf of Mexico, conditions are expected to be unfavorable for any additional development, said CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen. Ida is expected to weaken because of a combination of wind shear, cooler water temperatures and the storm's interaction with a strong frontal system pushing off the Gulf Coast, he said. But Ida is forecast to remain a hurricane as it moves in the northern Gulf toward the U.S. coast, the center said. Florida's Division of Emergency Management asked residents to have disaster plans in place. ""Whether Ida maintains a storm or loses tropical characteristics, the Florida Gulf Coast region has the potential to see several inches of rain, strong winds, isolated tornadoes and dangerous surf and coastal flooding beginning Monday evening and continuing into Wednesday,"" the office said in a statement. The area stretching from Indian Pass, Florida, to Aucilla River, Florida, is also under a tropical storm warning. Tropical storm conditions are possible within 24 hours, the center said. Ida could drop between 1 and 3 inches of rain on portions of western Cuba, with isolated amounts of 8 inches possible in some spots, forecasters said. The central and eastern areas of the Gulf Coast northward to eastern Tennessee Valley and southern Appalachian Mountains could see 3 to 5 inches of rain with some areas getting as much as 8 inches, the center said. Ida is the Atlantic region's ninth named storm. The Atlantic hurricane season ends November 30. CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras and journalist Merlin Delcid in El Salvador contributed to this report.","Louisiana governor declares emergency after watch issued for parts of Gulf Coast .

"Washington (CNN) -- Fearlessly demonstrating the majesty of U.S. justice or acquiescing to terrorists by giving them undeserved rights and a public platform? The decision to bring Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, admitted mastermind of the September 11, 2001, attacks, and four other suspects to a New York courtroom, rather than a military tribunal, was described in stark contrasts Sunday by officials on opposing sides of the political spectrum. Democrats hailed Attorney General Eric Holder's decision to try the men in a civilian court as a demonstration of America's might and moral certainty, while Republicans called it a bad idea based on politics rather than pragmatism. ""We have a judicial system that's the envy of the world,"" Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, said on the CBS program ""Face the Nation."" ""I don't think we should run and hide and cower. Let's use our system."" But Republican Sen. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, speaking on the CNN program ""State of the Union,"" questioned why foreigners who allegedly are terrorists at war with the United States should be given full judicial rights of U.S. citizens. ""These people are evil people,"" Gregg said of the defendants. ""They represent a cause which wants to destroy this nation. If they have the opportunity and were to get free, they would try to destroy this country. There's no reason we should have them in the criminal justice system."" Former New York Major Rudy Giuliani, considered a possible GOP presidential candidate in 2012, called military tribunals created for terrorism suspects who have been held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, a better option than a civilian court. Military tribunals are ""a better choice for the government,"" Giuliani said on ""Fox News Sunday."" ""This choice of New York is a better choice for the terrorists. Why would you seek to give the terrorists a better choice than you're giving the public?"" In a separate interview on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" Giuliani said a New York court trial would cause unnecessary stress and expense for the city's police force. ""Anyone that tells you that this doesn't create additional security problems, of course, isn't telling you the truth,"" Giuliani said. ""And the best indication of it is, just look at the additional security that's going to be employed when this happens. That also happens to cost millions and millions and millions of dollars."" Rep. Peter Hoekstra of Michigan, the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, warned that bringing the suspects to New York raised the risk of further attacks on the United States. ""Why move them into the United States while we are still under the threat from radical jihadists?"" Hoekstra asked on the CBS program. However, Democratic Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island said on ""Fox News Sunday"" that scores of terrorism suspects were successfully prosecuted in civilian courts under the Bush Administration. ""What was a statesmanlike decision by the Bush administration can't be a political decision by this administration,"" Reed said. Holder announced the decision on the trial Friday. He said he expected all five suspects to be tried together and for prosecutors to seek the death penalty. The trial would be open to the public, although some portions that deal with classified information may be closed, Holder said.","Democrats: Decision is a demonstration of America's might and moral certainty .

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- In the aftermath of Haiti's devastating earthquake, a small radio station became an informational lifeline for people in Port-au-Prince and beyond. The radio station, Signal FM, managed to stay on the air during the earthquake, leaving music playing while its employees fled the building. The station's studios and broadcasting tower withstood the 7.0-magnitude quake, and with electricity provided by multiple generators, it became one of the few places stunned Haitians could turn for information and directions in the following days. ""We say that the only way communicate with the people and the world to is to stay on,"" station manager Mario Viau told CNN. ""And we stayed on."" Signal FM has stayed on the air throughout the nearly two weeks since the quake, though occasionally broadcasting at reduced power. At first, it had only three days of fuel to keep its generators going, but the Haitian government and private organizations contributed more.  Interactive map of where to find aid, hospitals in Haiti . Viau said he went on the air shortly after the earthquake, telling listeners ""that we have been hit by an earthquake, and, you know ... say the radio station is there. We gonna talk to you."" The station quickly organized a panel discussion with reporters, talking about what happened and getting dire reports from the surrounding city. ""People would come, and say I have this problem ... people are dead this way, why don't you send somebody that way. That was the first day,"" Viau said. ""The second day, they were saying we need water there, we need doctor there, we need food there. That's how it started."" The station's broadcast signal reaches about 3 million people around Port-au-Prince. And it has international reach via the Internet, allowing people to get messages to relatives all over the world. ""Somebody would call and say if you're alive, come in front of Signal FM [and] I'll meet you at this time,"" Viau said. Others have used it to inform search-and-rescue workers about sites where people may still be buried alive, as well as food and water distribution sites. People now bring letters and notes to the station to be read on air. One woman went on the air, out of desperation, to ask for help in finding her husband. When it worked, Viau got the bear-hug of a lifetime from the man. ""You should have seen him. He was almost choking me,"" Viau said. Radio is a powerful tool in a country with a literacy rate of about 62 percent, according to UNICEF. And with tens of thousands of people now living in tents or makeshift shelters, aid agencies have been distributing portable radios to keep them in touch.  CNN iReport:  Looking for loved ones in Haiti . The U.S. Army has been handing out solar-powered and hand-cranked radios to an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 Haitians now housed at a former golf course in the Port-au-Prince suburb of Petionville. The military will be broadcasting on three different radio stations. ""We'll pull people out of the audience and we'll ask, what's one thing you want to know and what's going on out there, that we don't know,"" said 1st Lt. Jeff Wozencraft of the Army's 82nd Airborne Division. The tents and tarps sprawling across the Petionville green has been sectioned off into communities, with an area to buy food and clothing, and even to get a haircut. Some vendors use car batteries to charge cell phones for 50 cents a pop. One of the tens of thousands now housed here is 22-year-old Louis Richardson, whose mother, father, brothers and sisters died in the quake. Taking shelter under a tree from the stifling heat, he told CNN that Signal FM is ""the most important source of information now."" But as he spoke, he wasn't listening to news. He was listening to ""You Are Not Alone"" by Michael Jackson.

"Mecca, Saudi Arabian (CNN) -- A teenager and three elderly people in Saudi Arabia for the hajj pilgrimage have died of the H1N1 flu virus, the Saudi Health Ministry said. The victims of the virus were a 17-year-old Nigerian female and a Sudanese man, an Indian man and a Moroccan woman who each were 75 years old. ""These cases were discovered too late,"" said Dr. Khaled Al-Marghalani, the ministry spokesman. ""Some were old, and the others had pre-existing chronic conditions."" Al-Marghalani said the Sudanese man initially went to a doctor who treated him, but not for H1N1. ""So when his doctor sent him to the hospital, and he was treated for H1N1, it was too late,"" he said. The annual pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, is required of Muslims at least once in their lives, and millions of people around the globe make the trek to attend. This year, the hajj begins Wednesday, and many pilgrims have been arriving days and weeks ahead of the event, which coincides with flu season. When Arab health ministers met in Cairo, Egypt, a few months back, it looked like several groups might even be banned from this year's event because of the flu. They were children under 12, adults over 65, pregnant women and people with chronic illnesses. The Saudis didn't ban anybody from coming and left the responsibility to the pilgrims' countries of origin. In effect, officials issued guidelines only for people at risk. Two days ago, Saudi Arabia's health minister, Dr. Abdullah Al-Rabeeah, gathered representatives to discuss efforts to detect the ailment. ""It would be nice to have more time to prepare [for the possibility of H1N1 spreading in Saudi Arabia] ahead of the hajj, but I am very satisfied with all the measures taken and have great confidence,"" he said before the meeting. Al-Marghalani said the ""safe weapon"" for the kinds of H1N1 cases that resulted in the deaths is Tamiflu, the drug used to fight influenza. ""If we lose Tamiflu, we will lose the war. But Tamiflu is only effective in the first 48 hours of when the symptoms appear,"" he said.","Virus kills teenager, three elderly people on hajj pilgrimage .

"(CNN) -- South African runner Caster Semenya will be allowed to keep the gold medal she won in the women's 800-meters at the World Athletics Championships in Berlin, Germany, in August, the country's sports ministry announced Thursday. In a statement on their official Web site the ministry added that Semenya had been found innocent of any wrongdoing but the widely anticipated results of gender tests conducted would not be made public. ""We have agreed with the IAAF that whatever scientific tests were conducted legally within the IAAF regulations will be treated as a confidential matter between patient and doctor,"" the statement read. ""As such there will be no public announcement of what the panel of scientists has found. We urge all South Africans and other people to respect this professional ethical and moral way of doing things."" The world governing body for athletics, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), have refused to comment on the announcement, only reiterating a statement published on their official Web site on Wednesday that the release of their gender-test findings would be delayed until ""further notice."" The IAAF had been expected to release its findings on February 20, but confirmed it had been in discussions with the South African Ministry of Sport and Recreation with a view to ""resolving the issues surrounding Caster Semenya's participation in athletics."" The IAAF went on to say that the medical tests on Semenya had still to be completed. ""There will be no discussion of Semenya's case at the forthcoming IAAF Council Meeting to be held in Monaco on 20-21 November 2009. No further comment will be made on this subject until further notice,"" their statement read. Reports in two newspapers in September said the results of the tests showed Semenya has both male and female characteristics. The IAAF has declined to confirm those reports. The South African ministry added they had been unhappy with way the testing had been handled: ""We have asked the IAAF to apologize at the way the whole Caster Semenya saga was dealt with. ""Their response is: 'It is deeply regrettable that information of a confidential nature entered the public domain.' The IAAF is adamant that the public discourse did not originate with them. ""We also cannot prove the contrary. It is our considered view that this chapter of blame apportioning must now be closed. The sport bodies must be allowed to deal with the rest of the investigations in terms of their own regulations,"" the statement added. The controversy over Semenya erupted after she crushed her rivals in the 800 meters and secured victory in one minute, 55.45 seconds -- the best women's time in the world this year. Semenya's masculine build and dominant performance fueled existing questions about her gender, and the IAAF -- which oversees the sport worldwide -- ordered tests to be carried out.","South African Olympic runner Caster Semenya will keep her gold medal, the country's sports ministry announced Thursday .

"O'Fallon, Missouri (CNN) -- Nathan Halbach is 22, with a diagnosis of terminal brain cancer. He knows that ""horrible stuff"" lies ahead. His mother, Pat Bond, has been taking care of him full time. But when she needed help, she reached out to the Roman Catholic Church. After all, his father is a priest. Nathan was born in 1986, during a five-year affair between his mother and Father Henry Willenborg, the Franciscan priest who celebrated Nathan's baptism. In a story first reported in the New York Times, it was revealed that The Franciscan Order drew up an agreement acknowledging the boy's paternity and agreeing to pay child support in exchange for a pledge of confidentiality. Now her son -- the youngest of four children -- may have just weeks to live. And when the Franciscans balked at paying for his care, she decided she was no longer bound by her pledge of confidentiality. ""I never asked for extraordinary amounts. I asked for the basic needs and care of my son,"" Bond told CNN's ""AC 360.""  But she said the church told her, ""No, we are not Nathan's biological father, we have no legal obligation to your son."" Willenborg, whose priestly vows require celibacy, has been suspended from his most recent assignment, in northern Wisconsin, as Catholic leaders investigate allegations that he was involved with another woman -- then in high school -- around the same time he was seeing Bond. Willenborg has acknowledged his relationship with Bond, but denies any inappropriate relationship with the other woman while she was a minor, according to his current bishop. And his order acknowledges its agreement to support his son, telling CNN they have paid about $233,000 to support Nathan over his lifetime. Since the affair has become public, the Franciscan Order has agreed to pick up Nathan's medical bills and the costs for the funeral that now appears likely. Willenborg refused to speak to CNN. But a statement to his parishioners in Ashland, Wisconsin, in September, said, ""My failure to be faithful to my vows has caused me and many others pain and disappointment. I have regretted this for a long time."" And in October, he told The New York Times, ""We've been very caring, very supportive, very generous over these 20-something years. It's very tragic what's going on with Nathan."" Bond, then Patricia Halbach, said she and Willenborg began their affair in 1983. At the time, Willenborg was a priest in her hometown of Quincy, Illinois, about 130 miles north of St. Louis, Missouri. Bond, then a 27-year-old, married mother of three, went to a retreat for women with troubled relationships. Willenborg was the retreat's spiritual director, and she said he was a ""terrific"" priest -- ""incredibly charismatic, very sought-after."" He began to counsel her on a regular basis. After about three months, at the end of one of their sessions, she said he kissed her. Bond said she went home and immediately asked her husband for a separation, and she said she began a romantic relationship with Willenborg. Bond said she knew he was forbidden to have sex with her. But she said when in love, ""You don't think clearly."" ""I make stupid decisions in my life,"" she said. ""I am not perfect, far from sainthood, and I loved him."" During their relationship, Bond was a lay leader in the church, and ""We were a very good team, a very dynamic team,"" she said. But in 1985, she learned she was pregnant. The pregnancy ended with a miscarriage that October. She said in its aftermath, she ended her sexual relationship with Willenborg, only to resume it the following spring. It was during that period that Nathan was conceived, she said. Nathan was born in December 1986. Willenborg had to disclose the affair and Bond's pregnancy to his superiors. A deal was negotiated by Father Robert Karris, who told CNN the Franciscans insisted on confidentiality ""to protect Nathan, his mother, and the priest."" But Karris, now on the research faculty of the Franciscan Institute at St. Bonaventure University in Olean, New York, also acknowledged the goal in part was to protect the church. The agreement was reached about a year after Nathan's birth. Afterward, Willenborg was removed from his job, and it was 17 years before he would lead a congregation again. He told his superiors that his relationship with Bond was over, but she said it continued. ""That was the statement, and they bought it,"" Bond said. ""But the truth of the matter is during those eight month of negotiations, we were living together physically, sexually and every form of relationship there was under their nose."" The relationship went on until Nathan was nearly 2 years old, Bond said. She and Willenborg went on family outings, including a trip to Florida, with Nathan and her children from her previous marriage. Back in Quincy, where she grew up, Bond said she had a simple answer to questions about Nathan's parentage: ""He's my baby."" But things ended in 1988, after Bond learned that Willenborg was seeing another woman. She eventually moved from Quincy to a St. Louis suburb. ""You had to go away, you had to take your story, you had to take your children, you had to get out of this town. We're a small community, everybody knew everybody,"" she said. Nathan grew up as a popular, athletic boy, a big fan of the St. Louis Cardinals baseball club and the Blues hockey team. He has autographs of the entire hockey team and a Cardinals uniform signed by All-Star first baseman Albert Pujols. For years, he said, he wanted a relationship with his father. ""He's popped in and out of my life, but I've never gotten the full respect and love out of him that I would always want,"" he said. But several years ago, after Willenborg took him out to dinner on their first night out in years, he said his father didn't seem to want to have anything to do with him. ""When it comes to this person who's my dad, who should be helping me out more than a person on the street, he hasn't done so throughout my 20-plus years of life,"" Nathan said. Nathan was diagnosed with cancer in 2006. Over the summer, he and his mother went to New York's Sloan-Kettering cancer center in a last-ditch effort to halt the disease. It was unsuccessful, and doctors give him a prognosis of weeks. ""If I just live my life as happy as I can, I can have a lot of fun until this horrible stuff happens,"" he said. The church had paid for some medical expenses and gave her $1,000 toward travel expenses for the trip, but not room and board or treatment costs, Bond said. And in the past week, she said, the church was questioning the cost of a looming funeral. ""They were concerned with getting us out of their lives, and I guarantee you, the day my son goes, the church will rejoice,"" she said. Since she went public, the Franciscans wrote a letter to Bond telling her they will cover 100 percent of her son's funeral costs -- and added, ""Please advise if there is any additional assistance that the Franciscans can provide to Nathan at this time in connection with his day-to-day expenses and comfort."" The order also has since said it will not take Bond to court for breaching the confidentiality of the agreement. For four years before September, Willenborg was a priest at Our Lady of the Lake church in Ashland, Wisconsin. Bishop Peter Christensen, whose diocese includes the church, said Willenborg was a good priest -- but added, ""Because of his behavior 23 years ago, the community is now suffering."" Nathan will not be going back to the hospital and will die at home, Bond said. She can't afford a part-time nurse to help take care of him in his last days, but said she hopes the church lives up to its word.","Nathan Halbach's father is the priest who baptized him, Henry Willenborg .

"(CNN) -- Torrential rains and flooding since June have affected 600,000 people in 16 West African nations, the United Nations reported Tuesday. People walk in the flooded streets of Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, last week. The worst hit have been Burkina Faso, Senegal, Ghana and Niger, said Yvon Edoumou, a spokesman for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, in the Senegalese capital, Dakar. So far, 159 people have died, he said. Sierra Leone has also been hard hit, according to the U.N. Edoumou said removing water from flooded areas is a top priority, but powerful pumps are in short supply. ""Some people refused to leave their homes so they are living in floodwaters,"" he said. The United Nations has not yet received reports of waterborne diseases, but Edoumou said a real threat exists of diarrhea or, worse, cholera. The U.N. World Food Programme said Tuesday it has begun distributing food to tens of thousands of homeless flood victims. WFP has set a goal of feeding 177,500 people, mainly in Ouagadougou, the capital of Burkina Faso, where 150,000 people have been affected and key infrastructure -- including a central hospital, schools, bridges and roads -- has been damaged. The flooding in Burkina Faso is the worst in 90 years, WFP said. Many of those in Ouagadougou most needing help were already receiving aid from WFP, but those rations were lost in the floodwaters, the U.N. reported. ""It is always the poor and vulnerable who suffer the most from floods like these as their few remaining assets are swept away, leaving them hungry and destitute,"" WFP Executive Director Josette Sheeran said. Roads and buildings have been ruined from Mauritania to Niger, the U.N. reported. In Agadez, Niger, a town about 458 miles (738 km) north of the capital, Niamey, close to 988 acres (400 hectares) of vegetable crops and hundreds of livestock were washed away. Herve Ludovic de Lys, head of OCHA in West Africa, said natural disasters have a lasting effect that unravels years of progress against poverty. ""The situation is very worrying,"" he said in an OCHA statement issued Tuesday. The rainy season in West Africa begins in June and continues through late September. In 2007, 300 people died and 800,000 were affected by the storms. This year, fears abound that more heavy rain will fall in already waterlogged areas. Despite the misery, Edoumou said the rains are a mixed blessing for countries dependent on agriculture. The harvest this year will be more bountiful, he said.","U.N. begins distributing food to tens of thousands of homeless flood victims .

"(CNN) -- Jennifer Valdivia scooped up the baseball after it sailed into the right-field stands. The 12-year-old smiled and giggled over the keepsake from her first Major League ballgame. Jennifer Valdivia, 12, holds the record-setting baseball after it was returned this week to her. She'd have to sue to get the ball back. This is the story of a baseball and the big leagues, of a young girl, a slugger and a lawsuit. It's about another stain on America's pastime -- commercialism colliding with a kid's innocent joy. Jennifer's big catch was the 200th home run for Ryan Howard, an All-Star for the Philadelphia Phillies. The 29-year-old first baseman achieved the milestone faster than any player in Major League history, in his 658th career game, 48 fewer games than the previous record. The ballclub wanted to give the ball to its star player. And that's where things got complicated.  Watch Jennifer smile as ball is returned » . It was mid-July. The Phillies squared off against the Florida Marlins at Land Shark Stadium near Miami. Jennifer was in the stands with her 69-year-old grandfather, her 17-year-old brother and one of his friends. Howard launched his history-making homer in the sixth inning, a solo shot to right field. The sixth-grader beat her older brother to the ball. Nearby, fans said they couldn't believe a girl came away with the prize. ""I was rubbing it in my brother's face,"" Jennifer later recalled. He'd been to many games before, but had never caught a homer ball. ""I got a ball and you didn't,"" she teased. Switcheroo leaves mom steaming . Excitedly, Jennifer called her mom on the phone. ""Mom, I got the ball!"" Moments later, the Marlins sent a team representative to the stands. Jennifer and her brother, Gian Carlos, were escorted to the Phillies' clubhouse. Their grandfather, a Cuban immigrant who doesn't speak English, stayed in his seat. A Phillies employee, Jennifer says, told her if she handed over the ball, she could come back after the game, meet the slugger and get him to autograph it. She gave the ball up. In exchange, she got cotton candy and a soda. Jennifer went back to her seat but returned to the clubhouse after the game -- this time, with her grandfather and the rest of her party. They waited. The Phillies slugger never showed up. A security guard walked up and gave Jennifer a ball autographed by Howard. But it wasn't the one she caught. This ball was clean and polished. Jennifer calls it ""the fake one."" ""I was, like, really sad."" Howard told reporters after the game that he was proud of his feat. He eclipsed Hall of Famer Ralph Kiner, who played on three teams from 1946 to 1955. Kiner's record had stood for more than a half-century. ""It's a nice record to have,"" Howard said. ""I'll take it and run with it."" When Jennifer's mother, Delfa Vanegas, got wind of what happened, she wasn't happy. She grilled her daughter about giving up the prized possession. ""What do you want me to do, Mom?"" Jennifer said. ""They were asking for the ball."" Vanegas' motherly instinct kicked in. She felt her daughter had been duped, robbed of something potentially worth thousands of dollars. ""It's my daughter,"" the steamed mom says. ""It's my blood."" She contacted the Phillies and asked for the ball. In baseball parlance, the Phillies balked. But the team did offer to give the family VIP tickets the next time they played in Florida. ""I don't want tickets,"" Vanegas replied. ""I want the ball back."" Entering the batter's box: attorney Norm Kent. He first approached the Phillies in July with his simple demand: Give the girl her ball. True value, and memories . Letting fans keep the home-run balls they catch is a time-honored tradition. It's a way for ordinary fans to connect with the superstars -- and to cash in on the catch if history has been made. When Salvatore Durante snagged Roger Maris' 61st home-run ball -- the one that broke Babe Ruth's single season home-run record in 1961 -- his life changed forever. Durante offered to give it to Maris, but the Yankees slugger declined. ""He said: 'Keep the baseball and try to make some money with it,'"" Durante once told the Baltimore Sun. He sold it for $5,000 -- what amounted to a year-and-a-half's salary for Durante. See where historic baseballs are now . Howard's ball is small potatoes in the world of sports memorabilia, maybe worth a couple thousand bucks on the open market. But it's hugely sentimental to the player -- and to the girl who caught it at her first ballgame. So, Kent's efforts to get the ball back for his young client met with resistance. There was no way of knowing ""with any degree of certainty whether the ball delivered was in fact the home-run ball,"" Phillies attorney William Webb wrote in a brush-back letter dated August 6. If the girl wants the baseball, Webb continued, contact Howard's agent, ""since the player now has the ball."" By Monday of this week, with the regular season over and no ball in hand, Kent took the extraordinary measure of suing on behalf of Jennifer. He sought the ball and a judgment ""in excess of $15,000."" The ball was promptly returned. ""Ryan Howard 200th career home run,"" it says in capital letters across the ball, now encased. ""My ball,"" Jennifer says with a smile. The Phillies, in the middle of a pitched playoff battle, have declined comment on the ball brouhaha. Howard's agent, Terry Prince, told CNN affiliate WSVN: ""He's willing to give the ball back to her without any strings attached. Free of charge."" As part of the settlement, Kent said Howard and the Phillies agreed to pay his attorney fee, about $1,000. Jennifer has no plans to sell. She keeps the ball in her room, hidden near her bunk so friends can't take it. ""When I grow up and everything, I'm going to show it to my kids,"" said Jennifer, who wants to be a pediatrician. ""Then, they're going to tell their kids, and their kids are going to tell their other kids."" Her message to ballclubs and millionaire players? The next time a child catches a home-run ball, let the kid keep it. Or, if you're going to take it away, at least ask a parent first.","Girl gets historic baseball back after suing Phillies and Ryan Howard .

"(CNN) -- Sen. John Ensign of Nevada admitted Tuesday to an extramarital affair with a woman who had worked for him. Sen. John Ensign of Nevada is considered a rising star in the Republican Party. Ensign, 51, would not identify the woman but said she and her husband had been ""close friends."" Her husband, he said, also worked for him. ""Last year, I had an affair,"" the Republican senator said outside his office in Las Vegas. ""I violated the vows of marriage. It's absolutely the worst thing I've done in my life. ""I take full responsibility for my actions. I know I have deeply hurt and disappointed my wife, Darlene, my children, my family, friends, my staff and those who believed in me. And to all of them, especially my wife, I'm truly sorry,"" he said. The senator's office also released a statement from Ensign's wife, saying, ""Since we found out last year, we have worked through the situation and we have come to a reconciliation. This has been difficult on both families. With the help of our family and close friends, our marriage has become stronger. I love my husband."" Ensign's spokesman, Tory Mazzola, said Ensign and a campaign staff member carried on the affair from December 2007 through August 2008. Her husband was an official Senate staff member for the senator. Neither remained in Ensign's employ as of May 2008. Ensign, a veterinarian, is considered a rising star within the Republican Party. A member of the party's Senate leadership, Ensign last year took over as chairman of the Republican Policy Committee. He was elected to the Senate in 2000 and comfortably won re-election in the midterm elections of 2006, when Democrats won back Congress. He is up for re-election in 2012. This month, Ensign spoke to a conservative group in Iowa, stoking speculation that he might have interest in running for the GOP presidential nomination in 2012.

"Hong Kong, China (CNN) -- The most coveted property on Hong Kong island is called ""The Peak,"" overlooking the city's stunning Victoria Harbor. But these days, the prices are what is taking people's breath away -- a modest apartment here now can go for $30 million. Recently what is claimed to be the world's most expensive apartment -- a 6,200-square-foot duplex -- sold for a record $57 million. While an implosion of property prices sparked the financial crisis in the United States, property prices in Hong Kong are booming in part because of mainland cash pouring into the city. China's superrich are purchasing homes and sweeping luxury brand items off the shelf here. ""There would be no good turnover of luxury brands in Hong Kong if it wasn't for the Chinese shopper,"" said Francis Guten, a luxury brand consultant in Hong Kong. Although total retail sales have dropped 4 percent this year, luxury brands are doing brisk business thanks to mainland shoppers. ""They come to Hong Kong because Hong Kong was always the first window on the world for luxury goods for the Chinese,"" Guten said, adding that the purchase of ""genuine"" luxury goods -- rather than the fakes that proliferate the mainland -- is actually cheaper in Hong Kong because of lack of sales taxes or tariffs. And how are they purchasing these goods? ""With cash,"" Guten said. ""Because they have the cash."" The real estate boom by mainlanders is a way for China's rich to diversify their investments close to home. ""If you look at the history of China, despite the fact that the economy is very strong on a global basis right now, there's been a very volatile period,"" said Francis Cheung of CLSA.

"(CNN) -- Soccer mom Meleanie Hain, who made national headlines last year by having a loaded, holstered handgun at her 5-year-old daughter's soccer game, has been found shot dead in her home along with her husband, police said Thursday. Meleanie Hain was found shot dead in her home along with her husband Thursday. Information from 911 calls shows that it took a SWAT team nearly an hour and a half to gain entry to the Lebanon, Pennsylvania, home Wednesday evening. Inside, they found the bodies of Hain, 31, and her husband, Scott, 33, police Capt. Daniel Wright said. Police have avoided labeling the incident a murder-suicide. However, they do not believe that another person was involved, Wright said. A full investigation is under way, he added. ""Who [Meleanie Hain] is does not change the course of this investigation,"" he said. The autopsies are scheduled for Friday.  Watch why Hain caused controversy » . Meleanie Hain's attorney, Matthew B. Weisberg, said she told him a few months ago that she and her husband were separating. It was not immediately clear whether they were still living together. The couple's three children were unharmed and took refuge at a neighbor's house before police arrived, Wright said, and the children remain in a neighbor's care. During the incident, police told neighbor Ann DiJohnson to avoid rooms with windows in fear of a possible shootout. ""It was frightening,"" DiJohnson said. ""I'm still shaking."" Thomas Shaak, who lives a block from the Hains, said the couple hardly socialized with neighbors. The avid gardener said he occasionally saw Scott Hain working on his yard, but the two did not greet each other. He said Hain worked as a security officer and often kept odd hours. Meleanie Hain became an overnight celebrity and, to some, a steward of Second Amendment rights when she carried a Glock strapped to her belt to her daughter's soccer game September 11, 2008. Days later, on September 20, her permit to carry a gun was revoked by Lebanon County Sheriff Michael DeLeo, who claimed that she showed poor judgment at the child's game. County Judge Robert Eby later reinstated the permit. Weisberg, Hain's attorney, said the sheriff's action violated Hain's First, Second, Fourth and 14th Amendment rights. A lawsuit was filed against DeLeo on Hain's behalf for compensatory damages. She sought punitive and statutory damages, Weisberg said, along with reimbursement of attorneys' fees and lost wages. Although Weisberg called the Hains a ""loving"" and ""unified"" couple, he said that about four months ago, Meleanie Hain told him that they were separating and that she wanted to remove his name from the $1 million lawsuit. Although there was no indication of abuse, Weisberg said, Meleanie Hain was contemplating getting a ""stay-away order."" ""It's shocking,"" Weisberg said of the shooting. ""And sadly ironic.""","Meleanie and Scott Hain shot to death in Lebanon, Pennsylvania, home .

"(CNN) -- A former Alabama judge is standing trial on charges he checked male inmates out of jail and forced them to engage in sexual activity such as paddling in exchange for leniency. Former Mobile County Circuit Judge Herman Thomas denies all the charges, his attorney says. Former Mobile County Circuit Judge Herman Thomas at one point faced more than 100 criminal counts in the case, including kidnapping, sexual abuse, extortion and sodomy. Prosecutors filed cases relating to 15 alleged victims, with multiple counts in each case. But four of those cases have been dismissed -- some thrown out by a judge because the statute of limitations expired and others because prosecutors decided not to present evidence relating to them -- leaving 11 alleged victims and 51 counts, according to defense attorney Robert Clark and CNN affiliate WKRG-TV. Retired Marengo County Judge Claud Neilson dismissed jurors Tuesday while attorneys argued whether the jury should be allowed to consider kidnapping, extortion or assault charges, WKRG reported. Neilson already has ruled there is enough evidence for jurors to consider the sex abuse charges. Thomas, 48, has pleaded not guilty and has denied any wrongdoing. Clark told CNN on Tuesday that Thomas was trying to mentor the inmates and did not assault them. ""The whole thing is, he tried to help people in this community,"" Clark said. ""He helped thousands to grow up and be productive citizens."" The judge does not deny bringing the inmates into his office, Clark said. ""He was mentoring them. He was trying to get them to do right, to be productive citizens."" One of the alleged victims testified Monday that he doesn't know why his semen was found on the carpet of a small room used as an office by Thomas, according to The Mobile Press-Register newspaper. But he did say Thomas spanked him with a belt on several occasions, the newspaper reported, and that the paddlings took place inside a jury room, in the small office and at a Mobile fraternity house. Another man testified that after he was charged with kidnapping and robbery in 2002, Thomas visited him in jail and urged the man to let Thomas decide the case instead of a jury, according to the Press-Register. Thomas convicted him of lesser charges, he testified, and sentenced him to a 90-day boot camp. He said Thomas also beat him with a belt on his bare buttocks about a dozen times at the courthouse, the newspaper reported. Neither man was identified. ""All of them [the alleged victims] were given preferential treatment at some point,"" Nicki Patterson, chief assistant district attorney for Mobile County, told CNN earlier this month. ""And ultimately, when some of them refused to continue participating [in the activities], they were given what I would view as excessive sentences. But certainly while the inmates were involved with the activities we allege, the state would say, it was extremely lenient sentences."" However, ""two of the individuals said he [Thomas] did nothing bad to them,"" Clark said Tuesday. ""That he didn't paddle them. That he only helped them. ... I mean, the last guy that testified was a murderer. And he's complaining he got assaulted. 'I got assaulted,' -- yeah, right."" Asked whether Thomas admits paddling the men, Clark said, ""I didn't say either way. ... I'm saying there ain't no sexual innuendoes."" Neilson has heard arguments on whether an expert should be allowed to testify about sexual fetishes for the prosecution. Clark said the expert has not interviewed any of the alleged victims and that he fails to see how the testimony fits into the case. Neilson was brought in to hear the case after all the Mobile County Circuit judges recused themselves -- standard procedure in a case involving another judge. Thomas resigned from the bench in October 2007 before he was scheduled to stand trial before the Alabama Court of the Judiciary on multiple ethics violations charges. The complaint, dismissed after the resignation, accused him of ""extrajudiciary personal contact"" with some defendants but does not refer to any sexual contact. In April, Thomas told WKRG the allegations against him are false, but the most important thing for him was making sure his wife and two daughters were taken care of. ""I'm not guilty, and I look forward to being a part of the community that's supported me and I've supported my entire life,"" he said. The Alabama State Bar suspended Thomas' law license in January after a grand jury handed up the first of two indictments against him. In April, the bar's disciplinary commission upheld the suspension, WKRG reported, despite the fact that Thomas under oath denied all the allegations in the first indictment. The second indictment was returned in August. CNN's Carolina Sanchez contributed to this report.","Defense lawyer: Ex-Alabama judge was mentoring inmates, not seeking sex .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- After four years of ""Jon & Kate Plus 8,"" Jon Gosselin said he's decided it's not healthy for his children to be on a reality show. Jon Gosselin appears on ""Larry King Live"" Thursday. He said he doesn't want his kids to continue with TV show. ""The reason I don't think it's healthy for them is that we're going through a divorce right now, and I don't think it should be televised and I think my kids should be taken off the show,"" Gosselin told CNN's Larry King on Thursday night. ""They're 5 and 8 now; let them experience a normal childhood,"" he said. His lawyer said the TLC reality series about the Gosselin family is dead because no judge would ever ""subject the children to the show if the father believes it's detrimental."" Jon and Kate Gosselin announced their separation and divorce filing -- after 10 years of marriage -- on a special one-hour episode in June. They agreed to share custody of their 5-year-old sextuplets and 8-year-old twins. ""I had an epiphany one day,"" Gosselin told King. ""I just looked in the mirror and I said, 'I don't want to be this person anymore.' I made mistakes. I know I messed up. I do regret a lot of things. But I have to learn from those mistakes and move forward.""  Watch Jon Gosselin talk with Larry King » . He blamed some of his mistakes on his not having a lawyer when he and his wife signed the show contract four years ago. ""He had no manager, he had no lawyer, he had no idea what he was signing,"" said Mark J. Heller, the lawyer recently hired by Jon Gosselin. ""Now I have a sense of empowerment,"" Gosselin said. ""Before, I didn't have any representation. I take blame for not being an initiator. I was an avoider. I was passive."" Kate Gosselin said she was ""saddened and confused by Jon's public media statements."" ""Jon has never expressed any concerns to me about our children being involved in the show and, in fact, is on the record as saying he believes the show benefits our children and was taping on Friday with the kids,"" she said. She said her estranged husband only changed his mind about their eight children's involvement after TLC ""announced the name change of the show and indicated that Jon would have a lesser role in the show."" ""It appears that Jon's priority is Jon and his interests,"" Kate Gosselin said. TLC announced Tuesday that it was retitling the show ""Kate Plus 8"" because of ""recent changes in the family dynamics."" Jon Gosselin's lawyer said the network only fired him ""before he fired the show."" The state labor department is investigating whether TLC violated child labor laws by not properly paying the children or getting permits for the past four seasons, Heller said. ""These kids have been working without compensation for four years,"" Heller said. Gosselin revealed to King that the family was paid $22,500 per episode, with none of the money specifically designated for the eight children. TLC, in a written statement Thursday, said it had halted ""direct filming of the children"" until Jon and Kate Gosselin have ""further conversations."" The network said Jon Gosselin's ""latest comments are grossly inaccurate, without merit and are clearly opportunistic,"" noting he and the family were taping as recently as last Friday. ""Despite Jon Gosselin's repeated self-destructive and unprofessional actions, he remains under an exclusive contract with TLC,"" the network said. Heller said, however, the contract the Gosselins signed four years ago with TLC was ""null and void"" because the network dropped Jon Gosselin. TLC gave King a written statement insisting the changes were allowed by the contract. The new show will take ""a deeper focus on Kate's role in the family and her journey as a single mother building the next chapter in her life,"" TLC said Tuesday. Jon Gosselin will still appear, ""but on a less regular basis,"" it said. Kate Gosselin's divorce lawyers told King that Jon Gosselin does not have the legal right to stop the children from appearing on the reality show because of the separation agreement the couple signed. ""He signed an agreement that party with physical custody will decide if they will be on taping,"" Mark Momjian said. ""He must go to court to change that."" Jon Gosselin said his relationship with TLC began to deteriorate at the beginning of the year when network executives began calling him, warning him that he was in breach of his contract. ""They put me on house arrest"" with bodyguards watching him around the clock, he said. As for his relationship with Kate, he said she told him a year ago she wanted to lead a life separate from him. He said he has not talked to Kate in almost a month, although he has tried calling and sending text messages. ""I want to work things out,"" he said. ""We know we're not going to be husband and wife, but we will always be mom and dad. We have to get our kids off television."" The eight children have continued living in their Wernersville, Pennsylvania, home. Their parents have rotated in and out of the home during their time with them.","Because of his divorce with Kate, Jon says children should no longer film show .

"(CNN)  -- When Charles Wolf watched President Obama's speech on Afghanistan, he nearly broke down in tears. He doesn't have a son or daughter headed off to war. But to him, his wife of 12 years was a war casualty: She was killed on September 11. When Obama described the attacks ""and he described how the whole world was with us, it emotionally took me right back to that moment,"" Wolf said. ""It was all I could do to keep from totally losing it."" Wolf's wife, Katherine, worked as an executive assistant for Marsh & McLennan on the 97th floor of the North Tower of the World Trade Center's Twin Towers. She sent an e-mail just two minutes before the first plane hit. ""Her office took a direct hit by the plane, and she was vaporized. There was nothing ever found of her,"" Wolf said. It's been eight years since the attacks of September 11 killed 2,976 people. A lot of memories have faded, Wolf said, but he still thinks of the little things: ""holding her hand, falling asleep next to her, waking up next to her, the companionship, the partnership."" ""She was great."" And so Wolf was glued to his television Tuesday for Obama's speech. He wanted to hear from the president how the nation is going to finish the job in what Wolf calls ""the womb of 9/11."" ""To address these issues,"" Obama said, ""it is important to recall why America and our allies were compelled to fight a war in Afghanistan in the first place. We did not ask for this fight. On September 11, 2001, 19 men hijacked four airplanes and used them to murder nearly 3,000 people. ""They struck at our military and economic nerve centers. They took the lives of innocent men, women and children without regard to their faith or race or station. Were it not for the heroic actions of the passengers on board one of those flights, they could have also struck at one of the great symbols of our democracy in Washington and killed many more."" Those words brought it all home: the memories of his wife with the beautiful smile and short-cropped red hair. ""I was biting my lip,"" he said. That said, Wolf is critical of the president's strategy, mostly his announcement to begin withdrawing the American contingent in July 2011. ""That is a tactical and strategic mistake,"" he said. ""If you're playing chess, do you tell your opponent your next move? ""To broadcast that for the sake of politics, to me, that is very wrong."" And so he was divided: pleased about the renewed commitment to the Afghanistan war but upset by the planned pullout date. iReport: Share your views on Afghanistan . Veteran New York firefighter Lee Ielpi lost his son, Jonathan, a fellow firefighter, on September 11. ""I support President Obama's decision to send more troops to Afghanistan and the war against al Qaeda and the Taliban,"" he said. A combat veteran of Vietnam, Ielpi added, ""The president and Congress need to ensure America has a clear strategy for our military in order to not repeat the strategic mistakes of Vietnam. I also strongly believe our country needs to do more to support returning veterans."" The office of Joe Daniels overlooks ground zero, an every-day reminder of what happened on September 11, 2001. He was standing outside the Twin Towers when they were hit. Daniels is now the president of the National September 11 Memorial & Museum, charged with the monumental task of building a living tribute to those who perished that day. ""In the aftermath of 9/11, there were a lot of citizens who signed up to do what they felt was a patriotic duty to respond to what happened, and many of them went to Afghanistan,"" Daniels said. ""So I think it's important that we don't forget that the history of 9/11 is still being written. There are still a lot of important things that have to be done in Afghanistan."" He added, ""After the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, we lapsed into complacency. And to have a focus on finishing what needs to be done, I think, is important. We can't fall back into that sense of isolation and complacency."" Wolf agreed. By returning in force to Afghanistan, he said, ""We are going in now to keep ourselves from being attacked again. ""This is not a war of choice,"" Wolf said. ""This is a war of necessity."" He hopes the American people understand that. It's why he can hardly speak when he sees U.S. soldiers in uniform. ""I am so grateful of the fact that they will lay their lives on the line for us,"" he said. For military families who will soon send their loved ones off to Afghanistan, Wolf said, ""Thank you. It's all you can say. Thank you for making the decision to do it. Thank you for loving your country."" ""I just ask every person out there if it was your wife who went to work one day and never came home,"" he said, ""would you do anything to make sure it doesn't happen again?"" Wolf paused at the end of the conversation and said simply: ""We have to remember 9/11.""","Time to go after ""womb of 9/11,"" says man who lost his wife .

"ROME, Italy (CNN)  -- The murder trial of American student Amanda Knox in the death of her housemate two years ago resumed Monday in Italy after a summer break. The trial of American college student Amanda Knox, 22, resumes Monday, September 14. Knox, 22, and her Italian ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito also face charges of sexual assault. They are accused of killing British student Meredith Kercher, Knox's housemate in Perugia, a scenic university town north of Rome. Kercher, 20, died in what prosecutors called a ""drug-fueled sex game."" She was found half-undressed in bed, with a stab wound to her neck on November 2, 2007. Knox and Sollecito were both present at Monday's court session, Kercher's attorney Francesco Maresca said. Sollecito's defense attorneys requested the annulment of DNA analysis, which investigators say shows Sollecito's genetic material on the clasp of the victim's bra. The judge rejected the request. The next hearing is scheduled on Friday, Maresca said. Knox, from Seattle, Washington, took the stand in June and testified that she was not at the girls' villa the night her roommate died, which authorities think was the evening of November 1. She said she was visiting her then-boyfriend, Sollecito, at his home, where the two watched a movie, smoked marijuana, had sex and went to bed. On her return to their villa the next morning, Knox said, she noticed ""strange things,"" such as the front door left open, dried blood in the bathroom sink and a locked door to Kercher's room. When Knox returned to Sollecito's house, he suggested they call police in case the house had been burgled, she said. Police found Kercher's body in the house. Prosecutors say evidence places the defendants at the scene. They also said the suspects gave investigators confusing and contradictory statements about their whereabouts the night Kercher died. Knox said she gave conflicting answers at the interrogation on November 6 because of police pressure and her confused state. ""When I would say that I was with Raffaele, they would say, 'You are a liar,' and they repeated this,"" she said in June, speaking about the police. ""'You will go to prison for 30 years. ... You must remember.'"" During the trial, she said police had slapped her on the head during questioning, a charge she had made before. The case has attracted worldwide media attention. During her testimony in June, cameras were barred from the courtroom because the prosecutor said he wanted to avoid sensationalism. A third person, Ivory Coast native Rudy Hermann Guede, was convicted of murder in the case in October and was sentenced to 30 years in prison. He is appealing his conviction.","Knox accused of killing her flatmate, British student Meredith Kercher .

"(CNN)  -- Responding to President Obama's State of the Union comments about the ""deep and corrosive doubts about how Washington works,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that ""the American people don't care about process."" Yet Americans have indicated that they are quite unhappy with how their government is working. According to a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, only 28 percent of those polled believe that the federal government is ""working well,"" while seven out of 10 believe that the ""unhealthy"" government is in need of reform. Almost 93 percent said there was too much partisanship; 84 percent said special interests had excessive power. We must always take these kinds of poll numbers with a grain of salt. Polls frequently show that Americans do not like how their government works, especially Congress. The U.S. is a country that has always expressed strong distrust of government. There have been a few exceptional periods, like the progressive era or the 1960s and 1970s, when this frustration turns into a concerted movement for government reform. During the 1960s and 1970s, liberal Democrats and Republicans concluded that much of their policy agenda would be impossible to achieve if the political process did not change. They perceived Vietnam and then Watergate as the outgrowth of deep flaws in how our government worked. During the 1970s, they were able to pass a series of significant reforms, such as a campaign finance system that included public funds for presidential campaigns and contribution limits. Reforms opened up more of the political process through sunshine laws and retrenched the power of the senior committee chairmen in Congress who had usually done as they pleased, ignoring the will of the majority. Ethics laws regulated the behavior of executive and legislative branch. Even the sacrosanct filibuster underwent an overhaul in 1975: The Senate lowered the number of required to end a filibuster from two-thirds of the Senate, 67; to three-fifths, 60. Many of the reforms did not work, some had unintended consequences, and others were gradually unraveled. But substantive reform was possible and, for a moment, changed the way that politics as usual worked. In addition to diminishing citizens' trust in government, the flaws of the political process constrain and limit what kinds of policies are even possible. If President Obama, Democrats and Republicans are serious about building trust among citizens and creating a more productive political process, they should work together to do something about it. If Washington is serious about reforming the political process, three specific areas deserve immediate attention. Filibuster reform: The 60-vote supermajority Senate has become dysfunctional. Both parties have expressed frustration with their inability to move legislation through the process. Both parties have used the filibuster as a normal tool of procedural warfare. Because of the rampant use of the filibuster since the 1960s, senators expect that 60 votes are now required on almost every piece of legislation. Reform can happen again. One option would be to switch to a majority-based system in which 51 votes can end debate. Another, more feasible, option would lower the number of senators required for cloture to 55. To improve the political prospects for any change, some observers have suggested that any reform would not take effect until after the 2012 election. Making it easier to end a filibuster is one of the most important concrete steps that Congress could take to actually diminish partisanship. The sources of partisanship are deep-rooted and hard to change. But filibuster reform would disarm both parties by weakening or removing one of their most powerful weapons. Campaign finance reform: A recent Supreme Court decision eliminated many of the barriers to corporate donations and third-party advertising. The power of private money in campaigns has been a huge political issue for over a century. Because politicians depend on interest group support to obtain funds for their campaigns, they constantly find themselves constrained when it comes to making policy. The influence of private money also diminishes public trust in government. Every story about another lobbyist like Jack Abramoff confirms their worst fears about corruption. It is not difficult to understand why Congress has crafted a health care bill that avoids making any huge changes to the basic infrastructure of the health care industry. According to The New York Times, citing the Center for Responsive Politics, the health care and insurance industry spent at least $648 million on lobbying in 2009 -- and 20 percent of the year-end reports were not in yet. Pharmaceutical companies spent about $245 million, which the Times said was more than any other single industry has ever spent lobbying on behalf of any issue. Several changes have been discussed in recent years. The administration has talked about placing certain kinds of fund-raising restrictions on companies that do business with the government. A second proposal is to build on local and state reforms by providing matching public funds to candidates who raise a certain minimum of private donations. In the end, offering an alternative source of funds to candidates and parties is the only way to change the system, or candidates will be forced to keep going back to the well of interest group money. Congressional earmarks and tax breaks: Pork-barrel politics is as American as apple pie. But in recent decades, the system by which legislators pass appropriations targeted to key interests has become pervasive. Legislators are comfortable putting provisions that are tailor-made for lobbyists or particular interests into bills. These earmarks are not subject to hearings or oversight. The use of earmarks by Senate Democrats to close the health care legislation that passed last month made the public uneasy. The other way in which Congress distributes hidden benefits is through tax breaks. During the 1960s, reformers named these ""tax expenditures"" to convey the point that the government essentially spends money by forgiving certain groups of their obligation. We have not had a major tax reform initiative since 1986. The time has come to clean out the tax code once again and reduce the number of provisions that are in the law. There is also bipartisan support for reforms that would limit the use of earmarks by legislators and make certain that they are fully disclosed upon being requested. Although voters tend to be more interested in bread-and-butter issues, as well as questions about war and peace, there are a few exceptional moments when public anger about the political system becomes so intense that we enter into a period of substantive reform. We might be reaching one of those points, but in the end it will require the initiative of the president and congressional leaders to make sure that calls for reform are not just empty rhetoric. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer: Public unhappy with government partisanship, ties to special interests .

"(CNN) -- Midway Atoll, a small stretch of sand and coral in the middle of the north Pacific, is home to one of the world's largest populations of Laysan albatrosses. Until 1993, U.S. Navy aircraft thundered down the runway of the military base on the island, but now ocean going birds nest and embark on their own epic cross-ocean journeys from the overgrown landing strip. Yet the impact of humans and increasing consumer waste from thousands of miles away continues to have a direct effect on the island's wildlife, as photographic artist Chris Jordan discovered when he traveled there in September. The American photographed the remains of albatross chicks that had died from consuming plastic waste found in the surrounding oceans. According to the artist, not a single piece of plastic in any of the photographs was moved, placed or altered in any way. The nesting babies had been fed the plastic by their parents, who collected what looked to them like food to bring back to their young. From cigarette lighters to bottle caps, the plastic is found in what is now known as the great Pacific garbage patch that stretches across thousands of miles of the Pacific Ocean. Fed a diet of human trash, it is thought that every year tens of thousands of albatross chicks die on Midway from starvation, toxicity and choking. Jordan has examined the environmental effects of consumer society in his previous work. Pieces in his ""Running the Numbers"" exhibition, use digitally manipulated drinks cans and plastic waste from the Pacific gyre, respectively, to create copies of Hokusai's ""Behind the Great Wave off Kanagawa"" and Seurat's ""Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte"".","Artist Chris Jordan photographed albatross remains on Midway Atoll in Pacific .

"PERUGIA, Italy (CNN)  -- American student Amanda Knox, accused of killing her housemate two years ago, testified in her murder trial Saturday that she was intimidated by Italian police during questioning. American college student Amanda Knox, 21,  testifies Friday at her murder trial in Perugia, Italy. Knox, 21, is charged in the death of British student Meredith Kercher, who was her housemate in Perugia, a university town north of Rome. Kercher, 20, died in what prosecutors say was a ""drug-fueled sex game"" after suffering a sexual assault. She was found half-naked, with a stab wound to her neck, in her bed November 2, 2007. Saturday was the second day of testimony for Knox, who is from Seattle, Washington. The public prosecutor, her defense lawyer, the attorney for her then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, and the judge asked her about what happened the night of Kercher's death and the following day. Both Knox and Sollecito, 25, are charged with murder and sexual assault. Knox tried to explain Saturday why she gave conflicting answers to police when they interrogated her on November 6. She said it was a combination of police pressure, their suggestions, and her confused and frightened state of mind. ""When I would say that I was with Raffaele, they would say, 'You are a liar,' and they repeated this,"" she said, testifying in fluent Italian. ""You will go to prison for 30 years. ... You must remember,"" Knox recalled the police as saying. Knox said the police were standing behind her and officers were going in and out of the interrogation room. A policewoman next to her was constantly pressing her to give them a name, and an interpreter on her right said people under trauma tend to forget things, she said. ""I was confused. ... I had so much fear,"" Knox said. She testified that she thought, ""Hell, perhaps they're right and I have forgotten."" Knox repeated Saturday that police slapped her on the back of her head while questioning her. As she spoke, she hit her head a few times with her right hand and gestured broadly. Knox testified Friday that she was not at the women's villa the night Kercher died, which authorities believe was the evening of November 1. She said she was at Sollecito's house.  Watch Knox take the stand » . Knox testified Friday that the couple had dinner, watched a movie, smoked marijuana, had sex and went to bed on the night of November 1. She said she returned to her and Kercher's villa the next morning to take a shower. That's when she said she noticed ""strange things"" such as the front door being left open, dried blood in the bathroom sink and on a bath mat, feces in the toilet, and the door to Kercher's room locked.  Watch Knox in court » . When Knox returned to Sollecito's house, she said, he suggested they call police in case the house had been burglarized. Police then found Kercher's body. All cameras were barred from the courtroom Saturday because the public prosecutor said he wanted to avoid ""sensationalism."" Cameras were allowed at the beginning of the session Friday but then ordered out. Knox's father, Curt, defended his daughter Saturday. ""What we've seen over the past five months is a character assassination, and now, hopefully .... a different point of view of who she is is coming out,"" he told reporters. People are beginning to see that ""she is not this dark angel she's been portrayed as,"" he added. ""Amanda did a great job"" on the stand, Curt Knox said. ""She was very articulate in her answers. She answered all of the questions truthfully. She was not quivering in her voice. She was looking the judge in the eyes."" Her attorney, Carlo della Vedova, described his client as ""very confident."" ""She has repeated exactly what happened that night, on the fifth and sixth, when she was arrested. She gave all the information that was requested"" during her testimony, he said. The trial is to resume next Friday, but Knox isn't expected to testify again. A third person, Ivory Coast native Rudy Hermann Guede, was convicted of murder in a fast-track trial in October and sentenced to 30 years in prison. He is appealing the verdict.","NEW: U.S. student Amanda Knox says questioners badgered, slapped, confused her .

"(CNN) -- Police have identified the man whose shooting of another man outside a store in Naples, Italy, was captured by a surveillance camera, the Italian news agency ANSA reported Saturday. The announcement came two days after police released the video of the brazen daylight shooting in hopes it would lead someone to come forward. Police did not release the man's name. The video, shot May 11, shows a man wearing jeans, a dark jersey and a baseball cap, walking into the store and looking around, turning and walking back out. Passersby appear unfazed. One woman tries to lift up the victim's head in an apparent attempt to see if she knew him; a man steps over the body. Police said they had been without any clues before the release of the video. A source who was not identified publicly said the killer was a man in his 30s from Naples' northern Sanita district who had recently left the city. A third man seen in the video was thought to have been an accomplice, but he told Il Mattino newspaper that he had nothing to do with the killing. ""I am the man of the film, but I have never been a lookout, and now I am afraid,"" the 39-year-old man said. ""I was taking a breath of air, waiting for my daughter to go shopping."" The man said he had been living ""in terror"" since acquaintances called him from Germany to tell him they had seen him on the video. Police said they knew of no motive for the killing, which took place in the poor neighborhood of Rione Sanita, where Camorra, the name for organized crime in Naples, is strong. The victim was a bank robber, the spokesman said. A police spokesman said Camorra has been blamed for about 60 killings this year in Naples and its surrounding county.","Surveillance video shows man shooting another man outside a store in Naples, Italy .

"(CNN)  -- The South Carolina Ethics Commission has charged Gov. Mark Sanford with 37 counts of violating state ethics laws, according to a complaint released by the commission on Monday. The complaint follows a three-month investigation into Sanford's use of taxpayer money. Sanford is accused of using tax money to buy business-class airfare on domestic and international flights, flying on a state-owned aircraft to political gatherings or events ""which involved no official business,"" and spending campaign funds for personal use such as buying a ticket to attend President Obama's inauguration in January. South Carolina law requires state officials to buy the lowest fares available for flights, and bars the use of state aircraft for personal use. Sanford's office did not respond to requests for comment about the charges. The governor, once a rising star in the Republican Party before he revealed an extramarital affair in June, faces a hearing along with his legal team before a three-member ethics panel. Cathy Hazelwood, general counsel to the state Ethics Commission, said no date has been set for the hearing. After arguments are presented, the panel will determine if Sanford broke any state laws. The ethics case involves civil charges that are punishable by fines, and Sanford can appeal decisions up to the state Supreme Court. Only the state attorney general, Henry McMaster, can decide to pursue criminal charges against the governor. McMaster is reviewing the allegations to determine if any laws were broken. The new charges compound Sanford's political problems, which have been simmering for months as investigators scrutinized his finances. State legislators already have filed an impeachment resolution against the governor for leaving the state this summer to visit his Argentine mistress without installing a proper chain of command or informing his staff. A special House subcommittee will meet in Columbia on Tuesday to formally consider the resolution for the first time. State Rep. Greg Delleney, a Republican and one of the sponsors of the impeachment resolution, said he expects the subcommittee to look over the ethics commission results during the Thanksgiving holiday and decide whether to adjust the measure to include material from the ethics complaint. Delleney said he thinks Monday's report will give new momentum to the impeachment push. ""The sheer volume of the violations might be useful in bringing some more representatives over to the side of impeachment,"" Delleney said. If the special subcommittee decides to move forward with impeachment, the resolution will be passed onto the Judiciary Committee, which will then vote on whether to bring it to the floor of the legislature when lawmakers return to the state capital of Columbia in January. For Sanford to be forcibly removed from office, two-thirds of the South Carolina House and and two-thirds of the state Senate must vote to impeach him.","Sanford is accused of using tax money for personal travel .

"(CNN) -- The FBI is investigating as a possible hate crime an incident in which a woman was beaten to the ground in front of her child at the entrance to a Cracker Barrel restaurant in Morrow, Georgia, south of Atlanta. Troy Dale West, of Poulan, Georgia, is facing battery and cruelty to children charges after the incident. Troy Dale West Jr., of Poulan, Georgia, is facing charges including misdemeanor battery and disorderly conduct after allegedly beating Army reservist Tashawnea Hill, 35, after the two had words at the entrance of the Morrow, Georgia, restaurant the evening of September 9. Hill, an African-American, told police that West, 47, yelled racial epithets at her as the attack took place. ""He did punch me with a closed fist repeated times. My head is still hurting today. I have knots on my head,"" Hill told CNN Wednesday night, adding she also was kicked. Police said witnesses confirmed her account. The FBI has ""initiated an investigation in the matter to determine if a civil rights violation occurred,"" the agency said in a statement. Because the alleged incident happened in full view of Hill's 7-year-old daughter, the Clayton County district attorney's office added a felony charge of cruelty to children. ""[The woman's daughter] was visibly upset the night of the attack,"" according to Capt. James Callaway of the Morrow Police Department, who said he was on the scene shortly after the alleged attack. A police report of the incident said Hill's daughter was ""crying uncontrollably and her body [was] shaking/trembling"" from witnessing the attack.  Watch Hill discuss ordeal with CNN's Rick Sanchez » . Hill told police the incident started when she and her daughter were entering the restaurant at the same time West and his wife were exiting. ""The man slung open the door pretty hard and fast and I had to push my daughter out of the way,"" Hill told CNN affiliate WSB-TV. ""I turned to the man and I just said, 'Excuse me sir, you need to watch yourself; you almost hit my daughter in the face.' And from there it just went downhill."" West, according to the police report, admitted striking Hill ""after she spit on me and accused me of trying to hit her daughter with a door."" Appearing on CNN Wednesday night, Hill and her attorney, Kip Jones, denied that she spat on West. Jones said he saw surveillance video of the incident. ""At no point did Ms. Hill do anything to provoke the attack. She did not spit on Mr. West. She spoke to him. He attacked her,"" Jones said. Police say Hill stated that ""West punched her in the left cheek, forehead, kicked her body in several places, and punched her head in many areas several times."" The Cracker Barrel's manager told police he stepped between West and Hill to stop the alleged assault. Cracker Barrel spokeswoman Julie Davis said Wednesday that the restaurant was cooperating fully in the police investigation. ""It's just terrible when something like this happens anywhere, let alone in one of our stores,"" Davis said. ""It's worth noting that Cracker Barrel employees did their best to assist Hill as soon as they became aware of the situation."" Jones said he was ""convinced this was a hateful, racist attack ... based on the N-word, the B-word, etc."" ""The language was vile. It was racist. It was sexist. It was completely offensive, completely unprovoked,"" Jones said. CNN's efforts to reach West at his home and business were unsuccessful. Police said they had no indication West had an attorney. He is free on bond awaiting a hearing in the incident, the Clayton County jail said. Hill was treated at a hospital after the attack and released. The Clayton County district attorney has forwarded surveillance video of the incident to the FBI.  Edward DuBose, president of the Georgia State Conference of the NAACP, said Wednesday his organization was concerned about the alleged assault. ""We do know that to see a young mother beat [and] grabbed the way this young lady was, raised concern to us in this community,"" DuBose said at a news conference in Morrow. ""Certainly it raised concern in this incident that some of the language ... was used toward this mother."" He said he hoped the FBI would ensure ""that justice is served."" He said his organization hadn't spoken to Hill, but that it planned to reach out to her.","Woman: I'm still in pain a week after attack .

"MAMONI VALLEY PRESERVE, Panama (CNN) -- A famed primatologist says the plight of chimpanzees helped inspire Michael Jackson to write the song ""Heal the World."" Michael Jackson loved chimpanzees, said Jane Goodall: ""They made him smile."" But the theme and the lyrics of the song turned out to be about a better world for humanity. ""He wrote what he told me he thought was his most powerful song ever, but it didn't end up for animals,"" Jane Goodall said in a CNN interview Thursday night. Goodall spoke exclusively to CNN in a Panamanian rain forest where she is exploring a partnership on behalf of Roots & Shoots, her global youth education program. The interview comes as a new version of the song, first released on Jackson's 1991 ""Dangerous"" album, is being recorded by a collection of artists for release in late October. Goodall became friends with Jackson about 20 years ago when he invited her to his Neverland Ranch, where ""he talked about his dreams for the place to have animals running, looking free like they would in the wild. ... It was just a very charming day, very low key, nobody else was there,"" she said. Goodall, famous for her 50 years of groundbreaking research on chimpanzees in Africa, said Jackson invited her because ""he loved what I did."" ""He loved chimpanzees,"" she said. ""He loved to watch them feeding. He liked their faces. They made him smile."" Years later, she met Jackson's chimp, Bubbles, and has visited him at his retirement refuge in Florida, she said. ""He's extremely handsome,"" she said. ""He's a beautiful, beautiful chimp. So, he was rescued in time from this life of being inappropriately dressed up and carted around like a little symbol."" Goodall, whose life has been spent understanding chimpanzees, said she found Jackson to be ""a sad person."" ""In some ways, he was like a child, and a very sweet and gentle child, and he wanted me to tell him many, many stories,"" she said. ""Stories about the chimpanzees, the forests, animals, anything. He told me he liked the way I told stories."" Goodall, who travels the world to promote protection of endangered chimps, said she had hoped Jackson would help get her message out. ""I said to him, 'You know, Michael, if you want to help, you could do a concert and give us a percentage. Or much better, write a song,' "" she said. Jackson asked her for tapes of animals in distress because ""he wanted to be angry and cry"" as he wrote the song, which became ""Heal the World,"" she said. The original CD cover notes credited Goodall for inspiring the song, she said. But, she added, the Jane Goodall Institute never saw any money from the song. Jackson later created the ""Heal the World Foundation,"" which he funded with a series of concerts. The group delivered millions of dollars of relief to children around the world.","Jane Goodall says Michael Jackson loved chimpanzees .

"(CNN) -- Iran on Sunday released on bail four journalists and a retired professor whom it had held for two months, the semiofficial Iran Labour News Agency reported. The five prisoners had been held since they were arrested during a December 27 protest, according to ILNA. The journalists are Abdolreza Tajik, Mashallah Shamsolvaezin, Behrang Tonkaboni and Mohammad Javad Mozafar, who is also a prisoners' rights activist, ILNA said. The news agency reported that the retired professor is Mohammad Sadeq Rabani. Separately, ILNA reported that Tehran prosecutor Abbas Jafari Doulatabadi said Sunday that ""detainees of recent unrest will be released due to the upcoming Iranian new year,"" which falls on March 21. At the same time, ILNA quoted Doulatabadi as saying that those arrested on the Muslim holy day of Ashura, when the five prisoners freed on bail Sunday were rounded up, could face stiff penalties later. ""The judiciary will imply more strict policies, and those who were arrested on Ashura Day will be confronted heavily by the judiciary,"" he said. Mozafar and Tajik were released on $100,000 bail, according to Parleman News, the Web site of the minority reformists of the parliament. It did not mention the bail amount for the other two journalists. CNN was not immediately able to independently verify the bail amount. The protests around Ashura were Iran's deadliest clashes since protests broke out last summer after incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad claimed more than 62 percent of the vote in national elections. At least seven people were killed and hundreds were arrested on Ashura, witnesses said. The Iranian government has denied that its security forces killed anyone, blaming reformists for the violence. Doulatabadi, the Tehran prosecutor, said Sunday that the judiciary and police forces will be on high alert near the Iranian new year. The judiciary and police will ""confront those who disturb the norms of society with high explosives,"" he said. The five prisoners were released Sunday from Tehran's Evin prison. ILNA did not release the professional affiliations of the journalists, but they were listed on opposition Web sites. According to some main opposition Web sites, Tajik is an editor for Farheekhtegan, a weekly magazine, and a freelance journalist. Shamsolvaezin has edited many of post-revolutionary Iran's first independent newspapers, including Kayhan, Jame'eh, Neshat and Asr-e Azadegan, according to opposition sites. Many of those have been closed down. Tonkaboni is the editor of the magazine Farhang va Ahang, or Culture and Music, according to opposition sites. Javad Mozafar is publishing director of Kavir, a publishing house, and vice president of the Committee for the Defense of Prisoners' Rights, according to opposition sites.

"RAJASTHAN, India (CNN) -- Some call him the River Maker, others the Rainman of Rajasthan. His real name is Rajendra Singh. His nicknames come from his self-imposed mission to solve his state's water problems, one raindrop at a time. Rajendra Singh is trying to solve water issues in Rajasthan -- one of India's driest states. ""Today with global warming and climate change so many things are going on. Yes, this is the global problem. This is the modern problem. The solution is indigenous water conservation,"" Singh says. Singh lives and works in Rajasthan, one of the driest states in India. It is the country's largest state in land mass but has only about one percent of the country's water resources. Singh has spent the last 25 years of his life practicing what he preaches there. His message is always the same. He says rainwater is a resource we cannot afford to waste, instead we should capture and utilize it. ""If the drops come from the cloud, we can catch it!"" He says with his hands stretched to the sky. ""And that drop go[es] into the under[ground] aquifer and fulfills the aquifer. If that drop comes back so [it will] make springs, make a river."" We caught up with him in Rajasthan's Alwar district. One of India's so-called ""princely states"" once ruled by Indian royalty. Back in the 1980s the government declared the area a dark zone: An area villagers could no longer pump up clean water because the water table had gotten so low. ""When there was a famine there was a drought I had to leave."" Farmer Narin Joshi told us who has lived in the area his whole life. ""I had to work as a laborer in Delhi to make ends meet. There was no way I could earn any money here. I had to go."" That meant leaving his wife behind to raise their children and try to keep them fed. ""If there is a harvest we benefit from the farm."" His wife Kalawati Devi his wife says. ""And if there is no harvest we get nothing."" For 10 years Joshi worked as a snack seller in Delhi sending back money to help his family survive. He says that all changed after Singh and his organization Tarun Bharat Sangh showed up. The group came to teach the villagers something their forefathers once practiced: The building of traditional dams called Johads. The dams are made of earth and rock. They are fashioned to capture the rain so the water will trickle down and replenish the aquifer eventually giving rise to water in the wells and bringing dead rivers back to life. But the work takes a community effort. One family is not enough to get it done. Singh says his role is to teach and motivate the community. ""There are more than 10-thousand water harvesting structures we [have] made in last 25 years. And all these structures came through the community effort. I just motivate and realize to the community and [the] community joined hands with us and they made it!"" It is easy to see the result when water becomes available again. Everything from water buffalo to majestic peacocks. Water snakes gather at the watering holes. Over the years Singh says his organization and the villagers of Rajasthan have revived seven rivers across the state helping more than a thousand villages. Now instead of traveling long distances carrying heavy vats of water, or migrating to the cities to make a living, the villagers can stay put and begin to enjoy their surroundings more. The availability of water brought the Joshi family back together again because the husband could finally make a living here. ""I have planted many kinds of trees. For my livelihood I do farming."" He says ""My family and I are leading very peaceful lives.""","Rajendra Singh has devoted his life to solving Rajasthan's water problems .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The Phenomenon is back. You may not have recognized him when he came on as a substitute for Corinthians in a Brazilian Cup match, though. After all, he's a few kilos heavier than the Ronaldo we grew to know and love in the last decade. Comeback Brazilian: Ronaldo is playing competitive football again -- but will he reach his former glory? However, at 32 years of age, Ronaldo Luis Nazario de Lima is attempting another comeback. Will it be a successful one? As far as I am concerned, it won't. Debate: Do you think Ronaldo can return to his former glory? Tell us in the Sound Off box below. I have had the privilege of interviewing Ronaldo various times, and spent some one-on-one time with him in Italy and France. He's a great guy, friendly, humble and fun-loving. However, that last personality trait has contributed to a turbulent career and lifestyle. Wherever he has gone, the striker has always made his mark, on and off the field. While he was helping Barcelona, Inter Milan, Real Madrid and Brazil win a multitude of titles, he also found himself in the headlines a multitude of times for all the wrong reasons. It's true that Ronaldo has always been unfortunate with injuries - he has undergone three major knee operations. However, his love for a night out and for a playboy lifestyle may have also contributed to the breakdown of his body. In my opinion, this is the reason he will struggle to stay fit and motivated for Corinthians this season. There are too many temptations for him in Brazil, and I don't see him being able to resist all of them. Furthermore, he has won practically everything there is to win in the world of football, with the exception of the Champions League. So it would be fair to say that he's not going to bend over backwards to make sure his new team wins some silverware this season. He will score the odd goal and make the odd highlight, but I don't expect his latest comeback to be a success.","Brazilian Ronaldo is back playing competitive football for Corinthians .

"BAUCHI, Nigeria (CNN) -- The truck driver kept his hand on the horn, but resorted to shifting into first gear and used the full weight of his container truck to force his way through the over-crowded and narrow market street. In Nigeria, men burn broken computer equipment to collect reusable metals like copper. But the truck's rattling bulk, over-charged exhaust, and zealous horn only added extra rhythm to the cacophony of hawkers, hagglers, trucks and generators. This was just one of the many deliveries this morning for the big importers of Lagos's second-hand electronics Alaba market. ""A lot of people are interested in buying computer -- just to know what is going on in the world,"" explained Gabriel Okonkwo, as he watched his latest shipment arrive. The doors of his container were thrown open to reveal an Aladdin's cave of second-hand treasures -- computers, stereos, printers and televisions. All were quickly passed down to a mob of eager hands, where they are quickly sold to the local electronic stores. Nigeria is desperate for cheap electronic goods to try and bridge the digital divide with the West.  Watch a report showing piles of e-waste in Nigeria » . It is estimated five hundred containers of second-hand electronics are imported to Nigeria every month. It is also estimated that three-quarters of these imported products are broken beyond repair. The figures come from a US-based Environmental group -- BASEL Action Network -- who warns that the broken electronics discarded at local dumpsites are a mounting environmental disaster. At one of the local dumpsites, young boys sift through the electronic waste looking for anything of worth. Cables and wires are burnt to get at re-usable metals like copper wire, a practice which releases toxic metals and chemicals harmful to the local population. ""If you don't control it, there will be serious contamination and exposure of large populations to heavy metals from e-waste. Because it's a huge volume of waste we're talking about. And it's spreading,"" explains Oladele Osibanjo, the director for BASEL Nigeria. The irony is that many of these electronics were discarded by their original owners in the West for recycling. But not all second-hand computers shipped to Nigeria end up on the dumpsites. Traveling to northern Nigeria, we visited the Iya Abubakar Resource Center's IT training course -- attended by students, businessmen, and women. The Centre imports computers, but from charities like Computer Aid in the UK, to ensure they are reliable. For Aisha Hussain, the Center's director, it would be a waste not to use the business and education opportunities provided by the second-hand computers. ""Once you empower someone you do not consider it as waste,"" she explained. ""You empower the person socially, financially -- that shouldn't be referred to as waste because you've given that person a life."" The Nigerian government has ordered a crackdown on the importation of harmful and waste electronics, and is supporting plans to build a recycling plant in the region. Over-seeing the re-sale of his small mountain of televisions and computers, Gabriel Okonkwo is aware of the environmental problems but insists business must be taken into account. ""Both of them have to come hand-in-hand so we can live. If I don't do business I will die, and if the environment is bad I can die,"" he explained. ""So I have to do business in a way that will not affect the environment.""

"London, England (CNN) -- Procter & Gamble is recalling Vicks Sinex nasal spray in the United States, Britain and Germany after finding it contained bacteria, the company said. Procter & Gamble said it announced the voluntary recall after finding the bacteria in a small amount of product made at a plant in Germany. There have been no reports of illness from the bacteria, but it could cause serious infections for people with weakened immune systems or those with chronic lung conditions such as cystic fibrosis, Procter & Gamble said late Thursday. The bacteria poses little risk to healthy people, the company said. Cincinnati, Ohio-based Procter & Gamble said it detected the problem during routine quality control at the plant. Analysis so far shows the problem is limited to a single batch of raw material mixture involving three lots of product, which were sold only in the three countries affected by the recall, the company said. In the United States, the recalled product is Vicks Sinex Vapospray 12-hour Decongestant Ultra Fine Mist with lot number 9239028831. In Britain, the company is recalling Vicks Sinex Micromist Aqueous Nasal Spray with lot number 9224028832.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Quentin Tarantino's new movie ""Inglourious Basterds"" comes with a film inside the film, a Nazi propaganda movie promoting the glory of Germany's Third Reich. Eli Roth and Brad Pitt star in ""Inglourious Basterds."" Roth also directed a short film within the film. Tarantino said he's not worried people might be offended by the short film, which is being promoted by a trailer that is now a viral video on the Internet. ""You would have to have absolutely, positively no sense of humor at all not to get it,"" Tarantino said. ""Stolz der Nation"" -- which translates into English as ""Nation's Pride"" -- was produced true to the style of Joseph Goebbels, Adolf Hitler's propaganda minister, but by Eli Roth, the director-actor who also plays one of Tarantino's ""Basterds"" known as the ""Bear Jew."" ""There was something that we enjoyed immensely about the idea of a Jew making a Nazi propaganda movie,"" Tarantino said.  Watch Tarantino talk about how ""Nation's Pride"" was made » . Roth, well known for his R-rated horror flicks such as ""Hostel,"" said while growing up as a Jewish boy in Boston, Massachusetts, he never dreamed he would make a Nazi propaganda film. ""After 'Hostel 2,' I thought 'God, what can I make that's more offensive and upsetting than this film,' but somehow I did it with 'Nation's Pride,'"" Roth said. Roth viewed the black-and-white film as a character in ""Inglourious Basterds,"" a World War II fairy tale about a squad of Jewish-American soldiers who infiltrate behind enemy lines to terrorize the German army. Their plot to assassinate Hitler focuses on a small Paris, France, theater where Germany's leadership is gathered for the premiere of Goebbels' movie. The black-and-white film glorifies a fictional war hero played by Daniel Bruhl ""and the glory of the swastika and the power of Germany,"" Roth said. ""His courage was bound by duty. His legend was baptized in blood. His name will be crowned in glory,"" the trailer's narrator says as Pvt. Fredrick Zoller picks off dozens of American soldiers from a sniper's nest. ""Being Jewish, I wanted to make it a real propaganda film,"" Roth said. ""I was, like, I want to show what these movies are like. I don't want to do a sanitized version."" Using just 20 extras and five stuntmen, Roth shot the five-and-a-half-minute film in three days in Gorlitz, Germany, the same town where ""The Reader"" was filmed a year earlier, he said. ""The whole time we were shooting, we were, like, not only does this have to impress Quentin, this has got to impress the Fuhrer,"" he said. ""Hitler has to see this and go 'This is your finest work.'"" ""The German crew were going 'God, normally, we can't do this. This is so illegal.' And I was, like, 'this is what they did,'"" he said. ""This is what Joseph Goebbels would have done, and this has got to be honest and accurate."" While only parts of ""Nation's Pride"" are seen in ""Inglourious Basterds,"" Roth said Tarantino will likely include the complete film as a bonus on the DVD.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- More than 3,000 U.S. troops scheduled to deploy to Iraq won't go after all, as the military tries to draw down troop levels in the war-torn country, a Pentagon spokesman said Saturday. U.S. troops speak to an Iraqi child in Baghdad on Monday. The 1st Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division will not replace a North Carolina National Guard unit already in Iraq, Lt. Col. Eric Butterbaugh told CNN. The 3,500-troop combat team, based in Fort Drum, New York, was to leave in January, he said. ""[The cancellation] reflects a thorough assessment of the security environment in Iraq and continued improvement in the ability of the Iraqi security forces to safeguard Iraqi citizens and institutions,"" Butterbaugh said. The National Guard unit is still on schedule to return home, which will speed up the drawdown of forces, he said. The troop withdrawal in Iraq coincides with a debate in the Obama administration on whether to send as many as 40,000 more U.S. troops to Afghanistan. As of Friday, 250 U.S. soldiers have been killed in Afghanistan since the start of the year, according to a CNN tally based on Pentagon numbers. The United States plans to withdraw all its combat troops from Iraq by August, leaving 50,000 in advisory roles. Those advisers are to leave by the end of 2011. Concerns that a delay in the upcoming Iraqi elections could put a dent in scheduled withdrawals was rejected Friday by U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Chris Hill. ""As for our schedule of troop withdrawal, we've been pretty clear about when the troops would be withdrawn,"" he told CNN. ""So our plan is to draw down the troops as we've said we're going [to] do."" The polls are scheduled to open January 16, but both the United States and the United Nations are worried because Iraq still has no election law. If a new law isn't adopted, the government may have to change the election date or rely on the law used in the 2005 elections, some officials say. A vote on the new law is expected Monday. Pentagon officials also must weigh the impact of continuing violence in the country. Hill said the violence is a concern, as are insurgent efforts to undermine attempts at reconciliation in the divided country. ""Reconciliation is a tough business. I mean I've been in some of these meetings with people, you know, they don't like each other, you have to get them to work together, get them to understand their futures are together, and then you get a bombing, which makes it even tougher,"" Hill said. ""Again, I think the Iraqi people have really signaled that they are really sick and tired of this stuff.""  Meanwhile, violence continued in Iraq on Saturday. Four soldiers were killed and 10 people, including civilians and security forces, were wounded when a bomb targeting an Iraqi army checkpoint exploded in Falluja, an Anbar province town, an Iraqi Interior Ministry official said. Elsewhere in Anbar, a suicide truck bomb hit a police checkpoint on a bridge west of Ramadi, wounding a police officer. The blast badly damaged the bridge, which carries a highway linking Iraq with Jordan and Syria, the official said. Traffic had to be rerouted to an another road. Anbar province, a massive region populated mostly by Sunni Arabs, had been a major front in the Iraqi war. The al Qaeda in Iraq militant group once held great sway in Anbar, but its influence lessened with the advent of U.S.-backed groups called Awakening Councils. CNN's Scott Spoerry and Mohammed Jamjoom contributed to this report.","Cancellation reflects improved conditions in Iraq, official said .

"GAALKACYO, Somalia (CNN)  -- The U.S. government is delaying ""tens of millions"" of dollars in crucial humanitarian aid over concerns that the money is being diverted to a notorious militant group, a senior U.N. official said. Al-Shabaab militants ride through Mogadishu, Somalia, after a religious gathering in September. The U.S. government, concerned about the challenges in delivering assistance in a country wracked by civil war, says allegations that Al-Shabaab is stopping aid from reaching the people are under review. Although one U.S. government source said aid continues to flow to Somalia and hasn't been suspended, another said aid might not reach ""some parts of the country"" because of Al-Shabaab, the al Qaeda-linked terror group that is trying to overthrow the government. Located in the Horn of Africa, Somalia has long been a lawless, war-ravaged nation. The United Nations says that nearly half the population is dependent on humanitarian assistance, and one in five children are acutely malnourished. Somalia has suffered through five consecutive seasons of drought, and the ongoing conflict has caused more than a million people to be displaced. Kiki Gbeho, head of office for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Somalia, said the United States is reviewing whether its aid helps fund Al-Shabaab. The U.N. office, in a report issued in September, said the U.S. delay in reaching a decision on humanitarian funding ""is already impacting on many agencies and their programmes."" The United Nations estimates that 60 percent of the people it needs to reach with emergency assistance live in areas controlled by Al-Shabaab. ""According to humanitarian principles, we have to serve people and need to deal with those in charge,"" Gbeho said. Peter Smerdon, chief spokesman for the World Food Program, the agency responsible for delivering aid to Somalia, would not comment on the U.S. funding controversy but said investigations into whether Al-Shabaab is assisted by U.N. aid assistance are ""ongoing."" Food supplies could run out for millions of Somalis in the next few weeks, according to the United Nations. The U.S. government is traditionally the biggest donor for food assistance. The issue of breakdowns in humanitarian aid in Somalia has long concerned the United States. A senior administration official and an administration official spoke about the issue on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. The senior U.S. administration official said that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Transitional Federal Government President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed discussed in August how the ""delivery of services"" to the Somali people be broadened. Clinton said publicly in Nairobi that the United States continues to provide ""humanitarian assistance to the Somali people where delivery is feasible and effective."" The administration official said that the aid has never stopped, adding that food bound for the World Food Program in Somalia is on a vessel and should arrive in a few weeks. The senior administration official said, ""We are working with groups there to ensure that we can deliver assistance without having to pay off Al-Shabaab in the process. It does mean that aid may get to certain parts of the country but not others.""","Washington reviewing claims that money is being diverted to militant group .

"PADANG, Indonesia (CNN) -- As many as 4,000 people could be buried under the rubble in the aftermath of the devastating earthquakes in Indonesia, United Nations officials said Saturday. Indonesian soldiers crawl under the rubble of a collapsed building to search for victims. Local disaster management officials put the death toll from the quakes at 540. Earlier U.N. figures that put the death toll at 1,100 were just estimates, said El-Mostafa Benlamlih, a U.N. humanitarian coordinator. A 7.6-magnitude quake struck Sumatra on Wednesday and a 6.6-magnitude earthquake hit Thursday morning in the same region. Wednesday's quake reduced buildings to rubble in the city. People used hammers, chisels and bare hands to dig through debris for survivors and belongings.  Watch CNN's Arwa Damon report on search-and-rescue efforts » . Staff at a local hospital treated the injured outside the semi-collapsed building as bodies of the dead lay in makeshift morgues. An area that now looks like a flattened mess of destruction was, just days ago, a group of three villages. Officials believe 90 percent of the residents -- as many as a few hundred people -- were buried, just one piece of the devastation from two large earthquakes that struck Indonesia in as many days. The stench of dead bodies fills the air. Indonesia's health ministry and ministry of social affairs said Friday they believe thousands remain buried beneath rubble. The West Sumatran capital, Padang, with about a million residents, is near the epicenter. CNN's Arwa Damon spoke with a few dozen survivors from these villages in the area, most of whom only made it through because they weren't home during the quake. They remained huddled together in a tent, in shock over what had happened. One older woman said eight of her family members were buried. She had been buried up to her chest and had to dig herself out. Another survivor, a 27-year-old man, told CNN four of his family members were killed. His home used to be on top of a cliff in the area. Now, there is only mud. Search and rescue teams are working with the military, but so far, only 25 bodies have been recovered. With each passing day, the scope of the devastation grows.  Watch aftermath at house leveled by quake » . President Obama spoke with Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono on Friday after trying several times to reach him, the White House said. Obama received an update on the situation on the ground from Yudhoyono in the five-minute call. The White House statement says Obama ""offered, on behalf of the United States, to do everything we can to help alleviate the suffering and provide assistance to the relief operation."" The U.N.'s Holmes told reporters Thursday that hundreds are believed to be injured. ""These numbers, I fear, will rise as more information becomes available,"" he added. Telecommunications are difficult in the region, roads are cut off, and the hardest-hit area, including Padang, lacks power and other services, Holmes said. In addition, heavy rainfall has hindered search and rescue efforts. Some have suggested the damage may be worse than that of a 6.3-magnitude quake centered in the central Java city of Yogyakarta in May 2006, Holmes said. That temblor killed more than 5,000 people and triggered fears of an eruption from a nearby volcano. Many people wandered the streets of Padang stunned and dazed. Some searched the rubble for survivors. Staff at a local hospital treated the injured outside the semi-collapsed building as bodies of the dead lay in makeshift morgues. Several of the hospital's buildings were severely damaged. Damage in the town itself was spotty; some buildings remained intact near others in ruins. ""Aftershocks can be just as devastating as the initial quake,"" said Adjie Fachrurrazi, emergency response coordinator in Indonesia for the CARE aid organization, in a statement. ""After an earthquake of this size, we know the immediate needs are going to be getting safe water, food and emergency supplies to the survivors. The question now is: How bad is it? We're hoping for the best, but the information so far is not looking good."" Amelia Merrick, the operations director for World Vision Indonesia, described the situation as ""quite devastating."" ""Bridges have gone down, phone lines are in total disrepair,"" she said. ""It's difficult for us to assess the situation."" Earlier this month, an earthquake in West Java killed 57 people.

"NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN) -- Before a cheering crowd at a town hall meeting in New Orleans, President Obama fired back at critics who accuse him of accomplishing little in his nine months in office, saying ""I'm just getting started."" President Obama speaks at a town hall meeting at the University of New Orleans on Thursday. ""I never thought any of this was going to be easy,"" said Obama, speaking at the University of New Orleans in his first visit to the Gulf Coast city since taking office. He poked fun at his critics, asking, ""Why haven't you solved world hunger yet? It's been nine months. Why?"" ""What'd I say during the campaign? I said change is hard,"" Obama said. ""Big change is harder. ... I wasn't kidding about it being hard."" ""Those folks who are trying to stand in the way of progress ... let me tell you, I'm just getting started,"" he said. ""I don't quit. I'm not tired. I'm just getting started."" Before taking questions, Obama discussed the recovery effort in New Orleans, a city struggling to get back on its feet after Hurricane Katrina. ""It has now been just over four years since that terrible storm struck your shores,"" the president said. ""And [in] the days after it did, this nation and all the world bore witness to the fact that the damage from Katrina was not caused just by a disaster of nature, but also by a breakdown of government, that government wasn't adequately prepared and we didn't appropriately respond."" Obama said that when he took office, he pledged to make Gulf Coast rebuilding efforts and disaster response top priorities of his administration. ""So far, I'm pleased to report that we've made good progress,"" he said. ""We've got a long way to go, but we've made progress."" He said he has sent more Cabinet members to the Gulf Coast than any other region -- ""not just to appearances, but to listen and to learn and help you move forward."" Also, he said, his administration has helped eliminate red tape and turf disputes in order to get stalled programs moving, and freed up $1.5 billion in recovery funds. He said his administration is tackling ""corruption and inefficiency"" that has plagued the New Orleans Housing Authority for years -- remarks that drew applause from the crowd -- and has helped move families out of emergency housing, helping homeowners rebuild and helping renters find affordable options. The government has also invested in supporting health centers and recruiting primary care providers, nurses and other professionals to fill shortages left by the 2005 hurricane, he said.  Watch bloggers debate Obama's handling of New Orleans » . Before the meeting, Obama toured the Martin Luther King charter school -- the first charter school to reopen in New Orleans' Ninth Ward, the hardest-hit portion of the city. The president called the school ""an inspiration for this city."" However, ""it's clear how far we have to go before we can call this recovery a real success,"" he said, adding that much remains to be done to repair roads, hospitals and schools and rebuild neighborhoods. ""We will not forget about New Orleans,"" he said. ""We're going to keep on working."" He also touched on the economy and on health care reform. ""Too many Americans have waited too long for this to happen,"" he said, drawing wild cheers from the crowd. ""We are going to pass health care reform by the end of the year."" Meeting the challenges faced by the nation, he said, ""requires diligence and perseverance and patience ... it requires a renewed spirit of cooperation among our citizens."" He took questions from the crowd on topics ranging from the school dropout rate to immigration. One man asked Obama, ""Why is it four years after Katrina we're still fighting with the federal government for money to repair our devastated city? ... I expected as much from the Bush administration, but why are we still being nickeled and dimed in our recovery?"" The president responded, ""I make no excuses for the fact that the federal government did not work effectively with state and local governments immediately in the aftermath of the storm to make sure that everybody got the help they needed right away. And we are still working through the backlog of problems that existed."" ""My expectation is that by the time that my term is over, you guys are going to look back and you're going to say, 'This was a responsive administration on health care, on housing, on education, that actually made sure the money flowed and that things got done the way they were supposed to get done,"" he said. A fourth-grade boy asked Obama his final question: ""Why do people hate you? They're supposed to love you. And God is love."" ""Well, now, first of all, I did get elected president, so not everybody hates me now,"" Obama said. ""... If you were watching TV lately, it seems like everybody's just getting mad all the time. ... Some of it is just what's called politics, where, you know, once one party wins, then the other party kind of feels like it needs to poke you a little bit to keep you on your toes."" In addition, he told the boy, some people have lost their jobs and are frustrated. ""When you're president of the United States, you've got to deal with all of that,"" he said. ""... I'm a pretty tough guy. Are you a tough guy?"" Four years after Katrina, evidence of the storm's devastation lingers. About 1,500 people in Louisiana are still living in temporary housing, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, although that is down from a high of more than 90,000. And the Army Corps of Engineers is only a third of the way through a $15 billion system to provide 100-year flood protection for the city. However, the agency says 76 disputed projects in Louisiana have been resolved since Obama took office, and more than $1.4 billion in aid has been sent to Louisiana, along with more than $160 million to Mississippi. And it says that more than 89,000 Louisiana households and 45,044 Mississippi households displaced by Katrina -- and by Hurricane Rita, which hit a month later -- have found longer-term housing solutions. The emergency agency also says more than $1 billion from the stimulus program has been targeted for New Orleans. The Obama administration's efforts have been praised. In August, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, a Republican, told the New Orleans Times-Picayune newspaper, ""there is a sense of momentum and a desire to get things done."" Still, the length and nature of Obama's visit Thursday drew some ire. The president was to spend less than four hours in New Orleans and will not visit other areas of the Gulf Coast affected by Katrina, such as the Mississippi coast. ""The people of New Orleans deserve more than a 'drive-through daiquiri' summit with the president,"" Rep. Steve Scalise, R-Louisiana, said in a news conference Monday. And Sen. David Vitter, R-Louisiana, wrote in a letter to Obama that ""if the town hall is the only major event of the visit, I truly think it will be deeply disappointing to most citizens."" The White House said that Obama has been to New Orleans five times since Katrina, and that since Obama took office, there have been 35 trips to the Gulf Coast by more than 20 senior administration officials. ""The president made a promise to come to New Orleans and wanted to fulfill that promise as soon as his schedule allowed,"" White House spokesman Nicholas Shapiro said.","NEW: ""I never thought any of this was going to be easy,"" he says at university .

"New York City (CNN)  -- Four years ago, the devastating Hurricane Katrina affected millions in the United States. The initial medical response was ill-equipped, understaffed, poorly coordinated and delayed. Criticism was fierce. The response to Haiti has been the same. The point no one seems to remember is this: Medical response to these situations cannot be delayed. Immediate access to emergency equipment is also crucial. Within 24 hours of the earthquake, Dr. David Helfet put together a 13-member team of surgeons, anesthesiologists and operating room nurses, with a massive amount of orthopedic operating room equipment, ready to be flown directly to Port-au-Prince on a private plane. We also had a plan to replace physicians and equipment -- within 24 hours, we could bring in whatever  was necessary on a private jet. We believe we had a reasonably comprehensive orthopedic trauma service; as trauma surgeons, we planned to provide acute care in the midst of an orthopedic disaster. We expected many amputations. But we thought we could save limbs that were salvageable, particularly those of children. We recognized that in an underdeveloped country, a limb amputation may be a death sentence. It does not have to be so. We thought our plan was a good one, but we soon learned we were incredibly naive. Disaster management in Haiti was nonexistent. The difficulties in getting in -- despite the intelligence we had from people on the ground and Dr. Helfet's  connections with Partners in Health and Bill and Hillary Clinton -- only hinted at the difficulties we would have once we arrived. We started out Friday morning and got a slot to get into Port-au-Prince on Friday. That was canceled when we were on the runway and was rescheduled for the next day. We were diverted to the Dominican Republic and planned on arriving in Port-au-Prince on Saturday. That Saturday morning slot also was canceled and postponed until the afternoon. The airport had one runway and hundreds of planes trying to land.  But nobody was prioritizing the flights. Once we finally landed, we were taken to the General Hospital in Port-au-Prince with our medical supplies. We had been told that this hospital was up and running with two functioning operating rooms. Once we arrived,  we saw a severely damaged hospital with no running water and only limited electrical power, supplied by a generator. Surgeries were being performed in the equivalent of a large storage closet, where amputations were performed with hacksaws. This facility could not nearly accommodate our equipment nor our expertise to treat the volume of injuries we saw. We quickly took our second option: Community Hospital of Haiti, about two miles away. There, we found about 750 patients lying on the floor. But the facility had running water, electricity and two functional operating rooms. We found scores of patients with pus dripping out of open extremity fractures and crush injuries. Some wounds were already ridden with maggots. About a third of these victims were children. The entire hospital smelled of infected, rotting limbs and death. Later on, we would judge our surgical progress by the diminishment of the stench. In our naïveté, we didn't expect that the two anesthesia machines would not work; that there would be only one cautery available in the entire hospital to stop bleeding; that an operating room sterilizer fit only instruments the size of a cigar box; that there would be no sterile saline, no functioning fluoroscopy machine, no blood for transfusions, no ability to do lab work; and the only local staff was a ragtag group of voluntary health providers who, like us, had made it there on their own. As we got up and running and organized the patients for surgery, we told our contacts in the United States what we needed. More supplies were loaded for a second trip. Those  included a battery-operated pulse lavage, a huge supply of sterile saline and the soft goods we needed desperately in the operating room. The plane landed as planned Sunday night, and the new equipment was loaded onto a truck. Then that truck, loaded with life-saving equipment, was hijacked somewhere between the airport and the hospital. We had planned to run a marathon round-the-clock operation and leave at 11 p.m. Tuesday. We worked for 60-plus hours without stopping. The plane that would take us home would bring with it not only a new medical staff, but also equipment that was nonexistent in the hospital, or even the country. These pieces of equipment, two of each, were urgently needed: portable anesthesiology machines; electrocautery machines to stop bleeding after amputations; portable monitors for the recovery room; autoclaves to sterilize equipment; and a lot of orthopedic equipment, which we were quickly using up. The other items were those that were on the previous flight and had been hijacked. Officials at the Port-au-Prince airport canceled that plane's 6 a.m. Tuesday slot, and the plane never made it to us on time. We had started to see daylight Monday night, having performed about 100 surgeries, which were mainly amputations, fixing broken limbs and soft tissue debridements. Many of the patients were children and babies. But on Tuesday morning, a huge number of new patients arrived. The Haitians had heard we were trying to save limbs, and families were bringing their injured loved ones to us. The hospital was forced to lock down, closing its gates to the angry and frustrated crowd outside. On Tuesday morning, we saw that many of the patients we had operated on were becoming septic and would require additional surgeries. We finished operating at noon Tuesday, our last surgery assisting an obstetrician on a Caesarean section and helping to resuscitate a newborn who was not breathing. We decided the situation was untenable. Our supplies were running out, our team was past exhaustion, safety was rapidly becoming a concern, and we had no firm plan to leave or resupply. A hospital benefactor helped us get to the airport. First, Jamaican soldiers with M-16s escorted us out of the building as the crowd outside saw us abandoning the hospital. We made it to the airport on the back of a pickup, got onto the tarmac, hailed a commercial plane that had carried cargo to Haiti and was returning to Montreal, Canada, and had a private jet pick us up from there. We were unprepared for what we saw in Haiti -- the vast amount of human devastation, the complete lack of medical infrastructure,  the lack of support from the Haitian medical community, the lack of organization on the ground. No one was in charge. We had the first hospital in the Port-au-Prince area with functioning operating rooms, yet no one came to the hospital to assess how we did it or offer help. The fact that the military could not or would not protect the critical resupply medical equipment on Sunday, or allow the Tuesday flight to come in, is devastating and merits intense investigation. There was no security at the hospital. We needed a much higher level of security with  strong and clear support of the military from the very beginning. The lack of support for our operation by the United States is shocking and embarrassing and shows how woefully unprepared we are for the realities of disasters. We came to understand that our isolated operation may work in a mission, but not in a disaster. We first thought we would support those at the helm but soon realized we were almost the only early responders with the critical expertise and equipment to treat an orthopedic disaster such as this. Still, nobody with a clear plan is in charge, and care is chaotic at best. Doctors are coming into the country with no plan of what they are going to do, and nobody directing them how to do it. Surgeons who expect to show up and operate will be  mistaken. Without a complement of support staff and supplies, they are of limited to no value. We left feeling as if we abandoned these patients, the country and its people, and we feel terrible. Our role back in New York is to expose the inadequacies of the system in the hopes of effecting change immediately. Patients who are alive and still have their arms and legs remain in jeopardy unless an urgent response is implemented. The quickest and most efficient way to really help now and support the medical staff on the ground is to assess needs, provide equipment and personnel in necessary quantities, and bring them safely and expeditiously into the country and to the hospital units caring for patients. Upon our departure, we witnessed pallets of Cheerios and dry goods sitting on the tarmac helping nobody. Yet our flight of critical medical equipment and personnel had been canceled, and the equipment that did get through was hijacked. We implore an official organization to step up and take charge of the massive ongoing medical effort that will be necessary to care for the people of Haiti and their children. And to do it now. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Drs. Dean Lorich, Soumitra Eachempati and David L. Helfet.","Doctors gathered sophisticated team and equipment for Haiti on private plane .

Chansa Kabwela, the editor of the Post, wanted to highlight the conditions in which women were being forced to give birth during a hospital strike last summer. She mailed pictures to government ministers of a woman delivering a baby in a hospital parking lot. But Zambian President Rupiah Banda described the photos as pornographic and Kabwela was ordered arrested. On Monday, a judge in the capital Lusaka ruled there was no evidence the photos were obscene or could corrupt public morals. He dismissed the case. Kabwela was out of the office Wednesday and could not immediately be reached. But as she exited the courtroom, she told Reporters Without Borders that she was relieved. ""My victory is also a victory for all those who suffered during the health sector strikes,"" she said. ""I am happy the court acquitted me. I had no intention of causing anyone any harm. The letter I wrote to the vice-president was very clear. I just wanted to draw his attention to the situation in the hospitals."" The month-long nurse's strike in June was over pay and benefits. It shut down hospital wards, turning away hundreds of patients. At the time, a woman's husband snapped pictures as she gave birth in the hospital parking lot after being denied admission. The baby later died, said the Committee to Protect Journalists. The husband gave the photos to the Post who deemed them to graphic to publish. Kabwela then included them in a letter she wrote to the vice president, the health minister and several non-governmental organizations urging that the strike be settled. Soon afterward, Banda ordered police to take action against Kabwela. Journalism advocacy groups believe Banda retaliated against the newspaper because of its frequent criticism of his policies. At least six members of the newspaper's staff have been physically or verbally attacked by leaders of the ruling Movement for Multiparty Democracy since the year began, the Committee to Protect Journalists said.","Chansa Kabwela wanted to highlight conditions in which women were being forced to give birth during a hospital strike .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- At least 18 people have been killed and 80 injured in a car bomb blast in central Baghdad as deadly violence returned to the streets of the Iraqi capital for a second day. The blast was caused by a suicide bomber who drove through the checkpoint, toward a government forensic office, Iraq's ministry of information said. Tuesday's attack followed three vehicle bombings near hotels in the city on Monday which killed 36 people and wounded 71 others. The latest bombings come amid concerns over security and fears of a fresh wave of sectarian violence between the country's rival Shia and Sunni factions as the country prepares for crucial national elections on March 7. The buildup to that vote has been dominated by controversy over the legitimacy of hundreds of candidates banned from participating because of alleged links to former dictator Saddam Hussein's regime. The 511-name ""blacklist"" issued by Iraq's Accountability and Justice Commission, which is charged with purging former members of Hussein's Baath Party from public life, includes many prominent Sunni Arab politicians. Banning such candidates has raised fears of alienating the Sunnis -- an issue during the 2005 elections that analysts say was a contributing factor to the years of sectarian violence that followed. Monday's bombings also followed the execution earlier in the day of Hussein's cousin and notorious henchman Ali Hassan al-Majeed -- also known as ""Chemical Ali."" In a statement issued Tuesday, the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad condemned the attacks on the hotels. ""The terrorists who committed these senseless crimes aim to sow fear among the Iraqi people. We are confident, however, that the Iraqi people will stand fast and work together to build their common future in peace and security,"" the embassy said.

"(CNN) -- Sri Lankans went to the polls on Tuesday in the island nation's first peacetime presidential election in 26 years, despite explosions and mortar fire in the capital of Northern Province hours before polls opened. Once a stronghold for the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the Northern Province city of Jaffna was a frequent battleground for the rebels and Sri Lankan government troops until a government offensive last year crushed the Tigers. While it wasn't clear what the explosions were, they were nothing new for Jaffnans, who have lived under military control for decades. More than 14 million Sri Lankans are expected to elect their sixth executive president to a six-year term. Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa is seeking a fresh mandate for his government, but he faces a tough challenge from his one-time confidante and former Army commander, retired General Sarath Fonseka. Rajapaksa cast his vote in his ancestral town of Medamulana, near the southern town of Tangalle. ""I am very confident of victory,"" he told journalists. Fonseka was expected to visit a polling booth in Colombo. Queues were large outside most polling booths in Colombo and principal towns, election officials said. ""I waited in a queue for 45 minutes before I could cast my ballot,"" said Damayantha Perera of the Colombo suburb of Maharagama. ""I also had to wait for almost an hour,"" said W. Ramiah, a resident of Nugegoda, also of Colombo. Fonseka, who won wide acclaim for leading troops to military victory against the rebels, broke ranks with the Rajapaksa administration after he was elevated to the largely ceremonial post of chief of defense staff in July after retiring as Army commander. After Fonseka announced his presidential bid, the main opposition parties -- with widely diverse political ideologies -- closed ranks behind him to make him their common candidate. ""There has been abuse of power, corruption and nepotism. We want to abolish the executive presidency and make the parliament more answerable to the people. The best person to do this is the one who defeated terrorism,"" Ranil Wickremesinghe, leader of the United National Party, told CNN. Many of Rajapaksa's family members, including his brothers, hold key positions in the government: Chamal is a Cabinet minister, Gotabhaya is Defense Secretary, and Basil is a member of parliament and senior presidential adviser. Other members of the family hold important positions locally and in Sri Lanka's diplomatic missions abroad. The coalition of parties backing Fonseka includes a main opposition right wing party and a leftist Marxist outfit, as well as the Tamil National Alliance. Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu of the Center for Policy Alternatives, a branch of the Centre for Monitoring Election Violence, said the situation in Sri Lanka, however, is ""a picture of dysfunction and breakdown."" There have been allegations of interference with mail-in ballots, according to the group. Most of the complaints have been against members of Rajapaksa's government, it said. There have been more than 700 reports of violence ahead of the election, with at least four deaths reported, Saravanamuttu said. Sri Lankans are casting their ballots in more than 11,000 voting booths across the nation. Local leaders have urged a peaceful voting day amid the escalating violence, including the shooting deaths of two people -- one a supporter of the opposition and the other of the government. A contingent of 85,000 police officers have been deployed to maintain law and order, said Mahinda Balasooriya, the inspector general of police. Each polling station has two to three police officers on duty, he said. The spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said last week that the U.N. chief was ""concerned about the growing violence in the lead-up to the presidential election."" ""The peaceful conduct of the first post-conflict national election is of the highest importance for long-term peace and reconciliation in Sri Lanka,"" he added. CNN's Sara Sidner and Iqbal Athas contributed to this report.","NEW: Queues were large outside most Colombo polling booths, election officials say .

"(CNN)  -- Calling the ruling ""huge,"" New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin on Thursday reacted to a federal judge finding the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' failure to maintain a shipping channel led to catastrophic flooding during Hurricane Katrina. Nagin said he hopes the court decision will ""open up the floodgates"" for others to file lawsuits against the federal government, including his Louisiana city. However, he acknowledged it's likely the federal government will appeal Wednesday's ruling. Department of Justice spokesman Charles Miller said in an e-mail the government is reviewing the decision and has made ""no determination as to what future steps it would take in this matter."" U.S. District Judge Stanwood Duval Jr. ruled that the ""negligence of the Corps"" by failing to maintain the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet waterway ""was not policy, but insouciance, myopia and short-sightedness."" ""For over 40 years, the Corps was aware that the Reach II levee protecting Chalmette and the Lower Ninth Ward was going to be compromised by the continued deterioration of the [waterway]. ... The Corps had an opportunity to take a myriad of actions to alleviate this deterioration or rehabilitate this deterioration and failed to do so. Clearly, the expression 'talk is cheap' applies here."" Duval issued the ruling in a lawsuit brought by six plaintiffs affected by the 2005 hurricane, who alleged the Corps of Engineers was liable for damages. The judge ruled against one couple, who lived in New Orleans East, but awarded the others, from the Lower Ninth Ward and St. Bernard Parish, damages ranging from $100,000 to $317,000. Nagin said he had thought the ruling was a long shot. ""This was a surprise but a pleasant one,"" he said. The decision applies not only to the six plaintiffs, attorney Pierce O'Donnell said, but also to some 100,000 homes and businesses in St. Bernard Parish and the Lower Ninth Ward. Under the precedent set by Duval's ruling, they too will be entitled to compensation, O'Donnell said. At a news conference Thursday, Craig Taffaro, president of St. Bernard Parish, said, ""It's a bittersweet victory in the sense that yes, we are at the table, yes, we are grateful for the judge's ruling and for the legal team to deliver us to this point, but what a shame that we had to go through such devastation and destruction to get here."" At one point a Category 5 hurricane, Katrina had weakened to a Category 3 storm with top sustained winds of 127 mph when it made landfall on the morning of August 29, 2005, between Grand Isle, Louisiana, and the mouth of Mississippi River. Its winds were only slightly diminished when it passed over more populated coastal areas hours later. More than 1,800 people died in the storm, including nearly 1,600 in Louisiana. In New Orleans, the city's levee system failed and widespread flooding occurred. Overall, the storm damage covered more than 90,000 square miles and displaced nearly 300,000 people, causing more than $81 billion in damage. Ivor van Heerden, a researcher who warned of the potential for catastrophic damage from a hurricane, said the ruling is ""total vindication for everybody who was involved."" ""I think he's called a spade a spade,"" van Heerden told CNN by phone. The former deputy director of the Louisiana State University Hurricane Center said the university fired him because of the investigation he led into the levee failures. The probe put much of the blame for the disaster on the Corps of Engineers. He alleged Thursday that the university blocked him from being an expert witness in the case, but said he ""put together a lot of the science"" and reviewed the defense's explanation to find the holes. ""Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans was a manmade catastrophe with a hurricane trigger,"" he said. ""I saw the suffering of the people in New Orleans. ... Finally there is the potential of compensation."" He said he intends to file a lawsuit against LSU, which he said has to pay him through the end of his contract, which ends in May. LSU did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment Thursday. CNN's Ashley Hayes contributed to this report.","Judge: Army Corps of Engineers liable for catastrophic flooding during Katrina .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- A man charged with stalking sports reporter Erin Andrews is now accused of making nude videotapes of her in one more city than previously thought, according to court documents filed Wednesday. Michael David Barrett, 48, is accused of surreptitiously videotaping the ESPN reporter through hotel peepholes and posting the videos online. Authorities previously had said they believed most of the videos were made at a Nashville, Tennessee, hotel in September 2008. But the information filed Wednesday alleges that Barrett also taped Andrews through an altered peephole in a hotel room in Columbus, Ohio, in February 2008. Barrett stayed in the hotel room next door to Andrews, the information said. He is charged with interstate stalking, which carries a potential sentence of five years in prison, said Thom Mrozek, spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Central District of California. Barrett was arrested in Illinois, but will make an initial appearance in federal court in Los Angeles on Friday, Mrozek said. He is scheduled to be arraigned on November 23 and will be asked to enter a plea. An Illinois judge last month released Barrett on bail. Barrett waived his right to be indicted by a grand jury, Mrozek said, and authorities on Wednesday filed a criminal information against him in place of an indictment. Investigators found that Barrett reserved a room at a Milwaukee, Wisconsin, hotel where Andrews was staying in July 2008, but did not check in, according to prosecutors and the initial criminal complaint against him last month. The complaint accused him of making seven videos from the surreptitious tapes. In Nashville, the door peephole into Andrews' room was altered with a hacksaw, and the peephole to her room in Milwaukee was altered in a similar way, the criminal complaint said. Authorities believe the videos were taken with a cell phone camera. In addition, the complaint said that Barrett ""traveled from Illinois to Victim Andrews' home state"" in August 2008, but did not specify which state. Barrett allegedly attempted to sell the videos to celebrity gossip site TMZ in January 2009. TMZ did not purchase the images, but employees of the Web site assisted in the investigation by providing information to Andrews' attorneys, authorities said. However, the videos were posted to other Web sites by Barrett, the criminal complaint said, with labels like ""Sexy and hot blonde sports celebrity shows us her all."" Andrews, 31, is a sideline reporter for ESPN, traveling around the country covering college football games. The criminal complaint said she became aware of the videos in July and that their posting has caused her distress, anxiety and trouble sleeping.","Man accused of surreptitiously taping Andrews nude, posting videos online .

"(CNN) -- A lock break occurred on the Ohio River near Warsaw, Kentucky, on Sunday, stopping barge traffic for several hours as the Army Corps of Engineers investigated. The lock break stopped traffic on the Ohio River about 65 miles northeast of Louisville, Kentucky. The incident involved structures, and there were no reports of injuries. All traffic on the river was stopped in both directions at about 9 a.m. ET, Corps spokesman Todd Hornback said. By 8 p.m., an auxiliary lock was set up to start allowing the half-dozen blocked barges through. ""It's going to take more time, but we're keeping the river open tonight,"" Hornback said. The river is a major artery for commodities shipping, with more than 50 million tons of cargo passing through the affected area annually, according to a waterways organization. It was not known what caused the break at the Markland Locks and Dam. Engineers were going to the site, about 65 miles northeast of Louisville, Kentucky, Hornback said. The lock's gates are 1,200 feet long and 110 feet wide. A smaller auxiliary lock is 600 feet long and 110 feet wide.  Watch traffic backed up on Ohio River » . A lock is a section of a waterway, such as a river, that is closed off with gates. Vessels in transit enter the lock and the water level is raised or lowered in order to raise or lower the vessel to adjust to elevation changes. One of the broken portions is known as a miter gate, Hornback said. The Corps of Engineers, on its Web site, says a miter gate ""has two leaves that provide a closure at one end of the lock."" They are so named because the two leaves meet at an angle pointing upstream and resembling a miter joint, the Web site said, referring to a joint meeting at a 45-degree angle, such as the corner of a picture frame. A public policy organization, in a February 2008 report, graded the locks' performance as a D, ""based primarily upon risk of failure due to unreliability of miter gates."" The federal government allocated $10.6 million to install new chamber miter gates, according to Waterways Council Inc., which describes itself as an organization ""advocating a modern and well-maintained national system of ports and inland waterways."" Hornback said the work was scheduled for 2011, adding that it's unclear whether Sunday's break will speed that up. ""The risk is very high that a failure of the lock gates will occur, forcing traffic through the auxiliary lock for an extended period, causing huge delays and costs to the towing industry,"" the council said in the report last year. Engineers hope to have the river back open as soon as possible, Hornback said, but an exact time frame was not known. Some 55 million tons of commodities pass through the Markland Locks each year, according to the Waterways Council. The principal commodity passing through Markland is coal, which fuels numerous electric power plants along the Ohio River, and those plants typically stockpile only about a 30-day supply, the council said.","NEW: Auxiliary lock used to relieve blocked river traffic .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- The Iraqi Olympic Committee said Saturday it stands by its decision to disband the country's soccer association -- a move that led to the association's suspension from international football. World governing body FIFA said Friday it had decided to suspend the Iraqi Football Association (IFA) because of the Iraqi Olympic Committee's move to disband it. FIFA described that as governmental interference. The suspension means Iraqi soccer clubs and teams may not play in international matches or receive financial assistance, though FIFA made an exception for Iraqi female players to play in a weeklong under-16 regional football festival in Jordan starting Sunday. FIFA said it learned Monday that the Iraqi Olympic Committee had disbanded the IFA and that governmental security forces had seized control of the IFA headquarters. FIFA officials gave the committee 72 hours to revoke the decision and hand the headquarters back to the IFA. ""The deadline has expired without revocation of the decision by the Iraqi Olympic Committee and the IFA has not been restored to its headquarters,"" FIFA said in a statement Friday. ""The FIFA Emergency Committee has therefore decided to immediately suspend the IFA until the decision of the Iraqi Olympic Committee is revoked and the IFA retakes possession of its offices."" The Iraqi Olympic Committee's actions are in ""total contradiction"" to FIFA statutes, which require national teams to have full independence, FIFA said. Two top Iraqi officials said Saturday the decision to disband the IFA was based on financial and administrative irregularities and violations, and that they were not surprised by FIFA's decision and had expected it. Samir al-Moussawi, a senior member of the Iraqi Olympic Committee, told CNN he was hopeful the issue could be resolved with FIFA in the coming days, and that the Olympic committee had international lawyers working on the issue. He denied, however, that government security forces had seized IFA headquarters, saying the men were protection services personnel guarding the building. Ali al-Dabbagh, the Iraqi government spokesman who has been delegated for months to deal with the International Olympic Committee, told CNN he will work on cooperating with FIFA's demands and holding transparent IFA elections. He said the suspension ""will not have a major effect"" on Iraqi football because the national team has no international matches scheduled over the next six months. It is the second time FIFA has suspended Iraqi football. The first time was in May last year, after the Iraqi government dissolved the national Olympic committee and all national sports federations. FIFA lifted the ban after the Iraqi government excluded the IFA from dissolution. Iraqi soccer has come a long way since the days of Saddam Hussein, when Hussein's son, Uday, was president of the Iraqi Olympic Committee and regularly threatened players with physical violence and torture if they played poorly. The national soccer team has continued playing, however, and has been viewed as something that has united Iraqis across sectarian lines. Although Iraq has not qualified for next year's World Cup in South Africa, the national team was able to celebrate becoming the Asia champions in 2007. In July, Iraq played its first home game since 2002, beating its Palestinian opponents 4-0. Tens of thousands attended the match in the capital after FIFA lifted its ban on international games in Iraq. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this report.","Iraqi Olympic Committee stands by decision to disband Iraqi football association .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Relations between Cambodia and Thailand took a further turn for the worse Tuesday, after ousted Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra arrived in Phnom Penh to begin his new job there. Thaksin arrived in Cambodia Tuesday to begin his first day as an economic adviser, a move that has infuriated Thailand. In response to the relationship with Thaksin, Thailand has suspended its cooperation with Cambodia, a Thai government official said Tuesday. Thailand has also suspended a memorandum of understanding with Cambodia, an agreement that governs an overlapping waterway between the two countries, said Panitan Wattanayakorn, a Thai government spokesman. Thai officials also plan to send out an extradition request to Cambodia for Thaksin, the spokesman said. The actions are the latest moves in worsening relations between the southeast Asian countries that were sparked by Cambodia's hiring of Thaksin. Last week, Thailand withdrew its ambassador to Cambodia and, in response, Cambodia pulled its top diplomat to Thailand. Cambodian officials said Thaksin arrived Tuesday and had a welcome luncheon with Prime Minister Hun Sen and the two were expected to have a friendly dinner later. Cambodia had not received extradition papers from Thailand, government spokesman Phay Siphan said. Thaksin, a billionaire businessman who served two terms as prime minister, was ousted in a bloodless coup in 2006. Thaksin fled Bangkok last year while facing trial on corruption charges that he said were politically motivated. Though he has fled the country, he remains a controversial figure in Thailand, and there have been violent clashes in the country between pro and anti-Thaksin groups. CNN's Kocha Olarn contributed to this report.","Ousted Thai PM Thaksin Shinawatra arrives in Cambodia to work as economic adviser .

"London, England (CNN) -- Irish football officials have lodged an official complaint with world ruling body FIFA after Thierry Henry confessed that he handled the ball in the build-up to the goal which sent France to next summer's World Cup. Television cameras showed Henry guiding the ball with his hand twice, before William Gallas scored from his resulting cross to give ""Les Bleus"" a narrow win in the two-legged World Cup play-off against the Republic of Ireland. ""I will be honest. It was a handball but I am not the referee,"" the Barcelona striker told reporters after the match in Paris. The Irish Justice Ministry confirmed to CNN that Dermot Ahern had asked the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) to demand a replay in the interests of fair play. ""Thierry Henry has admitted handling the ball, claims he told the ref he handled it. Millions of people worldwide saw it was a blatant double handball -- not to mention a double offside -- and we should put the powers that be in the cozy world of FIFA on the spot and demand a replay,"" Ahern said in a statement sent to CNN. ""They probably won't grant it as we are minnows in world football but let's put them on the spot. It's the least we owe the thousands of devastated young fans around the country. Otherwise if that result remains it reinforces the view that if you cheat you will win."" The FAI later confirmed that it had taken the matter to FIFA. ""I really believe the integrity of the game has been questioned last night,"" chief executive John Delaney told reporters. ""The governing body of world football have to step up to the plate and accede to our call for a replay."" Delaney said the FAI had also written to the French football federation. ""They need to look at themselves in this situation. Henry is their captain and a wonderful footballer, but does he want to be like Diego Maradona and his legacy to be this handball, this goal that got them to the World Cup in an unjust manner? If we had qualified in this manner, I wouldn't be happy,"" he said. ""It is up to the people who govern the game now. Every time I go to a FIFA congress I hear about fair play and integrity. This was a defining game with the whole world watching, and if FIFA believe in fair play and integrity, this is their opportunity to step forward."" The FAI has argued that there is a precedent for the result to be struck out, following FIFA's ruling that Uzbekistan had to replay a play-off against Bahrain  for the 2006 World Cup in Germany after the referee made a mistake in awarding a penalty. ""The Football Association of Ireland is hoping that FIFA and its disciplinary committee will, on behalf of football fans worldwide, act in a similar fashion so that the standards of fair play and integrity can be protected,"" the FAI said. FIFA confirmed it had received the Irish request for a replay, but gave no timescale on a decision. However, it said that under its regulations the referee's decision cannot be changed. ""Law 5 states that the decisions of the referee regarding facts connected with play, including whether or not a goal is scored and the result of the match, are final,"" it said. ""The referee may only change a decision on realising that it is incorrect or, at his discretion, on the advice of an assistant referee or the fourth official, provided that he has not restarted play or terminated the match."" Irish captain Richard Dunne, who spoke to Henry on the final whistle, said he felt cheated by the goal. ""He admitted he handled it, but it doesn't make me feel any better because we are not going to the World Cup finals,"" the defender said. ""FIFA will probably be happy. Yet again the big decisions have gone for the bigger team."" Football's international governing body had faced criticism from several Irish players that the seeding system for the play-off draw favored more powerful nations such as France. Blog: When will FIFA see what's staring them in the face? Dunne's teammate Robbie Keane admitted it was ""hard to speak,"" as he struggled to come to terms with the result. ""With the way we played, we certainly deserved to win the game and it killed us near the end with that handball,"" he was quoted by the FAI Web site as saying. ""I've seen the replay but we knew anyway (it was handball). You could see by the reaction of the players, especially Shay (Given) who was two yards away from it. You don't get a reaction like that. It was a clear handball. ""He (Henry) almost caught the ball and actually ran into the net with it. We're devastated."" Ireland team manager Giovanni Trapattoni told reporters that the referee had time to ask the linesman and then Henry. ""It would not have been the first time a player would have asked and it would not have been out of turn. ""We are angry,"" the Italian continued. ""It is a bitter evening for me. I would prefer to have gone out on penalties."" Fanzone: Five of football's most famous injustices . But former France international David Ginola was emphatic that Henry should not have ""owned up."" ""You don't do that,"" he told CNN. ""Henry was doing his job. You can't blame him for doing everything he could for his team and country to get them to South Africa. ""But it was a shame to finish the game like that as Ireland had played very well. ""Referees need more help on the pitch, so as not to allow things like that. Obviously the referee was not well-positioned and couldn't see."" English Referees Union chief Alan Leighton told CNN that Swedish official Martin Hansson had clearly missed a huge decision. ""I think the incident was more of instinct than deliberately attempting to cheat but it does seem that the ball hit his hand twice and therefore there is an issue."" But on the wider issue of cheating, Leighton said: ""It is all very well to blame the referees for not spotting it but fundamentally it starts with the players. ""I think the players have to think about the game, think about the reputation of the game and their own reputations and say look actually there is a line that we will not cross.""","NEW: Republic of Ireland officials lodge official complaint with world ruling body FIFA .

"(CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and foreign ministers from more than a dozen countries met Monday to discuss how to rebuild Haiti after the devastating January 12 earthquake. Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive also attended the one-day meeting of the Friends of Haiti group of nations in Montreal, Quebec. The United Nations, International Monetary Fund, World Bank and European Union also sent representatives, according to Canada's Foreign Ministry. In Haiti, desperate residents of Port-au-Prince, the capital, waited for two hours in lines around the heavily damaged Presidential Palace to get their first relief supplies, bags of rice or beans. U.N. troops brandishing automatic weapons kept order. Any spilled food prompted fast scavenging by those hanging around the distribution point. One woman, Via Maria Rosile, took off her shirt to collect a small pile of dropped beans. Watch images of a shattered palace . ""I am very unhappy,"" Rosile said. ""So far, until now we have received nothing."" The aim of the Montreal meeting is to develop a strategy for early recovery and longer-term reconstruction of Haiti. Once the strategy is set, a donors' conference to secure funding would take place. Clinton told reporters traveling with her to the meeting that the donors' conference would take place in ""the next 30 to 60 days."" ""There's a tremendous desire to help, but we've got to create the mechanisms so that it can be done effectively, and we've got to get the Haitian government's capacity to lead put together,"" she said. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper told the meeting's attendees that the challenge is enormous. Interactive map:  Where to find aid . ""It is not an exaggeration to say that 10 years of hard work awaits the world in Haiti,"" he said, according to CNN affiliate CTV, a Canadian television network.  He noted the initial outpouring of money and relief aid for Haiti, which he called generous in the face of human catastrophe. ""The difficulty we face, then, is not one of concern but rather one of coordination,"" Harper said. ""We must ensure that every resource committed -- every relief worker, every vehicle, every dollar -- is used as effectively as possible."" The United States has committed $100 million in emergency aid to Haiti, and Clinton said Monday ""there will be more to come."" At the same time, Clinton noted to reporters that even before the quake, Haiti had an economic development plan worked out with the United Nations and others that was intended to modernize the economy after decades of political and social instability. The earthquake required a revision of the plan, rather than scrapping it entirely, she said. ""It was a legitimate plan. It was done in conjunction with other international donors, with the United Nations,"" Clinton said. ""And I don't want to start from scratch, but we have to recognize the changed challenges we are now confronting."" Bellerive, in comments at the meeting reported by CTV, also said Haiti must achieve a new development path rather than simply returning to the same situation that existed before the earthquake. ""What we are speaking about is relaunching our country on a path of development. It is not a question of going back to the status quo,"" he said, according to CTV. Port-au-Prince will have to be rebuilt and public institutions decentralized to meet the needs of the hundreds of thousands of Haitians expected to relocate to rural areas, CTV reported Bellerive as saying. In addition, Monday's meeting provided an opportunity for the donor community, the Haitian government and the United Nations to review progress so far in the delivery of humanitarian assistance to Haiti. A senior European diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity to reporters in Washington, said the countries attending the Montreal meeting want to avoid pouring money into Haiti in ways that previously have yielded little result. Priorities might include agriculture, reforestation and building new roads, with projects carried out in coordination with the Haitian government, according to the diplomat. The diplomat also said France is ready to host a donors' conference on the Caribbean island of Martinique. A spokesman for the Saudi Arabian Foreign Ministry said Monday that the nation donated $50 million to Haiti for relief aid. The spokesman, Usama al-Nugali, said the money has already been received by the United Nations. Monday's meeting came as Haitians reacted with anger and frustration to news that efforts to rescue possible survivors had been called off. Looking for loved ones in Haiti . Thousands of people pushed Sunday for rescue efforts to continue after a 24-year-old man was pulled alive from rubble Saturday, 11 days after the earthquake. He had no injuries, but was dehydrated. His brother said he had survived on cookies and beer from the store of the Hotel Napoli Inn, where he worked. He is recovering in a hospital. Families of Americans who were staying at the Hotel Montana started an online petition Saturday in an effort to get search efforts to continue ""until all the survivors are accounted for."" As of Sunday morning, 2,395 people had signed the petition and sent 6,216 messages to the Senate, Congress and the White House, said Sue Keller, a friend of a family whose relatives are among the missing. So far, 59 Americans, including three children, are confirmed dead in the magnitude-7.0 earthquake, the U.S. State Department said Monday. The deaths include one U.S. embassy employee, previously identified as Victoria DeLong, and three children of embassy employees, according to Assistant Secretary of State P.J. Crowley. Another 37 Americans are presumed dead, Crowley said. About 11,500 Americans and some of their Haitian family members, who had medical emergencies or other circumstances, have been evacuated from Haiti, according to Crowley. The Haitian government has said the earthquake is believed to have killed at least 150,000 people. Tired of stench, Haitians torch bodies in plaza . The rescues that occurred over the past week sparked hope among families of the missing. International search teams have rescued at least 132 people, the United Nations said.

"(CNN) -- World No. 2 Novak Djokovic was on track to defend his Dubai Tennis Championship title when torrential rain, thunder and lightning halted play in Saturday's final against Mikhail Youzhny. The Serbian led 7-5 2-0 when the heavens opened on the desert emirate and flooded the court, and after a long delay it was decided to resume play on Sunday afternoon. Top seed Djokovic won a topsy-turvy first set in 63 minutes as there were five breaks in serve overall, then rain forced a half-hour delay. He was 30-15 up in the third game against the Russian seventh seed when the weather intervened again, and umpire Mohamed Lahyani ruled that the court was too wet for further play. Workers tried to clear the water, but to no avail. Djokovic is seeking to avenge his semifinal defeat by Youzhny at the World Tennis Tournament in Rotterdam a fortnight ago and claim his 17th ATP Tour title. Youzhny lost to Robin Soderling in the Dutch final after suffering a hamstring injury, leaving him with five career titles.

"(CNN) -- Iran will not send its partially enriched uranium abroad to be turned into material for medical research, its foreign minister said Wednesday, rejecting a key plank of a deal designed to ease international fears that Tehran aims to build nuclear weapons. Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki said Iran might allow its nuclear material to be reprocessed inside Iran, the semi-official ISNA news agency reported. The deal hammered out last month with the help of the United Nations' nuclear watchdog agency aimed to reduce the amount of raw material Iran has to build a nuclear bomb. Tehran denies that it wants to do so, saying its nuclear program is to produce civilian nuclear energy and do medical work. The watchdog International Atomic Energy Agency said Wednesday that it could not confirm or deny that Iran had rejected any part of the proposal. U.S. State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said, ""This is the IAEA's proposal, and Iran has to give their response to the IAEA, and that's what we're waiting for. That's what the IAEA is waiting for."" But, he said, ""until the IAEA gets the response and formally says this is ... Iran's response, I don't consider a statement to the press necessarily a response."" On October 1, the IAEA proposal ""was accepted in principle by all the parties including Iran,"" Kelly said. ""And there was also an agreement that each of the parties would provide a written response to the proposal. ""Russia, France and the United States have provided a written response,"" he said. ""We expect Iran to provide a written response. And we expect the IAEA to pronounce on that response. So we will wait for the IAEA to make a formal response to this."" In a report published Monday, the IAEA expressed concerns about Iran's nuclear program. The Islamic republic's disclosure of a previously secret nuclear facility near Qom raised questions about the existence of other such facilities, and its delay in acknowledging the facility ""does not contribute to the building of confidence"" in Tehran, the IAEA said in the report. Tehran has not convinced the agency its nuclear program isn't military, said the report, published on the Institute for Science and International Security Web site. A source with direct knowledge of the report confirmed its authenticity to CNN. Tehran shocked the international community in September by revealing the existence of the nuclear enrichment facility. On Monday, Kelly said in a statement that the report ""underscores that Iran still refuses to comply fully with its international nuclear obligations."" IAEA inspectors visited the newly revealed facility last month, according to the report. During a meeting in Tehran, Iranian officials told the inspectors that construction of the site had begun during late 2007, the report said, and it would not be operational until 2011. However, the IAEA inspectors told Iran that ""it had acquired commercially available satellite imagery of the site indicating that there had been construction at the site between 2002 and 2004, and that construction activities were resumed in 2006 and had continued to date,"" the report said. IAEA member states also allege that design work on the facility, the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant, began in 2006, the report said. Iranian officials told inspectors that the nation has no other undisclosed nuclear facilities either under construction or in operation, the report said, and promised that any future facilities would be disclosed. A letter sent this month asks Tehran to confirm that it has not decided to construct or authorized construction of any undisclosed facility, the report said. Iran remains bound by the terms of a 2003 agreement under which it must provide information to the IAEA regarding nuclear facilities as soon as the decision to build is made or construction is authorized. ""Even if, as stated by Iran, the decision to construct the new facility at the Fordow site was taken in the second half of 2007, Iran's failure to notify the agency of the new facility until September 2009 was inconsistent with its obligations,"" the IAEA said. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has said construction of the facility violates U.N. Security Council resolutions, Kelly said. ""Iran's delay in submitting such information to the agency does not contribute to the building of confidence,"" the report said. ""While the agency has confirmed that the plant corresponds to the design information provided by Iran, Iran's explanation about the purpose of the facility and the chronology of its design and construction requires further clarification."" The agency is waiting for Iran's reply to its request to meet officials in regard to those issues and others, according to the report. ""Further analysis of the information available to the agency underscores the importance of Iran engaging with the agency in a substantive and comprehensive manner, and providing the requested access, so that the remaining outstanding issues may be resolved."" The agency encouraged IAEA member states who have provided it information on Iran to share that information with Tehran as well. CNN's Laura Perez Maestro contributed to this report.","Iran says it won't send partially enriched uranium abroad for medical research .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- ""Oh, the humanity."" When these three words were uttered by aghast radio journalist Herbert Morrison -- as the LZ129 Hindenburg airship crashed and burst into flames in New Jersey in 1937 -- it was seen as the end of airships. The other remaining Zeppelin-class dirigible, the Graf Zeppelin II, was destroyed by the Nazi administration who felt the materials could be put to better use with more conventional aircraft. The Aeroscraft ML866 is a prototype for future cargo vehicles that could have a payload of up to 60 tonnes . But, 70 years on, could the Hindenburg-style airship be experiencing a renaissance? There are two types of craft that are commonly called ""airships."" The first is basically a balloon filled with a lighter-than-air gas, with an attached pod for the pilot and passengers, and tilting propellers to aid with descent and maneuvering. These are known as 'blimps' and are commonly used for promotional activities, for filming sporting events and by law enforcement agencies for surveillance. But their limited payload make them unsuitable for other purposes. The other type of airship is the dirigible. Like a blimp, a dirigible airship is filled with lighter-than-air gas but it has an internal skeleton. This greater rigidity allows dirigible airships to carry larger payloads than blimps.  See pictures of airships through the ages. » . While the Hindenburg crash dented public confidence in the dirigible airship concept, the principal cause of the disaster wasn't bad design but propaganda. The Germans were desperate to show off their technical achievement. But the United States, the world's primary supplier of the inert gas helium (which was used to inflate and lift the airships), had imposed a military embargo on the gas. So the Hindenburg was filled with the massively explosive gas, hydrogen. And it exploded. Massively. In recent years the concept of the dirigible airship has been reevaluated because of the environmental need to find lower-carbon methods of freight transportation; and the military and humanitarian need to deliver supplies to remote locations not served by airports. One failed attempt to resuscitate the airship content came from the German company Cargolifter AG in the mid 1990s. It planned a large airship, the CL160, to be used as a transporter for large and heavy loads. A giant hangar, one of the world's largest structures, was built in Brand, near Berlin in Germany, for storage and manufacture of these giant craft. But Cargolifter became insolvent in 2002. The hangar was sold for a fraction of its construction cost and now houses an indoor water park. In 2005 the Aeros corporation of Montebello, CA. resurrected the airship concept. Responding to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)'s ""Walrus"" program the company was given a $3.2 million grant to develop: ""a very large airlift vehicle concept designed to control lift in all stages of air or ground operations including the ability to off-load payload without taking on-board ballast other than surrounding air."" What distinguishes a ""Walrus"" craft from a Hindenberg-style airship is that it would not be lighter than air. Rather it would generate lift from a combination of aerodynamics, propellors and gas buoyancy. This would allow for a quicker descent without the expulsion of lift gas, for instance. DARPA terminated the Walrus program but Aeros is continuing to develop the technology with a view to creating an enormous civil airship utilizing a glass-fiber and carbon-fibre semi-monocoque envelope structure. The planned Aeroscraft ML866 could be the next generation of corporate transportation. With more than 465 square meters (5000 square feet) of interior floor space, the ML866's interior could house a floating boardroom or an opulent flying home. Because it would be flying at a lower altitude than a passenger jet (6,000 to 12,000 feet, as opposed to 25,000 to 35,000 feet) the cabin would not be pressurized. The technological legacy of the Walrus program is the COSH (control of structural heaviness) system. By compressing and decompressing stored helium, the aircraft can become lighter for take-off and heavier for landing. If Aeros secure funding to develop the ML866, it would be offered with a choice of turboprop engines (for either greater speed or heavier payload). But could large airships supplement the role of large passenger aircraft? Flight International's technical reporter Rob Coppinger is skeptical: . ""Whether it is cargo, corporate or mass transpiration I think the issues with airships are; can [airships] carry enough people/cargo between two popular destinations and do it fast enough to carry a sufficient volume of cargo/people to generate enough revenue to pay for the development, certification and running costs? ""I think if it were easy to financially justify, they would exist already."" Coppinger concedes, however, that airships could have potential military applications. Aeros plans to begin testing a non-rigid airship, the Aeros 40D, in 2008 to demonstrate the helium compression and decompression system. Production of a prototype Aeroscraft ML866 has begun, with a test flight planned for 2010. ...................................... Are dirigibles just a load of hot air? Would you travel by airship?

"(CNN) -- A Saudi court on Wednesday sentenced a man who caused uproar by bragging about his sex life on television to five years in prison and 1,000 lashes, according to Ministry of Information officials. Mazen Abdul Jawad talked openly about his sex life on the controversial show. Mazen Abdul Jawad, a 32-year-old airline employee and divorced father of four, spoke openly about his sexual escapades, his love of sex and losing his virginity at age 14. He made the comments on Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation, which aired the interview a few months ago. Saudi authorities shut down LBC offices in Jeddah and Riyadh after airing the interview on an episode of its popular show ""A Thick Red Line."" Jawad was arrested shortly after the program aired and charged with violating Saudi Arabia's crime of publicizing vice. On the program, Jawad is also shown in his bedroom, where he holds sexual aids up to the camera. The room is decorated with Mickey Mouse and stuffed bears in sexually suggestive positions. The cameras gave audiences a glimpse of the room's nightclub-like chandeliers mixed with seafood-shaped wall sconces, perfume bottles and a book in Arabic, ""101 Questions About Sex,"" that Jawad calls his ""reference."" Jawad, wearing a red shirt, explained that he put his phone number and details about his car -- a red Mini Cooper -- on his mobile phone's Bluetooth. He says women usually call him to ask if the car is for sale but, he boasts, ""some go out with me that same night."" The episode ended with him cruising the streets of Jeddah in his car looking for women. The show that aired Jawad's story is as popular as it is controversial in the Middle East. It tackles taboos sometimes never discussed in public. In one instance, a guest admitted he put up his children for sale and tried to justify why he continued to look for the highest bidder even though his kids were begging him to change his mind. Most guests wear sunglasses, wigs and strange clothing to disguise their identities as their lives can be endangered for talking about such taboo subjects. Surprisingly, Jawad did not disguise his identity on the program.  Watch report on the uproar over the broadcast » . The episode caused an uproar in deeply conservative Saudi Arabia, where sharia, or Islamic law, is practiced. Pre-marital sex is illegal, and unrelated men and women are not permitted to mingle. The segment in question has been posted on the video-sharing site YouTube since its initial broadcast last month, and has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times. Speaking about promiscuous acts ""is a violation of the sharia regulations on the one hand and against Saudi customs on the other,"" police spokesman Suleiman Al-Mutawae told Arab News, an English-language daily newspaper in Saudi Arabia. Before Jawad's detention, Arab News reported that he initiated a damage-control campaign, apologized for his comments and was considering filing a complaint against the show's producers for presenting him ""in the worst possible manner by taking two hours of footage and condensing it down to a minutes-long segment."" Jawad's lawyer could not be reached for comment. The ministry officials spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity.","Mazen Abdul Jawad, divorced father of 4, spoke openly about sex escapades .

"(CNN) -- Prosecutors asked Wednesday for a 25-year sentence for Argentina's last dictator, who is on trial on charges that he violated human rights during his 17-month rule in the early 1980s. Former Gen. Reynaldo Benito Bignone is accused of torturing 56 people and depriving them of their liberty, as well as committing illegal searches. He ruled Argentina from June 1982 until the nation's return to democracy in December 1983. More than 100 people have testified at his trial since it started in November, the government's Judicial Information Center said. The trial is expected to last until March. Also facing the same charges are former intelligence chief Fernando Ezequiel Verplaetsen and ex-military officials Santiago Omar Riveros, Eugenio Guanabens Perello, Carlos Alberto Tepedino and German A. Montenegro. Prosecutors also asked for 25-year sentences for Verplaetsen and Riveros and a 20-year incarceration for Tepedino, the Judicial Information Center said. They want sentences of 12 years for Perello and two years for Montenegro. The alleged crimes occurred at the secret Campo de Mayo torture center in Buenos Aires, court papers say. Campo de Mayo was the main torture center during the 1976-83 right-wing dictatorship. Few who were taken there walked out alive. Up to 30,000 students, labor leaders, intellectuals and leftists who ran afoul of the dictatorship because of their political views disappeared or were held in secret jails and torture centers during the eight-year ""Dirty War."" Bignone, 82, has been under house arrest. He faces two other trials: in the abduction and disappearance of doctors and nurses at the Hospital Posada and of two soldiers when he was head of the Military College. The three-judge panel in the current trial was scheduled to hear testimony Wednesday from two groups representing Argentineans who were victims of the Dirty War. Trial will resume February 25 with the first defense testimony, the Center for Judicial Information said.","Former Gen. Reynaldo Benito Bignone is accused of torturing 56 people .

"RIVERDALE, Georgia (CNN)  -- In his darkest moment, Kenneth Brown lost it all. His wife and kids, the housebroken dog, the vacation home on Cape Cod all vanished when he was sent to prison for an arson in 1996. Kenneth Brown, a former inmate, learned to meditate during his nine years in prison. Trapped in his gloomy cell and serving a 20-year sentence that felt like an eternity, Brown, then 49, found himself stretched out on the floor. He was silent. His eyes were shut. His body did not move. Brown, a man raised as a Baptist and taught to praise the Lord and fear the devil, was meditating. ""I try to focus on the space between two thoughts, because it prevents me from getting lost,"" said Brown, who discovered meditation, yoga and Buddhist teachings three months into his sentence. ""This helped me stay on track and get me through prison,"" he said. Eastern religions encompassing meditation techniques have captivated hippies, 20-somethings and celebrities like actor Richard Gere. But since the 1960s, the art of meditation also has found a growing number of unlikely followers behind prison bars. The inmates say meditation -- an ancient practice that develops mental awareness and fosters relaxation -- is teaching them how to cope in prison. ""Mostly, the people in Buddhist community are going into the prisons, providing programs, and word of mouth gets from one inmate to another,"" explained Gary Friedman, communications chairman for the American Correctional Chaplains Association. ""It's a break from all the hustle and noise of the prison environment."" There is no group tracking the number of inmates converting to Buddhism or engaging in meditation practices. But programs and workshops educating inmates about meditation and yoga are sprouting up across the country. Meditation can help the convicts find calmness in a prison culture ripe with violence and chaos. The practice provides them a chance to reflect on their crimes, wrestle through feelings of guilt and transform themselves during their rehabilitative journey, Buddhist experts say. In the past five years, books like the ""Prison Chaplaincy Guidelines for Zen Buddhism"" and ""Razor-Wire Dharma: A Buddhist Life in Prison"" have emerged. ""This is transformative justice, as opposed to punitive,"" said Fleet Maull, founder of the Prison Dharma Network, one of the largest support networks helping inmates learn meditation and Buddhist teachings. Since its inception in 1989, Prison Dharma Network has grown from one person -- Maull -- teaching Buddhist principles to more than 75 member organizations corresponding with 2,500 individuals, many of them inmates. For the past seven years, Maull's group has taught a weekly meditation class in Boulder County Jail in Colorado. Some inmates follow Zen Buddhism, a practice that originated in China, and meet weekly to focus their minds. Others practice Vipassana, a Buddhist practice founded in India, which consists of completing hundreds of hours of meditation in a short period of time. Buddhism has gained momentum in the United States over the past 25 years, becoming the third most popular religion in America behind Christianity and Judaism, according to the 2008 report from the the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life. About 1.7 million Americans call themselves Buddhists, and many of them are converts, the study said. According to the American Religious Identification Survey in 2008, there were 1.2 million self-identified Buddhists. Some inmates, like Brown, may not label themselves official Buddhists, but they meditate, practice yoga and follow Buddhist principles on truth, responsibility and suffering. The practice of meditation seeped into the heart of the Bible Belt in 2002. The Donaldson Correctional Facility, a maximum-security prison in Alabama, was notorious for violence. But a group of male inmates, including several murderers, completed a Vipassana meditation retreat that required more than 100 hours of meditation in 10 days. One inmate, who was featured in the 2007 documentary ""The Dhamma Brothers,"" said Vipassana was harder than the 8½ years he had spent on death row. More than 120 men in Donaldson have gone through Vipassana at least once.  Watch a clip of ""The Dhamma Brothers"" » . ""They don't feel so close to exploding,"" said Jenny Phillips, director of the film. ""They aren't afraid to have conversations with people and to express themselves. They aren't always on edge."" Critics, including some prison officials, doubt that meditation works. They worry that it may be a tactic to convince parole boards to lighten a sentence. In areas that are heavily Christian, some wardens are uncomfortable with introducing Eastern religions. Alabama prison authorities were initially skeptical about meditation but next year will designate an open dormitory for inmates going through Vipassana, said Ron Cavanaugh, director of treatment for the Alabama Department of Corrections. He said corrections officers have seen lower levels of violence among Donaldson inmates who meditate. In California, a state where the swollen prison population has resulted in dangerously overcrowded prisons, teaching conflict management is critical, said Anne Seisen Saunders, a Zen Buddhist instructor who was raised Christian. Her Prison Meditation Project, based near San Diego, began a decade ago in one prison yard. Today, the program has expanded to five prisons, with an average of 20 inmates participating in each location. Last week, the autumn sky transformed from a deep purple to light blue outside Kenneth Brown's meager studio apartment. Inside, Brown sat on his bed, barefoot and deep in concentration, in front of a makeshift altar holding books a photo of the Buddha. Traces of incense billowed in the air. Brown, now 62, resides in Georgia to be near his family. He says he was wrongfully convicted of arson. In 2005, a Massachusetts appeals judge reduced his sentence from 20 years to nine. His body was motionless, his eyes closed and the palms of his hands facing upward. These days, Brown's practice of mediation helps him tackle the challenges of being unemployed with a felony record. The college graduate has been rejected from jobs catching stray dogs and cleaning hotel rooms. But he's got a lot to be thankful for: His daughters, his grandchildren -- and meditation, he said.

"LAS VEGAS, Nevada (CNN) -- The theater was packed as Garth Brooks shared stories about why he decided to officially step out of retirement after nine years. Garth Brooks played two secret concerts in Vegas earlier this summer. Now he's signed on for an engagement. Camera crews and journalists filled the front section. Executives flanked the sides. And then smack dab in the middle of the audience was a row of chefs, enthusiastically applauding in their toques and kitchen whites. Yes, the media was buzzing about the much-anticipated announcement, but hotel employees at the Wynn Encore in Las Vegas were equally excited -- maybe even more so, because of the part they played in persuading the country music superstar to enter into a five-year weekend residency at the establishment beginning December 11. This summer, as the media threw itself head-first into the death of Michael Jackson, the Oklahoma native quietly took the stage at the 1,500-seat Encore Theater in two hush-hush shows attended by hotel workers. One was an intimate acoustic performance; the other a concert with his full band. He sang. He charmed. He won over staffers who never thought they'd be caught dead tapping their toes to country music. And that, ladies and gentleman, exemplifies the uncanny ability of Garth Brooks to connect with human beings, and explains why he -- not Michael Jackson -- is the best-selling solo artist of all time in any genre. (You can look it up.) ""I think my gift truly is I'm an average guy. What I like, an average guy likes. It's that simple. The music that I love, I find that most guys around me love, too,"" he told CNN in his dressing room after Thursday's news conference in Las Vegas. There's a big old-fashioned star on the door that says ""Garth Brooks."" It suits him. Even though he's pushed boundaries and rewritten rules in the music industry, he's still an old-fashioned guy with old-fashioned values -- work hard, stay humble and family first. It's the latter that led to his decision to hang up his mic and his Stetson in 2000. ""We were retiring because I gotta get back to Oklahoma and raise my girls. Sandy and I were getting a divorce at the time, so I couldn't expect her to do my job for me any longer,"" he said. ""We told the people that's what I'm going to do, and the people -- 99 percent of them -- said, 'Go. Go do what you gotta do. We'll be here when you get back,' and we'll see if they are.""  Watch Brooks talk about new course » . Brooks' three daughters -- Taylor, August and Allie -- are now 17, 15 and 13. When he retired, he famously stated that he wanted to be able to drive his kids to school every day. His new Friday-through-Sunday gig will allow him to keep his pledge of seeing them off to class until they head to college. Of course, the commute from his farm in Owasso, Oklahoma, to Vegas will be made a little faster with his new private jet -- an 11-seat Challenger, courtesy of Steve Wynn, the billionaire CEO of Wynn Hotels. ""I don't know anything about jets,"" Brooks downplayed with a shrug. ""It's got a cool interior, cool paint job, I don't know. But it gets me here (to Vegas), and it gets me home to see my girls. And so in that case, it's fabulous."" ""He's been happy being at home, attending every soccer game and knowing what his kids like to eat for breakfast,"" said singer Trisha Yearwood, whom he married in 2005. ""We both came from a family where our parents were there every single day, and so we don't know any other way."" On most weekends, Yearwood will be making the two-hour trip to Sin City -- and every now and again, she'll make an appearance with her husband on stage. ""It's a 'Beauty and the Beast' thing, you know?"" said Brooks. ""I can start a song in one octave and end it up in three keys, not knowing that I've changed. She's precision -- perfect with feeling -- and that's impressive to anybody you bring out."" From time to time, Brooks will bring out special guests, but for the most part, it's a one-man show -- just him, an acoustic guitar and a bunch of great songs and intimate stories. And, of course, there's the audience. ""As long as my gift is here, as long as I open my mouth and it works,"" he said, ""then I think my job is to keep doing it, you know?""","Garth Brooks coming out of retirement to play special Las Vegas engagement .

"(CNN)  -- Federal prosecutors said Friday that they will seek the death penalty for a 22-year-old man accused in the shooting death last year of Eve Carson, student body president at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Police said UNC student body President Eve Carson was taken from her home and killed. A grand jury indicted Demario James Atwater on October 27 on federal charges of carjacking resulting in death, carrying and using firearms in relation to carjacking, being a felon in possession of a firearm, and possessing a short-barreled shotgun not properly registered to him. He also faces state first-degree murder charges in Orange County, North Carolina, along with 18-year-old Lawrence Alvin Lovette. ""Both federal and state law violations are implicated in the tragic events of March 5, 2008, and we will vigorously prosecute the violations of federal law committed in connection with the death of Eve Marie Carson,"" said Anna Mills Wagoner, U.S. attorney for the Middle District of North Carolina, at the time of Atwater's indictment. An autopsy report showed that Carson, an honors student, had multiple gunshot wounds when she was found lying on a Chapel Hill street. The autopsy report listed six gunshot wounds but said two of the wounds were probably from the same bullet. Court documents released in the North Carolina case said Carson was taken from her apartment and forced to provide her abductors with ATM access to her bank account before she was shot to death in the early hours of March 5. Applications filed for search warrants said a confidential informant told police that Atwater said he and Lovette entered Carson's home through an open door and forced her to accompany them in her car. The informant said she had talked with Atwater after a picture was shown on television of someone attempting to use Carson's ATM card at a convenience store two days after her body was found. The informant said the two men drove Carson to an ATM, obtained her PIN from her and then shot her. The witness told police that Atwater said the two got about $1,400 from Carson's account. Bank records show that was approximately the amount taken from the account over a two-day period, the documents said. Orange County District Attorney Jim Woodall has said he also will seek the death penalty against Atwater, according to the Raleigh News and Observer. Authorities cannot seek the death penalty against Lovette because he was 17 at the time of the slaying, the newspaper said. Carson's death shocked the community and drew national attention. An estimated 10,000 people turned out for a service in her honor. The Athens, Georgia, native was a pre-medicine student double-majoring in political science and biology. She was a recipient of the university's prestigious Morehead Scholarship and a member of the Phi Beta Kappa honor society, according to UNC.","Feds will seek death penalty for 22-year-old Demario James Atwater .

"Fort Hood, Texas (CNN) -- Army investigators on Sunday asked troops and civilians for help in the probe of a deadly mass shooting at Fort Hood last week, saying some who fled the gunfire might have evidence. ""The Fort Hood office of the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command is seeking any military or civilian personnel who may have left the scene ... with gunshot damage such as damaged privately owned vehicles, personnel clothing, etc.,"" investigators said in a written statement. ""CID is also seeking any military or civilian personnel who may have inadvertently left the scene of this incident with material that could be used as firearms residue related evidence such as shell casings inside the boot, etc."" The statement said such objects would help Army investigators and the FBI ""in their bullet trajectory analysis of the scene, to insure the comprehensiveness of the ongoing investigation."" Thirteen people -- a dozen soldiers and a civilian -- died Thursday in the shooting at the Fort Hood Army Post. Some 42 people were wounded, according to the post's public information office. It was unclear how many of those suffered gunshot wounds. Among the wounded was Pvt. Joseph Foster, 21, who was preparing for his January deployment to Afghanistan when he was hit in the hip during the attack. With his wife and 6-week-old daughter beside him, he told reporters gathered outside his home Sunday that it was difficult to accept such an attack on his own post. ""Not here at home -- but as we've seen, anything is possible,"" Foster said. ""We are at war."" As of Sunday, 16 gunshot victims remained hospitalized plus the suspect, Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, spokesman Col. John Rossi told reporters. He did not say where all those hospitalized were being treated. Of the 16, seven were in intensive care, he said. When Staff Sgt. Alvin Howard's wife heard he was hurt at the post, her feelings were ""indescribable,"" she said Sunday. Kaneesha Howard told reporters her husband was set to deploy to Afghanistan in January. In 2003, he was deployed to Iraq, she said. Daughters, Alanna, 9, and Kristen, 7, were shaken by the event. Alanna said of her younger sister: ""She started crying when we went to the hospital because she [had] never seen her dad bandaged up like that."" Howard was shot in the shoulder and was recovering in the hospital, his family said. They were unsure when he would be released. Rossi said Hasan, a 39-year-old licensed Army psychiatrist who worked at a hospital on the post, is no longer on a ventilator, but remained in critical but stable condition and in intensive care at Brooke Army Medical Center. Authorities have not identified a motive in the attack at Fort Hood's military processing center, where soldiers report before they head to war. Efforts to assist those affected by the incident, including family members of soldiers at the post, were ongoing, Rossi said. Fort Hood was awaiting the arrival of two specialists in child psychology and disaster management, he said. ""This is not just for those directly affected by this tragedy,"" Rossi said, noting that effects from trauma sometimes are not immediately apparent. However, he said, soldiers are trained to respond to violence by controlling and securing the scene. ""Their training kicks in, and that's what we saw,"" Rossi said. ""The troubling part of it is it happened here in our own house."" Army Criminal Investigation Command spokesman Chris Grey said Saturday that all evidence indicates that the suspect acted alone and there was no indication of ""friendly fire."" The processing center has been moved to another location so its work can continue while investigators work at the crime scene, Rossi said Sunday. He told reporters he did not know Hasan's schedule on the day of the shooting, but ""my understanding is that there was no purpose for him"" to be in the processing center. The remains of those killed are currently at Dover Air Force Base in Dover, Delaware, undergoing the same process as the remains of soldiers killed in Iraq or Afghanistan. ""These heroes are being treated the same way,"" Rossi said. Rossi said he had visited with Fort Hood Police Sgt. Kimberly Munley -- the civilian officer who confronted and disabled Hasan in a shootout -- and with an injured soldier. ""Truthfully, it was an honor just to be in their presence,"" he said. But, he said, ""I cannot tell you how many times they reiterated to me that this is not about them."" Munley has drawn national praise for her actions. Her husband has been brought in from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, to be with her, Rossi said. In a statement Saturday, Munley's family said she had undergone a second surgery and was in good condition. The suspect's brother, Eyad Hasan, released a statement Saturday saying the family was in a ""state of shock and disbelief over this dreadful news."" He wrote, ""I've known my brother Nidal to be a peaceful, loving and compassionate person who has shown great interest in the medical field and in helping others. He has never committed an act of violence and was always known to be a good, law-abiding citizen."" Eyad Hasan said the family has faith in the legal system. An earlier statement from another family member said Hasan, a U.S.-born citizen of Palestinian descent, had been telling his family that he wanted to get out of the military but had been unsuccessful in doing so. Rossi said Saturday that Hasan had a late November deployment date to Afghanistan. It was to have been his first overseas deployment. The shooting, on the nation's largest military base, sparked outrage. In his Saturday radio address, President Obama said it was ""an act of violence that would have been heartbreaking had it occurred any place in America."" But, he said, ""it's all the more heartbreaking and all the more despicable because of the place where it occurred and the patriots who were its victims."" Obama and first lady Michelle Obama will attend a Tuesday memorial service for the victims.","NEW: Soldier wounded in Fort Hood attack: It's difficult to believe this could happen .

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- International officials arrived in Iran on Sunday to inspect a newly disclosed nuclear facility near the city of Qom, state media reported. Inspectors from the United Nations' nuclear watchdog -- the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) -- will visit the installation to make sure it is being used for peaceful purposes, said Ali Akbar Salehi, the head of Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, according to the Islamic Republic News Agency. The three-day visit comes after Iran said Friday that it needs more time to decide whether to sign onto a deal that could help end the international showdown over its nuclear activities. That proposal calls for low-enriched uranium produced in Iran to be sent abroad for further enrichment and then returned for use in medical research and treatment. Tehran is studying the draft proposal and will have an answer next week, Iranian diplomat Ali Asghar Soltanieh said on state-run Press TV. Iran informed IAEA Director General Mohamed ElBaradei that it is ""considering the proposal in depth and in a favorable light, but it needs until the middle of next week to provide a response,"" according to an IAEA statement. Delegations from Iran, France, Russia, the United States and the IAEA met in Vienna this week to work out details of the tentative deal reached in early October. And France, Russia and the United States indicated their approval of the arrangement. ""The Director General hopes that Iran's response will equally be positive, since approval of this agreement will signal a new era of cooperation,"" the IAEA statement said. Tehran sent shock waves through the international community by revealing in a letter to the IAEA the existence of a second nuclear enrichment facility near Qom. ""It is important for us to send out inspectors to do comprehensive verification ... to assure ourselves that it is ... fit for peaceful purposes,"" ElBaradei said earlier this month. After the inspection, but before the end of the month, Iranian officials are expected to meet with the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States -- plus Germany to further discuss Tehran's nuclear program. Iran's leaders maintain that their nation's nuclear program is intended solely for peaceful purposes, but many in the West believe Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons capabilities. Low-enriched nuclear fuel can be further enriched into weapons-grade material.","NEW: Visit comes after Iran says it needs more time to mull deal over uranium production .

"Editor's note: Watch ""The Situation Room"" at 5 p.m. ET Tuesday for more from CNN's Brooke Baldwin about the dog rescue. Authorities raided a residence in Laurens County, Georgia, and found dogs scarred and malnourished. LAURENS COUNTY, Georgia (CNN) -- It was 8 a.m. October 15. Our CNN crew had been up for a while, waiting. We still didn't have an address. My producer, Susan Brown, and I had several questions: What would the living conditions of these dogs be like? What about the man whose door the Sheriff's Office was about to knock on? He was unaware of the raid that was about to occur in his backyard. Despite all of our planning, unknown variables were at play. First stop was the Sheriff's Office in Laurens County, which is in central Georgia. Starting with information from a tip line, authorities had uncovered clues that led them to believe they needed to intervene and investigate. The plan was this: The sheriff would drive to the property to execute the search warrant for particular objects generally associated with dogfighting, and for the dogs themselves.  Watch the dog raid unfold » . Expressing concerns about the conditions at this private residence where dogs were suspected of being bred for dogfighting, Laurens County Sheriff Bill Harrell said, ""If anything is going wrong, we want to get it stopped."" Private investigators with Norred and Associates Inc. will work alongside Harrell and his deputies, leading tactical teams. The teams were made up of veteran investigators donating their time, effort and expertise, along with volunteers of the Dublin-Laurens County Humane Society, who would collect and care for the dogs. All of the team members had experience with animals, particularly pit bulls. Based on information from the tip line, they were starting the day prepared to find as many as 60 dogs chained up in the woods behind one man's house in East Dublin, Georgia. These men and women waited, braced for battle -- only the war they were waging was on animal cruelty. ""I want to thank everybody for coming. It's for a good thing. It's for the dogs."" Chuck Simmons, a private investigator and former police chief, was mapping out the search area on a dry erase board. He was warning his crew about snakes, water from recent rains and nonsocialized dogs. After loading up crates on several trucks, everyone headed out. With the address of the raid location in hand, our crew joined a convoy of half a dozen cars down several rural roads to our final location. We arrived at a one-story ranch house with several acres of grounds. The sheriff beat us there. He and his deputies were already roping off this man's front yard with yellow crime tape. Rollin Monta ""Monty"" Loyd, the property owner, appeared furious. As the teams moved into the woods behind his home, our crew was stuck in front and across the street. We could not go on the property to get the shots we wanted, because that would be trespassing. We couldn't see the dogs, but we could hear them. The private investigators, who were part of the raid, videotaped the operation. Half an hour into the raid, reports began to come in. The good news: The dogs were still there; news of the raid hadn't leaked. The bad news: There weren't 60 dogs, as anticipated; there were more. The final count was 97. Most of the dogs were pit bull terriers; many were puppies. They were found cowering in cages or chained. Some older dogs were scarred -- possible signs of fighting, investigators said. Others were malnourished, simply skin and bone. Their conditions were atrocious, according to Terry Wolf of the Dublin-Laurens County Humane Society. ""Their chains are too short to reach shelter, those who have shelter. The water that they have seems to be recent rainwater with algae in it, and I've seen no food bowls. Most of them are very timid,"" Wolf said. ""They seem to be human-friendly, but they're attention starved, and they're definitely not socialized. You can tell they've been living hidden in the woods, out of sight."" Irene Sumner, director of the Dublin-Laurens County Humane Society, talked through tears, overcome before the count had been completed. She told us about a puppy found dead and tossed aside into a used plastic bag. ""I wouldn't do that to anybody. How can they -- what do you need 80-plus dogs for? There's no reason for it. It would be totally different if it was a kennel situation where they were housed, fed, vetted, all of the above. We don't know all of the information on that yet, but you can visually see that that's not the case here,"" Sumner said. The Sheriff's Office says no evidence of dogfighting or training was found on the property, but veterinarians will examine the dogs for any physical signs of fighting. Test results will take several days. As volunteers continued to count dogs and buzzards circled overhead, property owner Loyd waited out front with members of his family. He was angry. CNN tried to speak to him, to give him a chance to tell his side of the story. He didn't want to talk. Instead, he shouted to go see his lawyer. When reached, Loyd's attorney said: ""My client has not participated in dogfighting and is not charged with dogfighting."" Loyd was arrested and charged with animal cruelty. Neighbors and family members whom CNN spoke with came to his defense, saying Loyd loved the dogs and they were bred to be pets. The founder and CEO of the private investigation firm heading up this raid isn't buying it. Since the story broke about NFL player Michael Vick's dogfighting ring, Greg Norred has been donating his firm's time and expertise and his own money to rescuing dogs. ""I'm an animal lover. I've always been an animal lover. And in the wake of the Michael Vick case, I always thought there might be something I could do about animal cruelty, and with the type of business that I'm in and the resources that I have, it seems like dogfighting is the best vehicle that I can use to do something about animal cruelty."" In the past two years, Norred's team has volunteered for at least 16 raids. They've helped put 20 people behind bars and saved 200 dogs. Make that almost 300 after this most recent raid. Several hours into the raid, the first group of dogs was transported from the woods to an undisclosed location. A CNN crew was allowed to go but could shoot only from inside this building. Investigators feared that if there were any identifiable marks outside the property, someone might recognize it and steal the dogs. Authorities couldn't take that chance. But they did allow video of some of the dogs from inside the cages. They had taken many puppies, which looked helpless. Volunteers feared one puppy wouldn't make it through the night. The next step for these dogs is to determine which ones are healthy enough to possibly be adopted. Some, sadly, won't share that fate. They'll have to be put down.","The plan: Laurens County sheriff would execute search warrant on home .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Have you seen those ads being run by the debt-settlement outfits on bad late-night TV? Their promise is always the same -- to reduce your credit card debt to just pennies on the dollar without making you file for bankruptcy! Clark Howard says debt-settlement firms promise to help consumers lower their debts. Are they for real? It turns out that promise is just an illusion. Most debt-settlement outfits require you to pay an upfront fee, plus a monthly retainer. Their strategy is to get you to stop paying on your bills. They typically have you take the money you would have paid toward monthly minimums and stash it in savings. The basic idea is to make the credit card companies so desperate that they'll settle with you. This may end up being the end result, in some cases. However, along the way your credit suffers greatly. In fact, complaints about debt-settlement firms have increased dramatically in North Carolina, Florida and Oregon, according to The New York Times.  Watch how Clark helped a caller pay off a massive debt » . Many people wonder why these companies even exist. That goes back to 2005, when the bankruptcy laws changed in our nation. At that time, the giant banks that control the credit card portfolios stopped being cooperative with affiliates of the National Foundation for Credit Counseling (NFCC), which helps consumers manage and eliminate their debt. The banks were cynically trying to force people into a position where they had no choice other than to pay up. That environment created an opportunity for the debt-settlement firms to pop up with their false promises that they alone knew how to defeat the banks. The irony here is that the banks have now agreed to work with the NFCC again. There's an initiative known as ""Call to Action"" that is essentially a 60-month payment plan. Its aim is to help consumers who are struggling with credit card debt avoid bankruptcy. Under the Call to Action initiative, the 10 largest credit issuers have agreed to modify the terms and conditions of their repayment policies. That means they may waive late and over-the-limit fees, in addition to reducing interest rates. In industry terms, this kind of arrangement is known as a hardship debt-management plan. The goal here is to increase the chance that you'll pay off your debt instead of bankrupting out of it. But you've got to know that the lenders have not agreed to a reduction of your outstanding balance. Participating credit card issuers include American Express, Bank of America, Capital One, Chase Card Services, Citi, Discover Financial Services, GE Money, HSBC Card Services, U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo Card Services. Keep in mind that not everyone will be eligible to participate in Call to Action. Visit NFCC.org or call 800-388-2227 for more details to see if you qualify.","Most debt-settlement firms require you to pay an upfront fee, plus a monthly retainer .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- He's the other hero. After pulling child to safety, firefighter Jimmy Senk went back into burning building in case another was inside. Jimmy Senk is a Bronx, New York, firefighter who went inside a burning apartment with black smoke billowing out of the windows on Wednesday, pulled out a 4-year-old boy and handed him to a bystander. ""I'm just glad he's alive, you know?"" Senk told CNN. The boy has since been released from the hospital. The bystander, shopkeeper Horia Cretan, climbed four floors up a fire escape to try to help the boy before firefighters arrived. Cretan couldn't reach the youngster. But when firefighter Senk and his fellow battle blazers arrived on the scene, they sprung into action. Senk couldn't use the fire escape. Too many apartment residents were using it to get out. ""When I looked up,"" Senk said, ""I could see the boy's arm sticking out the window."" But the window was blocked by a bunk bed. Senk couldn't fit through the window. One of Senk's fellow firefighters put him on a ladder and got him to a different window. But then the boy did something unexpected. He disappeared into the black smoke back inside his bedroom. ""What am I gonna do now?"" Senk recalled. ""I masked up and went in."" Senk says there was intense heat. The smoke was so thick that he couldn't see a thing. He felt around for the boy with his hands. Senk found him near a doorway. In video that's been aired repeatedly on local, national, and international TV, Senk is seen leaning out the window and handing the boy to Cretan. Senk says he knew the boy wasn't in good shape. ""He was unconscious. The body was limp. He was foaming at the mouth."" ""I didn't think he was going to make it,"" Senk added.  Watch Senk talk about the rescue with CNN's Susan Candiotti » . He says he yelled to his team to get some oxygen. Then, thanks to the helping hand from Cretan, he went right back in. Senk said he had to. He remembered seeing that bunk bed. ""You see bunk beds; you gotta figure there's two kids in there, right?"" Meantime, Cretan said he was holding the boy. ""He was lifeless. I cleaned up his mouth and his nostrils,' said Cretan. He pushed on his chest and he says the boy opened his eyes. 'Once he did that, I was happy,"" said Cretan. Then, he carried the boy downstairs and into the waiting hands of firefighters. Senk didn't find anyone else inside the bedroom. When he eventually made it to the ground, his team patted him on the back. ""I said, 'I just hope that kid lived. And he [another firefighter] goes, 'He lived.' He was talking before he left,' "" said Senk. ""It was just incredible. I couldn't believe it because he was completely unconscious."" Cretan has been congratulated on several TV shows for his efforts, but he acknowledged the role firefighters played. ""Trust me. Firefighters are heroes,"" Cretan said. Senk says such rescues are a team effort. ""It's the greatest job in the world. You get to save lives every day,"" he said.","Horia Cretan became a hero for carrying boy from burning building .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- For the fourth year in a row, Iraqis top a growing roster of people seeking asylum in an industrialized nation. They are just ahead of people fleeing wars in Afghanistan and Somalia, said a report published by the U.N. refugee agency Wednesday. Iraqi refugees leave the plane after arriving at the airport in Hanover, northern Germany, on March 19, 2009. The refugee agency said 13,200 Iraqis applied for asylum. An additional 12,000 claims were from Afghans and 11,000 from Somalis. In all, the United Nations said 185,000 people filed for asylum in the first six months of 2009, a 10 percent increase over last year. Those people were fleeing homelands that also included China, Serbia (including Kosovo), Russia, Nigeria, Mexico, Zimbabwe, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The United States received the most asylum applications -- 23,700, or 13 percent -- while 38 European nations received 75 percent of the applications. ""These statistics show that ongoing violence and instability in some parts of the world force increasing numbers of people to flee and seek protection in safe countries,"" said Antonio Guterres, the U.N. high commissioner for refugees. ""There is an acute need for countries to keep their asylum doors wide open to those who are in genuine need of international protection,"" he said.","For fourth year, Iraqis top list of people seeking asylum in an industrialized nation .

"London, England (CNN) -- British Defence Secretary Bob Ainsworth announced a public inquiry Wednesday into allegations that Iraqis were killed and abused after a firefight more than five years ago in the southern part of the country. The allegations center around the aftermath of a fight in May 2004 at the so-called Danny Boy checkpoint in Maysan Province. Former detainees and the family of a slain Iraqi contend at least 20 people were killed and others were abused at Camp Abu Naji after a fight between British soldiers and Iraqi insurgents. That claim has been denied by the UK Ministry of Defence -- which says the 20 people died in battle and people detained were not mistreated. The probe is called the Al Sweady inquiry -- named after the family of the dead Iraqi. Thayne Forbes -- who retired from the High Court Bench last year -- will chair the inquiry into allegations. The inquiry will look into allegations of ""unlawful killings"" and the ""ill-treatment of five Iraqi nationals detained at Camp Abu Naji."" Even though the probe will focus on five detainees, attorneys claim nine people were detained and abused. The defense ministry disputes those allegations. ""We have found no credible evidence that those detained, as a result of the attack on British troops and the prolonged firefight at Danny Boy checkpoint, were mistreated,"" the defense ministry said in a statement. The release of a photo published in British media and obtained by CNN about the incident shows an armed soldier standing near four people face down on the ground with their hands bound behind their backs and their faces covered. Attorneys for the men say they were beaten and evidence shows a breach of the Geneva Conventions prohibiting humiliating and degrading treatment of prisoners. But, the defence ministry disputes that. ""It is important to remember that our first priority at the end of such attacks is to protect our personnel from further threats,"" the ministry said. CNN's Atika Shubert and Per Nyberg contributed to this report.","UK to hold public inquiry into allegations Iraqis were killed and abused after firefight five years ago .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- When it comes to bagging the best jobs behind the camera, Hollywood A-lister Charlize Theron says that women have to make their own luck. Charlize Theron in ""The Burning Plain,"" which she both stars in and executive produces. Indeed, the 33 year-old's career could be seen as a template for what women can achieve in the industry. As an actress, Theron is famous for roles in films as diverse as serial killer biopic ""Monster"" and Will Smith superhero movie ""Hancock,"" switching with apparent ease between small independent movies and big-budget blockbusters. Theron also represents a small minority of women who work behind the camera in Hollywood. During the 15 years she has worked in the U.S. film industry she has also produced four films. The latest is Guillermo Arriaga's ""The Burning Plain,"" which she both stars in and executive produces. At a time when women are picking up increasingly varied roles in front of the camera, statistics show they are failing to make the same headway behind the scenes. Last year, women made up just 16 percent of all directors, producers, writers and cinematographers who worked on the 250 top grossing films in the U.S. But, says Theron, there is no point in complaining about the tough time women have getting work behind the scenes in the movies. Do you think breaking through through the glass ceiling is still an issue for women in Hollywood?? ""I try not to kind of bitch and complain about what [women] don't have,"" Theron told CNN. ""It's a tricky thing because, I think, if you want to find that lynchpin, you can, in anything. ""I look at the work that I've done and I feel incredibly proud that I've had the chance and the opportunity to work on the material that I have."" Originally born in South Africa, Theron is best-known for her harrowing depiction of prostitute turned serial killer Aileen Wuornos in ""Monster."" ""Monster"" was also the first film Theron produced, taking a huge risk on a low-budget project with a script penned by a first-time director -- and with no previous experience of producing herself. Theron saw the film as an opportunity to move away from the lighter roles that are often thrown in the direction of a starlet with looks to spare. ""It's what I've been dying to do with my career,"" she told UK paper The Observer at the time. ""The work I've been doing the last couple of years is not really what I wanted. If you're not careful, you get typecast. I was getting stuck."" She was awarded a Best Actress Oscar for her role in 2004 and ""Monster,"" which was made for just $8 million went on to gross over $60 million worldwide. It is unsurprising, then, that Theron's attitude towards women in Hollywood is one of stand-up-and-be-counted. Although, she says that she will only produce films she feels she can bring something to. ""The things that I've produced have been because I really feel like I can lend some kind of knowledge to making a certain film. ""When I meet a certain director and there's a certain amount of chemistry and we see the same film, and we just kind of feel like we want to set out and make a film together, it just kind of happens."" Like ""Monster"" -- and Theron's other producing credits, Cuban rap documentary ""East of Havana,"" and indie drama ""Sleepwalking"" -- her latest film ""The Burning Plain"" is also by a first-time director. The difference this time is that Arriaga is already a well-established, Oscar-nominated Hollywood screenwriter. The Mexican filmmaker first came to prominence through his close relationship with fellow Mexican Alejandro González Iñárritu. Arriaga wrote the screenplays for ""Amores Perros,"" Oscar-nominated ""Babel"" and ""21 Grams,"" all of which were directed by Iñárritu. Arriaga, famed for his nonlinear narrative style, also wrote the screenplay for ""The Burning Plain,"" a project of such personal resonance for the writer that it was a natural progression for him to also direct the film. Despite Theron's success in bringing Arriaga's vision to the big screen, Theron says she is not ready to move into producing bigger films yet. ""There's no way that I, right now, could produce a massive blockbuster,"" Theron told CNN. ""I just don't feel prepared for that. ""I wouldn't produce something where I didn't feel like I had the skill."" However, Theron feels positive about not only her own position in Hollywood, but also that of her female peers in the industry, such as fellow Oscar winner Kate Winslet. ""I thought Kate Winslet did an amazing job. I do think that it's in our hands to make sure we keep working with the right people who want to go and explore those themes and want to push the envelope and want to tell great female stories.""","Theron says women must make their own success behind the camera .

"(CNN) -- Pakistan cricket is embroiled in a new controversy after the national team were accused of deliberately losing two games at the Champions Trophy by a government official. Younis Khan's future as Pakistan captain is in doubt following accusations of match-fixing. The chairman of the National Assembly's standing committee on sports claimed in a television interview that Pakistan lost to Australia to knock traditional rivals India out of the limited-overs tournament in South Africa. Australia won by two wickets by running a bye on the final ball of the closing Group A tie on September 30, which ensured they reached the semifinals and ended India's hopes. Captain Younis Khan then dropped a simple catch as his side lost to New Zealand by five wickets in Saturday's semifinal. ""We went with a pre-determined mind to lose the match against Australia,"" Jamshed Ahmed Dasti told Pakistan TV channel Geo TV on Tuesday. ""Our intention was to keep India out. It was a deliberate decision to lose the match against India."" Dasti said that the team also intentionally lost the match to New Zealand, who were beaten in Monday's final by defending champions Australia. ""That's why the NA Standing Committee on Sports has called in captain Younis Khan, coach Intikhab Alam and [Pakistan Cricket Board] chairman Ijaz Butt for investigations,"" he said. One report in Pakistan claimed that Younis and Intikhab had already been sacked by the PCB, but others said that Pakistan cricket's ruling body was happy with the team's performance. ""The team played well and tried hard. It is unfortunate they couldn't qualify for the final, which every player wanted to do, but they had one bad day against New Zealand,"" PCB spokesman Nadeem Sarwar told the Express Cricket Web site. ""As far as we are concerned, the team did well in the Champions Trophy and their performance was satisfactory."" Former captain Rashid Latif criticized Dasti for making serious allegations without backing them up with proof. ""I was one of those who first raised the issue of match fixing in international cricket, so I know what I am talking about. I can say the team did its best and played hard in the tournament -- a few mistakes cost them a place in the final,"" Latif told Express Cricket. ""I think parliamentarians should first look at the corruption in the government before talking about cricket. It is unfortunate that when the team needs backing, a parliamentarian should make such allegations."" The accusations are another blow for Pakistan's cricketing fortunes. The sub-continent nation lost the rights to host the Champions Trophy due to security issues -- it was postponed last year and switched to South Africa -- and was then ruled out of staging the 2011 World Cup. Earlier this year, veteran fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar missed the Twenty20 World Cup after needing treatment for genital warts. Akhtar, once Pakistan's most feared weapon, has constantly clashed with the PCB, which banned him for hitting a teammate with a bat in 2007 and threatened him with court action following a public feud which ended with a five-year suspension that he successfully appealed. The PCB also punished him for testing positive for the performance-enhancing drug nandrolone in 2006, while fellow fast bowler Mohammad Asif was arrested in Dubai for possession of illegal drugs last year.","Pakistan's cricket team has been accused of deliberately losing two games .

"(CNN)  -- The same day a cease-fire agreement was to go into effect, a high-ranking Yemeni official accused rebels of trying to assassinate him. Deputy Interior Minister Gen. Mohammed Bin Abdullah al-Qawsi told Almotamar, the newspaper of the ruling party, Friday that ""his car came under intensive fire shots in an attempt to assassinate him."" He added that he was in the northwestern city of Saada to inspect security forces and accused Houthi rebels of carrying out the attack, according to the state-run Saba News Agency. Also in Saada Friday, troops and rebels exchanged fire, killing one and injuring others, Saba reported. The rebels did not immediately respond to the reports, which followed the announcement of an end to a six-year battle between the government and Shiite Muslim Houthi rebels. Despite the reports of violence, the truce deal was still intact, said a Yemeni government official who is not authorized to speak to the media. A ""few skirmishes"" occurred, including an attack on a security official's motorcade, he said. He would not say whether that official was al-Qawsi. Such violence is common in the early stages of peace deals, he said. ""There are many reasons why this happened, and they were expected,"" the source said. ""One, some of the militia fighters have not been informed yet that the truce was executed. Two, there were revenge killings -- some of the Houthi tribesmen carried out attacks against government forces. These could be considered tribal revenge killings."" The government agreed to end all military operations against the Houthis beginning midnight Friday, an apparent end to violence that even tumbled into Saudi Arabia. Houthi rebel leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi earlier signed off on the cease-fire and took to his Web site to order his followers to respect the agreement. The cease-fire conditions include clearing mines, not interfering with elected local officials, releasing civilians and military personnel, abiding by Yemeni law, returning looted items, and ending attacks within the country's northern neighbor, Saudi Arabia. The Yemeni government official said rebels were expected to free seven captured Saudi soldiers Saturday. The revolt by the Houthis in northern Yemen began in 2004. The conflict is believed to be both separatist -- over who will have power in the area -- and sectarian -- whether Shiite Islam will dominate, even though the majority of Yemenis are Sunni. The rebels are supporters of slain Shiite cleric Hussein al-Houthi. CNN's Mohammed Jamjoom contributed to this report.","NEW: Truce deal still intact, a Yemeni government official says .

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- The father of a baby born with his heart protruding from his chest has told CNN about the 1100 km train journey he made to save his son's life. Chander Majhi's son was born with his heart outside his chest  and faces complex surgery. Chander Majhi, 24, became a father last week but he had to leave his wife behind in hospital and make a train journey from a remote region along India's border with Nepal to the capital New Delhi. His son was born with his heart protruding from his chest, an extremely rare condition called ectopia cordis, which only affects five to eight cases in one million live births. The parents did not know about the defect until the child was born on August 25 at a government facility in Majhi's home state of Bihar in eastern India. ""We didn't go for any (pre-natal) tests,"" Majhi told CNN. Doctors at the government facility referred him and the baby to New Delhi's All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). Professor of cardiothoracic surgery at AIIMS, A.K. Bisoi, told CNN the baby was admitted to the hospital with dehydration and a severe infection which he probably suffered because of the arduous train journey. Doctors were surprised that the child had been able to survive despite so many complexities, he said. Doctors at the state-run AIIMS are now planning a complex surgery on Thursday for the boy, referred in their records as ""baby of Vibha,"" his mother. His heart has been covered with a synthetic membrane and infected blood fully replaced from his body, said A.K. Bisoi, professor of cardiothoracic surgery at AIIMS. Surgeons may now plan a total circulatory arrest procedure that will also involve creating a home for the heart in the chest, said Bisoi. The baby, who suffers from immunodeficiency, will be put in a state where his blood will be cooled down to 18 degrees (64 Fahrenheit) for a half-an-hour stage of the operation, he explained. ""We could carry it out in one go, if the child is able to tolerate. If not, we will do it in stages,"" he said. ""We are working with hope,"" Bisoi remarked when asked about chances of success. And it was the same hope that drove Majhi to Delhi. ""That is why I am here. There's hope. My child is a fighter,"" he said. In 2006, doctors in the U.S. state of Florida carried out a similar operation on Naseem Hasni who was born with his heart outside his chest. The operation was carried out immediately after Naseem was born by caesarean section at a Florida hospital. Doctors wrapped his heart in Gore-Tex, a waterproof, breathable fabric used in outdoor clothing and medical applications. His heart was then wrapped in a layer of his own skin, to substitute for his missing pericardium, the sac that encloses the heart. The heart was then slowly eased inside.","NEW: Father speaks about 1100 km train journey to save his son .

"Paris, France (CNN)  -- Syrian President Bashar Assad says peace talks with Israel could resume if the Jewish state showed willingness to fully engage in the process. ""This peace process cannot only be relaunched by one party. Syria wants peace and we have a mediator, Turkey, which is ready to use its mediation role as well as the European partnership. What we are missing is the Israeli partnership, and we need it in order to renew peace talks and obtain results,"" Assad told reporters. Assad traveled to France, sat down with President Nicolas Sarkozy on Friday for a one-hour lunch, and held a press briefing, where he blamed Israel for the stalled talks with Syria. Turkey recently had mediated indirect talks between Israel and Syria, neighboring countries that have been adversaries for years. Among their many differences are Israel's occupation of the Golan Heights from Syria in the 1967 Six Day War and Syria's ties with Iran and anti-Israel militants. His visit to Paris comes days after the visit of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Questioned on Netanyahu's statement that Israel was ready to relaunch peace talks Syria without pre-conditions, Assad emphasized that if Israel is serious about talks, Syria is ready to send experts to Turkey and begin discussions with Israeli experts. Asked if he was ready to meet Netanyahu in person at some point without conditions, Assad didn't say he would or wouldn't, but said it would depend on the subject of the discussion. ""Are we talking about the menu or about land restitution? We must talk about territory restitution. For this matter, mechanisms and a framework exist. The negotiators know the mechanisms. It is neither me nor Netanyahu,"" he said. Asked about the role of France in the peace process, Assad said he hopes France backs the relaunch of the peace negotiations through Turkey and persuades Israel to accept this mediation process. As for the peace process in the wider Middle East, he said it will only work if Israel stops tearing down the other side's rights and demands. Assad said he and Sarkozy discussed living conditions in the Hamas-controlled Palestinian territory of Gaza -- reeling from the ongoing conflict with Israel, including the fierce Israeli offensive against militants that began late last year after constant rocket attacks on Israel by Gaza guerrillas. Saying a civilian was shot on Friday by Israeli troops, Assad said he asked Sarkozy to stop violence against civilians in the territory. Israel Defense Forces and Gaza security sources both confirmed an incident, but the sides had different accounts. The IDF said soldiers identified a number of suspected terror operatives who appeared to be planting explosive devices adjacent to the northern Gaza security fence near ""the Karni humanitarian crossing."" The soldiers opened fire and identified hitting two of the suspects -- one of which was transferred to an Israeli hospital; the other operative died of his wounds. Three other suspects were taken for questioning. The Palestinian security sources said a special force opened fire on a number of youths near the border fence with Israel in central Gaza. One of the youths was killed and four others were taken by the Israeli soldiers. Assad said he and Sarkozy also discussed Iran's nuclear program and Lebanon. Journalist Claire Boube contributed to this report.","Turkey mediated indirect talks between Israel and Syria, neighboring countries that have been adversaries for years .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israeli government ministers Wednesday overwhelmingly approved a temporary freeze on settlement construction in the West Bank in an effort to restart peace talks with the Palestinians. The Security Cabinet voted 11-2 in favor of the measure which calls for a 10-month freeze on new building permits and the construction of new residential buildings in the West Bank. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called it ""a very big step toward peace"" and said he hoped the Palestinians would ""take full advantage"" of the opportunity to restart talks during the 10-month window. ""I hope the Palestinians and the Arab world will work with us to forge a new beginning... for our children and for theirs,"" he said. In Washington, the top U.S. envoy for the region, George Mitchell, said he hoped to use the time to begin negotiations on permanent status issues, which include security for Israelis and Palestinians, borders, refugees and the status of Jerusalem. ""My personal and fervent wish is that we will, during this process at some point, have a resolution of borders so there will no longer be any question about settlement construction,"" Mitchell told reporters. ""It falls short of a full settlement freeze, but it is more than any Israeli government has done before, and can help move toward agreement between the parties,"" Mitchell told a briefing at the State Department. He said he plans to return soon to the region. Mitchell shrugged off a suggestion he might be discouraged after more than 10 months of failing to relaunch peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians. ""You can't take as final the first 'no,' the second 'no' or even the hundredth 'no,' "" said Mitchell, who helped negotiate a peace agreement in Northern Ireland and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. ""You can't get discouraged by setbacks and you can't be deterred by criticism. You have to be patient, persevering and determined."" Mitchell also released a statement from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, which said the announcement helps move the issue forward. ""We believe that through good-faith negotiations the parties can mutually agree on an outcome which ends the conflict and reconciles the Palestinian goal of an independent and viable state based on the 1967 lines, with agreed swaps, and the Israeli goal of a Jewish state with secure and recognized borders that reflect subsequent developments and meet Israeli security requirements,"" the Clinton statement said. ""Let me say to all the people of the region and world: our commitment to achieving a solution with two states living side by side in peace and security is unwavering,"" the Clinton statement added. Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, a representative of the Middle East Diplomatic Quartet made up of the European Union, the United States, the Russian Federation and the United Nations, called the announcement ""an important step towards creating the possibility for serious and credible negotiations for a two-state solution. ""The key, as I have said consistently, is to combine a credible political negotiation with real change on the ground, in institution-building, security performance and economic development,"" Blair said. But Danny Danon, a member of the Knesset from Netanyahu's Likud Party and chairman of the Settlers Council, opposed the announcement. ""If the prime minister will implement the ideology of the left, he will not get the support of his own party,"" he said. ""All the things he wrote in his books, said in his speeches, he so eloquently preached for, he does exactly the opposite,"" said Danon, calling the move a ""disappointment."" Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad said the proposed temporary freeze would be inadequate: ""The exclusion of Jerusalem is a very serious problem for us,"" he told reporters on Wednesday. Palestinian officials, including Fayyad, have called on Israel to freeze construction in Jerusalem as well. The Palestinians want Jerusalem to be the capital of a Palestinian state. In recent weeks, Netanyahu and other members of his cabinet have made clear that a construction freeze would not be implemented in predominantly Arab East Jerusalem. Israel views Jerusalem as a separate issue to be hammered out in final status talks with the Palestinians. The measure would not affect buildings already under construction for the existing Jewish residents in the West Bank, Netanyahu said. Construction of public building would also continue, government officials have said. The Israeli government is under tremendous pressure -- particularly from its ally, the United States -- to halt settlement construction in the Palestinian territory of the West Bank. Continued construction has been a key stumbling block in restarting Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. The Israeli Security Cabinet is a subset of the larger Israeli Cabinet. It has historically been used by prime ministers to approve quick action on defense and diplomatic matters. CNN's Michael Zippori and Kevin Flower contributed to this report.","Security Cabinet voted 11-2 in favor of the measure which calls for a 10-month freeze .

"(CNN) -- Did you know that there exists an all-natural remedy for memory loss? Weight gain? Macular degeneration? Prostate enlargement? These products are so successful that clinical testing has already begun! Just listen to the following testimonial from an unidentified person ... As these ads blare at you from your favorite AM radio station, perhaps you wonder: How can this be legal? Since the late 1960s, aspirin makers have been trying to win the right to tell the public that a daily low-dose tablet can help prevent heart disease. They have been told no, and no, and no again. Federal regulators are so nervous about over-selling aspirin's benefits that they have restricted statements about aspirin to the most bland and basic. Yet while the statements about aspirin have to be cushioned in the vaguest generalities, snake oil flim-flam can be huckstered in the most truth-defying way, thanks to a 1994 law coaxed through Congress by the people who make these drugs. The law bears the long title of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994. It was sponsored in House of Representatives by Rep. Dan Burton, R-Indiana, and in the Senate by Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Dick Durbin, D-Illinois. The DSHEA law draws a line between synthesized medicines like aspirin and remedies made from herbs, minerals, vitamins and amino acids. This latter group was recategorized as ""dietary supplements"" -- that is, as foods rather than drugs. ""Drugs"" are subjected to exacting scientific trial to prove them both safe and also effective. Sellers of dietary supplements are not required to prove that their remedies work. They are not even required to prove them safe -- as ""foods"" they are presumed safe unless shown otherwise. ""Drugs"" must disclose any risk of side effect. (That's why those erectile dysfunction ads terrify TV audiences with their references to four-hour erections.) Dietary supplements bear no such burden -- which is why St. John's wort can be sold as an anti-depressant, without any mention of the disturbing indications that the herb weakens the effectiveness of birth control pills. ""Drug"" advertising must be pre-approved by the Food and Drug Administration, which minutely reviews the ads' accuracy. Dietary supplement advertising is regulated by the Federal Trade Commission. So long as supplements avoid promises to cure a specific disease, their sellers can say pretty much whatever they want, provided only that they have some kind of supporting evidence on file. That evidence does not have to meet any kind of scientific test: pretty much any pattern of ink on paper will do the job. I cannot say, ""My rosemary-sage-thyme-and-oregano tablets cure AIDS."" But if I pay my cousin $100 to do a few experiments, I can claim, ""My tablets boost the immune system -- and clinical trials are under way!"" (There is an exception to the permissive rules about advertising natural products: wine. There is substantial evidence that a glass of red wine a day reduces the risk of heart attack. The laws of most states forbid any hint or suggestion that moderate alcohol use might confer health benefits. Still, if you ask the scientists, wine has better grounds to call itself a health food than does, say, echinacea!) Fifteen years after receiving the favor of Congress, dietary supplements have grown into a $24 billion a year industry. Most of the products sold by the industry are merely useless. For those who eat a balanced diet, scientists have found no quantifiable benefit from taking multivitamins. On the other hand, multivitamins probably won't do any harm. It would be better to give the $10 you spend on a jar of pills to the Salvation Army, but at least you are not poisoning yourself. The same could not be said, alas, for the unfortunate customers of a Belgian herbal dispensary who bought a supplement that contained the herb Aristolochia fangi. The A. fangi herb is rich in aristolochic acid, a carcinogen -- and users experienced an outbreak of urinary tract cancers. A. Fangi has since been banned in the European Union. It remains legal in the United States. As outrages go, Congress' special favor to the herbal supplement industry might seem relatively small stuff: a splash in the torrent of the $2 trillion per year that Americans spend on health and wellness. And yet in the midst of a great national debate over health care, this small outrage has some serious implications. Advocates for the herbal supplement industry justify their special sweet deal by championing the right of consumers to make their own ""health choices."" Individual choice certainly sounds like the American way. But the fact is that most of us are not well positioned to make intelligent health choices. If we try to play our own doctor, we are going to expose our health -- and our money -- to risk and exploitation. As individuals, we have trouble distinguishing between anecdotes: ""My neighbor took zinc for her cold and she said it really helped,"" and data: Most colds last four days, so you could smoke yak-dung cigarettes on day three and feel better on day four. We are poor balancers of risk: Look at the rising number of Americans who resist taking vaccines because of astronomically remote chances that something might go wrong. We are vulnerable to placebos: ""Hey -- I took the 30-day free sample and I feel sure my vision did improve!"" We are swayed by prejudice and ideology: The film-maker Spike Lee wrote in Rolling Stone in 1992: ""I'm convinced AIDS is a government-engineered disease."" The reason we should defer to experts is not that the experts know everything. Of course they don't. It's just that they know more than non-experts do. It's not that science has all the answers. It doesn't. It's just that astrologers, shamans, and natural healers have none of them. Americans spend over 50 percent more per person on their health than anyone else on earth. For all that extra money, Americans see very little benefit. Americans rank 42nd on earth in life expectancy, 29th in infant mortality. Improving and rationalizing this costly and dysfunctional system is a gigantic, maybe impossible, task. But one small reform could strike a meaningful blow for reason and cost-effectiveness: Apply the rules governing the advertising of aspirin to the advertising of oregano tablets. Repeal the DSHEA law and give the Food and Drug Administration full authority over every manufactured substance that purports to promote health or relieve illness. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","Consumers get constant pitches for herbal supplements as remedies .

"(CNN) -- Gov. Bob McDonnell of Virginia delivered the Republican response to President Obama's State of the Union address on Wednesday night. Here is a transcript of the speech. McDonnell: Thank you very much. Thank you. Good evening. I'm Bob McDonnell. Eleven days ago, I was honored to be sworn in as the 71st governor of Virginia. I'm standing in the historic House Chamber of Virginia's Capitol, a building designed by Virginia's second governor, Thomas Jefferson. It's not easy to follow the president of the United States. And my 18-year-old twin boys have added pressure to me tonight by giving me exactly 10 minutes to finish before they leave to go watch ""SportsCenter."" (LAUGHTER) I'm joined by fellow Virginians to share a Republican perspective on how to best address the challenges facing our nation today. We were encouraged to hear President Obama speak this evening about the need to create jobs. All Americans should have the opportunity to find and keep meaningful work, and the dignity that comes with it. (APPLAUSE) Many -- many of us here tonight -- and many of you watching -- have family or friends who have lost their jobs. In fact, 1 in 10 Americans is unemployed. That is unacceptable. Here in Virginia, we've faced our highest unemployment rate in more than 25 years, and bringing new jobs and more opportunities to our citizens is the top priority of my administration. Good government policy should spur economic growth and strengthen the private sector's ability to create new jobs. (APPLAUSE) We must enact policies that promote entrepreneurship and innovation so America can better compete with the world. What government should not do is pile on more taxation, regulation and litigation that kill jobs and hurt the middle class. It was Thomas Jefferson who called for ""a wise and frugal government which shall leave men free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned."" He was right. Today, the federal government is simply trying to do too much. Last year, we were told that massive new federal spending would create more jobs immediately and hold unemployment below 8 percent. In the past year, more than 3 million people have lost their jobs, and yet the Democratic Congress continues deficit spending, adding to the bureaucracy, and increasing the national debt on our children and our grandchildren. The amount of debt is on pace to double in five years and triple in 10. The federal debt is now over $100,000 per household. This is simply unsustainable. The president's partial freeze announced tonight on discretionary spending is a laudable step, but a small one. The circumstances of our time demand that we reconsider and restore the proper limited role of government at every level. (APPLAUSE) Without reform, the excessive growth of government threatens our very liberty and our prosperity. In recent months, the American people have made clear that they want government leaders to listen and then act on the issues most important to them. We want results, not rhetoric. We want cooperation, not partisanship. (APPLAUSE) There is much common ground. All Americans agree that we need health -- health care system that is affordable, accessible, and high quality. But most Americans do not want to turn over the best medical care system in the world to the federal government. Republicans in Congress have offered legislation to reform health care, without shifting Medicaid costs to the states, without cutting Medicare, and without raising your taxes. And we will do that by implementing common sense reforms, like letting families and businesses buy health insurance policies across state lines and ending frivolous lawsuits against doctors and hospitals that drive up the cost of your health care. And our solutions aren't 1,000-page bills that no one has fully read, after being crafted behind closed doors with special interests. In fact, many of our proposals are available online at solutions.gop.gov, and we welcome your ideas on Facebook and Twitter. (LAUGHTER) All Americans agree that this nation must become more energy independent and secure. We are blessed here in America with vast natural resources, and we must use them all. Advances in technology can unleash more natural gas, nuclear, wind, coal, alternative energy that will lower your utility bills. Here in Virginia, we have the opportunity to become the first state on the East Coast to explore for and produce oil and natural gas off-shore. (APPLAUSE) But this administration's policies are delaying off-shore production, hindering nuclear energy expansion, and seeking to impose job-killing cap-and-trade energy taxes. Now is the time to adopt innovative energy policies that create jobs and lower energy prices. (APPLAUSE) All Americans agree that a young person needs a world-class education to compete in the global economy. As a young kid, my dad told me, ""Son, if you want a good job, you need a good education."" Dad was right, and that's even more true today. The president and I agree on expanding the number of high-quality charter schools and rewarding teachers for excellent performance. More school choices for parents and students mean more accountability and greater achievement. A child's educational opportunity should be determined by her intellect and work ethic, not by her ZIP Code. (APPLAUSE) All Americans agree that we must maintain a strong national defense. The courage and success of our armed forces is allowing us to draw down troop levels in Iraq as that government is increasingly able to step up. My oldest daughter, Jeanine, was an Army platoon leader in Iraq, so I am personally grateful for the service and sacrifice of all our men and women in uniform, and a grateful nation thanks them. (APPLAUSE) We applaud President Obama's decision to deploy 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan. We agree that victory there is imperative for national security. But we have serious concerns over the recent steps the administration has taken regarding suspected terrorists. Americans were shocked on Christmas Day to learn of the attempted bombing of a flight to Detroit. This foreign terror suspect was given the same legal rights as a U.S. citizen and immediately stopped providing critical intelligence. As Sen.-elect Scott Brown has said, we should be spending taxpayer dollars to defeat terrorists, not to protect them. (APPLAUSE) Here at home, government must help foster a society in which all our people can use their God-given talents and liberty to pursue the great American dream. Republicans know that government cannot guarantee individual outcomes, but we strongly believe that it must guarantee equality of opportunity for all. That opportunity exists best in a democracy which promotes free enterprise, economic growth, strong families, and individual achievement. Many Americans are concerned about this administration's effort to exert greater control over car companies, banks, energy, and health care, but over-regulating employers won't create more employment, overtaxing investors won't foster more investment. Top-down, one-size-fits-all decision-making should not replace the personal choices of free people in a free market, nor undermine the proper role of state and local governments in our system of federalism. As our founders clearly stated, and we governors clearly understand, government closest to the people governs best. (APPLAUSE) And no government program can ever replace the actions of caring Americans freely choosing to help one another. The scriptures say, ""To whom much is given, much will be required."" As the most generous and prosperous nation on Earth, it is heartwarming to see Americans giving much time and money to the people of Haiti. Thank you for your ongoing compassion. (APPLAUSE) Some people say they're afraid that America is no longer the great land of promise that she has always been. They should not be. America will always blaze the trail of opportunity and prosperity. America will -- must always be a land where liberty and property are valued and respected and innocent human life is protected. Government should have this clear goal: Where opportunity is absent, we must create it. Where opportunity is limited, we must expand it. Where opportunity is unequal, we must make it open to everyone. (APPLAUSE) Our founders pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor to create this great nation. Now we should pledge as Democrats, Republicans and independents -- Americans all -- to work together to leave this nation an ever better place than we found it. God bless you, and God bless this great land of America. Thank you very much.","Gov. Bob McDonnell of Virginia responds to State of the Union speech .

"(CNN) -- A slightly higher number of Americans will travel Thanksgiving holiday weekend compared with last year, but those traveling by air is expected to decline, AAA said. The association, which surveyed 1,350 American households, projects that 38.4 million Americans will travel over the holiday weekend, up from 37.8 million last year. However, the number traveling by air is expected to decline to 2.3 million, the automobile association said. In 2008, 2.5 million Americans traveled by plane for Thanksgiving. ""We do this every year,"" said Mindy Potter of Atlanta, Georgia, who was flying with her husband and 6-year-old son. ""It's insanity every year."" Potter said she and her family were headed Wednesday to Hot Springs Village, Arkansas, to see her husband's family. See the FAA's flight delays map . She said they were allowing themselves plenty of time at the airport. ""My husband's a stickler for going early,"" she said. ""If I was in charge of it, we'd probably have a frenzied rush."" AAA said the slight increase in the number of Thanksgiving travelers from last year reflects improved consumer confidence as well as ""a growing sense among many consumers that the worst of the global economic crisis is behind us."" Travelers are still concerned about the economy, said AAA spokesman Geoff Sundstrom, and the numbers remain well down from two years ago. ""Clearly, there was a huge drop-off in the number of people traveling last year,"" he said. According to the association, Thanksgiving travel dropped 25.2 percent last year, compared with 2007. Still, Sundstrom added, ""We are encouraged that the numbers have stabilized and turning up from what they were a year ago."" The bulk of Thanksgiving travelers -- about 33.2 million -- will be traveling by car, AAA said. Jennifer Burrell of Tucker, Georgia, said she, her husband and their two daughters were driving Thursday morning to the Asheville, North Carolina, area, and will return Sunday. She said she wasn't expecting traffic on the way there but ""it always gets heavy"" on the return trip. In addition to those traveling by car, some 2.9 million will travel by train, watercraft, bus or a combination of transportation modes, and 2.3 million will travel by air, the automobile association predicted. Citing excess baggage fees and surcharges for jet fuel, along with delays and flight groundings, Sundstrom said that it's ""not a very friendly environment this decade for the airline industry or the airline traveler."" As in earlier years, the Federal Aviation Administration said military airspace will be opened to commercial flights along the East and West coasts and in the Southwest in an attempt to alleviate congestion. The airspace will be opened from Tuesday to Monday, spokesman Paul Takemoto said. As of Tuesday afternoon, the FAA Web site was reporting slight delays because of ""weather/wind"" at New York's LaGuardia Airport. Of course, some Americans are not traveling at all. Heather McKinnon of Broomfield, Colorado, said she is staying home with family for Thanksgiving. ""I don't like to fly and really rarely like flying on holidays,"" she said, adding that she would consider driving. ""I know what it's like going through the airport,"" she said. Plus, she added, ""Everything I love is here.""","AAA attributes slight increase to improved consumer confidence .

"Tottenham Hotspur humiliated Wigan 9-1 with England striker Jermain Defoe scoring five to move into the Champions League spots in the English Premier League. The incredible rout sees them draw level on points with North London rivals Arsenal and into fourth place ahead of Aston Villa, who they visit next weekend. Defoe's five equaled a Premier League record and, along with Manchester United's 9-0 thrashing of Ipswich Town in the 1994/95 season, it is the most goals scored by a Premier League side in a single game. The highest tally recorded by a team in English football league history is 13. Fellow England striker Peter Crouch scored the only goal in the first half before the floodgates opened, Defoe grabbing his first two before Wigan's Paul Scharner replied with what looked a handball. Defoe completed his hat-trick only a minute later on the 58th before Aaron Lennon made it 5-1, with Defoe then adding his fourth. A final blitz from Tottenham gave Defoe his fifth, with David Bentley's deflected effort off Chris Kirkland and Niko Kranjcar completing the rout with double figures looking on the cards when the referee ended the misery for the visitors. Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp said Defoe, who was returning after a suspension, was a ""fantastic talent"" and paid tribute to his side's eight-goal salvo after the break. ""We came out in the second half fantastic, pressed them worked them and took the opportunities,"" he told Sky Sports News. In other English Premier League action on Sunday, Blackburn Rovers beat Bolton Wanderers 2-0 away to climb up to 11th in the table. Without manager Sam Allardyce who is to undergo a heart operation, Blackburn went in front through a David Dunn curled effort before a mix-up with his goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen saw Bolton's Sam Ricketts head into his own net. In the late kickoff, Portmouth stayed bottom after losing 1-0 at Stoke, who grabbed a 74th minute winner through Ricardo Fuller after great work by winger Matthew Etherington. Pompey, who lost England goalkeeper David James to injury in the warm up, missed an eighth-minute penalty through Kevin-Prince Boateng and had chances to secure at least a point at the Britannia Stadium.","Tottenham Hotspur beat Wigan Athletic 9-1 to go back into the Champions League places .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama mentioned an $8 billion investment in high-speed train systems across the country in his State of the Union speech on Wednesday. Details released Thursday said the investment would be grants from the government's $862 billion economic stimulus package to begin the planning and initial work on creating the first nationwide program of high-speed intercity passenger rail service. Overall, projects and planning involving the rail corridors will take place in 31 states, according to a White House statement. Obama and Vice President Joe Biden were scheduled to travel to Tampa, Florida, Thursday to formally announce the program. Other Cabinet members and administration officials also were visiting sites of the program in other states on Thursday and Friday. According to the statement, the corridor between Tampa and Orlando, Florida, would have trains capable of traveling up to 168 mph with 16 round trips a day. The time to travel by train between the cities would be about an hour, compared with about 90 minutes by car, it said. ""This project will create jobs and generate economic activity as 84 miles of track are constructed, stations are built or enhanced, and equipment is purchased,"" with work expected to be completed in 2014, the statement said. ""The projects announced today are part of President Obama's strategic long-term plan to transform travel in America by building and sustaining a comprehensive passenger rail program,"" the statement said. ""In addition to the $8 billion awarded today, the plan also included $1 billion a year for five years in the federal budget as a down payment to jump-start the program."" The statement described the program as ""a long-term venture in which states will need to plan projects, purchase and lay track, build and assemble equipment, and construct or upgrade train stations, tunnels and bridges."" ""Spain spent two decades and $35 billion developing its high-speed rail system,"" it said. ""South Korea took 12 years and more than $10 billion to build a line stretching from Seoul to Busan, comparable to the distance between Boston and New York.""

"(CNN) -- News that U.S. President Barack Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize has been as polarizing as his embattled healthcare reform plans. After Obama's win, Spanish newspaper El Pais published a cartoon showing the president as a black peace dove.

"Washington (CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama met Monday night with his national security team on Afghanistan and Pakistan, the White House announced. It was the ninth meeting of the president's war council to consider whether to send more troops to Afghanistan, as requested by the U.S. commander on the ground there. The White House made no statement after the meeting ended at 10 p.m. ET (0300 GMT). The meeting included Vice President Joe Biden, Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Michael Mullen, Afghanistan commanding Gen. Stanley McChrystal, U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan Karl Eikenberry and other senior officials, the White House said earlier. At the last war council meeting -- on November 11, Veteran's Day -- Obama pushed for revisions in proposed plans for troop increases to clarify how and when U.S. troops would turn over responsibility to the Afghan government. Obama would seek answers to the questions he posed on November 11 about ""not just how we get people there, but what's the strategy for getting them out,"" White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said before the meeting. No matter what happened at the meeting, Gibbs said, Obama will not announce a decision on troop deployment until at least next week. One option calls for sending about 34,000 more U.S. troops to Afghanistan in addition to the 68,000 already committed to the country, with other options involving variations of that plan, sources told CNN. Before the November 11 meeting, Gen. David Petraeus, the top U.S. military commander in the Middle East, told CNN that the decision-making process was approaching completion. Petraeus emphasized the need to focus on the mission of ensuring that Afghanistan ""does not once again become a sanctuary or safe haven for al Qaeda and the kind of transnational extremists that carried out the 9/11 attacks."" The Obama administration has expressed concerns about Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai's viability and has ratcheted up pressure to end corruption in order to combat an intensifying Taliban insurgency. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, on a trip to Afghanistan last week to attend Karzai's inauguration after his recent re-election, reiterated the U.S. concerns in a dinner meeting with Karzai and encouraged him to seize the ""clear window of opportunity"" before him at a ""critical moment"" in Afghanistan's history. The United States and other countries are increasing their civilian presence in Afghanistan to bolster efforts to stabilize the country, the the U.S. special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard Holbrooke, told reporters on Monday. Asked about the corruption problem, Holbrooke noted that some Afghan government ministers have ""extraordinary records"" of accomplishment. The United States will work with those ministers, while recognizing that years of civil war and social woes have weakened overall leadership capabilities in Afghanistan, he said. ""This is one of the main reasons we're increasing our civilian role,"" Holbrooke said. ""And it's extremely delicate to get the mix right. We want to help the Afghans help themselves. We do not want to replace a sovereign government with internationals."" Republican opponents are pushing Obama to quickly agree to McChrystal's reported request for up to 40,000 additional troops in Afghanistan as part of a counterinsurgency strategy. ""This won't be perfect or easy, but it will allow America's fighting men and women to leave Afghanistan with honor, and it will enable Afghans to build a better, more peaceful future,"" said a letter to Obama from 10 Republican senators sent on Veteran's Day.","NEW: White House makes no statement after meeting ended .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN)  -- After 2,000 years of Christian prayer, many faithful still don't know how to pray effectively, pastor Daniel Henderson says. ""Most Christians pray out of crisis or pray a grocery list,"" he said, making ""God a lifeline of last resort."" Henderson teaches that prayer should be about worshipping God, having a one-to-one relationship through prayer. ""Every believer wants to be intimate with God and experience his power in a personal way,"" he said. ""Many are hungry to be more effective, because they haven't been taught."" Teaching is what sends Henderson across the country. He's on ""The Creative Prayer Tour,"" a series of workshops that will have stopped in 14 cities by year's end. Henderson also is an author and head of a group called Strategic Renewal, based in Forest, Virginia, which aims to strengthen churches through worship-based prayer. The prayer workshop was life-changing, said pastor Jeremy Johnson of Arcade Church in Sacramento, California. Johnson said the training helped turn him from an angry recovering alcoholic to a spiritual life pastor. ""It changed my perspective on prayer from being ask, ask, ask to building a relationship with God,"" Johnson said. ""It went from God being a vending machine to actually having a relationship with him, acknowledging who he is as opposed to what he does."" Such is the demand for the prayer summits that Henderson speaks at 20 to 30 churches and to as many as 13,000 college students annually, he said. Even pillars of the Christian faith struggle with prayer. ""As for me, the silence and the emptiness is so great that I look and do not see, listen and do not hear,"" Mother Teresa told the Rev. Michael Van Der Peet in 1979, expressing her concern about decades seemingly going by without her prayers being answered. Henderson cites The Lord's Prayer in the sixth chapter of the book of Matthew as the blueprint for Christians, containing what could be called the four Rs of prayer. He breaks down the passage this way from the New Living Translation of the Bible: . Reverence -- ""Pray like this: Our Father in heaven, may your name be kept holy."" Response -- ""May your will be done on Earth, as it is in heaven."" Requests -- ""Give us today the food we need, and forgive us our sins, as we have forgiven those who sin against us."" Readiness -- ""And don't let us yield to temptation, but rescue us from the evil one."" The Lord's Prayer is a simple invocation that is recited weekly at many Christian churches and comes from Jesus' Sermon on the Mount, a compilation of his teachings. ""It's OK to use a set formula/pattern,"" according Cyndi McDonald, an associate minister at First United Methodist Church in Marietta, Georgia. ""The disciples asked Jesus how to pray, and he gave The Lord's Prayer."" No matter how people pray, it's a part of American life, according to a recent poll by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life. The study shows that 75 percent of Americans of all faiths -- including Christians, Jews and Muslims -- report praying at least once a week, while 39 percent attend services weekly. McDonald said the numbers could use some interpreting. ""What do they mean by pray? A quick blessing over a meal? An hour spent in solitude?"" she asks. For Henderson, the prayer statistics point to a yearning for God. ""The hunger is there for a personal faith. It indicates a spiritual hunger that won't be satisfied,"" he said. ""It's a personal thing and very real beyond the walls of church.""","Pastor Daniel Henderson: ""Most Christians pray out of crisis or pray a grocery list""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Dalai Lama, accepting a human rights prize from a U.S. foundation Tuesday, chastised the United States for not fully addressing the economic divide between its poorest and richest citizens. The Dalai Lama sits with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi at the awards ceremony on Tuesday. ""Huge gap, rich to poor. This is unhealthy,"" he said. ""You have to think seriously about those less-privileged people. They're also human beings."" The ""real greatness of America,"" he said, ""is your ancestors' principles,"" and he urged the nation to preserve those principles. ""When I think of America, I think of the idea -- concept of freedom, liberty, equality. I think these are real human values,"" he said. The inaugural Lantos Human Rights Prize, presented to the 74-year-old Dalai Lama by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, honors his commitment to ending global injustice. The Dalai Lama called the award, from the New Hampshire-based Lantos Foundation for Human Rights and Justice, ""a great privilege, especially because it is named after an individual I admired deeply."" He was referring to the late Rep. Tom Lantos, D-California, whom the foundation describes as a champion of human rights during his 27 years in Congress. Lantos, who was the only Holocaust survivor in Congress, died of cancer in February 2008. His image is on the large medal. Before presenting the award, Pelosi said people continue to be inspired by the Dalai Lama's messages of peace and nonviolence. The medal, the California Democrat said, contains the words ""The rights of one are the rights of all."" ""The Dalai Lama is one of the most highly honored peacemakers of our time,"" she added. Tuesday's program focused largely on the work of Lantos, who co-founded the Congressional Human Rights Caucus about 20 years ago. The name of the caucus has been changed to the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, and part of its mission is to ""promote, defend and advocate internationally recognized human rights norms in a nonpartisan manner,"" according to its Web site. The group is a formal entity of Congress, said Howard Berman, D-California, who was at Tuesday's event. Also at the ceremony was Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, who called Lantos ""an inspiration."" ""When he died we lost one of the better angels of our national conscience,"" McCain said. According to the foundation, created by Lantos' daughter, Katrina Lantos Swett, the Lantos Prize is meant to focus attention on the ""often unsung heroes of the human rights movement."" The foundation's Web site says the prize ""will be awarded on an annual basis to the individual or organization that best exemplifies the foundation's mission, namely, to be a vital voice standing up for the values of decency, dignity, freedom and justice in every corner of the world."" The Dalai Lama is visiting Washington this week for a conference and to meet with Undersecretary for Global Affairs Maria Otero, who has just been named as President Obama's special coordinator on Tibet, State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said Monday. The Dalai Lama won't meet with Obama, who instead plans to visit with him after a presidential trip next month to China, Kelly said. The Dalai Lama and Tibet are dicey issues in Washington, since Beijing considers the Himalayan province a part of China and accuses the spiritual leader of advocating Tibetan independence. The Dalai Lama -- whose name is Tenzin Gyatso -- has repeatedly said he seeks autonomy for the region, not independence, and advocates the ""middle way"" of nonviolence. China has ruled Tibet since 1951, a year after sending troops to ""liberate"" the region from what it said was serfdom under the Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama's emissaries have held sporadic talks with Chinese officials. But the talks, encouraged by the United States and other countries, have failed to break the impasse. In a 2007 trip to Washington, the Dalai Lama met with then-President George W. Bush, who awarded him the Congressional Gold Medal, the nation's highest civilian honor. Asked whether the lack of a meeting between the Dalai Lama and Obama represents a change in U.S. policy toward China or Tibet, Kelly said, ""I wouldn't necessarily read ... anything into the decision beyond what it is."" ""Our position regarding China is clear, that we want to engage China. We think China is an important global player. We also don't try and downplay some of the concerns that we have about China ... in the areas of human rights, religious freedom, and freedom of expression."" The Dalai Lama won a Nobel Prize for advocating peace, but he has not been allowed to return to Tibet since fleeing his homeland in 1959. On Thursday and Friday, he is scheduled to participate in a conference called ""Educating World Citizens for the 21st Century."" On Saturday he is to spend the morning teaching on ""The Heart of Change: Finding Wisdom in the Modern World,"" an event organized by the Conservancy for Tibetan Art and Culture. He then is slated to return to India before traveling to Japan, Australia and New Zealand.","NEW: Dalai Lama lauds U.S. founding principles, decries gap between rich and poor .

"London, England (CNN) -- The governing body of world football, FIFA, has turned down the request from the Irish Football Association (FAI) to replay their deciding World Cup play-off game against France. The controversial match, that was played on Wednesday, has caused a diplomatic storm after French forward Thierry Henry admitted to illegally using his hand to set-up the goal that gave his team a 2-1 aggregate victory to seal qualification to the tournament. But despite a letter sent to FIFA by the FAI, and calls from both the Irish prime minister Brian Cowen and Irish justice minister Dermot Ahern for the game to be replayed, the sport's organizing body has refused the request. In a statement on their official Web site FIFA stated:  ""The result of the match cannot be changed and the match cannot be replayed. As is clearly mentioned in the Laws of the Game, during matches, decisions are taken by the referee and these decisions are final."" Irish football officials lodged an official complaint with FIFA on Thursday and sent a letter to the French Football Federation (FFF) in a bid to get the game reconvened. The world's worst football injustices . ""The governing body of world football have to step up to the plate and accede to our call for a replay,"" FAI chief executive John Delaney told reporters. The FAI pointed to a precedent set in 2005 when a World Cup qualifier between  Uzbekistan and Bahrain was replayed after the referee was found to have committed a technical error in the application of the laws of the game. But a FIFA spokesman said the precedent did not apply because the referee in the match ""saw the incident in question and simply failed to apply the proper rules"". Irish prime minister Cowen raised the issue with French president Nicolas Sarkozy at a European Union (EU) summit in Brussels, where the two leaders were meeting to vote for the next president of Europe. Cowen told the Irish Independent newspaper: ""I didn't ask for a replay. I said, you know: 'What do you think?' and he said: 'Look, I understand totally the sense of disappointment that you feel about the game. I'm not trying to mix politics and sport in this respect. We just had a chat. [But] it's not going to be resolved by he and I."" Mr Sarkozy, however, said he did not want to get involved: ""I said to Brian Cowen, who is a friend of mine as you know, that I was sorry for them and how I was struck by the talent and vigor of the Irish team. ""Now do not ask me to stand in for the referee of the game or the football decision -- be they in France or in Europe,"" he said. ""What will be done will be done. But leave me out of it, please. And to be perfectly frank with you that is the sort of answer I want to give,"" he added. Despite Sarkozy's comments, French finance minister Christine Lagarde said she supported moves for a replay. ""I think it's very sad. I'm of course very happy that the French team will play in the World Cup, but I find it very sad that it did qualify with... you know... an act of cheating,"" she told RTL radio station. The game between France and Ireland was one of six play offs played on Wednesday which decided the final 32 teams heading South Africa in 2010. Video replays showed Henry used his hand to stop the ball going out of play in extra-time, before he passed to William Gallas who booked his nation's place with a headed goal. The draw for next year's finals is due to be made in Cape Town on December 4.","FIFA turn down a request from the Irish Football Association (FAI) to replay their deciding World Cup play-off game against France .

"(CNN) -- Uga VII, the University of Georgia mascot whose deeply furrowed face was a fixture at the school for more than a year, died early Thursday, the university said. He was 4 years old. The purebred English bulldog died of heart-related causes in Savannah, Georgia, according to its owner, Frank ""Sonny"" Seiler. Fans knew Uga VII had arrived when the white dog, sporting a spiked collar and red Georgia University jersey, made his short strides along the football field's sidelines. He made his first appearance at the August 30, 2008, season opener, when Georgia faced off against Georgia Southern, the university said. He was nearing the end of his second season with the team, the university said. He was preceded by his father, Uga VI, the university's winningest mascot, who died of congestive heart failure. ""This is a very sad day for the Seiler family but also for all Georgia people,"" said Damon Evans, University of Georgia director of athletics in a university news release. ""Just as his ancestors, he had captured the hearts of college football fans everywhere as the country's No. 1 mascot. He had been truly embraced by all those who follow the Georgia Bulldogs across the country. We will miss him dearly."" Uga VII's given name was Loran's Best, the university said. His death was unexpected. ""We are all in a state of shock,"" Seiler said in the release. ""We had no warning whatsoever."" A wreath will be placed on Uga VII's doghouse on the sideline, the university said. There won't be a live mascot to take his place at Saturday's game against Kentucky. Officials have not decided who will replace the white bulldog, but the decision is expected next year, Seiler said. Until then, fans and Seiler will mourn the loss of the school's favorite pooch. ""He was 10-3 last year, which is not bad for a freshman,"" Seiler said. ""Uga VII was not as active or mischievous as his father but more distinguished. He realized his role when he put his shirt on. He was well-behaved and always appreciated the significance of his role.""","Uga VII was in his second season as University of Georgia mascot .

"Editor's note: Akbar Ganji is a leading Iranian dissident and pro-democracy activist. He served a six-year sentence in Tehran's Evin prison for his reporting on human rights abuses in Iran. The London-based human rights organization, Article 19, has described Ganji as the ""Iranian Vaclav Havel"" and he has received more than a dozen human rights, press freedom and pro-democracy awards. He is the author of ""The Road to Democracy in Iran"" (MIT Press, 2008). Akbar Ganji says Iran's leaders should be held to account for denying its citizens their liberties. (CNN) -- This week world leaders will gather in New York for the annual meeting of the U.N. General Assembly. While Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad will be among them, Iranians reject his claim to leadership. They strongly oppose any meeting or recognition of Ahmadinejad, especially by President Obama. The pro-democracy movement in Iran today unanimously believes that he enjoys his current position because he was ""reappointed"" president after stealing several million votes in June 12 presidential election. Popular protests against this state of affairs have been met with bullets from the Iranian regime. Thousands were arrested and dozens were killed. Opposition supporters have been tortured in jail and credible reports of rape have surfaced. In recent years the Western media has not focused on the systematic human rights violations in Iran but rather on Iran's nuclear ambitions and Ahmadinejad's rhetoric toward Israel and the Nazi Holocaust. Iranians are deeply upset by the general inattentiveness of the media and world leaders to their political protests. If you listen to the democratic voices of Iranians and leaders of Iran's Green Movement there is a unanimous view that Ahmadinejad's policies have severely undermined Iranian national interests and he has inadvertently better served the interests of Israel. Although the regime has been able to reassert control due to severe repression recent events have led to important social transformations in Iran. Today there are many prominent names publicly opposing the Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei. Many open letters have been circulated that for the first time directly criticize him. U.S. policy under Obama has also played a constructive role. The absence of military threats and new economic sanctions has given democracy activists more room to maneuver, posing new challenges to the regime. In order to deal with this internal crisis Khamenei's only option is to shift attention to Iran's relationship with the outside world -- the United States in particular. By increasing verbal attacks on the West and exacerbating regional conflicts he hopes to draw the attention of both Iranians and the world away from the systematic violations of human rights in Iran. Iran's nuclear ambitions should not be considered the primary weak point for the regime. To a limited extent Khamenei and his disciples can manipulate the nationalist sentiment of Iranians around this issue. The Achilles heel for the regime today is the widespread and systematic violations of human rights against it own people. Greater exposure and scrutiny of this key issue will generate more popular discontent toward the leaders of Iran. Khamenei cannot maintain regime loyalty or acquiescence in the face of these massive human rights violations. It is precisely these organized repressive measures that the International Criminal Court, in other contexts, has called ""crimes against humanity."" Although Iran, like the United States and Israel, are not members of the ICC, charges can be brought against the Iranian regime via the U.N. Security Council -- similar to the process that led to the arrest warrant for Omar Al Bashir, the leader of Sudan. We in the Iranian human rights movement can document, with certification from a team of international lawyers, that leaders of the Iranian regime are guilty of crimes against humanity under Article 7 of the Rome Statute that established the ICC. Today, the people of Iran are in need of the moral and spiritual support from people around the world. In the current circumstances the most important form of support would be to assist with the campaign of charging the leaders of Iran with ""crimes against humanity"" and to help disseminate this initiative so that it becomes the main avenue of engagement with Iran by the international community. We are seeking to place this issue at the top of the international agenda so that leaders of the Iranian regime will think twice before traveling abroad as well as to make it morally unacceptable for leaders of democratic countries to extend a hand to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

"FREDERICKSBURG, Virginia (CNN) -- Shin Fujiyama's life has been highlighted by second chances. Shin Fujiyama's organization, Students Helping Honduras, has raised more than $750,000. Born in a fishing village in Japan, Fujiyama, 25, recalls a childhood dominated by health concerns. Doctors told his parents that he had a hole in his heart and ""they didn't think I had lot longer to live."" But during a later visit to the doctor, Fujiyama says, his family learned the hole had closed. ""Somehow I was cured and I became a normal kid,"" Fujiyama says. ""And I had a second chance."" During his sophomore year at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, he volunteered in Honduras with a campus group and was struck by the extreme poverty he saw -- barefoot children collecting cans and sleeping in the streets. Fujiyama says he realized he could help give other children their own second chance. Today, his organization, Students Helping Honduras, brings education and community projects to children and families in need through student service trips and fundraisers. Do you know someone who should be a CNN Hero? Nominations are open at CNN.com/Heroes . ""Seeing the country and being able to make a difference really opened my eyes to a lot of things,"" he says. ""I saw such a great need. I wanted to keep helping."" He started by telling his friends about his experience and collecting spare change at his two campus jobs, but Fujiyama found that organizing other students didn't happen so easily. ""When I had my very first meeting, I got all dressed up. And only two people showed up,"" he says. ""I knew I had to keep fighting."" He enlisted his younger sister, Cosmo, then a student at the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, to the cause. ""She's dynamite,"" he says. ""When she talks in front of a crowd, she can move mountains. Knowing that she was behind it, I knew I could do anything."" Since 2006, the siblings' grass-roots campaign to help Honduras has grown to 25 campuses and raised more than $750,000 to fund projects, including the construction of two schools and the establishment of scholarships to help young women attend college. Fujiyama says students are deeply committed to the organization because they are involved on every level: They raise money and then travel to Honduras to help build houses. ""We make friends with all the kids, all the families -- no matter where we're from. We've had people from all over the world come to Honduras with us. And it's a great network we've made,"" he says.  Watch Fujiyama and his group in action » . While Fujiyama spends his summers in Honduras working alongside volunteers, he spends a large portion of the year on the road visiting colleges to organize chapters and raise funds. Cosmo Fujiyama, 23, lives in Honduras full time to coordinate the group's building efforts on the ground. Students Helping Honduras is working with community members of Siete de Abril to build a new village. Many of the families lost their belongings to Hurricane Mitch in 1998. ""A lot of them are single mothers. They don't own the land. They all live in cardboard houses. They don't have access to clean water [or] health care, and they didn't have a school,"" Shin Fujiyama says. Fujiyama's group helped villagers purchase a new plot of land to rebuild. Its members have helped build 44 homes in the village that has been newly named Villa Soleada (""Sunshine Village""). The organization also is raising funds to build a water tower, an eco-friendly sanitation system and a library and to help provide electricity.  Watch Fujiyama describe how the village came to be » . For Fujiyama, who deferred medical school to dedicate himself to his mission in Honduras, the lifestyle is a far cry from private practice, but he says he loves what he is doing.  Watch Fujiyama describe how a second chance and a trip to Honduras changed his life » . ""I feel like we're making a huge impact. Some people might think that you have to be somebody famous or a millionaire or a doctor to do something,"" he says. ""But we're just everyday students -- people in their 20s. We can do so much. We've got so many things going for us. ... It's just about leveraging what we have. And we have done a great job at that."" Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- Grace, Kara and Trichelle were created to fill a void for young black girls who for so long have been playing with dolls that don't look like them. Stacy McBride-Irby, creator of the new Barbie, poses with the dolls. The new black Barbies released by Mattel have fuller lips, curlier hair and other features that the company says more accurately represent African-American women. Some have cheered the new dolls. Others jeered them, saying they're not black enough. ""I love the black Barbie. It's about time,"" Jua Simpson said on CNN's iReport, a user-generated news community. ""But the hair is still a step backwards, since most of our hair is not straight and light brown."" Others disagree with critics who say the dolls should have had more natural black hairstyles, such as afros or braids. ""Many people have criticized the dolls for either having hair that's too long or too straight, but I have long, straight hair that I straightened. But it's my hair and a part of me,"" said Tanisa Zoe Samuel, an African-American iReporter from the Turks and Caicos, in the Caribbean. ""Black women come in all shades, shapes and varieties that there is just no way to capture everyone with three dolls."" iReport.com: Samuel shares her thoughts on the new Barbie . The dolls were created by Stacy McBride-Irby, an African-American who watched her daughter play with dolls and wanted to create a doll that looked more like her. McBride-Irby said she has heard the criticism, but she also has received many kudos. ""They mean so much to me because they did come from a positive place,"" McBride-Irby said. ""My daughter loves the dolls. I've had dads thank me for creating this line of dolls that represent their little girls. These dolls are for girls all over the world."" This is not the first time Mattel has released an ethnic doll that drew criticism.  See photos of the black Barbie dolls » . In 1997, Mattel collaborated with cookie maker Nabisco to create Oreo Fun Barbie. The black version of the doll, which sported an Oreo-shaped purse, was criticized by some who noted that ""Oreo"" is a derogatory term in the black community. The word is used to describe someone who is perceived as black on the outside and white on the inside. For some, the talk about dolls is not just child's play. Some think early play with dolls can affect a girl's self-esteem later in life. Actress Nia Long, who appears in comedian Chris Rock's new documentary, ""Good Hair,"" recently talked about the issue on CNN. ""Historically, the Afrocentric features have not been celebrated,"" Long said.

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- An American soldier in Iraq has been sentenced to two years in military prison on child pornography charges, the U.S. military said Tuesday. At a general court-martial Monday at Baghdad's Camp Victory, Army Pvt. James R. Bickerstaff pleaded guilty to attempted possession of child pornography and communicating indecent language to a child under 16. Bickerstaff also received a bad-conduct discharge. The soldier was stationed at Fort Riley, Kansas, in August 2006 when he ""engaged in a discussion with a 12-year-old girl in an attempt to initiate physical contact of a sexual nature,"" the military said. In April and May, he downloaded pornographic videos to a personal laptop and an iPod and attempted to download child pornography, the military said.

"(CNN) -- The alleged gang rape of a 15-year-old girl on the campus of Richmond High School in Northern California while 10 or more witnesses, most of them students, looked on has sparked familiar questions: ""Why are our kids so messed up?"" ""Why didn't these students try to stop the crime?"" ""What's happening in our schools?"" These are fair questions, and commentators in the media have provided familiar answers. The purported rape is another sad example of today's self-absorbed and uncaring youth. It was the media's glorification of violence that caused it. The horrific act shows how sociopathic brains develop. But it seems as if the majority of commentators have settled on the idea that the Richmond students did nothing because of the ""bystander effect"": The more people involved in a criminal incident, the less likely any one of them will intervene to do something about it. Unfortunately, this ""What's wrong with our children?"" approach leads to a dead end, because it results in a sweeping moral condemnation of the schools, families and students in this community. These perpetrators committed a heinous act that should be widely condemned. But a discussion that focuses exclusively on the immorality of these deviant young men does not provide solutions that prevent gang rape from happening. Talking only about the bystander effect wrongly suggests that the vast majority of teens would not call for help. Take Richmond. Claims of depraved acts by a few kids have served to demonize an entire student community. Rather than demonize all teenagers in Richmond High School, we should be asking another question: ""What can we do to prevent such heinous acts from happening?"" The answer to that question leads to a wholly different kind of dialogue, one that may surprise. It is primarily students, the reputed problem, who can best prevent acts of violence on campus. Make no mistake about it. The alleged two-hour-long gang rape on October 24 was an extreme form of school violence. It unfolded not far from the gym where the school-sponsored homecoming dance, supervised by school staff and police officers, was being held. And students, police say, largely perpetrated it. Research since the massacres at Columbine High School (1999) and Virginia Tech (2007) has taught us a lot about how to prevent such school violence. Chief among them is that school staff and security should patrol campuses, especially violence-prone areas, during and after school events. According to a CNN report, a friend of the alleged victim saw blatant failures in safety precautions. She said, ""I looked outside of the gym, and I saw 12 to 15 guys, sitting there, with no IDs. The officers -- not only did they not check the IDs of those students or men sitting outside of of our campus, but the security officers who are employed here did no job of checking either."" Virtually all students and teachers at a school can identify these dangerous hot spots. At Richmond High School, one such spot is ""a dark alley near the back side of the school,"" the site of the purported rape. As CNN reported, school officials had even requested that video cameras and more lights be installed in the area, but they were never installed. The alleged rapists and student bystanders probably knew that no one would be patrolling the area. As important as campus patrols are in reducing campus violence, the most powerful form of prevention is believing that students can help stop crime from happening. They didn't stop the purported rape at Richmond, a skeptic might say. A possible reason is that they were not educated on how to stop it. . Research shows us that students often know ahead of time when and where violence will flare up on campus. Strong social networks and the widespread use of cell phones and text messaging rapidly convey such information. This dynamic can fuel violence, as officials say it did at Richmond High School. It can also prevent violence. Thousands of potential school crimes, including violent ones, have been averted on campuses across the country because students alerted school officials before the crime occurred. Students and families using a hot line in Colorado were credited with preventing more than 206 incidents of school violence from 2004-06. As of summer 2009, this one hot line fielded 1,687 reports that resulted in crime prevention or intervention. Alert students have also helped prevent replays of the tragedies that occurred at Columbine and Virginia Tech by tipping off school officials. Several years ago, student reports stopped a Columbine-style massacre plot, employing bombs, napalm and automatic weapons, at a high school in Green Bay, Wisconsin. This year, tips from students and alert teachers and police disrupted a student-massacre plot, featuring pipe bombs and firearms, at Hillside High School in San Mateo, California. Since Columbine, school shootings have been averted in New Bedford, New York, and Covina, California, to name some others. And at Richmond, it was an 18-year-old bystander, overhearing others talking about the incident, who reported the crime. Unfortunately, the public is largely unaware of these frequently heroic acts by high school students and their teachers because they don't often get national media attention. That lack of information has helped obscure the important roles that students and their responsive teachers play in preventing school violence. But the evidence is clear. Students who know what to do when they witness school violence, or when they have a strong sense of impending violence, will become anonymous heroes. But they need to be taught what to do, which phone numbers -- including hot lines -- to call and which school officials or police department can be trusted to act on their reports. Students also need to feel confident that they can report trouble without fear of retribution from their peers or being called a snitch. It is up to the teachers and administrators who run schools to teach their students these procedures. They need to convince students that they will listen and respond consistently to their reports of violence or possible violence. Yes, local police need to develop trusting relationships with students and the overall community, or nothing will be reported. But the job of preventing violence on campus belongs primarily, if not solely, to the schools. Rather than wring our hands about the so-called immorality of today's students, we should embrace them as full partners in the prevention of violence on campus. Morality is not the issue. If students are educated on what to do when the threat of violence arises and are encouraged to follow the procedures, they can be trusted to do the right thing. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ron Astor.","Commentators focused on why students didn't report alleged rape, Astor says .

"(CNN) -- A mother's plot to blame a stranger for killing her sons went awry when one of the boys survived and told police how Michelle Kehoe cut his throat, then moved on to his younger brother, an Iowa prosecutor said Thursday. Police found the 7-year-old covered in dried blood in the family van the morning of October 27, 2008, in a secluded area near a pond east of Littleton. Beside the van, his 2-year-old brother lay dead, his throat also slashed. ""She cut me,"" the boy said in a high-pitched voice in an audio recording that was played Thursday in Kehoe's first-degree murder trial. Kehoe, of Coralville, Iowa, has pleaded not guilty to charges of first-degree murder, attempted murder and child endangerment causing serious injury. Before the trial, her lawyers filed a notice of intent to present an insanity defense, according to court records. Kehoe's lawyers chose to reserve their opening arguments for the start of their case. Dressed in a blue and white striped blouse, Kehoe frowned as she listened to her son's voice on the recording, occasionally bowing her head. The boy had locked himself in the van overnight after his mother slashed him and his younger brother the previous day and left them for dead, Assistant Iowa Attorney General Andrew Prosser said in his opening statement. Kehoe then walked to a nearby pond and attempted to kill herself by slashing her throat with the same weapon, a camouflage-handle Winchester hunting knife she bought the month before, Prosser said. When it became apparent she was not going to die, the prosecutor said, she staggered half a mile down the road to the nearest home and told a story she'd concocted weeks before of how a stranger abducted the family, killed her sons and tried to kill her. But when authorities went searching for the stranger, they instead found her 7-year-old son in the car and his younger brother dead outside the driver's side. ""Do you know where you're injured at?"" Deputy Stephen Peterson asked the boy in the recording. ""Just my throat,"" the boy said. ""Who did that to you?"" ""My mom."" The boy said his mother also put duct tape over his eyes, nose and mouth, but that he pulled them off after his mother left him. ""She was hurting my baby brother,"" he said. Kehoe began plotting the attack the month before with the purchase of the knife and the duct tape, Prosser said. She allegedly chose the date of the incident to coincide with when her husband, Gene, was scheduled to take a yoga class, telling him they were going to visit her mother at a nursing home in Sumner. Police also say they found signs of a cover-up at the scene, including pieces of a first-aid kit scattered around the scene and a handwritten note documenting the attack, Prosser said. The note detailed how a man broke into the car when the family stopped at a gas station and forced them to the area where the van was found. Kehoe tried to fight him off with pepper spray but he knocked her unconscious, the note said, according to the prosecutor. Police said Kehoe later told them she had written the note in the midst of the attack to explain what had happened to those who would find the scene, according to the prosecutor. ""And the note, which you'll see, ends with, 'Oh no, here he comes again...' "" Prosser told the jury. Kehoe faces life in prison without parole if convicted of first-degree murder for her son's death.","Michelle Kehoe slashed sons' throats, left them for dead, tried to kill herself, prosecutor says .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Just as police were starting a manhunt in the killing of four people, the suspect drove back to the crime scene in suburban Atlanta, Georgia. Richard Ringold is accused of shooting five people in the home he lived in. ""He was in the Dodge Intrepid that we told the media to look out for,"" said Gwinnett County police Cpl. Illana Spellman.

The fifth victim, a 4-year-old child, underwent surgery late Thursday, and another person escaped unharmed, Spellman said. Police were initially working on a theory that the shootings could have been related to an ongoing domestic violence issue, she said. It was believed that Ringold was dating one of the women who lived in the home, Spellman said. He was arrested on four counts of murder and one count of aggravated assault.

"(CNN) -- Life goes on for people who jump out of airplanes, even a day after two fellow parachutists died when their canopies apparently became entangled. Jumps continue at the Parachute Center, where two parachutists died Sunday. On Monday, the Parachute Center near Lodi, California, was open, just like it is any other day. The two jumpers who died Sunday had taken off from the parachute facility in central California. ""Everybody's sad. Everybody's unhappy,"" said Parachute Center owner Bill Dause. ""But everybody here is here because they enjoy jumping. Neither one of them would have wanted us to shut the doors,"" he said, referring to the jumpers who died Sunday. The San Joaquin County Sheriff's Office received a 911 call for assistance at 12:53 p.m. Sunday, said Deputy Les Garcia. The sheriff's spokesman confirmed there were two deaths, but referred questions to the Federal Aviation Administration. ""We're investigating,"" said FAA spokesman Ian Gregor, adding that two investigators were on their way to the jump center. The inquiry could take months, Gregor said. ""One of the main things we want to do is get a hold of a video that was supposedly taken,"" Gregor said. The FAA has purview over such issues as how the parachutes were packed -- by whom, when and how -- and whether weather conditions were correctly considered. ""Obviously, in a situation like this, we certainly want to look at how the parachutes were packed,"" he said. ""But it's possible that what happened is beyond our regulatory capability."" Garcia said he could not identify the two victims. ""The ID and notification of next of kin is pending,"" he said, because ""one of the victims has two names."" Parachute Center owner Dause and media reports have identified the victims as Robby Bigley and Barbara Cuddy. They were among eight parachutists from a competition team who jumped from an airplane at 9,000 feet to practice making a ""canopy-relative formation,"" a maneuver in which they stacked parachutes near each other to form a wedge, Dause said. ""The last two individuals docking experienced canopy problems,"" Dause said. One jumper's chute rotated into another jumper's canopy and they smacked into a third parachutist, Dause said. The third parachutist managed to wriggle free, Dause said, but the other two remained entangled and spiraled down from 5,000 feet. They were unable to deploy their reserve chutes. They landed in a vineyard, Dause said. One victim was dead at the scene and the other died at a local hospital, reports said. Bigley and Cuddy are listed on the United States Parachute Association Web site as national record holders for formation jumps. Bigley's record jump occurred this year and Cuddy's in 2007. The jump team was preparing for a national competition in October. According to the United States Parachute Association, there were 30 skydiving fatalities last year. No figures were available for this year. The most fatalities occurred in 1998, when 44 people died. The fewest in recent years was in 2007, with 18, according to the association. Dause said there have been previous fatalities at the Parachute Center, but he did not elaborate. ""We've been open for a long time,"" he said.","Jumpers die when parachutes tangle during a formation .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- The highly fortified International Zone in Baghdad came under fire the same day that Vice President Joe Biden paid a surprise visit, an Interior Ministry official told CNN. Vice President Joe Biden talks to the media Tuesday in Baghdad's fortified International Zone. Biden was not injured, according to CNN's Chris Lawrence, who was traveling with the vice president. But at least one round seems to have landed in the U.S. Embassy grounds, U.S. Ambassador Christopher Hill said. The zone houses the embassy and many government buildings. Lawrence said he heard the blasts but saw no damage. CNN's Cal Perry said he heard four loud ""booms."" Warning alarms were sounded, and security was stepped up in the International Zone, which is informally known as the Green Zone. It is not clear what weapons were fired or if Biden was near the location where the rounds hit. For security reasons, reporters traveling with the vice president are not allowed to report his location.  Watch as Lawrence reports on the attack » . A U.S. military spokesman said he could confirm only that one round hit, and he said it did not land in the International Zone. ""Initial reports indicate one round of indirect fire impacted near the International Zone, not in it,"" Lt. Col. Phillip Smith, a spokesman for the U.S. military in Baghdad, told CNN. But Hill told reporters that some sort of projectile landed in the east end of the embassy complex. He said the projectile was the reason for a ""duck-and-cover"" alarm that journalists traveling with Biden heard during a briefing by top U.S. officials in Baghdad. The alarm sounded intermittently throughout almost the entire 35-minute briefing by Hill and the top U.S. general in Iraq, Ray Odierno, Lawrence said. Odierno and Hill did not seem concerned, he said. No one jumped up or tried to run out of the building. They paused if they were talking when the alarm sounded, and picked up when it stopped. There was an ""all-clear"" as the briefing ended. Hill said it is kind of unusual to get this type of attack now. He said they used to happen 10 to 12 times a day, but now are few and far between. Biden's visit was widely reported on Iraqi television, Perry said. He is in Iraq to meet with the country's leaders and visit U.S. troops, his office said. Journalists on the plane with the vice president were not told where they were going until after they were on the way. Biden was due to sit down with Iraqi President Jalal Talabani and Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, as well as Massoud Barzani, the president of the Kurdistan Regional Government, and other officials. He was greeted at the airport at dusk by Gen. Odierno, Ambassador Hill and Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari.  Watch Biden arrive in Iraq, greet troops » . He flew by helicopter to the International Zone. Biden, Hill, Odierno and Deputy Secretary of State Jim Steinberg, who is traveling with Biden, then went into a meeting. They did not speak to reporters. This is Biden's third trip to Iraq this year, after visits in July and January. ""The president has asked the vice president to provide sustained, high-level focus from the White House on Iraq, and this trip is part of that mission,"" the White House said in a statement issued as Biden arrived. The United States is less than a year away from its goal of withdrawing all combat troops from Iraq. Hill has said the next 12 months are ""very critical"" to establishing security in Iraq, but the goal of withdrawing most U.S. troops by August 2010 is ""absolutely achievable."" Biden said Odierno is ""optimistic"" that Iraqi forces will be ready in time to allow U.S. withdrawals to go ahead as planned, according to Lawrence.

"(CNN) -- A Tennessee man -- accused in a fatal attack at a military recruiting center in Arkansas in June -- wants to plead guilty and claims to have ties to al Qaeda in Yemen in a letter he wrote to the judge presiding over his case. In the handwritten letter dated January 12, Abdul Hakim Muhammad said he did not want a trial and insisted the shooting was ""justified"" under jihad. ""This was a jihadi attack on infidel forces that didn't go as plan,"" he wrote. ""Flat out truth."" It was not immediately clear whether the judge, Herbert Wright Jr., would accept the plea. Muhammad's lawyer, Claiborne Ferguson, called the letter ""highly inappropriate."" ""If my client had the intention of pleading guilty, it is misguided and misinformed as to Arkansas law,"" Ferguson said from Memphis, Tennessee, on Thursday. ""He can't plead guilty to a capital crime."" That response is why Muhammad said he decided to bypass his lawyer with a letter to Wright. He wrote that he believed it was ""a lie"" that he could not plead guilty. Muhammad, formerly known as Carlos Bledsoe, is charged with killing Pvt. William Long, 23, and wounding Pvt. Quinton Ezeagwula, 18. The attack happened on June 1 at a recruiting center in Little Rock, Arkansas. In June, Muhammad pleaded not guilty to one count of capital murder and 16 counts of engaging in a terrorist act. Before pleading not guilty, Muhammad waived his Miranda rights and gave a video statement indicating political and religious motives, authorities said. He ""stated that he was a practicing Muslim ... that he was mad at the U.S. military because of what they had done to Muslims in the past,"" Detective Tommy Hudson wrote in a police report at the time. Muhammad told police ""he fired several rounds at the soldiers with the intent of killing them,"" according to Hudson's report. In his letter to the judge, Muhammad claimed he had links to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in Yemen, a group that has claimed responsibility for the attempting bombing of a U.S.-bound airliner on Christmas Day. ""My lawyer has no defense,"" he wrote. ""I wasn't insane or post traumatic nor was I forced to do this act. Which I believe and it is justified according to Islamic laws and the Islamic religion jihad -- to fight those who wage war on Islam and Muslims.""

Though details of the investigation are scant, police said they arrested Clark on Thursday and charged him with Le's murder after collecting more than 250 pieces of evidence. Clark was an honor student at Branford High School in suburban New Haven. He graduated in 2004, and according to the school's yearbook, he was a member of the Asian Awareness Club his senior year. High school friend Lisa Heselin remembers Clark ""as a jokester, kind of a class clown,"" she said. ""Everybody knew him. Everybody liked him."" She and others who knew Clark in high school are shocked that he was arrested in connection with Le's murder, she said.  Watch what acquaintances say about Clark » . ""They can't believe it, and then, of course, you're reminiscing, like, 'Oh my God, remember when we went over to his house and we all hung out?' You don't expect somebody you grew up with to be involved in something like this,"" Heselin said. Maurice Perry, who said he has been friends with Clark since first grade, told CNN on Thursday night that he doesn't believe his longtime pal is guilty. ""This is not the Raymond Clark that I know,"" he said. ""I've known him so long, I just can't picture him doing something like this."" Asked if he ever knew Clark to be violent, Perry replied, ""Not at all. I've known him to be outgoing, happy, athletic, fun. Violent, not at all."" Most of his current neighbors in Middletown, about 30 miles northeast of New Haven, said they moved in after Clark or knew him only in passing. Many said he shared the second-floor apartment with his girlfriend and a dog. Police said he drove a Ford Mustang, which was seized as evidence. Neighbor Ashley Rowe described Clark as ""decent"" and said he asked a lot of questions when he spoke to people and wanted to know their full names and where they were from. Rowe also remembered the first time she met his dog. ""His dog was very excited and he was just like, 'Oh, don't worry. He's friendly.' You could pet him,"" she said. ""Pretty much, he just loved his dog and he walked around with his dog all the time."" Police arrived at his apartment Tuesday night to collect DNA samples and released him into the custody of his lawyer early Wednesday. Neighbors say they didn't see him return to the apartment.  See investigation's timeline » . Clark was arrested early Thursday at a Super 8 motel in nearby Cromwell. There were reports that Clark was scheduled to wed his roommate and girlfriend, Jennifer Hromadka, also a lab technician in Yale's Animal Resources Center, in December 2011. CNN could not confirm the report, and an Internet wedding page purportedly announcing the impending nuptials had been taken down Thursday. Hromadka's MySpace page was private as of Tuesday evening, but several media outlets reported she had posted messages about Clark last year after hearing a ""rumor of a fling."" ""My boyfriend, Ray, if you don't know him, has no interest in any of the other girls at [the Yale Animal Resources Center] as anything more than friends,"" she reportedly wrote. She said Clark had a ""big heart"" and tried to see the best in people, even if he didn't always make the best decisions. ""He is a bit naive, doesn't always use the best judgment, definitely is not the best judge of character, but he is a good guy,"" she reportedly wrote.""He thinks everyone deserves a second chance and has a hard time hurting people's feelings, and it takes him getting burned to learn.""

""I have always wanted to catch up with him, but I didn't want this to happen for me to try to find out how he was doing,"" he said. Clark is being held on $3 million bond, Lewis said, but he would not provide details of what prompted Clark's arrest or whether DNA linked Clark to Le's murder. He said Clark's arrest warrant was sealed, so he was prohibited from discussing the evidence.

"(CNN)  -- A 7-year-old boy from El Paso, Texas, was gunned down across the border in the violent city of Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, a spokesman for the Chihuahua state attorney general's office told CNN Tuesday. Raul Xazziel Ramirez had been visiting his father in Juarez on Friday evening when unknown gunmen fired on their vehicle at a roundabout, spokesman Arturo Sandoval said. At least 18 rounds from a 9 mm weapon were shot at the white 2000 Geo Tracker driven by Ramirez's dad, Sandoval said. The father, Raul Ramirez Alvarado, 35, died in the driver's seat. The younger Raul escaped from the vehicle, but was apparently shot in the back, Sandoval said. The boy's body fell forward in front of the vehicle. The shooting happened just before 8 p.m. Friday. No arrests had been made as of Tuesday, the spokesman said. Raul Xazziel Ramirez was a third-grader at Glen Cove Elementary School in El Paso, Ysleta Independent School District spokeswoman Patricia Ayala told CNN. ""It's a senseless tragedy that we're trying to come to terms with,"" she said. According to El Paso County records, Raul was just three weeks shy of his eighth birthday when he was killed. The boy lived with his aunt and uncle in El Paso, Ayala said. It was the first semester that Raul was registered with the district. Raul's classmates were spared the details of his death, but the school was nonetheless shocked at the boy's passing. Grief counselors were made available for both students and teachers, Ayala said. More than 2,200 killings have been recorded this year in Ciudad Juarez, out of a population of approximately 1.5 million people. A bloody turf war between warring drug cartels that started last year has made the city one of the most violent in the world. According to statistics from local prosecutors, Ciudad Juarez records about 10 murders a day. The bloodiest month this year has been September, with 476 killings reported. The violence has not spilled over significantly across the border to El Paso, but as Friday's shooting showed, the pain of one of the sister cities is shared by the other. Because of the ongoing investigation, Sandoval declined to say whether drug cartel activity was suspected in the killings of Raul and his father, but added that at least 90 percent of the city's homicides are drug-related. Raul was not the youngest victim slain this year. In early 2009, a 3-year-old girl was killed together with her father inside a vehicle that was targeted, Sandoval said.","NEW: Raul Xazziel Ramirez was just three weeks shy of his eighth birthday, records show .

"Vancouver, British Columbia (CNN) -- The tragic death of a trainer at Sea World last week revived a number of long simmering questions. While we still grapple with ""how did this happen?"" the central question for many revolves around the role of large mammals -- like Tilikum the killer whale -- in zoos and aquariums: Should they be there or not? Animals in zoos, aquariums and museums play an important and powerful part in our cultural and formal educational processes. Humans are inherently interested in nature. We are not very far removed from a time when being knowledgeable about nature was vital to life; you either knew how to find your dinner or you were dinner. Today, with well over 50 percent of our populations living in cities, we are rapidly becoming divorced from the realities of the animal world. The dialogue we see in the media, read on blogs and hear in conversation makes it clear that many people have lots of ideas about what's happening in our natural world, much of it not correct. This lack of knowledge is concerning in a world beset by environmental problems, where species are disappearing at an alarming rate. We need people to understand the changes taking place in our natural systems and appreciate that each of our actions has an impact. More interest and knowledge, not less, is essential. Zoos and aquariums provide access and a vital connection to the world of wildlife and our environment, helping to foster an understanding of nature and how it works, and an appreciation for why it matters. Most professionally operated zoos and aquariums, such as those accredited by the Canadian or American Associations of Zoos and Aquariums, are dedicated to increasing engagement and raising awareness and participation in conservation issues. They conduct active programs that aid species survival, research and conservation, both at their public display facilities and in the field. The Vancouver Aquarium has operated our Marine Mammal Rescue (MMR) program since the mid 1960s. Each year, hundreds of marine mammals are rescued from situations of distress and rehabilitated by our dedicated team of staff and volunteers, led by our veterinarian. Their goal is to return marine mammals to good health so they can be released back to the ocean. The Vancouver Aquarium has not had killer whales on exhibit since 2001. However, our orca research continues in the field with experts working off the British Columbia coast to observe and study social interaction, behaviors, migrations, and feeding patterns. We do have beluga whales, including two calves born recently. Belugas are ideally suited to an aquarium environment. The calves' births have allowed researchers to study the social structure of a beluga family, and in collaboration with the University of British Columbia we have conducted beluga vocalization studies since 2002 to understand contact calls and other forms of communication between these beautiful and communicative animals. As our visitors see beluga whales and learn about their communication, natural history and the challenges they face due to climate change in the Arctic, a unique chain is created, moving from initial amazement of observing these creatures to the inspiration to care about them and finally to take action, in large or small ways, to protect their future by conserving their natural environment. We see our role as more important now than ever before. The time of simply displaying animals merely as curiosities is, thankfully, over. Our aquarium, and many others like it, represents often the only -- and the best -- opportunity for urbanites (particularly youth) to establish a connection with the natural world of animals. Sadly, many of us will never experience the joy and wonder of encountering animals in their natural habitat. But can get learn about them up close and personal in a modern and reputable aquarium or zoo. If you have had the good fortune to spend time in such an institution, and have seen the sense of awe and wonder on the faces of youngsters meeting a sea otter, for example, for the first time, you'll know what this is all about. What's more, having access to, and learning about, Tilikum and other whales in aquariums and marine parks since such amazing creatures were first displayed in the mid-1960s, has totally changed people's perceptions about them. Before then, killer whales were feared, termed ""wolves of the sea"", and even had a bounty on their heads in some places; being able to see them personally helped spark people's curiosity and interest. The resulting change in public perception was dramatic and swift, leading to their protection by the U.S. government in the 1970s under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. Today, most people revere killer whales and understand a great deal more about the challenges this species faces around the world -- with overfishing depleting their food supply, the impacts of climate change and pollution threatening their environment and their ultimate survival. With so many changes confronting nature and the animals that make it their home, human understanding and appreciation is critical. Animals that people are privileged to see in professional zoos, aquariums and similar institutions are vital to engagement, inspiration and conservation. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dr. John Nightingale.","John Nightingale says death of whale trainer raises questions about displaying captive animals .

"(CNN) -- ""The LHC is back,"" the European Organization for Nuclear Research announced triumphantly Friday, as the world's largest particle accelerator resumed operation more than a year after an electrical failure shut it down. Restarting the Large Hadron Collider -- the $10 billion research tool's full name -- has been ""a herculean effort,"" CERN's director for accelerators, Steve Myers, said in a statement announcing the success. Update: First collisions at the LHC on Monday . Experiments at the LHC may help answer fundamental questions such as why Albert Einstein's theory of relativity -- which describes the world on a large scale -- doesn't jibe with quantum mechanics, which deals with matter far too small to see. Physicists established a circulating proton beam in the LHC's 17-mile tunnel at 10 p.m. (4 p.m. ET) Friday, CERN said, a critical step towards getting results from the accelerator. ""It's great to see beam circulating in the LHC again,"" said CERN Director General Rolf Heuer. ""We've still got some way to go before physics can begin, but with this milestone we're well on the way."" Located underground on the border of Switzerland and France, the LHC has been inching towards operation since the summer. It reached its operating temperature -- 271 degrees below zero Celsius -- on October 8 and particles were injected on October 23. Now that a beam is circulating, the next step is low-energy collisions, which should begin in about a week, CERN said. High-energy collisions will follow next year. The collider has been dogged by problems. It made headlines early this month when a bird apparently dropped a ""bit of baguette"" into the accelerator, making the machine shut down. The incident was similar in effect to a standard power cut, said spokeswoman Katie Yurkewicz. Had the machine been going, there would have been no damage, but beams would have been stopped until the machine could be cooled back down to operating temperatures, she said. The collider achieved its first full-circle beam last year on September 10 amid much celebration. But just nine days later, the operation was set back when one of the 25,000 joints that connect magnets in the LHC came loose and the resulting current melted or burned some important components of the machine, Myers said. The faulty joint has a cross-section of a mere two-thirds of an inch by two-thirds of an inch. ""There was certainly frustration and almost sorrow when we had the accident,"" he said. Now, ""people are feeling a lot better because we know we've done so much work in the last year."" Mark Wise, professor of physics at the California Institute of Technology, said he's just as excited about the results that will come out of the LHC as he was last year and views the September 2008 accident as a delay rather than a devastating event. Wise noted that Tevatron, the collider at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois, has also had its share of failures but is generally considered to work just fine. ""It's a horribly complicated piece of equipment, it's not like there's not going to be problems along the way,"" he said. ""They will surmount those problems."" The LHC will probably be in operation more than 20 years, Myers said. But it won't be that long before scientists could potentially discover new properties of nature. The as-yet theoretical Higgs boson, also called ""the God particle"" in popular parlance, could emerge within two or three years, Myers said. Evidence of supersymmetry -- the idea that every particle has a ""super partner"" with similar properties in a quantum dimension (according to some physics theories, there are hidden dimensions in the universe) -- could crop up as early as 2010. For some theoretical physicists such as Wise, finding the Higgs boson and verifying every prediction of the Standard Model of physics would be the worst outcome. He wants the LHC to deliver surprises, even if that means no Higgs. ""When push comes to shove, the name of the game is 'what is nature,' and we're not going to know until our experimental colleagues tell us,"" Wise said. ATLAS and CMS are the general-purpose experiments designed to find the Higgs boson and other rare particles that have never been detected before. ALICE, another experiment, will explore the matter that existed some 10 microseconds after the Big Bang, said John Harris, professor of physics at Yale University and national coordinator of ALICE-USA. At that time, there was a ""hot soup"" of particles called quarks and gluons at a temperature of around 2 trillion degrees above absolute zero, he said. Although they have never been directly seen, these particles are theoretically the building blocks of the bigger particles -- protons, neutrons and electrons -- that form the universe as we know it.

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Health officials on Friday reported a slight decrease in H1N1 flu activity nationwide. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 43 states now have widespread flu activity, compared with 46 states last week and 48 states at the beginning of November. ""It's still much greater than we would ever see at this time of year,"" Dr. Anne Schuchat, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in a news conference. Schuchat added that while some parts of the country are seeing a small decline in flu cases, other areas, including Maine and Hawaii, have seen a bit of a surge. It's too early to know if the worst is over in terms of the flu season, she said. ""Even though we saw a little bit of a decrease this week, it is still higher than the peak activity in many years,"" she said. Flu season doesn't usually start until December. But when the H1N1 virus emerged in April, the spread of the flu never stopped, effectively stretching last year's flu season into the new one. The CDC also said 21 more deaths from H1N1 in children were reported in the past week, bringing the official toll of confirmed pediatric H1N1 deaths in the United States to 171. Schuchat said the number doesn't reflect the true picture. ""We believe the estimates we provided last week give a better picture of the full toll that the virus has taken in the first six months of the pandemic,"" she said. Last week the CDC reported that it estimated 540 children had died from complications of this flu virus so far. In an effort to limit further spread of the virus as millions of Americans begin traveling for the holidays, the CDC has launched a public awareness campaign. Schuchat urged everyone to take simple precautions. ""Travel only when you are well,"" she told reporters. ""Wash your hands often. ... Cover your cough and sneeze with tissues or with your sleeve. ... And get vaccinated against flu, particularly if you're in a targeted population."" Watch why Santa wants a flu shot . More people will be able to get vaccinated, according to the CDC, because more vaccine continues to be available. States have been able to order a total of 54.1 million doses of H1N1 vaccine so far, Schuchat said. ""That number is 11 million doses more than we were at a week ago."" In response to a report from Norway that a couple of people died from a mutated form of the H1N1 virus, Schuchat said the CDC is aware that the mutated form had been identified, but that H1N1 vaccine and antiviral medications still are effective against H1N1. Some cases of H1N1 that show resistance to the antiviral Tamiflu have been identified in North Carolina and Wales. But Schuchat said Tamiflu-resistant influenza viruses have been ""quite rare"" so far. Tamiflu doesn't cure the flu, but can reduce symptom severity and duration of illness by about a day if taken within the first day or two of getting sick.","43 states have widespread flu activity compared with 48 at beginning of month .

"(CNN) -- Judith Boutelle plopped herself down on Wednesday and prayed for a helicopter -- the only way out of town. She's one of the hundreds of tourists stranded by days of heavy rain near the majestic Incan ruins of Machu Picchu, in the mountains of southern Peru. The rain triggered mudslides that blocked a rail line leading out of a city near the ruins. Authorities have evacuated many by helicopter, but bad weather has posed challenges for them. ""There's stress,"" Boutelle said by phone to CNN, ""but we're comfortable."" She and her husband, Jerry -- 65-year-olds from Petersburg, Illinois -- went to Peru to see the famous ruins. They've been stuck in a town near the ruins for the last three days, waiting for choppers to whisk them out. News reports say the rain and floods have killed at least seven people in the region, including a tourist from Argentina. An estimated 10,000 people have been affected by the rain and 2,000 homes have been ruined in and around Machu Picchu, authorities said. James Fennell, spokesman of the U.S. Embassy in Lima, told CNN the Peruvians are saying about 2,000 people need to be evacuated from the region. Several hundred tourists have been stranded in Aguas Calientes, a town at the base of popular tourist attraction. There also have been reports of stranded people on the Inca Trail, a popular hiking trail that leads to Machu Picchu. Peru's Foreign Trade and Tourism Minister Martin Perez said Wednesday that the elderly, children and pregnant women have priority for evacuation. He denied reports of preferential treatment for foreigners, saying 103 of 475 tourists evacuated Tuesday were Peruvian. Watch iReport account of Peru flooding . Quoted by state media, Perez said authorities were planning to evacuate 120 tourists an hour but need ""the weather's help."" He said authorities could evacuate 840 tourists if they could get seven hours of decent weather. On Wednesday, poor weather threatened the ability of authorities to conduct evacuations, he said, and the forecast calls for rain through Friday. Fennell said some Americans might have left by Peruvian aircraft on Monday and 50 were evacuated by U.S. and Peruvian choppers on Tuesday. He said that as of Wednesday, officials estimate about 200 U.S. citizens were in Aguas Calientes. Fennell said four U.S. government helicopters arrived on Tuesday and two more were expected to help Peru in the evacuation. The Peruvian helicopters can accommodate up to 20 people but the U.S. aircraft carry only five. Peru also is bringing in food and water to the region, Fennell said. ""The evacuation operations were planned to continue today, weather permitting. The embassy is totally focused on getting Americans out,"" he told CNN. ""We're very grateful for their efforts,"" Fennell said of the Peruvian government. ""We're totally focused on working with them and getting everybody out quickly and safely."" The embassy says that the train to and from Cusco and Machu Picchu has been canceled because of landslides, and the roads in and out of Machu Picchu have been closed. One bridge had collapsed and water has covered the other. ""Peruvian authorities are working to open a route out of Machu Picchu,"" the embassy said in a message. Cusco is the closest major city to Machu Picchu. That's where Pamela Alvarez, 29, works as a receptionist at the Royal Inka Hotel. She said a Brazilian guest went to Machu Picchu, got stuck there with everyone else and has been unable to come back to the hotel for two days. ""All the people are in the train station, waiting for helicopters so they can get out to go to Cusco,"" she said. Boutelle said she and her tour group visited Machu Picchu on Sunday and stayed overnight on Monday, but she hadn't been able to leave since then. She said she and others have been been well-sheltered and well-fed at a hotel, but endured inconveniences. For example, people came to Machu Picchu for the day from their hotels in Cusco without the proper amount of clothing or medication for an extended period. Boutelle said she and her husband are among a handful left from their group, most of whom have been airlifted out. They had hoped to leave on Tuesday after wearily standing in an evacuation line for hours during a chaotic day where people jostled to get on helicopters. But they never made it out and were hopeful that they could leave as soon as possible. ""We hope today, but we're pessimistic about it,"" she said. ""It's going to take a long time to evacuate."" Several people fretted about the predicament. Roberto Rocafort, a 64-year-old tour manager, said officials in the town haven't been prepared to deal with the eventuality and he said conditions resembled a ""war zone"" for many of the people stranded. News reports say people are sleeping on the street, in gyms, schools, trains and tents. Wearing days-old clothing, sleeping outside, and lacking money and access to proper medications add up to an ""alarming, difficult and scary"" situation, Rocafort said. Rocafort said he's worried food supplies will dwindle greatly in days if help isn't accelerated. ""We need the U.S.A. to help us,"" Rocafort said. Rocafort said that thousands of Argentines enjoying their summertime are in the town. Argentine Consul in Lima Gabriel Volpi said that about 600 Argentine tourists were trapped and that one of them has died. A weather alert has been issued for southern Peru, which has received record rainfall over the past three days, according to the Peruvian national weather service. More rain is expected through Friday, though less than what's already drenched the region. A state of emergency has been declared in southeastern Peru, which includes Machu Picchu, according to Javier Velasquez, the president of Peru's Cabinet. Machu Picchu is the ancient Incan city on a mountain in the Andes, standing nearly 8,000 feet -- 2,340 meters -- above sea level in a tropical mountain forest. Known as the ""Lost City of the Incas,"" Machu Picchu is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and draws tens of thousands of international tourists every year.

"(CNN) -- Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina finally made it official Wednesday: She's running for Senate in California. The first woman to lead a Fortune 500 company made the announcement at an event in conservative Orange County, pledging that her focus will be on ""economic recovery and fiscal accountability"" ""The decisions made in Washington impact every family and every business, of any size, in America. Throughout my career, I've brought people together and solved problems, and that is what I plan to do in government: Set aside ego and partisanship and work to develop solutions to our problems,"" she told supporters. ""I will not settle for a jobless recovery, and we must start the important work of getting our financial house back in order,"" Fiorina added. ""Washington must show discipline to cut spending and create policies that encourage and empower businesses and put people back to work."" Fiorina, considered to be a moderate Republican with little history on social issues, will face off against conservative California Assemblyman Chuck DeVore for the GOP nomination. In a friendly statement Wednesday, DeVore said he looks forward ""to engaging [her] on the issues Californians care about."" A recent Field poll suggested that both Fiorina and DeVore polled at about 20 percent, with 60 percent of Republican voters undecided. The ex-Fortune 500 CEO, who left Hewlett-Packard in 2005 with a severance package estimated to be worth between $21.5 million and $40 million, is expected to enjoy a significant financial advantage over DeVore, who entered October with just $144,000 in the bank. The Fiorina-DeVore matchup has all the makings of another Republican battle between the conservative wing of the party and national leaders seeking the most electable candidate. Fiorina has claimed that the National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee is backing her bid, though an NRSC spokesman said no official endorsement has been made. Still, NRSC Chairman John Cornyn pointed to Fiorina in September as an example of a ""strong female candidate"" running as a Republican in 2010. A string of conservative bloggers have lined up behind DeVore, and South Carolina Sen. Jim DeMint said Tuesday that he was backing the assemblyman. The winner of that race will face three-term Sen. Barbara Boxer in November. Boxer's favorable rating stood at 48 percent in a recent Field poll, a number that gives Republicans hope she is vulnerable against a well-funded opponent. Boxer is known to be a formidable political opponent, but Fiorina said Wednesday that she's ready for the challenge. ""After chemothereapy, Barbara Boxer just really isn't that scary any more, especially when you know what to expect,"" said Fiorina, who battled breast cancer last spring. ""She has always taken the low road to high office."" Though spending most of her life outside of politics, Fiorina is no stranger to the campaign trail, having served as one of then-Republican presidential candidate John McCain's chief surrogates in 2008. Fiorina was eventually sidelined from that campaign after telling an interviewer that she didn't think either member of the GOP presidential ticket was qualified to run a major company. In an election season in which the state's economic condition is set to dominate the debate, Fiorina is now the second high-profile former CEO running for statewide office in California. Former eBay CEO Meg Whitman announced last month she is running for governor. National Democrats, meanwhile, appear eager to take on Fiorina, who left Hewlett-Packard five years ago amid controversy. ""The hallmark of Carly Fiorina's résumé is her tenure at Hewlett-Packard, where she laid off 28,000 Americans while shipping jobs overseas, just before taking a $21 million golden parachute,"" National Senatorial Campaign Committee spokesman Eric Schultz said. ""Given that record, the United States Senate is the last place Carly Fiorina should go next.""","Former Hewlett-Packard CEO was first woman to lead Fortune 500 company .

"White Plains, New York (CNN) -- Former New York Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik on Thursday pleaded guilty to charges of lying to Bush administration officials who vetted his unsuccessful 2004 nomination to be homeland security secretary. Kerik admitted to eight counts as part of a plea agreement with federal prosecutors, who are recommending a 27- to 33-month prison term. U.S. District Judge Stephen Robinson set Kerik's sentencing for February 18. In court papers, prosecutors said Kerik denied to a White House official that there was ""any possible concern"" about his relationships with the contractors involved in renovations to his apartment or that he had any financial dealings with prospective city contractors. Kerik, 54, had been scheduled to go to trial next week on a variety of corruption charges, including allegations that he received and concealed benefits of about $255,000 in renovations to his Riverdale, New York, apartment from a company seeking to do business with the city of New York. He pleaded guilty to that charge and several tax-related counts during Thursday morning's hearing. Robinson said he would take into account Kerik's life and career, which he said ""included good"" as well as wrongdoing. Kerik put his head in his hands at that point. Kerik has spent the past two weeks in jail after a judge revoked his bail. According to court papers released in late October, he violated the terms of his bail by leaking confidential evidence about his case to a lawyer who published the material online. Kerik served as New York police commissioner from 1998 to 2002 -- a tenure that included the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack that destroyed the World Trade Center and killed more than 2,700 people. He spent a brief stint in Iraq training the country's police force after the U.S. invasion in 2003, and was nominated by President George W. Bush for the post of homeland security secretary in 2004. However, he withdrew from consideration after allegations surfaced that he employed a nanny whose immigration status was murky. In 2006, Kerik pleaded guilty to accepting tens of thousands of dollars worth of gifts while he worked as city corrections commissioner, but under a plea agreement he paid $221,000 in fines and avoided jail time. His admission dogged the 2008 presidential campaign of his longtime patron, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who said his endorsement of Kerik had been ""a mistake."" Kerik made an unsuccessful appeal for clemency to Bush in late 2008, according to court papers released in October.

"(CNN) -- A series of spooky lights above parts of the northeastern United States Saturday sparked a flurry of phone calls to authorities and television news stations. NASA said strange lights seen in the Northeast on Saturday were caused by an experimental rocket. CNN affiliate stations from New Jersey to Massachusetts heard from dozens of callers who reported that the lights appeared as a cone shape shining down from the sky. However, the lights were the result of an experimental rocket launch by NASA from the agency's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia, a spokesman told CNN. Keith Koehler said the Black Brant XII Suborbital Sounding Rocket was launched to study the Earth's highest clouds. The light came from an artificial noctilucent cloud formed by the exhaust particles of the rocket's fourth stage about 173 miles high. Natural noctilucent clouds, also called ""polar mesospheric clouds,"" are ""found in the upper atmosphere as spectacular displays that are most easily seen just after sunset,"" according to a NASA statement published earlier in September. ""The clouds are the highest clouds in Earth's atmosphere, located in the mesosphere around 50 miles altitude."" Normally, noctilucent clouds are not visible to the naked eye and can only be seen when illuminated by sunlight below the horizon. The launch took place at 7:46 p.m. Saturday, just as the sun was setting for the day. Observation stations on the ground and in satellites will track the artificial noctilucent clouds created by the rocket for months, NASA said. ""Data collected during the experiment will provide insight into the formation, evolution, and properties of noctilucent clouds, which are typically observed naturally at high latitudes. ""In addition to the understanding of noctilucent clouds, scientists will use the experiment to validate and develop simulation models that predict the distribution of dust particles from rocket motors in the upper atmosphere,"" the NASA statement said. CNN's Greg Morrison contributed to this report.","Dozens in Northeast report seeing cone-shaped lights in sky .

"(CNN) -- The suspected link between Chinese drywall and toxic effects reported by thousands of U.S. homeowners was strengthened Monday by three preliminary reports issued by the federal government. The strongest link came from an analysis of air sampled inside dozens of homes containing drywall made in China. ""While the study of 51 homes detected hydrogen sulfide and formaldehyde ... at concentrations below irritant levels, it is possible that the additive or synergistic effects of these and other compounds in the subject homes could cause irritant effects,"" the Consumer Product Safety Commission said in its executive summary of the study. Two other preliminary studies found copper sulfide corrosion in metal components taken from homes containing the Chinese drywall. The drywall in question was imported from 2005 through 2007, when a housing boom and two active hurricane seasons created a shortage of building materials in the southern United States. Since then, the product safety agency has received nearly 2,100 reports from 32 states -- but mostly from Florida, Louisiana and Virginia -- of homeowners complaining of a rotten-egg smell, sickness, failed appliances, and corroded wires and pipes. Many have moved out of their homes. In some cases, insurers have refused to reimburse them. The air study tested 41 houses containing Chinese drywall and compared those findings with air from inside 10 homes in the same geographical areas whose homeowners had not complained, said Jack McCarthy, president of Environmental Health & Engineering Inc., which carried out the work. The investigators also examined materials such as copper pipes and wiring for corrosion, and looked at indoor air humidity, temperature and air exchange, he said. Copper and silver strips were left in the homes for two weeks and then examined for corrosion, he said. The result: in the 41 homes containing the problem drywall, there was a ""strong association"" between the high levels of hydrogen sulfide and the corrosion of the metals, he said. ""Temperature, humidity and air-exchange rates also appear to be contributing factors,"" McCarthy told reporters on a conference call, noting that higher moisture and temperature levels and lower air-exchange rates were connected with more corrosion. Formaldehyde, also a potential source of irritation, was found in both complaint and noncomplaint homes, he said. Though McCarthy cautioned that the study was not intended to examine health effects, ""we can say that the levels of the pollutants we found, particularly the hydrogen sulfide and formaldehyde, could possibly contribute to some of the health problems that have been reported to the CPSC."" McCarthy also said that not all Chinese drywall may be alike. Its risk ""depends on what it is made of, not necessarily what country it's from,"" he said. The next step is to determine how to identify homes with the corrosive materials and how to fix them, said Scott Wolfson, the product safety agency's director of information and public affairs, who noted that the investigation is the largest in the agency's history. He said none of the tainted drywall entered the United States this year. Hundreds of thousands of suspect boards have been stockpiled in warehouses; their owners have been told it will not be sold, he added. Several weeks ago, agency representatives traveled to China, where they visited mines, factories and government officials to determine the scope of the problem, which is still not clear, Wolfson said. ""The CPSC is working hard to determine how many homes in how many states are affected,"" he said, adding that the data do not support the widely reported figure of 100,000 homes. Wolfson said the Chinese helped investigate. ""They're committed to helping us with the technical side of this investigation,"" he said. Though the study raises suspicions that the drywall is responsible for the health effects reported by some families, Wolfson said a causal association has not been proved. ""The work continues,"" he said. ""The work toward an exact nexus between drywall and effects is still ongoing."" Wolfson called on the news media to help alert homeowners in affected houses to report the problem. Some may be hesitant to report because they are afraid their insurers will drop their coverage, he said, but he pointed out that the reports can be made confidentially. ""We will make sure that you are not harmed in any way by reporting to the government,"" he said. Monday's report did not surprise Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida, who said the product safety commission's chairwoman, Inez Tenenbaum, told him Monday she did not know when further testing would be completed. ""I am very disappointed with the whole process, and especially that the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] and EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] can't say whether drywall is harmful to people's health,"" he told CNN. ""Common sense says otherwise, but we still lack definitive answers."" Joan Glickman, who moved out of her townhouse in Pompano Beach, Florida, after her wiring and air conditioning failed, said Monday's report told her nothing new. ""It was a huge letdown because it still didn't tell me how to fix it, who's going to fix it, how do we go about fixing it, where the money comes from,"" said Glickman, who moved in with her mother. ""This has left us in such a mess."" CNN's Rich Phillips contributed to this story from Miami, Florida.","Air samples from 41 homes containing drywall made in China are analyzed .

"(CNN) -- Refugees at a settlement in southwestern Uganda have barricaded all roads into the camp to protest a food-aid disruption they say has caused the deaths of several children, refugee leaders said Tuesday. ""We have spent three months without any food supplies from government nor from any food relief or humanitarian agency,"" Congolese refugee leader Serugendo Sekalinda said by telephone. The protest began Tuesday after the deaths of three children Monday night, refugees said. Those were the latest of dozens of children who have died in the past two weeks due to hunger, refugee leaders said. But Needa Jehu Hoyah, a spokeswoman for the United Nations refugee agency, known as the UNHCR, told CNN by telephone from the Ugandan capital, Kampala, that no children have died in the Nakivale settlement, which has tens of thousands of refugees. ""We have a malnutrition program [in Nakivale] for children, [but] no children have died of hunger there,"" she said. The UNHCR, along with the U.N.'s World Food Program and the Ugandan government, will deliver a food shipment to the settlement Wednesday, Hoyah said. Uganda's disaster preparedness and refugees minister, professor Tarsis Kabwejyere, told CNN that the refugees living in that camp -- most of whom fled fighting in the Democratic Republic of Congo -- would have their full rations Wednesday. For a time they've been getting half rations, he said. ""By tomorrow there will be no food crisis at that settlement,"" Kabwejyere said. ""We do our best to make sure humanity survives, even in the hardships in refugee settlements, so people have a reasonable existence."" The food shortage came about as a result of a disruption in the food supply chain and a shortage of money for food, the minister said. Hoyah agreed that there ""were issues with the food pipeline."" Protesters at the Nakivale settlement, about 400 kilometers (248 miles) southwest of Kampala and 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) north of the Ugandan border with Tanzania, gathered at the homes where the most recent deaths of children have occurred, Sekalinda said. ""We are demanding to be relocated to another country where we can be protected from death caused by hunger,"" he said. While the settlement's population is composed mainly of refugees from the Democratic Republic of Congo, it also houses refugees from conflicts in Rwanda, Ethiopia, Somalia, Eritrea and Kenya. Nakivale is the largest and oldest of the five refugee settlements in Uganda, having opened more than two decades ago. People living there are provided small plots of land on which to grow crops, and they often build huts made of mud, water and thatched grass. As many as 155,000 refugees live in all the camps in Uganda, according to the UNHCR. As of January of this year, there were also an estimated 853,000 internally displaced persons, or IDPs, the UNHCR says on its Web site. The IDPs were forced from their villages in the past decade by attacks from the Lord's Resistance Army, which wants to create a democratic government in Uganda based on the Bible's Ten Commandments. Last week, an African Union summit in Kampala endorsed a declaration to end the forceful displacement of people in all of Africa. Delegates to the poorly attended summit also pledged to aid refugees and IDPs by training them in vocational skills so they could find work during and after their forced displacement.

"(CNN) -- Nobel laureate Norman E. Borlaug, an agricultural scientist who helped develop disease-resistant wheat used to fight famine in poor countries, died Saturday. He was 95. Norman Borlaug received a Congressional Gold Medal from then President George W. Bush on July 17, 2007. Borlaug died from cancer complications in Dallas, Texas, a spokeswoman for Texas A&M University said. A 1970 recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, Borlaug was a distinguished professor of international agriculture at the university. Borlaug started at Texas A&M in 1984, after working as a scientist in a program that introduced scientific techniques for preventing famine in Mexico, according to the university. Until recently, he traveled worldwide working for improvements in agricultural science and food policy, said Kathleen Phillips, a university spokeswoman. Borlaug was known as a champion of high-yield crop varieties, and other science and agricultural innovations to help fight hunger in developing nations. iReport.com: Tour Borlaug's boyhood farm . ""We all eat at least three times a day in privileged nations, and yet we take food for granted,"" Borlaug said recently in an interview posted on the university's Web site. ""There has been great progress, and food is more equitably distributed. But hunger is a commonplace, and famine appears all too often."" He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1977, and the Congressional Gold Medal in 2006, according to the university's Web site. The agriculture institute at the university was named after him in 2006. Borlaug also created the World Food Prize, which recognized the work of scientists and humanitarians who have helped fight world hunger through advanced agriculture, the university said. A memorial service will be held at the university at a later date.","Borlaug died at the age of 95 from complications caused by cancer .

"PERUGIA, Italy (CNN) -- A judge Tuesday convicted Rudy Guede, a native of the Ivory Coast, in last year's murder of a British woman in Italy and sentenced him to 30 years in prison. Briton Meredith Kercher was found dead in her Perugia apartment last November. Judge Paolo Micheli also ruled that adequate evidence exists to try an American woman, Amanda Knox, and her former Italian boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, in the killing of Meredith Kercher, said defense attorneys and Francisco Maresca, the lawyer for the victim's family. Their trial will begin December 4. Guede, Knox and Sollecito have all denied wrongdoing. Guede's attorney said he will appeal the conviction and sentence. Kercher, a 21-year-old exchange student at the University of Perugia, was found nearly a year ago, dead in her bed, with a knife wound to her neck. Official reports said Kercher may have been sexually assaulted before she died and that she bled to death. Members of Kercher's family spoke to reporters following the court proceeding. John Kercher Jr., one of the woman's brothers, said it was ""overwhelming"" to be in the same room as Guede when the judge convicted and sentenced him. But Lyle Kercher, a second brother, said that ""pleased"" wasn't the right word for the family's feelings, noting that his sister was murdered. ""Satisfied"" was more appropriate given the circumstances, he said. At his lawyers' request, Guede, hoping for a lesser sentence, received a separate fast-track trial from Knox and Sollecito. Lawyers for Sollecito, 24, and Knox, 21, asked that their clients -- who have been in jail since shortly after the murder -- be allowed to stay under house arrest if indicted. However, Sollecito's attorney, Luca Maori, and Knox's attorney, Carlo Dalla Vedova, said the judge had not ruled on their request. They expect an answer in coming days, they said. Prosecutors allege Guede committed sexual violence against Kercher with the help of Knox and Sollecito. They have said the three then strangled and stabbed the British student and took money, credit cards and cell phones in an attempt to make it look like the crime occurred during a robbery. Guede has admitted being in the villa when Kercher was killed, but has said an unknown assailant killed her while he was out of the room. Police say a bloody footprint from a shoe next to Kercher's body came from Sollecito. They also say investigators found traces of blood belonging to both Knox and Kercher mixed together in a bathroom adjacent to the room where Kercher died. Both Knox and Sollecito have given what prosecutors have said are confusing and contradictory accounts of what happened the night Kercher was killed.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN)  -- The five Americans arrested in Pakistan amid suspicion that they were plotting terrorist attacks were transferred on Saturday from the small town where they were seized to a more secure location in a larger city, police said. The U.S. citizens were taken from the town of Sargodha, where they were arrested at a home on Wednesday, to Lahore. A police interrogation report dated Thursday focused on one of the suspects, identified as Ahmed Abdullah Minni, a 20-year-old born in Virginia. The report said he regularly goes online to watch attacks on the U.S. military in Afghanistan and that he left comments praising the actions. That caught the attention of militants, and he was eventually contacted by a person named Saifullah, the report said. After contact had been made, a Yahoo! e-mail account was set up so the men and militants could communicate, the report says. E-mails were never sent from the account, but people would leave messages in the draft sections of the e-mail account and delete them after reading them, the Pakistani police report said. ""This mode of communication enabled them to pass on messages without fear of interception by the FBI,"" the report said. It said the suspects made a plan with Saifullah to go from Pakistan to Afghanistan. They gathered in Karachi and left for Hyderabad on December 1. They tried to hook up with two militant groups -- Jaish-e-Mohammed and the Jamaat-ud-Dawa -- but neither of them showed interest. The FBI said Pakistani authorities detained the men -- four of whom it said were found to have American passports. Along with Minni, there were snapshots and brief profiles of only four others -- Umar Farooq, Aman Hassan Yemer, Waqar Hussain Khan, and Ramy Zamzam -- all from the Washington D.C. area. The five had been formally arrested. A sixth man -- Khalid Farouk, father of Umar -- had been taken into custody by police in Sargodha and was being questioned at a safe location. Authorities have said Khalid Farouk has not been considered a suspect. CNN's Nasir Habib contributed to this report.","Suspected terrorist plotters were moved to a more secure location in Lahore, police said .

"London, England (CNN) -- Police in London have reached a settlement with the family of Jean Charles de Menezes, whom officers shot dead in 2005, mistaking him for a suicide bomber. The police offered ""a further unreserved apology"" for the death of de Menezes in 2005, plus an undisclosed compensation package, the police and the de Menezes family said in a joint statement. ""All litigation between them arising out of the tragic death of Jean Charles de Menezes has been resolved,"" the statement added. De Menezes was killed on a London Underground train weeks after four suicide bombers struck on the London transport system on July 7, 2005. The controversial shooting of the unarmed Brazilian man sparked a number of investigations, including one that found police acted illegally. A jury found in 2007 that London's Metropolitan Police Service broke health and safety laws in the shooting. It did not examine the cause of death. Jurors at a 2008 inquest found that the police who shot de Menezes did not shout a warning before firing at him. They also found that de Menezes did not advance toward armed officers on the subway train, which would have given them a reason to shoot. But the coroner at the inquest, who acted as the judge, had told the jury members they could not return a verdict of unlawful killing. They returned an open verdict in the case, meaning the jury was unable to establish a cause of death. De Menezes' family called the proceedings a ""whitewash"" because jurors were not allowed to consider a verdict of unlawful killing. De Menezes was killed July 22, 2005, a day after four failed bombings aboard the London transit system. Two weeks earlier, four suicide bombers blew apart three London subway trains and a bus, killing 52 people and wounding 977. The city was on edge as police sought the four failed bombers. Officers staking out a home in south London saw and followed de Menezes, 27, believing he was one of the suspects. They trailed him as he traveled on a bus and into a subway station, where they chased him onto the platform and into a train, and shot him dead. The Independent Police Complaints Commission concluded in 2007 that de Menezes was innocent of anything that might have justified police action. ""We made a most terrible mistake,"" Acting Police Commissioner Paul Stephenson said at the time, adding police needed to learn from the incident. ""I am sorry."" The shooting was one of several issues that led to the resignation last year of Police Commissioner Ian Blair. CNN's Melissa Gray in London contributed to this report.","UK police reach settlement with family of Jean Charles de Menezes, whom police shot dead in 2005 .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- People in big cities walk past them every day -- street performers, or buskers. Some are talented, some are not, and most aren't performing for a cause greater than themselves. But on Monday, 12-year-old Abby Miller was. Abby Miller sings for her friend Taylor Love outside Washington's Union Station on Monday. She was performing outside Washington's Union Station to help her 4-year-old friend, Taylor Love, who is suffering from cancer. Abby sat in front of the station with a couple of her friends, singing songs and strumming a guitar. Passers-by seemed to notice the girl's singing talent, stopping to listen in the chilly weather, with a few putting money in a bucket at Abby's feet. Abby said the money will help support Taylor's family. A few more stopped to write messages on ""Love Notes,"" little cards designed to encourage Taylor Love through the tough time. ""Her mom reads them to her before she goes to bed at night,"" Abby said. ""Taylor gets excited for them and she loves getting them read to her because she likes knowing that people are supporting her and people are actually thinking of her."" Taylor has neuroblastoma, a cancer that affects the nervous system. According to her Web site, she is in remission, but this type of cancer has a high risk of recurrence. There has been little research on the illness, of which there are about 650 new cases in the United States each year. Mike Gillette, a family friend of both Taylor and Abby, brought the two girls together. While raising money and support for Taylor is important, he said, he thinks Abby's outreach can help bring more critical awareness for the devastating disease. ""She really wanted to reach people all over the country,"" he said. Gillette said he has taken Abby to do similar performances in the District of Columbia, New Jersey and Virginia, and estimates they've raised thousands of dollars and have gotten people to write several hundred ""Love Notes."" Abby does more than just raise money and awareness for her friend. Taylor's mother, Aimee, said that although Abby is eight years older than Taylor, the two see each other often and have a special connection that helps her get through her daughter's illness. ""I think it's amazing for a 12-year-old Abby to be drawn to my daughter, who is 4 and wants to inspire other children,"" Aimee Love said. ""The joy I see in Taylor when she sees Abby brings a light into my life."" Taylor's family said her treatments are terribly painful. But Abby said Taylor has enormous character. ""She's the most happy girl in the world, which I think is just incredible,"" Abby said. ""She's so much fun to be around. She's a little 4-year-old girl but she's got a heart of like a thousand grown adults."" Aimee Love said her daughter feels the same way about Abby. ""It gives her someone to aspire to, someone to be inspired by,"" she said.","Abby Miller sings, plays guitar to help 4-year-old friend with cancer .

"(CNN) -- It's a good thing he didn't go with ""@andrew."" Drew Olanoff wants to benefit the LiveStrong charity because of the support the foundation has given him. Drew Olanoff, cancer-fighter and blogger, is auctioning off his enviable Twitter username ""@drew"" to benefit the LiveStrong foundation. Since Tuesday, its value has already been raised to $1 million, thanks to that other Drew -- last name Carey. ""I thought we would find a Drew who would bid $10,000 on the last day and that was it,"" Olanoff said. ""I certainly didn't think Drew Carey would get wind of it."" Get wind he did. The Cleveland comedian raised the stakes on Saturday, first tweeting an initial bid of $25,000 only to quadruple it, offering up $100,000 if his Twitter followers totaled 100,000 by the auction's closing at midnight on November 9. Olanoff was taken back by Carey's generosity, whom he's never met nor spoken to, but it seems Carey wasn't done yet. In the middle of an interview yesterday with CBS (the corporation writing Carey's checks, as he's the host of the network's ""The Price is Right""), he upped the ante from $100,000 to a cool $1 million if he gets the same amount of followers by midnight on December 31. Judging by how quickly the follower count increases every time his @DrewFromTV Twitter page is refreshed -- on Thursday evening, he was rapidly approaching 66,000 followers -- Carey is well on his way to doing so. Of course, if he doesn't reach a million followers, the donation will be prorated: If there are 500,000 followers when the clock strikes midnight, then $500,000 will be given to LiveStrong. It may seem like Carey's gotten himself into some sort of popularity game, but it's not about amassing millions of followers or the Twitter name, Olanoff said. ""There are obviously going to be skeptics, but Drew Carey is new to Twitter. Celebrities can get followers; Ashton Kutcher has 3 million,"" Olanoff told CNN. ""What he's saying is, 'Follow me; you're worth a dollar, and it's going to LiveStrong.' "" This isn't the first time Olanoff's stirred up the ""Twitter-verse."" From the minute he was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease in late May, he decided his cancer was of the social variety, and turned to Twitter to air his frustrations. ""I'm a very public person, I'm a geek, and I've been on Twitter for years,"" Olanoff said. ""I realized this is serious, and I started to blame things on my cancer. I'm not a whiny person and I didn't want to get negative [so the site] it was a nice way for me to focus all of my anger and being upset and worrying. "" With the help of a friend who's also suffered from Hodgkin's disease, Olanoff set up BlameDrewsCancer.com, where tweeters can blame his cancer for any and everything that's gone wrong, in 140 characters or less. Lance Armstrong, LiveStrong's founder, blamed a broken collarbone on it, while Alyssa Milano found Drew's cancer to be at fault for her inability to resist chocolate drizzled popcorn; she then tweeted an offer to help out Drew's cancer awareness campaign in whatever way she could. Famous or not, Olanoff found comfort in those tweets. ""When I would go through my chemo treatments every two weeks, for me it felt like I had a huge support group, because when you're diagnosed with [cancer] you can feel alone,"" he said. As a result, Olanoff has decided to keep blaming cancer even though signs are pointing towards improved health; his last chemo treatment is November 2. Until midnight on November 9, his 30th birthday, Olanoff's resolved to round up as many @DrewFromTV followers as he can, and maybe accept Carey's invitation to meet up when Olanoff's back in Los Angeles. For now, Olanoff is resting up and tossing around new Twitter names. One in the running is @TheOtherDrew, but no word on how much that one could go for.","Drew Olanoff has placed his Twitter username up for auction to benefit charity .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- An $80 million research project aimed at giving people 50 active years after the age of 50 was launched by scientists at the University of Leeds in northern England Tuesday. The challenge is to ensure old people stay as fit as Brisbane centenarian Ruth Frith, seen competing at shot put during World Masters Games in Sydney this month. About half of the babies born in Western countries today will live until they are 100 years old, according to recent research published in the medical journal The Lancet, so the challenge is to ensure they remain active throughout their old age. While most of us will live longer than our parents and grandparents, the aging population means that in coming decades more people will suffer from age-related conditions such as osteoarthritis, heart disease and chronic back pain. Obesity and increased physical activity also put more pressure on our joints, causing them to wear out faster. Scientists at Leeds University envisage that many of the body parts that flounder with age could be upgraded using own-grown tissues and more durable implants. This will mean artificial hips, knees and heart valves, for example, lasting far longer than the current 20-year typical lifespan. ""Our work is driven by the concept of 50 more years after 50 -- that is, making our second 50 years of life as healthy, comfortable and active as our first, so we can enjoy a higher quality of life,"" explains Professor John Fisher, who is an expert in artificial joints and tissue regeneration. ""We now have the technology available to do astonishing things, such as repairing the body by growing healthy new tissue through biological scaffolds and stem cell therapy. And a new generation of prosthetic hip and knee joints that last longer will avoid the need for further replacements."" Fisher says the center also hopes to gain a better understanding of degenerative diseases to allow for early diagnosis, rather than having to treat someone when they are already in crippling pain. ""For example, we're developing biosensor tools that can detect the presence of antibodies and proteins in the blood. All of these technologies will ultimately reduce suffering in patients through more timely interventions, shorter hospital stays and quicker recovery times."" So how do you feel about this. Are you looking forward to your old age? Do you believe you will remain active?

"(CNN)  -- Jordan Belfi has a great job: He plays Adam Davies on the HBO show ""Entourage,"" a comedy series that takes a look at the life of a young actor, Vincent Chase, and the old friends who surround him in Hollywood. Jordan Belfi arrives at the premiere of ""Entourage"" season six in Los Angeles, California. Davies is one of the few characters on the show who has the ability to shake one of the central figures: the unshakeable agent Ari Gold. Belfi has been around since the early days of ""Entourage"" and remembers the humble beginnings of his character's career as an agent under Gold's direction. Since that first season, Davies has risen to become Ari's chief rival on the show. Belfi believes conveying the tension between him and Ari is easy, based on the great material he's given. ""It's a testament to the writing by Doug Ellin, the creator of the show. It's just on the page,"" Belfi said. ""When you get setups and writing and dialogue and scenes that good, it makes your job that much easier."" CNN talked to Belfi, who's also in the movie ""Surrogates"" (opening Friday), about his experiences on the show and his inspiration for the role. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN:  A lot of fans really missed that rivalry between you and Ari Gold. Talk a little about how you and Jeremy Piven kind of prepare for that and try to make that real on screen. Belfi: Adam Davies has become ... one of the few characters on the show that really knows how to get under Ari's skin and push his buttons. Ari is an entertaining character, and it's fun to watch him go after things, but people really enjoy kind of when Ari's off balance. That interplay, that back and forth, particularly the sort of thing that's happening now [on the show], the constantly one-upping each other, is just really fun to watch. It's entertaining. And I get that response from a lot of the fans of the show. They love Adam Davies for that reason because he just knows how to do it. Jeremy ... [is] an actor with so much power and force and impact that you're sort of forced to up your game. You're really present in the moment. And when you're there and you're really going back and forth, that's when the sparks really fly. CNN: Talk little bit about the inspiration you draw from to play Adam Davies. Belfi: I started way back on season one in the beginning of the show. And back then, Adam Davies was still in his cubicle. So a lot of the inspiration came from meetings I had when I was starting out -- you know, behavior I experienced from agents and other industry people when I was starting out. I was in a not-too-dissimilar position. ... And I think that's what people really respond to. There's an absolute foundation of truth -- almost scary truth -- to the things Adam says, the things Ari does, all that kind of stuff. And it's why it's such a visceral experience for people in the industry and fun for people that happen not to be in the industry. CNN: What are your thoughts on Adam Davies as a person? Belfi: What gives Ari a little bit of his soul, his heart, is that we have all these scenes with his wife and his family, and you really get to see him as a dad. ... [But] we haven't gotten to see any of the personal life of Adam Davies. So I don't know if there's anything yet to kind of balance out those ruthless qualities he has. But I think he's the kind of agent that I'd certainly like to have if you're that actor trying to go after that job. You want that agent who's going to beg, borrow and steal to help prove that you're the guy. So in that respect, it seems like he's someone you'd want on your side. And the thing is, I think that's what made the rivalry between him and Ari so great. You know when he was coming up, he probably did a lot of the same things [as Ari] and ran over people in similar kinds of ways. They're really kind of the same in a lot of ways. So you're either best friends or mortal enemies when you share that much in common with somebody. CNN: Exempting Davies, who's your favorite character on the show and why? Belfi: Ah! Impossible question! I have to exempt Adam Davies from the answer? ... If I absolutely, gun-to-my-head have to choose, there's a quality about [Chase's brother] Drama that I've always loved. And it was maybe more prominent in the first couple of seasons than it is now because it's evolved slightly. The quality that I always found the most entertaining, is that Drama was always this mix of desperation and simultaneous pride. And that's really funny. You know at the beginning he was just scratching, begging for something, some chunk of the game or to get back in the game. But he simultaneously kind of knows it all. And that mix is a great comedic mix, comedic recipe. It was both funny and heartbreaking.   CNN: Of course, our diehard ""Entourage"" fans would love to get some scoop on the coming story lines. You've gotta give us something. Belfi: A little something? Well, I don't think I'd be giving away too much to say that Adam might get Lloyd. In terms of the story line, there's some stuff that I'm told with Drama and his going after this role on ""Melrose Place"" and the screen test for that role and the ups and downs of that. And also, some big things happen between Eric and Sloane. But in terms of the really exciting stuff between Adam Davies and Ari, I guess I'll say this: At the end of season two, when Ari is trying to form his coup, to break up the agency, and Adam is the one who rats him out and gets him fired and humiliated and causes that whole thing ... In the amazing way that Doug has constructed it, all that stuff from the end of season two comes full circle. There's this one thing that happens that will really stand out and that people will talk about. So some fun, exciting stuff to look forward to.","Jordan Belfi plays acting agent Adam Davies on the HBO show ""Entourage""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- White House communications director Anita Dunn fired back at criticism from TV commentator Glenn Beck on Friday, saying that a Mao Tse-tung quote Beck took issue with was picked up from legendary GOP strategist Lee Atwater. White House communications director Anita Dunn she picked up Mao Tse-tung from a legendary Republican. ""The Mao quote is one I picked up from the late Republican strategist Lee Atwater from something I read in the late 1980s, so I hope I don't get my progressive friends mad at me,"" Dunn told CNN. As for Beck's criticism: ""The use of the phrase 'favorite political philosophers' was intended as irony, but clearly the effort fell flat -- at least with a certain Fox commentator whose sense of irony may be missing."" On Thursday night's program, Beck showed exclusive video of Dunn discussing the communist leader, who was responsible for a cultural revolution in 1966 that included re-education camps and setting the army and students on witch hunts against his opponents. Millions of Chinese suffered or died, most notably teachers, writers, political opponents or anyone deemed a ""reactionary."" Dunn, taped in a speech in what appears to be a church, said the leader's philosophies were a guidepost for her own strategy on politics. She also praised the philosophy used by religious icon Mother Teresa. ""The third lesson and tip actually comes from two of my favorite political philosophers: Mao Tse-tung and Mother Theresa -- not often coupled with each other, but the two people I turn to most to basically deliver a simple point which is 'you're going to make choices; you're going to challenge; you're going to say why not; you're going to figure out how to do things that have never been done before."" The comments set Beck into a tirade. ""It's insanity. This is her hero's work,"" he said. ""She thinks of this man's work all the time? ""It would be like me saying to you, 'you know who my favorite political philosopher is? Adolf Hitler.' Have you read Mein Kampf? [She wants to] fight your fight like Hitler did,"" Beck said. Dunn recently blasted Fox News saying that the cable news organization often operates as either ""the research arm or the communications arm of the Republican Party."" ""When he [Obama] goes on Fox, he understands that he's not really going on it as a news network at this point. He's going to debate the opposition. And that's fine. He never minds doing that. ""They're widely viewed as a part of the Republican Party. Take [the GOP's] talking points, put them on the air, take [the GOP's] opposition research, put them on the air,"" Dunn said. Fox News in a statement to CNN said its programming was comparable to the editorial page of a newspaper. Still, Beck wasted no time Thursday in using Dunn's comments to blast the Obama administration for promoting what he deems a radical agenda. ""America, how many radicals is it going to take? How many radicals surrounding our president before you understand that when the president said he wants to transform the country, he wants to transform it all right,"" Beck said. Dunn pointed out that during his presidential campaign and since being elected President Obama has been interviewed by Fox News and will be again in the future.  Watch more of Dunn's comments » . ""He'll go on Fox because he engages with ideological opponents,"" Dunn said. ""He has done that before, and he'll do it again."" But it's not just Dunn, a Democrat, who has used Mao as someone she reads. Media Matters for America, a liberal media watchdog group, points out that former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, also a Fox News contributor, quoted Mao in a 1995 Roll Call profile. ""War is politics with blood; politics is war without blood,"" Gingrich said, citing Mao. Karl Rove, another Fox News contributor, wrote in a December 2008 Wall Street Journal op-ed that President Bush ""encouraged me to read a Mao biography."" Beck led the charge against Obama's former green jobs czar Van Jones over a petition Jones signed in 2004 calling for an investigation into whether government officials deliberately allowed the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks to occur. Jones said of the petition on the Web site 911truth.org: ""I do not agree with this statement and it certainly does not reflect my views now or ever."" Jones has also come under fire for comments he made, also before his White House job, including those in a video on YouTube. In it, he uses a vulgar expression to describe Republicans. Jones resigned from his post in September, saying in a statement that he came to Washington to ""fight for others, not for myself."" ""I cannot in good conscience ask my colleagues to expend precious time and energy defending or explaining my past. We need all hands on deck, fighting for the future,"" Jones' statement said. Jones is a co-founder of colorofchange.org, a group that recently has been pressing advertisers to boycott Beck's program after Beck called Obama a racist.

"(CNN)  -- One of eight people killed in a southeast Georgia mobile home last month recently had been awarded $25,000 in a civil lawsuit, officials said. Guy Heinze Jr. faces eight counts of first-degree murder in last month's killings in a Georgia mobile home. Guy Heinze Sr., 46, was granted the award by the McIntosh County, Georgia, Magistrate Court in a suit over a mobile home that he owned, court officials said. He had not received the money as the ruling was under appeal. Heinze was found dead August 29 in his Brunswick mobile home along with six others. An eighth person died later at a hospital. Police said all of the victims died from ""blunt force trauma,"" but they did not provide any further details. Heinze's son, Guy Heinze Jr., 22, faces eight counts of first-degree murder in the deaths. Police suspect he acted alone, according to a statement from the Glynn County Police Department. The younger Heinze has made his initial court appearance via closed-circuit television from the Glynn County Detention Center, his attorney, Ron Harrison, said Tuesday. His preliminary hearing likely will come next week, Harrison said. The elder Heinze told relatives about the award days before his death, family members said. Court officials said the ruling was issued August 11, and an appeal was filed six days later. Harrison said he was aware of the award in the lawsuit but would not comment on it. Police also are aware of it, Glynn County Police Chief Matt Doering said, but he declined comment on whether it is being explored as a possible motive in the slayings.  Watch hints of a possible motive » . Harrison said he last saw his client on Friday, as he was not required to appear with him to hear the charges read. The younger Heinze ""continues to deny any involvement in the murders and urges anyone with information to contact authorities,"" he said Tuesday. He described his client as ""not good, disappointed, upset, angry."" Heinze called 911 to report the slayings, telling the dispatcher, ""My whole family is dead."" He was arrested just afterward and initially was charged with tampering with evidence and making false statements to a police officer as well as facing drug charges.  Hear the 911 call » . An arrest warrant said he provided police ""with false and misleading information about his whereabouts and involvement in the circumstances leading to him calling 911 to report the deaths of his family members"" and that he removed a shotgun from the mobile home and hid it in his car. He was arrested on the murder charges hours after being freed from jail on the initial charges. Family members said he was on his way to attend the visitation for the victims but was arrested before arriving. A police chaplain called relatives to tell them of the arrest, family members said. Police have not released the cause of death for any of the victims. Heinze told dispatchers in his 911 call they appeared to have been beaten to death. Funerals were held Saturday for seven of the eight victims. Besides the elder Heinze, they were Brenda Gail Falagan, 49; Russell D. Toler Sr., 44; Russell D. Toler Jr., 20; Chrissy Toler, 22; Michael Toler, 19; and Michelle Toler, 15. The funeral for the eighth victim, Joseph L. West, 30, is to be held mid-month. A ninth victim, a 3-year-old, was on life support at a Savannah, Georgia, hospital as of Saturday, her grandmother said. Guy Heinze Sr.'s father, William Heinze, told CNN affiliate WJXT-TV in Jacksonville, Florida, at the funerals that he doubted his grandson was responsible for the deaths. ""We want to know what really happened,"" he said. ""The police may think they know what happened, but we want to really know the truth.""

"(CNN) -- Milwaukee, Wisconsin, police have arrested a man whose DNA linked him to the bodies of nine women killed over 21 years, officials said at a news conference Monday night. Walter E. Ellis, 49, was arrested after police matched a DNA swab taken from him last week to the victims. Walter E. Ellis, 49, was arrested after police matched a DNA swab taken from him last week to DNA left on the bodies of nine women killed since 1986. Police said eight of the women were prostitutes and one was a runaway involved with drugs. They were all killed within a 3-square-mile area of Milwaukee's north side. ""This case was solved with shoe leather and science,"" Milwaukee Police Chief Edward A. Flynn said. ""Continuing advances in DNA technology have enabled us to link these homicide cases, and it was good police work pursuing numerous leads that led to the arrest of a suspect."" The homicides occurred between 1986 and 2007, police said.  See where the bodies were found » . Ellis was charged Monday with two counts of first degree murder relating to two of the deaths: 41-year-old Joyce Mims, who was killed in 1997, and 28-year-old Ouithreaun Stokes, who was killed in April 2007. Police said more charges are likely. It wasn't immediately clear whether Ellis had obtained an attorney. Police said other victims linked to Ellis through DNA were: Tanya L. Miller, killed in 1986; Deborah L. Harris, killed in 1986; Sheila Farrior, strangled in 1995; Florence McCormick, strangled in 1995; Irene Smith, killed in 1992; Carron D. Kilpatrick, killed in 1992, and Jessica Payne, killed in 1995. Flynn told CNN it was hard for investigators to discern a geographic pattern for the homicides. In the 20-year period, more than 2,000 slayings occurred in Milwaukee, he said -- 200 of them in the same area where the bodies were found. Another challenge investigators faced was the developing technology of DNA evidence. The technology in 2009 far exceeds that available in 1986 or even 2002, he said. It was only this year that police were able to link the nine homicides with the same DNA pattern. Even then ""we did not have anyone to match our DNA profile against, until we were able to get [Ellis'] toothbrush,"" he told CNN. A Wisconsin law passed in 2000 mandated the DNA collection from convicted felons. Ellis was released from prison in 2001 without having his DNA sample collected, Flynn said. Because his name had surfaced in the investigation and because he was also listed in two FBI databases, authorities decided to investigate him further and were able to obtain the search warrant that allowed them to collect his DNA from his toothbrush, the police chief said. News of Ellis' arrest shocked those who knew him. ""That was just my ex-boyfriend,"" his former girlfriend, Chanita, told CNN affiliate WISN-TV. She asked that her last name not be used. ""I didn't know nothing about nothing like this. I'm getting shivery now cause you're talking about some strangling stuff. Lord have mercy on me. I'm just a wreck right now. I can't believe this. I'm trembling in here. I'm shakin'."" Chanita said she dated Ellis for four years. ""I can't believe it. This is a shock,"" she told WISN. ""I got like goose bumps on my arms instantly when you told me that. I'm like no way -- not Walter -- I can't see him hurting nobody."" For relatives of the victims, the news brought mixed emotions. ""I knew they was gonna get him, I knew it,"" Patricia Donald, best friend of victim Deborah Harris, told WISN. ""Finally he can't hurt nobody anymore."" For her and others, like Sandy Farrior, whose daughter Sheila was linked to Ellis, it was news that helped bring closure. ""Late justice is better than no justice,"" he told WISN. In addition to advances in DNA technology, officials attributed the break in the case to the repeated investigation of cold cases by the Milwaukee Police Department's Homicide Task Force Cold Case Unit. Although Mims and Stokes were strangled about a decade apart, similar DNA on their bodies helped lead police to a suspect.  Watch where cops got DNA sample » . Mims was found strangled and lying on her back wearing only socks on June 20, 1997, in a small closet near a living room in Milwaukee, according to court documents. Police found DNA on her body, but there were no matches in the system, the court documents show. On April 27, 2007, Stokes was found strangled, partially clothed and lying face down in a living room in Milwaukee, according to court documents. When lab technicians tested the DNA found on her body, they found it directly matched the DNA found on Mims. On August 29 of this year, armed with a search warrant, police took a toothbrush and razor from Ellis' home. Testing showed the DNA found on Mims and Stokes was a match to Ellis, according to court documents. Ellis has been charged at least 10 times with varying offenses ranging from violent crimes to property crimes between 1981 and 1998, though some of the charges were dismissed, online court records in Wisconsin show. He was sentenced to five years in state prison after he pleaded no contest to a reckless injury charge in 1998. None of the victims linked to Ellis was killed during the time he was in jail. However, two men were charged in slayings later linked to Ellis, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Curtis McCoy was charged in October 1994 with killing Kilpatrick, but he was later acquitted by a jury, the newspaper reported. It also said Chaunte Ott, who was convicted of killing Payne, served 13 years in prison before being released in January, after DNA analysis showed semen found on the girl's body was not his. CNN's Gabriel Falcon contributed to this report.","DNA found on bodies of nine women matched to Walter E. Ellis, police say .

"(CNN) -- Somali pirates demanded a $7 million ransom for a British couple kidnapped aboard their yacht last week, a British agency said Friday. The British government says it won't pay. ""The government will not make substantive concessions for hostage takers, including the payments of ransom,"" the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office said. Paul and Rachel Chandler, who were snatched last week from their yacht in the Indian Ocean, had been held aboard a Singaporean cargo ship hijacked by pirates. They have been moved to a hijacked Spanish ship that pirates have stocked with more supplies and armed men, a local journalist in contact with the pirates said Friday. The pirates moved them to the Spanish vessel after elders in the Somali town of Haradhere refused a pirate request to allow the Chandlers ashore, the journalist said. The journalist's identity is not being disclosed for security reasons. After hours of negotiation, the couple spoke with Rachel Chandler's brother, Stephen Collett, on Friday -- a phone conversation that was videotaped by CNN's British affiliate ITN. In the conversation, Rachel Chandler confirmed only that they had been moved from the Singaporean cargo ship, but not their current location, the network reported. ""We're managing. They tell us that we're safe and that we shouldn't worry and that if we want anything, they will provide it in terms of food and, you know, water,"" an emotional Rachel Chandler told Collett. ""They're very hospitable people, so don't worry. ... Physically we're fine; physically, we're healthy."" Paul Chandler spoke slowly and carefully in the interview: . ""Rachel and I are here. We are fine,"" he told Collett. ""We know nothing here. It is nice to speak to you. I can only say we are well and that's as far as I can say."" Collett read a message to the captors, asking them to release his sister and her husband to show ""your compassionate nature."" ITN reporter Angus Walker noted that Paul Chandler's tone sounded more strained than during their conversation Thursday, when he laughed at one point and sounded more relaxed. In their Thursday conversation, Chandler told ITN that men with guns had boarded the couple's yacht, demanding money and taking everything of value. Paul Chandler spoke later with the BBC's Somali Service, reportedly saying, ""We are well and being looked after OK."" He said they were being fed and ""food is OK at the moment."" The pirates abandoned the Chandlers' yacht, the 38-foot Lynn Rival, which the British Royal Navy found drifting in international waters Thursday. The Chandlers set off from the Seychelles islands on October 21 bound for Tanzania, according to their blog. A distress beacon was activated on October 23, according to naval officials. Britain's Foreign Office said it has been in close contact with the couple's family. Pirates have been very active off the east coast of Africa in the past several years, operating out of lawless Somalia. Two vessels were attacked the day after the Chandlers set sail. One of them -- a cargo ship -- was successfully boarded and seized off the Seychelles, while the other fought off its attackers near the Kenyan coast. Thursday, pirates attacked and boarded a Thai-flagged fishing vessel about 200 miles north of the Seychelles, according to the European Union Naval Force. Attacks in the region have significantly increased this year, according to the International Maritime Bureau, which monitors shipping crimes. But successful attacks have gone down as a result of a strong presence of international monitors. The first nine months of this year has seen more pirate attacks than all of last year, the bureau reported October 21. From January 1 through September 30, pirates worldwide mounted 306 attacks, compared with 293 in all of 2008, it said. More than half of this year's attacks were carried out by suspected Somali pirates off the east coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden, a major shipping route between Yemen and Somalia. Out of those attacks, Somali pirates successfully hijacked 32 vessels and took 533 hostages. Eight people were wounded, four were killed and one is missing, the bureau said.","NEW: British government says it won't pay ransom .
