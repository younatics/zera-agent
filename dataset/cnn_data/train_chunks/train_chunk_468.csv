Police investigating the murder of a clergyman in his vicarage are exploring whether there are any similarities between his death and that of a 77-year-old woman in Worcestershire last month. Police hunting the killer of Betty Yates in Bewdley say they are working with officers investigating the stabbing of the Reverend John Suddards, 59, in Thornbury, South Gloucestershire, last week. After a tip off from the public, officers this morning arrested drifter Stephen Farrow, 47, at a property in Folkestone, Kent, in connection with the vicar's murder. Drifter: Police have arrested Stephen Farrow, 47, (left) over the murder of Rev John Suddards (right), after they were led to him at an address in Folkestone, Kent, by a tip off from the public . Mrs Yates, a retired teacher, was . found stabbed to death at the foot of the stairs at her home on the . banks of the River Severn on January 4. Detective Chief Inspector Neil . Jamieson, of West Mercia Police, said: 'We have been particularly . interested in the work by Avon and Somerset Police to investigate the . murder of Reverend John Suddards. 'We have been working together with them to examine similarities between that incident and the murder of Betty Yates. 'We will continue our unrelenting efforts to bring the offender responsible for this dreadful crime to justice.' Similarities: Betty Yates was found stabbed to death at her home in Bewdley, Worcestershire, on January 2 . Rev Suddards, 59, a former barrister, . was stabbed to death in his vicarage last Tuesday in the medieval market . town of Thornbury. He had previously told his . congregation at St Mary's Church that he was at risk of attack because . he regularly welcomed homeless and vulnerable strangers into his house . as part of his 'Christian duty'. Farrow's arrest came after police yesterday . named him as their prime suspect for the killing of Rev Suddards. Officers from Avon and Somerset . Police, in conjunction with Kent Police, went to an address in Black . Bull Road at 4.20am where Farrow was arrested on suspicion of murder and taken . into police custody. A Kent Police spokesman said he was . detained 'without incident' and no one was injured. His arrest comes . after Sussex Police said he was spotted last night in the Hastings and . Rother area of East Sussex. Detective Chief Inspector Simon Crisp, . who is leading the investigation into Mr Suddards' death for Avon and . Somerset Police, said: 'Early this morning, on our behalf, Kent Police . arrested Stephen Farrow on suspicion of the murder of the Reverend John . Suddards in Thornbury last week. His arrest follows a nationwide appeal . for information which we released yesterday. 'I would like to thank the public and . all those who have helped us to find him. It was as a direct result of . assistance from a member of the public that we were able to locate this . man and we would like to express our sincere thanks and gratitude.' Dawn raid: The house on Black Bull Road where police swooped and arrested Farrow at 4.20am this morning . Police continued their inquiries outside the vicarage where Rev Suddard's body was found . The community of Thornbury has been shattered by the death . It was unclear whether Farrow is the . same man recorded on CCTV sitting on a pavement outside St Mary's Church . last Monday between 6pm and 8pm, hours before Mr Suddards' body was . found. DCI Crisp earlier said a 43-year-old . man arrested earlier this week on suspicion of Mr Suddards' murder had . been interviewed at length and answered all questions put to him, and . had now been released on police bail. Police also seized a white van just . hours after the man was arrested on Tuesday night. The Citroen was . lifted on to a low-loader and taken away from a property in Knapp Road, . about a mile from the vicarage. It is believed a man in his 40s had been sleeping in it. Yesterday, officers were searching the Knapp Road house and grounds. Bachelor Mr Suddards took over the Thornbury parish six months ago after serving for 22 years in the Diocese of Chelmsford. Vicar John Suddards, pictured at a Christening, admitted he was at risk during a sermon because of the type of people he took in . Police attend the scene outside the vicarage next to St Mary's church, where the vicar's body was found by builders . Tragedy: St Mary's Church in Thornbury, Gloucestershire, where Rev Suddards has taken over as vicar last July . He told parishioners that he joined the Church when a serious road accident forced him to rethink his life. The theory that he was attacked by a . homeless drifter received added credence after his sermon last October . about the risks of inviting strangers into his home. Mike Spiller, a lay reader who had . supper with Mr Suddards five days before his death, said the vicar had . been enjoying his new ministry. He added: 'He was a good guy and he was settling in well. I . know of nobody who would have a grudge against him. He  was around here . last week – we were having a church meeting over some casserole.' Forensic teams were called in after Mr Suddards was found soon after 10am on Monday . Police search the roadside near the vicarage where Mr Suddards was apparently killed . Father Alex McAllister of the Catholic Christ the King Church in Thornbury described the vicar as a bright and 'lovely guy'. He said: 'When he said in his sermon a . few weeks ago that he took people in, I think he just meant he opened . his door to them. He wasn't a soft touch.' In a statement released by police, . the vicar's family said: 'We are devastated with the news of John's . untimely and shocking death. 'We would appreciate being left in peace while we struggle to come to terms with what has happened.' Detectives are trying to put together a picture of Mr Suddards' personal . and social life and are believed to have contacted clergy at his former . parish. It . also emerged that local Roman Catholic and Methodist churches were being . searched as part of the police inquiry amid fears religious officials . had been targeted. 'He was much loved': Rev John Suddards previously worked at St Nicolas Church in Witham, Essex . Recalling . Mr Suddards's words on the danger of his acts of charity, Meg Adnams, a . member of Oldbury-upon-Severn parochial church council, said: '[He] . gave a sermon and said it was a bit of a risky job being a vicar.' She added: 'He was a lovely man who wouldn’t have an enemy in the world.' The Venerable Geoffrey Sidaway, the Archdeacon of Gloucester, echoed Mr . Suddards's own words, saying: 'Sadly, this event highlights the . vulnerable nature of parish ministries in some of our communities . today.' He continued: 'Many clergy on a daily . basis open their homes and churches to people and that clearly can put . them in a vulnerable position.' And a parishioner, who did not wish to . be named, said the murder was 'worrying' for priests in the area. She . said: 'There are vagrants always around looking for money. The Bishop of Tewkesbury the Rt Rev John Went with the Archdeacon of Gloucestershire Geoffrey Sidaway (right), addresses journalists after Reverend John's memorial service . 'But that is what the church is all about. It is very worrying. Some of the priests are elderly and I worry about them.' The victim's sister Hilary Bosworth said: 'My family and I have been devastated to learn of John’s . untimely and shocking death.’ Another friend of the vicar, who asked not . to be named, added: 'John took his responsibilities very seriously. This meant responding to the needs of anyone who turned up at his door.' On Friday morning, the Bishop of . Tewkesbury told a congregation at St Paul's Church in Thornbury in a . sermon: 'Our hearts very much go out to you as a church community and a . wider community that will be stunned at this time and will have so much . to come to terms with over the coming months and indeed years.' Phil Barlow, 59, a district councillor . in Braintree, Essex, said Mr Suddards had conducted the wedding of his . daughter Lucy before he moved to Gloucestershire. He said: 'He cared very much for people and poured all his energy into his flock. 'He certainly had no enemies here and I have never known anyone that had anything other than kind words to say about him.' The Right Reverend Christopher Morgan, . Bishop of Colchester, added: 'Very many people – myself certainly . included – will have been grateful not only for John's pastoral ministry . but also for his human friendship. 'He has been cruelly snatched away: may he now rest in peace and rise to glory.'","Stephen Farrow this morning arrested in conviction with vicar's death .

"By . Sophie Borland . Last updated at 8:54 AM on 15th February 2012 . A third of family doctors say their patients are being put at risk in NHS hospitals because of ‘dangerously’ poor care, a survey has revealed. They liken wards to ‘factory production lines’ and admit they would not refer their own family. One said he would not even like his dog to be treated at one hospital. Care fears: Nearly a third of doctors say their patients are being put at risk in NHS hospitals because of poor standards (picture posed by models) One in ten thinks that in the past 12 months at least one of their patients died unnecessarily because the hospital either misdiagnosed them or they were not given the correct treatment. The poll exposes a widespread lack of faith in NHS hospitals. More than one in five (21 per cent) believe the care at their nearest hospital is so dire they would not want to be treated there themselves – and they would not send in their relatives. One family doctor in the North East said that when his wife recently went to hospital there was ‘no appreciation of the human side to her care’. ‘She was in a tunnel where she went in one side and came out the other as if on a factory production line,’ he said. Another unnamed GP in South London said that in the local hospital he was aware of ‘patients not being fed, not being washed, the sort of care that none of us would want ourselves or for our patients’. One from Romford, Essex, said he had written to the chief executive of Barking, Havering and Redbridge Hospitals telling her care was so bad that if he had his way he ‘would not refer a single patient’. Some 34 per cent of doctors said that in the past 12 months at least one of their patients had been subject to hospital care that was ‘dangerously sub-standard’. And nearly three quarters, 74 per cent, said patients had complained to them about the poor treatment on wards. 'Poor care': A GP said he would not send his dog to the Princess Royal University Hospital in Farnborough, Kent . A fifth said they had taken patients to one side before they were admitted to warn them about care. And a third (32 per cent) said they had written to NHS managers to voice their concerns. Another 18 per cent said the hospital care that either they or a family member had received was below standard. Five hundred GPs were questioned for the survey by family doctor magazine Pulse. Last year a series of damning reports by the Care Quality Commission, the Health Service Ombudsman and the Patients Association unearthed harrowing cases of neglect in many hospitals. But this poll reveals for the first time the extent of unease among the NHS’s own doctors. One Oxford GP said that when he asked John Radcliffe Hospital to investigate why his patient had died because staff had misdiagnosed her ovarian cancer, the trust replied saying it had done nothing wrong. Another, in Norfolk, said that his patients are ‘frequently’ being sent home from hospitals too early and many end up going back ‘within a few hours’. Katherine Murphy, of the Patients Association, said: ‘That so many GPs do not have faith in their local hospital is deeply concerning. These results should not be swept under the carpet.’ Dr Richard Vautrey, of the British Medical Association’s GPs committee, said doctors should raise issues directly with the hospital concerned, adding: ‘If we want the best care we must not stay silent when issues arise.’ A spokesman for the Department of Health said the poll only represented a ‘small proportion’ of the 40,000 GPs in the country. He added: ‘That said, we are never complacent about patient safety, and have made it very clear that unsafe care will not be tolerated. This is exactly why we want GPs to take charge of services, in order to arrange the care they think is best for their patients.’","'I wouldn't send my dog to Princess Royal University Hospital in Farnborough', says GP from Kent .

"By . Reuters Reporter . Last updated at 11:48 PM on 20th February 2012 . The Darlings tells a fictional tale about the downfall of a hedge fund and the wealthy family that owns it during Wall Street's 2008 meltdown, but many aspects of the novel are drawn straight from author Cristina Alger's reality. As a former Goldman Sachs analyst and bankruptcy attorney at a white-shoe law firm in New York, Alger knew that the twists and turns that led to many a Wall Street fiasco could make for a fascinating story. 'It's easy to see finance as something that happens in a conference room, but white-collar crime is fascinating,' she said. Recent history: Former Goldman Sachs analyst Christina Alger has based her new novel, The Darlings, on a hedge fund during the financial crisis in 2008 . 'No one's dying or no cars are blowing up, but it's incredibly fast-paced and interesting and complex.' The Darlings, which is released in the U.S. today, is one of the first works of fiction centered on the events of the 2008 financial crisis. The book begins with an apparent suicide, which sets off a series of investigations and cover-ups by a web of characters that includes lawyers, financiers, government officials and journalists. The dynamics and loyalties of the blue-blooded Darling family that runs the hedge fund, founded by patriarch and billionaire Carter Darling, are also thrown into tumult as the foundation of the family's wealth and status is threatened. Ms Alger, 31, knows a thing or two . about family businesses: her family founded prominent New York . investment firm Fred Alger Management. 'I grew up going to my dad's office, and family dinners were filled with chatter about work life' In addition to her professional experience, she said that she also drew on her family background to write the book. 'I grew up going to my dad's office, and family dinners were filled with chatter about work life,' she explained. 'One of the things I tried to draw . from in The Darlings was the sense that the whole family was involved in . the business, and the demise of the business in their case was really . like the demise of the family as a whole.' As Ms Alger tried to make sense of the . corporate scandals she witnessed as an attorney, she found that chalking . up bad behaviour to mere greed didn't quite get to the root of such . scandals. Tale of lost fortunes: Ms Alger's book is released in the U.S. today . As she pondered what could drive some investors to such extreme corruption, she found her thoughts circling back to family loyalties. 'One of the fun parts of writing the book for me was trying to get into the minds of people who caused huge amounts of damage professionally, and try to understand what their motivations were for the way they acted,' she said. The urge to protect and provide for children, parents, and spouses factor powerfully into the professional decisions of all characters in The Darlings, from CEO Carter Darling to whistle-blowing secretary, Yvonne. 'I had deep affection for all my characters, and didn't like to see anyone as purely bad or purely good,' she said. 'People act well, and people act badly, and they're all doing it for the best interest of their families.' Ms Alger said that another element in the collapse of firms such as Lehman Brothers and AIG was the widespread bending of rules by those high up in Wall Street's steel towers. This is reflected in the story as the Darling family scrambles to perform damage control once they become aware of the firm's problems. 'I think there were two sets of rules that were operating during that period,' Ms Alger said. 'There were the rules that were on the books, and then there were the rules that were market-wide practice, and what a lot of people realized was that market-wide practice wasn't always legal.' Post-2008 crisis, Alger said she believed that real-life CEO's like that of Carter Darling seemed to be under more scrutiny, and hoped that any increased attention would provide a check on power, along with better regulation and increased market transparency.","Cristina Alger's new book The Darlings tells the tale of a hedge fund's downfall .

"By . Kerry Mcqueeney . Last updated at 4:38 PM on 20th February 2012 . News International has revealed its new title, The Sun on Sunday, will be published for the first time this weekend. The newspaper will fill the gap in the market left by the News of the World, which closed last year as the phone-hacking scandal unfolded. And with a fresh crisis gripping The Sun following the arrest of ten current and former journalists, a defiant Rupert Murdoch has decided now is the time to launch its new stablemate. Mr Murdoch, who flew into the UK on Thursday to take personal control over the latest scandal to hit one of his titles, will be in London for the launch, an internal memo sent to all staff at News International has revealed. All smiles at The Sun: Rupert Murdoch smiles confidently as he leaves his home in Green Park and heads to The Sun's office yesterday . Speculation has begun as to who will edit the new title. This . morning Sophy Ridge, Sky News political correspondent and former News . of the World journalist, tweeted: 'I'm told by News International . sources that Dominic Mohan will be editor of The Sun on Sunday.' Mr Mohan is currently editor of The Sun. It is not known if he would edit both titles. The launch comes at a time of high tension at the paper. Journalists at the tabloid are angry . that News Corporation’s Management Standards Committee gave police . information – including the identity of sources – that led to the . arrests, which include the deputy editor, picture editor and chief . reporter. The MSC, which was formed to clean up . the company following the phone-hacking scandal, is trawling through . internal emails and passing details of suspected illegal activity to . Scotland Yard. Investigation: A detective leaves the home of Mike Sullivan, The Sun crime editor . Mr Murdoch has . moved to quell growing disquiet at The Sun by lifting the suspensions . of all arrested staff. Ten current and former senior reporters and . executives have been arrested since . November over alleged corrupt payments to public officials. It remains to be seen however whether that will be enough to rebuild trust between management and journalists. As he lifted the . suspensions, the media mogul pledged 'unwavering support' for his journalists - but . reiterated his desire to root out wrongdoing at News International. Yesterday's email revealing the launch said: 'Rupert Murdoch said . during his visit on Friday that a new Sunday title would be published . ""very soon"" - and that is a week from today. Rupert will be staying in . London to oversee the launch.' Speculation . about a Sunday edition of the biggest selling UK daily newspaper has . been mounting since the closure of the News of the World during the . hacking scandal. The email from Tom Mockridge, News . International's chief executive, acknowledged the parent company's . previous wrongdoing and said it was 'fundamentally changing'. It read: 'As you know, News . Corporation has made clear its determination to sort out what has gone . wrong in the past and we are fundamentally changing how we operate as a . business. 'The commitment of News Corporation to invest in a new edition is the strongest possible message of support we could wish for.' He told staff they would have to act quickly over the coming days. 'This is our moment,' he wrote. 'I am . sure every one of us will seize the opportunity to pull together and . deliver a great new dawn for The Sun this Sunday.' Journalists at The Sun, which is owned by News International, have said they are the victims of a 'witch-hunt' Rupert Murdoch is not under any legal obligation to hand . over to police any evidence of wrongdoing by his journalists, despite his insistence he is, a leading human . rights lawyer has said. The News International boss used a letter to staff . explaining his actions relating to the arrest of a number of Sun journalists. Murdoch told staff that the Management Standards Committee, . which has given up evidence that has led to the arrest of nine Sun journalists . in the past month, would continue to disclose material to the police because . the company was 'obligated' to do so. But Geoffrey Robertson QC (pictured) has said that Murdoch's letter 'is . full of errors, both of law and history'. He told the Guardian that the media baron was 'ill-advisedly . and unethically throwing away the shield that parliament gave to journalists in . 1984 so they could protect their sources'. Murdoch's email to staff said: 'We will turn over every . piece of evidence we find – not just because we are obligated to but because it . is the right thing to do,'. He added that he would 'continue to ensure that all . appropriate steps are taken to protect legitimate journalistic privilege and . sources' but warned he 'cannot protect people who have paid public officials'. Robertson said: 'Apparently, he thinks it is right to hand . over confidential source material – including the names of whistleblowers – to . police without them even asking. 'This is a breach of the most fundamental ethic that . journalists must not betray their source and there is no law that requires it. 'On the contrary, the 1984 Police and Criminal Evidence Act . defines confidential journalistic material as “excluded material”, which police . cannot seize at all, other than in a few cases such as official secrets, when . they have to get an order from a circuit judge.' David Wooding, the former political editor of the News of the World, who is now associate editor at The Sun, told Sky News: 'It caught me by surprise. 'Mr Murdoch came round the editorial floor on Friday and said he was launching it very soon. 'We heard rumours of a date in April. This evening, astonishingly, we are told it's going to happen next week.' He added: 'We don't even know what the staffing levels will be at this stage. 'I'm . told there will be extra staff taken on but this is not the News of the . World in another guise, this is The Sun publishing on another day.' Dominic Mohan, the editor of The Sun, described it as a 'truly historic moment' in newspaper publishing. He said: 'Our readers' reaction to the announcement of a seventh-day Sun has been huge and we won't let them down.' It is believed that there will be a . senior role at the new title for Victoria Newton, the former News of the . World deputy editor, and current editor of the Saturday edition of The . Sun. While Sophy Ridge . added on Twitter: 'I'm told there will be ""some sharing"" of Sun staff . across the daily & sunday editions. This will have big implications . for the industry.' Staff have accused the company of a . ‘witch-hunt’ after the Management Standards Committee passed information . to police that led to the journalists' arrests. But he warned: 'We will obey the law. Illegal activities simply cannot and will not be tolerated – at any of our publications.' In an email, the 80-year-old News . Corporation chairman said recent events were 'a source of great pain for . me, as I know it is for each of you'. 'I’ve worked alongside you for 43 . years to build The Sun into one of the world’s finest papers. It is part . of me and is one of our proudest achievements,' he said. The Metropolitan Police has arrested and bailed the ten Sun journalists. All were immediately suspended on full . pay in the wake of the arrests. But Mr Murdoch said he was doing . 'everything to assist' them, including paying their legal fees. He said they were free to work until any formal charges are made against them. Despite the invitation, it was not clear if all ten journalists - many of whom were arrested in raids on their homes - would return to work after it was reported that some were considering their options. News International journalists fear further arrests. The heavy-handed police tactics have drawn strong criticism, with the Yard accused of diverting officers from murder, rape and terrorism investigations to join ‘Stasi-like’ raids against journalists. Mr Murdoch, who dramatically closed down the News of the World last July at the height of the phone-hacking scandal, insisted journalists’ ‘legitimate’ confidential sources would be protected. But he wrote: ‘We will turn over every piece of evidence we find – not just because we are obligated to but because it is the right thing to do. ‘I made a commitment last summer that I would do everything I could to get to the bottom of our problems and make this company an example to Fleet Street of ethical journalism.’ Despite Mr Murdoch's charm offensive, many were still furious about the treatment of their colleagues at the hands of the MSC. In a sign of how low relations have sunk, one senior staff member dubbed former editor of the Daily Telegraph Will Lewis, an MSC member, the 'chief witch hunter' and said there would be demands that he be sacked. Rupert Murdoch touched down at Luton Airport in a private jet before being driven to his London home . Sources close to the investigation believe they have uncovered evidence of 'serious suspected criminality over a sustained period' by some public officials supplying The Sun with information, dismissing the suggestion from some reporters that they were being investigated over 'trivial' matters, such as £50 lunches with sources. The MSC has been feeding Operation Elveden, the police investigation into corrupt payments, with information over the past few months. In all, 21 people have been held. The five members of Sun staff arrested last weekend were deputy editor of the paper Geoff Webster, chief reporter John Kay, picture editor John Edwards, deputy news editor John Sturgis and chief foreign correspondent Nick Parker. Also held in the dawn raids were a 39-year-old Ministry of Defence employee and a 36-year-old member of the Armed Forces. In January, senior members of The Sun's newsroom were held by police and later released on bail. They were head of news Chris Pharo, executive editor Fergus Shanahan, crime editor Mike Sullivan as well as former managing editor Graham Dudman and a 29-year-old police officer. In July last year, former chief executive of News International and ex-Sun editor Rebekah Brooks was questioned by detectives as part of Operation Elveden and those involved with Operation Weeting, the investigation into alleged phone hacking by journalists. In November, long-serving journalist Jamie Pyatt was also arrested in relation to allegations of corrupt payments to police officers.","News comes in the wake of fresh scandal surrounding Sun journalists .

"By . Anthony Bond . Last updated at 2:17 PM on 20th February 2012 . Difficult times: Increasing numbers of teenagers and younger children are seeking sex-changing treatments because they feel certain they were born in the wrong bodies . Increasing numbers of teenagers and younger children are seeking sex-changing treatments, doctors have revealed today. Although switching gender roles and . occasionally pretending to be the opposite sex is common in young . children, doctors say they are seeing increasing cases of youngsters who feel certain they were born . with the wrong bodies. Some . are labeled with 'gender identity disorder,' a psychiatric diagnosis. But emerging research suggests the children may have brain differences more similar to the . opposite sex. Dr. Norman Spack, author of one of three . reports published today in the medical journal Pediatrics, said by some estimates, 1 in 10,000 children have the condition. Dr Spack, who is a director of one of America's first . gender identity medical clinics, at Children's Hospital Boston, said pediatricians need to know these children . exist and deserve treatment. 'If you open the doors, these are the kids who come. They're out there. They're in your practices,' he said in an interview. The issue raises ethical questions, and some experts urge caution in treating children with puberty-blocking drugs and hormones. An eight-year-old in Los Angeles is a typical patient. Born a girl, the child announced at 18 months, 'I a boy' and has stuck with that belief. The family was shocked but now refers to the child as a boy and is watching for the first signs of puberty to begin treatment, his mother told The Associated Press. Offering sex-changing treatment to kids younger than 18 raises ethical concerns, and their parents' motives need to be closely examined, said Dr. Margaret Moon, a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics' bioethics committee. Warning: Dr Norman Spack, pictured, says . withholding sex-change treatment to children can be harmful and lead to self-mutilation . Some kids may get a psychiatric diagnosis when they are just hugely uncomfortable with narrowly defined gender roles; or some may be gay and are coerced into treatment by parents more comfortable with a sex change than having a homosexual child, said Dr Moon, who teaches at the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics. It's harmful 'to have an irreversible treatment too early,' Dr Moon said. Doctors who provide the treatment say withholding it would be more harmful. These children sometimes resort to self-mutilation to try to change their anatomy; the other two journal reports note that some face verbal and physical abuse and are prone to stress, depression and suicide attempts. Dr Spack said those problems typically disappear in kids who've had treatment and are allowed to live as the opposite sex. Guidelines from the Endocrine Society endorse transgender hormone treatment but say it should not be given before puberty begins. At that point, the guidelines recommend puberty-blocking drugs until age 16, then lifelong sex-changing hormones with monitoring for potential health risks. Mental health professionals should be involved in the process, the guidelines say. The group's members are doctors who treat hormonal conditions. Modern: Children's Hospital Boston has one of America's first gender identity medical clinics . Those guidelines, along with YouTube videos by sex-changing teens and other media attention, have helped raise awareness about treatment and led more families to seek help, Dr Spack said. His report details a fourfold increase in patients at the Boston hospital. His Gender Management Service clinic, which opened at the hospital in 2007, averages about 19 patients each year, compared with about four per year treated for gender issues at the hospital in the late 1990s. The report details 97 girls and boys treated between 1998 and 2010; the youngest was 4 years old. Kids that young and their families get psychological counseling and are monitored until the first signs of puberty emerge, usually around age 11 or 12. Then children are given puberty-blocking drugs, in monthly $1,000 injections or implants imbedded in the arm. In another Pediatrics report, a Texas doctor says he's also provided sex-changing treatment to an increasing number of children; so has a clinic at Children's Hospital Los Angeles where the 8-year-old is a patient. Need to be careful: Dr. Margaret Moon says offering sex-changing treatment to children younger than 18 raises ethical concerns and their parents' motives need to be closely examined . The drugs used by the clinics are approved for delaying puberty in kids who start maturing too soon. The drugs' effects are reversible and Dr Spack said they've caused no complications in his patients. The idea is to give these children time to mature emotionally and make sure they want to proceed with a permanent sex change. Only one of the 97 opted out of permanent treatment, Dr Spack said. Kids will more easily pass as the opposite gender, and require less drastic treatment later, if drug treatment starts early, Dr Spack said. For example, boys switching to girls will develop breasts and girls transitioning to boys will be flat-chested if puberty is blocked and sex-hormones started soon enough. The mother of the Los Angeles 8-year-old says he's eager to begin treatment. When the child was told he could get shots to block breast development, 'he was so excited,' the mother said. He also knows he'll eventually be taking testosterone shots for life but surgery right now is uncertain. The child attends a public school where classmates don't know he is biologically a girl. For that reason, his mother requested anonymity. She said she explained about having a girl's anatomy but he rejected that, refused to wear dresses, and has insisted on using a boy's name since pre-school.

John Fairfax, the first person to cross the Atlantic Ocean alone in a rowing boat, has died at the age of 74 after a lifetime of exploits and adventure. The self-professed 'professional adventurer' died on February 8 of an apparent heart attack at his Las Vegas home, his wife Tiffany, said yesterday. Fairfax, who was British, gained international attention in 1969 when he became the first person in recorded history to cross the Atlantic alone in a rowboat. He dealt with sharks, storms and exhaustion on the six-month, 5,000-mile journey from the Canary Islands to Florida. A life on the high seas: John Fairfax stands beside his 22-foot rowing boat, Britannia, at King George V Dock in London, prior to sailing to the Canary Islands from where he rowed to Miami. He died aged 74 last week . In 1972, he and his then girlfriend Sylvia Cook became the first known people to row across the Pacific Ocean. He survived a shark attack and cyclone on the year-long, 8,000-mile trek from San Francisco to Australia. Fairfax wrote separate books about his ocean crossings that were both published in the 1970s. His wife said: 'He was a man of unbelievable strength and courage and confidence in everything he did. He thought nature was a worthy challenge, and he loved nature.' John Fairfax used two different custom-made boats on the ocean journeys and looked to the stars to help him navigate. Captain's rest: Swimmers met John Fairfax and his 22-foot rowboat when he finally reached the shore in Florida in 1969 after six months at sea . He survived by eating up to eight pounds of fish a day and had a system to convert ocean water into drinking water. Mrs Fairfax said: 'On the Pacific, a shark took a big chunk of his arm out when he was spearing fish. There you are on the Pacific Ocean and there's no hospital, and you need to row. He was an amazing, amazing human being.' He believed a human could accomplish . anything if they had confidence. When he would get an idea in mind, he . would pursue it and say, 'I can do it.' John Fairfax enjoyed many other adventures, including time living in the Amazon jungle when he was 13 and a stint as a pirate. He also spoke five languages, was a talented chef and regularly played the card game baccarat at Las Vegas casinos, his wife said. She added: 'He believed a human could accomplish anything if they had confidence. When he would get an idea in mind, he would pursue it and say, ''I can do it.''' Ms Cook, 73, who lives near London, remained lifelong friends with Mr Fairfax. She told the New York Times after his death: 'He's always been a gambler. He was going to the casino every night when I met him - it was craps in those days. And at the end of the day, adventures are a kind of gamble, aren't they?' His only immediate survivor is his wife of 31 years, who moved with him to Las Vegas in 1992 after a hurricane in Florida where they had lived. No public services were planned.","Made the six-month, 5,000-mile journey from the Canary Islands to Florida .

Two men tied up a woman guard at the Museum of the History of the Olympic Games in Olympia and escaped with 68 bronze and pottery pieces. The guard was the only one on duty, union officials said, because of job cuts caused by Greece’s crippling debt crisis. Scroll down for video . A bronze mask and a pottery discus thrower which were taken from the Olympia museum . Prized possession: Terracotta jugs which are among the antiquities housed in the Olympia museum . It was the second major robbery from a . leading Greek museum within a few weeks. Last month thieves took . pictures by Picasso and Mondrian from the National Gallery in Athens. The Olympia museum, which houses . works from the second millennium BC to the fifth century AD, is due to . stage the historic ceremony of lighting the Olympic flame at the . beginning of its journey to London on May 10. The thieves are reported to have entered at 7.30am local time and ordered the guard to hand over various objects. When she refused, she was tied up and gagged.

Trips of a lifetime for thousands of holidaymakers have been wrecked after the collapse of an international budget airline. At least 4,000 passengers are stranded and sleeping on airport floors because Air Australia has run out of money and went into voluntary administration today, immediately grounding its five-jet fleet. Some of those affected are stuck as far away as Honolulu, Hawaii, and Phuket in Thailand. The Brisbane-based international and domestic airline, formerly known as Strategic Airlines, said all flights had been cancelled and the airline would not be accepting new bookings because it could no longer pay its bills. Bust: Air Australia has run out of money and immediately grounded its fleet . Air Australia's fleet consists of five Airbus A330-200 and A320-200 aircraft, and regularly flies to Bali, Phuket, Honolulu and cities within Australia. 'It currently appears that there are no funds available to meet operational expenses so flights will be suspended immediately,' the airline said in a statement. Passengers who bought tickets with credit cards or had travel insurance may be given a refund, the airline said. Nowhere to go: Passengers sleep with their luggage at Phuket international airport after their flight home from Thailand was cancelled . Stranded: Passengers pass the time at the Phuket airport today as they have no way yet of getting home . Calling home: Friends pass the time in Phuket with no real prospect of returning to Australia anytime soon . Family: A mother and her children stranded in Phuket today . Around 4,000 passengers were overseas with Air Australia round-trip tickets, voluntary administrator Mark Korda said. 'Overnight, the company was unable to refuel its planes in Phuket,' Korda told Australia's Fairfax Radio. 'The directors appointed us at 1:30 this morning and the boys have been working throughout the night to deal with what's a very difficult situation.'

Travel ban: Cheryl Carter, personal assistant to former NI chief executive Rebekah Brooks, has been forced to surrender her passport . Rebekah Brooks' personal assistant was planning to emigrate to Australia just days before she was arrested in the News Of The World phone hacking scandal, it has emerged. Cheryl Carter, 47, had her passport confiscated by officers . from Scotland Yard's Operation Weeting team, set up to investigate . allegations of phone hacking at the newspaper, where Ms Brooks . was a former editor. The . arrest, on suspicion of attempting to pervert the course of justice, means that Mrs Carter has been separated from her husband and two . children, who have had to fly to Australia without her to meet strict . visa requirements. As Ms . Brooks' personal assistant for 19 years, police believe Mrs Carter has an . 'intimate knowledge' of the former chief executive's day-to-day . arrangements. Mrs Carter . would have had to keep business diaries and personal schedules as Ms . Brooks rose through the News International ranks, From News Of The World . editor to Sun editor, and finally to NI chief executive. Police hope Mrs Carter, who denies any wrongdoing, can shed more light onto the . hacking investigation, and felt it necessary to arrest her and restrict . her movement for further questioning. In stark contrast, no such restrictions are currently placed on Ms Brooks, who enjoyed a New Year sunshine break in Cape Town, South Africa, with her husband Charlie. Though arrested on July 15 last year, like many News International executives Ms Brooks was allowed to attend a police station by appointment to be questioned. She is bailed to return for questioning by police in March. Her lawyer has said she denies committing any criminal offence. Sunshine break: Rebekah Brooks and her husband Charlie flew to South Africa to spend New Year's Eve there . Relaxed and happy: Despite the growing phone hacking scandal, Ms Brooks and her husband smiled as they posed for photos on their holiday . Ms Brooks also became a mother to a baby girl Scarlett, born via a surrogate at the end of January. It is unclear how long Mrs Carter will be separated from her own children. She was arrested on January 6 at her home in Billericay, Essex, during a dawn raid by Operation Weeting officers. Detectives are understood to be . investigating allegations that emails were destroyed at the company . before evidence was handed over to the Metropolitan Police. Proud mother: Brooks with baby Scarlett, born via a surrogate mother on January 25. Mrs Carter's arrest means she has been separated from her two children . Mrs Carter is a partner in a cosmetics . business with former model and celebrity make-up artist Sue Moxley, and . has also offered beauty tips on website Thinkingslimmer.com. It is understood she left NI shortly . after Ms Brooks resigned from the company and was planning to relocate to . Australia at the end of January to take up employment at News Limited, . the Australian arm of Rupert Murdoch's News International. While sources at NI told The . Independent newspaper that Mrs Carter's move Down Under had been planned . for some time, other colleagues reportedly expressed surprise - not only at the move but how . Mrs Carter and her family were able to obtain Australian visas. One was quoted in the paper as saying: . 'It's quite difficult to get to Australia and Cheryl is a make-up . expert - she doesn't exactly have expert skills.' Operation Weeting is running in . parallel with Operation Elveden, into alleged bribery of public . officials. A string of senior journalists at The Sun newspaper have been . arrested in connection with the Elveden investigation. Phone-hacking . detectives working their way through 300 million emails from NI have . arrested a series of high-profile figures, including ex-Downing Street . communications chief Andy Coulson. Some . 1,800 people have come forward to express fears that they may have been . hacked but the final total of people whose phones were hacked by the . News of the World will be about 800, the force believes. The . scandal has already led to the closure of the Sunday tabloid after 168 . years, prompted a major public inquiry, and forced the resignation of .

The News International Staff Association wants an urgent meeting with News Corp boss Rupert Murdoch over the role played by an internal committee into the arrests of ten journalists at The Sun newspaper. The association, representing NI staff, has discovered that the Management and Standards Committee (MSC)  - set up by News Corp - gave information to the police about News Corp staff. One claim, denied by the MSC, is that it is passing details of expenses claims - specifically lunch or drinks claims with contacts. NI staff - including those at newspapers The Sun, The Times and the Sunday Times - are concerned the MSC is compromising the anonymity of their sources and contacts. But a spokeman for the MSC told The Guardian: 'The information handed to the police is relating to unlawful material. The information is redacted to ensure that lawful journalistic inquiries are not threatened.'","Cheryl Carter denied travel and separated from her family after arrest over phone hacking scandal .

Jason Lees, 40, threw his two-year-old son from Brisbane's 243ft-high Story Bridge, then jumped to his own death, landing in parkland on the banks of the Brisbane River. Mr Lees taught at the Anglican Church Grammar School in the city and was also an International Seven's Rugby Union referee. Horrific: Jason Lees, left, threw his two-year son, right, off the Story Bridge in Brisbane in the early hours of this morning before jumping to his own death .

'The impact this sudden news has had on our community is significant and . as we work through our grief we are concerned for our boys whom he . taught in the classroom or coached on the sports field,' he told the Port Stephens Examiner. Queensland police said Mr Lees rode a bicycle onto the footpath on one side of the bridge in the early hours of this morning before throwing his baby over a safety rail. Tragedy: Brisbane's Story Bridge from which Jason Lees threw his child before jumping himself . Then he climbed over the rail and jumped. The tragedy is similar to an incident in . 2009 when 37-year-old Arthur Freeman tossed his four-year-old daughter .

A witness who saw the incident, at around 3.30am, called police who rushed to the scene but there was nothing they could do for Mr Lees or the child. It is believed that Mr Lees is originally from Canada. Police said they did not believe the child was the subject of a custody battle, unlike the child in the Melbourne tragedy. Talented: Jason Lees was an International Seven's Rugby Union referee .

"By . Wil Longbottom . Last updated at 5:55 PM on 21st December 2011 . Aggression: Lord West has called for Britain to send a nuclear submarine to the Falkland Islands to signal the intention to defend the territory if Argentina attempts another invasion . A former head of the British Navy has said 'aggressive' demands by Argentina over the Falkland Islands should be countered by sending a nuclear submarine to the region. Lord West has also suggested staging a exercise demonstrating Britain's ability to reinforce the South Atlantic islands would leave Buenos Aires in no doubt the country would defend them in case of conflict. The peer slammed a new agreement by Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay to ban ships that fly the Falklands flag from their ports as 'outrageous'. Speaking to London's Evening Standard, he said: 'They are basically becoming more and more aggressive. I find that worrying. 'Far . from trying to settle in a grown-up way and having better and better . relations with the Falkland islanders, they are upping the ante and . becoming confrontational.' He . added that he did not believe Argentina would launch another invasion, . but that sending a nuclear submarine to 'stick its mast up' as it . patrolled the area would signal Britain's intent. The former First Sea . Lord, who commanded HMS Ardent on which 22 crew were killed during the . Falklands War in 1982, added: 'When one is there, we should make a point . of making it clear that it is there.' The . Foreign Office has condemned the decision to ban vessels flying the . Falklands flag from entering ports in the three countries. A spokesman said: 'We are very . concerned by the latest Argentine attempt to isolate the Falkland . Islands people and damage their livelihoods, for which there is no . justification. 'No one should doubt our determination to protect the Falkland islanders' right to determine their own political future.' Tensions were already high in the . region after Argentina intensified its campaign of intimidation against . fishing boats operating with UK licences. Deterrent? Nuclear submarine HMS Trafalgar taking part in an exercise. Lord West has said sending one to the Falkland Island would tell Argentina Britain was serious about its defence . Dispute: The Falkland Islands is home to 3,000 people and was ceded to Britain in 1833 . Tensions: Uruguay President Jose Mujia and Argentinian counterpart Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner at the Mercosur summit in Montevideo. The bloc announces ships with Falkland Islands flags would be banned from its ports . In . the latest breach of international law earlier this month, Spanish . vessels bound for the islands were intercepted and boarded by troops. Today . Uruguayan president Jose Mujica said at a summit for the Mercosur . trading block - which also includes landlocked Paraguay - in the capital . Montevideo that solidarity among South America's neighbours was key to . his country's foreign policy. He said: 'For the moment, this means accepting that this territory is a colonial British position in our America.' Bloodshed: An Argentine war cemetery near Darwin, Falklands. The 1982 conflict saw more than 900 people killed before the invading South American country surrendered . Mr Mujica said British-flagged civilian ships that may supply the islands would be allowed to use its ports, but not military vessels. The decision by the countries is the latest in a series by Latin American authorities designed to show solidarity with Argentina, which calls the islands Las Malvinas. Roger Spink, president of the Falklands Chamber of Commerce, said they were a small community and felt increasingly under blockade. He told the BBC: 'If we were Palestine, the European Union would be up in arms.' The dispute has created a fresh diplomatic headache for Britain. Invasion: The Argentinian cruiser General Belgrano sinks after being hit by a torpedo as its crew takes to life rats in the South Atlantic Ocean . Last week Uruguay said it was banning ships flying the Falkland Islands flag from its ports, prompting the Foreign Office to call on Uruguay's ambassador in London to explain the move. The government in Buenos Aires has stepped up its official policy of blockading the British territory by ordering its navy to board ships that it claims are fishing there illegally. Argentine president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner last year issued a decree requiring all vessels passing through its territorial waters to and from the Falklands to secure consent from Buenos Aires. President Kirchner secured a record election win in October as she was voted back into office with 54.1 per cent of the vote. Her nearest challenger was more than 37 per cent behind. Diplomats have played down the escalation of tensions over the Falklands as 'sabre-rattling' by President Kirchner as she campaigned for reelection, despite the islanders' wish to remain British. Resolute: Margaret Thatcher sent a task force of 100 ships to regain control of the Falklands Islands after the Argentine junta invaded . A top Argentine official hanged himself during the summit meeting of Mercosur. Ivan . Heyn, the under secretary of foreign trade and a rising star in . President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner's government, was found dead at . the Radisson Hotel in Montevideo. Ms . Kirchner was so upset on hearing the news she left a meeting of South . American leaders and had to be treated by a medical team. Argentina's . embassy confirmed Mr Heyn's death and said Uruguayan authorities were . taking 'all necessary legal steps with regard to this tragic incident'. Mr Heyn, 33, was an economist who belonged to the Peronist youth group La Campora that supports Ms Kirchner's government. A . former leader of the Argentine University Federation, he occupied other . positions in the Economy Ministry during Ms Kirchner's first term and . took up his new post just 10 days ago. But Argentina managed to secure a resolution from 32 Latin American states at a conference endorsing its claim to the islands, which were ceded to Britain in 1833. The row began to escalate in January last year when oil exploration rigs arrived off the islands. Rockhopper Exploration, which carried out test drilling in the waters around the islands, said in September it had made significant finds and could begin pumping by 2016. Britain has around 1,200 service personnel on the islands, and there are three Royal Navy warships in the area along with four RAF Typhoon fighter bombers. In 1982, Argentina's junta invaded the islands. Then prime minister Margaret Thatcher sent a task force including aircraft carriers equipped with Harrier jump jets and an invasion force to retake the territory. A 74-day war claimed the lives of 649 Argentines and 255 Britons as the Falklands were successfully defended. Concerns have been raised, however, that defence cuts this year could leave the territory vulnerable to another attack by Argentina. Former military chiefs said in September the dwindling budget left the islands 'ripe for picking' if Buenos Aires invaded with support from its allies. The United Kingdom National Defence Association report urged ministers to boost military spending from 2 to 3 per cent of GDP, and warned Britain would struggle to repel Argentine forces if they were supported by China, for example. It said: 'Once lost, the islands would be very difficult to retake, particularly with no air cover over a task force. 'Our assessment is that current force levels are inadequate to hold off even a small-size invasion.'","Lord West calls for British nuclear submarine to 'stick its mast up' off coast of Argentina to signal intention to defend islands .

"By . Jack Doyle . Last updated at 10:36 AM on 21st February 2012 . Britain's shambolic Border Agency has routinely dropped or downgraded major immigration controls for the past five years without ministerial approval, a devastating report revealed last night. It found up to half a million Eurostar passengers arriving from French tourist resorts, including Disneyland Paris, were waved into Britain without facing any anti-terror checks. The European nationals were not examined against the Home Office’s so-called Warnings Index, which contains details of terrorists and dangerous criminals who must be refused entry to keep the public safe. Concerns: Home Secretary Theresa May has revealed how security checks at Britain's borders have been routinely suspended, including on an occasion when Immigration Minister Damian Green authorised the downgrading . The report also showed how millions of pounds was wasted on schemes which did not work, with ministers being regularly fed misleading information by  civil servants. Foreign students were let in if they ‘appeared to be genuine’. Last night, as Home Secretary Theresa May announced that she is to split the dysfunctional agency into two, a terrifying culture of arrogance and incompetence emerged. The report, which was ordered after last  year’s revelations that senior civil servants were abandoning passport checks, provoked fury, with MPs criticising Britain’s ‘Mickey Mouse’ immigration controls. Yesterday’s report also revealed how: . The report, by John Vine, chief inspector of the UK Border Agency, was commissioned last year following the so-called ‘Brodiegate’ scandal. Taking liberties: The official investigation into the relaxation of border checks last year found staff went 'over and beyond' any scheme approved by ministers . It saw former chief Brodie Clark resign after the Home Secretary accused him of weakening controls without her permission. Yesterday’s report appeared to clear ministers of downgrading checks, saying that border staff went ‘beyond’ what was approved. As the chief constable of Wiltshire Police, Brian Moore guided it to its current status as the safest in England and Wales. He will leave the post to set up the UK Border Force, a new Government agency tasked with policing arrivals in Britain. Christopher Hoare, chair of Wiltshire . Police Authority said: 'We are supporting this secondment of Brian Moore . to the UK Border Force where he will be engaged in work of national . importance. 'We . are sure he will make an invaluable contribution, and felt that his . skills and experience should be made available in the national interest. 'Brian . became Wiltshire's Chief Constable in January 2008 and under his . leadership Wiltshire has become the safest county in England and Wales. 'We know he will be greatly missed by the public, Wiltshire Police and our partners. 'WPA recognises, and is very grateful for, Brian's outstanding contribution to the policing of Wiltshire and Swindon.' Deputy . Chief Constable Patrick Geenty will take over from Mr Moore until a new . chief constable is appointed, which will not be until November at the . earliest. The WPA said the new appointment would be a priority once a new commissioner had been sworn in on November 22. However, it revealed Immigration Minister Damian Green did  authorise the downgrading of checks early last year. Mrs May later made clear her opposition but this instruction was ignored. In her statement to MPs yesterday, she said that from next month the Border Force – the part of the UKBA responsible for checking those trying to enter the country – will be hived off. Wiltshire Police chief constable Brian Moore will replace Mr Clark and will be ‘directly accountable’ to ministers, Mrs May said. The remaining part of UKBA will be responsible for processing immigration applications. Mrs May told MPs: ‘The Vine report reveals a border force that suspended important checks  without permission; that spent  millions on new technologies but chose not to use them; that was led by managers who did not communicate with their staff; and that sent reports to ministers that were inaccurate, unbalanced and excluded key information.’ Tory MP Douglas Carswell said: ‘This just shows that the UK Border Agency is a real Mickey Mouse operation. Unfortunately it is neither entertaining nor funny. It is run by clowns for their own advantage and convenience.’ The report revealed that since 2007, passengers on trains arriving from Avignon, Bourg St Maurice and Disneyland station Marne-la-Vallee had their passports examined but no more detailed checks were carried out. Separately, Warnings Index checks were abandoned more than 350 times, mostly at  so-called ‘juxtaposed controls’ – immigration posts in France. Agency records suggest the checks were abandoned for up to six hours at Calais, when staff were faced with traffic jams at the port and justified the suspension on ‘health and safety grounds’. The students scheme – codenamed Operation Savant – operated during the peak rush of new arrivals from September last year. It allowed Heathrow officials to let in students from ‘low risk’  countries if they ‘otherwise appeared to be genuine students’. Mr Vine said the policy was ‘potentially unlawful’. The report stated: ‘We cannot say whether  any student was admitted into the UK unlawfully under this initiative and any potential risks to security cannot be quantified.’ Chip reading facilities were ‘deactivated’ nearly 15,000 times at ten ports between January and June last year, Mr Vine said. Astonishingly, the Border Agency was ‘unable to explain definitively why these deactivations occurred’. Yesterday’s final, terminal blow for UKBA follows a string of scandals for the immigration system going back years. In 2006, then home secretary John Reid branded the immigration  system ‘not fit for purpose’. The criticism was repeated by MPs on the Home Affairs Committee in a report two years ago. Mr Clark resigned in November last year claiming constructive  dismissal. He is likely to receive a substantial payoff despite yesterday’s report and a similar internal inquiry finding against him. Lax: 500,000 Eurostar passengers boarded . trains in France and arrived in the UK without being checked against the . warnings index of suspected terrorists and those with adverse . immigration histories . JAMES SLACK: . Lord knows how many maniacs, having learned of this gaping hole in our already porous borders - and they do learn very quickly - piled in. Read more here . The internal review by former police officer David Wood found Mr Clark took the action he did because he wanted ‘quick wins’ to cut queues at airports. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper last night accused Mrs May of ‘passing the buck’. ‘It is clear that on Theresa May’s watch border controls were substantially weakened last summer compared to previous years,’ she added. Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said  yesterday: ‘The Home Secretary’s proposals do not go far enough. ‘A separate border force will allow a more focused view on what is happening. However, there is a danger in assuming that structural changes will solve these problems. ‘What is needed is root and branch reform, not changing faces but cultures. This is day one for the future of UKBA. The Home Secretary should abandon her Chihuahua approach and become a pit bull. Otherwise her failures will come back to bite her.’ 2006 - The then Home Secretary John, now Lord, Reid, describes the immigration system as 'not fit for purpose' with 'inadequate' leadership . 2008 - The UK Border Agency (UKBA) is set up in response to Lord Reid's remarks . 2009 - A report by the National Audit Office highlights a lack of detention space to support the asylum process .

A two-year-old suffered an agonising death after drinking toxic liquid his mother was using to help grow cannabis in his bedroom, a court heard yesterday. Aaron Booth had not eaten all morning and went hunting for food and drink at lunchtime because his mother was still in bed with her boyfriend, the court was told. He probably mistook the bottle for a children’s fruit drink. Lauren Booth (right), pictured at Bradford Crown Court, is accused of assault, ill treatment or neglect of a young person following the death of her two-year-old son Aaron (left) The container of PH Up had been left . on a windowsill within easy reach of the inquisitive toddler in the . cannabis farm that his mother had set up to make money, it was alleged. Lauren Booth, 24, was woken by a bang . and found her son had collapsed, was gasping for breath, with brown . lips and clearly in pain, Bradford Crown Court heard. He was rushed to hospital and underwent emergency surgery to remove his stomach and part of his oesophagus. But his windpipe had also been burned . away by the potassium hydroxide chemical and the internal injuries were . so bad that nothing could be done. Doctors withdrew treatment and he died on November 17,  11 days after the accident. Tragic toddler Aaron Booth died after drinking . toxic plant food meant to help his mother Lauren's cannabis grow, . thinking it was a Fruit Shoot drink (right). Pictured left is a stock . image of a cannabis plant . Yesterday Booth, of Huddersfield, . denied wilfully assaulting, ill-treating, neglecting or abandoning her . son in a manner likely to cause him unnecessary suffering or injury. PH Up is used in the soil-free . cultivation of plants, and drinking just two teaspoons of the corrosive . substance would be fatal. The bottle had a child-proof top and . contained the warning: ‘Causes burns. Keep locked up and out of reach of . children.’ Prosecutor Tom Storey said: ‘It is a clear liquid in a . small, blue, plastic bottle. To a young child it looks similar to a . Fruit Shoot squash drink.’ Jobless Booth was in bed with her boyfriend, Shaun Williams, at 12.45pm on November 6 last year when the tragedy happened. Mr Storey told the jury: ‘She had . failed to get up and failed to provide Aaron with food and drink, and by . midday he must have been very hungry and thirsty. The home of Lauren Booth, in Huddersfield, where toddler Aaron drank from a bottle of plant food . ‘He got hold of this bottle as he . searched for something to eat and drink when left to his own devices – . she preferred to stay in bed.’ The mother woke up to find Aaron . collapsed beside her bed. The court heard that Williams and Booth, with Aaron in her arms, ran to a neighbour’s house to raise the alarm. He was taken to the local general . hospital and transferred for specialist treatment at Leeds General . Infirmary, but the internal injuries were too serious. Mohammad Khan, the child’s father, told officers he had smelled cannabis on access visits to the house. Booth had told him she and Williams had been trying to make money by growing ‘skunk’. She seemed ‘annoyed’ that social . services and police were involved, stating she was ‘going to have to . find somewhere else’ to grow the cannabis, the court heard. A laptop was seized on which a file had been downloaded called ‘Cannabis Big Book of Buds’. Mr Storey said police found a . cluttered house, but Aaron’s room was ‘curiously empty’, with black . curtains and an open window on a cold November night. The trial continues.","Aaron Booth died 11 days after drinking the toxic liquid .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 7:42 AM on 22nd February 2012 . The White House is apologizing for US soldiers burning of Muslim holy books in a pile of garbage at an American military base in Afghanistan. Press secretary Jay Carney said it was a 'deeply unfortunate incident' and doesn't reflect the respect the US military has for the religious practices of the Afghan people. More than 2,000 furious Afghans - . some chanting ‘die, die foreigners’, other throwing rocks - gathered . outside the giant US air base at Bagram, 40 miles north of the capital . Kabul, as reports of the burning spreads. Military sources told the Associated Press that books were removed from the library of a nearby detention center because they contained extremist messages. Prisoners had been writing in the books as way of communicating. Plumes: Thick black smoke provides cover for a group of young stone-throwing demonstrators . Rocks and stones: Afghan youths throw whatever they can lay their hands over the walls of the base . Anger: Afghan youth throw stones toward at soldiers shouting 'Allahu akbar, Allahu akbar' Carney echoed military officials Tuesday in saying that the Quran burning at Bagram Air Field happened unintentionally, and that an investigation was being undertaken to understand why it did and ensure it didn't happen again. He said the administration was following the matter closely. The US commander of Nato troops in Afghanistan, General John Allen, was forced to apologise over the claims that foreign troops had ‘improperly disposed’ of copies of the Koran. But there were immediate fears the Taliban and other insurgent groups would try to exploit the claims, using it as a rallying call against US, British and fellow Coalition forces. The protests come as the FBI announced it has removed hundreds of pages of training documents that painted inaccurate or stereotypical views of Islam. The counter-terrorism training materials referred to the Prophet Muhammad, the founder of Islam, as a cult leader and included graphs that implied devout Muslims got more violent throughout history, while Jews and Christians became less violent. Rudimentary: An Afghan uses a slingshot to hurl stones towards the airbase . FBI Director Robert Mueller announced the review after Wired Magazine posted copies of some of the offending documents online. The FBI says, the documents tossed out in the months-long ininvestigation represent less than 1 percent of the bureau's training materials. Meanwhile, New York City's mayor faced off with the president of Yale University on Monday over efforts by the city's police department to monitor Muslim student groups. The Associated Press revealed over the weekend that in recent years, the NYPD has kept close watch on Muslim student associations across the Northeast. Defiant: An Afghan shows a copy of the holy Koran that was allegedly burnt by U.S. soldiers . Burned: Protesters show copies of the burnt Korans . The effort that included daily tracking of student websites and blogs, monitoring who was speaking to the groups, and in one case sending an undercover officer on a whitewater rafting trip with students from the City College of New York. Yale President Richard Levin was among a number of academics who condemned the effort in a statement Monday, while Rutgers University and leaders of student Muslim groups elsewhere called for investigations into the monitoring. 'I am writing to state, in the strongest possible terms, that police surveillance based on religion, nationality, or peacefully expressed political opinions is antithetical to the values of Yale, the academic community, and the United States,' Levin wrote. Speaking to reporters later Monday, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg dismissed those criticisms as baseless. 'I don't know why keeping the country safe is antithetical to the values of Yale,' he said. He said it was 'ridiculous' to argue that there was anything wrong with officers keeping an eye on websites that are available to the general public.","Muslim holy books with extremist messages in them were 'improperly disposed of' by soldiers .

Kick off your shoes and get out the surfboards... because Britain could be hotter than Hawaii on Thursday with temperatures as high as 19.7C (67.4F). This would match the record for the month, set on February 13, 1988, in London, according to the Met Office.

And if Britain does break the 19.7C barrier, it will be the second . time in five months that such a record has been smashed. Last October, . Gravesend in Kent reached 29.9C. According to the Met Office, temperatures towards the end of the week are more likely to reach 17C (63C). This is still almost treble the average for this time of year, which is around 6C (43F). It would also bring the British weather to levels currently seen in Bahrain and Cairo. However, by the weekend, forecasters predict rain and lower temperatures will return.

The telescope began as a $500million project in the late 1990s, but that cost has now ballooned to over $8.8billion. Last . year Congress tried to permanently halt the project. It’s all systems . go at the moment, but it’s such a drain on Nasa’s budget that the agency . may only be able to afford one big science mission per decade from now . on, with some key projects killed off. For example, House Science Committee staff warn that a mission to bring Martian soil back to Earth may now be too expensive to carry out. On reflection: The mirrors are prepared for cryogenic testing, where they will be subjected to temperatures dipping to -415F, permitting engineers to measure in extreme detail how the shape of each mirror changes as it cools . Not only that, but Webb will sit much further out into space. Hubble is in orbit 350 miles above the Earth. Webb will gaze into the cosmos almost a million miles from Earth. The area of Webb’s mirror, meanwhile, is six and a quarter times larger than Hubble’s. The larger primary mirror the more light from objects the telescope can see.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 12:44 PM on 18th February 2012 . Iran's nuclear ambitions could plunge the world into 'a new Cold War' with the Middle East, Foreign Secretary William Hague warned today. He predicted a nuclear arms race among rival Middle Eastern states that would carry the dangers without the safety mechanisms of the old rivalry between the West and the former USSR. In an interview with The Telegraph, he insisted Britain did not back military action against the Islamic republic - as Israel is thought to be planning. He told the newspaper: ""If [the Iranians] obtain nuclear weapons capability, then I think other nations across the Middle East will want to develop nuclear weapons. Stark warning: Foreign Secretary William Hague said Iran's nuclear ambitions could trigger a 'new Cold War' that poses an even greater threat of nuclear conflict than the stand-off between the USSR and the West . 'And so the most serious round of nuclear proliferation since nuclear weapons were invented would have begun, with all the destabilising effects in the Middle East - and the threat of a new Cold War in the Middle East without necessarily all the safety mechansims. 'That would be a disaster in world affairs.' He said that Britain could be in range of Iranian nuclear weapons and that nuclear materials could fall into the hands of terrorists. However he said all options must remain on the table when dealing with President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's regime. Hidden powers? The nuclear power plant in Bushehr, southern Iran, is a major producer of electricity but the International Atomic Energy Agency fear possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear power programme. There is growing speculation among Western officials that Israel may be planning to launch military attacks against Iranian missile facilities this summer, ahead of the US presidential elections this autumn. Several Israeli diplomats have been unsuccessfully targeted by Iranian hit squads around the world in the last few days. The US has told Israel it does not want . Israel to attack Iran. However, earlier this month US defence secretary . Leon Panetta told the Washington Post that he thought the window for an . attack on Iran by Israel is between April and June. Like the bad old days but worse: Mr Hague warned of a nuclear Cold War and a new arms race in the Middle East that would pose an even greater risk than the historic stand-off between the West and the USSR, whose troops are pictured here . President Barack Obama has stressed that . he wants to allow time for new sanctions to damage Iran's ailing . economy before turning to a military approach. But other US officials believe sanctions will not work. An official knowledgeable in Middle East policy told The Guardian: 'The guys in Tehran are behaving like sanctions don't matter, like they're economy isn't collapsing, like Israel isn't going to do anything. Sanctions are all we've got to throw at the problem. If they fail then it's hard to see how we don't move to the 'in extremis' position.' In his comments to The Telegraph Mr Hague said that the British Government is 'not favouring the idea of anybody attacking Iran at the moment.' He added that they support a 'twin-track' strategy of sanctions and pressure, and negotiations on the other hand.' But he added: 'We are taking nothing off the table.'","Fears of a Middle East arms race if rogue state develops nuclear weapons .

"By . Associated Press . Last updated at 9:00 PM on 21st February 2012 . A Georgia man gunned down his co-worker's husband outside a suburban Atlanta preschool because the murder suspect believed an angel had ordered him to pull the trigger, his defence attorney argued on Tuesday. Defense attorney Doug Peters said Hemy Neuman fell so hopelessly in love with Andrea Sneiderman, whom he supervised at General Electric, that he believed he was the father of her two children and that the only way to protect them was to kill Russell Sneiderman in November 2010. Prosecutors urged the jurors . to reject the claims of delusions by Neuman, who they said will also . assert that the angel resembled Olivia Newton-John and the demon who . came to him sounded like Barry White. Insane: Hemy Neuman claims he was incapable of telling right from wrong when he shot Russell Sneiderman at close range . Visions: Neuman claimed an angel who looked like Olivia Newton-John, left, appeared to him, as did a demon with the voice of Barry White, right . He said Neuman meticulously planned the killing for months so he could be with Andrea Sneiderman. Neuman faces murder and firearms charges. 'He thought Sophia and Ian were his children and that Rusty Sneiderman was a danger to them,' said Mr Peters, adding that his client was not guilty by reason of insanity because he couldn't tell the difference between right and wrong during the killing. 'I'll boil it down to a sentence: A man wanted someone else's wife so he killed her husband,' said Don Geary, one of the prosecutors. 'He got caught. We ask you to return a verdict that speaks the truth.' Russell Sneiderman was shot to death shortly after dropping his two-year-old son off at a day care centre in Dunwoody, an affluent suburb north of Atlanta. Secret conversation: Defendant Hemy Neuman, left, spoke with attorney Douglas N. Peters in court last August . A bearded man in a hoodie approached Sneiderman, fired several shots and then hopped into a silver minivan and sped away. It happened so quickly that police initially believed it could have been a professional job. At the centre of the trial is Andrea Sneiderman, who is likely to be called to testify on Tuesday. Mr Peters said the two shared a string of 'intimate relations' during business trips after he hired her in early 2010, but that she rebuffed his attempts to marry her. Prosecutors say she rejects the allegations and that Neuman could be hallucinating. Neuman, 48, wasn't interviewed by police until six weeks after Sneiderman's death after detectives discovered that shortly before the shooting he rented a minivan matching the description of a vehicle seen driving away from the crime scene. Torn apart: Russell Sneiderman wa murdered after dropping his children off at daycare. His wife, Andrea, was allegedly having an affair with his accused killer . He faces life in prison without parole if convicted; he'd be turned over to the state mental health system if found not guilty. Neuman had a troubled childhood and was constantly in fear of his father, a Holocaust survivor who was wracked with guilt for having survived the Auschwitz death camp while 11 other relatives died. He eventually moved from his home in Mexico to a boarding school in Israel, partly to get away from his father's volatile behaviour. 'It was a life of anger, it was a life filled with terror, of not knowing when or why their father would explode with rage,' Mr Peters said. He later graduated from Georgia Tech and bought a pricey home in a Cobb County subdivision after landing a job as a high-ranking manager at GE, where he made $180,000 a year and supervised 5,000 engineers and an $800million budget, prosecutors said. Denial: Andrea Sneiderman says her husband's killer was merely a 'family friend' Neuman hired Andrea Sneiderman in early 2010 after she decided she needed to earn more money because her husband, a 36-year-old Harvard-trained entrepreneur, was having trouble finding steady work, attorneys said. They soon hit it off, and on work trips they would share long dinners, wine and occasionally romance, Neuman's defence team contends. Prosecutors say Neuman began meticulously planning Russell Sneiderman's killing after she rebuffed one of his advances. They say he bought a gun, took it to target practice and then on November  10 camped outside Sneiderman's house to try to kill him. He bolted when Sneiderman, who couldn't recognize Neuman, startled him, they say. Nine days later, prosecutors say, Neuman arrived at his office earlier than usual - at 5:36 a.m. - and then sneaked out a back door to avoid security cameras and give himself an alibi. He then drove to the Dunwoody Prep day care centre, shot Sneiderman four times and hopped in the minivan and tried to melt into morning rush traffic, they say. Neuman was so callous about his actions that he returned to work a few hours later and participated in the religious ceremonies of his victim's death, including the Jewish ritual of shovelling dirt on Sneiderman's grave at his funeral, Mr Geary said. Mr Peters asked the jurors to pay careful attention to phone records between Neuman and Andrea Sneiderman, noting that the two exchanged three calls on the night before the shooting and that she called him six times in the hours after her husband was killed. He also said his arguments that his client couldn't tell the difference between right and wrong during the killing are backed by evaluations from psychiatrists and mental health experts who diagnosed Neuman as bipolar and concluded he had a delusional disorder. 'This case is not about what happened. We know what happened,' Mr Peters said. 'It's about why.'","Hemy Neuman charged with murder of co-worker's husband Russell Sneiderman in 2010 .

American troops in Afghanistan were at the centre of new controversy and bitter protests tonight after claims US soldiers had burned copies of the Koran among rubbish. More than 2,000 furious Afghans - some chanting ‘die, die foreigners’, other throwing rocks - gathered outside the giant US air base at Bagram, 40 miles north of the capital Kabul, as reports of the burning spread. The US commander of Nato troops in Afghanistan, General John Allen, was forced to apologise over the claims that foreign troops had ‘improperly disposed’ of copies of the Koran. But there were immediate fears the Taliban and other insurgent groups would try to exploit the claims, using it as a rallying call against US, British and fellow Coalition forces. Plumes: Thick black smoke provides cover for a group of young stone-throwing demonstrators . Rocks and stones: Afghan youths throw whatever they can lay their hands over the walls of the base .

And it comes only weeks after US and . UN officials condemned a video clip of US marine snipers urinating on . dead Afghans as ‘disgusting’ and ‘inhuman.’ Announcing an immediate . investigation, Gen. Allen stressed the incident was ‘not intentional in . any way.’ However, it stoked anti-foreign sentiment that already is on . the rise after nearly a decade of war in Afghanistan and fuelled the . arguments of Afghans who believe foreign troops are not respectful of . their culture or Islamic religion. Other religious items were reported to have been among the packages burned by the two soldiers. Defiant: An Afghan shows a copy of the holy Koran that was allegedly burnt by U.S. soldiers . Burned: Protesters show copies of the burnt Korans . As word of the incident spread, . demonstrators gathered outside the sprawling Bagram Air Field, in Parwan . province. As the crowd grew, so did the outrage. U.S. helicopters fired flares to try . to break up the protests and while some demonstrators shouted their . hatred, others fired hunting guns into the air. Groups threw rocks at . the gate of the base. ‘We Afghans don’t want these . Christians and infidels, they are the enemy of our soil, our honour and . our Koran,’ said Haji Shirin, one of the protesters. ‘I urge all Muslims to sacrifice themselves in order to pull out these troops from this soil.’ Bagram also houses a prison for .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 11:07 PM on 21st February 2012 . Fans who were injured or killed at last year’s doomed Sugarland concert and the Indiana State Fair were hurt because of ‘their own fault,’ the band’s lawyers say. They said the powerful gust of wind that collapsed the stage and ultimately killed seven people and injured 58 was an ‘act of God’ and that fans accepted the risk when they attended the concert. The statement, part of a February 16 response to a civil suit filed by survivors and families of some of those killed, is a clear attempt to cast blame away from the band as investigators continue to search for answers in the collapse. Run for your lives: The stage collapses at the Indiana State Fair August 13, 2011 in Indianapolis, Indiana just before country duo Sugarland were scheduled to perform . Divine wind: Sugarland attorney James H. Milstone said the gust of wind was an 'act of God' Calling the powerful winds that toppled the stage on August 13 an 'act of God,' Sugarland's attorneys said fair officials and Mid-America Sound Corp. were responsible for the stage setup, and that the fans voluntarily assumed risk by attending the show. 'Some or all of the plaintiffs' claimed injuries resulted from their own fault,' according to the response. Sugarland attorney James H. Milstone would not elaborate Tuesday on whether that statement included those killed as well as the injured. The lawsuit response sharply contrasts comments lead singer Jennifer Nettles gave The Associated Press two days after the stage collapsed. Ms Nettles said then that she was 'moved by the grief of those families who lost loved ones. Moved by the pain of those who were injured and the fear of their families. Moved by the great heroism as I watched so many brave Indianapolis fans actually run toward the stage to try and help lift and rescue those injured. Moved by the quickness and organization of the emergency workers who set up the triage and tended to the injured.' Sugarland manager Gail Gellman issued a statement Tuesday saying Ms Nettles and Kristian Bush were upset that anyone might think they were not concerned about their fans. About face: The lawsuit response sharply contrasts comments lead singer Jennifer Nettles, right, gave two days after the collapse, saying her heart went out to the victims . 'Sadly when a tragedy occurs, people want to point fingers and try to sensationalize the disaster. The single most important thing to Sugarland are their fans. Their support and love over the past nine years has been unmatched. For anyone to think otherwise is completely devastating to them,' the statement read. Attorneys representing at least 20 law firms across Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky filed the complaint November 22 in Marion Superior Court in Indianapolis alleging breach of reasonable care to the victims. 'Sadly when a tragedy occurs, people want to point fingers and try to sensationalize the disaster. For anyone to think (that Sugarland doesn't care about their fans) is completely devastating to them.' -Sugarland manager Gail Gellman . The suit names as plaintiffs dozens of people injured and the families of some of those killed, and it seeks unspecified damages from Sugarland, producers, stage riggers and others associated with the show. Jeff Stesiak, a South Bend attorney involved in the suit, said the band's response was strange given the circumstances of the fans' injuries. 'It's unusual to put the blame on victims. The concert wasn't cancelled and they weren't told to leave. I can't imagine what the victims did to be at fault,' Mr Stesiak said Tuesday. 'They had a duty to warn fans. An open and obvious danger is more like walking along a road and seeing a downed power line and walking over it anyway. The storm wasn't like that.' Lawyers for the band are seeking a jury trial. Fatalities: Seven people died after the stage collapsed last August, and an additional 58 were injured . Scope of tragedy: A powerful gust of wind collapsed the stage and crushed people beneath it . In a January 16 deposition on a lawsuit against the company that built the stage rigging, Indiana State Fair Commission Executive Director Cindy Hoye testified that Sugarland resisted delaying the start of the concert despite threatening weather. Ms Hoye said a representative for a concert promotion company working with the fair twice approached Sugarland about the fair's desire to delay the show. But Ms Hoye said the band expressed concerns about how a delay would affect the time Nettles needed to warm up and complicate the band's travel to its next show. Sugarland tour manager Hellen Rollens told investigators with the Indiana Occupational Safety and Health Administration that there was no discussion of delaying the show. Earlier this month, Indiana regulators released a report saying Ms Hoye and other fair officials were too slow to order an evacuation. IOSHA fined the State Fair Commission $6,300 for failing to conduct proper safety evaluations of its concert venues. It also called the commission's emergency plan inadequate. The agency also cited Mid-America, the company that erected the stage rigging, and the union whose members worked on the structure for various workplace violations.","Lawyer James H.

"By . Alex Gore . Last updated at 2:04 PM on 21st February 2012 . A ground assault by Syrian forces on the resistance stronghold of Homs looks imminent, as Government tanks and troops mass outside the city today. Reports say Government troops have killed 21 people and wounded some 340 with a heavy artillery barrage on the city. Activists are warning of a new round of fierce and bloody urban combat being unleashed - despite efforts by the Red Cross to broker a cease-fire to allow emergency aid in. A flood of military reinforcements has been a prelude to previous offensives by President Bashar Assad's regime, which has tried to use its overwhelming firepower to crush an opposition that has been bolstered by defecting soldiers and hardened by 11 months of street battles. Regime: Syrian tank in Erbeen, near Damascus, yesterday . Defences: Sandbags piled high in a Homs street yesterday . Rami Abdul-Rahman, who heads the Britain-based activist group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said 'human loss is going to be huge' if government forces retake the Baba Amr district of Homs. Russia's UN Ambassador Vitaly Churkin said Russia will put forward a proposal at the UN Security Council in the coming days regarding humanitarian aid to Syria, the Itar-Tass news agency reported. Churkin told Vesti 24 television on Monday that the council 'could undertake concrete steps aimed at solving humanitarian issues, relying, among other things, on the fact that Damascus allowed the Red Cross to bring humanitarian aid to some regions.' But Churkin gave no details about the proposal. Russia and China have vetoed two Security Council resolutions backing Arab League plans aimed at ending the conflict and condemning the government crackdown. Rebels: Militants look out from the rooftop in Idlib today . Resistance: Free Syrian Army militant clutching his gun in Idlib . The central city of Homs - and in particular Baba Amr - has become a critical ground for both sides. Attack: Smoke rises from Saraqib, near Idlib, today . The opposition has lionised it as 'Syria's Misrata' after the Libyan city where rebels fought off a brutal government siege. Assad's regime wants desperately to erase the embarrassing defiance in Syria's third-largest city after weeks of shelling - including a barrage of mortars that killed up to 200 people earlier this month. At least nine people were killed in shelling Monday, activists said. In neighboring Lebanon, security officials said at least three wounded Syrians were brought for treatment in the eastern town of Chtoura. The officials said the wounded came from the Baba Amr attacks. Another massive death toll would only bring further international isolation on Assad from Western and Arab leaders. Syria-based activist Mustafa Osso said he does not think the regime will be able to retake Homs through military force as residents plan to fight until 'the last person.' He added that Homs is facing 'savage shelling that does not differentiate between military or civilians targets.' Clashes between military rebels and Syrian forces are growing more frequent, with defectors taking control of small pieces of territory in the north and parts of Homs province - the country's largest stretching from the border with Lebanon in the west to Iraq and Jordan in the east. Tehran: Iranian warship crossing the Suez Canal earlier . The mobilising of Government forces to outside Homs comes just days before a referendum on Sunday on giving political opposition a bigger role to challenge Assad's Baath Party, which has controlled Syria since a 1963 coup. Assad's opponents have dismissed the referendum as superficial. 'The massacre in Syria goes on,' said US senator John McCain during a visit to Cairo, where he urged Washington and its allies to find a way to help arm and equip Syrian rebels. McCain, a senior member of the Senate Armed Service Committee, said he did not support direct US weapons supplies to Syrian opposition forces, but has suggested the Arab League or others could help bolster the fighting power of the anti-Assad groups. Wounded: Two Syrian men injured by shelling in Baba Amr are treated in Lebanon today . Casualty: A third Syrian man wounded in the bombardment is treated in Lebanon's Bekaa valley . The US, he said, could assist with equipment such as medical supplies or global positioning devices. 'It is time we gave them the wherewithal to fight back and stop the slaughter,' he said. Assad's fall also would be a potentially devastating blow for his close ally Iran, which counts on Syria as its most reliable Arab ally and a pathway for aid to Tehran's patron Hezbollah in Lebanon. But McCain urged for 'like-minded' Western and Arab nations also to guard against attempts by al-Qaeda or other extremists to exploit a leadership vacuum if the regime crumbles. 'For us to sit back and do nothing while people are being slaughtered... is an affront to everything America stands for and believes in,' said McCain, suggesting that the Republicans could seek to make Syria a central campaign issue in this year's US presidential election. But US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, on a visit to Mexico on Monday, dodged a question about whether the country could accept Arab nations or others arming the Syrian rebels. Bombardment: Shelling by government forces of Baba Amr yesterday . 'We are all working for the planned friends of Syria meeting at the end of this week, which we think will give us a chance to come together and chart a way forward,' she said. She said the meeting in Tunisia 'will demonstrate the Assad regime is increasingly isolated and that the brave Syrian people need our support and solidarity.' But she said that should be expressed through humanitarian help and encouragement to the Syrian opposition to promise that everyone they will be represented in a new Syria. In Cairo, Arab League Secretary General Nabil Elaraby suggested at a news conference that Russia and China - two countries that recently supported Damascus by vetoing a UN Security Council resolution condemning Assad's regime - may be shifting their positions. 'There are some indications, especially from China and to some degree from Russia that there may be a change in their stance,' he said, without elaborating. Syria-based activist Mustafa Osso said Assad's military should face strong resistance as residents plan to fight until 'the last person.' He added that Homs is facing 'savage shelling that does not differentiate between military or civilians targets.' Refuge: Families shelter from the government bombardment in Homs . The Baba Amr neighborhood on Homs' southwest edge has become the centerpiece of the city's opposition. Hundreds of army defectors are thought to be taking shelter there, clashing with troops in hit-and-run attacks each day. Amateur videos posted online showed what activists said were shells falling into Baba Amr. Black smoke billowed from residential areas. Phone lines and Internet connections have been cut with the city, making it difficult to get firsthand accounts from Homs residents. In Geneva, a spokeswoman for the International Committee of the Red Cross said the group has been in talks with Syrian authorities and opposition groups to negotiate a cease-fire in some of the most violence-torn areas. 'We are currently discussing several possibilities with all those concerned, and it includes a cessation of fighting in the most affected areas,' the spokeswoman, Carla Haddad, said. She said the talks weren't aimed at resolving any of the entrenched political differences. ""The idea is to be able to facilitate swift access to people in need,"" Haddad said. Tough talk: UN General Assembly President Nasser Abdulaziz al-Nasser, left, and Arab League Secretary General Nabil al-Arabi last night suggested China and Russia may get toug with Syria . Clashes between military rebels and Syrian forces are growing more frequent and the defectors have managed to take control of small pieces of territory in the north as well as parts of Homs province, which is Syria's largest stretching from the border with Lebanon in the west to Iraq and Jordan in the east. Increasingly, Syria appears to be careening toward an all-out civil war. Activists believe Assad may be trying to subdue Homs - an important stronghold for anti-Assad groups - before a planned referendum Sunday on a new constitution. The charter would allow a bigger role for political opposition to challenge Assad's Baath Party, which has controlled Syria since a 1963 coup. But the leaders of the uprising have dismissed the referendum as an attempt at superficial reforms that do nothing to crack the regime's hold on power. 'We have called for a boycott of the referendum which cannot be held while parts of Syria are a war zone,' said Omar Idilbi, a Beirut-based member of the opposition Syrian National Council. The UN last gave a death toll for the conflict in January, saying 5,400 had been killed in 2011 alone. But hundreds more have been killed since, according to activist groups. The group Local Coordination Committees says more than 7,300 have been killed since March of last year. There is no way to independently verify the numbers, however, as Syria bans almost all foreign journalists and human rights organizations. In the western Hama province, troops backed by armored personnel carriers and military buses stormed several villages, conducting raids and arrests. A 32-year-old man was killed by gunfire from a security checkpoint in the area, activists said.

The last version of Edvard Munch's masterpiece 'The Scream' still in public hands, will be sold this spring in New York, Sotheby's auction house have announced. Sotheby's estimates that the work, which has become a modern icon of human anxiety, will sell for $80 million (£50.6 million) or more. The painting is one of four versions created by the Norwegian artist and the only one in private hands. Icon: Sotheby's estimate that the work, which has become a modern icon of human anxiety, will sell for $80 million or more . Edvard Munch (1863 – 1944) was a Norwegian Symbolist painter, and print maker. He grew up in Norway's capital, Oslo, and his father was a deeply religious military doctor. His mother died when Munch was only five years old, and his sister also died. Munch himself was often ill. In his art Munch turned again and again to the memory of illness, death and grief. Although he originally enrolled to study engineering, he left college to study art and in later years he exhibited his work in Paris, Berlin and Oslo. The Scream is well established as the epitome of Munch's work as an artist and forms part of a series called The Frieze of Life. Describing his inspiration for the painting Munch said:   'I was out walking with two friends - the sun began to set - suddenly the sky turned blood red - I paused, feeling exhausted, and leaned on the fence - there was blood and tongues of fire above the blue-black fjord and the city - my friends walked on, and I stood there trembling with anxiety - and I sensed an endless scream passing through nature.' The 1895 drawing of a man holding his . head and screaming under a streaked, blood-red sky is being sold by . Norwegian businessman Petter Olsen, whose father was a friend and patron . of Munch's. 'I have lived with this work all my life, and its power and energy have only increased with time,' Olsen said. 'Now, however, I feel the moment has come to offer the rest of the world a chance to own and appreciate this remarkable work, which is the only version of 'The Scream' not in the collection of a Norwegian museum.' The Munch Museum in Olso possesses one painted version of the work and another pastel version. The second painting is displayed at The National Gallery of Norway. But it is the pastel work that Olsen owns, which is thought to be the most colourful and vibrant of the four, that is up for auction. It is also the only version still in its original frame hand-painted by the artist and includes his poem which explains his inspiration behind the work. In the poem, Munch described himself 'shivering with anxiety' and said he felt 'the great scream in nature.' The pastel is the only version that also features one of the two figures in the background looking out to the cityscape. The . director of the National Museum in Oslo, Audun Eckhoff, said that . Norwegian authorities approved the Munch sale a few months ago. 'Our consideration was that it is acceptable, since several versions of `The Scream' remain in Norway,' he said. Olsen . said proceeds will go toward the establishment of a new museum, art . center and hotel in Hvitsten, Norway, where Olsen's father and Munch . were neighbours. Work of art: A self-portrait by Norwegian artist Edvard Munch, a Norwegian Symbolist painter, and print maker . Hot property: In 2004, one of the paintings was stolen, along with Munch's Madonna artwork, pictured. but they were both recovered and put back on display four years later . Sotheby's senior vice president Simon Shaw said the artwork is 'one of very few images which transcends art history and reaches a global consciousness.' He added: 'For collectors and . institutions, the opportunity to acquire such a singularly-influential . masterpiece is unprecedented in recent times.' If . it fetched $80 million or more, it would place it alongside auction . record holders, such as Picasso's Nude, Green Leaves and Bust, which . holds the current record after it sold for $106m (£70m) at Christie's in . New York in May 2010. The Scream has been the target of several high-profile art thefts in recent years. In . 2004, one of the paintings was stolen, along with Munch's Madonna . artwork, but they were both recovered and put back on display four years . later. Sotheby's New York: Sotheby's senior vice president Simon Shaw said the artwork is 'one of very few images which transcends art history and reaches a global consciousness' The sale will allow this 1895 version to go on public display in London and New York for the first time. The work will be on view at Sotheby's in London starting April 13 and then in New York starting April 27.

A millionaire City lawyer jailed after hatching an elaborate kidnap story to escape a drink-drive charge has been freed just one month into his prison term as an 'act of mercy'. Francis Bridgeman, 43, drunkenly crashed his £50,000 Range Rover into a telegraph pole but tried to escape punishment by telling detectives he had been the victim of a kidnapping. However, after 200 hours of wasted police time and a court case in which he was jailed for a year for perverting the course of justice, Bridgeman was freed after one month as an act of mercy to his seriously ill wife. Rocky road: CCTV footage showed Bridgeman stumbling along a platform just before he said he had been kidnapped . The top lawyer had been originally convicted after Lewes Crown Court heard he crashed his car following a five-pint drinking session with a friend last April. His claim to police that he had been kidnapped unravelled . when CCTV footage showed him weaving drunkenly along a train platform at . London Bridge Station after a post-work pub binge, where he drank five . pints of Guinness with a friend. Today, after hearing of Bridgeman’s wife’s very serious illness, three senior judges quashed the sentence to allow him to go back home and care for her. Mr Justice Lloyd Jones, sitting with Lord Justice Toulson and Sir Christopher Holland, told the Court of Appeal that, but for his wife’s situation, the sentence would have been appropriate. Bridgeman was missing for some time after his car was found locked, with its air bag activated, on a verge in Shovers Green, Ticehurst, East Sussex, the judge said. When he returned home, he was questioned by police and gave an elaborate account of being kidnapped, hooded and then dumped in a field by his assailant. However, investigations revealed that he had been out drinking in London after work and was seen unsteady on his feet at London Bridge Station. A long walk home: Bridgeman walked for three hours back to his oasthouse in East Sussex . Tests showed he would have been over the limit when the smash occurred. Investigation of the air bag in his car, which would have been sealed, also revealed the presence of his DNA, suggesting he was behind the wheel when it crashed. Bridgeman continued to deny the lies in court, but by the time he was sentenced had accepted that he was guilty, the appeal judge continued. His legal team today argued that mercy should be afforded to allow the disgraced lawyer, who is now unemployed, to go back to his wife. (File picture) Bridgeman, 43, drunkenly crashed his £50,000 Range Rover Sport into a telegraph pole . Judge Guy Anthony had originally jailed Bridgeman for 12 months and told Lewes Crown . Court (pictured) the sentence would have been less if he hadn't spun his . web of lies . She is emotionally and physically dependant on her husband and her condition would make prison visits almost impossible, the court was told. 'Throughout her illness, the appellant has been his wife’s principle carer. He had taken extensive periods off work to care for her,' the appeal judge said. 'Having regard to all of the matters, we have come to the conclusion that, as an act of mercy in exceptional circumstances, this court should intervene. 'In doing so, we make it clear that we expressly disregard this appellant’s fall from grace. 'The court is able to take the course it takes today simply because of the extreme condition of the appellant’s wife.' The 12-month sentence was suspended for two years.","Francis Bridgeman jailed for a year for perverting the course of justice .

Robinson, prosecuting, said Bendtner was spotted driving his . convertible Porsche 911 Turbo at 103.6mph for 0.137miles at 10.53am on . December 10. Barry . Warburton, defending, said: 'I understand he was going to Newcastle . Airport, he was slightly late for a flight and unfortunately he speeded.

In my respectful submission, . your public duty can be discharged by treating him with leniency.' The solicitor said his client had 'substantial' disposable income and could pay the fine immediately with a credit card. Chairman of the bench Edward Wardrobe imposed a 56-day driving ban, and fined the footballer £660, plus £30 costs and a £15 victim surcharge. No penalty points were added to the three Bendtner has on his licence. In 2009, his father Thomas said his son was 'lucky' to escape with only cuts and bruises after crashing his Aston Martin on the way to training.

Inappropriate: A witness claimed that accused Gabe Watson (left) made remarks at the funeral of his wife Tina (right) about her 'perky breasts' Gabe Watson, who is accused of murdering his wife on their honeymoon, allegedly said: 'At least her breasts are perky' when he viewed his bride in her coffin. The bizarre revelation came from Amanda Phillips, Mrs Watson's maid-of-honour, who said Gabe made the remark to her at her best friend's wake. Mrs Watson, 26, drowned during a scuba diving trip on her honeymoon in Australia in 2003. Gabe Watson, 34, is suspected of killing . his wife . after he turned off her air supply, the prosecution claimed. He is . facing a life sentence without parole. Amanda Phillips made an emotional testimony to the Alabama court today. Ms Phillips recounted how she went to view her friend in the coffin with Gabe Watson. She told the court: 'I said she looked pretty in her dress. Gabe said, ''At least her breasts are perky.''' Following the funeral, Ms Phillips said . her suspicions were aroused by Watson's actions. At his home after the . service, he reportedly showed pictures of his late wife next to a sign which read . 'Caution: Drowning'. Ms Phillips said her best friend had broken up with Gabe Watson in the months before their wedding . after she fell for another man. However she later returned . to Watson, reported the Courier-Mail. Ms Phillips said initially she had been convinced that her friend's death in the Great Barrier Reef,  11 days after she . married, was a tragic accident. The defense contends Mrs Watson's death was an accidental drowning. Gabe Watson served 18 months in prison in . Australia after pleading guilty to a manslaughter charge in his wife's . death but that charge involved negligence, not an intentional killing. The accused's allegedly odd remarks about his dead wife came to light as another witness testified today that the diving firm violated its own rules in . preparing the woman for the fatal trip in 2003. Horrific death: Tina Watson is seen lying on the bottom of the sea in this chilling photo as a rescuer rushes to save her in October 2003 - this photo was shown in court . Happiness: Gabe and Tina Watson on their wedding day in 2003 - 11 days before Mrs Watson drowned during a honeymoon diving trip . Wade Singleton, who was dive master on the . trip, said 26-year-old Tina didn't get a . private briefing or an orientation dive before going into the water with . her husband - despite policies that require both. Mr Singleton admitted that he and . other crew members didn't ask a number of questions of Mrs Watson - a . novice with only 11 previous dives. Government regulations in Australia required professional diving teams to make in-depth, individual assessments of divers' skills. However employees on the boat, the Spoilsport, didn't perform all the checks on Tina Watson or other divers, Mr Singleton said. Defense lawyer Brett Bloomston asked: 'Were you not aware that she had never been in the ocean in an open water dive?' Remembering details: Amanda Phillips, Tina Watson's best friend, testifies to the Alabama court (left) along with Wade Singleton (right) who lead the fateful diving trip in 2003 . Mr Singleton, who now works as a paramedic, said: 'No, I was not.' The former dive master said Mrs Watson's new husband Gabe was considered an experienced diver because he had 55 previous dives, including more than a dozen in the ocean. I said she looked pretty in her dress. Gabe said, 'At least her breasts are perky.' Amanda Phillips exchange with Gabe Watson at wife's funeral . Both he and his wife declined an orientation dive on the Great Barrier Reef site with an expert. The prosecution asked Mr Singleton: 'You can't make them take the dive if they don't want to take the dive?' He responded: 'No, I can't.' The jury of eight women and six men have previously looked at a haunting underwater photo taken by another diver of the death scene. It . showed Tina sprawled in deep water as Watson swam to the surface. Prosecutors appeared to attempt to cast doubt on Watson's version of . what happened. Support: Gabe Watson, centre, and his new wife Kim, second left, pictured last week at his trial in Alabama where he is accused of murdering his first wife Tina . They believe . Watson turned off his wife's air supply while both were underwater and . held her in a bear-hug until she lost consciousness - before turning the . air back on and letting her sink. Tina Watson's father, Tommy Thomas, left the courtroom in tears today as an Australian medical examiner showed jurors autopsy photos. Dr David John Williams said an examination determined the woman drowned and he ruled out other factors including a heart problem that she'd had several years earlier. Prosecutors contend Watson killed his wife in hopes of collecting $210,000 in insurance benefits. Caesar Lamonica, a manager at the store where Tina Watson worked, testified that Watson came in less than a month after her death asking about a life insurance policy. The defense has argued that Watson did not stand to make financial gain because Tina Watson's father was the beneficiary of her life insurance policy and a travel insurance policy only covered expenses. The trial continues.","Comment made by Tina Watson's husband Gabe to her best friend at wake .

"By . Alex Gore . Last updated at 5:59 PM on 20th February 2012 . UN inspectors arrived in Iran today in the latest push to hold key talks with Iranian officials about how far the country's controversial nuclear programme has come. Herman Nackaerts, a senior UN nuclear official, said yesterday in Vienna that he hoped for progress, but his careful choice of words suggested little expectation the meeting will be successful. Their visit comes amid rising tensions after Israel announced it was planning to deploy rocket interceptors from its 'Iron Dome' defence system in the . Tel Aviv region from today. Key talks: Chief inspector Herman Nackaerts in Vienna on his way to Iran . A spokesman said the technology was being incorporated into the 'heart of the Israeli military' and would be set up in different areas in the Gush Dan region of Tel Aviv in the coming days. He stressed that the deployment was intended as a . training exercise only, but it will serve to fan speculation that Israel is . gearing up for conflict. Israel has become even more wary of its Middle Eastern neighbour after two Iranian warships docked at a Syrian . port on Saturday - passing through the Suez Canal for only the second . time since the Islamic revolution in 1979. The vessels - a supply ship and a destroyer - have docked in Tartus, a port city in the volatile country which has been gripped by an 11-month uprising against President Bashar Al-Assad. Iranian Defence Minister Ahmad Vahidi said the transit of the two ships through the Suez Canal into the Mediterranean 'is a symbol of our nation's marine capability,' it was reported in the Daily Telegraph. Enrich: Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's looking at a metal-encased rod with 20% enriched nuclear fuel last week . Nuclear: Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, centre, on a visit to Natanz Uranium Enrichment Facility, 200 miles south of the capital Tehran . Israel, which said it will be watching the ships closely, has welcomed sanctions against Iran in a bid to halt its nuclear ambitions. But it has pointedly refused to rule . out a military response to the crisis and in recent weeks sent signals . that its patience is running thin. British Foreign Secretary William . Hague and the U.S. warned such an offensive would have grave . consequences for the entire region and called on Israel to give . international sanctions against Tehran more time to work. Warning: British Foreign Secretary William Hague has urged Israel not to attack Iran . U.S. joint chief of staff, General . Martin Dempsey said an attack would not be 'prudent'. It was not known whether . their messages were co-ordinated. Mr Hague's rhetoric goaded Iran into cutting off oil sales to British companies after he accused the Islamist regime of promoting terrorism. The oil ministry in Tehran announced . that it had ceased all sales to the UK and France, escalating diplomatic . tensions triggered by Iran’s nuclear programme. But the move will have little effect . on British firms, which get well under one per cent of their oil from Iran . since the European Union has already slapped sanctions on the country. The visit by the UN inspectors is the second in less than a . month by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) team and . reflects growing concerns over alleged weapons experiments - something . Iran denies and refuses to discuss. The West suspects Iran's nuclear . programme is geared toward making weapons but Iran insists it is for . peaceful purposes only, such as power generation. Iran's . state TV said the IAEA team arrived this morning for a two-day visit. The state radio, meanwhile, said the inspectors hope to meet Iranian . nuclear scientists and pay a visit to the Parchin military complex. The . radio said the IAEA had requested to visit Parchin, an Iranian military . base and conventional weapons development facility outside of Tehran. The . site has also been suspected of housing a secret underground facility . used for Iran's nuclear programme - a claim denied by the Iranians. Show of military might: One of the two Iranian warships which crossed the Suez Canal before docking at a Syrian port yesterday in a move which will undoubtedly increase tensions in the volatile region . IAEA inspectors visited the site in 2005, but only one of four areas of potential interest within the grounds. The nuclear watchdog did not report any unusual activities, and has not mentioned Parchin in its reports since 2008. 'Whatever the reasoning of the agency is, it proves the IAEA is not loyal to its previous commitments,' the radio said. The tone of the commentary suggested the visit to the military complex would likely be denied. The . IAEA visit comes as Iran last week announced what it described as key . advancements in its nuclear programme - inserting the first domestically . made fuel rod into a research reactor in Tehran and installing a new . generation of Iranian-made centrifuges at the country's main uranium . enrichment facility in the central town of Natanz. Secretive: Iranian state TV still of 'enrichment control' room at the Natanz facility . America . and its allies want Iran to halt uranium enrichment, which they believe . could eventually lead to weapons-grade material and the production of . nuclear weapons. Iran has been enriching uranium up to 20per cent, while . uranium enriched to more than 90per cent can be used for a nuclear . warhead. The IAEA team wants to talk to key Iranian scientists suspected of working on an alleged weapons programme. They . also hope to break down opposition to their plans to inspect documents . related to nuclear work and secure commitments from Iranian authorities . to allow future visits. Iran . has denied alleged weapons experiments for nearly four years, saying . they are based on 'fabricated documents' provided by a 'few arrogant . countries' -- a phrase authorities in Iran often use to refer to the . US and its western allies. The IAEA . summarised its information last November in a 13-page document drawing . on 1,000 pages of intelligence. It stated then for the first time that . some of the alleged experiments can have no other purpose than . developing nuclear weapons. 2012 was supposed to be the year of the economy. But as that begins, like a giant oil tanker, to slowly change direction, Iran is another mighty problem looming on the horizon for Barack Obama, right. The U.S. president promised a change of approach – who will forget the feeling of hope that accompanied his ‘New Day’ address to the Iranian people soon after his inauguration? But some White House officials are now referring to 2012 as the Year Of Iran. Steve Clemons, an influential blogger for the New America Foundation, a website for ‘new ideas and thinkers, is talking about ‘Obama’s impending ""Cuban missile crisis""'. And with the arrival of Iranian warships in the Mediterranean and a seriously unhappy Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu due to visit Washington in a fortnight, the Iranian problem has assumed the status of ‘major headache’. Mitt Romney is making great play of Obama’s ‘dove-ish’ approach, saying a vote for him would pave the way for Iran to get the bomb, while Newt Gingrich, who has huge financial backing, is even more gung-ho on the way to tame Tehran.Which leaves Obama with some big questions should the West’s relationship with Ahmadinejad continue to deteriorate. To strike or not to strike is the sort of dilemma that keeps presidents awake at night.","Second visit by atomic agency in a month, but officials admit there's little chance of progress .

"By . Paul Revoir . Last updated at 2:00 AM on 22nd February 2012 . The BBC last night issued a 370-word statement in a lengthy defence of its decision to show extensive coverage of Whitney Houston’s funeral. Bosses were forced into the response after receiving 118 complaints about the way the broadcaster’s news channel had remained ‘glued’ to the ceremony on Saturday, sparking accusations that it had been ‘voyeuristic’. The BBC admitted that the ‘duration’ of its coverage was ‘too long’ for some viewers and said it was ‘sorry’ it was not to the ‘satisfaction’ of all its audience. Saying goodbye: Hundreds of mourners attended Whitney Houston's funeral in New Jersey . But it said the singer had made a ‘substantial impact on late twentieth century music’ and that her death had come as ‘a great shock to the wider music industry and to her millions of fans’. In its response the broadcaster admitted that the funeral service had lasted ‘significantly longer’ than any broadcasters had expected and said once it had ‘committed’ to showing the ceremony it would not have been ‘appropriate’ to ‘opt out’ any earlier than it did. The BBC said the singer had made a 'substantial impact on late twentieth century music' For some viewers the decision to focus so much time on the ceremony sparked concerns that other events were not being given enough coverage. One said: ‘Yes, Whitney was wonderful . singer but hours and hours of live broadcast of funerals on CNN and BBC . and wherever is getting to feel kind of strange.’ Another viewer said: . ‘Much as I understand sadness at the death of Whitney Houston would BBC . and Sky kindly get on to some real news.’ One said: ‘Kinda weird that Sky News and BBC News 24 are live streaming Whitney Houston’s Funeral. Feels voyeuristic.’ Stevie . Wonder, Alicia Keys, R Kelly and a host of gospel stars performed at . Saturday’s service at New Hope Baptist Church in Newark, New Jersey. Actor Kevin Costner, who starred with Houston in The Bodyguard, fought back tears as he gave a moving eulogy. Houston’s . former husband Bobby Brown walked out of the heavily religious service, . designed to be a celebration of Houston’s life and career. The singer, 48, was found submerged in the bath in her hotel room on the fourth floor of the Beverly Hilton in Los Angeles. Send off: Houston's coffin was carried out of the church by pall bearers and loaded into the gold-coloured hearse . The cause of her death remains unclear and the results of toxicology tests are awaited. The . BBC, which is also understood to have received about 35 complaints that . it had interrupted coverage of the service, said the decision to air . the funeral had been made ‘very carefully’. Its . statement said: ‘We know from our audiences across the BBC as a whole . that there was significant interest in the death of Whitney Houston, and . we wanted to provide for that audience full, live coverage of the . occasion.’ It added: ‘This . was the funeral of a recording artist who had a substantial impact on . late twentieth century music and whose death had come as a great shock . to the wider music industry and to her millions of fans. Actor Kevin Costner, who starred with Houston in The Bodyguard, fought back tears as he gave a moving eulogy . ‘This was reflected in our viewing figures and they show that the coverage of the funeral drove significantly higher audiences for the News Channel during this period compared to the rest of Saturday.’ It said: ‘We recognise that the duration of the coverage was too long for some viewers, but we kept the news ticker going on screen throughout and those who wanted other news of the day could have turned over to BBC 1 for the main tea time bulletin there.’ The statement added: ‘The funeral of Whitney Houston gave us an opportunity to bring a significant and moving story live to our audience. We are sorry if this wasn’t to the satisfaction of all our viewers but it is part of the News Channel function to be there when major stories take place, and we felt that this was such an occasion.’ A BBC spokeswoman said: ‘The News Channel’s coverage of Whitney Houston’s funeral reflected the significant interest in her sudden death as well as acknowledging the impact she had as a global recording artist. ‘While some people felt there was too much coverage, we kept the news ticker going throughout, BBC1 ran the main teatime bulletin and there were normal radio bulletins along with the website and mobile app services, providing viewers with the best access to the day’s other news stories.’","BBC said the 'duration' of its coverage was 'too long'

"By . Luke Salkeld . Last updated at 8:41 AM on 22nd February 2012 . A grieving daughter has been ordered to pay £3,000 to a nursing home because she did not give a month’s notice of her father’s death. Sue Cann, 54, was told she had incurred the costs because a period of 28 days had to be paid in the event of a resident ‘moving out or passing away’. She received the bill the day after the funeral of her father, Kenneth, who died last month aged 79. Before his death he had spent 17 months at the care home, for which he paid £63,000 of his own money. 'Insensitive': Following the death of her father Kenneth (left), Sue Cann (right) was 'shocked' to receive a £3,000 bill because she had failed to give a nursing home a month's notice of his death . The Highcliffe Nursing Home sent a letter asking for payment, that Ms Cann received the day after her father's funeral . Yesterday Miss Cann told of her shock at being billed for failing to warn in advance that her father was going to die. She said it was both callous and ridiculous that Highcliffe Nursing Home in Highcliffe, Dorset, was demanding the hefty sum. Miss Cann said: ‘Nobody knows when they are going to die. It’s ridiculous. In effect they are saying that you have to pay 28 days after you have passed away. That is so callous.’ Mr Cann, who worked for British Gas for 42 years, was admitted to the seaside nursing home, which is run by Suffolk-based Kingsley Healthcare, after a long battle with dementia. He died on January 30, nine months after his wife Winnie, 74, lost her battle with ovarian cancer. His daughter, from Christchurch, Dorset, said: ‘Dad worked very hard and he saved as much money as he could for his retirement. Then he developed dementia and most of his money had to be spent on his nursing home fees. It’s terribly sad. My mother signed the contract before she died and I don’t know if she was aware of this  28-day clause. ‘Often you sign things and don’t check the small print. We were more concerned at the time that Dad had a place to go.’ The letter from Kingsley Healthcare informing Sue Cann of the 28-notice period required 'in the event of a resident passing away' She added: ‘He seemed happy there. He . was well looked after and I have no complaints of their care. It’s the . issue of the demand for the money. It leaves a nasty taste in your . mouth.’ Miss Cann, who works as a dog groomer, . has been told she owes £3,052.16. She said she understands the home . would incur costs in the time between the death of her father and the . arrival of another resident. However, she added: ‘I wouldn’t mind paying for a week. But to pay for a month – which covers his food, laundry and nursing care – is daylight robbery.’ And to receive the letter the day after the funeral ‘was insensitive’, Miss Cann added. The chief executive of the National Care Association said Kingsley Healthcare’s policy was not standard practice. Demand: The bill showing the outstanding amount for 27 days of February . Sheila Scott said: ‘Contracts will say . that residents need to give a month’s notice if they are going to leave. That is fair and reasonable. However, when somebody dies it is a . completely different matter. I would expect a week to ten days. Time to . clear the room, that’s what the extra days should be for.’ Last night Miss Cann said she had not heard from Kingsley Healthcare since it was made aware of her complaint. The company seemed, however, to be changing some of its policies. CEO Daya Thayan said: ‘I deeply regret any distress caused to Miss Cann and can confirm that we are in contact with her. ‘Charging for notice periods is standard industry practice and is necessary to allow care homes to keep rooms available for access by families to remove personal possessions before arrangements are made to re-let the accommodation.’ He added the notice period for death will now be reduced to seven days. The firm will also wait longer after a death to issue a letter to the next of kin.",Sue Cann received the bill for the outstanding care bill the day after her father Kenneth's funeral .
"By . Rob Cooper and Chris Brooke . Last updated at 8:13 AM on 22nd February 2012 . It's a tradition that has thrilled generations of children. But these days even an event as harmless and wholesome as the Shrove Tuesday pancake race is affected by health and safety rules. In Leeds yesterday, numerous school children were dressed in fluorescent high-visibility jackets to flip pancakes around the precincts of the newly designated Minster church. Flippin' fun: Excited pupils in fluorescent jackets race with their pancakes in Leeds yesterday . The youngsters from St Peter’s Church of England Primary School must wear the bright safety clothing on all excursions outside the school. Four years ago a similar pancake race near the Cathedral in Ripon, North Yorkshire, was called off due to health and safety concerns. Problems over the huge amount of risk assessment paperwork and insurance requirements for the public event led to it being cancelled. But it was revived the following year after churchmen and festival officials were given guidance on how to cut through some of the form-filling. Since then the races have gone from strength to strength. Bernard Bateman, local festival organiser, said after yesterday’s race involving 140 children: ‘Everyone thoroughly enjoyed it and there were no accidents. I will be glad when the Government reduces health and safety which I understand it is going to do anyway. It is quite onerous.’ Big flip: Choristers run through the cathedral Ely, Cambridgeshire, today as part of an annual race which has been taking place since the 12th century . Pancake races are held all over the country on Shrove Tuesday – the traditional feast before the start of Lent. Historically it was seen as the last opportunity to use up eggs and milk before the Lent fast. The oldest race takes place at Olney, Buckinghamshire. According to tradition, in 1445 a woman of Olney heard the shriving bell while she was making pancakes and ran to the church in her apron, still clutching her frying pan. In keeping with this first dash, competitors these days have to be local women and they must wear an apron and a hat or scarf. Yesterday it was revealed that two thirds of people don't know how to make a pancake. Researchers found that 40 per cent don't know the ingredients - and three in 10 people have never even tried to make a pancake. Sales of ready-made mixes have soared in recent years because people are too lazy to mix flour, milk and eggs. Researchers, . for shopping channel QVC, found that 59 per cent of people have dropped . pancakes on the floor - and one in eight people have accidentally hit . someone. As Britain celebrates Shrove Tuesday, students will attempt to break the . world record for the largest gathering of people simultaneously flipping . pancakes for 30 seconds. The University of Birmingham hoped to get more than 895 students together to break the record set by the University of Sheffield. Race to the line: Blessing Murombu, aged eight, wins a pancake race at Leeds Parish Church today. The Church is celebrating recently being named a Minister . Westminster race: Tracey Crouch MP, Lord Redesdale (centre) and BBC political correspondent Nick Robinson start a pancake race outside the Houses of Parliament today . Flipping: Susan Boyle flips a pancake with pupils at St Augustine's High School in Edinburgh today . Singer Susan Boyle got in on the act by spending the morning cooking with schoolchildren in Edinburgh. She donned a chef's apron and hat as she took part in a pancake-making day with young children at St Augustine's High School. She said she will be giving up chocolate for Lent. In Ely choristers took part in their traditional pancake race at the cathedral. The boys, aged between eight and 13, wore their red cassocks for the annual event.

Victoria Kay, manager of the Barista cafi bar where the Shrove Tuesday delicacy has been created, said: 'We have spent the whole of February . testing various combinations for the black pudding pancake, and our . final recipe is not only tasty, but also tosses brilliantly.' Makes: 12 . 1) Sift the flour with a pinch of . salt into a medium-sized bowl and make a well in the middle. Mix the . milk and 100ml water together. Break the eggs into the well and start . whisking slowly. Add the milk and water in a steady stream, whisking . constantly and gradually incorporating the flour as you do so. 2 Whisk until the batter is smooth and . all the flour has been incorporated.  Set the batter aside to  rest for . 30 minutes, then whisk the melted butter into the batter. 3 Heat a pan over a medium heat and . add a little melted butter. Using a ladle, pour roughly 2 tbsp of batter . into the pan and swirl it around so the bottom of the pan is evenly . coated. You want to  use just enough batter  to make a delicate,  lacy . pancake. 5 Cook the pancake for about 45 . seconds on one side until golden. Then, using a palette knife or  fish . slice, flip the pancake over and cook the other side for about 30 . seconds until it freckles. 6  Slide the pancake out of the pan . and either serve immediately or stack on a plate with baking parchment . in between. Continue until all the batter is used up. Just . add orange or lemon zest, a pinch of cinnamon, or even finely chopped herbs and a topping of your choice. An Australian chef has broken the world record for the largest ever stack of pancakes which was 2.5foot tall. Andy Wrobel, from Melbourne, put together a pile of 60 pancakes which measured a whopping 76cm. He beat the previous world record in central Melbourne yesterday after failing in an attempt last year. Andy built a tower 61cm tall almost 12 months ago before it fell over (see the video below). Record breaker: Andy Worbel builds a 76cm tall record-breaking free-standing tower of pancakes. Another attempt failed last year . The chef cooks more than 100,000 pancakes each year - and has made more than three million during a 25 year career. Mr Wrobel told ABC News in Australia that he did more than 50 hours of practice before he made his successful record-breaking attempt. 'We tried last year and we got to 61 centimetres and did pretty well. We thought we'd give it another go and this year we actually did it,' he said. 'We had a lot of practices, spent about 50 hours, probably used another quarter of a tonne of buckwheat mix, and we finally got to the point where we needed to go.'

"Last updated at 5:08 PM on 20th February 2012 . Children know the difference between right and wrong before they reach the age of two, according to new research published today. Scientists have found that babies aged between 19 and 21 months understand fairness and can apply it in different situations. They say it is the first time that having a sense of fairness has been identified in children at such a young age. Researchers say babies will watch a scene for longer if they think it contains something unfair, so in two experiments the tots were timed on how long they watched a live scenario about fairness. Right and wrong: New research shows toddlers have a grasp of morality . In the first, 19-month-olds saw two giraffe puppets given either a toy each or both toys to one of the giraffes. More... Deadly ally in fight for life: Low doses of carbon monoxide can prevent miscarriage . Boy is world's first to survive being born with heart outside his body . Longer looking times indicated that something was odd or unexpected . to the baby. In this experiment, three-quarters of the infants looked . longer when one giraffe got both toys. In a second experiment, two women faced each other with a pile of . small toys between them and an empty plastic box in front of each of . them. Groundbreaking: US scientists say it is the first time a sense of fairness has been identified in children so young . In one scenario, one woman dutifully put the toys away, while the . other kept playing, but both women were given rewards. In another . scenario, both women put the toys away and both got a reward. The watching 21-month-old infants looked reliably longer when the worker and the slacker were rewarded equally. Psychologist Stephanie Sloane, who led the study at Illinois . University, said: 'We found that 19 and 21-month-old infants have a . general expectation of fairness, and they can apply it appropriately to . different situations. 'We think children are born with a skeleton of general expectations . about fairness and these principles and concepts get shaped in different . ways depending on the culture and the environment they’re brought up . in. 'Helping children behave more morally may not be as hard as it would be if they didn’t have that skeleton of expectations.' This innate moral sense might also explain the power of early trauma, Miss Sloane said. Aside from fairness, research has shown that small children expect people not to harm others and to help others in distress. She said: 'If they witness events that violate those expectations in . extreme ways, it could explain why these events have such negative and . enduring consequences.' The findings appear in Psychological Science, a journal published by the Association for Psychological Science.",U.S. scientists say it is the first time a sense of fairness has been identified in children so young .

John Glenn, the former astronaut who became the first American to orbit the Earth, has slammed the U.S. for being unable to take workers to and from its own space station. The 90-year-old, who circled the Earth three times in five hours on February 20, 1962 and helped lead the nation into space, lambasted the county on the 50th anniversary of his feat. 'It's unseemly to me that here we are, supposedly the world's greatest space-faring nation, and we don't even have a way to get back and forth to our own International Space Station,' he told ABC. Disappointed: John Glenn, the former astronaut who became the first American to orbit the Earth, has slammed the U.S. for being unable to take workers to and from its own space station . Discussing the past: Mr Glenn (center) was the focus of the attention at a panel hosted by Ohio State on Monday . John Glenn commemorated the 50th anniversary in his flight as the first American to orbit the moon . His comments referenced NASA retiring its fleet of space shuttles last year - meaning astronauts have no way of reaching the space station unless they rent a seat on a Russian Soyuz spacecraft. This will continue until NASA, which hopes private industry will take on the job of taking astronauts to the space station, is able to create its new Space Launch System. Glenn's criticism came as NASA surprised him with a live chat with the International Space Station while he . marked 50 years since his historic spaceflight. He celebrated the anniversary at Ohio State University by kicking off a forum about NASA's future. The first man to set foot on the moon led the tributes to the first American to orbit the Earth on the 50th anniversary of the feat. Neil Armstrong was the surprise speaker at an Ohio State University gala honouring John Glenn half a century after Mr Glenn's historic 1962 space flight. Success: John Glenn pictured on 20 February 1962 after completing his mission . Rocket man: John Glenn at Cape Canaveral, beside . Mercury-Atlas 6 spacecraft 'Friendship 7'. Monday marks 50 years since . Glenn was the first American to orbit the earth . Mr Armstrong said there was a need for leadership in the space programme and Mr Glenn 'literally rose to the occasion'. Mr Glenn has had his share of accomplishments. But the former astronaut and US senator from Ohio recently said he envies Mr Armstrong and wishes he could have been part of the first manned moon landing in 1969. Mr Glenn got another surprise earlier . when Nasa enabled him to speak live with crew members from the . International Space Station. Commander Don Burbank appeared by . video link, flanked by two flight engineers floating in the zero-gravity . environment, and said the crew was delighted to help commemorate Mr . Glenn's momentous trip. Sitting on stage with NASA Administrator . Charles Bolden, he chatted by video link with three space station crew . members about space research and the future of the so called ‘final . frontier’. Mr Glenn was among the top military test pilots presented in 1959 as the Mercury Seven. The only other surviving Mercury astronaut is Scott Carpenter, who called out the memorable line: . ‘Godspeed John Glenn’ moments before the rocket ignited for Mr Glenn's spaceflight.' ‘Fifty years ago today, Friendship 7 was . orbiting planet Earth, and that helped in a very big way, paved the way . for America to become a space power, and to go to the moon, and to do . the things that we're doing right now on the International Space . Station,’ Mr Burbank said. ‘And we hope this also can help set the stage for us down the road to do even greater things.’ Mr Glenn had a light-hearted but educational exchange with the space station crew, asking them about the types and number of experiments on board - more than a hundred, they said - and explaining to his gravity-bound audience of more than 200 people that, for example, a candle burns differently in space than on Earth. When Mr Bolden asked the astronauts which experiment they'd like to hand off to Glenn if he could join them, Mr Burbank suggested research on the ‘regenerative environmental control systems’ on spacecraft. Meeting of minds: Former astronaut-turned-Senator Glenn (left) was questioned by NASA administrator Charles Bolden and they reflected on the past and future of the country's space program . Laughing matter: Mr Glenn joked that he thought they would make him clean the toilets on the spaceship . ‘That's a fancy word for our toilet,’ flight engineer Don Pettit added. Mr . Glenn took the humor in stride, replying that being ordered to fix the . toilet was ‘exactly what I thought I was going to get assigned to’. Mr Glenn also inquired about how far the space station had travelled during the course of the roughly 15 minutes they'd been talking. They hadn't kept an eye on the exact distance but said they guessed it was about one-fourth of the way around the Earth. Mr Bolden joked that Mr Glenn sometimes bugs him about making a trip to the space station. Mr Glenn became the oldest person to fly in space in 1998, at age 77.

A van driver who killed a senior RAF officer when he knocked him off his bike has been found guilty of death by dangerous driving. Group Captain Tom Barrett, who served as a personal aide to the Queen, was hit with such force by Paul Luker that he was propelled into a cycle lane on the other side of the road. Luker, 51, was convicted of causing death by dangerous driving at Harrow Crown Court, a Scotland Yard spokesman said. Convicted: Paul Luker (left) was found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving after he hit Group Captain Tom Barrett (right) as he rode his  bike . He ploughed into Group Capt Barrett as he rode home from his base along the  A40 near RAF Northolt, in west London, in March last year. Group Capt Barrett had fought in Afghanistan and Iraq and had also served as aide-de-camp to the Queen, chaperoning her on tours. Police said Group Capt Barrett, a Station Commander at the base, was cycling towards his Buckinghamshire home during rush hour on March 10 last year when he was struck from behind by dry cleaning delivery driver Luker. Swedish-born Group Capt Barrett, who had been a keen cyclist and president of the RAF Triathlon Association, was taken to St Mary’s Hospital, Paddington, in a critical condition but died later that night. Royal approval: Group Capt Tom Barrett receiving his OBE from the Queen ay Buckingham Palace in 2008 . A postmortem examination revealed the father of two daughters died of multiple injuries. Chief Superintendent Julian Worker of Hillingdon Police said: 'I knew Tom through working with him and the RAF. He was a committed member of the Safer Hillingdon Partnership. 'He was extremely well respected, charismatic and had one of those very sunny dispositions. I found him energetic and always seeking to engage with the local community, including through actively hosting events at RAF Uxbridge (before closing) and at RAF Northolt. 'He was fiercely proud of his country and the RAF. He will be sadly missed. Charismatic and well-respected: Group Capt Barrett was posted to RAF Northolt as Station Commander in September 2009, a role in which he also served as aide-de-camp to the monarch . 'My thoughts are with his wife, children and family to whom, on behalf of Hillingdon Police, I send our condolences.' After his death, military chiefs also paid tribute to their 'much loved' colleague. Air Vice Marshal Phil Osborn of 2 Group said: 'Group Captain Barrett was an officer much loved and respected by all with whom he came into contact. Our sympathies are with his family at this difficult time.' Wing Commander Jules Stilwell, Officer Commanding 32 (The Royal) Squadron, said: 'Tom was an extraordinary person.

"By . Sophie Borland . Last updated at 7:58 AM on 20th February 2012 . Alcohol will cause 210,000 deaths during the next 20 years through illness, violence and accidents, senior doctors warn. Two of Britain’s foremost alcohol specialists, Professor Ian Gilmore and Dr Nick Sheron, are calling on the Government to act quickly to avert this ‘shameful, preventable loss of life’ by outlawing cheap alcohol. They have calculated that in the next two decades there will be 70,000 avoidable deaths from liver disease and another 140,000 from drink-related strokes, heart attacks, cancer, violence, suicides and accidents. Health cost: Senior doctors want to see the outlawing of cheap alcohol, which can be sold for less than water in some supermarkets . Ministers had hoped that introducing 24-hour drinking laws in 2005 would stop revellers binge-drinking in the run-up to closing time. But police say that round-the-clock opening, in combination with supermarkets selling some alcohol cheaper than water, has left town centres resembling the Wild West. Health Service figures show there were 1.2 million hospital admissions related to alcohol last year, which has doubled in just eight years. In a BBC Panorama programme on Monday, liver specialist Dr Sheron says that liver disease is now the only major cause of death continuing to rise. He adds: ‘We have adopted the Mediterranean drinking pattern, so people will frequently drink with meals, but we haven’t lost our “feast” drinking pattern, so everyone likes to go out and get caned on a Friday night as well.’ Warning: Regular drinking could be seriously detrimental to your health, according to experts. (File picture) He also reveals that half the people . he treats for cirrhosis of the liver are female, reflecting a rise in . alcoholism and binge-drinking among women. The . stark warning that cheap alcohol needs to be banned comes days after . the Prime Minister promised to ‘stamp out’ binge drinking by bringing in . a minimum price for alcohol. David . Cameron said he wanted to follow Scotland’s proposal to make . supermarkets and pubs charge a minimum of 45p per unit of alcohol. Writing in the Lancet medical journal, Prof Gilmore, chairman of the UK . Battle: Former Number 10 spin doctor Alastair Campbell talks about his combating years of heavy drinking . Alcohol Health Alliance, a group of . health campaigners and medical bodies which aims to tackle alcohol . misuse, said: ‘We are at a potential tipping point in the UK in taking . on the shameful, preventable loss of life caused by alcohol. ‘The peak age for . alcohol-related deaths is in people aged 45-65, and alcohol is a factor . in 26 per cent of deaths in men aged 16-24 years.’ Figures show that alcohol-related injuries and illness cost the NHS £2.7 billion a year. On top of this, a recent Government report estimated that alcohol costs society between £17 billion and £22billion annually as a result of crime, sickness absence, and unemployment. In the Panorama edition, Alastair Campbell, Labour’s former communications director, talks of his own years of excessive drinking, but also questions whether the relaxation of licensing hours in 2005 contributed to the problem. He said: ‘I never bought the argument that Britain would suddenly become a continental-style drinking nation. ‘We have always had this tendency to drink to excess.’ Panorama: Britain’s Hidden Alcoholics, is on BBC1 Monday at 8.30pm.","Next two decades there see 70,000 avoidable deaths from liver disease .

She has been dubbed the 'trailer park Mata Hari' - an attractive ex-stripper recruited by the feds to implicate twin brothers accused of a white-supremacist bombing. She moved into the same Oklahoma campground, talked like a separatist and sent them racy photos of herself to win over the men's confidence over a five-year period. As the trial of Dennis and Daniel Mahon drew to a close, defense attorneys are arguing that the government's conduct was outrageous and that her actions amounted to sexual entrapment. 'Trailer park Mata Hari': A courtroom sketch showing ex-stripper-turned federal informant Rebecca Williams as she gives evidence in the trial of two white supremacist brothers accused of bombing a black official in Arizona . But during closing arguments yesterday, prosecutor Michael Morrissey told the jury that the hiring of the informant - identified in court records as Rebecca 'Becca' Williams - was 'entirely permissible and necessary' to the investigation of the 61-year-olds. 'There was no use of sex to obtain evidence,' he said. The jury began deliberating whether to convict the brothers, who have pleaded not guilty, after closing statements ended late last yesterday. A verdict is expected by the end of next week. The brothers are accused of sending a package bomb in 2004 that maimed Don Logan, a black man who was the diversity director for the Phoenix suburb of Scottsdale at the time. Entrapped? Defense lawyers for Dennis (left) and Daniel Mahon (right) claim the government have used 'outrageous' methods in their attempt to convict the twins . Logan, 54, was hospitalized for three days after the bombing and needed four operations on his hand and arm. The bombing also wounded a secretary. Morrissey said the Mahons were believers in 'racial terrorism and violence as a way to accomplish their goals.' The trial, which began on January 10, has been filled with drama as Williams took the stand for several days, and Logan himself described the bombing in detail for the jury. The real Mata Hari: The Dutch exotic dancer was executed by France in 1917 for spying on Germany . Williams, who is 20 years younger than the Mahons, said agents with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives recruited her after they worked with her brother, himself an informant, to infiltrate the Hells Angels motorcycle gang. At the time, Williams testified, she . was about to be evicted from her trailer and needed the money. She . received a total of $45,000, including expenses, and said she was . promised $100,000 upon the Mahons' conviction. Investigators . had her pose as a separatist who was fleeing an arrest warrant and was . interested in learning about Aryan resistance and how to make a bomb so . she could use one on a child molester she knew. The story was a fabrication designed to get the brothers to open up about the Scottsdale bombing. Williams also gave the Mahons at least . two racy photos — one that showed her in a black leather vest, fishnet . stockings, chaps and a Confederate flag bikini bottom, along with a note . that read: 'Thought you'd love the butt shot.' Another . photo showed her in a white bikini top, a grenade hanging between her . breasts, as she posed in front of a pickup truck and a swastika. Prosecutors said the brothers belonged . to the White Aryan Resistance, an organization that encourages members . to act as 'lone wolves' and commit violence against non-whites and the . government. They played for jurors hundreds of hours of video and audio surveillance of the brothers and Williams. Target: The Mahons deny orchestrating the delivery of a package that detonated in the hands of former Scottsdale diversity director Don Logan (above) Williams . testified last month, wearing a gray pantsuit with a dress shirt . buttoned up to her neck and black high heels, her long, dark hair pinned . up. Under tense cross-examination, she acknowledged previously being an exotic dancer and became bashful when asked whether she knows how to use her body around men. The 'Mata Hari' nickname that the defense gave her at the beginning of the trial is a reference to the exotic dancer convicted of working as a spy for Germany during World War I. During closing arguments, . defense attorney Deborah Williams accused the government of acting like a . 'pimp' to get the Mahons talking. Scene: Dennis and Daniel Mahon were arrested at their home in David Junction, Illinois (pictured) On the move: The Mahon brothers were living in Tempe in the months before the 2004 bombing, but relocated to Catoosa, where the Feds sent their informant . 'What you have in Dennis Mahon is a loud-mouth — sometimes drunk ... and looking for the attentions of a younger woman who throws herself at him, and she works him like she once worked a pole,' Deborah Williams said. 'And of course he fell for it.' The defense attorney also referred to footage of the informant covering up a video camera with a towel after a naked Dennis Mahon got into her hotel bed. Prosecutors said Rebecca Williams gave him a foot rub; the defense attorney said that was ridiculous. 'The whole investigation was scripted around sex, sex and more sex, from the grenade between the breasts to the sleeping with him,' Deborah Williams said. Judge David Campbell urged jurors to exercise particular caution when considering Williams' testimony, since she was paid for her involvement. The Mahons, who were living in the Phoenix area at the time of the bombing, but left days afterward and were arrested in 2009 in Davis Junction, Illinois, are charged with various explosives-related offenses, including conspiracy to damage buildings and property.","Rebecca Williams recruited to implicate twins accused of blowing up black man .

Pay-out: Playboy girl Stephanie Adams said she was left traumatised and injured when cops manhandled her after a cab driver told them she was carrying a gun . A former Playboy model has been awarded $1.2 million (£780,000)  after a Manhattan court ruled she was the victim of excessive force by the NYPD. Stephanie Adams, 40, said she was left traumatised and injured when cops manhandled her after a cab driver told them she was carrying a gun. 'I waited six years for this,' an emotional Ms Adams said after the jury gave her $350,000 more than her lawyer had asked for, reported the New York Post. Ms Adams was taking the taxi driven by Eric Darko on May 25 back her to apartment in New York when he refused to bring her any closer to her building, according to Ms Adams. The first openly lesbian Playmate, testified that Darko . started cursing and threatening her, so she called 911 for help. He then also called them, but made up a tale that she had . threatened to shoot him. According to the New York Post, the driver, later told city investigators that he believed Ms Adams was a vampire. Five officers were sent to the scene on high alert, and Ms Adams, had several guns pointed at her by plainclothes cops. She . testified that they searched her bags and although she  following . instructions to keep still  and keep her hands visible, one of them . shoved her face . down in the street, and kept her there with pressure on her neck and . her lower back. Ms Adams, testified that during a ride her cab driver . Eric Dakro (right) started cursing and threatening her, so she called 911 for help . He 'mashed my face,' she testified. Sgt. John Rajan testified that she had obeyed his order not to move, but . didn’t react when he told her to lie on the ground, so he had to make her . do so with 'a controlled drop to the ground.' 'We didn’t know if . she had a firearm,' Mr Rajan testified reported the New York Post. But he hesitated when asked by trial lawyer Nina Neumunz why he hadn’t just put her up . against a car or a wall to frisk her. Ms Neumunz in court stated that the physical force was unnecessary with the tight-fitting clothing Ms Adams was wearing. Defence: The city had contended police followed proper procedure and Ms Adams' claims of being traumatized by the incident were overblown. They cited the sexy pictures of the former centerfold with guns on her website . The . niece of a former New Jersey police commissioner, Ms Adams said she was . traumatized by the treatment by cops and by having guns pointed at her. The city had contended police followed proper procedure and Ms Adams’ claims of being traumatized by the incident were overblown. They cited the sexy pictures of the former centerfold with guns on her Web site, Goddessy.com. One photos shows her behind the wheel of an NYPD patrol car,  and in others she’s shooting rifles. A juror who wanted to remain anonymous said the pictures were 'a smokescreen,' and said that for the panel, the smoking gun was the spine and neck injuries the ex-model suffered in the incident. 'No one should be treated that way,' the juror said to the New York Post. A doctor for Ms Adams testified during the trial saying the incident injured spinal discs causing her serious back pain. 'I’m very gratified,' said the former Playgirl model, adding that for her, the case wasn’t about cash, 'it was about justice.' Ms Adams previously sued Mr Darko for falsely accusing her as armed during the 2006 incident, according to NJ.com, causing his license to be revoked by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission the same year. He was also fined $2,700. Ms Adams was featured as the Playboy centerfold for their November 1992 calendar. She was the first and only playmate to declare herself a lesbian though years later become engaged to 'a loving, supportive, successful man,' she told the Post in 2009.

"By . Nick Enoch and Tamara Cohen . Last updated at 12:40 AM on 23rd February 2012 . The Second World War had been raging for more than two years, with rationing in force and mounting fears of a U-boat blockade. Faced with the prospect of food supplies being cut off, a pair of eminent scientists came up with a solution: Let them eat plankton. They planned to harvest tons of the microscopic creatures from Scottish lochs. Secret wartime letters just uncovered reveal that Professor Alister Hardy, a marine biologist at Hull University, told colleagues that plankton – the term for a range of drifting organisms found in fresh and sea water – were high in protein and could be ‘tasty’. Plans were drawn up to harvest the microscopic sea creatures to sustain Britain if food supplies were cut off during World War Two. The text reads: Fig 1. Sketch of net proposed for full-scale collection of plankton. A is a rope net used to to enable rope B to be pulled inside out. A continuous cable (left) is used to lower or raise the nets to the desired depth. To the right is the line, attached to cork, for hauling up the catch . The idea was to capture tons of copepods - which the scholars described as 'tasty' - in the tidal areas of sea lochs along the west coast of Scotland . He convinced Sir John Graham Kerr, an . MP and regius professor of biology at Glasgow University, and they . calculated that ten nets could catch enough plankton in 12 hours to feed . 357 people. In 1941 Sir John wrote to Richard . Elmhirst, director of the Scottish Association for Marine Science, who . appears to have been sceptical: ‘It is simply silly to brush the matter . aside as of no importance, when one remembers the sea off our coasts is . often soup-like in its richness with nutritive material. The boffins calculated that nets anchored in Loch Fyne would cost £90,000 and would catch over 26 tons of plankton each day. The loch is seen here in 1933 . The academics made diagrams of nets, explored areas on the west coast of Scotland where it could work and even carried out trials from 1941-43 to see if it was possible . ‘No doubt you have tested for yourself the tastiness of some types of plankton.’ Scientists reckoned that nets anchored in . Loch Fyne would cost £90,000 and would catch over 26 tons of plankton . each day. Hardy proposed: 'The plankton would be . emptied into containers and conveyed to the nearest pier where it would stand . ready to be conveyed by lorry or motor boat to the drying plant. 'Simple drying plants would be set up at . convenient points along the coast and the resulting dry plankton dispatched in . sacks to a headquarters factory for testing, sorting, mixing and final . preparation into meal... 'The anchoring and inspection of nets would . be done by motor boats which could also be continually cruising the area . investigating the richest regions of plankton.' Trials went ahead in 1941, 1942 and 1943 but . it was found that the season was too short for the scheme to work. By 1942 the first stockpiles had been . harvested, but the plankton proved trickier to catch than the . scientists expected, and the project was quietly abandoned. The letters were found by Geoffrey . Moore, emeritus professor in marine biology at the University of London, . in the Association’s archive. He said: ‘I know of only one  person who has tried plankton and he found it rather fishy  and gritty. ‘He wasn’t terribly impressed, but I suppose it would depend on how hungry you were.’ Richard Kirby of the University of . Plymouth, the author of a book about plankton called Ocean Drifters – A . Secret World Beneath the Waves, said the idea of eating plankton is not . so bizarre. Copepods are known as 'the insects of the sea' due to their large numbers. There are believed to be around 10,000 different species. Found in fresh and salt water, they measure no more than a few millimetres long. One species, found in the cold waters off the UK, is the calanus. During winter, it hibernates at a depth of 1,000m to avoid predators - and builds up lipid (fatty) stores in the process. The largest is the Pennella  Balaenopterae, which lives on the finback whale and can grow to over a foot long. Copepods are crustaceans - and the largest source of protein in the ocean. They have two antenna, a shell and segmented . bodies and graze on phytoplankton and zooplankton. He added: ‘The Germans had similar plans during the war, and there are still people trying to do this today.’ Prof Moore, who is also president of the . Society for History of Natural History, said he was not surprised at what he . found. He said: 'Marine biologists come up with a . lot of strange ideas. But this scheme was not that odd - there are fisheries . for various plankton in Japan and Scandinavia. 'I've been interested for many years in the . history of marine biology and for the last ten years have been delving into . all sorts of historic marine biology archives. 'When I found these letters, I thought I . would write them up as an academic paper. 'Sir Alister Hardy thought it was a way he . could contribute to the war effort, because he wasn't in the forces himself. 'There was plenty of plankton around, but . there was the question of how easy it would be to catch. You would need a very . large net with a very small mesh. War-time rations in 1944. Plankton was suggested as a back-up food resource . A fish queue in Hammersmith, west London in 1945 . Some societies eat plankton directly. The Japanese dish Okami is made from krill, a shrimp-like plankton . 'There would be the problem of the pressure . of the water trying to push through a net, which would become clogged up with . debris - not to mention basking sharks. 'I only know of one person who has tried . plankton and he found it rather fishy and gritty. Unlike a prawn, which you can . peel, the exoskeleton was still intact. 'He wasn't terribly impressed, but I suppose . it would depend on how hungry you were. 'And I expect it was intended that the . plankton would have been added to other foods rather than eaten on its own.'","Plan to catch tons of copepods in sea lochs along Scottish west coast .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 3:38 AM on 23rd February 2012 . In the dock: George Huguely V arrives for the final day of his trial, hours before being found guilty of second-degree murder . A former University of Virginia lacrosse player was today found guilty of killing his girlfriend in a drunken argument. George Huguely V was acquitted of first-degree murder, but found guilty of second-degree murder in the death of Yeardley Love. The jury recommended that the 24-year-old be sentenced to 26 years in prison, but he will not be formally sentenced until April. Huguely is believed to have killed Ms Love in a  jealous rage fuelled by her relationship with a North Carolina lacrosse player. The verdict came after nine hours of deliberation, and while it fell short of the most serious charge it was nonetheless more serious than the manslaughter charge which some analysts predicted would be the eventual verdict. Huguely, of Chevy Chase, Maryland, did not visibly react to the verdict, and there was no overt sign of emotion in the courtroom, which included families of the victim and the defendant. Jurors who convicted Huguely immediately began hearing testimony in the sentencing phase, which included a tearful response from Ms Love's mother, Sharon Love. She described the death of her daughter as 'unbearable', and added: 'Every year that goes by I'd like to know what she'd be doing now.' Love's sister, Lexie, 28, described the absence of her kid sister. 'A song will come on the radio and I'll just burst out in tears,' she said, sobbing. Her sister's death, she said, 'left a large hole and nothing will fill it.' 'No person is the sum of the worst decision he ever made,' one of Huguely's defence attorneys told jurors before they began deliberating his punishment. The jury of seven men and five women had to decide whether Huguely battered Ms Love to death in a jealous outburst or if his intent to talk with her spiraled out of control, leaving her bleeding and dying in her bedroom. The jury heard from nearly 60 witnesses over nine days to determine what happened to Ms Love on the night of May 2, 2010. That night, the women's lacrosse player was found face down on her pillow. Her right eye was swollen and bruised, she had marks on her chest that suggested she was grabbed and had injuries around her jaw and inside her mouth and neck. Lovers: Yeardley Love and George Huguely, both students at the University of Virginia, had an on-off relationship . Final day: Huguely is escorted into the Charlottesville courthouse ahead of the final verdict being delivered . Jurors . heard several potentially lethal consequences of such injuries. A . coroner concluded the young woman from suburban Baltimore died of blunt . force trauma. In a . police interrogation video viewed by jurors, Huguely said he went to Ms . Love's apartment to talk about their sputtering, two-year relationship . and she 'freaked out' when he broke into her room. Their . encounter quickly turned physical, with Huguely admitting he may have . shaken her but insisting he didn't grab her neck or punch her. He also . claimed she repeatedly banged her head on the bedroom wall. A medical expert for the defence testified that Ms Love likely smothered, her face buried in her own blood-dampened pillow. Huguely's defence team has also . suggested her death was the result of drinking and a prescription drug . she took for attention-deficit disorder. A coroner said both substances . were in her body but not in potentially lethal doses. Guilty: Sentencing arguments began immediately after a verdict was reached following nine hours's deliberation . The prosecution painted a much more sinister scenario. Huguely went to her apartment less . than one week after he sent her a threatening email about her . relationship with a North Carolina lacrosse player. In the email, Huguely wrote that when he found out about the relationship, 'I should have killed you.' In his closing arguments, defence . attorney Francis Lawrence described Huguely as hulking, hard-drinking . jock but no killer. He acknowledged Huguely had an unintended, . accidental role in Ms Love's death, arguing for a finding of involuntary . manslaughter and a 10-year prison term. Last week it was revealed Huguely . wrote a letter to Ms Love shortly before she died saying that he could . not control his behaviour and apologising for choking her. During . closing arguments in the murder trial, a prosecutor said investigators . found the letter from when they arrived at the scene where she was found . dead. 'I cannot . control the way I behave,' Huguely, 24, was quoted by prosecutor Dave . Chapman as saying in the letter written in February 2010. 'Alcohol is . ruining my life.' Lacrosse: The pair were both enthusiastic sports players and were friends with the rest of the lacrosse team . In closing arguments, Mr Lawrence said the prosecution team has been . 'over-zealous' in charging Huguely with first-degree murder. 'Where's the intent to kill?' Mr Lawrence asked jurors. He said Huguely's reaction . to police, who arrested and interrogated him the morning following Miss . Love's death, showed that Huguely was 'a young man who has no clue' that . she had died. He described the student as a 'stupid drunk' who lived in a 'lacrosse ghetto' which led to a lack of perspective. On Friday, the jury heard that Huguely and Ms Love were holding hands in a bar just 24 hours before she died. Huguely's aunt and godmother, Alina . Massaro, testified that the pair were holding hands the night of . Saturday, May 1, roughly 24 hours before Huguely confronted Ms Love. The court were played a video recording of the hand-holding which was taken from a bar surveillance tape. On trial: Mr Huguely acted strangely on the night of the killing, the court has heard . The day before, the 24-year-old was . accused of lying about visiting his friends on the night she died. Former teammate Ken Clausen testified on Wednesday, the day the . prosecution rested and defence began. The defence began its presentation . with a medical expert who said he believed Ms Love was asphyxiated from . lying face down in a damp, bloody pillow. The testimony did not state . how she came to be in that position. While . Huguely acknowledged in a police interrogation that his final . encounter with Ms Love turned physical, he said he did not believe her . injuries were serious. Most of the prosecution witnesses on Wednesday were former lacrosse players, many of whom knew Ms Love. The . day before her body was found, Huguely was seen drunk during an . end-of-season father-son golf tournament and dinner, his teammates said, . describing his slurred speech and public urination. Later that night, he and other friends went to Huguely's apartment for beers and to watch TV. About . 20 minutes before midnight, they decided to go to a nearby store to . pick up some more beer while Huguely remained in the apartment, the . teammates said. They came back with the beer 15 or 20 minutes later, and . Huguely was not in the apartment but soon returned. He . told his friends he had gone to visit two other teammates in his . apartment building. One of the teammates, however, had stayed in his own . apartment and was not in Huguely's building. Asked about Huguely's demeanour, the witness said: 'He had this blank stare on his face.' Mr Clausen said he repeatedly asked Huguely what was bothering him, but 'got no response'. He said of Huguely's mood after he returned from the beer run, 'There was no doubt in my mind there was a change in his demeanour.'","George Huguely convicted of second-degree murder .

Alex knows his days are nearing an end because just over two years ago, he was given three years to live. Harris Middle School, where he was a student, is rallying around Alex to try to raise money to enable the 12-year-old to do the things he's always wanted to in the last stage of his life. They have started selling blue ribbons - his favourite colour - for 50 cents to help his family. Speaking to WKRN-TV, Alex said: 'I'm really glad to know that they want to support me and are in this with me.' Grandmother: Carolyn Camacho said she will be glad to get Alex home so she can see him every day and put her arms around him . Fundraising: Pupils at Harris Middle School are selling blue ribbons in aid of former student Alex, which will go towards his care . His grandmother Carolyn Camacho said: 'No matter what he's been through, he's always smiling and got those dimples showing, always. 'They found out that night when he was seven years old what was going on. 'The hospital asked Alex what he wanted to do. He said he didn't want to take more treatments, they didn't do any good before, they didn't work, and he doesn't want to be away from home.' His big sister Kimberly Leverette, 21, said she is proud of how strong her brother is being and that he is even handling it better than a lot of people in the family. She said: 'There are times we break down and he doesn't.' Principal, Dr Tracy Lampley told the new site: 'It must be an incredibly difficult thing to think about as a 12-year-old, I have a certain amount of time left, so what would the things be I've always wanted to do? 'We are just giving him every opportunity to enjoy, enjoy every moment.' Mrs Camacho said they are now preparing to have hospice care set up in her home. She said that being with him was the most important thing. 'Getting to see him every day and being with him, hold him and hug him, that's all that matters', she said.",Alex Rodriguez suffers from rare form of muscle and bone cancer .

Retaliation: Adam Hock, pictured yesterday, charged with beating up Monaco's Prince Pierre Casiraghi, has said he was defending the 'honour of the women he was with' A former club owner charged with beating up Monaco's Prince Pierre Casiraghi, has said he was defending the 'honour of the women he was with' - a bevy of supermodels. Adam Hock, has been accused of leaving the 24-year-old prince with a broken jaw and needing hospital treatment after he punched him at Double Seven, a Meatpacking . District bar. But Mr Hock has denied he began the brawl and said the prince and his four friends began the trouble in the early hours of Saturday morning. 'I acted 100% in self-defence. I felt I . had to defend the honor of the women I was with,' said Hock, 47 who . was pictured leaving a clinic wearing a sling on his left arm, reported New York Daily News. 'I feel I was victimized by several . drunk, entitled guys, who felt they deserved the prime table with the . most beautiful girls,' Hock told the New York Post. 'They expected to be treated like the royalty they are. They didn’t get what they wanted, and it pissed them off.' But the prince's camp insists the one-time . football jock went berserk, swinging round-house punches at anyone in . sight in the early Saturday brawl. 'The facts are very clear,' said Nadine Johnson, a spokeswoman for Casiraghi, the son of Princess Caroline and grandson of Grace Kelly, reported New York Daily News. 'There was only one person arrested, Mr. Hock, who spent two days in jail as a result of his actions. Mr Hock said he is deciding whether he will press charges against the four. Mr Hock was . sitting with two friends and three catwalk models when the prince, the third . in line to Monaco’s throne, allegedly approached him and started a . confrontation after trying to drink a $500 bottle of vodka from their table. 'I thought they were being childish, . because they then sent over another bottle of vodka, saying, ""If you . don’t want us to drink your vodka, here’s another bottle,"" ' Hock said . to the New York Post. Court: Prince Pierre Casiraghi, pictured, and his friends were accused by lawyers of being jealous because Adam Hock was with a group of beautiful women, referring to them as 'trust-fund babies' and 'spoiled brats' Friends: Stavros Niarchos III, heir to a Greek shipping fortune was with his girlfriend, model, Jessica Hart, when the fight broke out and he tried to help the prince . After a confrontation Hock is said to have punched the prince . and sent him flying into a table on the other side of the room, where he . landed with blood pouring from his face. ‘Pierre’s face looked broken, . with deep cuts and blood everywhere,’ said one witness. ‘He looked like . he needed plastic surgery.’ But Hock‘s lawyer, Sal Strazzullo, insisted that Casiraghi started the fight and threw the first punch. He accused the prince and his friends of being 'wealthy barons from Europe' with an inflated sense of ownership. 'They think New York is their honeycomb. They think they can come here and do whatever they want,' Strazzullo said to the New York Daily News. The 47-year-old was arrested and . later appeared in court, charged with four counts of assault against . Prince Pierre and three of his friends. Hock’s lawyer, Sal Strazzullo, said: . ‘My client was with some very very nice women and Mr Casiraghi became . jealous of who he was with. They wanted some recognition [from the . women] and it happened because of that. My client acted in self- . defence, it was an unprovoked attack. ‘I don’t know why Mr Casiraghi got . jealous about my client – he is from a humble background.’ He added: ‘My . client is not Bruce Lee… These four guys are trust-fund babies who . think the world is owed to them. They are like spoiled brats.’ Models: Natasha Poly, left, and Anja Rubik, right, were with Adam Hock in the Double Seven club when he allegedly started a vicious brawl with Prince Pierre of Monaco . Confrontation: The brawl broke out at the trendy Double Seven nightclub in Manhattan. This is an image from inside the club . But one of the prince’s friends said he was ‘slammed for no reason’, and that another was punched when he tried to intervene. Richard Golub, who is representing the prince and his friends, said the incident was ‘entirely unprovoked’. Pierre’s family have a long history . of  scandal and intrigue, and the latest episode seems to suggest he is . following in their footsteps. Known as the ‘party prince’, Pierre . is believed to have dropped out of university and has been seen at . nightclubs everywhere from Miami to Milan. The fight broke out on Saturday, at . the Double Seven club in Manhattan’s Meatpacking District. Prince Pierre . and his entourage, who were drinking £350 bottles of champagne, are . said to have gone over to Hock’s table and started behaving . ‘obnoxiously’. Among those with the prince was . Jessica Hart, a supermodel, Stavros Niarchos III, a shipping heir and . ex-boyfriend of Paris Hilton, Vladimir Restoin Roitfeld, a New York art . dealer and godson to photographer Mario Testino, and Diego Marroquin, a . Manhattan socialite . Among those on Hock’s table were . catwalk models Natasha Poly,  Valentina Zalyaeva and Anja Rubik, and the . club’s owner, Jeffrey Jah. Hock is said to have punched Prince Pierre . in the face and lashed out at three of his friends, one of whom . allegedly grabbed a bottle of Grey Goose vodka and tried to hit Hock . with it. The prince was taken to hospital for treatment and released a short time later. The episode once again puts  the . spotlight on Monaco’s royals – or the Grimaldi family, as they are . better known.

The president of the California Fish and Wildlife Commission has caused outrage after posing for photographs clutching a dead mountain lion. Daniel Richards, 59, is believed to have shot the animal in Idaho, where hunting the big cats is legal. However in California, the state where he is in charge of wildlife decisions, hunting mountain lions has been banned for two decades. Scroll down for video . Big game: Daniel Richards, president of the Californian Fish and Wildlife Commission, controversially poses with a dead mountain lion which he shot in Idaho where hunting the cats is legal . Legislation in California also makes it illegal to bring the corpses of mountain lions into the state - although it was unclear if Mr Richards had done this. The picture came to light after it was posted on the website of Western Outdoor News, the largest hunting and fishing newspaper in California. It shows Mr Richards dressed in camouflage, standing in snow-covered woodland, proudly hoisting up the creature which slumps over in his arms. In charge: Daniel Richards was pictured holding a trophy mountain lion - hunting the creature has been illegal for 20 years in his home state of California . Mr Richards, who is a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association, assumed the presidency of the Fish and Game Commission in 2008. His term ends next year. Californian congressman Jared Huffman told the San Jose Mercury News: 'He’s done something that’s a disgrace to his position and to responsible hunters in California.' The hunting of mountain lions has been illegal in California since 1990 after proposition 117 was passed. The legislation also set aside $30 million of state funding until . 2020 to buy up habitat to protect mountain lions and other species. The non-profit Mountain Lion Foundation, which fought for the law to be passed, has now called for Mr Richards to give up his role. On the MLF's website, it stated: 'While technically no laws were broken, California residents are disgusted and calling for Richards' immediate removal from the Commission. 'Since Richards proudly and openly defies the priorities of the people he was appointed to represent, clearly he can't be trusted and he needs to go.'","Daniel Richards, 59, accused of 'defying priorities' by going to Idaho on big game shoot ."

Comedian Frank Carson died yesterday after a battle with stomach cancer. He was 85. The Irishman, famed for his catchphrases ‘It’s a cracker’ and ‘It’s the way I tell ’em’, passed away surrounded by his extended family at his home in Blackpool. He had been ill for five years with heart problems and had suffered a hernia and a knee replacement. Last August he had a tumour removed from his stomach, but just before Christmas the cancer returned. He worked until a few months before his death, taking part in around 80 events a year. His last stand-up performance was in November. In a statement, his family said the funnyman was heading off 'for his final gig'. They said: 'He went peacefully at his home in . Blackpool surrounded by his greatest fans - his extended family. We will . be taking him home to Belfast to lay him to rest and celebrate his . joyful life. 'It's quieter down here now. God help them up there!' Carson, who once joked with the Pope that he would meet Elvis when he died, grew up in a deprived area of north Belfast known as Little Italy. The son of a binman, he worked as a plasterer and electrician before joining the Parachute Regiment. He served three years in the Middle East in the 1950s before turning to showbusiness. Starting his career in pubs and clubs, Carson became famous after winning the ITV  talent show Opportunity Knocks. He became a household name after becoming a regular on The Comedians, where he appeared alongside the likes of Bernard Manning. His charity work led to him being made a Knight of St Gregory by Pope John Paul II in 1987, one of the highest honours in the Catholic Church. In an interview with the Daily Mail in 2008, Carson told of meeting the Pope: ‘He kissed me and said I was a wonderful man. I was in there for 17 minutes – the priests time it. President Reagan only got 11, so that was nice.’ SCROLL DOWN FOR THE VIDEO . The kings of comedy: Frank with Bob Monkhouse on Celebrity Squares in 1993 . Old favourites: Frank (top) with (from left to right) Ken Dodd, David Frost and Leslie Crowther in 1986 .

Carson also said he never worried about his health or getting old. He . said: ‘It’s never occurred to me to worry about my health, or that I’ll . get old, or that people will stop laughing at me. There’s three things . you can be sure of in life  –  death, taxes and, if you’re with Frank . Carson, a bloody good laugh, ha ha.’ In the 1970s, he starred alongside Charlie Williams, Bernard Manning, Mike Reid and Jim Bowen in ITV show The Comedians. Favourite: Carson was a regular guest on children's TV show Tiswas in the late '70s . He also appeared on TV shows Who Do You Do?, Tiswas and The Wheeltappers and Shunters Social Club. Tributes . to the funnyman poured in last night. Former chat show host Sir Michael . Parkinson said: ‘He was a good comic and great company. 'He represented . that front-of-cloth comedy, it’s a different genre from the kind of . comedy that we have today, where younger and smarter comedians play big . halls – he was a club comic. And Sir Bruce Forsyth said: ‘The only trouble with Frank, as far as I’m concerned, is that he made me laugh too much.’ Tribute: Anthony McPartlin said he was 'sad' to hear of Carson's passing . Others paid tribute to him on Twitter, which included Lenny Henry, Tony Blackburn and Anthony McPartlin. McPartlin . tweeted: 'Sad news about Frank Carson.

Pictured outside Sheffield County Court today . Former miners' leader Arthur Scargill was today awarded £13,000 in damages after he sued the union he led . for 20 years. Mr Scargill, 74, sued the National Union . of Mineworkers Yorkshire Area Trust Fund (YATF) over a range of expenses he . claimed he was owed when he worked for them in a £26,000-a-year role after he . retired as NUM national president. Today, a judge at Sheffield County Court . rejected the former union boss's claim that he should have had his telephone . costs reimbursed by a trust of the union. But Judge Robert Moore ruled that Mr . Scargill was entitled to a car allowance substantially more than the £50 the . trustees eventually offered him. He awarded him £12,000 in damages. The . judge also awarded Mr Scargill a further £1,000 in damages because he was . denied membership of the NUM for ten months during the dispute. Judge Moore told the court that when the . trustees began to question Mr Scargill's contract, 'there was a clear agenda . both to disown him and to pay him as little as possible'. Mr Scargill's barrister Timothy Pitt-Payne . QC said the trust treated his client 'in a thoroughly shabby way and in a way . that was quite inappropriate, given his long and distinguished career within . the union'. Judge Robert Moore ruled Mr Scargill (seen arriving at court today) was entitled to a car allowance substantially more than the £50 the trustees eventually offered him . The court heard that Mr Scargill took up a . role with the trust after he retired from his £70,000 post as national . president of the NUM in 2002. Despite two trustees of the fund claiming . they did not realise he worked for them, Judge Moore said in his judgment that . Mr Scargill's work over the last decade was 'meaningful and considerable'. The judge outlined how the former . president's expertise was used in relation to the preparation of a range of . legal cases. Combative: Mr Scargill (centre) leads protesters through Mansfield, Notts, at the height of the miners' strike in 1984 . He said these included an aborted attempt . to reclaim £8million from the union's former solicitors, a long-running . property dispute relating to union offices in central Sheffield, and former . miners' compensation claims regarding the condition vibration white finger, a repetitive stress injury. The trustees disputed Mr Scargill's claim . that he was entitled to an allowance towards a new car. The court heard that he understood this . was a benefit which carried over after he changed jobs in 2002 and was . calculated using a complex formula but amounted to 80 per cent of the cost of a Ford . Mondeo over a four-year period. This amounted to about £14,500. Industrial action: Arthur Scargill (centre) addresses the media during the coal miners' strike of 1992 in protest at Government plans to close 40 per cent of Britain's mines . The judge was told that Mr Scargill was . paid this allowance in 2005 when he last changed his car. But five years later, when he inquired . again, the trustees began to question the very basis of his employment contract . with YATF. Mr Scargill, wearing a dark suit with a . red tie, sat behind his QC in court. The case continues this afternoon when the . judge will resume his assessment of costs.

But a down-on-its-luck Nasa is reluctantly searching for tenants to rent disused facilities at its Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The cash-strapped U.S. space agency is unable to maintain much of its base at Cape Canaveral so, rather than let it slide into ruin, has decided to let out some of its famous hangars. How it might look: A down-on-its-luck Nasa is searching for tenants to rent disused facilities, including the Vehicle Assembly Building (pictured), at its Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida . Among the facilities available to rent . are a space shuttle launchpad; two giant mobile platform launchers; two . space shuttle maintenance hangars; a huge caterpillar crawler used to . move rockets; a 52-storey Vehicle Assembly Building with four rocket . assembly bays; and a 15,000ft-concrete runway. The decision to allow private companies to rent out the  Kennedy Space Center was not made lightly. Robert . Cabana, director of the Kennedy Space Center, told the Washington Post: . 'I have a lot of facilities that we, Nasa, no longer need. 'I don’t have the money to maintain them, I don’t have the money to tear them down. They’re just going to sit and rot.' The . downturn in Nasa's fortunes comes a half century after the space centre . opened in 1962, the same year that John Glenn orbited Earth. Space shuttle Atlantis rolls to the launchpad atop a giant crawler from the Vehicle Assembly Building floor last May. The crawler is one of the unique facilities available to rent . Among the facilities available to rent are: . Renting out its facilities is symbolic of the changing times in space exploration. Kennedy Space Center once had 18,000 Nasa employees, while it now has only 7,500. Last year, Nasa's shuttle program, . which operated out of Cape Canaveral, was closed due to high operating . costs and for funds to be freed-up to develop new spacecraft that can . travel beyond the International Space Station's 220mile-high orbit. Russian and European freighters will keep the space station stocked with food, water and supplies in the immediate future. In 2010, President Barack Obama pledged the U.S. would send the first man to Mars. But earlier this month, Nasa . announced it is to cut its exploration to the Red Planet. It is part of . the space agency's plan to reduce its exploration of other planets. Touchdown: Atlantis lands on the Kennedy Space Center runway last July. The 15,000ft-long runway is one of the facilities that Nasa is seeking to let . But the agency's former science chief is calling the plan 'irrational'. With limited money for science and an . over-budget new space telescope, Nasa essentially had to make a choice . in where it wanted to explore - the neighbouring planet or the far-off . cosmos. Mars lost. Edward Weiler, who until September . 2011 was Nasa's associate administrator for science, said: 'To me, it's . totally irrational and unjustified. 'We are the only country on this . planet that has the demonstrated ability to land on another planet, . namely Mars. It is a national prestige issue.'","Among the facilities available to rent .

A father stole thousands of pounds of money from his dying son's trust fund - leaving it so bare that not enough was left to pay for his funeral, a court heard. Julian Emms, 46, set up a charity fund . for his son Michael who was Britain’s youngest victim of motor neurone . disease as a teenager. A court heard many people were touched by his plight - and did sponsored events to raise £55,000 to send brave Michael to China for pioneering stem cell treatment. Horrendous: Julian Emms, right, is alleged to have stolen £16, 500 from a trust fund which was set up for his dying son Michael, left . But father-of-three Emms is accused of 'stripping' thousands of pounds from the money left in the Michael Emms Trust Fund after the treatment failed. The court heard he left just £1,300 in the account - not enough to pay for Michael’s funeral when he died last year, aged 24. Prosecutor Meirion Davies said: 'A lot of work by a lot of good people had helped put money in that fund. 'What sort of man would trick his own son out of that money and use it for his own purposes? 'It was despicable - someone who could do something like that is beneath contempt.' Cardiff Crown Court heard how Emms tricked Michael’s grandmother Anne Brandon who was one of the four people authorised to sign the charity’s cheques. Beneath contempt: A court heard that Julian Emms left the Michael Emms Trust Fund so bare that not enough was left to pay for his son's funeral. He is pictured here with Michael . Mr Davies said: 'Emms said he was booking a holiday to the USA for Michael and needed two cheques. 'One was for £3,000 for the holiday and the other was £300 for insurance. 'Mrs Brandon wrote the cheques out to a travel agency called Travelcare and signed them - but left them blank because Emms didn’t know the exact amounts.' But the court heard Emms altered one of the cheques to get his hands on the £16,500. Problems: The court heard Emms had a £15,000 business debt at the time the cheque was cashed . The jury heard Mrs Brandon and her husband David had 'second thoughts' and asked for the cheques to be returned. Mr Davies said: 'Emms was upset that they were suspicious but they had every right to be. 'Emms went to their home and burned the cheques in front of them. 'It was theatrical and carefully calculated to hide the fact that one of them was a blank piece of paper.' The court was told Emms had already cashed one cheque for £16,500 after changing the payee to 'cash'. Mr Davies said: 'Police searched his home for the money but Emms told them: ""It is not here - I spent it"". 'He had carried out a cold-blooded and deliberate deception then lied to extricate himself from a deeper and deeper hole.' The court heard Emms, of Ebbw Vale, South Wales, had a £15,000 business debt at the time the cheque was cashed. Emms had broken up from his wife Theresa at the time he allegedly stole from the trust fund. His former mother-in-law Mrs Brandon told how she was 'devastated' when she discovered the money had been taken from her grandson’s account. She said: 'I went to the bank to check the position of the account and found £16,500 had gone. 'Lots of people had been involved. I was devastated.' Mrs Brandon said there was not enough money left to pay for Michael’s funeral when he died in April last year. Emms denies fraud.

"By . Emily Allen . Last updated at 8:36 AM on 22nd February 2012 . A former soldier who was told he would never be released from jail after being convicted of torturing gay men to death almost 20 years ago has died in jail. Colin Ireland, 57, is presumed to have died from natural causes in the healthcare centre of Wakefield Prison in West Yorkshire this morning, a Prison Service spokeswoman said. One of Britain's worst serial killers, Ireland admitted attacking and killing five gay men he . met in London pubs in 1993. Colin Ireland, 57, is presumed to have died from natural causes in the healthcare centre of Wakefield Prison in West Yorkshire . Known as the 'gay slayer', he reportedly posed as a homosexual to be taken to each of his victims' homes, where he tortured and murdered them after making a New Year's resolution in 1993 to become a serial killer. But Ireland, who terrorised London's gay community, was caught later the same year when CCTV footage showed him with his last victim. He was given a whole-life tariff in 1993. In May 2007, a report by the independent Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Advisory Group found that the Metropolitan Police inquiry was 'hampered by a lack of knowledge of the gay scene in London and the special culture of S&M bondage'. According to a Real Crime documentary on the serial killer, the unemployed drifter killed five people in just over three months, including four in just 15 days. He would meet men at The Coleherne pub in Fulham, pose as a homosexual to be invited back to their homes, and then torture and kill them following sex games. Speaking to police about his first victim, 45-year-old West End theatre director Peter Walker on March 8, Ireland said: 'I think it was something triggered in me some time before. I felt that if I was approached there was a likelihood I would kill. Colin Ireland died in HMP Wakefield's healthcare centre today at 9.20am. He is presumed to have died from natural causes . 'We went in a cab to his flat in Battersea. I put on a pair of gloves on the way. My intentions were different to his.' An avid reader of true crime books and FBI manuals, he would reportedly clean up the murder scene and stay with the body until the morning, to avoid attracting attention by leaving in the middle of the night. He also demanded money and left with the victim's credit cards, a pattern he repeated in successive murders. When he thought his first murder had gone unnoticed, Ireland, then of Southend, rang both the Samaritans and The Sun newspaper to tell them what he had done as he sought to achieve his resolution to become famous for being a serial killer. A computerised police image of the suspect police were trying to chase back in 1993. Colin Ireland was later convicted of the murders . He went on to kill 37-year-old librarian Christopher Dunn on May 28; Perry Bradley III, the 35-year-old son of a US Congressman on June 4; and Andrew Collier, 33, on June 7, along with his pet cat. Ireland told police: 'I couldn't stop myself. 'It was building up. I was on an almost sort of rollercoaster kind of thing.' He added: 'I was probably 60 per cent, 70 per cent quite a reasonable human being most of the time, but there is that side of my character that is negative, it's quite cold and calculating.' Before killing his fifth victim, 41-year-old Emanual Spiteri on June 12, Ireland called police four times to ask why they had not linked the four murders, telling them he had killed them all. 'I set out to see, because I read a lot of books on serial killers and indeed, you know, I wondered if it could possibly be done and actually got away with it,' he said. Asked why he targeted homosexuals, he told officers they 'keep their mouths shut and don't tell the police things'. He was caught when, having visited police to explain away his sighting on CCTV with Mr Spiteri, his fingerprint was subsequently matched to one found at the man's flat. He admitted all five murders. Ireland was born on March 16 1954 in a former work house in Kent to a 17-year-old mother, who was abandoned by his father, according to the documentary. A Prison Service spokeswoman said: . 'Colin Ireland died in HMP Wakefield's healthcare centre today at . 9.20am. He is presumed to have died from natural causes; a post-mortem . will follow.

The toddler, now three, and his grateful family yesterday met with the doctors and paramedics who saved his life after his heart stopped beating. Determined not to let the youngster slip away, Dr Rich Lyon continued to work on his tiny heart, when he was struck down with an illness previously unheard of in children. Priceless smile: Helicopter paramedic Jemma Varela, 31, with three-year-old Kai Clark, who died for six minutes after suffering a cardiac arrest . His mother Kelly Clark, 32, yesterday said: 'We are just so grateful that he is still with us. 'He was pronounced dead for six minutes so it is a miracle that they could bring him back. 'He suffers from a rare condition called Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy which we think is what triggered the heart attack. 'We love him so much and I just don't know what I would have done if he died. 'What the doctors and paramedics did was truly amazing I can't thank them enough if it was not for them my son would not be here.' Thankful: Kai with Jemma Varela and Dr Richard Lyon who helped save his life after a rare condition caused him to have a heart attack aged just two . Kai's disorder causes the heart muscles to become unusually thick. It triggered him to develop the condition Ventricular Fibrillation at his home in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex on October 17 2011. The disorder, which causes the heart to beat in a severely abnormal rhythm, is rare in adults and almost unheard of in children. The muscles in the lower chamber of the heart begin to randomly twitch which causes blood to stay in the heart when it should be pumped around the body. Following the attack his distraught parents rang 999 and the East of England ambulance service were called to the scene. Miracle: Helicopter paramedic Jemma Varela (left) and Dr Richard Lyon (right) with three-year-old Kai Clark and his family, mother Kelly Clark and father Philip Clark, brother nine-year-old Josh and baby Caitlin . A team of paramedics rushed to the youngster's side and managed to resuscitate him. The East Anglian Air Ambulance Service were then called and put Kai into an induced coma, before flying him to Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambs. He was later transferred to Great Ormond Street Hospital, London. The youngster was kept in hospital for five weeks and treated by specialist medical staff. Doctor Rich Lyon who treated Kai on his way to hospital said: 'It is very rare for such a young child to have a heart attack. 'I have never ever heard of such a young child suffering from Ventricular Fibrillation it is incredibly rare. 'In fact Kai has become somewhat of a medical mystery. It's fantastic to see Kai doing so well.' During the emotional reunion at Cambridge Airport Kai along with his father Phillip, 42, and siblings Josh and Kaitlin met members of the East Anglian Air Ambulance Service. While he was there the youngster was given the tour of the helicopter that saved his life and was allowed to play in the cockpit.",Kai suffers from heart condition almost unheard of among children .
"By . Rob Cooper . Last updated at 10:30 AM on 21st February 2012 . A failed Algerian asylum seeker who has been in Britain for 18 years is demanding £50,000 compensation - claiming that he was 'illegally detained' for almost a year. Abdel Zahali, 53, was jailed after threatening to set himself on fire in front of an MP and was held for 11 months at the end of his sentence under Home Office rules. Now he is suing the Home Secretary claiming that holding him after his prison term breached his human rights because of the effect it had on his mental health. It is not known how he is funding his claim - although it is likely he is receiving legal aid. Fire: Zahali threatened to torch himself in front of Labour MP Louise Ellman and is now suing Home Secretary Theresa May for £50,000 . After arriving in Britain on the back . of a lorry in 1994, Zahali has fought to stay in the country but lost a . succession of appeals. The Algerian, who worked for the Government in his homeland, claims he faces persecution if he returns. As . he battled to remain in Britain, he threatened to set fire to himself . in front of Liverpool MP Louise Ellman in her constituency office in . December 2009. A judge told him he must serve 10 months behind bars after he pleaded guilty to affray. The court was told that the politician had sympathy with him and he acted out of desperation. More than £12million was paid out in legal costs and compensation to asylum seekers and other immigrants last year, figures have showed. The UK Border Agency (UKBA) paid a total of £14.2million last year in compensation, legal costs and ex gratia payments, up almost £2million on the previous year, the agency's annual report for 2010/11 showed. This included payments to families who were unlawfully detained and removed, as well as £175,000 in compensation to an asylum seeker who was unlawfully detained and injured while in custody. Legal costs alone topped £7.7million in just over 1,000 cases, compared with £3.8million for 691 cases in 2009/10. He went on hunger strike while being held at HMP Liverpool. After he had completed his sentence he remained at the jail, detained under home office rules. The Home Secretary then transferred him to Colnbrook Immigration Removals Centre in June 2010. He was put under hourly observations . because of a suicide risk, and then moved to the vulnerable prisoners . unit where he tried to hang himself. He was eventually given immigration bail in January 2011 after a psychiatrist said he was depressed and was having suicidal thoughts. Zahali claims the Home Secretary . failed to follow Home Office guidelines when detaining him. The Algerian, who lives in Edgware, London, argues he has been falsely . imprisoned, and he should only have been . detained in very exceptional circumstances. He claims that he was subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment - because being detained made his depression worse. His solicitors have filed a writ at the High Court and he is demanding up to £50,000 in damages. A Home Office spokesperson said: 'Every detention decision is made on a case by case basis. The UK Border Agency has no wish to detain people for any longer than necessary. 'We do not routinely comment on individual cases.'","Abdel Zahali claims almost a year in a detention centre 'breached his Human Rights'

The latest test version of Microsoft's upcoming Windows 8 software is missing one crucial button - the Start button and menu, an iconic part of Microsoft's operating system since it was introduced in Windows 95. The button evolved to become the operating system's 'launchpad', offering access to software, files and search functions. Earlier test versions of Windows 8 had flattened the recognisable 'orb' - but the new build removes it altogether, according to leaked screenshots from tech site The Verge. Microsoft has not announced a release date for the new operating system, built to work with touchscreens as well as on conventional PCs, but it's widely expected to release in the second half of this year. The leaked screenshots are from a preview version of the upcoming Windows 8, and show that Microsoft has removed the iconic Start button . Windows XP's Start button: The button was first introduced in Windows 95, and evolved to become the 'launchpad' for applications, access to the hard drive and search functions . 'Fear not though, the Start button functionality isn't as dead as it seems,' reports The Verge. Although the button itself might be absent, the functions are still there, just accessed via a 'hot corner' designed to work equally well with touchscreens or computer mice. 'We have confirmed with sources close to Microsoft's Windows 8 development that a hot corner has replaced the Start button orb,' says The Verge. 'A thumbnail-like user interface will appear in Metro or desktop mode, providing a consistent way to access the Windows desktop and Start Screen in Windows 8 regardless of touch or mouse input .

German cars have out-muscled their Japanese rivals to become the best-value models on Britain’s roads, according to motoring experts. Volkswagen and BMW models led the way among vehicles that cost drivers the least over a three-year period – a list usually dominated by Japanese brands. Although they have long been envied for their engineering, design and luxury, German cars are rarely considered cheap to buy or to run. Driving a bargain: A table of the best-value cars in ten categories, according to analysis by What Car? magazine . But analysis by the magazine What Car? found German-owned marques topped seven out of the ten categories for . being the best value for money. The . data takes into account the ‘best purchase price’ which is achieved . after haggling with a dealer as opposed to the price on the ticket, and . how much the car can be sold for after three years. It then works out the running costs over the three years of ownership, including tax, parts, servicing, insurance and fuel. In . the ten categories, three were topped by VW brands, with the Passat . named best-value family car, the Golf in the estate category and the . Scirocco top coupe. Leading the way: The Volkswagen Passat is the most cost-effective family car, according to the new study . Top deal: VW also came up trumps in the coupe category with the Scirocco, which costs around £15,700 to run over a three-year period . The Octavia from VW-owned Skoda was . named the best-value small family car. BMW scored two successes under . its own badge with the 5 Series named best-value executive car and the . £31,000 X3 as the best-value sports utility vehicle. The BMW-owned Mini One Convertible was named as the best-value convertible. The . other two categories saw the £7,000 Hyundai i10 named as best-value . city car and the Ford Fiesta 1.25i as the top supermini. The . magazine said: ‘The i10 is one of the best city cars out there, and . it’s also one of the cheapest to buy and run. It doesn’t get much better . than that for buyers on a budget.’ Easier on the wallet: The BMW 5-Series, which costs £28,000 to buy and a further £21,000 to run for three years, was named the best-value executive car . Maximum value: The BMW-owned Mini One Convertible was judged the cheapest open-top model to keep . At the other end of the scale, the most expensive winner was the BMW X3 which can cost £42,000 with all the extras. The What Car? findings are the latest triumph for German cars over their Japanese rivals. The . VW Up also won What Car? overall Car of the Year for 2012 last month . and Audi, Porsche and Mercedes were winners in their various classes.

A woman has described how a Polish farm worker tried to rip out her heart 'like one of his pigs' after he stabbed her in the chest. Christine Seymour recounted the horrifying moment she felt Andrzej Chranowski push his hands inside her knife wound in an apparent attempt to tear out her vital organ. Chranowski, 34, claimed to be suffering from a 'short-term psychotic episode' when he pounced on Miss Seymour with a pair of surgical scissors. After stabbing her, he then carried the 59-year-old into her rented property and dumped her on her bed shouting: . 'Just lie there and die.' Miraculously, Miss Seymour survived the brutal attack after life-saving surgery. Polish pig worker Chranowski was this week jailed for 18 years for her attempted murder. Chranowski lived in the same rented three-storey house as Miss Seymour, in Spalding, Lincolnshire. Two others also lived there. He lunged at her as she talked with a friend on the phone outside the property. Miss Seymour was conscious throughout the terrifying ordeal and described, in sickening detail, how she thought her heart was about to be ripped out. She told Nottingham Crown Court: 'It was like a living nightmare. 'I felt a pain and something warm. The next thing I remember I was on the floor, my head was laid up against the wall. 'I felt a huge pressure on my chest, . like a knee drop, and put my hands up because I couldn't breathe. I felt . something was ripping across my chest, it felt like somebody's fingers . were going across my chest. Caged: Chranowski was jailed for 18 years following a trial at Nottingham Crown Court (pictured) 'I got the impression, as he worked . with pigs, that he thought I was one. It just felt like he was trying to . rip through to my heart, I just thought he was trying to rip my heart . out. 'I felt something was ripping across my chest, it felt like somebody's fingers were going across my chest.' Police arrested Chranowski inside . Miss Seymour's room after they were alerted by other residents in the . shared property during the incident last February. Michael Cranmer-Brown, prosecuting, . said that when officers entered the room Chranowski calmly asked for a . cigarette and confessed, 'I've just killed a woman with this,' still . holding the scissors. He added: 'Miss Seymour was lying on her bed in a pool of blood. You could see the blood pumping inside her chest.' Ms . Seymour suffered horrendous injuries including a two-inch deep cut to . her chest. The scissors missed her heart by a centimetre. She also suffered a collapsed lung and only survived after life-saving surgery at the Pilgrim Hospital, Boston. Weapon: Miss Seymour was attacked with a pair of surgical scissors . She also suffered severe psychological effects and is currently undergoing trauma counselling. Chranowski, from Spalding, had denied attempted murder on February 2, 2011, but was found guilty by a jury after a trial. He was also convicted of wounding another resident with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm. Passing sentence at Nottingham Crown Court, Judge John Milmo QC said: 'This was wholly unprovoked attack with a potentially lethal weapon. 'It is quite clear that your conduct has had a lasting effect on Christine Seymour.' During the trial Chranowski, described in court as a normally quiet man, claimed that Ms Seymour was stabbed by a mystery man and he claimed he was innocent. He had no previous convictions in either England or his native Poland although he had what was described as 'petty theft' offences committed while working in Germany. His barrister Paul Mytton said it appeared Chranowski was suffering from a 'short term psychotic episode.' when he carried out the attack.","Christine Seymour recounted horrifying moment she felt attacker push his hands into her chest .

A father yesterday told how his family was ‘broken’ by the death of their two-year-old daughter after she trapped her neck in the cord of a window blind. Two-year-old Emily Warner was left paralysed and suffered brain damage. She died months later following breathing and heart problems. Tragic: Emily Warner who died after she was accidentally hanged by a window blind cord at her home in Royston, Hertfordshire . Emily's father Jamie Warner, 30, has launched a campaign with his family against unsafe blind cords (left) and Emily, with her grandfather Graham Warner (right), after the accident when she was left brain damaged for three months . The inquest at Hatfield Coroner's Court heard Emily's father Jamie Warner found the two-year-old unconscious in her bedroom . Speaking after an inquest yesterday her father Jamie, 30, said: ‘Emmie was the light of our lives, such a wonderful little girl. ‘There is no one thing that is responsible, it was an accident. We didn’t see any danger because we weren’t looking.’ The little girl had been put to bed, . but stood up on the end of her bed-frame and was climbing across her . window sill when the accident happened. Mr Warner found her hanging unconscious on her tiptoes when he walked past her room a few minutes later. He attempted to resuscitate her as his wife called an ambulance. The tragedy happened on the evening of August 27 last year at the family home in Royston, Hertfordshire. Emily remained in a coma in hospital . for a week. When she came round she was left unable to walk, talk or . feed herself because her brain had been starved of oxygen. Two-year-olds Arthur Winfield  (pictured above) and Emily Warner died following similar accidents over the past few months. Both the families have launched a safety campaign to warn other families of the dangers. Arthur's . father Oli, who lives in Markyate, Hertfordshire, said: 'You always . think your home is going to be a safe place, especially for your . children. 'We are totally . devastated at the loss of our precious boy and urge people to take heed . of the safety messages being made available through this campaign.' Arthur's accident was in the morning of Thursday, January 5, when he was in his bedroom. He died at Great Ormond Street Hospital in the early hours of Tuesday, January 10. An inquest has not taken place yet. Despite doctors observing on the . previous day that she was improving, she died in hospital following . breathing problems and a heart attack on December 1. At least 19 children have died since . 1999 in similar circumstances to Emily’s. Yesterday, Hertfordshire . Coroner’s Court heard how Mr Warner and his wife  Tracey, who also have a . four-year-old son, James, could ‘have done nothing more’. A verdict of accidental death was recorded. Speaking after the accident, but . before Emily’s death, Mr Warner said: ‘James had been naughty so he had . been sent to bed at the same time as Emily. ‘When I went to tell him off for . making a noise, I checked in on her. Then I saw her hanging by the . window. If James hadn’t been sent to bed early I might not have gone to . check on her in time.’ The hearing comes after toddler . Arthur Winfield, also two, had a similar accident with a blind cord in . his bedroom in Markyate, Hertfordshire, on January 5. He died in . hospital five days later. Since the tragedy, the Warners have . helped to promote the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents and . British Blind and Shutter Association’s Make It Safe campaign. It is . calling for improvements to safety standards in blinds, such as . chain-break connections, to prevent further deaths. The couple told how the day after the accident they replaced all their vertical blinds with net curtains. Mr Warner, who works for a chemical . manufacturer said: ‘We don’t want other families to suffer in the way we . have. 'By taking some simple steps with your blinds you can protect your . children.’ Coroner Edward Thomas told the Warners: ‘This is so awful. I applaud you for trying to help other people.’","Blind's loop string had got tangled around toddler Emily Warner's neck .

An angry jilted husband shot dead his unarmed ex-wife outside a Hilton hotel where she had been staying with her new boyfriend, a court heard. Jerry Hudson, 51, of Bolingbrook, Illinois, allegedly murdered Melissa Bridgewater outside the $240-a-night hotel on New Year’s Day in 2010. He phoned her 20 times in the 90 minutes before her death, rammed her car and shot her six times - with two bullets in the head, prosecutors said. Charged: Jerry Hudson, 51, of Bolingbrook, Illinois, allegedly murdered Melissa Bridgewater, 45, outside a hotel near Chicago on New Year's Day in 2010 . ‘This is not a case of who done it,’ John Lyke Jr, defending, told DuPage County Court, arguing self-defence. ‘This is a case of why did he do it.’ The shooting happened more than two years ago at 6:20am in the car park of the DoubleTree Hilton Hotel in the Chicago suburb of Oak Brook. Hudson allegedly hit her vehicle with his Hyundai rental car to stop her leaving, after making the phone calls, reported the Chicago Sun-Times. He shot the 45-year-old six times and drove off but a picture of his car was snapped by a nearby toll camera, Mary Cronin, prosecuting, told the court. Dead: Jerry Hudson claimed Melissa Bridgewater, 45, pictured, owned a handgun and had previously told him she 'wasn't afraid to use it', his lawyer said . Hudson claims he shot when he thought she was reaching to pull out a pistol inside her Acura car. But no gun was found in the vehicle. 'This is not a case of who done it. This is a case of why did he do it' John Lyke Jr, defending . However he claimed she owned a handgun and had previously told him she ‘wasn’t afraid to use it’, Mr Lyke told the court. He had left a letter at home saying he was angry Ms Bridgewater, who divorced him in 2006, did not want to get back together, Ms Cronin said. The couple still dated despite their divorce and Hudson was humiliated when he found out she was with someone else, prosecutors said. Stay: Ms Bridgewater was celebrating New Year's at the $240-a-night DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel in Oak Brook, Illinois, with her new boyfriend . ‘Melissa took my manhood, so I’m taking her with me,’ the letter allegedly said. Hudson surrendered to police four days after the shooting. 'If she took his manhood, it’s a petty theft. Not one that warranted six bullet holes' Mary Cronin, prosecuting . ‘If she took his manhood, it’s a petty theft,’ Ms Cronin said, reported the Chicago Tribune. ‘Not one that warranted six bullet holes.’ Ms Bridgewater was celebrating New Year’s at the hotel with her boyfriend Marvin Durr, who was also marking his birthday, the court heard. The top rate for a two-person bedroom at the hotel for New Year's Eve this year is $510 including tax, but rates are up to $240 for a normal day. Hudson, a former truck driver, is charged with first-degree murder. The case continues on Thursday in front of Judge Daniel Guerin.","Jerry Hudson, 51, 'murdered' Melissa Bridgewater .

An eight-year-old girl was fighting for her life today after being shot when a gun brought into her school inside a classmate's backpack discharged. Washington youngster Amina Kocer-Bowman was in a critical condition in hospital after having surgery on a bullet wound in her stomach, authorities said. A fellow third-grade boy is being held at Kitsap County juvenile detention centre on suspicion of unlawful possession of a gun, bringing a dangerous weapon to school and third-degree assault. Scroll down for video . Victim: Amina Kocer-Bowman was accidentally shot in the abdomen when the gun that was inside another student's backpack went off and hit her . Critical: Amina's mother was already on her way to pick her daughter up from school when she learned of the shooting, and shortly after that the 8-year-old girl was airlifted to a Seattle Hospital where she had surgery . Detectives believe the incdent at Armin Jahr Elementary in Bremerton, near Seattle, was accidental and are trying to establish how the boy got the gun. The Bremerton Schools superintendent's office said the girl was shot in the abdomen. KING-TV reported that her friends and relatives gave a 'thumbs up' signal to reporters as they left the Harborview Medical Center late yesterday. Lori Morsette, a friend of victim's family, said: 'She is a sweet little girl and I don't know what to do. I'm trying to be supportive for my friends, I'm trying to be there for them.' Horror: Kiomi Pavlock, 12, hugs her dad James as a friend shows her anguish over the incident. The school went into lockdown yesterday, but is expected to re-open today . Distress: Kiomi Pavlock (left) and another pupil (right) weep outside school as they collected by their parents . Distraught: Savannah Anderson, 13, hugs her little sister Kaylee, 10, after arriving in the school's gymnasium to take her home following the shooting yesterday . The school is in a quiet residential neighborhood about 20 miles west of Seattle, across Puget Sound. Fisher said officers and emergency crews were dispatched to the school around 1.30pm yesterday in response to a call that a student was shot by another pupil. The school went into lockdown immediately after the shooting, said Bremerton Schools spokeswoman Patty Glaser. Such procedures call for announcements to be made over the school's loudspeakers and for teachers to lock their classrooms, she said. Parents picked up their children later in the afternoon. Probe: The third-grade boy who allegedly brought the gun into school is being held at a juvenile detention centre on suspicion of illegally possessing a firearm and third-degree assault . Worried: A police officer offers reassurances to a pupil as the investigation into the shooting continues . Emergency: A police officer stands watch by the entrance to Armin Jahr Elementary School in Washington, where eight-year-old Amina Kocer-Bowman was shot when a gun discharged inside a boy's backpack . Armin Jahr Elementary has about 400 students, Glaser said. She said the school would reopen today and three counsellors would be available to talk to teachers, students and parents. 'Our plans at this time, school will continue as usual,' Glaser said. Many questions remained. Police did not immediately describe the gun involved. In the latest scorecard by the Brady Campaign, a national gun control advocacy group, Washington scored no points in the child safety category because the state does not require trigger locks for guns and lacks laws to prevent child access to firearms. 'Washington state is a loosely regulated state when it comes to firearms,' said Gregory Roberts, executive director of Washington Cease Fire, a Brady Campaign affiliate. Amanda Roth, a staff attorney for the San Francisco-based Legal Community Against Violence, said 27 states and the District of Columbia have some form of firearm child access prevention laws. Such laws can include requirements to use gun locks and criminal penalties for adults who allow children to get their hands on guns. WATCH VIDEOS HERE .

James Holmes Jr has taken legal action against the Las Vegas based Andre Agassi Academy claiming he was fired because he was black. The biology teacher claims he was singled out because of his colour and suffered prejudicial treatment. A teacher at a school founded by tennis legend Andre Agassi, seen here with wife Steffi Graf earlier this week, claims he was the victim of racism . According to his lawsuit Holmes said . his problems began in 2008 three years after joining the school to teach . 9th and 10th grade students biology. He said the new principal favored white teachers and he found his role increasingly marginalized. Holmes . says in legal papers that he was refused permission to travel to a . science conference while other white teachers were allowed to attend. James also claimed the principal denied his request for new lab materials due to budget restraints but he later found out the lab materials were ordered for two white teachers instead. According to the suit, James said he filed a complaint with the school but was sacked and replaced by an elementary school teacher who was not certified to take science classes. Agassi founded the tuition free school in 2001 in Las Vegas to help at risk children and boasts a high graduation rate . He is demanding at least $75,000, according to TMZ.com . Former Wimbledon champion Agassi, 41, opened the Andre Agassi College Preparatory Academy in 2001. The school, which is tuition free, recruits at risk children in the Las Vegas area. It has one of the best graduation rates among schools in the Vegas area. The school has been such a success that Agassi, who is married to Steffi Graff, is considering opening other academies across the US. A spokesman for the Las Vegas Academy said they will contest the lawsuit by Holmes. A spokesman said: 'We will aggressively defend the suit because the case is baseless and without any merit.'",The tuition-free Andre Agassi Academy takes at risk children in the Las Vegas area .

A husband has been forced to issue a grovelling apology to his estranged wife every day for 30 days on Facebook after posting a furious message about her on the social networking site. In leaving the hate-filled rant, Mark Byron breached a court order protecting his wife, Elizabeth, and their son after he was convicted of civil domestic violence against her last year. According to court records, he said: 'If you are an evil, vindictive woman who wants to ruin your husband's life and take your son's father away from him completely - all you need to do is say that you're scared of your husband or domestic partner and they'll take him away!' Held to account: Mark Byron (above) has been told to leave a grovelling apology to his estranged wife on Facebook or face 60 days in prison . The Cincinnati photographer also posted a . picture of his son, Jonathon, which Mrs Byron somehow saw, along with comments . from friends, even though she was blocked from the page, he said. Magistrate Paul Meyers ruled last . month Byron had violated the protection order preventing him from . 'causing plaintiff or the child of the parties to suffer physical and/or . mental abuse, harassment, annoyance or bodily injury.' He . has now been told he must leave a lengthy message expressing his . penitence on his Facebook page for 30 days or face 60 days in prison and $500 fine, it . was reported on WLWT.com.

Breach: The photo Byron posted of him and his son, Jonathon, on Facebook which his wife saw even though he claims she was blocked from his page . Speaking to WLWT.com, Byron said he left the original message in frustration over his impending divorce and child visitation. 'I post on Facebook to vent things,' he said yesterday. I liken it to having a drink in a bar with a friend . and telling them how I feel. 'On . one hand, the court wants to stop me from saying something on Facebook, . then it's telling me I have to (post) the pre-written apology.' Byron, . who claims his wife painted an unfair picture of him in a domestic . relations court, must also pay back outstanding child support in order . to avoid the jail term. 'I would like to apologize to my wife, Elizabeth Byron, for the comments regarding her and our son ... which were posted on my Facebook wall on or about November 23, 2011. 'I hereby acknowledge that two judicial officials in the Hamilton County Domestic Relations Court have heard evidence and determined that I committed an act of domestic violence against Elizabeth on January 17, 2011. 'While that determination is currently being appealed, it has not been overturned by the appellate court. 'As a result of that determination, I was granted supervised parenting time with (my son) on a twice weekly basis. 'The reason I saw (my son) only one time during the four-month period which ended about the time of my Facebook posting was because I chose to see him on only that single occasion during that period. 'I hereby apologize to Elizabeth for casting her in an unfavorable light by suggesting that she withheld (my son) from me or that she in any manner prevented me from seeing (my son) during that period. That decision was mine and mine alone.

"By . Simon Tomlinson . Last updated at 8:02 AM on 24th February 2012 . For most men, shaving is nothing more than an insignificant part of their daily routine. But for face transplant patient Ugur Acar, the simple act of removing his facial hair marks a defining moment in his progress. These pictures show the moment the Turkish teenager was given his first shave at Akdeniz University's School of Medicine in Antalya since his successful operation to repair his face. Defining moment: Turkish teenager Ugur Acar gets his first shave since his face transplant operation . Great job: Mr Acar admires his cleanly shave face after having his beard removed earlier this month . The 19-year-old had been forced to grow a beard in the weeks after the procedure, the first of its kind in the country, to avoid irritating the skin. He was then freshly shaven for the first time two weeks ago - and was impressed with the result. He gave a press conference to update media on his condition earlier this week and was due to stay in hospital for a further two or three weeks. 'I give thanks to all my doctors. It couldn't be better,' he said earlier this month. Mr Acar said he hopes to get married one day. Grateful: The 19-year-old thanked his doctors for repairing his face, which was badly burned in a house fire when he was a baby . However, doctors have warned him that he cannot make facial expressions for another six months. Dr Omer Ozkan told him: 'Don't do any mimics as nerve healing will take six months. 'You will laugh, cry and get angry after six months, OK?' Doctors successfully transplanted tissue from the face of a 45-year-old donor to Mr Acar. Now and then: Mr Acar after his operation (left) and (right) with the burns to his face sustained during the fire when he was just 40 days old .

Israfil Kurtcepe, rector of the university hospital, said specialists will be at hand if he needs any support. He said: 'Ugur was prepared for this process, and everything went well. 'He didn't need psychiatric or psychological care. We were just there for him to make sure that he didn't need any psychiatric assistance. 'We will continue to be there for him, and we will help him adopt his new life and talk with him about his personal problems, if there are any.'

Increase: The number of weight loss operations - including gastric bands - has risen by 12 per cent (posed by model) The number of weight loss operations has risen 12 per cent while hospital admissions for obesity have also jumped. In 2010/11, there were 8,087 weight-loss stomach operations in England’s hospitals, up from 7,214 in 2009/10, according to data from the NHS Information Centre. The report highlights around a 30-fold increase in the number of people going under the knife in the last decade, from just 261 weight loss operations in 2000/01. Recent figures include operations to . adjust an existing gastric band rather than fit a new one. Of the 8,087 . procedures in 2010/11, 1,444 were for maintenance of an existing band. Bariatric weight-loss surgery includes stomach stapling, gastric bypasses and a procedure called sleeve gastrectomy - partial or full surgical removal of the stomach. Today’s report also found a dramatic rise in the number of hospital admissions for patients whose main diagnosis was obesity. Over the last decade, these admissions have risen from 1,054 in 2000/01 to 11,574 in 2010/11. Admissions among women are almost three times higher than for men (8,654 in 2010/11 compared to 2,919 for men). The . North East has the highest rate of admissions with a primary diagnosis . of obesity (40 per 100,000 of the population), followed by the East . Midlands (36 per 100,000) and London (35 per 100,000). The South West, South central and North West have the lowest rates, with 14 admissions for every 100,000 people. Weight-loss . surgery was most common in the East Midlands (32 procedures for every . 100,000 people) and least common in the North West (six per 100,000). TV's Fern Britton was famously forced to admit she'd had a gastric band operation. Now more and more Britons are opting to go under the knife . The figure in the east of England and south central regions was nine procedures for every 100,000 population. Chief executive of the NHS Information Centre Tim Straughan said: 'The report charts the growing impact of obesity on both people’s health and NHS resources. It also examines changes in physical activity and diet. 'Those working in this field may want to examine closely the findings of the report, including the significant regional variations that appear to exist in both the admissions for obesity and those for weight-loss stomach surgery.' Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, said: 'The regional variations in admissions and surgery are very concerning. 'Having examined the variations, the Forum believes that they illustrate a postcode lottery which still exists in England. 'It is deplorable. 'Some Primary Care Trusts abide by National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice) guidance in offering bariatric operation to obese patients but others flout it by making it virtually impossible to qualify for the surgery.' A Department of Health spokesman said: 'We want people to live healthier lives so they do not need to resort to surgery. 'We are working with charities, local government and industry to make it easier for people to make better choices.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 9:48 AM on 24th February 2012 . Teenagers are more susceptible to cocaine addiction than adults because of how their brains are wired, scientists say. A team from Yale University said those who started abusing the Class A drug when they were young were far more easily affected by it and more likely to become dependent. Brain altering: Scientists have found out why teenagers are so susceptible to the effects of cocaine . Writing in The Journal of Neuroscience, the researchers said this was because the adolescent brain launches a strong defensive reaction to minimise the drug's effect, with neurons and synapses changing shape when first exposed to the cocaine. Because of this, teenagers needs only a third as much of the drug to experience a high. The researchers have now found the gene which regulates this response - and by changing it have dramatically increased the sensitivity of mice to cocaine, reports the Journal of Neuroscience. Tweaking it in the opposite direction could reverse the effect, they say. Prof Anthony Koleske said the gene, integrin beta1, is crucial to the development of the nervous system in vertebrates. He said: 'This suggests that these structural changes observed are probably protective of the neurocircuitry, an effort of the neuron to protect itself when first exposed to cocaine.' When researchers knocked out the gene pathway, mice needed approximately three times less cocaine to induce behavioural changes than mice with an intact pathway. Prof Kolesek said it suggested that the relative strength of the integrin beta1 pathway may explain why some cocaine users end up addicted to the drug while others escape its worst effects. He said: 'If you were to become totally desensitised to cocaine, there is no reason to seek the drug.' Cocaine is a Class A drug, which is illegal to possess, give away or sell. Almost one in 10 Britons aged 15-64 have taken cocaine (and one in seven aged 15-34) - the highest in Europe. It was responsible for 282 deaths between 2004 and 2007. It is a stimulant with a powerful, but very short-lived, effect. This can lead to over-confidence and risky behaviour. The white powder is also known as coke, charlie and snow. It raises the body’s temperature, makes the heart beat faster and can stave off feelings of hunger. A drugs session can be followed by a depressed mood and flu-like symptoms. Cocaine is very addictive as users start to crave their next hit. It can create a strong psychological dependence due to the changes it causes in the brain.",Scientists investigated why youngsters were so much more sensitive to the Class A drug .
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 7:53 AM on 24th February 2012 . A man accused of murdering his wife on their honeymoon and making it look like a scuba-diving accident was acquitted today after the judge in his trial threw out the case. Circuit Judge Tommy . Nail issued his ruling before the defence had even presented its case in . the two-week-long trial of Gabe Watson, and before jurors were given the case to . deliberate. Mr Watson, 34, . had faced a sentence of life in prison without parole if convicted of . murdering his wife, Tina Thomas Watson, in 2003. Acquitted: Gabe Watson has walked free after a case accusing him of murdering his wife Tina was thrown out by a judge on the grounds that the prosecution had presented insufficient grounds for conviction . Joy: Mr Watson hugs his new wife Kim soon after being acquitted of killing his first wife Tina . New life: Gabe and Kim Watson, pictured at the end of the trial, married in August 2008 . He has already served 18 . months in an Australian prison after pleading guilty there to a . manslaughter charge involving negligence. Mr Nail . agreed with defence arguments that prosecutors failed to show Mr Watson . intentionally killed the woman. Prosecutors claimed he drowned her for . insurance money, but the only eyewitness testified that he thought Mr Watson was . trying to save the woman. The state's evidence was 'sorely lacking' and did not prove Mr Watson had any financial motive, according to the judge in the trial in Birmingham, Alabama. 'I . don't think anyone knows for sure what happened in the water down . there,' Mr Nail said. He repeatedly clashed with prosecutors during both the . trial and earlier hearings. Prosecutor Don Valeska said he had never . before had a trial end in a judge's acquittal in 41 years of trying . cases. Scuba: This photograph, showing Mrs Watson lying dead in the background, was presented as evidence . Relief: Mr Watson embraces his defence team after the verdict was announced as prosecutor Don Valeska, left, and the accused's father-in-law Tommy Thomas, right, walk past . Defence attorneys . had argued that Mr Watson did not stand to gain anything monetarily because . Tina Watson's father was the beneficiary of her life insurance policy. They contended her death was an accident. Gabe Watson's . father, David, hugged his son in the courtroom after the judge made his . ruling. He said every court that had looked at the case determined Gabe . did not intentionally kill his wife. 'I'm just so relieved. Hopefully he can put his life back together,' David Watson said. 'I hope everyone can begin to heal. The rest of his life will determine his legacy. Gabe is a good kid.' Gabe Watson left the courtroom hand-in-hand with his second wife, Kim, without commenting to reporters. Tina . Watson's father, Tommy Thomas, had testified earlier in the day. He . described how his family's grief and shock over Tina Watson's death . turned to suspicion of Gabe Watson. Free: Mr Watson, pictured arriving for the last day of his trial with his new wife Kim, has been acquitted . Dismissed: Judge Tommy Nail, left, threw out the case despite prosecution testimony today from Mrs Watson's father Tommy Thomas, pictured right at the stand . Prosecutor Mr Valeska walked with his arm around Mr Thomas, who appeared to be in shock and stunned by the judge's decision. 'It should have gone to the jury for them to decide,' Mr Thomas said of the judge's decision. Shortly after the death, Mr Thomas testified, his wife Cindy was worried about Mr Watson's condition. But evidence showed relations between Mr Watson and his wife's . family frayed quickly as the Thomases began having doubts about what . happened and Mr Watson started asking for Mrs Watson's belongings. However, the judge did not allow Mr Thomas to testify that his daughter . told him her husband has asked her to increase the value of her life . insurance. Mr Nail described the claim as hearsay and said it would be inadmissible as evidence. Happiness: Gabe and Tina Watson on their wedding day in 2003 - 11 days before Mrs Watson drowned during a honeymoon diving trip . Mr Watson was accused of turning off his wife's air supply and trying to cash in on her death, but the judge questioned his motive for the alleged crime earlier this week. The prosecution called the director of the funeral home which handled Mrs Watson's death to testify that her husband had removed her engagement ring before she was buried. But Mr Nail then ordered the jury out of the courtroom and proceeded to question the prosecutor's argument that this showed a greed motive in the alleged killing. 'You mean to tell me that [Gabe Watson] bought the engagement ring, married her, he and his family paid for a wedding, he planned and paid for a honeymoon halfway around the world, all so he could kill her to get an engagement ring he bought in the first place?' the judge asked. Mr Nail's scepticism reflected the increasing fragility of the prosecution argument in the light of the failure to find a convincing motive for the alleged killing so soon after what seemed a harmonious wedding. Montre Carodine, a law professor at the University of Alabama, said the judge's decision to end the trial without the defence even presenting evidence was a 'serious indictment' of the prosecution's case, particularly considering it was a capital trial.","Gabe Watson walks free after judge decides there was insufficient evidence that he killed his bride Tina to send the case to a jury .

Tortured: Savannah Hardin, nine, died of extreme dehydration after allegedly being forced to run for three hours as a punishment for lying . The woman accused of 'running to death' her nine-year-old stepdaughter - who died of extreme dehydration - gave birth the same day she was arrested. Joyce Hardin . Garrard, 46, and 27-year-old Jessica Mae Hardin, from Alabama, were charged with the murder of Savannah Hardin yesterday, who they made run without stop for three hours as punishment for lying about eating a candy bar. Hardin was transferred from the Etowah County Detention Center to a hospital where she is currently under guard after giving birth hours after she was arrested. It is unclear whether the baby is a boy or girl. Roger Simpson, who lives up the hill . from the double-wide trailer where Savannah lived with Jessica and her . father Robert Hardin, said he saw the girl running in the yard. When emergency vehicles arrived at the home hours later, he said he thought they were there for the pregnant Jessica. Alabama law requires people who are . arrested to be informed of the charges against them in an initial . appearance within 72 hours. Barton said Jessica Hardin's hearing will . likely be held once she is released from the hospital. The Alabama Department of Human . Resources has been called in to create a safety plan for Jessica's . newborn, as well as the couple's three-year-old son, Harp said. The older child has been placed with a . relative, and the plan is for the infant to be given to the same . relative when it leaves the hospital. Speak said he could not reveal . with whom the children were placed. Savannah had a bladder condition . common to young girls that meant she shouldn't have chocolate because of . the caffeine content, Harp said. He said there is no evidence that the . condition contributed to her death. Authorities say Savannah was forced . to run in the afternoon of Friday, February 17. At around 6:45pm Jessica . called 911, telling dispatchers Savannah was having a seizure and was . unresponsive. The girl was taken to Children's Hospital in Birmingham where she was kept on life support while Robert Hardin, a contractor with the U.S. State Department, took eight flights to return to Alabama. Robert Hardin made the decision to pull Savannah off life support, and she died on Monday.

Her death was ruled a . homicide by a state pathologist and preliminary reports show she was . extremely dehydrated and had a very low sodium level - a chemical . necessary to prevent seizures and dehydration. Harp said he may pursue capital . murder charges, which carry a possible death sentence. He said his . office is interviewing neighbors who had seen Savannah running and . expects to have a decision on the charges in a day or two. The district attorney said he was not . aware of any defense attorneys for the two women. He said in their . initial appearance they will be advised of the charges against them and . offered a public defender. Bond for Garrard and Jessica Hardin is set at $500,000 each. Sheriff Todd Entrekin told the . Birmingham News: 'It's sad when a family is grieving over the death of a . daughter and granddaughter and so soon to find out that the death could . have been prevented. 'My thoughts and prayers are with the family.' Garrard and Hardin were being held at the Etowah County Detention Center on $500,000 bail. Gail Denny and her husband Phil, live . just up a dirt road from the home. They've known the family since they . moved to the area in northeastern Alabama seven years ago. Concerns: Neighbours called the sheriff's office after witnessing what was happening to nine-year-old Savannah in the rural Carlisle community . The couple said they were used to seeing Savannah and other neighbourhood children out waiting on the school bus in the morning. Gail Denny said her grandson had a crush on Savannah. 'My grandson asked her to be his girlfriend on Valentine's Day, and she said 'yes,'"" she said before dissolving into tears. She left a candle and stuffed animal outside the girl's home Wednesday night, saying a prayer as she paused beside the road. The trailer where Savannah lived was surrounded by a wooden fence, playground equipment and toys. Neighbors say they never saw children playing in the yard. They said that Garrard owned a lot of property along the road and much of her family lived in homes on that property. 'It seems like a very happy extended family around here,' Denny said. 'There are mothers, grandmothers, kids. It sounds like a punishment that got out of hand.' Garrard and Jessica Mae Hardin are being held in the Etowah County Detention Center, each on a $500,000 cash bond. Court records show that Robert Hardin filed for divorce in August of 2010. In his complaint, he asserted his wife was bi-polar and had alcoholic tendencies. He accused her previously of having run off with the couple's own child. In her response, Jessica denied all of Robert's allegations. Five months after filing for divorce, the two asked a judge to dismiss their case.","Jessica Mae Hardin is now under guard in hospital .

"By . Ray Massey, Transport Editor . Last updated at 11:44 AM on 23rd February 2012 . Nearly half of pilots say they have fallen asleep at the controls, it emerged yesterday. The alarming admission came as union leaders warned MPs that even more passengers’ lives will be put at risk due to new European rules that could allow pilots to land their aircraft after 22 hours without sleep. The change – to ‘harmonise’ flying hours – poses ‘a danger to public safety’ and must not be adopted by the UK, the British Airline Pilots’ Association warned the House of Commons Transport Committee yesterday. The pilots' association, Balpa, fears air passengers will be put at risk if changes to their working arrangements are agreed . Its research claims that the . proposals will leave pilots ‘drunk with fatigue’ – as if they had . consumed five cans of lager and were four times over the legal limit for . flying. Balpa’s head of safety, Dr Rob Hunter, . told MPs that its own poll showed 43 per cent of pilots had fallen . asleep on the flight deck – but said this was ‘probably an . underestimation’. Asked if the EU changes would lead to more accidents, Dr Hunter replied: ‘I would say so.’ He added that competition among airlines was so intense it could lead to skimping on safety. ‘If airlines spend on safety today, they might go out of business tomorrow,’ he said. Balpa has said there are no guarantees that mandated rest time for pilots will mean they will get sleep . The pilots’ union is concerned that . the Civil Aviation Authority appears to be supporting the flying time . rules from the EU’s European Aviation Safety Agency when it should be . demanding an opt-out. Before the meeting, Balpa general . secretary Jim McAuslan said: ‘The Government have to answer this . question: “Is it safe to land an aircraft after 22 hours [without . sleep]?” If not, they need to reject these EU proposals now and keep the . current UK rules in place until they have been significantly improved.’ Fatigue was seen as factor in the crash which killed 49 people in Buffalo, upstate New York, in the U.S. three years ago. It emerged the co-pilot was paid a salary so low that she lived with her parents near Seattle and commuted across the country to her job, a combination of long travel and little money that a safety official called a ""recipe for an accident"". A National Transportation Safety Board hearing then focused on whether Captain Marvin Renslow and co-pilot Rebecca Shaw were fatigued on the wintry night of February 12, 2009, when they apparently made a series of critical errors as Continental Connection Flight 3407 approached Buffalo Niagara International Airport. The Bombardier Dash 8-Q400, a twin-engine turboprop, experienced an aerodynamic stall, rolling back and forth before plunging into a house below. All 49 people aboard and one on the ground were killed in the worst U.S. air crash in seven years. Mr McAuslan added: ‘Twenty hours of wakefulness is far from the only part of the proposals which give us serious concern. ‘Compared with the UK’s domestic . rules, the EU proposals would see pilots being able to fly further – as . far as California – with no back-up crew and, contrary to scientific . advice, allow pilots to do up to seven early starts in a row, which is . desperately fatiguing. ‘We need the Government to say it . won’t support this danger to public safety, and will demand that we . either get the proposals to a much safer position, or retain our own . domestic rules.’ Kris Major, of the Unite union, said the proposals would lead to a 17 per cent increase in pilots’ workloads. And there is a five-and-a-half times . higher chance of an accident when duty periods exceed 13 hours, . according to Jon Horne, executive board director of the European Cockpit . Association. But the Civil Aviation Authority rejected any suggestion that the controversial EU rules would compromise safety. Captain Tim Price, of British Airways, . insisted airlines were not  prioritising profits and that safety was . the responsibility of the airline and the captain flying on that . particular day. Aviation minister Theresa Villiers claimed there would be ‘significant safety gains’ from the European proposals. She  said the EU plans would . ‘broadly’ bring the whole of the continent up to UK levels and would not . see a ‘levelling down’ of standards.",Pilots fear new EU regulations would allow them to land a plane after up to 22 hours without sleep .

Victory: Sir Richard Branson, the Virgin boss, has won control of the web address richardbranson.xxx, after wrestling it from an Australian man who registered it as a 'souvenir' Sir Richard Branson, the Virgin boss, has won control of the web address richardbranson.xxx, after wrestling it from an Australian man who registered it as a 'souvenir.' The multi-millionaire took Sean Truman to the National Arbitration Forum, a body based in the United States that rules on web address disputes. It found that Mr Truman 'should have recognized that his registration and control of 'richardbranson.xxx' would serve to vex or embarrass' Sir Richard. 'Registering and holding a .xxx domain name identical to [Sir Richard’s] mark without having any rights or interests therein is evidence of bad faith registration and use,' it said in its ruling, reported The Telegraph. The dispute began when brand owners were invited to block . addresses based on their trademarks for a one-off fee, before .xxx . opened for general registrations last year. Decision: The .xxx designed as a internet home for porn sites, but the NAF found that because Mr Truman had no connection to the pornography industry that he 'impliedly admits in his papers that he has no rights in the domain name' On December 10, just four days after the .xxx domains were released, Sean Truman picked up and registered 'richardbranson.xxx' for a few dollars. He argued that he should be allowed to keep the address because the name Richard . Branson was 'neither unique nor unusual' and that Sir Richard had had 'ample opportunity' to register the address himself. The .xxx designed as a home for porn sites, but the NAF found that because Mr . Truman had no connection to the pornography industry that he 'impliedly admits in his papers that he has no rights in the domain . name.' The address served up 'parking page . with links to adult entertainment related websites', which Mr Truman . made no money from, reported The Telegraph. He protested that he had registered it simply as a 'souvenir.' The NAF said Sir Richard had provided evidence he had common law, . although not registered, rights to the trademark 'Richard Branson.' Under the rules of xxx, anyone . registering an address and actually using it rather than just protecting . their trademark must be involved in the pornography industry. But because Virgin is not a porn . company, and therefore does not qualify to register .xxx domains, . richardbranson.xxx will likely be set as a 'non-resolver' - it will not work when you type it in your browser address bars. It is the second case to have been . decided since .xxx first started selling domains last year - the first . saw the domain heb.xxx transferred to a Texas-based grocery chain. According . to records, other disputed addresses include foxstudios.xxx and . kayjewelers.xxx and there have been 13 cases filed since 29 December. Last March the.xxx domain . was introduced after nearly a decade of debates by The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), the . organisation in charge of the web’s address system. Pornography is often used to lure Web surfers to dangerous or fraudulent sites and through regulating .xxx, ICANN hoped to make things better. Anyone who wants to register a .xxx domain has to go through an application process that's approved by the International Foundation for Online Responsibility. The move gives consumers 'reassurance they are more protected from the risk of viruses, identity theft, credit card fraud and inadvertent exposure to child abuse images' ICANN said when announcing their decision last year. Critics said established porn sites are unlikely to give up their .com domains just because there's a .xxx option and porn site operators are not forced to get .xxx domain names and go through the vetting process. Nick Fox, a spokesman for Sir Richard, told The Telegraph: 'Virgin Group treats the use of its and Sir Richard’s name on the web very seriously and we ensure that there are no unauthorised sites operating that will confuse customers. 'ICANN has ordered the transfer of the richardbranson.xxx domain name to Virgin. We are pleased with the outcome of this dispute.'","Ruling decided it had been registered 'in bad faith'

A hopelessly lost pensioner who set off on a three-hour journey at breakfast time was caught driving the wrong way down a motorway at 4am - after 19 hours at the wheel. Maureen Darvell, 83, travelled seven miles down the fast lane on the wrong side of the M3 as cars swerved to avoid her before she was arrested. The pensioner got confused on a 175-mile journey from her home in Ashford, Kent, to a relative's wedding in Bristol and spent almost a day on the roads trying to find her destination. Banned: Maureen Darvell, 83, spent 19 hours trying to get to the wedding in Bristol before she was arrested driving the wrong way down a motorway. She is now selling the car . After heading towards London, she took a wrong turn on the M25 and ended up driving towards Bournemouth. She realised she had made a mistake 110-miles into her trip and changed direction. But rather than heading north-west towards her destination she went north-east - back from where she had come. Confused, she eventually pulled over on the A303 at Micheldever in Hampshire, around 60 miles north-east of Bournemouth, for a coffee in the early hours of the morning. When she left the service station - after nearly 19 hours on the roads - she accidentally drove back down the carriageway she had arrived on - into the oncoming traffic. She went up a slip road onto the M3 and drove a total of seven miles down the fast lane hoping to find a gap in the central reservation so she could turn round. Lost: Maureen left her home in Ashford, Kent, on September 8 and was eventually arrested near Basingstoke on the M3 driving the wrong way down the fast lane. She was heading for Bristol . Folkestone Magistrates' Court was told the pensioner set off in her 15-year-old Nissan Micra on the morning of September 9 - and was not found until after 3.30am on September 10. Victoria Urmossy, defending, told the . court: 'Mrs Darvell left her home in Kent at 9am and took the wrong . turning off of the M25 and became lost. 'When she got to Bournemouth she knew she had taken a wrong turn and tried to find her way back. 'She stopped at the service station and she is still not sure what time she left - but she was extremely tired. Lost: Maureen, 83, should have got to Bristol from her home in just three hours but got very confused - and ended up near Bournemouth . 'On the dual carriageway she realised . that she was going the wrong way so she moved to the lane alongside the . central reservation trying to find a gap. 'She could see traffic on the other . carriageway going the way she wanted to go so she stayed in the outside . lane looking for a break in the central reservation crash barrier so she . could cross over.' Neil Sweeney, prosecuting, said police . received 'lots of phone calls from drivers' about the slow moving Micra . in the overtaking lane. He told the court: 'Mrs Darvell . continued along the A303 and then continued along the slip road onto the . M3 travelling north on the southbound carriageway. 'She was stopped by police at junction 6 for Basingstoke at 3.50am around seven miles from where she had set out. 'When she was stopped, she confirmed she knew she had been travelling the wrong way. 'She was asked why she had not turned around and she replied ""Because I did not want to go that way"". 'It was then she explained to police . she was travelling to Bristol. It was just before four in the morning, . she had set out from Ashford the previous day.' The court heard how Darvell, who . pleaded guilty to dangerous driving, had been driving for 50 years and . had only ever received one speeding ticket. Magistrate Elaine Sawyer banned the pensioner . from driving for 15 months, telling her: 'You will be fined £100 with . £85 costs and a £15 victim surcharge, which you must pay at £10 a . fortnight.' She was also ordered to retake her . driving test if she ever wanted to be allowed out on the roads again. However, she told the court she was planning on selling her car and . 'upgrading to a mobility scooter'.","Maureen Darvell, 83, drove seven miles on the wrong side of the M3 .

"By . Louise Boyle . Last updated at 12:35 PM on 22nd February 2012 . Even the President of the United States can't say no to the king of the blues. Barack Obama found himself belting out a few bars of Sweet Home Chicago, the blues anthem of his  hometown, after being cajoled by the legendary B.B. King - part of an ensemble of musical stars who came together at the White House last night to celebrate Black History Month. The intimate gig in the  East Room had almost wound down, when guitarist Buddy Guy reminded the president that he had burst into a cover of Al Green's Let's Stay Together at a recent rally. The musician quipped to Obama: 'You gotta keep it up.' Scroll down for video . Oh, go on then: Obama didn't miss the opportunity to sing a few bars of blues classic Sweet Home Chicago with legends B.B King and Mick Jagger at the White House last night . Listen up: B.B. King was part of the ensemble cast at the White House during a blues performance to celebrate Black History Month . Ever the charmer: President Obama sings few notes with legend BB King . With wife Michelle clapping her approval and cheers from the crowd, Obama shook his head in refusal - but then readily accepted a microphone offered by Mick Jagger before he launched into song. 'Come on, baby don't you want to go,' the . president sang twice, handing the microphone to B.B. King momentarily - then taking it back to tack on 'Sweet Home Chicago' before making a suave exit. The President's impromptu burst into song came as leading Republican presidential hopeful Rick Santorum dubbed Obama a 'rock star' who was acting like royalty running the country. Earlier this week, Santorum told the Maricopa County Lincoln Day lunch in Phoenix, Arizona: 'Back in 2008, the American public at a time of crisis went for a rock star that they believed could solve their problems, someone that they believed in to make a difference in their lives. A presidential tune: Obama sings with BB King to the delight of the audience . Smooth: First Lady Michelle looks delighted as the President improvised on a couple of bars with the ensemble blues cast . Blues brothers: (l-r) Mick Jagger, B.B. King and Buddy Guy came together on stage to celebrate Black History Month . Intimate gig: The performance took place in the East Room of the White House and will be broadcast on PBS next week . 'This election, Americans are going to go back to what we've done in the past. We're looking for leaders, not who we believe in, we're looking for a leader who believes in you.' At the star-studded White House event, Obama opened the celebration by telling the crowd there were 'downsides' to running the country -  before adding that 'things even out a little bit' when music legends like King and Jagger, along with Jeff Beck, Buddy Guy and Grammy-winner Keb Mo, stopped by to jam. The President continued: 'This music speaks to something universal. No one goes through life without both joy and pain, triumph and sorrow. The blues gets all of that, sometimes with just one lyric or one note.' B.B. King, 86, arrived in a wheelchair but stood to kick off the night with a raucous version of Let The Good Times Roll. He followed with The Thrill Is Gone. Rock and roll: Jeff Beck (left) and Keb Mo (right) were on stage at the White House to entertain the Obamas and their guests . Obama, who was joined at the concert by wife Michelle and her mother Marian Robinson, swayed in his seat and sang along to a playlist including St James Infirmary and Let Me Love You. Beck slowed things down with an instrumental Brush With the Blues, as anticipation built for the arrival of Mick Jagger, who did not disappoint. The Rolling Stones frontman sang I Can't Turn You Loose and then teamed up with Beck on Commit a Crime. Jagger got the Obamas out of their seats, swaying and clapping to the music, and picked up the pace with Miss You performed with Shemekia Copeland and Susan Tedeschi. Sharing a tune: B.B. King (left) and the President improvised on the last song of the night Sweet Home Chicago . Obama at times closed his eyes and nodded his head along to the music. Before the closing number of Sweet Home Chicago, Obama said: 'For Michelle and me, there's no blues like the song our artists have chosen to close with - the blues from our hometown.' The lineup for Tuesday's concert spanned multiple generations, from legends like King and Guy to young faces such as 26-year-old Troy 'Trombone Shorty' Andrews and Gary Clark Jr, whose style blends hip hop, contemporary soul and indie rock. American classics: Shemekia Copeland (left) and Susan Tedeschi (right) sing during a celebration of blues music where they were joined by the President himself for the finale . Also performing were Warren Haynes and Derek Trucks, with actress Taraji P. Henson as the program host and Booker T Jones as music director and band leader.

"By . Peter Allen . Last updated at 7:15 PM on 22nd February 2012 . A prostitute has claimed that former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn tried to get her a visa to work in the USA, it has emerged. The revelation came as the 62-year-old was released from custody in Lille, northern France, after two days of questioning about an illegal vice ring based in the city. Strauss-Kahn is facing charges of 'complicity in pimping' and 'misuse of corporate assets' - crimes which could see him locked up for a total of 12 years. Judges have already charged a number of men with organising orgies, and a building company executive is accused of using its money to entertain guests at sex parties held in cities around the world, including Paris and Washington DC. Questions: Journalists watch as Dominique Strauss-Kahn arrived by car at a Lille police station after being brought from his prison cell . Arrested: Former IMF director Dominique Strauss-Kahn before he was arrested . Strauss-Kahn admits attending many of the parties - but claims he did not know the girls were prostitutes because they were 'all naked at the time'. Now it has emerged that one of the women involved claims she flew to Washington DC when Strauss-Kahn was IMF chief. 'There Strauss-Kahn is said to have tried to get her a visa for her to remain in the USA,' said a legal source close to the case. 'This would have huge ramifications on Strauss-Kahn's defence as it would prove he was assisting a prostitute in her work - something which is illegal in France. 'The allegation that an IMF chief was trying to get visas for prostitutes would also create a huge scandal.' The woman, who has not been named, is said to have documentary evidence, including pictures of her with Strauss-Kahn. Phone records suggest Strauss-Kahn was in contact with at least 10 call girls. All of the women, who are mainly French and Belgians from immigrant backgrounds, claim to have had paid sex with him while he was IMF chief. But Strauss-Kahn's lawyer, Henri Leclerc, said his client was 'totally unaware' that the women were receiving cash. Legal help: Frederique Beaulieu, one of Strauss-Kahn's three lawyers, enters a Lille police station . Couple: Dominique Strauss-Kahn is pictured here previously with his wife Anne Sinclair. She has caused astonishment by staying with her husband, despite him admitting to numerous affairs . 'At these parties, people were not necessarily dressed, and I defy you to tell the difference between a naked prostitute and any other naked woman,' said Mr Leclerc. Strauss-Kahn's night in a 10ft by 12ft police cell in Lille was his seventh in custody in the past year - but all the rest were spent in the USA where he faced an allegation of attempted rape. While in America Strauss-Kahn complained about having to wear handcuffs, and his humiliation in France also looked likely to lead to protests from his lawyers. Alleged victim: New York chambermaid Nafissatou Diallo . His stark cell contained a four inch high foam mattress, a hole-in-the-floor toilet, and an observance window which allowed a police officer to watch him constantly. Strauss-Kahn admits taking part in orgies and said he had an 'uninhibited sex life', but that he 'never paid a centime' for it. 'I have a horror of prostitutes and pimping,' he said. Judicial officials say he will be summoned again next month by three judges who will decide if there is enough evidence to file charges in a case focusing on the alleged prostitution ring in France and Belgium. Strauss-Kahn, a leading member of the French Socialist Party who wanted to run for President this year, resigned from the IMF last May after being accused of raping Nafissatou Diallo, a 32-year-old chambermaid in a New York hotel. The US case collapsed, but when he returned to France Tristane Banon, a 32-year-old writer, accused him of attempting to rape her. Prosecutors found prima facie evidence of sexual assault, but said the alleged attack - which happened in 2003 - was too old to pursue. Now Strauss-Kahn is at the centre of an entirely separate investigation into the prostitution ring which operated out of Lille's upmarket Carlton Hotel. Allegations include that he paid a . 30-year-old escort between €500 to €1,000 to sleep with him 11 times, as . he 'had sex with escort girls at libertine parties financed by French . businessmen'. Another . prostitute was allegedly given a guided tour of the International . Monetary Fund headquarters in Washington after an evening in his . company. Hookers are also said to have been flown out to Washington to . entertain him. Strauss-Kahn, who is still facing a civil suit from the New York chamber maid, is said to have attended a number of the parties. The last one he attended was in Washington in May, just before he was accused of attempted rape by Ms Diallo. Prostitution is legal in France for women over 18, but acting as a pimp - or somebody who controls prostitutes and makes money out of them - is. There is also a suggestion that some of the girls involved in the Carlton ring may have been underage. Strauss-Kahn has been keeping a low profile since returning from the U.S.A., living quietly in Paris with his wife, Anne Sinclair. Ms Sinclair, a former TV presenter who now runs a news website in the French capital, has caused astonishment by staying with her husband, despite him admitting to numerous affairs.

A U.S. reality TV producer potentially facing up to 30 years in prison today spoke out from a Mexican jail cell to insist he didn’t kill his wife, who was found dead in a sewer cistern during a family holiday. Bruce Beresford-Redman, 40, of Los Angeles, California, has been ordered to stand trial over the killing of his wife Monica Beresford-Redman, 42, at a luxury Cancun resort in April 2010. The Contender and Survivor producer allegedly strangled her and left her body in a sewer - but he told CBS News that his wife went out shopping one morning on the holiday and never returned.

Prison cell: Mr Beresford-Redman said it is 'ludicrous and completely false' for prosecutors to suggest he killed his wife and left her in a hotel room for the whole day while he went in and out with his children . ‘I didn't kill my wife, I really didn't,’ he told 48 Hours Mystery on CBS. ‘I can't imagine how anyone who listened to everything said could possibly think I had anything to do with killing my wife.’ Mrs Beresford-Redman’s body was found when the couple were on holiday with their young children in an attempt to save their marriage, after she learned her husband was cheating on her. ‘It was her birthday,’ the Emmy-nominated producer told CBS for the show on Saturday at 10pm ET. ‘It was a family trip. And we just said: “Look, let's just go and have a good time” - and that was it.’ Part of the evidence in the case includes statements from hotel guests who said they heard loud arguing and cries of distress coming from the couple's room on the night she went missing.

A Mexican judge ordered the trial last Wednesday after deciding there was enough evidence to go ahead with it - but Jaime Cancino, defending, said his client was ‘distraught’ by the ruling and passed out when it was made. ‘It's something very strange because there is no evidence in the case,’ Mr Cancino said, adding that he would appeal the order, announced by Quintana Roo state prosecutor Ludwin Vivas Arjona.

"By . Chris Parsons . Last updated at 1:06 AM on 25th February 2012 . A pair of Polish drug criminals who tried to smuggle 17 kilos of cocaine into Britain inside live tropical fish were jailed yesterday. Olaf Urlik, 33, and Norbert Jarzabek, 32, both originally from Poland, first practised and then attempted to smuggle the high purity cocaine, worth an estimated £1.6m at wholesale, from Colombia into the UK. The drug was dissolved in bags of fluid and then stored inside larger bags with the live fish, the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) said. Reeled in: Olaf Urlik (left) and Norbert Jarzabek (right) attempted to smuggle the cocaine worth £1.6m from Colombia into the UK . More than 16,000 fish died after the pair's scheme, while police who followed the pair to a house in Nottingham later raided the property and found fish dead or dying in colanders inside. Jarzabek carried out a trial run last April in a lock up garage in Islington, London, after collecting a consignment of fish at Heathrow airport. Urlik and Jarzabek then plotted the shipment which would contain cocaine, unaware that investigators from SOCA were watching. The shipment of 25 double boxes of tropical fish arrived on July 9, labelled 'Live Tropical Fish, Handle With Extreme Care.' When Soca and UK Border Agency officials scanned the boxes, they found ten containing bags of dissolved cocaine. The two Polish drug smugglers dissolved the cocaine into water in bags inside these boxes . Jarzabek picked up the fish at the airport two days later. The consignment was loaded into the back of a van and driven to a property in Glade Avenue, Nottingham. Urlik joined Jarzabek at the flat around 2am after flying in from Amsterdam. Bagged: An image shows the bags used to transport the dissolved cocaine, which had a value of around £1.6m . An hour and a half later, officers from SOCA and UKBA swooped and arrested the men at the scene, where a number of fish were found dead or dying in a colander due to a lack of oxygen. Urlik and Jarzabek were jailed for 11 years each at Nottingham Crown Court today after admitting conspiracy to import cocaine at an earlier hearing. Although thousands of fish died in the drug smuggling,  34 survivors, including stingrays, catfish and tetras, are currently recovering in ZSL London Zoo. Sentencing the pair today, His Honour Judge Head, said: 'This was a highly sophisticated operation. 'Both these men had a substantial awareness of what they were doing, each had a leading role and both set to gain substantially.' . Following the hearing, Gerry Smyth, from SOCA, said: 'These two were exceptionally callous. They used living creatures as a test run and then effectively as packaging for their drugs, seeing only the profits they would make. 'SOCA is grateful to the expert teams at ZSL London Zoo who helped us out in this very unusual case. 'Partnerships . at a national and international level are vital if we are to tackle . drug trafficking. Drugs cause misery for families and communities. These . criminals are now facing lengthy jail terms and they've been denied . their profits.' Rachel Jones, from London Zoo, who are looking after the surviving fish, said: 'Despite the awful way that they came about being here, we are pleased to say that the fish are now thriving at ZSL London Zoo's Aquarium. The 34 surviving fish from the scheme, including stingrays, catfish and tetras, are currently recovering at ZSL London Zoo . 'When we first got the fish, most of them were drastically underweight, and they'd been living in cold, dirty water for days. 'Since we've been caring for them, we've seen vast improvements in their health; they're growing really fast and they've joined groups of other Amazonian species for the public to see. They have a great future ahead of them, here at the Zoo'. Jacqueline Finn, senior lawyer in the CPS organised crime division, said: 'This case demonstrates the extraordinary and innovative lengths that drug dealers will go to so they can ply their evil trade. Scheme: During sentencing at Nottingham Crown Court, His Honour Judge Head told the Polish pair they were part of a 'sophisticated operation' 'Urlik and Jarzabek thought that by having diluted cocaine hidden in bags of fish they would escape detection and net huge profits but they did not realise their plot had been detected. 'The joint investigation by SOCA, UKBA and Nottinghamshire Police provided the Crown Prosecution Service with detailed evidence against the two men. 'We worked closely with the agencies to build a strong case and when confronted with the evidence against them, Urlik and Jarzabek both pleaded guilty.'","Olaf Urlik and Norbert Jarzabek tried to smuggle drug from Colombia to UK .

A mother was today found guilty of child neglect after her two-year-old son died after drinking poisonous plant food she was using to grow cannabis. Lauren Booth, 24, was cultivating the drug for 'extra cash' in her home in Huddersfield, using plant food commonly used in hydroponic growing. Bradford Crown Court heard she was asleep when her son Aaron drank the toxic liquid just after midday on November 6, 2010. Booth denied wilfully ill-treating or neglecting her son but was found guilty by a jury after two hours of deliberations. Lauren Booth (right), pictured at Bradford Crown Court, was found guilty of child neglect following the death of her two-year-old son Aaron (left) She was granted bail while reports are carried out into her background and she will be sentenced on April 16. The jury was told Aaron had not been fed and was probably extremely hungry and thirsty when he drank the plant food. Thomas Storey, prosecuting, said . information on a notebook and laptop seized from the house by police, as . well as Booth’s comments to Aaron’s father while their son was in . hospital, showed that the plant food was being used for growing . cannabis. Aaron died 11 days later at Leeds . General Infirmary after his windpipe disintegrated. He had suffered . several other injuries, including burns to his stomach, pancreas and . spleen. The court heard that Booth and her . partner were awoken by a loud thud at around 12.40pm on November 6, to . find Aaron lying down with a brown mouth and lips. Tragic toddler Aaron Booth died after drinking . toxic plant food meant to help his mother Lauren's cannabis grow, . thinking it was a Fruit Shoot drink (right). Pictured left is a stock . image of a cannabis plant . Booth’s partner, who spent a lot of time at the house, ran across the road to borrow a telephone to call the emergency services. By the time paramedics arrived, Aaron’s mouth and lips were purple and he was foaming at the mouth. He was taken to hospital in Huddersfield before being transferred to Leeds General Infirmary (LGI). The court heard that Aaron’s father, . Mohammed Khan, who was no longer in a relationship with the boy’s . mother, did not know his son was in hospital until November 14, after a . friend told him. That day he went to the LGI where . Booth seemed more concerned about having to move her cannabis plants . than her son’s condition, according to the prosecutor. Mr Storey said: 'She told him that . she and her partner had been trying to make some money by growing skunk . in the house, almost seeming annoyed by the involvement of the police . because they were going to have to find somewhere else to grow the . skunk, seemingly not bothered about her son.' The home of Lauren Booth, in Huddersfield, where toddler Aaron drank from a bottle of plant food . The prosecutor told the court that the laptop seized from the house by police had been in use since August 2010. Mr Storey said a forensic examination . found that videos giving tips on how to grow cannabis had been accessed . on it, and a Google search had been entered that said: 'How to use pH . test for ganja.' He said: 'The user of that laptop had . been researching the growing of cannabis in a domestic situation. It . was something the defendant was aware of, if not an active participant . in.' A photo of a notebook obtained from . the house was shown to the jury, with a page containing numerous . references to cannabis and home-growing. The blue plant food bottle could have been mistaken by Aaron as the soft drink Fruit Shoot, according to Mr Storey. But it contained a highly toxic concentration of chemicals that would have been a fatal dose. Mr Storey said: 'The cultivation of cannabis also explains the presence in the house of that liquid.' The prosecutor said that Booth’s . partner could have had time to remove any trace of cannabis from the . house in the time between going to hospital with Aaron and police . searching the home later that evening, as he did not stay in hospital . for long. Mr Storey said police found a . cluttered house but Aaron’s room was empty, with black curtains and an . open window on a cold November night.","Lauren Booth, 24, and her boyfriend were growing the drug for 'extra cash'

"By . Kirsty Walker . Last updated at 4:21 PM on 24th February 2012 . A Tory MP who was caught up in the Commons brawl that saw Labour MP Eric Joyce arrested has  said the shamed politician was 'not in a good place'. Tory backbencher Andrew Percy, one of . those believed to have been caught up in the fracas yesterday, tweeted this . morning that he felt 'sorry' for Joyce. Insisting . he was 'fine' after the incident, the Brigg and Goole MP added: 'Tbh, I . sort of feel sorry for him. People in a good place don't act like that. That's all I'll tweet on it!' Mr Joyce was was last night charged with three counts of common assault after allegedly attacking seven people – including four MPs – in a House of Commons bar. Eight police officers were said to have been called to the incident involving ex-Army major Eric Joyce. Tory MP Stuart Andrew was left bleeding from the nose and suffering concussion after apparently being head-butted twice. Labour whip Phil Wilson also suffered a cut to his face. Torp MP Stuart Andrew, left, is understood to have been injured in the alleged bar brawl with Labour MP Ed Joyce, pictured right leaving a police station yesterday after being questioned . Drinks in the House of Commons bar at the centre of the alleged bar brawl are heavily discounted thanks to a taxpayer subsidy. Members can buy a pint of bitter for £2.40 or £2.95 for lager - considerably cheaper than prices in nearby Westminster pubs, which are closer to £4 a pint. On spirits, MPs can enjoy a glass of whisky or Cointreau for just £2.55. And wine isn’t much more expensive - with wine by the glass from just £2.30, according to the Commons drinks menu. MPs can chose from Sauvignon Blanc at £2.35 for a 125ml glass - compared with £3.00 at the nearest pub to the Commons the Red Lion in Whitehall or a small glass of Shiraz at £2.95, compared to £3.75. Other offerings include a glass of vintage port at £2.65, a pint of Bulmer’s cider at £2.90 (£3.50 in the Red Lion) and a bottle of Commons Champagne Brut for £30.15 (£38.15 in the Red Lion). The bar is generally open until 10pm but has been known to stay open until 3am or 4am.The Commons has nine bars, which took £1.33 million in the year to 2011 - £206,100 of which was from the Strangers’ bar. Taxpayers forked out £5.8 million for the Commons catering service, which runs the bars last year despite pledges to bring down the cost. The . drama unfolded in the Strangers’ Bar, where MPs had been entertaining . guests including the Canadian Speaker and a group of children, on . Wednesday evening. Mr Joyce, . 51, who was suspended from the Labour Party yesterday, was taken to . Belgravia police station where he stayed overnight and was questioned . until late last night. After . he was charged, he was released on bail and driven away from the rear . of the police station at around 11.20pm. He was sitting in the back of a . dark hatchback car, wearing a white shirt and dark suit and appeared . pale and unshaven. The MP will appear before West London magistrates on March 7. Police were called just after 10.30pm following complaints from MPs in the Strangers’ Bar that one of Mr Joyce’s male guests was singing in a loud operatic voice. Present in the bar were MPs from all parties including Tories Mr Andrew, Andrew Percy and Alec Shelbrooke and Labour members Mr Wilson and Graham Jones. Tory MP Jackie Doyle-Price was also there with a couple of her researchers and a Conservative councillor, Luke Mackenzie. During the fracas, Mr Shelbrooke claims to have been hit in the head and Mr Wilson’s face was cut and blood was seen pouring all over his shirt. Mr Mackenzie, a councillor in Basildon, said: ‘Two people were standing up and one guy was going for the other. I stepped in between them and I tried to break it up. Punches were flying everywhere. I have a swollen lip, but I am OK.’ One witness claimed: ‘It was horrific and shocking. There were tables overturned and drinks smashed everywhere. There was blood everywhere. ‘You would expect this on a lads holiday in Faliraki, but not in the Mother of Parliaments.’ Mr Andrew, who is understood to be pressing charges, yesterday tweeted: ‘I’m OK.’ Scotland Yard said: ‘We were called at approximately 10.50pm last night [Wednesday] to reports of a disturbance at a bar within the House of Commons. ‘A man aged in his 50s was arrested by officers on suspicion of assault. He remains in custody in a central London police station. Inquiries are continuing.’ The Labour Party said: ‘This is an extremely serious incident. We have suspended Eric Joyce pending the results of the police investigation.’ Mr Joyce, pictured in 2010 after returning home from a police cell when he failed a provide a breath test, has been suspended by the Labour Party following last night's brawl in a Commons bar . Eric Joyce is congratulated by his wife Rosemary after winning the Falkirk West by-election in December 2000 . Speculation about the incident has been rife in Westminster but Commons Speaker John Bercow thwarted any attempt to raise the matter in the chamber by issuing a stern warning at the start of proceedings. He told MPs: ‘Members will be aware of reports of a serious incident in the House last night. I have been informed by the Serjeant at Arms that the honourable member for Falkirk has been detained in police custody. ‘The matter is being investigated. I take this matter very seriously, as do the House authorities. I would ask that no further reference should be made to these reports in the Chamber today.’ If Mr Joyce is convicted of a criminal offence, it would trigger a by-election in his constituency. The MP, who was elected in December 2000, has served as a senior aide to several Labour ministers including former Defence Secretary Bob Ainsworth. But he is understood to have had marriage problems and colleagues have been concerned that he had been drinking heavily in recent months. Before the incident, Mr Joyce was seen with two women. In 2010, he resigned as Labour’s Northern Ireland spokesman after failing to provide a breath test. He quit as the parliamentary private secretary to Mr Ainsworth in 2009 due to concerns over the war in Afghanistan. The Strangers’ Bar has long been regarded as the rowdiest of the drinking establishments in the Palace of Westminster. Late-night voting means that many MPs head to Strangers to gossip and plot until they can go home. The bar stays open as long as the House of Commons sits – usually until 10pm, but sometimes well into the early hours, as late as 3am or 4am. On some occasions it has even stayed open 24 hours as debates carried on through the night. The bar has gained a reputation as a rowdy environment because MPs from rival political parties often clash after a few drinks. MPs in the 'rowdy' Stranger's Bar in the Commons. None of those pictures were involved in Wednesday's incident . Some MPs have raised concerns about the heavy drinking culture in the Commons, where drinks are subsidised by taxpayers. For example, in the Strangers’ Bar MPs can enjoy a pint of bitter for £2.40 or a lager for £2.95 – typically a third less than prices in nearby pubs in Westminster. Records show that a total of £1.33million was spent in the House of Commons’s nine bars in the year to March 2011. The Strangers’ bar had takings of £206,100. The taxpayer subsidy for the Commons catering service, which runs the bars, rose to £5.8million last year, despite promises to slash the cost of refreshing MPs. It meant that for every £10 an MP spent on food and drink, the taxpayer added a top-up of £7.60. The subsidy means MPs can enjoy a glass of whisky or a Cointreau liqueur after work for £2.55, or a glass of Merlot over lunch for £2.35. Last year Dr Sarah Wollaston, a GP and MP for Totnes, said some MPs are too drunk to stand up in debates and have ‘no idea’ what they are  voting for. She said: ‘Who would go to see a surgeon who had just drunk a bottle of wine at lunchtime? But we fully accept that MPs are perfectly capable of performing as MPs despite some of them drinking really quite heavily.’ Tory MP Mark Reckless apologised for being too drunk to vote on George Osborne’s first Budget in 2010. He said: ‘I normally have just one or two and know when to stop. I don’t know what happened. I don’t remember falling over. ‘I remember someone asking me to vote and not thinking it was appropriate, given how I was at the time.’ Also in 2010 Labour MP Paul Farrelly admitted he wrestled a Commons newspaper seller in a corridor near Parliament’s Sports and Social Club bar. But he insisted his ‘John Prescott moment’ was an act of self-defence and he had not been drunk. Public health minister Anne Milton recently said: ‘I think that Members of Parliament or people who work in jobs similar to the one that we do – fairly anti-social hours, often working at a distance from family – are susceptible to certain sorts of risky behaviour, and drinking and poor mental health are without doubt among them.’","Andrew Percy says he 'feels sorry' for Joyce who 'can't be in a good place'

"By . Peter Allen . Last updated at 2:43 PM on 23rd August 2011 . The American woman who accuses Dominique Strauss-Kahn of trying to rape her in New York is now set to testify against him in Paris, it sensationally emerged today. While Nafissatou Diallo's case against the former International Monetary Fund chief looks set to collapse in the U.S., she could yet see him brought to justice in his home city of Paris. A lawyer for the 32-year-old confirmed that he had filed a complaint today accusing Strauss-Kahn's staff of interfering with a potential prosecution witness. Legal battle: Hotel maid Nafissatou Diallo, left, may testify against Dominique Strauss-Kahn, left, in Paris over accusations of witness tampering . The witness is a past lover of Strauss-Kahn who claims he abused her while he was the mayor of the Paris suburb of Sarcelles. Strauss-Kahn was already married to Anne Sinclair, his third wife, when he allegedly met the witness at a party organised by the French Socialist Party in 1997. They became lovers within hours, it is claimed, even though she was just 23 and he was 47, and went on to meet regularly for almost a year. But when their secret affair ended badly she is said to have tried to commit suicide because of Strauss-Kahn's abuse. Mystery woman: The former IMF chief is facing allegations his staff interfered with a potential witness based in Paris . Paris-based barrister Thibault de Montbrial said he had today filed the complaint in Pontoise, another Paris suburb, saying Strauss-Kahn's legal team had 'put pressure' on the witness, including offering her money to remain silent. This would amount to perjury, and could result in a prison sentence for those involved in the alleged cover-up of evidence, with Ms Diallo appearing in Paris as a prosecution witness. It would also allow Ms Diallo's legal team to rehearse their case against Strauss-Kahn in France, so opening him up to further prosecution. Mr De Montbrial said Strauss-Kahn's associates had clearly made an 'attempt at witness tampering' so as to scupper the New York case. Strauss-Kahn is expected back in Paris this week because the New York prosecutor does not want to pursue the case against him. There has even been talk of Strauss-Kahn, a Socialist politician, resuming his campaign to succeed Nicolas Sarkozy as President of France next year. On his way home? Former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn and wife Anne Sinclair were pictured taking a stroll around Tribeca over the weekend . Socialist Party chief Martine Aubry called it 'an immense relief' that prosecutors asked a judge to put an end to the case based on concerns about the accuser's credibility. Ms Aubry said on France-Info radio today: 'We were all waiting for this ... for him to finally be able to get out of this nightmare.' 'Useful to his country': Socialist Party frontrunner Francois Hollande has backed Strauss-Kahn's political return . The man who replaced Strauss-Khan as favourite for the Socialist Party presidential nomination yesterday said the former IMF chief's political comeback could be 'envisaged'. Francois Hollande told France Inter Radio: 'A man with the abilities of Dominique Strauss-Kahn can be useful to his country in the months and years to come.' Although Strauss-Kahn has missed the July deadline for potential Socialist candidates to declare, several party heavyweights have previously suggested it pushed back. But even if Strauss-Kahn is set free in the U.S., he is also facing an allegation that he tried to rape French writer Tristane Banon, 32, in a Paris flat in 2003. He mother, 65-year-old Anne Mansouret, has also told how Strauss-Kahn had 'brutal but consensual' sex with her in his Paris office. Strauss-Kahn, who is currently living in New York with no bail conditions, denies all the charges aimed at him in both the U.S. and France.","Claims DSK's staff 'put pressure' on potential witness .

A former member of the Bergholz Clan - the group thought to be behind the beard cutting - has spoken out against them, claiming that leader Sam Mullet rules the cult with an iron fist and said he wouldn't be surprised if it ended in mass suicide or some other tragedy. The man, who did not want to be named, told WKYC that Mullet moved to Bergholz about 15 years ago with around 120 member who all have to live by his rules. He compared the sect to the former Peoples Temple, whose leader was Jim Jones. In 1978, the cult ended in a mass suicide in Jonestown, Guyana. He told the TV channel: 'I'm not surprised if I have to call the sheriff some day and say there are a lot of dead people lying around here. That would not be a surprise to me nor would it be a surprise to the sheriff of that county. 'I have enough inside information that I have no question if something is not done, there will be people that get hurt.' The former member says there were forced beatings, pitting one member against another and there are heavy punishments when members disagree with bishop Mullet. Arrested: Lester Mullet (left) and Johnny Mullet (right) were arrested in Ohio for the alleged role in crimes by 'The Bergholz Clan' He said: 'He would take the wife from the man. The wife would have to go and live with Sam. The husband of that wife would have to go to the chicken coop or out in the barn in the middle of the winter, sometimes day and night.' One of the woman, whose husband Myron Miller had his beard cut off by the gang earlier this month,said she heard many stories about the 'brainwashing, the beatings, the locking up, and the women he is using'. Arlene Miller said she and her husband helped one of Mullet's sons - Bill - escape from the clan and believes that may have been one of the reasons why he was attacked. Bob Comer, friends of the Millers who witnessed the attack, told NPR that he once drove Mullet and about 15 other men and women to Mullet's chiropractor. He said he overheard a conversation between one young woman and the 66-year-old leader. 'She said in Pennsylvania Dutch, which is a German dialect, ""Sam, who's going to see you tonight?"" And then the other women laughed and giggled. And I thought, ""Whoa, wait a minute, is he having sex with all these women?""' Comer said he has also heard reports of child abuse and daily beatings among the terrified community. Until recently, the sheriff could do little, because the Amish victims chose to shrug off the assaults rather than bring in law enforcement. But with a spate of attacks since September, people began to cooperate. Two of the Amish bishop's 18 children have been infiltrated in the beard cuttings. Johnny S. Mullet and Lester S. Mullet will go to trial along with Levi and Eli Miller and and Daniel S. Mullet. He is Mullet's nephew. Also charged: Levi Miller was also arrested in connection to the crime . The men hired a lawyer and the case has been sent to felony court after they waived a preliminary hearing on the evidence on Wesneday. They were freed on $50,000 bond last week which Sam Mullet is said to have paid. Their lawyer Andrew Hyde defended the men and said it was them paying their own legal bills and not Mullet, telling WKYC: 'The five men I've met in this case are complete gentlemen with deeply founded Christian beliefs. 'I think a lot of the fear-mongering is being done by others to try to . show these gentlemen in a bad light. 'The experience I've had with them would cause me no fear at all. I'd have them in my house tomorrow.' Devon Miller, a Mennonite man from nearby Holmesville, attended the hearing, and said he was concerned about the bad reputation the Amish community has been getting because of the alleged actions of Sam Mullet's followers. Mr Miller said: 'This is not part of what the Amish believe.It's a good example of how too much power corrupts. Church followers should not be dominated by one person or one bishop, otherwise you have this.' Sam Mullet denies his clan is a cult but sees value in punishing those who don't follow church teaching. 'You don't obey the law, you're punished, and it's the same way with the church,' Mullet said. The men are said to have acted at the direction of the 66-year-old over an unspecified dispute about church discipline and practices. In the Amish community, beards on men and long hair on women have spiritual value, and forcibly cutting either is a symbolic assault meant to denigrate. In court: The five Amish men accused of aggravated burglary and kidnapping who will go on trial . Exposed: The men wore matching denim outfits and hats in court on Wednesday. They have hired a lawyer to fight their case . On October 4, the men are accused of bursting into an Ohio home and holding an Amish men down as they attempted to cut his beard and hair off with scissors and a battery-powered shaver. There were more attacks, with victims including children as young as 13, who were targeted by as many as 27 members of the gang. Sam Mullet is the father of two of the men arrested for allegedly going into the home of other Amish and cutting their hair and beards, and the uncle of another . The attacks occurred over the past month in the heart of Ohio's Amish population, one of the largest in the United States. Authorities are investigating similar attacks in Jefferson, Carroll and Trumbull counties, all of which Sheriff Fred Abdulla of Jefferson County believes were orchestrated by Sam Mullet. Sheriff Abdulla said he once had a good relationship with Mullet, but the pair have had many run-ins over the years, including when he prosecuted one of his sons, Crist, for raping a 12-year-old girl. The sheriff also claims that Mullet threatened to kill him and some of his own children nad was once involved in a custody battle. He was once committed for a psychiatric examination. But Sam Mullett has denied he ordered the attack, but admitted the goal was to send a message to Amish in Holmes County, Ohio, that they should be ashamed of themselves for the way they were treating Mullet and his community. Sam Mullet said: 'We'd like to get up in the morning, be left alone, live like normal people. They won't leave us be. 'But I didn't order anything like that. I didn't tell them not to, I'm still not going to tell them not to.' Amish men typically grow beards as adults and stop trimming them when they marry, and the beards are held in high esteem. He said the men hired a driver to carry them to Holmes County and to Carroll County, where a similar attack was carried out. He said the driver didn't know what the men were doing. Arlene Miller told how her husband Myron was dragged out of their bed by his beard, taken outside and assaulted. Attorney: Andrew Hyde defended the men and said they were 'complete gentlemen with deeply founded Christian beliefs' She . said: ‘The guys came up and surrounded him and cut off a chunk of his . beard. They were unable to get any more because he struggled so hard . against them. 'The [attackers] say this is to uncover sins, and it’s to straighten us out.’ A . 57-year-old woman said her sons and a son-in-law who had joined the . rival group and are involved in a cult attacked her and her husband. After chopping off her husband’s whiskers, they shaved her head. 'They did this to me,’ she said, taking off a bandana to show her baldness.","Sam Mullet accused of beating and brainwashing members of his community .

All of the best sportsmen can expect to have the odd bad day at the office even at the height of their fame, and this was Jeremy Lin’s first as his rise from unknown to stardom hit its first major snag. The league-leading Miami Heat and LeBron James beat point guard Lin and the New York Knicks by 102-88 last night as they raced to their eighth straight win, with all coming by at least 12 points. Lin was outmuscled and outfought by James as the Heat star put up 20 points, nine rebounds, eight assists, five steals and two blocks, while Chris Bosh scored 25 points and Dwyane Wade added 22. Disappointing: New York Knicks point guard Jeremy Lin had a game to forget as his side went down 102-88 to the Miami Heat in Florida on Thursday night at the American Airlines Arena . Lin's final line meanwhile was 1 for 11 from the field, eight points, three assists and eight turnovers - far from the 23.9 points and 9.2 assists he averaged over his first 11 games in the Knicks' rotation. ‘I'm sure they were all geeked up for him,’ Knicks coach Mike D'Antoni said of the Heat defence on Lin. ‘And they took the challenge and they did a great job. It's hard to be Peter Pan every day.’ Point guard Lin described the game as a ‘learning experience’ and a ‘tough one’, in what was by far his worst performance since he came from obscurity to rescue a dire Knicks season with ‘Linsanity’. The scene was electric and the game matched the hype for much of the night. Director Spike Lee, boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr and New England Patriots NFL player Chad Ochocinco were all present.

He's a good player, but we put a lot of pressure on him and it was a success.’ 'I'm not going to hang my head or anything like that. I know I went out there and I played hard. Can't win 'em all. Can't have a great game every game' Jeremy Lin, New York Knicks . Mike Stanton and Logan Morrison of baseball team Miami Marlins were on a sideline together, and members of the New York Mets' front office reportedly arrived by helicopter from Port St. Lucie. ‘In another life, I would be staying for the Knicks-Heat game tonight, then going up to Orlando for NBA All-Star weekend,’ President Barack Obama said earlier in the day. ‘But these days, I've got a few other things on my plate. Just a few.’ When Air Force One was headed to Orlando for a Thursday night fundraiser, there were televisions tuned to Heat-Knicks on board. Outfought: Miami Heat forward LeBron James (6) shoots against New York Knicks center Tyson Chandler, left, while Heat's Chris Bosh (1) goes to the basket against the Knicks' Amare Stoudemire on Thursday night . Victorious: Miami Heat's LeBron James dribbles the ball in the first half of their NBA basketball game . ‘This has been about a three-week push for us and it's a good way to end before the break,’ Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ‘I think everyone in that locker room needs a handful of days. 'He's a good player, a really good player. And they're going to do some great things. But for us, we come in and take care of business' LeBron James, Miami Heat . The Heat defence wasn't geared just toward Lin, but rather slowing the entire Knicks' offensive. New York shot 39 per cent, turned the ball over 19 times and had 10 shots blocked. ‘He's a good player, a really good player,’ James said of Lin, whom he has talked up in the past. ‘And they're going to do some great things. But for us, we come in and take care of business.’ Early on, back and forth they went, just as everyone wanted. ‘It's always big when the Knicks come in,’ Bosh said. ‘They have that New York-Miami thing. The crowd enjoyed it. And we enjoyed it.’ Slam: Miami Heat's LeBron James hangs on the rim after his dunk near New York Knicks Tyson Chandler . On the sidelines: Boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr, left, and director Spike Lee, right, were both in attendance . It was a classic Knicks-Heat game, just like the famous playoff battles in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The average price for the game on the resale markets was over $700, by one estimate. 'I'm sure they were all geeked up for him. And they took the challenge and they did a great job. It's hard to be Peter Pan every day. It's one game. We're not there yet' Mike D'Antoni, New York Knicks coach . ‘It's one game,’ D'Antoni said. ‘We're not there yet. They're there. They're the team right now to beat for everybody. They're playing better than everybody. We're trying to get our team together.’ Lin said he was already eager for the second half to start. ‘I'm not going to hang my head or anything like that,’ he said. ‘I know I went out there and I played hard. Can't win 'em all. ‘Can't have a great game every game. But at the same time, I need to understand, “OK, what'd I do wrong? How can I improve?” I think that's going to be exciting.’ While ‘Linsanity’ has resulted in a media frenzy around the New York Knicks star, some reporting has been so racially-insensitive that one worker at ESPN was fired while another got suspended. In response to the outrage that the racist phrase 'chink in the armour' caused this week, the Asian American Journalists Association has published guidance on how to cover the breakout sensation. The group advises other journalists that Lin is ‘Asian American, not Asian (more specifically, Taiwanese American)’ and ‘to characterise him as a foreigner is both inaccurate and insulting’. Here is a list of phrases and comparisons to avoid when describing Lin, according to the group: . See video here .","Knicks went down 102-88 at American Airlines Arena in Florida last night .

"By . Kerry Mcqueeney . Last updated at 6:46 PM on 24th February 2012 . A woman with multiple sclerosis threw herself into a canal after begging her twin sister to help get her to the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland so she could end her life, an inquest heard. When her sister refused to pay for her flight to the Zurich clinic, Carol Hutchins rode in her wheelchair for two miles to throw herself in a canal. The inquest was told that the 53-year-old had tried to throw herself into the same canal, in Reading, Berkshire, the day before her death. Desperate: Carol Hutchins (left) begged her sister Ingrid Foan (right) to buy her a one-way ticket to the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland . However, a mechanism in her wheelchair had jammed, meaning she was unable to raise the seat high enough to pull herself over the fence and into the water. The failed attempt had made her so distraught she returned home in tears, a coroner's court in Windsor, Berkshire, was told. After fixing the faulty mechanism, Miss Hutchins returned to the Kennet and Avon Canal the following day and waited until workmen, who were cleaning graffiti nearby, went on a break before she tried again. Despite not having the use of her body from the waist down, she had enough strength to pull herself up over the fence and into the canal. When they returned, the workers found Miss Hutchins's body face down in the water and her empty wheelchair on the towpath. A police officer jumped over the fence and dragged her body from the water but, despite efforts to revive her, she was pronounced dead shortly after arriving at hospital. Happier times: Carol (middle) with her step-mother Jane and father Alec after completing a half marathon in 1993 . Controversial: The Dignitas clinic in Switzerland, which offers assisted suicide . Her cause of death was drowning, a post-mortem examination confirmed. Miss Hutchins was described as having a vibrant personality and being a keen marathon runner before her body was ravaged by the disease, the Berkshire coroner heard. The condition was diagnosed in 1989 had slowly stripped away her health. The Berkshire coroner heard that Carol . was diagnosed with MS in 1989 and had taken part in marathons before MS . ravaged her body and left her wheelchair bound. Her sister, Ingrid Foan, said that in . July 2010 her depressed sister was unable to do anything for herself . and begged her to buy a one way plane ticket to Switzerland so she could . end her life. She told the hearing: 'She was terrified by what was happening to her.' She told how her sister had said that . she had 'lost everything and didn't want to live like this anymore,' and . had previously spoken of throwing herself into the canal. Ms Foan explained that after a 10-week . hospital stay her sibling's condition had improved and she was able to . do much more for herself. Carol's devastated parents, Alec and . Ursula, said they believed their daughter had planned to end her life . before her condition worsened further and she could no longer control . her destiny. Mr Hutchins said: 'We think she planned it while she was in hospital. 'She didn't involve anyone else. She knew exactly what MS was and what it was doing to her.' When asked whether they thought Carol had taken her own life, Mr Hutchins replied: 'I'm in no doubt.' In recording his verdict coroner Peter Bedford said that Carol was suffering from a 'horrible' disease at the time of her death. 'From the evidence given to me I am . quite satisfied that Carol Hutchins died on October 22 last year at the . Royal Berkshire Hospital and that she took her own life while suffering . from multiple sclerosis and depression.' Speaking before the hearing Mr Hutchins called for assisted suicide to be legalised. He said: 'Carol was a very courageous . woman but at the end of the day she has demonstrated a need for . euthanasia in this country. 'People say life is precious but there comes a point when life is not precious and it becomes torture for those that are living. 'Carol had thought about going to . Dignitas in Switzerland but it is very expensive and it puts other . people in a difficult position. 'It showed tremendous courage for her . to do what she did all alone and I believe that she had planned it after . having enough of being a prisoner in her own home. 'She knew one more setback could leave . her totally immobilised and she wouldn't be able to do anything for . herself and she would just be washed, dressed and stuck in front of the . television.'","She begged her twin sister for money to fly to Switzerland .

"By . Emily Allen . Last updated at 2:01 AM on 25th February 2012 . The missing 7th Earl of Lucan, at a reception in July 1971. His brother is 'sure' he fled to Africa after the murder . The brother of Lord Lucan has broken his silence to reveal he thinks the famous fugitive vanished to Africa and might still be alive. Hugh Bingham said he was 'sure' the elusive aristocrat fled to start a new life after murdering his children's nanny Sandra Rivett, 29, in Belgravia, south west London in 1974. Theories regarding the elusive earl, who would now be 76, have been numerous and far-fetched over the 38 years he has been missing and he has been reportedly spotted in countries like South Africa, Australia and Ireland. When Mr Bingham was asked if he thought his brother had escaped to . Africa, he said: 'I'm sure he did, yes. But what connection there is I . don't know'. But Mr Bingham moved to South Africa to escape . the media glare after his brother vanished and now lives in . Johannesburg. Speaking to the Daily Mirror, he said he didn't want to speculate on where his brother is or was and whether he was dead or alive. Mr Bingham, who apparently bears a striking resemblance to Lucan, said the last contact he had with him was before the murder. Many police officers involved in the case believe he fled the country with the help of his wealthy friends. Others have suggested he committed suicide but no body has ever been found. However, Lord Lucan's wife Lady Veronica Lucan, believes her husband died the day after the murder by jumping off a ferry. The 72-year-old widow, who lives as a . virtual recluse at her home in London, rubbished claims he fled to . Africa saying 'it does not make sense'. Public face: Lord Lucan, pictured with his then fiancee Veronica Duncan, disappeared in November 1974 . She said he was 'not the sort of Englishman to cope abroad', adding . that he couldn't speak foreign languages and 'preferred English food.' The . revelations follow a BBC report on Inside Out this week where a former personal . assistant to Lucan’s friend, casino-owner and zoo-keeper John Aspinall, . claimed that not only was the peer living in Africa in the early . Eighties, but he also saw his children on at least two occasions. The . woman, named in the programme as Jill Findlay, says she arranged travel . tickets for Lucan’s eldest two children to travel to Kenya and then to . Gabon, where ‘their father would observe them... just to see how they . were growing up’. Lucan was officially declared dead by the High Court in 1999 . The British aristocrat was famously smuggled out of the country following the death of Sandra Rivett - the family's nanny - in 1974. Lucan, born Richard John Bingham in 1934, was officially declared dead by the High Court in 1999. He started gambling early in life and learned how to play poker during his national service years. In 1955, he got a job with a small merchant bank, William Brandts, for £500 a year. However, he retired in 1960 having won £26,000 over two nights playing 'chemin de fer' at a gambling party run by John Aspinall. But he would eventually accrue huge debts, before disappearing following Ms Rivett's death. Every few years, Lord Lucan is 'spotted' again - sometimes in Australia, sometimes in Africa, sometimes in the UK. However, Mr Bingham said he had no knowledge of that and admitted he has 'never really been in touch with them'. He said he is often asked to speak about the case but chooses not to. Lady Veronica Lucan, wife of Lord Lucan pictured in 1994 . Lucan had three children with Lady Lucan, Frances, George and Camilla. Lady Lucan, who lost custody of the children in 1982 following a breakdown, said it was 'ridiculous' to suggest the children went abroad and said she would have known if they had. She also questioned why the woman claims only Frances and George went abroad and not Camilla. She said her husband would have wanted to see all three children, whom she is no longer in touch with. Meanwhile, this week an antiques dealer . came across what he claims must be Lucan's watch which is believed to . have come from South Africa. Cedrick . Lincoln, 58, believes the watch with a chunky black strap which he . bought last week from another dealer for £5,000 could hold vital clues . as to what happened to Lucan. The other dealer claims that it was discovered in a South African township. Inscribed . on the underside of the watch is the message: 'Presented to Lord . ""Lucky' Lucan"" The Old Fossil' by his friends at the Clermont Club . Mayfair December 1967'. After some digging, Mr Lincoln found photographs of the aristocrat wearing a similar watch. The discovery supports claims that the fugitive fled to South Africa, where some believe he is still living. Sandra Rivett's body was found in the basement of Lucan's Belgravia house . At . 9.45pm, Lady Lucan, in great distress, burst into the Plumber’s Arms, . the pub near her home in the exclusive area of Belgravia in central . London. With blood . streaming from several wounds on her head, she cried: ‘Help me, help me, . help me! He’s in the house! He’s murdered my nanny!’ Lady Lucan, who was estranged from her husband, said he had killed their nanny and tried to kill her. Police found the couple’s three . children asleep in their beds, unharmed, and when they went to the . basement they were greeted by a macabre scene. The . basement lightbulb had been removed, but in the semi-darkness, officers . made out a pool of blood with a man’s footprint in it (a bloodied towel . was in a bathroom), a blood-stained length of lead piping and a mailbag . containing a body. The body was that of Sandra Rivett, the children’s live-in-nanny, who was the same height and build as Lady Lucan. According . to Lady Lucan — living apart from her husband and in a bitter custody . dispute over their children — she’d gone into the house to look for the . nanny, but was attacked by her husband, whom she recognised by his . voice, before managing to flee. When . she returned with police, Lucan was gone. After the attack, he went to . the home of friends, telling them he had found the nanny had been . murdered. He left his friends at 1.15am. Three days later his car was found . abandoned in Newhaven, East Sussex, with bloodstains on the front seat . and a length of lead piping matching the one found in the Belgravia . basement. There was . speculation that he had committed suicide, but no body was found. And . there were rumours that his gambling friends John Aspinall and . billionaire Jimmy Goldsmith had helped him flee the country . Two years later, Aspinall gave an . interview in which he said that if Lucan had sought his help he would . have given it unconditionally. By then, the inquest into Sandra . Rivett’s death had been held and Lucan was named as her murderer. The . missing peer was declared legally dead in 1999.

"By . Damien Gayle . Created 2:12 PM on 23rd February 2012 . A schoolgirl who suffers from a rare liver disorder must eat nearly twice her bodyweight in raw cornflour every year just to stay alive. Chrissie Augrandjean, from Clacton, Essex, is one of just a handful of children in the UK who suffer from glycogen storage disease. The disorder means the 12-year-old's body is unable to release glucose, which provides energy, from her liver. Yum: Chrissie Augrandjean, 12, with some of the boxes of cornflour she must guzzle constantly just to stop her from slipping into a coma and dying . There are no medicines that can tackle the rare condition so the youngster has to eat 250g of cornflour every day - equivalent to more than 91kg per year, nearly twice her weight. The starch in the cornflour creates a slow release of energy throughout the day, stopping Chrissie from slipping into a coma or suffering liver damage. In order to consume the dry powder, Chrissie must mix it with water and gulp down the gloopy mixture. Her mother Jacqui, 48, even has to set an alarm for a daily 2am dose so Chrissie’s body can continue to create energy throughout the night. Doctors diagnosed Chrissie with the rare disorder when, aged just three years old, she was rushed to Colchester General in terrible pain. 'Cornflour connoisseur': Chrissie with her mother Jacqui, 48, who is a voluntary worker with the NHS . Examining the youngster, specialists . found her liver had enlarged by about 6cm and suggested that she . might be suffering from glycogen storage disease. Experts at St Thomas’s Hospital, London confirmed the diagnosis of the condition which affects about only one in every three million people. For three years she had to be fed through a nasal gastric tube until her body was strong enough to just have the cornflour. Chrissie, who has an older brother, Frank, 17, who does not have the illness - takes her cornflour drink at 8am, 3pm, 8pm and then her dose in the night. Although she is now able to go to sleepovers with her friends, she still has to get up at 2am to have her glucose hit. She said: 'Some of the cornflour doses make me gag but I found the one that I like the best and just stick to that. 'I am just used to having to have it now and my friends are used to what I have to do. 'It sometimes gets a bit annoying but I guess I just get on with it.' Chrissie's mother, a voluntary worker with the NHS, said: 'Chrissie is amazing - she just gets on with it every day and does not ever complain. 'I hand her the drink, she knocks it back and then just carries on doing whatever she is doing at the time. 'She has even become a cornflour connoisseur and can tell which ones she likes and which ones make her feel ill. 'It’s just amazing how much of it she has to have every day but it means that she can live quite a normal life.' Chrissie faces the prospect of having to eat cornflour for the rest of her life although her family hope developments in gene therapy might one day offer a cure. Until then, they are able to claim back £22 per month from the NHS because the cornflour is deemed to be a treatment for her.",Chrissie Augrandjean suffers from rare glycogen storage disease .

The law is to be changed to stop councils blocking mixed-race adoptions as part of radical reforms to ensure children are removed from unfit parents more quickly. Education Secretary Michael Gove said there was ‘horrifying’ evidence that youngsters were being left in dangerous homes for too long. Mr Gove, who was adopted at four months, said he wants many more children to be adopted before the age of one. He said local councils were blocking potential adoptions purely because would-be parents were not the same race as the child. Mr Gove revealed yesterday that David Cameron has agreed to change the law to prevent such discrimination and to speed up the process. Of 3,600 children in care under the age of one, only 60 were adopted last year. Black children were three times less likely to find new parents than white ones. Mr Gove said he was deeply angered that falling numbers of adoptions – a 17 per cent decline in the last decade – meant a ‘cruel rationing of human love for those most in need’. The Education Secretary said couples were being turned down for trivial reasons, including one case in which a couple who had already adopted five children successfully could not take on another until they bought an electric kettle with a shorter lead. Other couples are being asked questions such as whether they have non-slip mats in the shower, and asked to fill out nine pages of forms about the potential risks posed by their pets. Mr Gove will publish an adoption plan next month to sweep away bureaucratic hurdles and make the process of finding a permanent home for children in care in England swifter, simpler and more flexible. Mr Gove revealed how one couple was banned from adopting because their kettle flex was too long, in violation of safety rules . Speaking in London, he said that despite guidelines issued a year ago, local councils are still refusing to approve interracial adoptions. Mr Gove said: ‘There are a number of local authorities which have put their belief in creating a perfect match ahead of the interests of children, a number of local authorities on whose websites you can see clearly policies that show they want to have ethnicity taken into account ahead of other factors that are more important in the interests of the child. We will be legislating.’ He conceded that few aspects of the adoption process are as politically sensitive as that of ethnicity and said that in an ideal world, an ethnic match between adopters and a child was a bonus. ‘But the reality is that a black child is three times less likely to be adopted from care than a white child,’ he added. ‘If there is a loving family, ready and able to adopt a child, issues of ethnicity must not stand in the way.’ Mr Gove said he wanted to ‘radically’ increase the number of adoptive parents, suggesting parents with their own children, heterosexual and homosexual couples unable to have children of their own, and single individuals, both men and women, should come forward. He said it was clear that the earlier a child is adopted, the greater the chances of success. Only 2 or 3 per cent of arrangements break down when a child joins new parents before the age of one, he added. Mr Gove said it was better to take a child into care than allow it to be abused, but there was ‘horrifying’ evidence that social workers and other officials are often reluctant to remove a child from unfit parents. He highlighted research which found cases of a baby whose parents ‘so persistently forgot to feed her that she ceased to cry’, a two-year-old left to forage in the waste bin for food and a three-year-old ‘who could accurately demonstrate how heroin is prepared’. ‘All these children remained with their birth parents for many months without being taken into care,’ said Mr Gove. ‘Who knows how much damage they suffered, and how many children like them are suffering still? ‘This cannot be allowed to continue. The welfare of a neglected or abused child is more important than the rights of their parents, more important than the schedules of the courts, more important than ticking boxes on forms and much more important than the old saw that blood is thicker than water.’","Education Secretary youngsters are left in dangerous homes for too long .

"By . Suzannah Hills . Last updated at 4:48 PM on 25th February 2012 . After a spell of beautifully mild weather over the last few days, residents in Cambridge were stunned to see a field of crocuses suddenly bloom to life. The Mediterranean plant, often known as the Snow Crocus, traditionally blossoms in February after the snowdrops and before the daffodils. But gardeners feared the flower would fail to materialise this year because of the unusually cold weather and late-falling snow.

Blooming marvelous: Cambridge was just one of many places across the UK to witness a sudden flower bloom . Beautiful: Springs appears well on the way as Mediterranean Snow Crocus flower on time . Their fears were put at rest today though as the plant showed its resilience after hundreds of the violet flowers bloomed to create a stunning purple carpet along The Backs by Trinity College in Cambridge. Onlookers stopped to admire the view of the lilac woodland crocus, also known as Crocus Tommasinianus, which has bloomed across the iconic city landscape in the balmy 16c heat. Head gardeners at Cambridge University colleges had feared that recent heavy snowfall would damage the plants' growth. Dennis Footman, head gardener at Trinity College, said: 'Initially, I was slightly worried that the heavy snowfall in the last month would have been too heavy for the crocuses to grow. But they have come through nicely bringing through a lot colour.' But across the country, spring seemed well on its way today as flowers came out in force, as temperatures remained above the average 6c to 8c for this time of year.

And this appears just to be the start of fine weather to come as forecasters predict March will see temperatures rise to 27c. Temperatures in the south today reached around 14c to 12c and even northern parts of the country reached the very early teens. And while tonight and the start of tomorrow should remain dry for most, temperatures will drop to average for this time of year at around 6c to 8c, with rain expected at the beginning of next week.

'It may rain in northern parts tomorrow into Monday morning but it should then start to brighten up again. 'The weather system is coming in from the Atlantic which is relatively warm this time of year but also brings a lot of moisture in with it.

'Flood is also charged with robbery in connection with an incident in Janes Brook Road on Saturday, February 18. 'He has been remanded in custody to appear at South Sefton Magistrates' Court this morning.' Both victims' families issued short statements through Merseyside Police last night. Mrs Leyland's son, Philip, said: . 'Firstly, I am co-operating with the police to help them carry out their . duty and I would appeal to anyone with information to come forward.

Mrs Leyland, also a widow, was described by neighbours as very frail and reliant on a walking stick to move around. She is believed to have worked as a . catalogue model in her younger years and, after retiring, took regular . foreign trips with her husband, Eric, until his death in 2005 at 83.

Four police officers were killed today when Taliban suicide bombers armed with assault rifles and grenades attacked a large police station in the north-west of the country. The murderous assault, which also left six officers wounded, was to avenge the death of a militant commander in a U.S. drone strike. The attack in the city of Peshawar was the latest in a spasm of violence in the area, showing that Pakistani Taliban militants retain the capacity to strike.

The murderous assault, which also left six officers wounded, was to avenge the death of a militant commander in a U.S. drone strike . The army has claimed success in its fight against the militants, who are behind five years of violence in the country, but the insurgents have proved resilient. Peshawar has been a frequent target of militant attacks over the last few years, but most have been bomb blasts, not coordinated assaults in the centre of the city. City police chief Imtiaz Altaf said three militants entered the compound after attacking the main gate, then blew themselves up when police returned fire. He said: 'They wanted to occupy this police station, but they failed.' There were more than 370 policemen at the station at the time of the assault, said provincial Information Minister Iftikhar Hussain. The number of policemen was so high because authorities send graduates of the police training academy to the station for 18 months before stationing them at other posts.

Pakistani Taliban spokesman Ahsanullah Ahsan said the attack was carried out by an affiliated group, the Abdullah Azzam Brigade. Abu Zarar, a man who claimed to be a spokesman for the Abdullah Azzam Brigade, also claimed that the group executed the attack. He said it was in response to the death of one of the group's commanders, Badar Mansoor, in a U.S. drone strike on February 9. Mansoor served as a key link between the Pakistani Taliban and Al-Qaeda. He led a group of over 200 Pakistani Taliban fighters in the North Waziristan tribal area, where he was killed. Ahsan, the Taliban spokesman, denied the group carried out a car bombing that killed 12 people at an outdoor minibus terminal in Peshawar on Thursday.

"By . Lydia Warren, Eleanor Gower and Beth Stebner . Last updated at 8:09 PM on 24th February 2012 . Celebrity chef and Food Network personality Paula Deen says that some people ‘were kinda mean’ about her diagnosis, after she publically revealed she has type-2 diabetes. The queen of Southern cuisine drew ire from many in the health and culinary worlds when she announced that nearly three years before, she had been diagnosed with the disease. But all the while, she was promoting highly caloric and indulgent dishes, and appeared to hold her announcement until she had a paying endorsement. Scroll down for videos . Hurtful words: Paula Deen said some people were 'kinda mean' after she announced her struggles with diabetes . ‘Yes, I am being compensated,’ Deen told the Associated Press today at the South Beach Wine and Food Festival. However, she calls the decision ‘the . way of the world’ and ‘the American way.’ Deen said she received much criticism . from those around her. ‘I think a few people who have access to a TV . camera and ink kind of wanted to hate on me for coming down with . something,’ she told AP, adding that she’s simply shrugged it off. Deen, now 65, revealed to the Today . show’s Al Rocker last month that she has been struggling with the . disease for more than two and a half years. Spotted last month chowing down on a . cheeseburger, Deen vows to eat healthier, but says it would be . impossible to cut out all the butter and bacon from her famously . indulgent recipes. Love of food: Deen has said the one food she could not live without is butter . ‘I am who I am,’ she told AP, ‘But what I will be doing is offering up lighter versions of my recipes.’ Deen added that she’s giving a . portion of the remuneration she recieves for endorsing the diabetes medicine to the American Diabetes Association. She told the Today show that she has . ‘broad shoulders’ to deal with people’s negative comments and says her . long life has been ‘a blessing.’ Type 2 diabetes is a long-term condition caused by too much glucose, a type of sugar, in the blood. It is often associated with obesity. In those with the condition, the body is unable to break down glucose into energy as there is either not enough insulin to move the glucose, or because the insulin that is there does not work properly. The symptoms, such as tiredness and weight loss, can be controlled by eating a healthy diet and monitoring the blood glucose level. Insulin medication, usually in the form of tablets, also controls the condition. Around 25 million in the United States have diabetes, with around 90 per cent having Type 2. ‘I feel like God has given me a . blessing, because my mother and daddy died very young,’ she said. ‘I’m . so proud that I lived long enough…to deal with something like this.’ The condition, linked to obesity, is a . result of genetic factors and lifestyle choices. It is a result of the . body not producing enough insulin or failing to use it efficiently, . allowing excess sugar to build up in the blood. It can be managed by making lifestyle changes, such as exercising more and lowering blood sugars by altering the diet. It . might come as little surprise that the condition has affected a chef . whose signature dishes include bacon, egg and a burger between a . doughnut. And in an . interview with the Today Show last year, the mother-of-two revealed she . could never live without butter or her deep-fat fryer. But speaking about her diagnosis, the 'Queen of Southern cuisine' said people should take her recipes with a pinch of salt. 'I've always encouraged moderation,' she said. 'People see me cooking all these wonderful, Southern, . fattening recipes... it's for entertainment. People have to be . responsible.' Speaking with Al Roker, Paula revealed how she told Oprah Winfrey to exercise the same sort of responsibility. Signature dish: One of Deen's recipes is a Lady's Brunch Burger that features doughnuts in place of buns, bacon, a beef burger and a fried egg . 'Like I told Oprah, ""Honey, I'm your cook, not your doctor,""' she said. 'You have to be responsible.' When asked if her high-fat recipes can lead to diabetes, she said: 'That is part of the puzzle.' She added that there are other factors, including genetics, lifestyle, stress and age. 'When your signature dish is hamburger . in between a doughnut, and you've been cheerfully selling this stuff . knowing all along that you've got type-2 diabetes, it's bad . taste if nothing else.' -Anthony Bourdain . To deal with the condition, she is 'making lifestyle adjustments, including lightened-up versions of her favourite recipes'. Although it was rumoured Paula had the condition in April 2010, last week was the first time she confirmed it. In 2010, Paula earned just under $10 million from her television shows, recipe books, endorsements, retail sales and speaking fees, based on figures by New York Magazine. It suggests she could have earned around $30 million in the time since she was diagnosed. Some of Paula's peers have questioned her judgement in keeping her own diagnosis quiet. Fellow chef Anthony Bourdain, who is often outspoken on other cooking show celebrities, told Eater.com: 'When your signature dish is hamburger . in between a doughnut, and you've been cheerfully selling this stuff . knowing all along that you've got type-2 diabetes, it's bad . taste if nothing else.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 8:46 PM on 24th February 2012 . More than 100 officers in the land of 10,000 lakes have been using their police databases to ogle a single female employee, it has been revealed. An investigation into Minnesota’s Dakota County Sheriff’s office, as well as state troopers and Bloomington police show that the law enforcement officers were using the database as their own personal Facebook, looking up pictures of Anne Marie Rasmusson, a fellow officer. According to an audit, 24 officers accessed the database of the blonde-haired, green-eyed officer an astounding 133 times. Violated: Officers used their private database to look up Anne Marie Rasmusson's driver's licence photo, right, more than 400 times since 2007. She's seen pictured with her husband, left . Toned: Rasmusson began entering body building competitions after she was forced into medical retirement, losing more than 70 pounds . The investigation, as originally reported by Minnesota’s independent paper City Pages, shows that officers –from chiefs on down – have been using the system as little more than their personal database. Ms Rasmusson, a 37-year-old retired cop, stands at a petite 5ft2 and has her hair trimmed short. Officers are only supposed to look someone up for official reasons. That said, the incredible misuse of the database is astounding – City Pages found that 104 officers in 18 different state agencies accessed her driver’s licence record 425 times. She told City Pages: ‘There is nothing that I would say about this driver’s licence photo or any of my previous ones that in any way would deserve the attention that they’ve gotten.’ Breech of trust: Rasmusson, right, said she felt her privacy was violated and got sick after she found out how many times her personal data was accessed . Ms Ramusson told the paper that she feels her privacy has been violated. When she found out to what degree, she actually became ill. One officer, who requested that he not be named, said that every cop – regardless of rank – had looked at her file. When she was 24 and new to the St Paul police force, one of her co-workers suggested a bet – who could lose the most body fat in three months. She dropped 15 pounds in three months, and continued her regimen of exercise and healthy eating until she dropped an additional 70 pounds. Questions: She became suspicious after several acquaintances called her up out of the blue and asked her out on dates . An injury in 2003 forced Ms Ramusson to go into early retirement, but the determined fitness guru continued working out, and began entering body building competitions while her husband – another Minnesota officer – went to work. She became suspicious when a former academy friend said she looked great in her driver’s licence photo. Then unsolicited texts from other officers trickled in, requesting her company on boating excursions. Tired of the texts, she insisted on an audit, and the results were shocking. Her personal data – including her address, phone number, and driver’s licence information – had been accessed repeatedly by officers since 2007. If federal privacy laws swing in her favour, all 104 officers who viewed her profile could lose their jobs.","Officers used private database to look up Anne Marie Rasmusson more 425 times since 2007 .

His parents raised the alarm when he failed to return home with his grandmother . The parents of a six-year-old boy who drowned during an outing to feed the ducks with his grandmother have spoken for the first time of their heartbreak. Schoolboy Laurence Mullany-Mills and Dawn Mullany, 71, drowned in a freezing lake during a half-term day out together. Asmina Mullany-Mills and her husband Vaughan said the double tragedy had left 'a hole in our lives that can never be filled' as they spoke out for the first time. The couple raised the alarm when Laurence and his grandmother failed to return home. Police later found Mrs Mullany's house empty and her car left near the duck pond in Holywell, Lincolnshire. Their bodies were later pulled from the lake. Police believe that Laurence may have accidentally fallen into the water before his grandmother jumped in to help him. However, as no one witnessed the incident it will never be known what actually happened. Asmina and Vaughan, both 41, said in a statement: 'Dawn was adored by all. She was a great friend, a loving mother and above all, a doting and devoted grandmother. Her passion and affection for life will never be forgotten. 'Laurence was a gentle and caring brother to Nancy. He was a son with a wonderfully infectious smile who could warm the coldest place or light the darkest room. 'He had a limitless, bristling and bubbly enthusiasm for the new, and a burning curiosity to get involved with everything and anything, whether taking to the stage or the rugby field.' They added that their son - also known as Laurie - had a 'special relationship' with his grandmother who lived nearby. Dawn Mullany lived in Castle Bytham, Lincolnshire, two miles away from the lake where he drowned. She was due to take him back to his home in Ketton, Rutland, on Thursday last week, but they never made it. The . boy's parents added: 'Laurie and Dawn could not have been closer as . grandmother and grandson. At the core of their special relationship was a . shared love of fun and laughter. 'Their . death leaves a hole in our lives that can never be filled. We will all . have our own happy and special memories of the two of them, and we will . ensure these memories never fade but burn more brightly than ever . before.

'We wish to express our most sincere gratitude and thanks to our family, friends and the community for, their gifts, their support and their love during this most testing of times. 'We, their family and friends are going to need time and above all space. Time and space will help us to take the small steps that will enable us to move forward as a family. These small steps will, over time, allow us to focus on the knowledge and love of what we had, and not what we have lost.' The couple also have a daughter who is 15 months old. Laurence was a pupil at Ketton Church of England Primary School. The family had recently returned from a holiday in New Zealand to spend Christmas with Vaughan's family. Mrs Mullany was described by her . neighbours as ‘a sweet, lovely lady’ who had lived in the village of . Castle Bytham,  Lincolnshire, for around 30 years. They . told how she had suffered tragedy in her life, including the death of . her father in wartime action in 1943 when she was a baby. In 1977, her husband, Firozali, died aged just 35.

"Last updated at 3:49 PM on 25th February 2012 . The head of Britain's biggest drugs company has accused the Government of systematically delaying the introduction of new cancer drugs in order to save money. GlaxoSmithKline chief executive Sir Andrew Witty warned that ministers were making false economies as they tried to grapple with the deficit in the public finances. In an interview with the BBC, he said that governments across Europe had already cut drug prices by 5 per cent a year - costing GSK around £300 million per annum. Warning: Sir Andrew Witty, head of GSK, warns that government attempts to save money by delaying the introduction of new drugs is a false economy . However, he said governments were now seeking to go further in an effort to achieve even bigger savings - and he highlighted Britain's decision to delay new cancer treatments. 'The bit I'm much more frightened about is that what's now beginning to become clear is that, in addition to price reductions, governments are delaying the approval of innovative new drugs,' he said. 'So a second way they can save money, they think, is 'Let's just not buy the next round of innovation'. 'Cancer in the UK is a good example where we're seeing oncology drugs being systematically delayed from introduction and reimbursement. 'We are seeing a variety of the more innovative and more expensive medicines being delayed in a whole series of different diseases across Europe.' Not an option: the drug Avastin, made by the firm Roche to treat breast cancer, was one of the drugs rejected by Nice and is therefore not available on the NHS . Sir Andrew accused governments of treating the pharmaceuticals industry as a 'simple procurement business' without understanding the wider implications of their decisions. 'As governments have got more and more anxious about their debt positions and austerity agendas, what happened is quite predictable,' he said. 'If you are a minister and you need to cut costs, it is a lot easier to cut drug prices than it is to close a hospital or reduce the size of the Civil Service. I understand that. 'The issue here is, of course, if you don't buy the new drug it is going to save you money in the drug bill. But the drug bill is only 8 per cent to 10 per cent of the total healthcare bill and what is being lost in this stampede for cost cut is any kind of strategic thoughtfulness.' Professor Jonathan Waxman, of Imperial College London, said a number of new cancer drugs had been blocked by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice), which assesses the cost-effectiveness of new treatments. Rough treatment: Professor Waxman said Nice had blocked a number of new cancer drugs . 'In my view, Nice has over-regulated and proscribed drugs that offer real advances to people with cancer,' he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. 'In my particular area of specialisation, which is prostate cancer, we have had two new drugs become available over the last year and a half which offer real benefits for patients. 'I would argue that they have been disallowed - banned - by Nice on the basis of an assessment which is not a true financial costing of the worth of the drugs.' He warned that drug companies may soon no longer find it worthwhile to seek approval for their products in Britain. 'The regulation is such in this country that it is not worthwhile for the drug companies making the effort of actually negotiating with our regulatory authorities for the sale of their products in the UK. It is a complete loss-leader for them - waste of time,' he said. 'We are going to have a situation in the UK where drugs are not available for our patients. It is a disaster. Someone just needs to sort this out.' A Department of Health spokesman hit back at the criticism of its spending and of the decisions taken by Nice. He said: 'The Government has increased spending on health, which includes new drugs, and thousands more patients are getting access to the most advanced treatments. 'This includes the 11,000 extra patients who have benefited from the setting up of our £650 million Cancer Drugs Fund. 'The need for careful assessment of drugs' effectiveness by Nice is particularly important for patients and taxpayers during a time of economic austerity. 'The Government has not changed any assessment processes relating to cancer drugs. 'Furthermore, drug companies need to look hard at the high costs they are asking of the health service for their latest treatments.' Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham accused David Cameron of breaking his General Election commitment to cancer patients. ""With a great fanfare, he said he would deliver quicker access to drugs for cancer patients. Today we hear that his Government is in fact delaying new treatments to save money,"" he said. ""If true, this is a shameful state of affairs and a false economy. The Prime Minister must be kept to his pre-election promises.""","UK is delaying the approval of new treatments .

Free: Gordon Wood, pictured outside court during his 2008 trial over the murder of his girlfriend in Sydney, has now had his conviction quashed . A British-born playboy is to spend his first weekend of freedom in four years after dramatically winning his appeal today for the murder of a Sydney model who he was said to have tossed to her death from a Sydney cliff. Court officials ordered that 50-year-old Gordon Wood, who was born in Somerset, should be released from prison in New South Wales immediately. Three appeal court judges said there was insufficient evidence to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Wood had killed his 24-year-old model girlfriend Caroline Byrne, 16 years ago. Wood had been extradited from England, where he was working, to face trial after police investigating the death of Miss Byrne - whose body was found at the foot of a 100ft cliffside suicide spot at the entrance to Sydney harbour in June 1995 - concluded she had been thrown to her death. Members of Wood's family were in the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal when the verdict was handed down. One of his sisters who was present, Michele Wood, said afterwards: 'It's just a relief, that's what it is.' His . other sister, Jacqueline Schmidt, added: 'Relieved is an . understatement. It's been a very long journey that I wouldn't wish on . anybody.' Wood's solicitor . Michael Bowe, who phoned his client at Goulburn Prison to give him the . news, told the Sydney Morning Herald later: 'He was overwhelmed. 'He went very quiet. I don't he could quite believe it,' he said.'It's been a long time coming.' Relief: Mr Wood had spent four years in jail after being convicted of throwing model Caroline Byrne (left) over a 100ft cliff in June 1995 . Perilous: The notorious suicide spot of The Gap at the entrance to Sydney harbour where Miss Byrne met her death . Wood was expected to be released from prison within hours of the verdict. During Wood's trial in Sydney in 2008, . Prosecutor Mark Tedeschi QC said that Miss Byrne could only have landed . 'wedged like a spear' between rocks if she was thrown from the top of . the cliffs by a strong male. A . police rescue squad officer, Mark Powderly, also told the court at the . time that the state of Miss Byrne's body - lacking any injuries to her . legs or body - was unlike any of the other ten to 20 victims he had . recovered from the scene, known as The Gap. The . jury was told during the three-month trial that Wood had killed his . girlfriend because she knew too much about the personal life and . questionable business affairs of a multi-millionaire Sydney stockbroker, . Rene Rivkin. Unusual case: The trial heard that Miss Byrne's injuries were unlike any of the other victims that had been recovered from the spot over the years . Wood was born in Bath, Somerset, but . had emigrated from England to South Africa with his parents before the . family moved to Australia. There the tall, muscular fitness . fanatic led a charmed life as an actor, an aerobics instructor and . man-about-town with beautiful women on his arm. But . there were also claims that he was bisexual and had had a torrid affair . with multi-millionaire stockbroker Rene Rivkin, who committed suicide . with a drugs overdose after he was convicted of insider trading. As murder inquiries following the discovery of Miss Byrne's body turned towards Wood, he fled Australia. But he was eventually arrested in a flat in London, where he had landed a job at NatWest bank with a fictitious work history as a financial adviser. Found guilty of Miss Byrne's murder, he was sentenced to a minimum of 13 years in jail - but now, four years later, he is a free man. The Court of Criminal Appeal decided today that the evidence presented to the jury in 2008 was flawed and Wood's conviction was unsafe. There was insufficient evidence, said the three judges, to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Wood had killed Miss Byrne, although, they said, it was unclear how she fell to her death or whether Wood had any involvement.","Gordon Wood convicted of murdering girlfriend in 2008 .

"By . Lee Moran . Last updated at 3:06 PM on 24th February 2012 . Apple could be about to dip into its $98billion fortune and pay its shareholders a dividend for the first time in 17 years. New CEO Tim Cook, who took over from Steve Jobs, said he believed the world's most valuable company now has more money than it needs. And he revealed the board is deciding whether to break from the cash-hoarding ways of his predecessor - who suspended shareholder payments in 1995 when the firm was in such deep trouble it needed to hold on to every cent. Break with tradition: Apple's new CEO Tim Cook (left) could pay shareholders for the first time since Steve Jobs (right) suspended the payments in 1995 when the firm was financially at rock bottom . Pondering: Tim Cook, pictured here at the launch of the iPhone 4s in October 2011, said the board was thinking 'very deeply' about the move . Things got so bad that Apple turned to rival Microsoft in 1997 for a $150 million infusion to stay afloat. Microsoft came to the rescue at the same time Apple named Jobs, who died in October, as its CEO - a decision that turned out to be one of the smartest business moves ever made. Haunted by memories of Apple's grim times, Jobs kept accumulating cash even as the company's fortunes soared during the final decade of his life. Cook, though, appears willing to return some of the cash to shareholders since he succeeded Jobs as Apple's CEO last August. He said, during a question-and-answer session at the firm's annual shareholders' meeting yesterday: 'We are thinking about this very deeply. 'This isn't a case where 100 percent of people are going to agree with what we do. But, frankly speaking, it's more than we need to run the company.' Valuable: Apple, which has stores across the world, now has a market valuation of $480 billion - more than the combined value of Microsoft and prominent rival Google . One Apple shareholder, Asif Khan of Sugar Land, Texas, urged Cook to resist committing to a dividend every three months. He said it makes more sense for Apple to pay a one-time dividend later this year before the expiration of a provision that limits the federal tax rate on dividends to 15 per cent. If Apple opts for a regular quarterly dividend, Khan is worried it might be misinterpreted by some investors as a sign that Apple is losing confidence in its ability to keep propelling its stock price higher as the company churns out hit products such as the iPhone and iPad. Apple is facing yet another challenge to its use of the iPad trademark in China - but this time in a court in California. A Proview Electronics spokesman said the company filed a lawsuit against Apple's use of the trademark inside mainland China in the Santa Clara Superior Court on February 17. An attempt by Proview to win an injunction to stop Apple from selling iPads in Shanghai was foiled this week. A court there rejected the case pending the resolution of a similar lawsuit in a higher court in China. Apple had no immediate direct comment on the California lawsuit. The companies are feuding over whether Proview sold the mainland Chinese rights to the iPad trademark to Apple in a 2009 deal. During the past year, Apple's stock has surged 50 per cent to create about $160 billion in shareholder wealth. Apple now has a market value of $480 billion - more than the combined value of Microsoft and prominent rival Google. Apple shares gained $3.35 yesterday to close at $516.39. The high price sparked a question about whether Apple plans to split its stock to make it more affordable to buy. Cook indicated it is unlikely to occur, saying the board has studied the history of other companies that regularly split their stock and concluded 'it does nothing' for long-term returns. Apple last split its stock seven years ago. The shares have increased 11-fold since then. Although most of those gains occurred under Jobs' leadership, Apple's stock and financial results have remained stellar under Cook, Job's hand-picked successor. Cook has worked as a top Apple executive since 1998. Given how well Apple has been doing, shareholders had little reason to complain at yesterday's hour-long meeting. While shareholders waited in a 40-minute line to get inside the meeting at Apple's Cupertino headquarters, a few protesters carried signs urging the company to ensure that workers building its products in Taiwanese and Chinese factories are paid more and treated humanely. 'Stop iSweatshop,' one sign implored. Another stated: 'iWant an ethical phone.' No questions about the conditions in Apple's overseas factories were posed during the meeting. In other matters, Apple agreed to adopt a proposal from the public pension fund Calpers that will require all of the company's directors to receive a majority of shareholder votes to remain on the board. The proposal was backed by more than 80 per cent of the shareholder votes counted in the preliminary results announced by Apple Thursday. All eight of Apple's current directors were re-elected with at least 81 per cent of the shareholder votes in the preliminary results, so the switch to majority-voting rules wouldn't have changed this year's outcome if the new rules had already been in effect.","Boss Tim Cook says the firm now has 'more money than it needs'

"By . Associated Press . Last updated at 12:54 PM on 25th February 2012 . A prosecutor told jurors Friday that it was no mistake that a Rutgers student used a webcam to spy on his roommate's intimate encounter with another man. 'The defendant's acts were deliberately planned to invade Tyler's privacy,' First Assistant Middlesex County Prosecutor Julia McClure told jurors to open the hate crime trial of Dharun Ravi, 'and to deprive him of his dignity.' 'They were planned to expose Tyler Clementi's sexual orientation and they were planned to expose Tyler Clementi's private sexual activity,' she said. The trial: Former Rutgers University student, Dharun Ravi arrives for the opening arguments at his trial in New Brunswick, New Jersey today . Hate crime: Ravi is facing 15 charges, including invasion of privacy, after he posted webcam video of his roommate Tyler Clementi (pictured) kissing a man . Nineteen-year-old Ravi faces 15 criminal charges, including invasion of privacy and bias intimidation, a hate crime punishable by up to ten years in state prison. The case spurred a national conversation about how young gays are treated when news of it broke in September 2010 after Ravi's roommate, Tyler Clementi, committed suicide. In her half-hour opening statement, McClure did not mention Clementi's suicide. Ravi's lawyer was expected to give his opening statement later Friday morning, likely saying that Ravi meant no harm. That's a position McClure tried to dispel preventatively. 'The defendant's acts were not a prank, they were not an accident and they were not a mistake,' she said. 'They were mean-spirited, they were malicious and they were criminal.' She also said that Ravi began telling friends that he was unhappy he'd have a gay roommate soon after he received his Rutgers housing assignment in August 2010. Proceedings: A prosecutor and defense lawyer will make their initial pitches to jurors Friday in the trial of Ravi, (centre) the former Rutgers University student accused of using a webcam to spy on his roommate's intimate encounter with another man . High profile: The case spurred a national conversation about how young gays are treated when news of it broke in September 2010 after Ravi's roommate, Tyler Clementi, committed suicide . The case was so well known that it took four days to seat a jury of 16 — including four alternates. The first witness called by prosecutors was Austin Chung, a high school friend of Ravi's who testified that Ravi told him about seeing Clementi 'making out with some dude' via webcam. On cross-examination, Chung, a student at Stevens Institute of Technology, said he didn't know Ravi to have a problem with gay people. Three other witnesses, all Rutgers students, followed Chung on the stand. Plea: Molly Wei was charged with Dharun Ravi with invading the privacy of Tyler Clementi but made a plea deal that forces her to testify against Ravi . Altman asked each if they knew Ravi to speak against gays. All said he didn't. But one, Cassandra Cicco, said Ravi told her that he streamed the video to see whether Clementi was gay - as he suspected. 'He said he didn't have any problem with homosexuals and in fact he had a really good friend who was homosexual,' Cicco said. She said she and a group of a . half-dozen students were shown a one-second snippet of streaming video. She wanted to see it, she said, out of curiosity. She said that there were two men in the view and at least one had his shirt off. 'Someone pressed ""end"" on the feed and it ended abruptly and we're like, that happened,' she said. Another student who lived in the dorm said Ravi told him he'd seen Clementi with another man on his webcam. 'It was pretty crazy and scandalous,' Alvin Artha said. 'He described the guy he invited over as older. And . that was more the scandalous part than that he had invited another . male.' To convict Ravi of bias intimidation, prosecutors would need to show he acted because he was anti-gay. Just . before opening statements, one more juror was excused after telling the . judge that he needed to change an answer he'd given in a questionnaire. The judge didn't offer any further explanation. The trial is going forward because Ravi, 19, rejected a plea bargain offer that would have let him avoid any jail time and receive the state's help if federal authorities tried to deport him to India, where he was born. Roommates: Ravi and Clementi were roommates at Rutgers University in New Jersey . Lawyer Steven Altman said the reason for not accepting the deal was simple: He's not guilty of any crimes. If . the other man in the video is brought to the witness stand, his . testimony could become a key part of the trial. He's been identified . publicly only by the initials M.B. The trial is expected to last three to four weeks. 'Roommate asked for the room till . midnight. I went into molly's room and turned on my webcam. I saw him . making out with a dude. Yay.' -Twitter message posted by Dharun Ravi in 2010 . The . main alleged crime happened just weeks after Clementi, a violinist from . Ridgewood, and Ravi, an Ultimate Frisbee player from Plainsboro, moved . into their dorm room at Rutgers. Clementi's . parents said he told them he was gay in the days before he left for . Rutgers. But court filings show that Ravi already knew that from . Clementi's web postings. Authorities . say Ravi used the webcam on his computer to check on Clementi when he'd . asked to have the room to himself so he could have company. Ravi . posted a Twitter message about it: 'Roommate asked for the room till . midnight. I went into molly's room and turned on my webcam. I saw him . making out with a dude. Yay.' Initially, another first-year Rutgers student, Molly Wei, of Princeton Junction, was also charged in the case. But she entered a pre-trial intervention program last year that allows her to avoid jail time and emerge without a criminal record if she meets a list of conditions for three years. She also agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in their case against Ravi. Two nights after the first alleged spying incident, authorities say Ravi tried to do the same thing when Clementi asked him to stay away from the room again. A day after that, Clementi jumped from the George Washington Bridge, leaving behind a terse Facebook status updated: 'Jumping off the gw bridge, sorry.' The trial is expected to delve into text messages, tweets and online chats from Clementi and Ravi.","Dharun Ravi, 19, posted webcam footage of Rutgers University roommate Tyler Clementi sharing an intimate moment with another man .

"By . Jill Reilly . Last updated at 5:07 PM on 24th February 2012 . A Tunisian newspaper publisher has been freed on bail after printing a racy photo of Real Madrid football player Sami Khedira covering the breasts of his model girlfriend, Lena Gercke. Nassridine Ben Saida, publisher of the daily newspaper, Attounissia, was arrested on February 15  after publishing the cover of GQ along with the editor and one of the paper’s journalists. He was released by the Primary Court of Tunis earlier today and his trial on charges of violating public decency has been postponed until March 8. The offending photo: A Tunisian newspaper publisher has been released from jail after printing a photo of Real Madrid football player Sami Khedira covering the breasts of his model girlfriend, Lena Gercke . Arrested: Nassridine Ben Saida, left,  publisher of the . daily newspaper, Attounissia, was arrested on February 15 after . printing the cover of GQ  in the newspaper, right, along with the editor and one of the paper’s . journalists . The controversial photo showed the German-Tunisian football . player Sami Khedira dressed in a tuxedo with his hands . covering the breasts of his naked German model girlfriend, . Lena Gercke. During yesterday's hearing he sought to violate moral decency by publishing the photo in the newspaper's February 15 edition. 'I had no intention of infringing moral decencies. This is about a well-known footballer and in addition, the photo had an artistic dimension,' he said. One of his lawyers, Abderraouf Ayadi, told the court that 'there is nothing to justify the arrest of my client, especially since the copies of newspapers were quickly recalled from the stands.' Another lawyer, Chokri Belaid, said the arrest was a 'political decision.' 'We know that at the moment in Tunisia, there is a combat between those who defend freedom and those who want to repress it,' he said. Disappointment: After the publisher's arrest over the GQ photo of footballer Sami Khedira and his model girlfriend Lena Gercke, left, the footballer said he found it 'very, very sad and unfortunate' 'This trial is a major test for . Tunisian justice, which we call on to show its independence and prove . that it is not just applying any instructions,' he added. Footballer Sami Khedira is popular in the Islamic state because his father is Tunisian, but . the arrest has sparked a national debate in the country about the limits of . freedom of expression and how the government should decide on issues . they regard as immoral. ‘I heard about the matter on Thursday . evening and find it very, very sad and unfortunate that such a thing . happened,' the 24-year-old Khedira told German newspaper Bild. 'I respect the different religions that exist and also the faith that . people have, but I cannot understand that people cannot express . themselves freely.' Several of Nassridine Ben Saida's colleagues showed up in the packed court to support him. Tunisian national figures including Constituent Assembly member Salma Baccar and Hamma Hammami, head of the Tunisian Communist Party, as well as human rights activist Radhia Nasraoui. Mokhtar Trifi, a renowned Tunisian human rights activist and lawyer, called the arrest illegitimate and said that the detention occurred due to orders from above. He deemed the trial a test case for the Tunisian Judicial system. Last week, The Union of Tunisian Journalists expressed its disappointment over the decision of the preliminary court against the release of Mr Ben Saida. After his arrest, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) released a statement demanding his immediate release, in which they called Mr Ben Saida 'the first media executive to be jailed in the post-Ben Ali era.' RSF expressed their concern with the fact that Tunisian journalists may face a prison sentence for a newspaper article, stating that the threat of imprisonment sends an extremely disturbing signal to all those who defend freedom of expression. 'This is a hypocritical reaction because photos of this kind often appear on the cover of foreign magazines sold in Tunisia,' RSF said.","Photo showed footballer Sami Khedira and his model girlfriend Lena Gercke .

"By . Richard Shears . Last updated at 4:24 PM on 24th February 2012 . Australia's British-born Prime Minister Julia Gillard faces a shootout against her former foreign minister Kevin Rudd after he challenged her leadership. But Miss Gillard is convinced she has the support of the Labour Party to see off Mr Rudd - the man she ousted for the top job in 2010. Mr Rudd resigned as Foreign Minister on Tuesday while he was in Washington, raising speculation that he would challenge Miss Gillard when her cabinet meets on Monday. Scroll down for video . Confident: Australia's Prime Minister Julia Gillard said she will hold a ballot for the Labour Party leadership on Monday . Kevin Rudd confirmed today he will challenge Julia Gillard for the Labor leadership on Monday . A recent poll shows Mr Rudd is preferred as prime minister by 57 per cent of voters compared with 35 per cent for Ms Gillard. In October, Mr Rudd led by 61 per cent to 30 per cent. About one-quarter of those who back Mr Rudd do not believe he should run for the leadership. Source: Herald/Nielsen poll . Mr Rudd then declined to confirm whether he will take on 50-year-old Miss Gillard, before confirming he will today. He said: 'And starting on Monday, I want to start restoring that trust. That’s why I've decided to contest the leadership of the Australian Labor Party. 'I want to finish the job the Australian people elected me to do when I was elected by them to become prime minister.' The PM had said she will hold a ballot . for the Labour Party leadership on Monday in any case to end all the . speculation over who is the best person to hold the the top job - a . debate that has been damaging the party according to opinion polls. Miss Gillard, who arrived in Australia . with her parents from Barry, in Wales, when she was five, said yesterday: . 'Australians are rightly sick of this. We need a leadership ballot to . settle this question once and for all.' She added that she expected Mr Rudd . would be a candidate in the ballot - but was confident that not only . would she win it, but would go on to win the next general election due . next year. Refusal: Julia Gillard ousted Kevin Rudd as prime minister in June 2010 and there has been ongoing tension in the Labor Party in recent weeks over the leadership . Announcement: Mr Rudd declared his resignation at a press conference in Washington DC, saying he could not continue without Ms Gillard's support . She said: 'I am confident that...we . can win that election provided we use Monday's opportunity to end this . for all time and then we get on with the job of delivering good . government for the Australian people. Mr Rudd, 54, has been a thorn in Miss . Gillard's side since she gathered enough support to oust him from the . Prime Minister's job two years ago as he slumped in the opinion polls . against the Liberal - Australia's conservative - Party. As Miss Gillard's popularity also . began to slide in the opinion polls, Mr Rudd is understood to have . indicated to people close to him that he would try to get his old job . back. Miss Gillard appointed him as her . Foreign Minister when she took over, but it was in Washington at a snap . news conference that he announced his resignation from the position. Unhappy union: Recent polls suggest their ongoing battle has been damaging the Labour Party . Before leaving Washington, where he . had met US Secretary of State Hilary Clinton, Mr Rudd told reporters . that some of his colleagues had told him that they regarded him 'as the . best prospect to lead the Australian Labour Party successfully to the . next elections'. Despite Miss Gillard's conviction that . she has the support to thwart any leadership challenge by Mr Rudd, . former Attorney-General Robert McClelland stepped forward today to . declare his support for Mr Rudd. He said: 'He's our best prospect to win the next federal election.' But Labour Senator Mark Arbib used virtually the same words to lend his support to Miss Gillard, saying she was 'the best person to lead the country and win the next federal election for Labour'.","Miss Gillard to hold ballot for the Labour Party leadership in a cabinet meeting on Monday .

"By . Ian Sparks . Last updated at 5:29 PM on 24th February 2012 . A glamorous French politician is set to become France’s first ever ‘MP for Britain’ to represent more than 100,000 Gallic expats living in the UK. Emmanuelle Savarit, 39, is leading the race to be elected to France’s newest overseas constituency - based in London’s well-heeled Kensington. The member of Nicolas Sarkozy’s conservative UMP party is the clear frontrunner among five hopefuls vying for the seat of northern Europe. Hopeful: Emmanuelle Savarit, 39, is leading the race to be elected to France's newest overseas constituency - based in London's well-heeled Kensington . The radical plans to create 11 foreign constituencies to represent French abroad were approved by the Paris parliament three years ago. Britain is part of the northern Europe constituency, which also includes the Irish Republic, Scandinavia and the Baltic states. But within the new seat, 113,655 French voters are registered in the UK, compared with 27,076 in all the other countries put together. Divorced mother-of-two Ms Savarit’s main rival is equally glamorous 36-year-old socialist Axelle Lemaire, a London-based lawyer. Competition: Divorced mother-of-two Ms Savarit's main rival is 36-year-old socialist Axelle Lemaire, a London-based lawyer . But the French media predict the right-winger’s victory will be ensured by wealthy expats based mainly in west London when the first election takes place in June. Ms Savarit, who has a doctorate in Psychology, describes herselfon her campaign website as ‘a tough cookie’, but adds: 'That’s not necessarily a fault when you’re in politics.' The new foreign constituencies are the brainchild of former French interior affairs minister Alain Marlaix. Vital: The importance of the French expat vote was highlighted when President Sarkozy came to London to give a speech to thousands of French voters ahead of his 2007 election campaign . He said: 'This is the first time in any country in the world that something like this had been done. 'The new overseas MPs will have identical status to any other MP based in France, and vote in parliament in Paris. 'They will be elected in the same way and speak for the French expatriates they represent.' Government advisor Herve Fabre-Aubrespy, who is overseeing the new constituencies, said: 'It is a challenge for us, because nothing similar has ever been done anywhere. 'No one has carved the world up into constituencies in this way.' The new constituencies are part of a larger parliamentary shake-up, with seats being merged or enlarged across France so that the total number of 577 MPs still remains the same. The importance of the French expat vote was highlighted when President Sarkozy came to London to give a speech to thousands of French voters ahead of his 2007 election campaign. But French socialists have claimed the new overseas seats are ‘closet gerrymandering’ - where constituencies are created to the benefit of the ruling party. A socialists’ spokesman said: 'Studies show French people living abroad are more likely to vote for a centre-right party than a left wing one.'This is being proposed as something that is good for French expatriates, but in fact it is just a way for the government to give itself another 11 safe seats.' Six of the 11 new constituencies will be in Europe, but others are based in Canada and the US, central and South America, the Middle East, Arica and Asia, representing more than million French people living abroad.","Nominated person will represent more than 100,000 Gallic expats living in the UK ."
"By . Paul Milligan and Lee Moran . Last updated at 4:07 PM on 24th February 2012 . The father of a British photographer wounded in the blast that killed Sunday Times photographer Marie Colvin has said his son 'doesn't want to leave her body behind'. Paul Conroy, who suffered shrapnel injuries to a leg in a mortar attack, today appeared in a YouTube video saying he is 'absolutely OK' and being looked after by rebel fighters. But despite appeals from two French journalists to be airlifted  immediately out of the country, his father Les has revealed his son is 'insisting he doesn't want to be moved out unless all of them can be taken out'. He told the Liverpool ECHO: 'He doesn't want to leave Marie's body behind.' Scroll down for video . Loyalty: Sunday Times photographer Paul Conroy (left) is believed to be insisting that he will not leave Syria without the body of his colleague Marie Colvin (right) who was killed on Wednesday . Desperate: Edith Bouvier appeals on YouTube to French authorities to get her out of Syria so she can receive medical attention . Speaking on the video from a makeshift hospital bed, Devon-based father-of-three Paul, 47, who is believed to have been on assignment alongside Colvin, is seen asking British government agencies for assistance. Appeal: Bouvier's colleague William Daniels also appears on her video . Paul, who grew up in Liverpool, tells the camera: 'I’m being looked after by the Free Syrian Army medical staff, who are treating me with the best medical treatment available.' His video clip followed the pleas of two French journalists who are asking to be airlifted from Syria as quickly as possible. French journalist Edith Bouvier's leg was badly broken in Wednesdays attack, which also killed photographer Remi Ochlik. Le Figaro writer Ms Bouvier posted a video, alongside colleague William Daniels, asking for a temporary ceasefire so she can be taken out to receive treatment. She said: 'I need to undergo surgery as soon as possible. The doctors have treated us very well here, and have done the best they could, but they are unable to perform surgery.' The pleas came as government troops continued to shell rebel-held areas in central Syria today, killing at least five people. They died in renewed shelling of the Baba Amr neighbourhood of Homs, the latest of hundreds killed there in recent weeks. The neighbourhood, under siege and intense shelling for three weeks, has become the centre of the revolt.

Military: Rebel fighters pictured in the city of Homs, which continues to be subjected to rocket attacks .

Amateur . videos posted on the internet by activists showed black smoke rising . from residential areas of Baba Amr and debris littering its slum-like . apartment blocks. The British-based Observatory for Human Rights said troops were also attempting to storm Rastan, a besieged rebel-held town just north of Homs. Britain is to recognise the Syrian opposition as a 'legitimate representative' of the country's people, William Hague said today. The Foreign Secretary made the comment as he arrived in Tunisia for talks on the response to brutal repression by Syrian president Bashar Assad's regime. He said the international community had to 'tighten the diplomatic and economic stranglehold' on the Syrian government, amid growing concern over bloodshed in Homs and other cities. He said: 'We will intensify our links with the opposition. I will meet leaders of the Syrian National Council in a few minutes' time, before the main meeting takes place. 'We, in common with other nations, will now treat them and recognise them as a legitimate representative of the Syrian people.' Mr Hague denounced Assad's government as 'a criminal regime'. But he indicated that Britain is not contemplating sending arms to the Syrian opposition, as some people have demanded. It said the town was being shelled and reported heavy clashes between troops and army defectors who destroyed two armoured personnel carriers. The renewed violence comes as the United States, Europe and Arab nations meet in Tunisia to seek ways to ease the crisis. More than 70 countries will participate in today's Friends of Syria meeting, which is expected to press Assad to agree to a ceasefire and allow humanitarian aid to reach the areas that have been hardest-hit by his security forces. In the run up to the conference, American, European and Arab officials said the group would be likely to impose harsher sanctions if Assad rejects the ceasefire and predicted that his opponents would grow stronger if he remained in power. Before the meeting, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton suggested Syria's opposition will ultimately arm itself and said she would bet against Assad staying in power. She said: 'The strategy followed by the Syrians and their allies is one that can't stand the test of legitimacy or even brutality for any length of time. 'There will be increasingly capable opposition forces. They will from somewhere, somehow, find the means to defend themselves as well as begin offensive measures. 'It is clear to me there will be a breaking point. I wish it would be sooner, so that more lives would be saved, than later, but I have absolutely no doubt there will be such a breaking point.' And in an effort to bring an end to the violence, the United Nations announced that former Secretary General Kofi Annan will be the joint UN-Arab League envoy to deal with the crisis.

Protest: Women cry over the body of a victim (left) as others march against Assad's regime (right) Fighting violence with violence: Free Syrian Army rebels pose in front of a tank taken by defectors from the regular Syrian Army . Syrian forces have shot dead unarmed women and children, shelled residential areas and tortured wounded protesters in hospital under orders from the 'highest level' of army and government officials, the United Nations said yesterday. Independent UN investigators called for perpetrators of such crimes against humanity to face prosecution and said they had drawn up a confidential list of names of commanding officers and officials alleged to be responsible. The commission of inquiry, headed by Brazilian Paulo Pinheiro, found rebel forces led by the Free Syrian Army had also committed abuses including killings and abductions, 'although not comparable in scale'. The report, which also said Syria is 'on the brink' of civil war, said: 'Army snipers and Shabbiha gunmen posted at strategic points terrorised the population, targeting and killing small children, women and other unarmed civilians.' In a statement, Annan said he would try to 'help bring an end to the violence and human rights abuses, and promote a peaceful solution' in Syria. He expressed hope the Syrian government and opposition groups will co-operate with him in his efforts. The Tunisia meeting is the latest international effort to end the crisis, which began when protesters, inspired by the Arab Spring uprisings elsewhere, took to the streets in some of Syria's  impoverished provinces nearly a year ago to call for political change. Since then, Assad's security forces have violently repressed the uprising, blaming it on Islamic extremists and armed gangs, while members of the originally peaceful opposition have taken up arms. The UN estimated in January that 5,400 people had been killed in the conflict last year. Hundreds more have died since. Syrian activists say the death toll is now more than 7,300. Overall figures cannot be independently confirmed because Syria has prevented most media from operating inside the country.

Smuggler: A man pictured transporting essential goods over the border with Turkey . Also today, UN-appointed investigators in Geneva said they had compiled a list of Syrian officials accused of crimes against humanity in the crackdown. The list, it said, reaches as high as Assad. Russia and China have long opposed foreign intervention in Syria. Alexei Pushkov, a Russian lawmaker, said today after meeting Assad recently that the Syrian president sounded confident and demonstrated no sign he would step aside. And Pushkov warned that arming the Syrian opposition would fuel civil war. 'Assad doesn't look like a person ready to leave, because, among other things, there is no reason for him to do that as he is being supported by broad layers of the population,' Pushkov said, according to the RIA-Novosti news agency.

A teacher has denied she had a six-month sexual relationship with a 14-year-old student which started through social networking. Math . teacher Marie Johnson, 41, from Livermore, California, was arrested and . booked on 24 counts of sexual assault charges last month. Authorities . believe a sexual relationship started in December 2010 until May 2011, with . most incidents taking place in the teacher's car. Arrested: Marie Johnson, 41, has been accused of having sexual relations with a student over a six-month period - but she has denied the claims . The boy is said to be a former student of Johnson's, who has been a math teacher for 13 years, at Granada High School. She was charged with unlawful sexual intercourse with a person under 18, oral copulation and committing a lewd act on a child. But she entered a not guilty plea on Thursday in Alameda County Superior Court in Pleasanton. According to the San Francisco . Chronicle, the relationship between Johnson and the boy started through . text messages, Facebook and instant messaging through the smart phone . game, Words with Friends. Scene: The teen was at Granada High School when the alleged sexual assaults took place. He told his coach he was a victim of 'repeated molestation' On January 10, the boy told a coach at his school that 'he was a victim of repeated molestation,' police Detective Joseph Draghi wrote in a statement. The boy, who is now 15, 'provided a detailed statement of a long-term sexual relationship with Johnson,' Draghi wrote. Police are advising parents to talk to their children about the episode. Police officer Steve Goard said: 'We don't think that there are other victims, but we're not ruling that out, being that she's a teacher and has had access to kids throughout the years.' Wooing: The relationship was initially formed via text messages, Facebook and through instant messaging on the smartphone app Words with Friends . Livermore Valley Joint Unified School District Superintendent Kelly Bowers said Johnson was placed on administrative leave . She said: 'As always, while following due process guidelines, if we discover that any adult or staff member has placed a student at risk, we take appropriate, swift and decisive action.

A new robot from Japan is a metal 'avatar' that is controlled via a virtual reality suit - letting users remote-control the robot and see through its eyes. The Telesar V mimics the movements of its pilot - and is so realistic it can even pick up objects. Scientists hope similar robots could venture into dangerous areas such as contaminated reactors. The controller dons a 3D head display that covers his whole vision and can 'see' through a robot's eyes. Wheenever he moves sensors replicate that movement on the robot. Scroll down for video . Groundbreaking: The Telesar V could bring human skills to areas that are too dangerous for people . 'Pilots' of the robot can 'see' what the robot sees through its video camera eyes and 'feel' what it feels through its metal hands via sensors in their control suit's gloves . The robot mirrors the movement of the person wearing its 'control suit' - with movements so precise it can even pick up objects . The Telesar’s temperature sensors are so precise they tell how hot something is when the robot touches it. It can also feel the shape of something as small as a lego brick - with corresponding impulses being sent back to the controller. The robot’s makers believe it could be extremely useful in situation like the Fukushima disaster when radiation levels are too deadly for humans and the current wheeled robots are not responsive enough. It could also have applications for bomb disposal, space exploration or for surgery., . The Telesar V has been developed by Japanese researchers at Keio University and has been made as life-like as possible. It has eight joints on its neck and seven on its arms, like like humans do. Pressure simulators within the control suit's gloves allow the 'driver' to feel what the robot is touching . The pilot simply moves their arms fingers and head to pilot Telesar V . The screen on the top right shows what the 'pilot' is seeing through her VR helmet - the same pink teddy that is directly in front of the robot, bottom right . The body can also move in seven different directions and it has video cameras in its head that are linked up to the 3D head display so the user can ‘see’ what it is looking at. Sensory data is sent back via gloves fitted with semiconductors and motors which mimic touch, pressure, texture, heat and cold. Mashahiro Furukawa of the Telesar team said the aim was to ‘make it really feel as if you are in another place’. He said: ‘What you can do with this telexistence robot is you can see things you normally see, even in a remote location. ‘If you are a physician, for example, to examine a patient you need to extend your hands. ‘With this system you have hands that you can move just like your own. ‘You can also hear what’s going on around you. Those are the first things that we achieved with this system. ‘Now we have added sensors that communicate what the robot’s fingers are touching and a system to feed the touch sensation back to the operator. ‘The technology makes it possible to operate the robot as your avatar and feel what you are touching, even if you are a long distance away.’ Pofessor Susumu Tachi of Keio university’s graduate school of media and design added that the research could allow humans to go into areas that are too dangerous for them but ‘require human skills’.","Suit lets 'pilot' see through robot eyes and feel with its hands .

"By . David Baker . Last updated at 4:57 PM on 23rd February 2012 . 'All I wanted was an easy life': Robert Moffat said he wished he had never won the lottery after he avoided prison for drink driving at a court hearing in Falkirk today . A lottery winner who blew all his money said today he wished he had never won the prize as he revealed he was now too poor even to pay a court fine for drink-driving. Robert Moffat - one of Scotland's first big winners - escaped a jail term after being caught more than five times the legal limit behind the wheel of his father's car. Moffat scooped £800,000 in 1996 - his share of a bumper £3.5million win divided among family members - but Falkirk Sheriff Court heard he now lives on benefits and can't afford to pay any financial penalty. After being ordered to carry out 200 hours unpaid work, and being banned from the road for five years, Moffat said he wished he had never won the money. The former barman, 51, said outside court: 'I had a much easier life before this happened. It was much less stressful. 'I just had a normal life, and had worked in the pub trade for over 19 years, just working away. 'After my win, everyone was chasing me for money, even the banks. There was obviously the high-profile paternity test as well. 'If I could go back to my life I would. I wish I'd never won this to be honest. All I wanted was an easy life.' When asked what he had spent the money on, he said: 'Houses, cars, holidays and diamonds. Frittered away: Lottery winner Robery Moffat pictured here with his TR6 car which he was asked to sell to pay for legal aid after spending his £800,000 win . 'I lived a good life for a while but £800,000 isn't a great deal when you spread it over 10 or so years. 'I just whittled it away, bit by bit. I had a pub in Denny, but I lost it two years ago, and have been unemployed since. 'It's been really difficult. All I really want is just a job. Any job really. I just want to get working again.' He said there was no in-fighting with the family members with who  he shared the winnings -his father Tom, his brother Jim, 56, and sister Anne, 59. He added: 'We don't discuss the money much. I don't know how much the rest of them still have. Fall from grace: Moffat poses with his wife, Michelle, by his house and luxury Range Rover. He has since lost all three and is now living off benefits . 'We keep ourselves to ourselves, but we get on when we see each other.' The former barman, who was happily married before the win, with a daughter, had surrounded himself with the trappings of wealth - a Range Rover stood in the driveway of his luxury bungalow while a lovingly-restored classic Triumph sports car gleamed in the garage. Both had personal registration plates. However, the court heard he had lost it all, including his wife, Michelle. Mark Keane, prosecuting, said that a member of the public phoned the police at 5pm on December 30 last year, after seeing a car which had crashed into a pavement bollard at Northfield Rd, Denny. The driver was confirmed as Moffat - at the wheel of his father's X-type Jaguar. Mr Keane said: 'As he approached the locus, he lost control, striking a bollard on the pavement. As a result, the front of the car was damaged. Happier times: Robert Moffat, and his former wife Michelle and their daughter Danielle on holiday at Disney, before he lost his lottery win and turned to benefits . 'The member of the public saw the car with the engine still running. The sole occupant of the car got out and walked off up the road.' He added: 'The witness was of the opinion that the driver was under the influence of alcohol and he reported the matter to police.' Moffat was traced and taken to a police station where he admitted it was his father's car and apologised. Moffat, of Braes View, Denny, Stirlingshire, admitted driving with an alcohol count of 186 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath. The limit is 35. His pleas of not guilty to two further charges - failing to give information to the police as to who was the driver, and failing to cooperate with a preliminary breath test - were accepted by the Crown. Ban: Robert Moffat arrives at Falkirk Sheriff Court where he was banned from driving for five years and ordered to carry out 200 hours unpaid work . Defence solicitor Dick Sandeman said: 'Mr Moffat has had a particularly hard time over the past year or so. 'He lost everything he had in his business and his wife and he split up. 'He has a drink difficulty.' Sheriff Thomas McCartney said only Moffat's lack of recent offending made him decide against a jail term. He said: 'That someone should drive a car with such a high level of alcohol is absolutely outrageous.' After Moffat won the Lottery a  former girlfriend claimed that he was the father of her son from a short-lived affair. He found himself in court defending a bitter paternity action, but the case was thrown out when DNA tests proved Moffat could not be the boy's father. Speaking at the time Moffat said: 'It's not pleasant being in the papers all the time just because people are jealous of my money and my nice cars.' Mr Moffat Snr also had post lottery problems. He married Emily Mitchell, who was 24 years his junior, and the pair ended up in the divorce courts after it was claimed he could not afford a £90,000 settlement because he had given away so much of his winnings to family, charity - and spent a lot on her during the marriage. The retired metal worker, whose first wife died in 1989, and Emily eventually came to an amicable agreement.","Robert Moffat escapes jail term after being caught FIVE times over the limit .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 10:44 PM on 26th February 2012 . A U.S. politician has resigned after it was revealed he had sent suggestive and harassing text messages to a married female . lawyer, who he called a ‘sexxxy mama’. Richard Steinberg, 39, . a Florida House Representative, sent dozens of messages last autumn to Assistant U.S. Attorney Marlene . Fernandez-Karavetsos, 37. Mr Steinberg, a married father of a young daughter, has known Mrs Fernandez-Karavetsos professionally for 15 years but did not mention who the creepy messages were from. Married man: Rep. Richard Steinberg , pictured with his wife Micky in 2008, resigned from the House after it was revealed he had been sending creepy text messages to Assistant U.S. Attorney Marlene Fernandez-Karavetsos in Florida . He resigned from his post on Friday after returning to Florida from Washington when news of the story broke in the Miami Herald. He asked for privacy while he deals with his personal affairs. 'The events of the past week have been difficult for my family, for me and for everyone involved,' Steinberg said in a written statement. 'As I did earlier this week, I want to once again, very directly and sincerely, apologize to everyone I have hurt.' Mr Steinberg had earlier said sorry for ‘sending inappropriate and . unsolicited messages’ and said he ‘regrets’ disrespecting the woman, her . husband and his constituents. Steinberg, a Democratic state . representative since 2008, admitted sending unsolicited texts to Mrs . Fernandez-Karavetsos, an assistant U.S. attorney in Miami. Prosecutor: Marlene Fernandez-Karavetsos, left, works in general litigation for the U.S. Attorney in Miami and is married to George Karavetsos, 39 . Federal . authorities were investigating the messages as a possible stalking . case, an offense that carries a maximum one-year jail sentence. Rep. Perry Thurston said: 'We're . all concerned about him. We care about him but I think that his family . comes first and he made a decision based on his family and the fact that . he wanted to just bring all the speculation to an end. I want to once again, very directly and sincerely, apologize to everyone I have hurt. 'He was one of our best members. He was one who was committed to the process and everyone in the caucus loved and loves him.' Mrs Fernandez-Karavetsos is married . to George Karavetsos, also a federal prosecutor and chief of the Miami . U.S. attorney's narcotics section . In . a meeting with investigators, the attorney said she knew Steinberg 'in a . professional non-intimate way' and provided screen shots of the . numerous messages on her phone. According to the warrant filed in . Miami-Dade County Circuit Court, investigators traced dozens of text . messages sent under the user name 'itsjustme24680' to the politician's . home in Miami Beach. Sinister: Steinberg sent the messages from a phone that disguised the number but this was traced to his internet account . The number associated with that identity was a 'spoof,' according to investigators, meaning the true phone number was hidden on the victim's phone. The search warrant details some of the texts, which began in August, and show that Mrs Fernandez-Karavetsos tried numerous times to get the sender to stop. 'Sexxxy mama?' read one text. 'How do I know you?' Mrs Fernandez-Karavetsos responded. Later itsjustme wrote: 'Good morning!' 'Leave me alone' the prosecutor responded. 'Is that any way to treat a friend? LOL' came the response. Then Mrs Fernandez-Karavetsos wrote: 'This is the last time I'm going to ask, you've been texting long enough- who is this?' 'Considering we're both married parents, probably best I not answer that at this point,' he wrote in reply. Mrs Fernandez-Karavetsos, her husband and the U.S. Attorney's Office declined to comment on the resignation. Rep Scott Plakon said Steinberg did the right thing by resigning. He said: 'We do a lot of important things up here, but I'm glad he's going to attend to his family because that's more important than a lot of other stuff. 'I wish him the best.'","Representative Richard Steinberg asked for 'privacy at difficult time'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 6:16 AM on 26th February 2012 . Officials seeking to prosecute a nine-year-old boy who is accused of accidentally shooting a classmate have said they do not want the child to go to jail. 'Nobody is trying to lock this little boy up,' said Washington state prosecutor Russ Hauge. He said prosecutors hope to hold the boy accountable not through incarceration, but rather probation, treatment and other services. Scroll down for video . Consequences: A boy appeared in court, supported by his uncle and father, facing charges of shooting a classmate with a handgun he had brought in his backpack to their Washington school . The third-grader faces charges of unlawful possession of a gun, bringing a dangerous weapon to school and third-degree assault. He is facing a capacity hearing in . which a judge will determine if he knew what he did was wrong. If the . judge decides the boy knew, the charges go forward. An eight-year-old classmate - Amina . Kocer-Bowman - was wounded. She is in a Seattle hospital in critical . condition after undergoing surgeries. Few additional details of the case . have been released, though the investigation may include a look at how . the boy got the .45-calibre pistol that went off in his backpack. Mr Hauge said his office is working with the investigative agencies involved in the shooting. Victim: Amina Kocer-Bowman was accidentally shot in the abdomen when the gun that was inside another student's backpack went off and hit her . Police believe the boy got the gun during a weekend visit with his mother, Jamie Lee Chaffin. According to court documents, Ms . Chaffin has been convicted of forgery and drug crimes. As a felon, her . right to own a firearm was revoked. She completed court-ordered drug treatment, and no additional criminal charges were filed against her after 2007. The boy's father, Jason Cochran, has . been convicted of violating protection orders relating to Ms Chaffin and . has been taken to court for child support. Both parents relinquished custody of the boy and his two sisters to his paternal grandmother. She died shortly after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2010, and the boy's uncle Patrick Cochran was granted custody. Horror: Kiomi Pavlock, 12, hugs her dad James as a friend shows her anguish over the incident. The school went into lockdown on Wednesday . Distraught: Savannah Anderson, 13, hugs her little sister Kaylee, 10, after arriving in the school's gymnasium to take her home after the shooting . The boy's family bailed him out of . juvenile detention and took him to his uncle's home on Thursday night. Bail had been set at $50,000. The boy will remain under house arrest and must check in daily with the county juvenile department. Shaking in his orange jumpsuit, the boy wept as he faced his first court hearing after the incident. As court officers led the boy away after the hearing, his father hugged him and gave him a kiss while they both cried. The boy's father, Mr Cochran, said . outside the courthouse: 'I just want everyone to know that my kid made a . mistake. It was a terrible mistake.' 'He's a good kid. It's all I can say,' said his uncle. 'I apologise to the family of that girl. I really do.' He added: 'I just want him back home.' Probe: The third-grade boy who allegedly brought the gun into school is being held at a juvenile detention centre on suspicion of illegally possessing a firearm and third-degree assault . Emergency: A police officer stands watch by the entrance to Armin Jahr Elementary School in Washington, where eight-year-old Amina Kocer-Bowman was shot when a gun discharged inside a boy's backpack . Court documents stated that the boy . told a classmate five days ago that he was going to bring his 'dad's . gun' to school and run away. The gun discharged after the boy slammed his backpack down on a desk, it was reported. Dr Eileen Bulger said the girl will likely be in hospital for several weeks and face further surgeries. She was sedated and on a ventilator but has woken up and interacted with her parents. Her father, John Bowman, thanked his . daughter's teacher. He said: 'Had she not administered first aid and . stopped the bleeding from the gunshot wound, this event would have . surely been tragic.' Lori Morsette, a friend of the . victim's family, said: 'She is a sweet little girl and I don't know what . to do. I'm trying to be supportive for my friends, I'm trying to be . there for them.' The school is in a quiet residential neighborhood about 20 miles west of Seattle, across Puget Sound.","Boy was 'trying to run away' when he took gun to school in Washington .

"By . Laura Clark . Last updated at 10:30 AM on 24th February 2012 . Can't speak, won't speak? Training is being given to school leavers who use 'IDK' and 'LOL' Bosses are having to send young recruits on courses to ‘de-text’ their speech because they can no longer hold a proper conversation. Training is being given to school leavers who use text-speak such as ‘IDK’ for ‘I don’t know’ and ‘LOL’ for ‘laughing out loud’. Peter Searle, UK chief executive of the recruitment company Adecco, said growing numbers of firms have been forced into action to rectify the problem. He also warned that social networking websites have created a generation of employees who lack the basic skills needed to succeed in the workplace. Heavy use of Twitter and Facebook is isolating staff because relationships are all through a machine, he said. ‘We have instances in offices where people would rather sit at their desk and send e-mails to each other next door than walk around and have a conversation. ‘They have no respect for their manager. They don’t ask them for advice because it isn’t their social background to do that.’ ‘All the things that we think of as normal, they aren’t prepared for.’ Employers are struggling to fill vacancies because some school-leavers are unable to work in a team, turn up on time or communicate with colleagues, said Mr Searle. This includes talking in text message language. ‘They only know to interact with short “text speak” to save themselves time, so they start using text speak in conversations,’ he said. ‘They come out of school and want to get a job, but the people who are interviewing them are saying their personal social skills and technical abilities are not suited to the way things work in industry.' Research for Adecco found that 52 per . cent of employers believe the British school system is failing to equip . youngsters for the world of work. Virtually unsound: Social networking websites have created a generation of employees who lack the basic skills needed to succeed in the workplace . Recommendations include an ‘employment experience’ programme to be developed to give pupils a taste of what to expect in their working life. ‘We have a generation of people who are fundamentally bored and who need something to motivate them,’ said Mr Searle. The recession had highlighted the gap between what the education system provides and what businesses want, he added. ‘There are no large environments where you can just hang up your brain as you go inside and go through the day and get paid for it. Our education system is failing to equip the future workforce effectively. ‘As a nation, we place insufficient value on the basic tools of employability such as behaviour, attitude and communication – in the classroom, the workplace and in the home. 'As a result, we fear a whole generation of potential workers will be deemed unemployable and lost to UK businesses.’ Mr Searle’s warning reinforces evidence from exam boards that teenagers are using text short-hand in written papers, including ‘C’ for ‘see’ and ‘U’ for ‘you’. GCSE courses starting in September will award marks for correct spelling, punctuation and grammar. A new curriculum is expected to place greater emphasis on developing speech.","Training being given to school leavers who use text speak such as 'IDK' and 'LOL'

The nurse who was allegedly kicked in the crotch by Bobby Kennedy's son has spoken out about what she described as an 'assault' at the hospital where she works. Cari Luciano, who is 5ft tall, told her husband, 'I was assaulted tonight and could you believe it, it was a Kennedy who did it?' Douglas Kennedy, a journalist, was arrested for allegedly attacking two nurses who tried to stop him removing his newborn baby from hospital. Charges: Douglas Kennedy, pictured with his wife Molly and their son Boru, was arrested this week over an alleged incident which occurred following the birth of the baby . Hospital: Mr Kennedy is shown in security footage trying to take his newborn son for a walk . He is charged with harassment and endangering the welfare of a child following the altercation, which happened last month. A spokesman for the family said they . hoped to have 'a full picture of the events that occurred that night' in . order to prove Mr Kennedy's innocence. Ms Luciano's husband told the Daily . News the nurse was simply trying to ensure that Mr Kennedy followed . hospital rules when he wanted to take his two-day-old son Boru for a . walk. Steve Luciano rubbished the idea that . his wife could have been an aggressor, saying: 'Cari is probably 5ft . tall on her best day.' 'Attack': A figure shown falling over in the corridor is said to be a nurse kicked in the crotch by Mr Kennedy . Fall: Mr Kennedy is also said to have twisted the arm of a nurse who tried to block his way . He also suggested that Mr Kennedy's . family background influenced his decision to remove a GPS tracker from . his son and take the baby for a walk. 'My understanding is that Mr Kennedy . took it off and said something like, ""My son needs to get fresh air,""' said Mr Luciano. 'From my perspective, the doctor assumed that between . your name and my status, what rules apply?' Mr Kennedy strongly refutes the charges, and told NBC New York the claims were 'absurd'. The accusations date from January 7, . when Mr Kennedy, 44, was visiting his wife Molly and their newborn son - . the couple's fourth - in Northern Westchester Hospital in New York. Mr and Mrs Kennedy then started to take the baby for a walk outside, but were stopped by nurses concerned for the boy's safety. They asked him to return the newborn . to the emergency room, but he refused - encouraged by Dr Timothy . Haydock, a family friend who works at the hospital. When Mr Kennedy ignored them and . walked in to the elevator, nurses triggered a 'code pink', which alerts . staff that someone is trying to abduct a baby. Accused: Mr Kennedy has been charged with harassment and endangerment of a child . Scene: The altercation happened at the Northern Westchester Hospital in suburban New York on January 7 . Police said that one nurse, Anna . Margaret Lane, stood in Mr Kennedy's way, so he grabbed her wrist and . twisted it to move her out of the way.

"By . Associated Press . Last updated at 6:41 PM on 25th February 2012 . Tragic life: Savannah Hardin, 9, lived a life of fear and was plagued with a medical condition that forced her to see a urologist every six months . Savannah Hardin's life was in turmoil long before police say the nine-year-old was run to death by her grandmother and stepmother for allegedly lying about some candy she ate. Divorce and custody documents filed in family court over a period of several years reflect a history of fractured family relationships, with Savannah's divorced parents fighting over her welfare; claims of mental instability and abuse between her father and his second wife. She also suffered medical problems that required frequent doctor visits; and counselling for the girl who still somehow managed to remain among the top students in her third-grade class. Authorities say Savannah's life ended in exhaustion earlier this month when she was forced by her paternal grandmother, Joyce Hardin Gerrard, to run for three hours, while her stepmother, Jessica Mae Hardin, did nothing to stop it. The grandmother prodded her along cruelly, and the stepmother didn't intervene until Savannah collapsed in an unconscious heap, investigators say. Now, Hardin Garrard is in jail and Savannah's stepmother is being held in police custody at a hospital after giving birth to another child. Both have been charged with murder. Jessica Mae Hardin's attorneys, Morgan Cunningham and Vince Pentecost, said in a statement Friday that Hardin was 'incredibly devastated over Savannah's death' and they would prove her innocence. 'Unfortunately, whenever a child passes away, our society wants to place blame, our media wants to sensationalize and our elected officials want to make grandiose statements that are not based in fact,' they said. A defence lawyer representing the grandmother said she will be cleared of any crime.'Even then, Joyce Garrard and her family will continue to grieve over the loss of their beloved Savannah,' Dani Bone said. Cruelty: Grandmother Joyce Hardin Garrard (right) and stepmother Jessica Mae Hardin (left) have been charged with the murder of Savannah Hardin, nine . Neighbours and classmates created a small memorial for Savannah, depositing stuffed animals and flowers and attaching balloons to a wooden fence surrounding the trailer where she lived with her family off a dirt road. Included in the informal memorial was a white wooden cross hung with a blue ribbon and to which a poem had been attached. A neighbour of Savannah's family, Gail Denny, held back tears as she placed a candle and a stuffed animal at the site Wednesday. She noted that on Valentine's Day, her grandson had asked Savannah to be his girlfriend, and she said yes. 'I just can't believe it,' she said of Savannah's death. A few miles away at Carlisle Elementary School, students placed written letters and hand-drawn pictures on Savannah's desk, which was brought into a main hallway. 'Savannah was an excellent student, earning A's and B's in her school work,' said a statement released by school Principal Linda Johnson. 'Her favourite subject was math; she enjoyed reading books to earn points in the Accelerated Reader program - and was very proud of always meeting her reading goals. ‘Savannah was a happy child at school. She always wore a smile, and often brightened the day of teachers and administrators with her kind comments.' Concerns: Neighbours called the sheriff's office after witnessing what was happening to nine-year-old Savannah in the rural Carlisle community . Many who knew Savannah described her as normal and happy. She played and laughed with other kids at the bus stop, and sometimes rode a four-wheeler with her dad when he visited, they said. She loved horses and her favourite colours were lime green, hot pink and ocean blue, Johnson said in her statement. Court documents filed by Savannah's father, Robert Hardin, last May show she attended counselling sessions every other week but seemed well adjusted. But the records also tell a different story, that of a brief life rocked by tumult. Robert and Savannah's biological mother, Heather Hardin, divorced in July 2006 when she was 3, the records show. The former couple shared custody of the girl, but the mother was her primary caregiver. Each one of the parents later moved separately to Florida, according to a sworn statement by Robert Hardin. He claimed that Heather Hardin was unfit to care for Savannah. The Florida Department of Children and Families investigated allegations that Savannah was being mistreated or was living in hazardous conditions at least four times between 2007 and 2009 while living with Heather Hardin in Plant City, Florida, according to documents obtained by The Ledger in Lakeland, Florida through an open records request. But state officials were unable to find evidence to support the allegations. Robert Hardin said Savannah began living with him in October 2009. He said they moved northeast of Birmingham in January 2010. Hardin later married Jessica Mae, with whom he had a son, now 3. Mr Hardin works for the U.S. State Department and lived outside the country, so Jessica Mae and Joyce Hardin Garrard cared for both Savannah and the boy, said a spokeswoman for the Etowah County Sheriff's office, Natalie Barton. Mourning: Neighbour Gail Denny places a candle and stuffed animal outside the home of 9-year-old Savannah Hardin near Attalla, Alabama . Hardin and Jessica split in July 2010, court documents show, with him claiming she had bipolar disorder and alcoholic tendencies. She, in turn, accused him of mental and physical abuse, including pushing her against a wall and throwing her onto a sofa. She also accused him of transferring ownership of the mobile home to Hardin Gerrard to prevent Jessica from getting it in the divorce. Despite claiming they could no longer live together, the couple reconciled by late 2010. Court documents also show Savannah had an unspecified medical condition that required continuous medication and treatment, including monthly visits with her regular doctor and trips every few months to see a urologist in Birmingham, about 60 miles away. Authorities say the grandmother became angry when Savannah allegedly ate chocolate, because it contains caffeine, and the girl was not supposed to ingest caffeine given her condition. Sometime during the afternoon of February 17, Joyce Hardin Gerrard allegedly forced Savannah to begin running in the yard outside their trailer. Barton said the grandmother was running the little girl 'like a drill sergeant,' pushing her to keep running by saying things like 'Move it, move it, move it! Go, go, go!' Barton said there is some evidence that the girl also was picking up sticks and other items in the yard and placing them in a burn pile. A large pile of unburned sticks and other items could be seen Friday behind the family's mobile home. The stepmother, Jessica Mae Hardin, didn't intervene and call 911 until after the girl collapsed about three hours into her ordeal, Barton said. Savannah was taken to an area hospital and then later transferred to a hospital in Birmingham, where she was put on life support. Her father made the decision to disconnect her, and she died Monday. While court documents show the girl's biological mother, Heather Hardin, hadn't been able to see her in months, an ex-husband said the woman rushed to Alabama from Florida in time to see Savannah in the hospital before she died. Authorities said an autopsy showed the child was severely dehydrated and had an extremely low level of sodium, which is necessary for the body to prevent seizures and dehydration. With both Joyce Garrard and Jessica Hardin in police custody, state welfare officials said a relative is now caring for Savannah's younger half-brother. The same person will care for Jessica Mae Hardin's newborn, they said. Friends and strangers alike have posted scores of messages on a remembrance site set up on Facebook, with many of them saying they wished something could have been done to save Savannah's life.","Savannah Hardin, 9, was allegedly forced to run for three hours after lying about eating some chocolate .

Australian Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd resigned on Wednesday, saying he could no longer work with Prime Minister Julia Gillard, amid speculation he would mount a leadership challenge and plunging the government into a new crisis. Ms Gillard ousted Mr Rudd as prime minister in June 2010 and there has been ongoing tension in the Labor Party in recent weeks over the leadership. He made the announcement at a press conference in Washington DC, where he had earlier met US Secretary of State Hilary Clinton. Scroll down for video .

Announcement: Mr Rudd declared his resignation at a press conference in Washington DC, saying he could not continue without Ms Gillard's support . A recent poll shows Mr Rudd is preferred as prime minister by 57 per cent of voters compared with 35 per cent for Ms Gillard. In October, Mr Rudd led by 61 per cent to 30 per cent.

'The simple truth is that I cannot continue to serve as foreign minister if I don't have Prime Minister Gillard's support,' he said. 'I therefore believe the only honourable course of action is for me to resign.' He said he would not be involved in a 'stealth attack on a sitting prime minister'. 'We all know that what happened then was wrong and it must never happen again,' he said, referring to how he was ousted.

But while Rudd is more popular with voters, he is not as well liked within the Labor Party and he alienated may colleagues with imperious style when he was prime minister. Labor insiders say Gillard has the strong support of the ruling Labor Party, with Rudd supporters numbering around 30 of the 103 Labor Party lawmakers. Earlier, Gillard was reportedly considering sacking Rudd from the ministry in order to reassert her authority over the government. While Rudd would be unlikely to win a leadership vote, any surprise Rudd victory could force a snap election as he would need to re-negotiate support from the Greens and independents. Opposition leader Abbott has vowed to scrap the government's proposed taxes on carbon emissions and mining profits if he wins the next election. Senior government ministers have in the past week urged Gillard to sack Rudd from the ministry due to the bitter and ongoing speculation that he wants to return as prime minister. 'The simple truth is I cannot continue to serve as foreign minister if I do not have Prime Minister Gillard's support,' Rudd said. 'The only honourable course of action is for me to resign.' Weeks of leadership instability now undermines Labor's chances of holding power in the state of Queensland at a March 24 poll - the resource-rich state is also crucial for the national government's re-election. The Gillard government would be thrown from office if a general election was held now. Australia's next national election is due in 2013. Meanwhile gay marriage was the topic of table conversation when Prime Minister Julia Gillard, an opponent of  same sex-marriage, hosted a dinner for three gay couples at her official residence. An Australian activist group won a charity auction and the guests used the three-course meal in the national capital of Canberra to lobby the prime minister to allow gay marriage. Although Gillard’s Labor Party lifted its long-standing opposition to same-sex marriage in December, she remains against changing the law.","Kevin Rudd resigned amid speculation he would mount a leadership challenge .

"By . Kerry Mcqueeney . Last updated at 1:24 AM on 25th February 2012 . A fourth inquest has been opened into the most notorious and bitterly controversial legal drama in Australia's history: the 1980 death of a nine-week-old baby whose parents say was taken by a dingo from her tent in the Outback. Azaria Chamberlain's mother, Lindy, was convicted and later cleared of murdering her and has always maintained that a wild dog took the baby. She and her ex-husband, Michael Chamberlain, are hoping fresh evidence they have gathered about dingo attacks on children will convince Northern Territory Coroner Elizabeth Morris to end the relentless speculation that has followed them for 32 years. Determined: Azaria Chamberlain's mother, Lindy, arrived at the first day of the inquest today. She was convicted and later cleared of murdering her and has always maintained that a wild dog took the baby in 1980 . Clear their names: She went to the court with her husband Rick Creighton. Both her and her ex-husband, Michael Chamberlain (not pictured) are hoping fresh evidence will convince Northern Territory Coroner Elizabeth Morris to end the relentless 32-year speculation . Mother and daughter: The Chamberlains say they want to set the record straight on behalf of their daughter . Azaria's death certificate still lists her cause of death as unknown', which continues to fuel speculation over her parents' involvement. Anne Lade, a former police officer hired by the court to investigate the case, told a packed courtroom that in the years since Azaria disappeared, there have been numerous dingo attacks on humans, some of them fatal. Rex Wild, a lawyer assisting the coroner, described several of the attacks and said he believed the evidence showed that a dingo could have been responsible for Azaria's death. He said: 'Although it (a dingo killing a child) may have been regarded as unlikely in 1980 ... it shouldn't be by 2011-12.' The Chamberlains say they want to set the record straight on behalf of their daughter. Mrs Chamberlain said outside the courthouse in the Northern Territory capital, Darwin: 'It gives me hope this time that Australians will finally be warned and realise that dingoes are a dangerous animal. 'I also hope that this will give a final finding which closes the inquest into my daughter's death, which so far has been standing open and unfinished.' Azaria vanished from her tent in the Outback on August 17, 1980, during a family vacation to Ayers Rock, the giant red monolith now known by its Aboriginal name Uluru. Fellow campers told police they heard . a low growl followed by a baby's cry shortly before Mrs Chamberlain - . who had been making dinner at a nearby barbecue area - went to check on . her daughter. Hate figures: Lindy and her husband Michael faced intense hostility in Australia - even after the acquittal - because many people refused to believe a dingo was capable of killing a baby . Scene of tragedy: A file photo showing the camping area, including the Lindy Chamberlain's tent, where her daughter Azaria went missing, near the Uluru sandstone rock, Northern Territory, central Australia, 17 August 1980 . Mrs Chamberlain said she saw a dingo run from the tent and disappear into the darkness. There were dingo prints outside the tent, and spots of blood on the bedding inside. Upon seeing Azaria's empty bassinet, Lindy screamed, 'The dingo's got my baby!' - a line made famous by the Meryl Streep movie, A Cry in the Dark, which is based on the case. Azaria's body was never found, though her torn and bloodied jumpsuit turned up in the surrounding desert. Officials, doubtful that a dingo was strong enough to drag away a baby, charged Mrs Chamberlain with murder. Hollywood treatment: Meryl Streep (left) played Lindy Chamberlain (right) in the 1988 film A Cry In The Dark . Prosecutors said she slit Azaria's . throat in the family car - which initial forensic tests said was . splashed with baby's blood - and buried her in the desert. Mrs . Chamberlain was convicted and sentenced to life in prison. Years . later, more sophisticated tests found that the 'blood' in the car was a . combination of milk and a chemical sprayed during manufacture. Three years into Mrs Chamberlain's prison sentence, a jacket Azaria had been wearing was found by chance near a dingo den. Mrs Chamberlain was released from prison and her conviction was overturned. Still, three separate coroner's inquests have failed to agree on a cause of death for Azaria. The last inquest, held in 1995, returned an inconclusive finding, with the coroner saying there was not enough evidence to prove a dingo was responsible. Dangerous: The Chamberlains have gathered fresh evidence about dingo attacks on children which they hope will end relentless speculation that has followed them for 32 years . Since then, the Chamberlains have gathered new evidence of around a dozen dingo attacks on children, three of them fatal, said their lawyer, Stuart Tipple. That evidence has been presented to Ms Morris, the coroner, for consideration at today's inquest. Ms Morris is expected to issue her decision at a later date. In court, Michael Chamberlain fought back tears as he spoke of the nightmarish aftermath of his daughter's death. He said: 'Since the loss of Azaria I have had an abiding fear and paranoia about safety around dingoes. They send a shudder up my spine. It is a hell I have to endure.' Australians have followed the case closely since it began, and most have strong opinions. Although public support for Ms Chamberlain has grown over the years, many still doubt that a dingo could have killed Azaria.","Lindy and Michael Chamberlain present fresh evidence of dingo attacks on children .

Accusations: The 62-year-old former International Monetary Fund chief will be formally accused of attacking Nafissatou Diallo, 32, at the Times Square Sofitel in Manhattan . Civil proceedings against Dominique Strauss Kahn for a ‘sadistic and violent’ attack on a New York hotel chamber maid will heard in New York next month, it emerged today. The 62-year-old former International Monetary Fund chief will be formally accused of attacking Nafissatou Diallo, 32, at the Times Square Sofitel in Manhattan. The ‘oral motions’ hearing will come less than two weeks before Strauss-Kahn re-appears before examining magistrates in Lille, northern France, where he faces ‘pimping’ charges which could see him imprisoned. Criminal allegations of an attempted rape by Strauss-Kahn in America collapsed last year because of a lack of evidence. But the new hearing, to be heard in New York on March 15th, will allow Diallo a further chance to bring Strauss-Kahn to justice. Claims: Nafissatou Diallo, 32, has complained of a 'sadistic and violent' attack, asking for unspecified damages which are likely to amount to millions of dollars . He has admitted that the pair were involved in a sex act in his suite at the Sofitel in May last year, but insists that they both consented to it. Now Diallo has complained of a ‘sadistic and violent’ attack, asking for unspecified damages which are likely to amount to millions of dollars, said a legal source close to the case based in France. William Taylor, one of Strauss-Kahn’s lawyers, has indicated that Strauss-Kahn will submit a defence of ‘diplomatic immunity’ based on a United Nations convention covering ‘acts committed in a personal community.’ Arrested: Former IMF director Dominique Strauss-Kahn before he was arrested earlier in the week . Arrival: The car of Dominique Strauss-Kahn, former International Monetary Fund (IMF) head, enters the Gendarmerie surrounded by the media as he arrives for questioning by a judge investigating about the 'Hotel Carlton' scandal . Strauss-Kahn argues that his decision . to ‘allow’ Diallo – a stranger he had known for a few minutes - to . perform the sex act on him was legal, although he had admitted to a . ‘moral fault’. The . case, which will be heard by judge Douglas McKeon in a court in the . Bronx, where Diallo lives, could take a number of years, unless the two . parties ‘come to an agreement’, said a source close to the procedure in . Paris. Today it was . unclear whether Strauss-Kahn will attend the hearing in person, although . Diallo will almost certainly be there, said the legal source. Strauss-Kahn . was released on bail from a police cell in Lille on yesterday after . being interviewed about an illegal vice ring based in the city. He . is facing charges of ‘complicity in pimping’ and ‘misuse of corporate . assets’ in relation to a prostitute network centered on the upmarket . Carlton Hotel in Lille. A prostitute has claimed that former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn tried to get her a visa to work in the USA. Judges have already charged a number of men with organising orgies, and a building company executive is accused of using its money to entertain guests at sex parties held in cities around the world, including Paris and Washington DC. Charges: He is facing charges of 'complicity in pimping' and 'misuse of corporate assets' in relation to a prostitute network centered on the upmarket Carlton Hotel in Lille . Strauss-Kahn admits attending many of . the parties - but claims he did not know the girls were prostitutes . because they were 'all naked at the time'. Now it has emerged that one of the women involved claims she flew to Washington DC when Strauss-Kahn was IMF chief. 'There . Strauss-Kahn is said to have tried to get her a visa for her to remain . in the USA,' said a legal source close to the case. 'This . would have huge ramifications on Strauss-Kahn's defence as it would . prove he was assisting a prostitute in her work - something which is . illegal in France. 'The allegation that an IMF chief was trying to get visas for prostitutes would also create a huge scandal.' The woman, who has not been named, is said to have documentary evidence, including pictures of her with Strauss-Kahn. Phone records suggest Strauss-Kahn was in contact with at least 10 call girls. All . of the women, who are mainly French and Belgians from immigrant . backgrounds, claim to have had paid sex with him while he was IMF chief. But Strauss-Kahn's lawyer, Henri Leclerc, said his client was 'totally unaware' that the women were receiving cash. 'At these parties, people were not necessarily dressed, and I defy you to tell the difference between a naked prostitute and any other naked woman,' said Mr Leclerc. Strauss-Kahn's night in a 10ft by 12ft police cell in Lille was his seventh in custody in the past year - but all the rest were spent in the USA where he faced an allegation of attempted rape. While in America Strauss-Kahn complained about having to wear handcuffs, and his humiliation in France also looked likely to lead to protests from his lawyers. His stark cell contained a four inch high foam mattress, a hole-in-the-floor toilet, and an observance window which allowed a police officer to watch him constantly. Strauss-Kahn admits taking part in orgies and said he had an 'uninhibited sex life', but that he 'never paid a centime' for it. 'I have a horror of prostitutes and pimping,' he said. Judicial officials say he will be summoned again next month by three judges who will decide if there is enough evidence to file charges in a case focusing on the alleged prostitution ring in France and Belgium. Strauss Kahn spent just over a week in prison in America following Diallo’s original complaint to police on May 14th last year. When he returned to France Tristane Banon, a 32-year-old writer, accused him of attempting to rape her. Prosecutors found prima facie evidence of sexual assault, but said the alleged attack – which happened in 2003 - was too old to pursue. Strauss-Kahn has consistently denied any wrong doing, although he admits that he had a ‘libertine’ sex life. His wife, the wealthy heiress Anne Sinclair, has stuck by him throughout the legal saga, paying for many of his legal fees.","Alleged victim Nafissatou Diallo has complained of a ‘sadistic .

Bobbing and weaving their way through a small area over the Linville Gorge in Burke County, the strange orb-like illuminations appear to float and glow near a modest peak, according to those who have seen them. Some of the theories about their origin include claims that they reflections from car headlights, brush fires, a paranormal phenomenon - or something entirely natural which science has not yet explained. Scroll down for video . Investigators: Astronomy professor Dan Caton, left, adjusts a web cam as Lee Hawkins, right, looks at an image from the camera on his computer at the Wiseman's View Overlook . Whatever the explanation, the . mysterious lights are attracting tourists in their droves, with scores . making their way to the area in the hope of witnessing the . spectacle for themselves. Tourism . officials are hoping to capitalise on the strange phenomenon, it has been reported. Since the . Brown Mountain Lights were the subject of a cable television . documentary and sparked online communities of amateur . investigators, more and more people have been flocking to the area. Earlier this month, a seminar held at . Morganton City Hall on the Brown Mountain Lights attracted a sell-out . crowd of 120 people, who each paid $20 a head. So popular was the . seminar, there was even a crowd outside the door hoping to get in. Ed Phillips, tourism director of . Burke County, told the Huffington Post: 'It's a good problem to have. I . could have sold 500 tickets.' Another . seminar is in the pipeline, and a contest - with a cash prize for the . best photo of video of the lights - has been thrown open for enthusiasts. T-shirts and fridge magnets featuring the lights have also gone on sale in the area to cash in on the spectacle. Another event which tourist officials hope will take off is the Brown Mountain Paranormal Expedition. Strange phenomenon: Glowing lights appear in the foothills of Brown Mountain.

The Brown Mountain Lights have been the subject of serious scientific interest since the 1920s. It was this time the U.S. Geological Survey issued a report in which scientists claimed the phenomenon was the result of reflections from vehicles, trains or brush fires. However, this might only be part of the explanation, according to Professor Daniel Caton who thinks there is more to it. Caton, a professor in the physics and astronomy department at Appalachian State University, he had been on the verge of abandoning his research into the lights when he started hearing from people who claimed to have seen them up close - just feet away - instead of for miles across the Linville Gorge. According to Caton, these later reports sounded like firsthand reports of ball lightning - a natural but little-understood phenomenon involving spheres of luminous lights which appear to bounce about in the air. Caton is now hoping to catch these balls of light on camera, by setting up cameras at the site that will feed directly to his.

"By . Rupert Steiner and James Salmon . Last updated at 4:42 PM on 27th February 2012 . HSBC is set to strip its executives of part of their bonuses for the role they played in a mis-selling scandal that affected thousands of elderly savers. Britain’s biggest bank is expected to confirm that it will become the latest to claw back shares and cash from a number of senior employees, as it posts annual profits up around 15 per cent to £13.8billion. The news was expected to be revealed as the bank also confirmed a pay package worth up to £12.5 million for its chief executive Stuart Gulliver. Outrage: Executives at the bank are set to lose their bonuses over their part in mis-selling scandal that affected thousands of elderly savers . The banking giant, which makes an estimated 90% of its money outside Britain and has benefited from its exposure to emerging markets in Asia, said UK pre-tax profits rose 17.2 per cent to £1.5 billion. It comes after Lloyds Banking Group last week ‘adjusted’ payouts to 13 directors, reducing them by £2million to reflect the scandal of mis-sold insurance. At HSBC, employees within its Nursing Home Fees Agency had persuaded pensioners as old as 94 to gamble their life savings on risky investments they might not have lived to see pay out. London’s leading shares index fell into the red today with HSBC among the biggest losers despite its huge yearly profits haul. The bank's shares dropped 2 per cent, or 14.1p to 560.9p, after it said profits rose 15 per cent to 21.9 billion U.S. dollars in 2011. Despite posting profits which were the among the biggest ever reproted by a British company HSBC's fourth quarter results disappointed the City. With Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays also on the fallers’ board, the FTSE 100 Index declined nearly 1 per cent, or 51.6 points to 5883.3. The Dow Jones Industrial Average in the US was also in negative territory amid fears that high oil prices - currently trading at about 108 US dollars per barrel after falling from earlier highs - would put a brake on the fragile economic recovery. Thousands of frail care home residents saw their life savings devastated by rogue financial advisers. Sources close to the bank say it is unlikely to reveal details of how many employees will be affected, or how much they will have to return. The board wanted to claw back a chunk of rewards already given to staff to demonstrate their horror at the mis-selling. Last December HSBC was fined a record £10.5million and ordered to repay £29.3million after NHFA was found to have mis-sold investments to 2,485 pensioners between 2005 and 2010. Victims were convinced to part with an average sum of £115,000, often nest eggs from the sales of their homes. Lloyds’s decision last week effectively to fine some of its directors has set a precedent that other banks will find difficult to ignore. HSBC knew it would be in the spotlight . as it becomes the first to link the names of its top bankers with . individual bonus awards. It will publish the list today alongside its . 2011 results, but its rivals will wait until next month.

Mr Gulliver said 2011 was 'a year of major progress for HSBC'. Precedent: .

He said: 'We recorded a strong performance in faster-growing markets and had a record year in commercial banking. 'I am pleased with our progress but there is a lot more to do and we remain focused on delivering our targets.' In the UK, HSBC met its Project Merlin targets agreed with the Government on lending to businesses in 2011, as loans to commercial customers hit a record high. It loaned £49.4 billion to businesses, exceeding its target of £38.8 billion, with £11.9 billion going to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which was slightly higher than its target for a 15% increase on the previous year. Package: HSBC boss Stuart Gulliver is in line for a bonus package of £12.5m . It aims to approve 80 per cent of applications from SMEs in 2012 and is to launch a £4 billion fund to help SMEs in the UK to trade with other businesses overseas in coming weeks. The group also increased mortgage lending in the UK by 12 per cent to £13.2 billion, giving a 9.6 per cent share of the market, up from 2.5 per cet in 2007, and expects to loan £15 billion to homeowners in 2012, with £3 billion specifically for first-time buyers. There is less controversy around HSBC’s bonuses as it did not go cap in hand to the taxpayer for money and is hugely profitable, but it will still be expected to cut pay under intense political and public pressure.

One of the 'Speed Freak Killers' claimed to know where more bodies were buried as he said sorry for waiting years to reveal the locations of two victims. Convicted killer Wesley Shermantine apologised for not telling  authorities where to find the remains of Cyndi Vanderheiden, 25, and 16-year-old Chevelle Wheeler. During the interview at San Quentin State Prison's Death Row, he continued to deny that he killed them, saying he had only helped their killer bury the bodies. Speed Freak Killers: Loren Herzog (pictured left) and Wesley Shermantine are believed to have embarked on a killing spree lasting for several years throughout the 1980s and 1990s . In an interview with the Stockton Record on Saturday, he said: 'I'm sorry I buried their loved ones. In no way, shape or form did I kill them.' Shermantine, 46, also said that additional victims were killed and buried in Modesto, Stockton, Ripon and Milton, California. Cyndi Vanderheiden disappeared in 1998, while Chevelle  Wheeler went missing in 1985. Their remains were found earlier this month after Shermantine provided a map showing the location of a grave site in Calaveras County to authorities. Shermantine and boyhood friend and accomplice Loren Herzog were dubbed the Speed Freak Killers for a methamphetamine-fueled  killing spree across the Central Valley in the 1980s and 1990s, possibly murdering dozens of people before their 1999 arrests. Victims: Cyndi Vanderheiden, left, and Chevelle Wheeler, right, were two of the women killed by the pair . Both were convicted of multiple murders, but Herzog's conviction was overturned on appeal and he was later paroled. The case gained renewed national . attention after Shermantine, who is on death row, recently began . disclosing where victims were buried when bounty hunter Leonard Padilla . offered him money for the information. I'm sorry I buried their loved ones. In no way, shape or form did I kill them. Convicted killer Wesley Shermantine . Herzog . committed suicide last month shortly after learning that Shermantine . had decided to help locate the missing victims' graves. Last week a videotaped police interview from 1999 emerged in which Herzog described how Shermantine raped and killed 25-year-old Miss Vanderheiden. A segment of the videotape, aired on KTVU-TV, showed Herzog being questioned by investigators in a police . interrogation room shortly after his arrest. 'I heard a click - I knew what it was,' Herzog said. 'Man I started gettin' out of the car then, it was too . late, he was already slashing and hacking, man.' Interrogation: The video of Loren Herzog talking to police after he was arrested in 1999 was released by a local television station . Herzog also claimed to be scared of . Shermantine, saying: 'He ain't the same person no more' and suggesting . that his partner had tried to kill him. 'He told me one time, he killed 24 people or somethin',"" Herzog continued. 'I thought he was just being full of s***.' He concluded: 'I wish I could turn the clock backwards, turn the time back.' Investigators digging in the areas specified by Shermantine turned up two bodies and hundreds of bone fragments. Search: Investigators have been digging where Shermantine claimed to have buried bodies. He has now claimed there are additional victims . Shermantine . was convicted of four murders, including that of Ms Vanderheiden and . 16-year-old Chevelle Wheeler, and sentenced to death. Jurors found Herzog guilty of three . murders, but those convictions were later overturned after a judge . determined his confession was illegally coerced.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 9:50 AM on 28th February 2012 . Kathryn Fuller, who barely survived taking contaminated cocaine that killed her 'Amazing Race' producer boss, is likely to be arrested and prosecuted by police in Uganda when she is released from the hospital. Police spokesman Asuman Mugyenyi said . Monday that Miss Fuller is being . treated as a witness and suspect after she was found unconscious on the floor of her hotel February 18 alongside Jeff Rice, who died. The announcement casts doubt on her ability to fully recover from paralysis that has left the right side of her body limp. Her father said she must return home to South African for medical treatment. 'Suspect and witness': Kathryn Fuller is subject to arrest in Uganda when she is released from the hospital, where she is recovering from taking contaminated cocaine . Bad drugs: Jeff Rice (left) has produced episodes of 'The Amazing Race' and other shows for American TV. He was working on a film in Uganda when he and Miss Fuller (right) took cocaine laced with fatal additives . 'Ask people to pray that we come home,' Stuart Fuller, her father, told The Mercury newspaper. Mr Fuller has been staying in the Ugandan capital of Kampala since Miss Fuller was discovered ill. Mr Rice, American TV and film producer, was found dead bleeding from his mouth and nose after taking the cocaine in hotel room he and Miss Fuller were sharing. The pair were in Uganda working on a film Mr Rice was producing. Miss Fuller is currently recovering at a clinic in Kampala, but her father said she needs medical facilities and expertise only available in South Africa. 'She can regain the use of her right side, but needs to come to South Africa for treatment and to recuperate,' Mr Fuller said. However, Miss Fuller must likely face charges of consuming cocaine in Uganda. The case has alerted officials there to the possibility that Uganda is becoming a 'consumption destination,' a spot for adventurers and addicts to take illegal drugs with little risk of police detection. Family man: Mr Rice is the father of two small daughter, aged 7 and 1. He and his wife worked out of Durban, South Africa . Mr Fuller said he was disappointed in his daughter for taking the drugs, but says she has already paid the price for her mistake. 'I am cross, extremely cross. She’s an extremely bright woman who made a mistake,' he said. 'After this, she’ll have to prove herself. We’ve been through hell, but which father wouldn’t rush to support his daughter?' Police arrested Moses Kalanzi, a 23-year-old 'special hire driver,' for supplying contaminated cocaine and heroin to Mr Rice. The driver is co-operating with police and could face charges for his role in the transaction, according to Ugandan newspaper the Daily Monitor. Work: Rice helped producers on The Amazing Race, which follows teams as they travel around the world for a prize of $1 million. He worked on its latest season . 'There was constant communication between the special hire driver and . Rice on phone about the purchase of the drugs,' said a police spokesman. 'So we want to know the . source of the drugs and how it is trafficked into the country.' Father-of-two Mr Rice, 39, who worked on . the series The Amazing Race, was discovered slumped over a table . bleeding from his nose and mouth at the Serena hotel in the capital, Kampala. Family: Miss Fuller's father Stewart Fuller traveled Kampala in the hopes of taking his daughter back to south Africa for treatment . An official toxicology report . confirmed the narcotic with a 'lethal additive' was in Mr Rice’s blood, dispelling initial . suspicions he had been poisoned by attackers or that he had swallowed it to conceal the drugs from police. Mugenyi, the Ugandan police spokesman, said: 'Rice… used cocaine which had lethal additives and that’s what killed him.' Brad Nathanson, a private investigator and friend of Mr Rice, said he had been shown the toxicology report by police and there was no evidence of 'foul play' in Rice’s death. He said: 'In fact it was as a result of buying bad drugs, cocaine to be specific … it was a bad concoction.' 'I have read the toxicology report … it shows that there were small traces of cocaine in their blood and urine.' Mr Nathanson said he had traveled to Uganda as a favor to the Rice family following rumors he had been poisoned. Miss Fuller was found unconscious at the same time Mr Rice’s body was discovered . Mr . Rice and Ms Fuller were believed to have voluntarily consumed the . drugs, meaning she could be prosecuted under Uganda’s drug laws. Drug . use can carry a jail term in Uganda. As . well as the Amazing Race, Mr Rice also worked on Animal Planet's Whale . Wars and the South African version of The Biggest Loser. He is survived by daughters, ages 2 and 7.","Kathryn Fuller's father fears she will not be able to recover from the drugs unless she is brought back to her her in South Africa for treatment .

An eight-year-old boy is today on a ventilator after a chlorine incident at a  swimming pool hospitalised 70 people and left one girl 'barking like a seal'. Most were children and almost all were treated and released following the incident at a community pool in British Columbia, Canada, on Sunday. But Billy Swyers and another adult were kept in. The boy was sitting on the bleachers when fumes were smelt in the air and everybody ran outside. Scary: Most were children and almost all were treated and released following the incident at this community pool in British Columbia, Canada, on Sunday . ‘He's showing signs in his lungs that the doctors aren't happy with,’ the boy’s mother Angela Swyers said after the incident in Williams Lake. ‘So just as a precaution, they are keeping him overnight, giving him some antibiotics, and making sure he's OK before they send him home.’ Mrs Swyers said she was sitting on the seating with Billy when everyone ran out of the pool and many of the children were coughing heavily. At the hospital, Billy was placed on a ventilator and given medication, she said, noting that doctors also performed blood work and an x-ray. ‘I just want to make sure he's better,’ Mrs Swyers said. ‘So we'll do whatever we can to get him healthy and then go home.’ The mother and son live in Quesnel, British Colombia, which sent several youngsters to the swim meet in Williams Lake, about 75 miles away. Location: This map marks the spot in Williams Lake, British Columbia, where 70 people were hospitalised following the swimming pool incident on Sunday . Swimmers from Prince George were also there. A spokesman for Williams Lake described what happened as a ‘chlorine incident’. Chlorine gas can be problematic because it dissolves into the moisture found in the upper and lower airways and forms an acidic compound that irritates the lung tissue and causes swelling . The irritation and swelling can give patients asthma and bronchitis-like symptoms, like wheezing, coughing and shortness of breath and sometimes chest pain . In some individuals, it can also result in bacterial pneumonia . He said authorities are trying to work out what happened at the Cariboo Memorial Recreation Complex, which also includes a hockey arena. He said the pool uses chlorine gas, not liquid chlorine, which is dispensed by a computer. Chlorine is used to sanitise pool water. But in high concentrations, particularly once airborne, the gas can turn toxic and cause a burning sensation in the eyes or breathing difficulties. Kathie Kovacs, of Quesnel, wasn't at the event but drove to Williams Lake after learning her 12-year-old daughter, Janna, went to hospital. ‘When she coughs it sounds like almost like a seal barking,’ Mrs Kovacs said. ‘It's a really, deep horrible cough actually.’ Emergency situation: Authorities are trying to work out what happened at the Cariboo Memorial Recreation Complex, which also includes a hockey arena . Janna ran out of the pool after smelling what she thought was vomit. Some parents said a smaller, shallower pool there had been drained. Janna and Billy were among dozens of children getting ready for the swim meet when one coach said she started smelling ‘something weird’. 'It was pretty scary seeing, like, eight-year-olds with oxygen masks on and stuff. It was scary' Abbi Taylor, 17, coach . ‘People just said: “You've got to get out”,’ said coach Abbi Taylor, 17. She added that a ‘wall of people’ ran to the door when the alert was given. The children, many still wearing wet bathing suits, were ushered to the ice arena before the whole building was evacuated and ambulances arrived. ‘It was pretty scary seeing, like, eight-year-olds with oxygen masks on and stuff,’ Ms Taylor said. ‘It was scary.’ Swimming pool staff trying to solve the problem were coughing and lifeguards were trying to keep people calm, Ms Taylor said. Allison Ruault, health-services administrator for the region, said that 45 children and 25 adults were treated in total after the event.","Incident during event at swimming pool in Canada .

"By . Daniel Bates and Beth Stebner . Last updated at 12:16 PM on 27th February 2012 . Known as America’s first serial killer, his innermost thoughts have remained secret for the last 63 years. But now Howard Unruh’s reasons for killing 13 people in 1949 have finally been made public - including his chillingly clinical confession. Speaking to a prosecutor about how he began his ‘walk of death’, Unruh calmly said: ‘I went over to the shoemaker, pulled the gun and I shot him.’ Scroll down for video . Deposed: Howard Unruh, war veteran who went berserk and shot and killed 13 men, women, and children, is questioned on September 7, 1949 in a Camden, New Jersey, hospital by prosecutor Mitchell B. Cohen . The tranche of files suggests he was paranoid, convinced his neighbours were out to get him and severely damaged due to an incestuous relationship with his mother. Void: In his confession, Unruh was clinical in the way he described the massacre . And on the day of the massacre, his failure to meet up with a gay lover and discovering his home had been damaged could have been the things to send him over the edge. Unruh took just 20 minutes to enter America’s criminal history books when on September 6th 1949, the lithe 6ft-tall man wearing a bow tie shot 13 people and injured three during a rampage through Camden, New Jersey. He used a 9mm German Luger pistol – commonly used by soldiers in WWII - he had purchased two years ago at a Philadelphia shop for the killings, taking aim first at shoemaker John Pilarchik, 27. Aged 28 at the time and an unemployed World War II veteran, he has been described as the first instance in the US of a ‘lone wolf’ gunman going a killing spree. His methodology has been copied many times since. Unruh handed himself in and was convicted, spending more than six decades in jail before dying in 2009 at the age of 88 after a lengthy illness. An investigation by the Philadelphia Inquirer has now unearthed documents about his prosecution and treatment by psychiatrists for the first time, giving a new insight into his motives. Taken down: Unruh was arrested some 20 minutes after he began shooting people . An hour after giving himself up Unruh was sat in the Camden Police Detective Bureau talking to County Prosecutor Mitchell Cohen whom he told: ‘I deserve everything I get, so I will tell you everything I did and I will tell you the truth’ 'Neither of . us said nothing, and I pulled the trigger. He had a funny look on his . face, staggered back and fell to the floor.I then realised he was still . alive, so I fired into his head.' -Howard Unruh . The Inquirer reported that Unruh was interrogated by psychiatrists who used a truth serum to try and discover his motives, a technique which is discredited now but at the time was considered effective. He told them a month after the attacks: ‘I had levelled the gun at (the shoemaker’s), neither of us said nothing, and I pulled the trigger. 'He had a funny look on his face, staggered back and fell to the floor. ‘I then realised he was still alive, so I fired into his head.’ Early years: Uhruh, as seen in his yearbook photo for Cramer Junior High, (left) was described as 'a very quiet fellow'; he also served abroad in WWII . They found that two years before the killings he had decided to ‘become’ gay but was paranoid his neighbours knew his secret. The . night before the massacre began he had been due to meet a man at a . theatre frequented by homosexuals but did not make it due to traffic. John Pilarchik, 27, shoemaker, killed in his store . Helga Zegrino, tailor’s wife killed in husband’s shop . Orris Smith, 6, shot at barbershop . Clark Hoover, 33, barber . Thomas Hamilton, 2, shot in apartment . Alvin Day, 24, television repairman shot while driving car . Jason Hutton, 45, insurance agent shot outside of drugstore . Maurice Cohen, 40, drugstore owner . Rose Cohen, 38, drugstore owner’s wife . Minnie Cohen, 63, drugstore owner’s mother . Helen Matlack Wilson, 37, shot in car . John Wilson, 9, shot in car . Emma Matlack, 68, shot in car . One of the reports from the narcosynthesis session reads: ‘He was very much broken up about that.‘This is the one point in the whole narco when he showed any emotion.’ Unruh . spent several hours brooding at the theatre and went home, only to . discover that the rear gate had been damaged, possibly by a storm. In the early hours of the morning he made up his mind to kill, but waited until 9.30am so the shops were open and his targets would be where he wanted them. Among the other revelations are the details about Unruh’s mother, with whom he lived after his father left their home. In one of his sessions with psychiatrists, Unruh talks about fondling her breasts and mentions how ‘their privates touched’. The report by Dr Robert Bennett says: ‘He never remembers being sexually excited. ‘He showed no emotion whatsoever throughout the entire narco until he started talking about this incident with his mother, being in bed with her, wrestling, etc.’ Unruh also admitted that he had been considering killing his mother, but she fled the morning of the massacre after he threatened to kill her and did not return home.","Howard Unrah killed 13 people in Camden, New Jersey in 1949 .

The Taliban immediately claimed responsibility for the blast in the city of Jalalabad, stating it was in revenge for the burning that has caused an outcry in Afghanistan, triggering a wave of demonstrations and killings. About 40 people have been killed in protests and related attacks since the incident became known last Tuesday, including four U.S. soldiers - two gunned down by a supposedly trusted Afghan driver in a secure ministry in the heart of the capital Kabul. Wreckage: A suicide car bomber killed nine people after striking at the gates of an Afghan airport this morning . Powerful: The bomber drove up to the gates of the airport - which serves both civilian and international military aircraft - shortly after dawn and detonated his explosives in a 'very strong' blast . NATO, France, Britain and the U.S. have pulled their advisers from Afghan ministries out of concern that . the anti-foreigner anger might erupt again. President Barack Obama has apologised . for the burning of Korans that had supposedly been used to pass . messages between prisoners inside the giant US base at Bagram, 40 miles . from Kabul. In a bid to restore order, Afghan . President Hamid Karzai has urged calm, calling on his countrymen not to . allow insurgents to capitalize on their indignation to spark violence . but protests and killings have continued. High alert: Guards stepped up security after the attack, which insurgents said was revenge for U.S. troops burning copies of the Koran . Destruction: Among the dead were six civilians, two airport guards and one soldier. Another six people were wounded . The suicide bomber yesterday drove up . to the gates of Jalalabad airport, which primarily serves international . military aircraft, and detonated his explosives in a 'very strong' blast shortly after daybreak, said provincial police spokesman Hazrad . Mohammad. Among the dead were six civilians, . two airport guards and one soldier, he said. Another six people were . wounded, he said. At least four cars were destroyed in the blast. NATO forces spokesman Capt. Justin . Brockhoff said that no international forces were killed in the attack . and that the base was not breached by the blast. Afghan officials, including the . defence and interior ministers, cancelled planned visits to Washington . this coming week so they could remain in Kabul for consultations about . how to quell the violence. The Taliban has claimed . responsibility too for the murder of the two US officers saying they . were helped into the compound by supporters because of the outrage over . the burning of the Korans. No one has yet been arrested for the . killings. Eight shots were fired at the men - two at the first victim and eight at the second, the official said. The groundswell of anger over the . burning of the Koran, which Muslims revere as the literal word of God, . has highlighted the challenges ahead as Western forces try to quell . violence and bring about some form of reconciliation with the Taliban. The United Nations also scaled back . its operations, moving its international staff from an office in the . northern city of Kunduz that was attacked during protests Saturday, the . organisation said in a statement. The evacuation was ordered 'to put in . place additional arrangements and measures to make sure the office can . continue to operate in safety,' the UN said, adding that the move is . temporary and that staff will be relocated within Afghanistan. Calming: U.S. President Barack Obama (left) has apologised for the inadvertent burning of the Koran, while Afghan President Hamid Karzai (right) is urging calm . Spreading: Protests against the Koran burning started in Afghanistan, and then spread to Pakistan . Despite the pullback, the commander . of NATO and U.S. forces in Afghanistan said that the partnership with . the Afghan government was as strong as ever. 'We are steadfast in our desire to . support our Afghan partners, and will use the extensive range of our . resources to eradicate this heartless insurgency,' General John Allen . said in a statement condemning the Jalalabad bombing. The incident prompted NATO, Britain and France to recall hundreds of international advisers from Afghan ministries. The advisers are key to helping . improve governance and preparing the country's security forces to take . on more responsibility ahead of the drawdown of Western forces planned . for 2014. The U.S. Embassy warned of a . 'heightened' threat to American citizens in Afghanistan and many . Westerners are on 'lock down', meaning they are not allowed out of their . fortified compounds. 'Tensions are running very high here. I think we need to let things calm down, return to a more normal . atmosphere, and then get on with business,' Ambassador Ryan Crocker . said.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 11:14 AM on 23rd February 2012 . A former guest-house owner has been given a new lease of life after taking part in a rare three way kidney swap. Jacinta Ormerod, 58, received a new kidney after her husband donated his to a stranger. The kidney for Jacinta's transplant came using a kidney from an unknown male donor at Manchester Royal Infirmary. In return, her husband Bryn, 60, donated one of his kidneys to be used for another transplant. Relief: Jacinta hopes her new kidney will last 20 years. She organ donation was made possible after her husband Bryn signed onto the National Pairing Scheme . Two other couples involved in the scheme also each gave a kidney - and received one in return. The unusual procedure meant three patients received a desperately-needed organ. It is part of the National Pairing Scheme brought in in 2010 to try to ease a shortage of donors. None of the donors were a match for their own partner but were able to help someone else by 'pairing up' with a stranger. Jacinta, from Higher Moorgate Farm, near Rochdale, Lancashire, said having a healthy kidney was like winning the lottery. She said: 'I now have a man's kidney, a large kidney which they had to put in upside down and literally jam in to get it working. 'Three friends and Bryn had joined the national donor scheme in the hope I could get a match but it was Bryn who came out as the one who could be involved in the three-way transplant.' Jacinta, who has also battled skin cancer for 17 years, described the operation as one of 'military precision'. She said: 'I was in the operating theatre when my kidney was on its way. Bryn was at hospital too having a kidney removed for someone else. 'Now it has been done, it's fantastic. It's remarkable how different I feel. The elation when it was actually working and I found out Bryn was okay, was incredible. He gave someone else his kidney so someone could help me. It was better than winning the lottery.' Jacinta was treated at the Manchester Royal Infirmary. The couple have written to thank the anonymous donor . Jacinta, who was born with Spina Bifida, had a previous kidney swap, but it failed. Bryn then joined the National Pairing Scheme in a bid to find a matching kidney donor. Jacinta, who met Bryn when she was 15, said: 'The fact is, six people are happier. I just feel lucky every day. I'd like to thank the staff and surgeons at Manchester Royal Infirmary for making it all possible. 'I just hope this kidney stays for the next 20 years.' Both Bryn - a director of residential homes - and Jacinta want to raise awareness of the donor register and the National Pairing Scheme. They have written to the anonymous donor couple thanking them for 'giving us our lives back'. Bryn said: 'We don't know who they are, they don't know who we are, but maybe we can see them one day. 'The pairing scheme is incredible. It's so important to be on the transplant list. You can make an unbelievable difference to someone's life.' Afshin Tavakoli, Renal Transplant Consultant at the MRI, said: 'Jacinta's case was very complex and it was thanks to the hard work of the whole team that it was successful. 'As one of the busiest transplant units in the country, we carry out a lot of complex transplants and the pooled donor programme allows us to help patients who may have otherwise still been on the transplant waiting list. 'Our team continue to work hard for the success of the transplant programme and that is always helped when we are able to see patients doing so well after transplant. 'We are really pleased to see Jacinta's positive progress and wish her all the best for the future.'","Jacinta received her kidney from an anonymous male donor .

Quit: PC Douglas Dishington (pictured) was forced to resign over allegations he had an affair with the wife of a man who had called for help . A police officer has quit over allegations that he had an affair with the wife of a man who had called his force for help. Central Scotland PC Douglas Dishington - nicknamed Dishy - was 'required to resign' by the chief constable of the force after a disciplinary meeting last week. The move follows a decision to drop criminal proceedings against the Stirling-based officer, who had at one point appeared in court charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice. Two complaints were received by the force after Mr Dishington became involved in a tangled domestic web. Tony Godley, of Alva, near Stirling, complained that Mr Dishington, 45, had started dating his wife Rebecca, 41, shortly after the police officer had been round to their former matrimonial home. Mr Godley, 44, had called the police in attempt to 'give a fright' to his allegedly-unruly stepdaughter Kayleigh, now 17. But Mr Dishington is said to have given his personal mobile number to Mrs Godley, now Rebecca Watkins, before starting an affair with her shortly afterwards. Mr Godley also complained that Mr Dishington had given lifts to his 12-year-old son in his police car. This included picking him up from school, and driving him home, as well as allegedly on another occasion driving him in the car while he had his blue lights on. A second complaint also came from Kayleigh's father, Jamie Hutton, 44, of Fallin, near Stirling. He alleged that Mr Dishington provided a false alibi for Kayleigh, whom Mr Hutton accused of going round to his house when he was out and removing cigarettes and £1,350 in cash. Prior to last week's hearing, held in Dunblane Police Station under Central Scotland Police's disciplinary code, Mr Dishington had been suspended over Mr Hutton's complaint, which at one stage had led to him being charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice. The case was later dropped. Affair: Tony Godley complained that Mr Dishington, 45, had started dating his wife Rebecca, 41, pictured, shortly after the police officer had been round to their former matrimonial home . Mr Hutton, who gave evidence at the misconduct hearing, said: 'I was out of the house and got a text from my daughter asking where I was. 'I later found out she'd been in the house and when I got home the money and cigarettes were missing. 'I asked the shop round the corner if I could see their CCTV. 'You can also see my daughter going in the house, and leaving shortly afterwards.' He said his daughter was charged with theft, but the case was later dropped due to 'lack of evidence.' He said: 'I was a witness at the hearing, and Dishington gave an alibi for Kayleigh, saying she wasn't there, but the CCTV shows she clearly was.' A friend of Mr Godley said: 'Dishington's a snake. It is right he is not in the position of police officer any more. 'He came into Tony's house, in his role as a police officer, and Tony trusted him, but then Dishington runs off with his wife. HQ: Former officer Douglas Dishington was brought before a disciplinary hearing by his employers at Central Scotland Police . 'Tony was also concerned about his son's welfare. He shouldn't be getting lifts in a police car, especially when the blue lights were on.' Rebecca Watkins said: 'I know about the complaint my ex-husband made to the police, but don't go there - it's a long story.'

In an interview with 610 WTVNM radio in Ohio, Romney, who was lambasted last week for casually mentioning that his wife Ann ‘drives a couple of Cadillacs’, bristled at the suggestion that the number of vehicles his family owned was of any relevance and doubled down on his previous statement. Speaking from Michigan, he said: ‘I don't think anyone here could care less. A month ago, I was asked what cars do we own. Couple: Mitt Romney, arrives on stage with his wife Ann to speak at a rally in Traverse City, Michigan, on Sunday . ‘I pointed out that we had a Ford Mustang, a Chevy truck and Ann has a Cadillac and then we have a second car that we have at our second home, that's a Cadillac that she keeps that she didn’t turn in when she bought the new one.’ Asked how he felt when people attacked him for having ‘a lot more money in some cases than a lot of Americans’, Mr Romney responded: ‘I’m not going to apologise for being successful. ‘In fact one of the reasons I’m in this race is that I believe that my experience in the private sector having competed around the world enables me to know what it takes to get America working again and to bring good jobs back to this country.’ Meanwhile, two days away from Tuesday's critical primary in Michigan, Mr Romney detoured to Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida, for the NASCAR race on Sunday. He visited the track for a few hours . before the scheduled start of the Daytona 500, spoke briefly at the . pre-race drivers' meeting and spent time walking around the garage and . pit areas. Mr Romney was introduced at the drivers' meeting and received hearty applause from drivers, team members and . other VIPs. ‘This combines a couple of things I like best - cars and . sports,’ he said. Rainy day: Mr Romney, second from right, poses with fans before the NASCAR Daytona 500 Sprint Cup series auto race at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida, on Sunday . Mates: Mr Romney, second from left, poses with WWE star John Cena, second from right, and New York Giants NFL football players Osi Umenyiora, left, and Justin Tuck, right, before the NASCAR race . ‘I appreciate the spirit of the men and women that are driving today. This is a chance to really look at some of the determination and great qualities of the human spirit. 'I pointed out that we had a Ford Mustang, a Chevy truck and Ann has a Cadillac and then we have a second car that we have at our second home, that's a Cadillac that she keeps that she didn’t turn in when she bought the new one' Mitt Romney . ‘This is quintessentially American. I . love what you're doing, happy to be here today, wish you all the very . best and God bless this great nation of ours.’ Mr Romney acknowledged that he isn't . necessarily a hard-core fan but has a working knowledge of the sport and . friendships with some of the people involved in racing. 'I have some great friends who are NASCAR team owners,' he said. With a campaign event scheduled in . Michigan later on Sunday, Mr Romney wasn't scheduled to stay for the race - . just as well, because it was postponed until Monday by rain. Mr Romney has also indicated he is confident of winning in Ohio, which votes on Super Tuesday - March 6th - and where his main rival Rick Santorum is currently leading in the polls. ‘10 days ago I was 15 points behind in Michigan. Today I’m up slightly in Michigan. I expect to be able to do the same thing in Ohio.’ Supporters: Mr Romney signs autographs for fans as he visits Daytona International Speedway before the NASCAR Daytona 500 Sprint Cup series auto race in Daytona Beach, Florida, on Sunday . Romney rival: Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum, left, with his daughter, Elizabeth, right, speaks to supporters during a campaign rally on Sunday in Davison, Michigan . Mr Santorum showed no signs of letting up on Mr Romney, stating that by introducing ‘Obamacare lite’ in Massachusetts he had rendered himself ‘uniquely unqualified’ to take on President Barack Obama. ‘I believe in markets, I believe in free people,’ he told a Chamber of Commerce breakfast in Livonia, Michigan. 'One of the reasons I’m in this race is that I believe that my experience in the private sector having competed around the world enables me to know what it takes to get America working again and to bring good jobs back to this country' Mitt Romney . ‘I don’t believe in government telling us what to do. We need someone like that running against Barack Obama, not someone who did “Obamacare lite”. ‘In Michigan, why would we give this issue away? It is the biggest issue in this race. It's about government control of your economic lives, regulating you, taxing you, forcing you to buy things, then forcing their values on you and your religion. ‘Which, by the way, Governor Romney did in Catholic hospitals in Massachusetts by forcing them to distribute the morning after pill. ‘Why is it we give those issues away in the general election? At the core of what's at stake in this country. Why do we put someone up there who's uniquely unqualified to make that case?’ Additional reporting by Mark Duell.

"Convicts include Ernest Bell, 20, who was fined £5 for stealing pigeon . By . David Wilkes . Last updated at 1:32 AM on 28th February 2012 . Moustache immaculately waxed, George Archibald Hewitt looks every inch the Edwardian gentleman ... but he had his stiffly-starched collar felt for using a false cheque. Then there is bowler-hat-wearing  Ernest Bell, whose catalogue of crime included the theft of a bicycle, pigeons and ‘jellies’. Theirs are just two of the portraits in a rogues’ gallery from a century ago which, sartorially, puts today’s hoodie-wearing thugs to shame. The 'mugshot scrapbook' lists George Archibald Hewitt as using a false cheque. The 57-page book from 1909-12 goes on sale at Bonhams in London in March and could fetch more than £1,000 . Ernest Bell, convicted of various misdemeanors, including stealing pigeons. His mugshots form part of a scrapbook compiled by Detective Inspector Robert Mather of the Manchester Police over 100 years ago . A police description of Ernest Bell and a list of his convictions, which shows that he also stole, among other things, bicycles in October 1903 . In all, 65 convicts feature in a scrapbook compiled by a Manchester policeman between 1909 and 1912. Detective Inspector Robert Mather compiled their photographs along with handwritten notes on their physical descriptions, aliases and criminal records and may have used the book to help identify them after arrest. The 57-page book came to light after being put up for sale at auction by its anonymous owner. There are 65 convicts recorded and their details include photographs, physical descriptions, aliases, and their crimes and punishments. A 'half-caste' criminal from 'Martinique Cuba' called Jose Dias (left), alias Joseph Dejouru, was sentenced to deportation in 1908 . While the old time crooks’ neat . appearance makes them look a far cry from their modern counterparts, . their habitual offending was all too often depressingly familiar. Examples include ‘safebreaker’ Thomas Frieth, whose photograph was taken by Barnsley Borough Police in 1911. He apparently used the alias  Welson and is described as being 39, 5ft 5½in with dark-brown hair and grey eyes. His list of convictions includes ‘receiving’, for which he got 18 months, and ‘shopbreaking’, another 18 months. He then received a total of seven . years for two counts of housebreaking and five years for shopbreaking. A . Charlie Chaplin lookalike named Michael Riley – alias James Dolan – was . a pickpocket and received a fine of five pounds and prison terms of 11 . then three weeks. A criminal from ‘Martinique Cuba’ called Jose Dias, alias Joseph Dejouru, was sentenced to deportation in . 1908 after an appearance for robbery in front of Bow Street magistrates . in London. But he stayed and was later convicted . of stealing a golden watch and dressing case, and being in . contravention of his expulsion order. Whether he was ever kicked out . remains a mystery. Samuel Learson, alias Jackson, was convicted of safe breaking . An account of Samuel Learson in the criminal scrapbook which says he has abscess scars around his neck, which might explain the scarf. Among the items he stole were silver shields . Ernest Bell, aged 20 in 1912, was . fined £5 for the pigeon theft and received ‘12 strokes’ for stealing the . bicycle. He went on to serve five years in a reformatory for ‘stealing . jellies’. Then there are the Learson brothers, Samuel and Ernest. Ernest is grinning widely in his mugshot. He is described as being 47 years . old, 5ft 2½in with a light brown moustache and a scar between his . eyebrows. He received six months for shopbreaking. Samuel, who also used the name . Jackson, is said to have ‘abscess scars around neck, scar on cheek and . eyebrow, three dots on right forearm’. Harry Roomains, 53, alias Donahue, was convicted in Liverpool, London, Bolton and Manchester of various misdemeanors . His description contains a pre-internet usage of the @ symbol to illustrate 'alias' He was given six months for stealing . silver shields, six years for housebreaking then five years for . shopbreaking. Harry Roomains, 53, must have been a  thorn in the . police’s side, being convicted of various crimes in Liverpool, London, . Bolton and Manchester and receiving sentences from three months to six . years. Duncan Broady, curator of the . Manchester Police Museums and Archive, said the official records of Det . Insp Mather show he joined the force on July 7, 1890 and got his pension . on January 27, 1921. Born in Stretford, he was a stoker by trade and before joining the police worked for the Manchester Corporation. The book is expected to fetch £1,000 . when it is sold at Bonhams in London on March 27. Manuscripts expert . Simon Roberts, from the auction house, said: ‘This looks like something . the officer compiled for his own use. ‘Although some of the photographs are clearly official police pictures, the rest does not look official. ‘It might have been for his own amusement, but he might also have carried it around with him in order to spot criminals. ‘It measures 7½ inches by 4½ inches so it would have fitted into a large pocket.’ Mr Roberts added: ‘There are collectors who would like to have this and it might appeal to institutions, libraries and archives.’","Manchester Police Detective Inspector compiled rogues' gallery .

"By . Allan Hall . Last updated at 5:30 PM on 26th February 2012 . Berlin wants to send German inspectors to Greece to ensure all taxes that are due are collected. The controversial move will see a 'foreign legion' of 160 or so taxmen head south to try and root out corruption and make sure national coffers are filled in a country where revenue evasion is an art form. Finance department secretary of state Hans Bernhard Beus announced his plan to the WirtschaftsWoche business magazine. Troubles: A fire burns in Athens during protests as the new £108bn Greek bailout is negotiated . It comes just weeks after Europe rejected a German move for a financial 'gauleiter' to oversee all of Greece's books in a bid to avert financial meltdown. But in order to receive billions in bailout funds, Greece has had to agree to fire dozens of underperforming tax inspectors in the coming months. Germany believes its beancounters will be able to drive out in excess of £50billion, either hidden under mattresses or in secret accounts, into the clear light of day and then into state coffers. Last week, European leaders finally agreed a fresh bailout for Greece, worth £108billion. Protest: A demonstrator is detained by riot police as the Greeks negotiated their eurozone bailout. Now Berlin want to send German tax inspectors . Call: George Osborne says IMF should not fund another eurozone bailout . But concern remains throughout Europe that Athens will not be able to meet strict conditions attached. Greece views such an offer as 'humiliating' and believes it to be one more attempt by Germany to take control of the nation piece by piece. Beus' description of his tax squad as 'volunteers' is meant to reduce the tensions between the two countries. Another finance official, Thomas Schaefer of the state of Hesse, said he was looking at calling up a 'dad's army' of retired tax officials to move into Greece to help find the estimated £15 to 20bn in annual undeclared income. 'It would be possible to mobilise such people with large practical experience quite easily,' he said. The German demand comes as Britain and the world's other leading economies in the IMF said they should not be forced to fund another eurozone bailout. Speaking . as finance ministers gather in Mexico for the G20 summit, the . Chancellor said extra funds would not be handed over until countries who . use the struggling single currency commit resources themselves. In . an interview with Sky News, Mr Osborne said: 'We are prepared to . consider IMF resources but only once we see colour of eurozone money and . we have not seen this. 'While at this G20 conference there . are a lot of things to discuss, I don’t think you’re going to see any . extra resources committed here because eurozone countries have not . committed additional resources themselves, and I think that quid pro quo . will be clearly established here in Mexico City.'","160 could be sent to Greece to root out tax corruption .

Magic moment: Craig Etchells goes down on one knee as he asks his partner Sara Duncan to marry him. He had asked permission from her father yesterday . Sara and her fiance Craig Etchells, from Oldham, Greater Manchester, were on the red Daybreak sofa to talk about a touching video they had posted on YouTube.

The video quickly became an internet . sensation after they posted the footage online to share it with their . friends and family. Sara decided to leave her bald head uncovered for the Daybreak interview. Craig revealed during the couple's chat with presenters Kate Garraway and Dan Lobb that he had taken 15 minutes of footage and then cut together the most special moments. He said that the response from the public had been overwhelmingly positive. He added that coping with Sara's cancer had brought the family closer as a whole. 'I'm really proud of Sara,' he said.

"By . Daniel Martin . Last updated at 11:50 PM on 26th February 2012 . Thousands more pensioners may have to sell their family homes to afford inflation-busting increases in residential care fees. Research has found average care home fees have soared by as much as 14 per cent over the past year, forcing families to find hundreds of pounds more every month. Fees are rising because councils, which fund poorer residents, are slashing back the amount they are prepared to pay for them. Painful reading: This table shows the regional variations in the costs of nursing and residential care, and the increases over the last two years . This means private care home operators are making up the difference by increasing prices for everyone else. In London, where the rises have been highest, annual average charges are now £35,300, up £4,400 from a year ago. For those who have to go into a nursing home offering more care and attention, costs are even greater. In counties to the north of London, average charges are £45,100 a year. Across the UK the average residential care home fee is £27,300 – up 5 per cent on a year ago – while nursing home charges have risen 4 per cent to £37,500. The research, by Age UK, revealed a postcode lottery, with pensioners paying far more for residential care in some areas than others. While average fees were highest in the capital at £679 a week, in East Anglia they have soared by 12 per cent to £554 a week (£28,800 a year) and in the North East and Cumbria by 11 per cent to £487 a week (£25,300 a year). Sad state of affairs: More than 20,000 pensioners have to sell their homes every year to pay for the massive costs of residential care, often denying their children inheritance in the process (picture posed by model) The increases are being fuelled by town hall cuts that see extra costs piled on those who pay for their care because they have savings of more than £23,500, while those who have not been thrifty get it free. At least 20,000 pensioners are forced to sell their homes every year to pay the huge costs of residential care, denying their children an inheritance. The increased charges will mean many more will have to sell up. Age UK’s figures, compiled using data from healthcare analysts Laing & Buisson, represent average increases including both the fees paid by councils for state-funded residents as well as those paid by private payers. Self-funders pay around £100 more for their places than councils, meaning the fee increases hide the reality that costs for private residents are rising even more steeply. The figures come just months before ministers set out a long-awaited white paper on reform of social care. Economist Andrew Dilnot suggested in an independent report last summer that there should be a cap of around £35,000 to prevent unlimited charges. But there are indications that insurance schemes to enable this would not be in place for another 15 years. Last night Michelle Mitchell of Age UK said: ‘The under-funding crisis in care is hitting older people hard and self-funding care home residents are unjustly having to foot the bill for cuts to social care. ‘Care home residents aren’t in a position to move and shop around for more affordable deals.  And for those who self-fund, the low interest earned from savings accounts won’t cover these price increases. ‘Older people in residential care need a fair deal when they are paying for their care. ‘To tackle the immediate crisis, the Government has to recognise and close the gap in social care spending.’ Liz Kendall, Labour’s spokesman for care and older people, said: ‘Thousands of self-funders are ordinary people on middle incomes. ‘They have worked hard and saved all their lives and are now being forced to sell their homes to pay for their care, through no fault of their own. ‘The Government is out of touch on this issue, and in denial about the real impact their cuts are having. ‘We urgently need a better, fairer way to fund care for older people. Cross-party talks on this issue, which Labour called for, are now under way.’ Last night Peter Hay of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services said: ‘There is no evidence that care providers, forced to make penny-pinching savings on their local authority contracts, are compensating for the losses by over-charging individual self-funding residents and their families.’","Councils are cutting back on funding for poorer residents .

Wayne Bishop, 34, has finally been locked up after he was released from prison a year ago for after telling the appeal court that custody breached his 'right' to be with his family. Now his jobless sister Sherrie McKinley, 36, has been left looking after Wayne's children - as well as her own six - in her cramped three-bedroom home. Cramped home: Sherrie with her six children and Wayne Bishop's two boys and a girl she is looking after. They are (l to r) Charly, Jade, Chanie, Joe, Te-Jay, Mason who is being held by Sherrie. Then, to her right, are Wayne's children Taylor, Courteney, Kyle, Katie and Brandon . Sherrie, an unemployed divorcee who costs taxpayers £2,500 per month in benefits, branded her brother an 'idiot' after she was left looking after 11 in her tiny property, the People reported. Bishop's children would likely have been put into care if she had not stepped in and taken them under her wing. He was given eight months for carrying out a vicious assault - just three weeks after he was released from custody last year having deployed his human rights argument. Jailed: Wayne Bishop, 34, was finally jailed last week for eight months at Nottingham Crown Court after dodging jail last year 'because prison would breach his human rights' Sherrie told the People: 'He complains about his human rights but what about my own and my kids' human rights? We're all having to make sacrifices because of his stupid mistakes.' Bishop, jailed at Nottingham Crown Court, is likely to be out of prison in just four months. Last year he was behind bars for burglary and dangerous driving - but was released after he appealed. As he was jailed this week, Judge Michael Stokes condemned the . 34-year-old’s cynical exploitation of the European human rights . legislation to try to avoid punishment. Sherrie said that the father-of-five believed the court were going to let him off again so he could look after three girls and two boys. But when he was sent to prison, she had no option but to move them into his property. The small end-of-terrace property they share has two large bedrooms and a third small one - and a single bathroom for all 12 of them. But despite the cramped conditions, they have managed to find room for four televisions - including a monster 50inch set in the lounge. With space at such a premium, the living room is also being used as a bedroom. Sherrie has got herself a king-sized bed which she shares with her son who is just a toddler while the other ten share two bedrooms. The property costs £550 per month to . rent - and the taxpayer contributes £500 towards the bill. In addition . Sherrie, a former hairdresser, claims £2,000 in handouts. Her two eldest daughters, Jade, 18, and Chanie, 17, have moaned that Wayne's children are 'grubby and rude'. Back in jail: Burglar Wayne Bishop celebrating his release last year with his five children and is pictured with a 'world's best dad' mug . Her other children are Charly, 11, Te-Jay, eight, Mason, two, and her nephew Joesph, 15. Bishop's young brood who have moved into Sherrie's home in Clifton, Nottingham, are Courteney, 14, Katie, 12, Taylor, ten, . Brandon, eight, and Kyle, seven. Once the children are settled into her house Sherrie said she might look into seeing whether she can get any further benefits. She added: 'I'm doing it for his five kids, who are my flesh and blood, and face not having a roof over their heads because their stupid dad keeps getting into trouble and letting them down. 'They're devastated that their dad who promised to behave for their sakes has been locked up.' After Wayne was sent to jail, Sherrie blamed her jailbird father Phillip Wheelhouse for her brother’s life of crime. Two of Sherrie McKinley's children make a statement outside Nottingham Crown Court this week as Wayne is jailed . Support: Wayne Bishop's nieces said in a statement outside court that people don't know the full situation about their relative (right) In a statement, read outside court by her daughter Jade, she said: . ‘Perhaps, if as children, we had had the right upbringing and guidance, . instead of our father being in and out of jail all of our childhood . life, Wayne would have been able to think before his actions. ‘Instead he follows our father’s footsteps.’ Mr Wheelhouse, 60, had insisted in an interview last month that his son . had been ‘brought up proper’ – but deserved to go to jail. Sherrie has already spent £90 of her savings buying pyjamas for all of Wayne's children - and three sets of school uniform. The children's real mother is alleged to have alcohol problems - and apparently gave up all right to see them six years ago. Happy family: Bishop, pictured here with his children, was freed from jail after the Appeal Court ruled that locking him up breached his family's human rights . Her parents - and the children's grandparents - are estranged. As Wayne was jailed for eight months, the judge told him: ‘I am afraid, Mr Bishop, you have to learn that other people . have rights apart from you. ‘We all have the right not to have . our homes and premises burgled. We all have the right to walk the . streets without fear of being attacked. ‘The rights that are set out by the . European Convention on Human Rights are not to be produced like the ace . of trumps to avoid a prison sentence.’ Family man?

"By . Amy Oliver . Last updated at 11:49 AM on 28th February 2012 . Dismissed: Major Robert Armstrong escaped a jail term but was dismissed from the Army for keeping top secret documents at home . A decorated Army Major has been dismissed from the forces for keeping top secret documents at home. The documents, along with a gun and . ammunition, were found when Major Robert Armstrong's service quarters in . Lisburn, Co Antrim, were raided in 2009. The 38-year-old had been subject to an investigation into . allegations that he was awarded the Military Cross (MC) for bravery in Afghanistan based on . exaggerated claims. Armstrong, of the Royal Artillery, did not have his MC pinned to his uniform for the sentence hearing at Colchester Military Court yesterday. He listened as prosecutor Lieutenant Colonel Callum Cowx told the court that the documents included 43 confidential, 114 secret and two top . secret, the most sensitive class of information, files. A further 23 . documents were not protectively marked but were potentially sensitive. Mr Cowx added: 'If some of the documents . fell into the wrong hands, it could have had dire consequences for . national security.' The charges relate to possession of the documents, an inoperable Glock pistol, 273 rounds of ammunition and a morphine injector, issued to all personnel for use in theatre. When interviewed by military police, Armstrong said he transferred the documents to his personal laptop so he could work on them at home. He accepted that secure alternatives were available to him, Mr Cowx said. The gun, which had belonged to an Iraqi policeman who died in a bomb attack, was badly fire-damaged and could not be discharged, he claimed. Along with the ammunition, it had been placed in storage and recently returned to him as he moved into new accommodation. He had forgotten the items were there and . was 'taken aback' when they were discovered in the search in May 2009, . Paul Colhoun said in mitigation. Discovery: 182 secret documents, a gun and ammunition, were found during a 2009 raid on Armstrong's quarters in Lisburn, Co Antrim . Award: Armstrong had been subject to an investigation into allegations that he was awarded the Military Cross for bravery in Afghanistan based on exaggerated claims (file picture) Mr Colhoun said: 'There was nothing untoward or sinister about his possession of these items, other than his own oversight. 'There has been no leakage of the information in his possession.' He added that Armstrong, who was of previous good character, was made major in 2006 after joining the Army in 1998. He had served in Afghanistan, Iraq, Cyprus, Germany and Northern Ireland. Armstrong was awarded the MC in March . 2009 - two months before his arrest - for 'consistent bravery and . inspirational leadership' in Afghanistan. The court had heard a criminal . investigation had been launched into how information relating to that . investigation was passed from the Ministry of Defence to the press. Mr . Colhoun asked that that investigation be disregarded in relation to . sentencing as the inquiry was continuing and he is currently entitled to . wear it. He added: 'Along with the . administrative inquiry by the chain of command, I understand there is a . criminal investigation into how information was passed from the MoD to, I . believe, the Sun newspaper.' Armstrong has served as an instructor with the Royal School of Artillery since his arrest. After two-and-a-half hours of deliberation, a court martial board imposed a year sentence suspended for two years. They also ruled he was not fit to continue service in the Army and would be immediately dismissed. Court: Armstrong, of the Royal Artillery, did not have his Military Cross pinned to his uniform for the sentence hearing at Colchester Military Court . Judge Jeff Blackett described Armstrong as an 'outstanding field soldier'. But he added: 'There was no doubt that you knew you should not have retained these items. 'You have taken a very cavalier attitude to the handling of dangerous and potentially very damaging material.' He added that the documents could have threatened the 'internal security of the UK' and led to 'widespread loss of life'.","Major Robert Armstrong had two 'top secret' files and a Glock handgun with 273 rounds of ammunition .

The image, which officials believe to be genuine, was posted on the social networking site to mark a remembrance day for the victims of a series of neo-Nazi murders. Police fear a Nazi-sympathiser movement may be developing within the ranks as the man is wearing what appears to be an authentic uniform with . the Berlin police badge on the right arm. Offensive: This photograph of a Berlin police officer making the Nazi salute sparked outrage after it was posted on Facebook . An investigation has now  been launched by . the Office for the Protection of the Constitution in an attempt to . track down the rogue officer. Between . 2000 and 2007, nine foreign-born food vendors and shop owners, were murdered by a far right group known as the known as  National Socialist Underground or NSU. At first police wrongly assumed they were mafia or drug-related killings. Remembrance: German Chancellor Angela Merkel gives a speech at a memorial ceremony for the victims of a series of neo-Nazi murders yesterday . The truth was only uncovered three months ago after two members of the gang committed suicide following a botched bank robbery. Officers recovered neo-Nazi items alongside a film showing the victims' bodies . set to montages of a Pink Panther cartoon character. Yesterday Chancellor . Angela Merkel gave an address before 1,200 guests at Berlin's Concert . House where she apologised to the victims’ families. She said: 'The murders of the terror cell were an attack on our country.

The cost of keeping watch on Abu Qatada on bail comes to about £5million a year, it has emerged - a hundred times more than keeping him in a high-security jail. The Islamist cleric is subject to a surveillance operation costing a £100,000 every week, as authorities monitor his every move to ensure he does not escape. Now police are warning the phenomenal cost of keeping an eye on Qatada is diverting money from murder investigations, and could lead to up to 12 going unsolved each year. Surveillance regime: The cost of keeping an eye on Abu Qatada has spiralled to a phenomenal £5million a year, the cost of keeping three murder squads . Peter Smyth, chairman of the Police Federation, told the Sunday Times: 'You are talking about the cost of three murder squads and the average murder squad would probably be dealing with between eight and 12 murders a year. 'These surveillance teams are meant to be tackling active criminals.' Qatada was released on bail two weeks ago to live with his wife and children at the home in Wembley, London, after six-and-a-half years in Long Lartin prison, Worcestershire. The Jordanian cleric - whose real name is Omar Mahmoud Mohammed Othman - is facing deportation to stand trial over terror charges in his home country. But a judge ruled he should be released after he applied for bail and human rights judges in Europe ruled he could not be deported without assurances that evidence gained through torture would not be used against him. According to his bail conditions, Qatada must observe a 22-hour curfew which allows him out of his home for just two one-hour periods each day. He is banned from using mobile phones and is only allowed to meet people who have been security vetted and pre-approved by the Home Secretary. In order to enforce the tight security regime, dozens of police officers and intelligence agents have been drafted in for an intensive surveillance operation. Every word spoken on Qatada's home telephone is monitored, recorded and analysed by an officer at a police listening station. An interpreter is on hand to transcribe conversations held in Arabic. Picking up a few bits: Qatada is only allowed to leave his home for two one-hour periods each day, and when he does he is tailed by undercover police and MI5 agents . A court order allows the security services to install inside Qatada's home 'such equipment as may be considered necessary to ensure compliance' with his bail. All calls are intercepted and recorded. A duty translator transcribes any conversations in Arabic. Police have kitted out Qatada's home with cameras and microphones to capture every word spoken inside. The vehicle has a tracking beacon installed and a bug to monitor any conversations within. Qatada's electronic ankle tag will trigger an alarm if he leaves home without consent. As well as marked police cars in his street, undercover officers are stationed in a nearby unmarked car to watch comings and goings from his home. Police and MI5 teams follow Qatada on foot whenever he leaves his home. The means a network of cameras and microphones will have been installed throughout the house, monitoring and recording every word he and his family utter. The Ministry of Justice has contracted Serco Electronic Monitoring, a private security company, to monitor his curfew by means of an electronic tag. The tag transmits a signal to a monitoring unit installed at his house, which then relays the information back to the company's monitoring centre. In the two hours he is allowed out of his home, Qatada's movements are heavily restricted and he is confined to a marked boundary believed to be just a few miles in circumference. Marked police cars are permanently stationed outside Qatada's house, but when he sets foot outside he is also tailed by mobile surveillance teams based in unmarked cars and on foot. Although most of these will be police from the Met's covert surveillance teams, some are experienced intelligence specialists from MI5's A4 surveillance department. The revelations of the precise details of the expensive surveillance regime come just a week after it emerged it could take years to deport Qatada back to his home country. Theresa May, the Home Secretary, is due to fly out to Jordan to try to drum out a deal that could clear the way for him to be sent back there. But even if she does reach an agreement with Jordanian authorities, Qatada could launch a fresh legal challenge in British courts and possibly Europe. The legal battle could potentially last a number of years, meaning Qatada would be allowed to stay in the UK until it came to a conclusion.","Mammoth surveillance operation costing £100,000 a week .

Skipping regular dental check-ups could end up costing you ten times as much money in the long run, according to a report by the PEW Centre. More and more Americans are checking into the Emergency Room with complaints such as toothache, which could easily have been prevented and at a far lower cost. The number of ER visits nationwide for dental problems increased 16 per cent from 2006 to 2009 the report showed, and analyst fear the trend is set to continue. Costly: People who forgo regular dental checks or don't brush their teeth regularly could face heightened costs for Emergency Room treatment. Preventive dental care such as routine teeth . cleaning can cost $50 to $100, versus $1,000 for emergency room . treatment that may include painkillers for aching cavities and . antibiotics from resulting infections. These infections can be dangerous, especially in young children, who may develop fevers and dehydration from preventable dental conditions. In Florida, for example, 200 children were hospitalized in 2006 for those types of infections. Hospital information from 24 states was . analysed, as well as data from the federal Agency for Healthcare . Research and Quality and studies on dental care. Researchers claim the problem stems from a shortage of dentists, particularly those willing to treat Medicaid patients. In Florida, for example, only 10 per cent of dentists participate in the programme. They also highlighted the recession as a contributing factor. When a family member loses a job, dental care may take a back seat to food and other necessities. In 2009, 56 per cent of Medicaid-enrolled children nationwide received no dental care. South Carolina ER visits for dental-related problems increased nearly 60 per cent from four years earlier. Tennessee hospitals had more than 55,000 dental-related ER visits - five times as many as for burns. But Dr. Frank Catalanotto, a professor at . the University of Florida's College of Dentistry, warned that using . emergency rooms for dental treatment ‘is incredibly expensive and . incredibly inefficient’. Emergency Rooms are not generally staffed by dentists and are not equipped to deal with dental problems, meaning that many patients end up returning when they cannot find or afford follow up treatment. Shelly Gehshan, director of Pew's children's dental campaign, added: ‘Emergency rooms are really the canary in the coal mine. If people are showing up in the ER for dental care, then we've got big holes in the delivery of care. ‘It's just like pouring money down a hole. It's the wrong service, in the wrong setting, at the wrong time.’","Reliance on emergency room treatment jumps 16% .

When Britain's most famous new town Milton Keynes was built in 1967 it quickly became the target of ridicule for its soulless buildings and grid systems. But even its infamous concrete cows have not put off developers from attempting to build Britain's biggest new town. Plans have today been revived for the creation of Northstowe, a 10,000 home development northwest of Cambridge. Plans: An artist's impression of Northstowe, the new Cambridgeshire town which, if it goes ahead, could house up to 25,000 people . Development: Northstowe will have 150 houses built in the initial phase, followed by 650 by 2016 . The town, which was once seen as the prototype for Labour's now-abandoned ecotown programme, could take up to two decades to complete and could be home to up to 25,000 people. The initial phase of development for the town will see the creation of a primary school, sports hub, shops and a recycling centre. The joint promoters of the Northstowe project, Gallagher and the Homes and Communities Agency, consulted with the public before submitted plans for 1,500 new homes today. Ambitious: The plans for Northstowe could take up to 25 years to fully complete . Developers hope that as well as providing green, sustainable homes, Northstowe will also have a mix of executive homes, as well as low-cost and social housing. Tim Wotherspoon, South Cambridgeshire . District Council's cabinet member for Northstowe and new communities, . said: 'We are delighted the application for the first phase of new homes . and community facilities at Northstowe has now been submitted as the . town is vital to responding to the acute housing need in south . Cambridgeshire. 'It will bring with it new jobs, a major boost for our flourishing economy, and will help address the need for affordable homes. 'We . are very clear that the proposals must be best for existing and future . communities and the views of our residents are key to that. 'This is to be our new town and all of us locally are determined to make it work well for everyone.' South Cambridgeshire District Council will now work with Cambridgeshire County Council to assess the application. Big plans: Northstowe will be the biggest new town built in this country since Milton Keynes in the 1960s . Northstowe . Parish Forum - a group of 12 local parish councils near to the proposed . new town - have helped with the preparation of the plan. A decision on the plans is expected to take up to a year. Plans for Northstowe's second phase will be prepared over the summer, while later developments would include a town centre and a secondary school. Steve Collins, the Homes and Communities Agency area manager, said: 'The joint promoters are confident Northstowe can be delivered and have adopted a new phased approach to delivering housing as part of the comprehensive development of the wider vision for Northstowe as a new community. 'Gallagher submitting the phase one application is fully supported by the HCA as it is part of the revised master plan for the whole site, the majority of which HCA owns. It’s therefore a major milestone for the project as a whole. Inspiration? Milton Keynes now has a population of over 230,000 after it was made in 1967 . Iconic: The concrete cows built in Milton Keynes have become a landmark in the Buckinghamshire town . 'We remain committed to delivering Northstowe with all the benefits it will bring to the local and wider area and together the joint promoters will be working together on preliminary plans for a phase two over the summer.' Northstowe, built five miles north-west of Cambridge, will be the UK's biggest new town since Milton Keynes. The . town, known as MK to locals, was formally designated a town in 1967, . having incorporated the existing towns of Bletchley, Wolverton and Stony . Stratford. Arguably the biggest (and perhaps only) landmark in Milton Keynes is the collection of concrete cows, which were built in 1978 by American artist Liz Leyh. She is thought to have created them as a leaving present to the Milton Keynes Development Corporation before she returned to the U.S. The Buckinghamshire town was created to help ease housing overspill in London, and now has a population of around 232,000.","Northstowe will take 20 years to finish but could have population of 25,000 .

Whereas some of us might moan about our commute taking up a few hours of every day, spare a thought for those who make astonishing journeys across hundreds of miles just to get to work. The ‘super-commuter’, who works in one city but lives in another, is on the rise in the U.S. and especially in Houston and Dallas in Texas, where they make up 13 per cent of the workforce. They are followed by Phoenix, Arizona; Atlanta, Georgia; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which all have seven to eight per cent of their workforce based outside the city’s statistical area. Changing patterns: The 'super-commuter', who works in one city but lives in another, is on the rise in the U.S. and especially in Houston and Dallas in Texas, where they make up 13 per cent of the workforce. The stars in this diagram represent major cities and the circle sizes represent other cities where the workforce comes from . New York: The report found U.S. super-commuters tend to be aged less than 29 years old and while 'twin cities' in the past were typically 40 miles apart they can now be  up to 200 miles apart. The circles represent other cities from which people commute into Manhattan, and their size shows the rise in local long-distance commuters . Los Angeles: Around 10,000 workers travel 400 miles south from Sacramento to the famous California city . Karl Sparre, 56, of Boston, right, makes the 600-mile $130 round trip to Philadelphia every week. He gets a 7:20am flight to Pennsylvania on Monday and is home in Massachusetts by 7:30pm on Friday. His plane ticket cost will soon go up to $220. The father works for food services company Aramark and drives or takes the train to and from his sister’s house in Wilmington, Delaware, during the week - a journey which takes an hour. He once had a 30-minute drive to work for financial firm Sun Life in Boston before he lost his job, failed to find work locally and decided to take the Philadelphia job a year ago. ‘The super-commuter typically travels once or twice weekly for work, and is a rapidly growing part of our workforce,’ wrote the authors of a New York University report released last week. They cite changing advances in wireless technology as one major reason for this shift, with many employees working on their way to and from work, and living in cheaper areas to their office’s city. In addition many qualified workers don’t want to sell their homes and move if they are offered a new job - but do want to take the employment offer with the jobless rate still at 8.3 per cent in the U.S. ‘The global economy has rendered the clock irrelevant,’ the Rudin Center for Transportation report said. ‘The workplace is no longer fixed in one location, but rather where the worker is situated.’ Areas where workers in one city live . have expanded to other cities and metropolitan areas often hundreds of . miles apart, which is resulting in greater economic integration, the . report said. This is seen for example in Los . Angeles, California, where 10,000 workers travel 400 miles from . Sacramento - and in Chicago, Illinois, where 5,000 workers travel 300 . miles from St. Louis, Missouri. Super-commutes . from Dallas to Houston in Texas had more than tripled in 2009 compared . to 2002, and they had doubled between Northern California and Los . Angeles, as well as from Boston, Massachusetts, to Manhattan, New York. Southwest Airlines runs an astonishing . 25 flights a day on the 240-mile route between Houston and Dallas, . which is effectively a bus service shipping commuters across Texas, . reported Bloomberg.

Mrs Campbell herself had also had abnormal cells at the age of 25 and was successfully treated. But tests showed that Cathy’s cells had already developed into cervical cancer and were spreading around her body. 'So unfair': Cathy Newton (left) died from cervical cancer at the age of 25. Her mother, Wendy (right) is now campaigning for the eligible age for smear tests to be lowered . Despite having chemotherapy, Cathy, a mother of two, was unable to fight the disease and died, aged just 25, in February last year. Now Mrs Campbell is campaigning for the age of cervical smear tests to be lowered as she says if Cathy was tested earlier than 25 the disease may have been caught in time. Mrs Campbell, 46, who lives in Stoke on Trent, Staffordshire, said: ‘Now we are campaigning for a change in the law to lower the age for smear tests from 25. ‘Girls should be having them as soon as they are sexually active. How many more mums need to lose their daughters before the Government does something. ‘We don’t want her death to be in vain. Her children may grow up without their mum, but we don’t want this to happen to anyone else.’ Family left behind: Cathy pictured with her two children and husband Alex Bates, whom she was able to marry just hours before she passed away last February . Cathy had her first smear test in August 2010. She had suffered bleeding after she had given birth to her first daughter, now five, but hadn’t gone for a check up because she was below the age of 25 and wasn’t eligible for a smear test. The results of her smear test came back showing abnormal cells in her cervix. Mrs Campbell said: ‘It really was like history repeating itself for me, as I’d had abnormal cells after my first smear test at the age of 25. ‘Cathy was worried, but I told her not to worry as I’d had laser treatment and then been given the all clear and I was sure that was what was going to happen to Cathy too.’ But then more investigative tests a few weeks later revealed that she did have cervical cancer. Mrs Campbell said: ‘She rang me crying down the phone to tell me that she had cancer. I started crying too. It seemed so unfair. She had two little girls aged five and three. Were they going to lose their mum.’ Cathy underwent gruelling chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment and two months later the doctors told her the cancer was in remission. She and fiance Alex Bates, 26, made plans to get married and she celebrated Christmas Day with her family. But just four days later she started with agonising pains in her stomach. The doctors initially thought it was scarring from the radiation treatment, but after several weeks she was struggling to eat anything. Scans showed the cancer had spread to her stomach. Mrs Campbell said: ‘We were all devastated. She’d beaten the cancer once, only for it to come back in her stomach. ‘Doctors told her that it was a very rare cancer, linked to cervical cancer, and they said they didn’t know how long she had left.’ Cathy wanted to get married, but she was too ill to say the vows, so instead a vicar blessed the wedding rings and Mr Bates said both their vows. Mrs Campbell said: ‘It was heartbreaking. Cathy had gone downhill so fast. She managed to slide the ring onto Alex’s finger, and just a few hours later she passed away. ‘I couldn’t believe that I had lost my daughter like this. Only a few weeks before we thought she had beaten the cancer. But now her life as a mum and a wife had been halted by this cruel disease.’ Mrs Campbell is now campaigning for a change in the law. Cervical cancer screening has been limited to women aged 25 and over since 2004 because so few under-25’s were found to have the disease. Local health trusts cannot lower the age limit until the Government changes national policy. She said: ‘Cathy had a smear test as soon as she was eligible to do so, but her death has made us realise that there must be 17 and 18-old-girls out there who may have cancer and don’t know about it. ‘By the time they have waited for a smear test, it could be too late.’ Mrs Campbell is now backing a campaign to have the age of smear tests lowered to 20, which has already attracted a 20,000-name petition since being started by relatives of 23-year-old Claire Allan after she died from the disease in 2009.","Cathy Newton didn't go for check-up despite bleeding after childbirth as she wasn't old enough .

It comes just days after the Daily Mail revealed just 9 per cent of the 2012 memento collection is made here. The scarf will be available in Next stores in May, costing £5 for a 20in one or £10 for a 35in version. All proceeds will go to the British Olympic Association and British Paralympic Association and it is hoped it will raise up to £10million for the athletes. The cotton voile scarves feature the Team GB logo or the British Paralympic Association logo on a background of more than 2,000 black ‘hieroglyphs’ – symbols representing the Olympic sports and London. Flying the flag: Five-time Olympic gold medal rower Sir Steve Redgrave, Olympic silver medalist Sharron Davies and para-equestrian Lee Pearson unveil the two designs of scarves at the Saatchi Gallery in London yesterday . The symbols include 900 figures to represent the 900 Team GB and Paralympics GB athletes, 900 hearts ‘to express the nation’s special love’, 900 stars ‘to recognise that every one of our athletes is a true star’ and 60 hands to symbolise 60million GB supporters. English roses, Welsh daffodils, Northern Irish flax and Scottish thistles also feature on the heavily-patterned scarf as well as national landmarks and the date of the opening ceremony. The scarf has been described as ‘an iconic memento of the London 2012 Games’ and the BOA has agreed for Olympic sponsor Next to manufacture an initial run of 500,000 scarves. Adidas, another sponsor, will have its logo on the scarves and help sell them through its outlets. The scarves are one of two pieces of Olympic merchandise which the BOA are allowed to keep net profits from, following an agreement with the London 2012 organising committee. Rich tapestry: The cotton voile scarves feature the Team GB logo or the . British Paralympic Association logo on a background of more than 2,000 . black ‘hieroglyphs’ – symbols representing the Olympic sports and London . The second item, a ‘collectable’ produced in partnership with BP, will be launched at the end of May. The . association has spent more than two years working on the design for the . scarves, which come with a letter from five-time gold medallist Sir . Steve Redgrave, encouraging people to ‘wear it, wave it and help Team GB . WIN with it!’ The BOA hopes to sell at least one million of the scarves, which some have described as looking like tea towels, in an attempt to mirror the success of the 2010 Vancouver winter Olympics – where 4.3m pairs of red mittens were sold, raising millions for the organising committee. BOA chief executive Andy Hunt said the scarves were vital for building support for the games. He said: ‘We would love it to be a massive success. Here is an item you can take to show you have gone out and supported the team.’ The scarves will be available online WHEN and in Next stores from May – but may not be on sale in any of the official London 2012 merchandise stores in Olympic venues, due to a row between the BOA and Locog, which controls the shops. The BOA will have to share profits from any sales in initial shops with Locog, which needs merchandise income to meet the £2.2bn running costs of the Games. The BOA also announced that it will be opening a museum close to the main stadium and aquatic centre in the Olympic Park after the Games. The £10m project will celebrate London’s status as the only city to have hosted the Olympics three times, and could include memorabilia from every member of Team GB at this summer’s event.","Meant to show patriotic support, but garments will be made in India .

Mix-up: A new mother was given the wrong newborn in hospital, which she subsequently breastfed not knowing it wasn't her child (picture posed by model) A new mother was left breast-feeding someone else’s baby after blundering hospital staff gave her the wrong child, a hearing was told yesterday. Two newborns had been taken away to be cared for just hours after being born, while their mothers rested, the Nursing and Midwifery Council heard. But ward staff later returned the wrong babies to the women, known as Mother A and Mother B. When the mix-up was noticed, midwife Jill Ashmore failed to record it and even tried to convince a student not to ‘drop anybody in the s***’ by keeping quiet about it. David Clarke, for the NMC, said Ashmore also told Mother A that her baby had not been fed, when in fact it had been breast-fed by the other mother. The blunder happened at Bassetlaw Hospital in Worksop, Nottinghamshire, on November 13, 2007. Mr Clarke said: ‘Both of the babies were having some trouble settling and were taken from their mothers, with the agreement of the mothers, to a different area where they were looked after by midwives and health care assistants. There was a mistake on their return – in fact there were two mistakes – as Baby B was returned to the Mother A, and Baby A was given to Mother B. ‘When the mistake had been realised, they were recovered and given back to the correct mothers.’ When Ashmore returned Baby A to Mother A, she told her the child had not been fed without checking if this was the case. Probe: The blunder happened at Bassetlaw Hospital in Worksop, Nottinghamshire, on November 13, 2007 . ‘As it turns out,’ said Mr Clarke, ‘the baby had been fed; breast-fed by Mother B, who at the time had thought she was feeding her own baby.’ The panel heard that when the blunder was reported to the hospital, Ashmore told student midwife Claire Newton-Jones to say the bare minimum during an internal investigation. Ashmore admits she failed to record the error in notes and to inform anyone during a shift change, but denies misconduct. She is not attending the central London hearing, but if found guilty of misconduct she faces being struck off. The hearing continues.","Midwife didn't record mix-up, misconduct hearing heard .

A Kansas woman who left a hair dryer running to warm her infant daughter on a freezing night has been sentenced to three years' probation for the baby's death from hyperthermia. Brigit Hippen of Hutchinson pleaded no contest last month to involuntary manslaughter in the February 2010 death of her 2-month-old daughter, Karina Perez. Hippen's sentencing Tuesday spared her from a second-degree murder charge she previously faced. Probation: Brigit Hippen has been sentenced to three years' probation for her baby's death in 2010 after having pleaded no contest to involuntary manslaughter . Hippen told investigators she placed a running hair dryer near Karina's bassinet in the bathroom of her apartment to warm the baby, then she fell asleep herself in the other room. When she woke, three hours later, she found the baby unresponsive. Doctors have said Karina's temperature was 108 when she died. Overheated: Hippen said she left a hairdryer blowing toward her baby Karina before falling asleep for three hours and then found the infant unresponsive . 'She didn't mean to, but she fell asleep. She just fell asleep,' Hippen's attorney David Harger previously said in court according to the Hutchinson News. Mr Harger described Hippen and the baby's father Oscar Perez as being 'devastated' by the baby's death. Prosecutors painted a different picture saying Hippen, who was 20 at the time of her baby's death in 2010, acted with 'extreme indifference to the value of human life,' according to the paper. Arguments: Hippen's defense described the baby's parents as devastated by her death while prosecutors claimed the mother was unable to grasp the value of another human life . Hippen still faces trial for a separate case in which she is charged with felony criminal damage to property and misdemeanor battery in a separate incident. The trial in that case is tentatively set for February 28. This case centers on an incident which occurred on May 29 of last year, when she allegedly punched another woman in the face for dancing with her boyfriend. Hippen is also caused of damaging the woman's car.","Baby's temperature was 108 when she died .

David H McCarthy, 27, came to the door of Michelle Lech early on Sunday morning and asked if he could speak to her. He then calmly sat at her kitchen table and confessed to the fatal accident. Melissa Lech, 20, was struck and killed on August 7, 2008 as she walked home from a restaurant in Joliet, Illinois. Guilty conscience: David H McCarthy (left) came to the home of Michelle Lech and confessed to killing her sister Melissa Lech (right) in a hit-and-run in the town of Joliet, Illinois in 2008 . McCarthy had tracked down the dead woman's sister over the internet. His motive is unclear. When he left, she called Detective John Ross, who has been involved in the case from the beginning, and told him about the visit. After running the licence plate she had noted down, Detective Ross was able to locate the 27-year-old in the nearby town of Naperville. Police went to McCarthy's home where he appeared to be waiting for officers. His family, who were unaware of the accident, were 'deeply distressed' at the pain caused to the Lech family, according to the Chicago Tribune. McCarthy has been charged with causing personal injury and leaving the scene of an accident causing a death. He is being held on $1million bail.

"By . Beth Stebner . Last updated at 7:22 PM on 25th February 2012 . They say never mix politics and romance, but one Virginia delegate must have missed the memo. Republican David Albo addressed the House of Delegates last week and described how he unsuccessfully tried to seduce his wife days before. His wife wasn’t upset over unwashed dishes or a promise he didn’t keep – she refused him sex after seeing him support the controversial bill requiring women seeking an abortion to first get a trans-vaginal ultrasound. Scroll down for videos . Denied: Republican delegate David Albo said his wife denied him sex after seeing the debate over a controversial abortion bill forcing women to get probes before the procedure, which he supports . For all to hear: Albo took his grief to the Virginia House floor and bemoaned his chances of getting lucky . Mr Albo took the floor last Friday to tell a sad story. He had put the children to bed, and he had red wine. The night was ripe to have an intimate moment with his wife, Rita. He said he had a ‘giant’ 48-inch television that he turned on to the Redskins game because ‘my wife loves the Redskins more than she loves me.’ He put on ‘mood music’ on the House floor and pantomimed putting his arm around his wife. But he said the romantic mood was killed while they were flipping through channels. Mood killer? Rachel Maddow slammed GOP lawmakers in Virginia for pushing the unnecessary medical procedure on women seeking abortions in the portion of the show Albo and his wife watched . One less: Del. Albo said there would be one less Republican in this world because of watching the show . Mr Albo landed on The Rachel Maddow Show, which was discussing the details of the bill and the ‘more amazing by the minute’ stance Virginia’s Republican base has on the bills. Rachel Maddow pointed out the hypocrisy that Virginia’s Republicans were calling for smaller government, but were fully supportive of requiring women to get a medically unnecessary ultrasound. Del. Dave Englin, a Democrat, spoke on the show about the repercussions of the bill and what it would mean for Virginia women seeking abortions. Mr Albo told the House floor: ‘It was trans-v this, and trans-v that.’ ‘The show’s over, and she looks at me and goes, “I gotta go to bed.”’ He told the House floor: ‘If the gentleman’s plan was to make sure there was one less Republican in this world, he did it.’ His tawdry monologue was met with several cheers and guffaws as well as applause. The bill has sparked outrage separate from the Maddow show – from spoofs on Saturday Night Live and The Daily Show With Jon Stewart to a protest outside of Capitol Hill. Lampooned: On last week's SNL, Seth Myers and Amy Poehler also poked fun at the bill . It originally required women seeking an abortion to undergo a trans-vaginal sonogram, in which a wand is inserted in the vagina to yield an image of the fetus. The bill originally required women seeking an abortion to undergo a trans-vaginal sonogram, in which a wand is inserted in the vagina to yield an image of the fetus. The procedure differs from an abdominal sonogram – often portrayed in movies and TV shows - in which a wand is rubbed over the woman's belly. Seven states have laws mandating some form of pre-abortion ultrasound exam. The Guttmacher Institute, which researches abortion-related issues, said none of the ultrasound laws in other states explicitly require the trans-vaginal procedure. However, Elizabeth Nash, Guttmacher's state issues manager, said several of the laws, including a Texas measure recently upheld in federal court, effectively leave doctors with no option but the trans-vaginal procedure. That's because an abdominal sonogram does not produce the detailed image of a first-trimester pregnancy that is required by some of the laws, Ms Nash said. The procedure differs from an abdominal sonogram – often portrayed in movies and TV shows - in which a wand is rubbed over the woman's belly. In part because of public ridicule, the bill is now being offered in a watered-down format and is supported by Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell. Gov. Bob McDonnell and GOP state lawmakers abandoned a bill last Wednesday requiring women to undergo an intrusive type of sonogram before an abortion - an abrupt reversal that demonstrated the power of political satire and illustrated again how combustible the issue of women's reproductive health has become over the past few weeks. 'You never want to get on the wrong side of popular culture,' said Steve Jarding, a professor at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government told the Associated Press. In Virginia, the bill began muscling its way through a legislature that recently came under the rule of GOP conservatives. It moved ahead despite an outcry from women and Democrats, including a female lawmaker who called it 'state-mandated rape' and another who made her point with a failed amendment requiring rectal prostate exams for men seeking Viagra prescriptions. It didn't fully jump the fence from politics into pop culture until Saturday Night Live lampooned it on Saturday. 'Really?' comedian Amy Poehler sneered in noting the Virginia bill on SNL.

Authorities have named a 'person of interest' in the disappearance of a fireman and father-of-two who has been missing for more than 10 days. Jerry Perdomo, 31, of Orange City, Florida, had driven 1,500 miles to see a friend and was last seen at a house in Jackson, Maine on February 16. Police spent the weekend searching the rural home, owned by the father of Daniel Porter, 24, whose girlfriend is 25-year-old Cheyanne Nowak. Missing father-of-two: Jerry Perdomo, 31, of Orange City, Florida, was last seen at a rural home in Jackson, Maine, earlier this month on February 16 . Porter has now been named as 'a person of interest' in the case. Police believe he and his girlfriend were the last people to see Perdomo. The pair were tracked down in Connecticut in the past week and interviewed by police before retuning to Maine. Investigators have impounded three vehicles, including Mr Perdomo's rental car found abandoned in a Wal-Mart car park in Bangor, Maine. The second was left at a dealership in . Oakland, Maine, after Porter and Nowak bought a car there - and . the third is a car owned by Porter. 'The connection between Perdomo, Porter and Nowak, we're still trying to piece together,' Stephen McCausland, of the public safety department, said. Perdomo was reported missing by his wife Tonya. He has a . 10-year-old boy and two-year-old girl. Probe: Police named Daniel Porter (right) as a person of interest. It is believed he was the last person to see Perdomo, along with girlfriend Cheyanne Nowak (left) 'Never in a million years would I think . I'd be hanging up missing posters of my brother,' his sister Skye Ramos . told ABC News. 'How can you sleep?' On Monday, Mr Perdomo's wife, a teacher, spoke publicly about the disappearance. 'Danny lived there, but he’s with his girlfriend most of the time. He comes and goes' Joan Leino, Daniel Porter's neighbour in Jackson, Maine . She called her husband 'a dedicated dad. He helps people out a lot.' 'He was always doing something for somebody,' Tonya Perdomo said, adding: 'He had friends from all over so it wouldn't be unusual for him to go out of town.'

When it was all over, Matt Kenseth was the only sure thing, and it wasn't even close. Kenseth capped a crazy 36 hours for NASCAR by winning the first postponed Daytona 500 in 55 editions of the marquee event. He held off Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Roush Fenway Racing teammate Greg Biffle over a two-lap overtime finish in a race that was scheduled to begin Sunday afternoon but ended in the early morning hours Tuesday.

Blaze: Safety crews try to extinguish a fire from a jet dryer after it was hit by Juan Pablo Montoya during the Daytona 500 . Rescue: The driver of the jet dryer is helped down the track as leaking fuel bursts into flames after being hit by Juan Pablo Montoya . Everything that could go wrong with . this Daytona 500 did, and the first NASCAR race in primetime television . could be remembered for everything but the eventual winner. Journeyman . driver Dave Blaney was leading when a problem with Juan Pablo Montoya's . car sent him spinning under caution into a safety truck. The truck, which holds 200 gallons of jet kerosene, burst into flames. Montoya's car slid into the grass, and he gingerly climbed from it as fire trucks rushed to the scene. The inferno raged on, and NASCAR red-flagged the race with 40 laps remaining. Safe: Juan Pablo Montoya walks from his burning car after it collided with a track-drying truck during the NASCAR Daytona 500 auto race . NASCAR officials were examining the track surface to determine whether the race could continue. 'About the time you think you've seen about everything, you see something like this,' NASCAR president Mike Helton said. 'I . think we, like everybody else, would like to see this race finished. This is within reason, and we think we can do that within reason. 'We've waited this long. Another 30 minutes is worth trying to finish the 40 laps.' Jet fuel poured down the surface of Turn 3 at Daytona International Speedway after the accident, creating a fiery lasting image of NASCAR's biggest race of the year.

Battling the blaze: Safety workers try to extinguish a fire from a jet dryer after it was hit by Juan Pablo Montoya, grinding the Daytona 500 to a halt . The clean-up crews were using boxes of Tide laundry detergent to clean up the fuel. It . was par for the course for this Daytona 500, which was postponed for . the first time in NASCAR's 54-year history because of steady rain all . day Sunday at the track. NASCAR . initially planned to restart the race at noon Monday, but persistent . rain forced series officials to make an early decision to hold off until . 7pm. Fox stayed with its plans to broadcast the race, making it the first ever Daytona 500 shown in primetime and an opportunity to feature the elite Sprint Cup Series. What's the damage? Montoya's team looks over his wrecked car after he collided with a jet dryer truck during the Daytona 500 . Speaking out: Juan Pablo Montoya talks to reporters after the massive crash . Carl Edwards, who fell just short of . winning the title last season, started from the pole with champion Tony . Stewart, seeking to snap an 0-for-13 losing streak in the Daytona 500, . right behind him. Danica Patrick, making the full-time move to NASCAR from IndyCar, was making her Daytona 500 debut. Those storylines, however, were quickly forgotten in this bizarre 55th running of NASCAR's version of the Super Bowl. It took several minutes for safety workers to put out the fire, and then came the task of removing the truck from the track and cleaning up all that spilled fuel. Rinse, repeat: The clean-up crews were using boxes of Tide laundry detergent and a lot of water to clean up the fuel on the track at the Daytona International Speedway . Towing the truck from the steep . banking presented a challenge, as NASCAR was nervous any movement would . dig into the track surface. Montoya, who said his helmet was singed in the fire and his foot ached, said he felt a vibration in his car before the accident. 'I've . hit a lot of things - but a jet dryer?' he said. 'It just felt really . strange, and as I was talking on the radio, the car just turned right.' The drivers were allowed to exit their cars after about 10 minutes under the red flag. Earnhardt had been complaining he had to go to the bathroom, and Brad Keselowski was posting to his Twitter account from inside his car. Red-flagged: The race was halted with just 40 laps to go as firefighters battled the flames erupting from the jet dryer . Blaney did not initially get out of his . car, and Jamie McMurray, who outlasted nearly two hours of delays to fix . a pesky pothole during his 2010 victory, stopped at Blaney's window to . speak to the driver leading the biggest race of his career. As the red flag continued, the drivers began to congregate around Blaney, and he got out of his car. Blaney entered the race winless in 397 previous starts. The 48-year-old from Ohio won his only NASCAR race in 2006 in the second-tier Nationwide Series. And he came into Daytona having to race his way into the field after team owner Tommy Baldwin made a deal with Stewart to give Patrick the points she needed to guarantee her a spot in the Daytona 500. Trouble on the track: Danica Patrick (right), Kurt Busch (left), David Ragan (second from left) and Jimmie Johnson (second from right) crashed into each other shortly after the race began . Lined up behind Blaney was Landon Cassill, who was running for BK Racing, a team formed earlier this month when it purchased the assets and points from defunct Red Bull Racing, and Tony Raines, who raced his way into the Daytona 500 and picked up sponsorship from Republican Presidential candidate Rick Santorum. The racing was aggressive at the drop of the green flag, and the first accident occurred on just the second lap, when Elliott Sadler ran into the back of Jimmie Johnson as they drafted around the track. The contact sent Johnson into the wall, and as the five-time NASCAR champion slid back down across the track, he was hit hard in the door by David Ragan. The accident collected six cars total, including defending Daytona 500 winner Trevor Bayne and Patrick. 'I'm just really, really bummed to start the season this way,' Johnson said. 'To work as hard as everyone did at Hendrick Motorsports to get this Lowe's Chevrolet and to have it barely complete two-and-a-half miles of green flag racing is pretty sad. TV event: The race was the first-ever Daytona 500 shown in primetime and a golden opportunity to feature the elite Sprint Cup Series . We'll just go on and go to Phoenix and set our marks on winning that race.' He may go to Phoenix without any points: NASCAR is expected to penalize crew chief Chad Knaus this week for failing the first inspection of SpeedWeeks. Knaus could be facing both a suspension and a loss of a points. It took about an hour for Patrick's Stewart-Haas Racing crew to get her back on the track, and she returned 62 laps behind the leader. The race settled down after that, and the push for the $200,000 leader bonus at the halfway mark didn't spark too much excitement. Star-studded event: Attendees at this year's Daytona 500 included Glee star Jane Lynch and Sports Illustrated swimsuit cover girl Kate Upton . Bringing the noise: Rocker Lenny Kravitz also attended the event, bringing along a Daytona 500-themed Gibson guitar . Two-time NASCAR champion Terry Labonte had been running second and presumably in position to make a move for the cash, but he was spun by Marcos Ambrose. 'Awe, man! Who would turn the Ice Man around?' Earnhardt shouted on his team radio. After a brief caution, the leaders had a 10-lap sprint to the halfway point, and Martin Truex Jr used a big push from Denny Hamlin to slide by Greg Biffle on the deciding lap. Although he was told over his team radio to 'go get the other half,' history didn't bode well for Truex: the last leader at the halfway point to win the Daytona 500 was Davey Allison in 1992.

Three-year-old Hamish Hey was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer, which attacks muscle cells and affects just 50 children in the UK each year. A deadly tumour was detected above his left knee and following intensive chemotherapy he underwent an eight-hour operation to remove the mass. Road to recovery: Three-year-old Hamish Hey with his left foot and ankle reattached to his thigh back to front . Using a limb-sparing technique called rotationplasty, surgeons amputated his leg above the knee. They then rotated the ankle and foot and reattached it to the thigh, forming a knee joint. The procedure means that Hamish will not be confined to a wheelchair and will be able to walk again when a prosthetic limb is finally attached. Susan Hey, 33, who has spent months with her son at Glasgow’s Yorkhill Royal Hospital for Sick Children said he had been very brave. 'Hamish is the fourth child in the UK to . have this operation. Thumbs up! The limb-sparing technique called rotationplasty means Hamish will be able to walk when a prosthetic limb is finally attached . Susan Hey spent months at her son's bedside while he underwent treatment . 'He has astounded everyone . with his resilience, he’s absolutely amazing.' Hamish was in the bath with five-year-old sister Lily when his parents noticed a lump just above his knee. Initially they thought it was a bite . or an injury suffered as a result of a fall, but a GP advised them to go to Raigmore Hospital. Hamish was immediately referred to . Yorkhill and within a week of finding the lump, was diagnosed with . metastatic alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, a cancer which attacks muscle cells. It is so rare, it affects just 50 children in the UK each year. Hamish was started on a programme of intensive chemotherapy and almost died during the treatment. 'After the first few cycles he had a complication with his liver which started to shut down,' explained Mrs Hey, who has moved the family from their home in Osprey Crescent, Nairn, to Glasgow, so they can be closer to Hamish. 'The cancer was the most aggressive it could possibly be and we didn’t think he was going to make it, it’s amazing he’s still here.' The chemotherapy shrunk the tumour to the size of a lemon, meaning doctors could proceed with the operation. He is now recovering well although the cancer has spread to the lungs. 'He’s not out of the woods yet,' Mrs Hey added. “The surgery is a move in the right direction as the primary source of cancer is gone, but he still has some cancer in his lungs.' Hamish is due to undergo more chemotherapy and radiotherapy this year.","Hamish Hey diagnosed with rare form of cancer .

Pink Floyd star Roger Waters has entered the debate over the Falkland Islands, declaring that they ‘should be Argentinian’. In an interview with Chilean television, the 68-year-old said he was happy to say so as an Englishman because he was ashamed of Britain’s colonial past, ‘when we were out raping and plundering and stealing’. Asked about the rights of the residents to decide their future, he conceded: ‘The Falkland Islanders are British ... so they have a point of view.’ It comes after actor Sean Penn a fortnight ago accused Britain of ‘ludicrous and archaic colonialism’ over the islands. In recent weeks Argentina has increased its demands for sovereignty of the Falklands, which have been British territory since 1833. Waters was speaking during in an interview with Chilean state television TVN, to be screened on Thursday in South America, where the Falklands are known as Las Malvinas. Journalist Amaro Gomez-Pablos asked him: 'You’ve landed in South America in the middle of a diplomatic tug of war. Are the Falklands-Malvinas British or are they Argentinian?' Waters, who sang and played bass with Pink Floyd, replied: 'I think they should be Argentinian.' Contested: Roger Waters said the Falklands should be Argentinean just two weeks after Sean Penn accused Britain of 'ludicrous colonialism' Asked if he had no qualms about saying that as an Englishman, he said: 'By and large I am as ashamed as I could possibly be of our colonial past. 'I take no pride in the fact that for 150 years or so the sun never set on the British empire, and that we were out raping and plundering and stealing as much as we could from everybody all over the world. 'That kind of imperialism is not something that as an Englishman I am proud of.'

Nurses only realised what had happened when Jason Ketley stumbled down the corridor with the rodent hanging from his neck by its teeth. They dislodged the creature and killed it, but Mr Ketley was left with about 12 deep puncture wounds where he had been badly bitten on his shoulder and neck. Vulnerable: Jason Ketley, 42, was left with painful injuries after being bitten by the rodent more than a dozen times on his back and neck as he lay sedated in his hospital bed . Horrifying: Hospital staff only discovered what was happening when Mr Ketley, who has a mental age of two, was spotted stumbling around a corridor with the rat hanging from his neck by its teeth . When his parents called to check on him, . they were told that the 42-year-old, who has learning difficulties, . bipolar disorder and a mental age of two, had been bitten by a rat, . although the hospital now insists it was a field mouse. But his mother Patricia Boardman, 63, said: ‘As soon as I saw the bites I knew it had to have been a rat. ‘They were deep teeth puncture marks all over his shoulder. I couldn’t . believe that there were rats running free in an NHS hospital. It’s . absolutely disgusting. ‘He was heavily sedated when it happened, so God knows how long the rat was gnawing him. It must have been in his bed.’ Mr Ketley was attacked after going to bed for the night at a specialist . care unit at St Ebba’s hospital in Epsom, Surrey, on November 20 last . year. He was taken to Epsom General Hospital the following day to have . diphtheria, tetanus and polio vaccinations to protect him from disease. Mrs Boardman, who worked at a solicitor’s office before retiring, said: . ‘I couldn’t believe how bad it was when I saw him – there were cuts and . scabs all over his shoulder. ‘He was completely defenceless and someone should have been keeping an . eye on him because he has problems communicating and he suffers in . silence. ‘If I kept my son in the conditions they keep him in, I’d have social services round and they’d put me in prison.’ The mother-of-two, who lives in Bognor Regis, West Sussex, with Mr . Ketley’s stepfather Tom, 66, said she had made a formal complaint and . was now considering suing the hospital. One of the units on the St Ebba's Hospital site, in Epsom, Surrey . Claims: Hospital bosses have claimed the rat was in fact a field mouse, but Mrs Boardman was disgusted at hospital staff's 'outrageous' suggestion her son was attacked by a field mouse because of the size of the bite marks . Mrs Boardman added that she and her husband are trying to find a new NHS-run site to move her son to. She also said that the NHS trust had not yet responded to her complaint and was stalling for time. At one stage, it even wrote to her to say it would have to consult Mr Ketley before accessing his medical records. Mrs Boardman said that when she called the care unit, a member of staff . answered the phone and told her: ‘Something terrible has happened. ‘A rat bit Jason and he’s got marks on his shoulders.’ It was only when she phoned again later that the trust insisted it was a field mouse. Field mice are herbivores and live on a diet of seeds. It is rare to see . one and they are, on average, only a few centimetres long. Mrs Boardman . added: ‘I’m so worried about leaving him there now. ‘They’re supposed to look after him but they clearly can’t be bothered. ‘I haven’t slept well since it happened and the worst thing is I don’t . know how it’s affected Jason because he can’t tell me. The staff at the . hospital said it was long and had a long tail. ‘Now if that’s not a rat, I don’t know what is. ‘Jason wouldn’t have known what was happening as he was so drugged up. ‘Truth be told, it’s been a nightmare having him at this hospital. ‘They can’t work out what’s wrong with him and the drugs they give him . make him worse, not better. They won’t even let me pay to bring in a . private doctor to assess him and get a second opinion. I’m at my wits’ end.’ Jo Young, the director of nursing at the trust, said the incident was . ‘genuinely shocking’ and that she was taking the family’s concerns . ‘extremely seriously’.

Accusations: Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude has been accused of overseeing a 'ludicrous waste of taxpayers' money' The Cabinet minister in charge of slashing Whitehall waste has spent £8.5million doing up the headquarters of his own department. Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude was last night accused of overseeing a ‘ludicrous waste of taxpayers’ money’ after details of the lavish refurbishment emerged. Figures released by the Cabinet Office reveal the department – which is also used by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and his staff – has spent £8.5million overhauling its Grade 1-listed Whitehall HQ since the election in 2010. Officials last night claimed the refurbishment could save money in the long run as it would enable more civil servants to use the building. But the revelations are embarrassing for Mr Maude who boasted this month that he was making huge strides in cutting Government waste.Labour last night seized on the figures. Shadow Cabinet Office minister Jon Trickett said: ‘Only last week Francis Maude claimed to possess an “unwavering determination to keep eradicating waste in Whitehall”. ‘If this is so, why is he spending  millions refurbishing a single building owned by his department? Anger: PCS union boss Mark Serwotka, who is locked in a dispute with Mr Maude about reforms to public sector pensions, said 'people will wonder exactly what Francis Maude's priorities are' ‘This is more evidence of the vast gap between the Government’s rhetoric and the reality of its policies. ‘This Government is not serious about efficiency which would protect necessary frontline services. This is a ludicrous waste of taxpayers’ money.’ PCS union boss Mark Serwotka, who is locked in a dispute with Mr Maude about reforms to public- sector pensions, said: ‘With thousands of civil servants losing their jobs and many more under threat, people will wonder exactly what Francis Maude’s priorities are.’ Big spend: The department, which is also used by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and his staff, has spent £8.5million overhauling its Grade 1-listed Whitehall HQ since the election in 2010 . Some of the costs went towards making the building greener by installing insulation, light sensors and secondary glazing, as well as improving disabled access. Sources said providing accommodation for Nick Clegg and his staff did not add significantly to the bill. A Government insider accused Labour of ‘breathtaking hypocrisy’ over the issue, pointing out that the refurbishment had been planned by the last government. He denied ministers were enjoying ‘lavish’ accommodation as a result of the overhaul, describing the refurbishment as ‘modern but austere’. A Cabinet Office spokesman claimed the refurbishment would provide desk space for more civil servants, allowing the Government to release other buildings. He added: ‘Our plan to reduce the locations staff are based in will save the taxpayer at least £100million. ‘By investing money up front in modernising our historic office at 70 Whitehall, we can quickly start moving people out of other buildings and save money faster.’ Earlier this month Mr Maude boasted of cutting the Whitehall headcount to its lowest since the Second World War. But it emerged that many staff remain on the public payroll and have simply been transferred to quangos and other agencies.

The British-born wife of Syrian president Bashar Assad has made a rare public appearance during a referendum in the war-torn country. Looking glamorous in a dark grey coat and dress, Asma Assad shook hands and joked with supporters as she accompanied her husband into a voting booth. Despite the continuing bloodshed in Syria, the government yesterday held a vote on constitutional reforms, which Assad claims will lead to multi-party parliamentary elections. Tyrant's wife: Asma Assad and her husband Bashar at the ballot box . All smiles: Asma and Bashar Assad smiled for the cameras while casting a vote for constitutional reform . Mrs Assad, 36, a former  investment banker who grew  up in Acton, West London, has virtually disappeared from the public eye since the unrest broke out last March. Her previous appearance was in December, when she and her two children stood alongside Assad at a pro-regime rally. Unrest against anti-regime rebels continued this morning, prompting British Foreign Secretary . William Hague to call for more sanctions against Syria in the wake of . continuing 'appalling' violence. He urged EU foreign ministers meeting . in Brussels to extend current financial sanctions against members of . the Assad regime by freezing European-held assets of the Syrian Central . Bank. Mobbed: Syrian President Bashar Assad (centre) and wife Asma (left) are greeted by supporters as they arrive to vote for the referendum . High five: A grinning Bashar Assad greets supporters as he arrives at the referendum polling station . He joined the talks following Friday's Tunis meeting of the Friends of Syria group, where U.S. Secretary of State Hilary Clinton renewed attacks on the veto by Russia and China of a United Nations Security resolution condemning Syria. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton speaks during a press conference calling for the military to turn their backs on President Assad . The lack of a Security Council declaration has weakened international diplomatic efforts to end the violence. And Mr Hague warned today that the actions of Russia and China were seen as wrong 'in the eyes of the world'. He said the issue would be taken up once more at the UN in New York later this week. Meanwhile, the EU foreign ministers were trying to reinforce their economic measures against Syria, which already include an arms embargo, a ban on EU exports of oil and gas equipment to Syria, and visa and asset bans against more than 100 members of the ruling regime including President Assad. Today's expected freeze on assets of the Syrian central bank is intended to help limit funding the continuing violent crackdown on the regime's opposition. The EU foreign ministers will also endorse Friday's Tunis statement calling on the Syrian leader to step down and urging the setting up of a UN peacekeeping force. Mr Hague dismissed yesterday's Syrian 'referendum' as of no relevance to international efforts to impose a 'diplomatic and economic stranglehold on the Assad regime' to 'choke off support for its campaign of terror'. Battleground: An image grab taken from a video uploaded on YouTube shows smoke billowing from the Baba Amr neighbourhood in the flashpoint city of Homs .

Asma Assad, 36, (pictured) grew up in Acton, West London where she was known as 'Emma'. She . is the daughter of consultant cardiologist Fawaz Akhras and retired . diplomat Sahar Otri, both Sunni Muslims, who moved from Syria to London . in the Fifties so that her father, who is now based at the Cromwell . Hospital and in Harley Street, could get the best possible education and . medical training. Asma, . who holds dual citizenship, British and Syrian, was educated at a . Church of England school in Ealing before attending a private girls’ day . school - Queen’s College, Harley Street. From . Queen’s, where she achieved four A-levels, Asma went to King’s College .

Then he, too, . came to London to study ophthalmology, though he had to leave early to . return to Syria after his elder brother Basil, who had been the heir, . died in a car crash. Asma . started seeing him in secret, resigning from JP Morgan just a month . before the wedding without being able to explain the real reason. With . her father, she has set up several London-based charities such as the . Syria Heritage. Vogue . has described her as ‘the freshest and most magnetic of first ladies’ and has topped French Elle’s ‘most stylish woman in politics’ list. In Damascus, Bashar and Asma now live in a flat with plate-glass windows and their three boys go to a Montessori school. Asma . speaks four languages and her connections with France have led her to . persuade the Louvre to help her open Syrian cultural attractions. Mrs Clinton has also said Syrians in the military who still support President Bashar Assad should turn against him. Speaking at a news conference in Morocco yesterday she added: 'The longer you support the regime's campaign of violence against your brothers and sisters, the more it will stain your honour. 'If you refuse, however, to prop up the regime or take part in attacks on your fellow citizens, your countrymen and women will hail you as heroes.' The statement came as 45 . Syrian civilians and soldiers were killed yesterday in fighting over Syria's . future that coincided with the vote on a new constitution that could keep . President Bashar Assad in power until 2028. The Syrian Observatory for Human . Rights said a military bombardment of opposition districts in Homs, now . in its fourth week, had killed nine civilians, while rebel fighters had . killed four soldiers in clashes in the city. The British-based Observatory said . eight civilians and 10 members of the security forces were killed in . violence elsewhere in Syria, the scene of what has become an . increasingly militarised revolt against four decades of Assad family . rule. So far around 7,500 have died in her husband’s brutal crackdown. Waleed Fares, an activist in the . Khalidiyah district of Homs, said: 'What should we be voting for, . whether to die by bombardment or by bullets? 'This is the only choice we have. 'We have been trapped in our houses for 23 days. 'We cannot go out, except into some alleys. 'Markets, schools and government . buildings are closed, and there is very little movement on the streets . because of snipers.' Mr Fares also said the battered district of Babo Amro has had no food or water for three days. 'Homs in general has no electricity for 18 hours a day,' he added. With most foreign reporters barred from Syria or heavily restricted, witness reports are hard to verify. The outside world has been powerless . to restrain Assad's drive to crush the 11-month-old revolt, which has . the potential to slide into a sectarian conflict between Syria's Sunni . Muslim majority and the president's minority Alawite sect. Unwilling to intervene militarily and . unable to get the U.N. Security Council to act following Russian and . Chinese opposition, Western powers have imposed their own sanctions on . Syria and backed an Arab League call for Assad to step down. Time for action: Syrian President Bashar Assad has promised to push for a multi-party parliamentary election within three months . German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said the referendum was 'nothing but a farce.' 'Sham votes cannot contribute to a . solution of the crisis. Assad needs to put an end to the violence and . clear the way for a political transition,' he said in a . statement. In Hama, another city with a bloody . record of resistance to Baathist rule, one activist said nobody was . taking part in the referendum. 'We will not vote on a constitution drafted by our killer,' he said by satellite telephone, asking not to be named. This is Syria's third referendum . since Assad inherited power from his late father.  The first installed . him as president in 2000 with an official 97.29 per cent 'Yes' vote.  The second renewed his term seven years later with 97.62 per cent in favour.","Asma Assad makes rare appearance during referendum .

Police rescued two small boys from a squalid house after finding it filled with garbage, rotting food and a septic system had backed up into the bathtub, the toilet and the sink. Officers in Lilburn, Georgia, arrested the children's mother, Sky Mitsch, along with the father of one of the children, Stephen Hunt, both 22, on child cruelty charges. Both children are now in state custody. The boys, an infant and a 2-year-old, had no food in the house and there was no running water, authorities said. The toddler was covered in flea bites and his ears were impacted with wax. Conditions were so deplorable, police called animal control officers to remove the dog from the house because they feared for its safety. Scroll down for video . Squalor: The owner of this house called police when he saw the horrible mess that his tenants were keeping their two children in . Fetid water: The septic tank was full and had been backing up into the sink and shower drains in the home . 'They determined it was not even fit for the dog,' Lilburn Police Capt Ben Haynes told Mail Online. The owner of the house, Charles Reagin, was renting it to Mitsch and called police when he saw the deplorable conditions inside. Outside, the front yard was littered with garbage, broken beer bottles and diapers full of excrement. The back yard was a dump, filled with trash. Inside conditions were dramatically worse, Capt Haynes said. The water to the house has been shut off and the septic tank was overflowing. This caused sewage and waste waster to back up in the sinks, the toilet and the bathtub. The toilet could not flush, but the family seemed to be using it anyway. The bathtub, once pearly white, was ringed with black sludge. Arrested: Sky Mitsch, the children's mother, and her boyfriend, Stephen Hunt, both 22, face cruelty to children charges after police discovered the conditions . Mess: Police said the deplorable conditions inside the home were not even fit for animals, much less an infant and a toddler . In the kitchen sink, dishes soaked in fetid water with food scraps. The refrigerator was filthy and nearly empty -- brown sludge coated the bottom. The floor was so messy, it may as well have been dirt, the Capt Haynes said. Food sat out, rotting. Garbage, dirty clothes and diapers littered the rooms. Live ammunition and prescription drugs were discovered within reach of the children. When they found the two-year-old boy, his face was covered with flea bites. He was so badly in need of care that earwax was coming out his ears. 'It's very difficult to understand how you would let something like this get to this degree,' Haynes said. Mitsch and Hunt seemed largely un-phased by the horrifying squalor, Haynes said. No food: The refrigerator was almost completely empty and full of brown sludge . They told officers they knew the house was 'just a little dirty' and that they were in the process of cleaning up. The pair were arrested on the spot. The Department of Human Services took the toddler into custody and went to the grandmother's house to seize the infant, who was just seven months old. As officers left the house, one discovered a remnant of the horrid scene had stayed with him -- he found a flea crawling on his skin. Investigators are still trying to determine how and why the parents allowed their house to sink to such deplorable conditions, Haynes said. Officers found drug paraphernalia, but addiction to hard drugs does not appear to be the driving factor in the case, he said. 'I never let my kids live in something like this, never,' Reagin, the landlord, told WSBTV. Mitsch and her family members told the TV station that they were planning to move out of the house, anyway and are working to get her children back.","Toddler, 2, was covered in flea bites and his ears were impacted with wax .

"By . James Chapman . Last updated at 11:52 PM on 28th February 2012 . Shot dead by police: Jean Charles de Menezes was killed by police after mistakenly being identified as a suicide bomber. If the law was changed, details could be withheld from inquests like his . The historic principle that justice should be seen to be done is threatened by hugely controversial plans to allow secret hearings, ministers are being warned. Proposals for sweeping new powers which would allow the Government to withhold any evidence it deems ‘sensitive’ from an open civil court hearing or inquest are facing a chorus of criticism. Former director of public prosecutions Ken Macdonald yesterday attacked the Government’s proposal for so-called ‘closed material procedures’ in civil courts, an attempt to prevent sensitive claims for damages being aired in open hearings. Critics say the legislation has been ‘dictated’ by the security services following an embarrassing string of cases brought against them by former terrorist suspects who claimed they had been subjected to torture. In the case of Binyam Mohamed, a former Guantanamo Bay prisoner who sought to sue the Government for complicity in torture, the Government tried to conceal documents disclosing his alleged mistreatment but were overruled by the courts. There is increasing concern that Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke’s proposals will mean ministers being able to prevent a huge range of cases – from military inquests to police and medical negligence claims – being held in public. Negligence claims against the Ministry of Defence for death and injuries arising from ‘friendly fire’ incidents or failure of equipment would be a prime target for ministers seeking to avoid embarrassment, campaigners predict. Past cases such as the inquiry into the shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes by police who mistook him for a terrorist could have been hushed up by the Government if the measures had been in force at the time. And MI5’s failings over the 7/7 bombings might never have come to light. Shami Chakrabarti, director of civil rights campaign group Liberty, called the proposals a ‘shameless attempt to cover up abuses of power’. She said: ‘Proposed legislation wouldn’t . just end the long-held principle that no one is above the law – it would . exclude the Press, public and victims from seeing justice done. Concern: Kenneth Clarke was facing calls to drop the plans to drop plans to allow secret hearings . ‘Open courts and investigative journalists fought to uncover some of the worst scandals of the war on terror. Under these plans, future ministers would be granted sweeping powers to lock down embarrassing inquests and civil claims against the powerful. Victims of gross abuses of power, the public and the Press could be left in the dark for ever.’ Under the proposals, ministers will be able to order not only that a hearing is conducted behind closed doors, but also that claimants are denied access to government evidence or witnesses. The reforms, detailed in a Green Paper on justice and security, are backed by senior figures in the security community, notably Sir Malcolm Rifkind, chairman of the parliamentary intelligence and security committee. But legal experts in the field appear increasingly uneasy. Lord Macdonald, QC, said the plans would put the Government ‘above the law’ and must be reconsidered. ‘These unprecedented proposals are an audacious attack on the fundamental principle of British justice: that you should be able to know, and to challenge, the claims which are made against you,’ he said. ‘They threaten to put the Government above the law, while leaving ordinary citizens, and the Press, shut out of their own justice system. ‘After a decade in which we have seen our . politicians and officials caught up in the woeful abuses of the war on . terror, the last thing the Government should be seeking is to sweep all . of this under the carpet. However, that is exactly what their disastrous . secret justice proposals are likely to do. Questions and Answers . ‘We cannot afford to sleepwalk into a system of secret courts. David Cameron came to power saying “sunlight is the best disinfectant”. We should not sacrifice Britain’s open and transparent justice system simply to protect politicians and their officials from embarrassment.’ Concern is shared by significant numbers of ‘special advocates’, an elite group of barristers and solicitors who have special rights to deal with cases that involve evidence restricted due to national security concerns, the Daily Mail has learned. Though these are the lawyers who would administer the Government’s new system, 57 out of the 69 current special advocates have indicated they they do not agree with the plans. Helen Mountfield, QC, a serving special advocate, said: ‘Special advocates were never intended as a substitute for a fair trial and the inherent weaknesses of this system will leave a justice gap.’ The Prime Minister has said he is deeply worried by the ‘inability of the security services to defend themselves in civil cases because they cannot compromise national security by revealing sensitive information in open court’. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ‘We have a growing problem in this country where individuals are alleging Government wrongdoing but the courts do not have the tools they need to get to the bottom of the matter. ‘The reason for this is that the evidence on which the case rests is either intelligence material given to us by our allies – which we have promised not to reveal – or it is material which could reveal the identity of sources, or damage our ability to keep the public safe. ‘This means that the Government is unable to defend its actions if the material has to be given in open court. It means that the claimants are left without any clear judgments by a judge based on all the relevant information, and most importantly it leaves the public with no independent judgment by a court on very serious matters. ‘We are therefore consulting widely on our proposal to allow sensitive evidence in this small number of cases to be argued before a judge in a closed court with the safeguards needed to protect public safety.’","Friendly fire deaths, police shootings and medical negligence cases could all have information withheld from them .

Amanda Smith, 33, killed 3-year-old Jacob, . called 911 and then sprung out of a closet swinging an axe at a police . officer who  arrived at her home in Indianapolis. The Johnson County Sheriff's Department received two 911 calls shortly after 9 p.m., one from Smith stating that her son was dead and another from Smith's mother, 'advising that her daughter told her that she had done something to her child that could not be undone.' Scroll down for video . Drowned: Jacob Smith was being fought over by his parents in a custody battle. Accused: Amanda Smith is believed to have drowned her son . Amanda . Smith and Robert Crim were in the middle of a custody battle over their . son and a court hearing was set for March 14 to determine whether Jacob . would continue to live with his maternal grandmother, as Amanda Smith . wanted, or to live with his father. Jacob, . who would have celebrated his 4th birthday on March 7, had been living . with his grandmother, Wanda Smith, since August 2010 after child welfare . workers intervened because of the parents' drug problems. However, late last year Mr Crim indicated he had overcome his drug problems and wanted to gain custody of his son. Mr . Crim, who was no longer in a relationship with Jacob’s mother, filed . documents seeking to terminate Wanda Smith's guardianship. Johnson County judge, Mark Loyd, had . warned Amanda Smith last Thursday that her say in her son's custody . hinged on better cooperation with authorities. Custody battle: A court hearing was set for March 14, a week after Jacob's 4th birthday, to determine whether Robert Crim would gain custody of his son . Although Wanda Smith had been granted custody of the boy, Amanda Smith was allowed one night a week unsupervised visits. Crim, who was in a six-year relationship with Amanda Smith, said Smith suffered from schizophrenia and is blaming the court system for his son’s death. He said Smith had become angry in recent months after losing custody of her two other children and because he had filed for custody of Jacob. ""She stated in the letter to the court that she'd do anything to keep him away from me, and the court blindly ignored that,"" he said. ""She told me that she hears voices and sometimes she acted on them,"" Crim told RTV6. Crime scene: Amanda Smith drowned her son at her apartment (pictured), had a history of drug problems and had called police 11 times over the previous weekend . Despite Smith's long history of problems, Loyd said, he had never heard anything that would indicate she was prone to anger or violence. ""The child is still in a case in my court,"" the judge said, ""and under those circumstances I feel terribly responsible."" As well as her drug problems, Smith was known to authorities for her frequent calls to 911. She had called 911 more than 200 times over the past few years, including 11 the past weekend, police said. She now faces a preliminary murder charge and a charge of attempted murder for rushing at a Trafalgar police officer with an axe. Smith pleaded guilty to felony child neglect in December 2009 after a police officer went to her home and found that she and Crim, 42, Bargersville, had been smoking crack all night while caring for Jacob, then a year old.

A 340-ton boulder - due to go on display as a modern art exhibit - has begun a painstaking 105 mile journey from the spot it was found to the museum where it will be housed. The enormous chunk of granite, will take 11 nights to travel between a quarry in Riverside, California, and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art on Wilshire Boulevarde's Miracle Mile. Mounted onto a giant transporter 200 feet long and three lanes wide, the rock will crawl along at around eight miles an hour making its way through four counties and 22 cities. Scroll down for video . Arthouse rock: The 340-ton boulder that 'earth artist' Michael Heizer has chosen to exhibit at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art must be moved 105 miles from a quarry in Riverside . Off we go: Mounted on a 60 axle trailer three lanes wide, the enormous artwork begins its 11 night trip to the museum . Send off: Dozens of well-wishers were on hand to bid farewell to the rock and the quarry even hosted a barbecue on for museum staff and others involved with the mammoth project . Route: The boulder, which will be transported at night and during the . early hours, cannot be taken on the freeway as it is too heavy for the . bridges . The notoriously reclusive artist Michael Heizer had reportedly been searching for the perfect boulder for over 40 years. When he came across the huge specimen in 2007 he said simply: 'That's the one'. The piece entitled Levitated Mass will be placed over a 456-foot-long trench on the Museum's north side. Visitors will be able to walk underneath it where it will appear to be floating in the air above them. Emmert International, which specializes in moving extremely large or sensitive objects, like nuclear generators and missiles, have taken charge of the tricky operation which will end on March 10. Seach: The notoriously reclusive artist Michael Heizer had reportedly been looking for the perfect specimen for over 40 years . Logistics: To make way for the enormous vehicle, traffic signals will have to be disassembled and power lines cut before everything is reassembled in time for the morning rush hour . Workers lift power lines to make way for the custom built trailer which is three lanes wide and longer than a football field . Due to the scale of the operation it can only be moved during the night and early hours and the most direct route via the Pomona and Santa Monica freeways is out of the question as the bridges cannot bear the weight. To clear the way, traffic signals will have to be disassembled and power lines cut before everything is reassembled in time for the morning rush hour. Dozens of people were on hand to bid farewell to the rock and the quarry even hosted a barbecue on Tuesday night for museum staff and others involved with the move. Steady: A crane lowers a supporting brace into the frame. The total cost of the operation is estimated to be somewhere between $5million and $10million . Operation: An engineering team, which normally specialises in transporting large objects like nuclear generators or missiles, constructs a frame around the boulder which will become part of the trailer . The trailer, equipped with 44 axles, . built to hold at least a million pounds and powered by 650-horsepower . engines in the front and back, will be accompanied by as many as 60 . people who will clear a path for the rock and make sure it doesn't smash . into anything going around turns. Attraction: The rock will be placed on the north side of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art . It will travel no faster than 5 to 8 miles per hour and only late at night and in the early morning. The trip is expected to take 11 days, with the rock scheduled to roll up to the museum's back door sometime before dawn on March 10. The curious can follow the rock's progress on Twitter or through the museum's website and blog. Museum spokesman Miranda Carroll said: 'We're going to keep everybody updated as to where it's parked each day'. Many were wary, especially given that officials say it is likely the largest rock to be moved from Point A to Point B since the days when the ancient Egyptians were building the pyramids. The museum finally worked out a route that went around freeway overpasses, stayed away from bridges and avoided narrow streets to enough of a degree that everybody was satisfied. The total project is costing $5 million to $10 million. Museum director Michael Govan noted recently: 'It's funny, the Egyptians didn't have rubber wheels and diesel trucks to move things. But they also didn't have 22 cities through which they had to move their stones. 'And in California,' he added, ""everybody has a say. The Chinese company Hanjin Shipping Co. is covering much of the cost of the trip. Private donors also helped fund the artwork.","Enormous 40-ton chunk of granite will take 11 nights to travel 105 miles .

Body found: Jerry Perdomo, 31, (pictured left) of Orange City, Florida, was last seen at a rural home in Jackson, Maine, on February 16. Daniel Porter (right) was charged with the murder yesterday . The body was found in the wooded area of Newburgh, Maine earlier today after extensive searches for the missing man by authorities, his family and colleagues in the fire department. Mr Perdomo was found at 9.30 am by a Maine game warden and his dog about a half-mile from the Monroe town line. A team of 35 searchers began looking in that area at 8 am. The body had been concealed and police were now awaiting the findings of the medical examiner. The land where the body was found is believed to be owned by relatives of Daniel Porter.

Now Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu, 43, is fighting allegations he dated a 17-year-old male student while he was head of the now-closed DeSisto School in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, a decade ago. The boarding school used controversial discipline methods such as ‘sheeting’, which forced students to remove their clothes and wear only a sheet, according to former students and state records. Battle: Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu, 43, is fighting allegations that he dated a 17-year-old male student . Sheriff Babeu was headmaster from 1999 . to 2001 at a time when the school for troubled teenagers was probed by . state childcare officials for repeated abuse allegations, reported ABC . affiliate KNXV. Former student Holli Nielsen said the . school was ‘cult-like’ and she had to spend her 16th birthday wearing . nothing but a sheet. State documents also alleged students ‘strip . searched’ each other. They also ‘routinely took group . showers’ leading to sexual abuse, the documents said.

Serious accusations: Babeu, pictured with Senator . John McCain in 2010, admitted that he was gay this month . Although eight former students claim . Sheriff Babeu had a relationship with the student, both men deny any . inappropriate or sexual bond at the school. But the student said they . remained friends. At 17 the boy was within the state . legal age of consent. A spokesman for Sheriff Babeu said he was never . targeted by any probe or lawsuit and was known for restoring the . school’s financial stability. ‘Sheriff Babeu never had a sexual . relationship with a student,’ he told the Los Angeles Times. ‘A student . has never lived with Sheriff Babeu.’ The sheriff was not involved in discipline issues, he said.

"By . Emily Allen . Last updated at 12:10 AM on 28th February 2012 . Charlotte Church and her parents settled her phone-hacking damages action for £600,000 at the High Court . Singer Charlotte Church yesterday said she . was 'sickened and disgusted' by the News of the World's phone hacking which directly led to 33 articles appearing in the newspaper about her and her family. The 26-year-old was at London's High Court to accept £600,0000 damages from News Group Newspapers (NGN) which owns the now defunct tabloid. Lawyers said the stories included an article published about her father having an affair and taking cocaine which they published despite the paper knowing that her mother had just attempted suicide. The singer said money 'could never mend' the damage that was . done but she planned to put the payout towards protecting herself and her children from further . invasions of their privacy. In a statement outside the Royal Courts . of Justice, Miss Church said: 'What I have discovered as the litigation has gone on has sickened and disgusted me. 'Nothing was deemed off limits by those who pursued me and my family, just to make money for a multinational news corporation.' She added: 'In my opinion, they are not truly sorry, only sorry they got caught.' The settlement includes £300,000 in legal costs and a public apology and follows months of legal wrangling. In November, the Leveson Inquiry heard that Miss Church’s mother tried to . commit suicide shortly before the News of the World published a story . about her partner having an affair and taking cocaine. The front page story ran in December 2005 under the headline 'Church three in a bed cocaine shock'. Phones . belonging to the Miss Church family were hacked and staff knew about her . mother’s suicide attempt but published the story anyway, lawyers said. The newspaper then made a ‘Faustian . pact’ with the singer's mother that they would not publish lurid . follow-up story about her husband’s affair if she did an exclusive . interview. The inquiry also heard Miss Church claim she waived a £100,000 fee to sing at Rupert Murdoch’s wedding to Wendi Deng in 1999 in return for favourable coverage in his newspapers. News International denied an offer was made. In a statement outside the Royal Courts of Justice, Church said money 'could never mend' the damage that was done to her and her family but she planned to put the payout towards protecting her privacy . However, the singer said she was betrayed by the media tycoon, whose . publications she claims have attacked her throughout her career. In addition, she said her overnight success as the ‘Voice of an Angel’ when she was just 11 had warped her childhood and meant she was hunted by paparazzi for years, with newspapers determined to portray her as a ‘fallen angel’. Miss Church said yesterday that her parents had suffered as much as she had in their treatment by the company. Private detective Glenn Mulcaire, left, and Charlotte Church, right, speaking at the Leveson Inquiry in November . 'Whatever I have had to go through, they have suffered as well. They . have been harassed, put under surveillance, and my mother was bullied . into revealing her own private medical condition for no other reason . than they were my parents. 'Someone in a newspaper thought that was OK. How can that be, in any right-thinking society?' Charlotte Church sang at Rupert Murdoch's wedding in 1999 when she was 13 . She said she was 'happy' with the result in one sense, but added that . she had discovered that, despite an apology, 'these people were prepared . to go to any lengths to prevent me exposing their behaviour', including . forcing her mother to relive the 'enormous personal distress' she had . been caused in 2005. 'It seems they have learned nothing, and I would have learned nothing . more from an actual trial since it was clear that no-one from News . International was prepared to take the stand to explain their actions,' she said. It comes as it emerged the phone-hacking scandal could deepen and spread to the U.S. after claims Mr Mulcaire had American telephone numbers in his notes. It . has been claimed he had the numbers of Miss Church’s Los . Angeles agent and New York publicist among thousands of pages of notes . seized by Scotland Yard detectives. News International has declined to comment on the latest allegations. Miss Church added: 'I would also like to make it clear that we were never in . this for the money. Money could never mend the damage that was done. 'I intend to dedicate my portion of the settlement to protecting myself and my children from further invasions of our privacy.' As Rupert Murdoch's news empire is under huge strain again following a barrage of new allegations, the media tycoon took to Twitter to pat himself on the back for his latest venture. Twenty four hours after the Sun on Sunday hit the streets, replacing the now defunct News of the World, Mr Murdoch tweeted: 'Amazing! The Sun confirmed sale of 3.260,000 copies yesterday. Thanks all readers and advertisers. Sorry if sold out - more next time.' The bullish tweet came just hours after the triple blow of: Church accepting £600,000 damages over phone hacking; the police chief leading the phone hacking investigation, saying there was a 'culture of illegal payments' at The Sun; and revelations that Rebekah Brooks knew that there were up to 110 victims of phone hacking at the News of the World as far back at 2006. The Church family solicitor Mike Brookes told Mr Justice Vos that the newspaper had 'repeatedly targeted' Miss Church and her voicemail messages 'and in doing so unlawfully . obtained her private medical information and details of her personal . relationships with her family and friends.' Michael . Silverleaf QC, for NGN, said: 'I am here today to offer my client's . sincere apologies to the Church family for the way they have been . treated. 'NGN acknowledges . that they should never have had to endure what they have suffered and . that NGN are liable for the damage that they have caused.' Miss Church . settled a lawsuit against News International on February 23. Mulcaire was jailed in 2007 for illegally accessing mobile-phone messages. The phone-hacking scandal has led to a series of large pay-outs, as well as the News of the World’s closure. In . total, more than 50 phone hacking cases have been settled, with the . majority of victims receiving between £25,000 and £30,000. Among the bigger payments, the family of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler are said to have received £3million. Such deals mean the £20million fund put aside by News Group Newspapers for settlements may need to be topped up.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 1:18 PM on 24th February 2012 . A young boy must survive on a simple diet of chicken and chips and fruit salad, after he was diagnosed with a rare allergic condition. Six-year-old Jayden Clarke baffled doctors and consultants with a series of mysterious health problems, which left his parents Rob and Nicky constantly frustrated and disappointed by the lack of a diagnosis. His stomach was often swollen, his skin dry and he has suffered bleeding from his bowel and constipation. Limiting: Jayden Clarke, 6, with some of the few foods he can actually eat . He collapsed because of breathing difficulties and at times his skin was so dry it looked like he had been slashed by a knife and was so painful he would wake up ten times a night. After years of tests, experts at Great Ormond Street have now made a breakthrough. Following a series of biopsies, they have diagnosed Jayden with the rare condition, Eosinophillic Gastrointestinal Disease (EGID). The condition affects just 700 people in the UK. The condition, when high levels of white blood cells involved in allergic reactions are present in the body, restricts Jayden’s diet to just nine foods - cereal, chicken, ham, pears, apples, bananas, carrots, potatoes and rice. If he eats something different, his stomach will swell and his skin will become so dry it will crack and bleed. Jayden of Wootton, Isle of Wight also has analyphatic asthma, triggered by the condition, and has to take medication and have cream rubbed into his skin every day. Baffled: Jayden with his parents Rob and Nicky Clarke, who are relieved they finally have a diagnosis . Last June doctors restricted him to a no food diet, with just special baby milk, Neocate, for 21 days. Nicky said: 'It was a horrendous time. We caught him trying to lick crumbs off the table, he was so hungry. 'Explaining to him we were only trying to make him better was so difficult. 'There were lots of tears and he kept telling us we could not starve him because he was only a five-year-old boy.' As a baby, Jayden was very agitated and he could not have normal baby milk and much of his life has been spent in hospital. Jayden’s health has put a huge strain on Rob, 49, and Nicky, 43, and the couple have given up careers in the police and the NHS to care for him, as he needs lots of time off school. Nicky, who has formed a support group to help other parents of children with severe food allergies, said: “It has been very difficult. 'Rob would say there was nothing wrong and I wondered if I was being an over anxious parent but my overwhelming feeling was there was more to it - I knew Jayden’s health problems were not normal.' Jayden also has analyphatic asthma . Although the diagnosis has given the family some direction, it has created other problems for Jayden. Nicky said Jayden was already fed up with his restricted diet and chips were one of the only things he was happy to eat. 'There are some things he won’t eat because he is so fed with them, like chicken and rice. 'I deliberately keep certain foods out of the house to avoid tempting. 'Jayden but it’s very hard on him, especially when he has to sit and watch his friends have their lunch at school, when he can only eat certain things.' Nicky said the family was very . conscious about eating around Jayden and her 13-year-old son, Ross, has . to eat sweets and chocolate in his bedroom, out of Jayden’s sight. Although . Rob and Nicky hope to introduce more foods into Jayden’s diet, it is . likely he will have to stay on his present diet forever, unless a cure . is found. Nicky, a . former nursing auxiliary on cardiac investigations at St Mary’s . Hospital, Newport, is in regular contact with consultants at Great . Ormond Street, which is at the forefront of EGID research. She takes Jayden to the asthma and allergy department at St Mary’s and he is advised by dietician, Carina Ventors. Rob, . who was a police officer for 15 years but now runs two businesses from . home, Rob Clarke Photography and children’s party specialists, . Cinderockers, said: 'He is an active, excitable, loving and humorous . five year old. 'It’s heart rending when you see him go to eat something he shouldn’t, then bring it back and ask us if it will make him poorly. 'It is getting harder as he gets older.'","Jayden can only eat nine foods: cereal, chicken, ham, pears, apples, bananas, carrots, potatoes and rice .

The 31-year-old clerical assistant and . her son were found dead in their Edinburgh home on Tuesday afternoon by . Barry Stephen, whom she married last November. Tragedy: Michelle Stephen and her son Leon were found dead in the Parkhead Grove area of Edinburgh . 'You are with the angels': Flowers left at the scene where the bodies of Mrs Weston and her child were found . A police insider said it appeared that Leon had been suffocated. Mrs Stephen, who would have celebrated her 32nd birthday on March 11, had killed herself using the same method. According to the source, she had . called Leon’s school in the Sighthill area of the city earlier in the . day to say he would not be coming in. Locals said Mrs Stephen had been struggling to cope following the recent death of her father, Jim Weir. The 57-year-old prison officer died of . cancer late last year and it is understood his daughter brought her . wedding forward so that he could attend. Today, Mr Stephen was being comforted . at his parents’ home nearby. Mr Stephen answered the intercom at the . block of flats to say: ‘I really don’t want to talk about what’s . happened.’ His mother, Sharon, then came to the . door of their flat to say: ‘Barry is devastated and I am devastated - we . really don’t want to talk about it.’ Inquiries: Police cordoned off the cul-de-sac in the rundown Sighthill suburb . Born Michelle Weir, she married Kevin Weston - Leon’s father - in 2004. The couple divorced in 2009 and Mr Weston, who now lives in Dalkeith, Midlothian, also declined to speak to the press today. Mrs Stephen married again at the upmarket, £230-a-night Braid Hill Hotel in the city’s Morningside district. It is understood she worked at St Augustine’s RC High School in the city. Chief Insp Richard Thomas of Lothian and Borders Police spoke to journalists at the scene. He said: ‘At around 5 o’clock last night, a treble 9 call was received at this address. ‘Police attended quickly to the scene and found two bodies, that of a 31-year-old woman and a five-year-old boy. ‘It is a very tragic set of circumstances and it is very early in the investigation process. ‘There is a police presence in the area to reassure residents. 'There is an inquiry team at Leith carrying out inquiries.’ Ch Insp Thomas said officers were ‘not in a position to confirm who lived with the woman’. He added: ‘Post mortems will be carried out and we will notify next of kin. ‘The deaths are being treated as unexplained. ‘We can confirm that the bodies were found within the house. The times of death cannot be confirmed at this early stage.’ Last night, police cordoned off the . cul-de-sac in the rundown Sighthill suburb in the west of the city and . friends and family left tributes by the house. Shocking: Mrs Weston and her child were discovered inside their home . Mrs Stephen bought the home in Parkhead Grove last year but was brought up in the area. She had recently married. It is believed she was left grief-stricken after the death of her father, Jim Weir, last month. He had been a well-respected prison officer and was very close to his daughter. An Edinburgh City Council spokesman said: ‘We are aware of the police investigation and will provide all the assistance we can.’ The skyline of Sighthill was dominated for decades by high rise tower blocks. The suburb is earmarked for regeneration.

Terrifying: Motorcyclist Peter Clarke (ahead in the distance) reached a top speed of 156mph. Here the police motorcycle rider pursues him at 154mph . Clarke escaped a jail sentence but was banned from the roads after a jury at Peterborough Crown Court found him guilty of dangerous driving. The court heard the defendant failed to spot the police motorcycle following him on the northbound triple-lane carriageway in Alconbury, Cambridgshire. He told the court he was in total control of his motorcycle at all times and that it was built for speed. However, he was eventually flagged down and stopped near Sawtry. Sentencing him, Miss Recorder McAllister  said his actions constituted 'reckless driving threatening others'.

'Our priority is to keep all road users safe and prevent deaths and serious injuries, clearly someone travelling at more than twice the legal speed limit puts not only themselves, but also other motorists, at grave risk of harm. 'Speed limits are set for a reason and any momentary lapse in concentration or sudden movement by this motorcyclist or other motorists travelling on that stretch of road could easily resulted in someone being killed.

One of the teenage boys who pushed a . shopping cart onto a woman from a four-story overpass  has been . sentenced to spend six to 18 months in a suburban group home. Jeovanni Rosario, 13, and his friend . Raymond Hernandez, 12, were caught after having pushed a shopping cart . off a Target parking overpass, hitting and sending philanthropist Marion . Hedges, 47, into a coma while she was out shopping for Halloween candy . to give underprivileged children. Tuesday's ruling will send Jeovanni to . a treatment program that deals with behavioral issues in the Manhattan . suburb of Westchester. He will be required to spend at least . six months in the Graham Windham facility and if he improves then he . will be free to return home. 'Your behavior from time to time is . completely out of control, but that doesn't mean it has to be that way . forever and ever,' Judge Susan Larabee said in the ruling. Investigation: Police seal off the crime scene and Target shopping cart which struck Mrs Hedges at Harlem Mall on October 30 . 'I want you to settle down in school . so when you do go home it will be a smooth transition. You can go on to . high school and not have to come back to see me,' she continued. The damage that the boys did to Mrs . Hedges is going to last much longer than his short sentence, however, as . she still struggles to complete everyday tasks and has had to relearn . her own name. It has also just emerged that Marion . Hedges, 47, technically 'died at the scene' after the heavy plastic cart . crushed her as she shopped for Halloween candy for poor children at a . mall with her son. The mother-of-two was brought back to life by a doctor who happened to be passing who carried out first aid on her. 'She actually died in the parking lot. There was no pulse, and she wasn’t breathing. The doctor brought her . back to life with CPR,' a law-enforcement source told the Post.

The prank has left Mrs Hedges unable . to take part in the charitable events she has devoted herself to over . the years, however she has said she forgives those responsible. The source told the Post: 'She's not the same person. Talking to her is like talking to a nine-year-old or a 90-year-old. 'She gets emotional and forgets things quickly.

"By . Hannah Roberts . Last updated at 4:36 PM on 17th February 2012 . An inconsolable mother has told of her heartbreak after an American soldier died before a helicopter could get him to hospital in Afghanistan. It took a medical evacuation team 59 minutes to get U.S. Army Specialist Chazray Clark to a hospital, after receiving a call that a roadside bombing had severed three of his limbs. The rescue helicopter was unable to swoop in for the pickup until another armed chopper arrived to provide cover. Scroll down for video . Fallen hero: Specialist Chazray Clark was killed by injuries from a roadside bomb in Afghanistan . Clark’s death last September has spurred debate about whether the medevac should have been equipped with firepower and left his mother facing painful questions. 'He was alive, he was conscious and now I have the question of if they have got to him in less time would he be here?', Keyko Davis-Clark said. ‘It has devastated us all that this young man who happens to be my son was alive and conscious. Everybody was solely on he was going to make it.' The rescue of the 1st Heavy Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division soldier, filmed by an embedded journalist Michael Yon, during which the soldier is writhing in pain, shows war at its most agonising. After the explosion, Clark's fellow soldiers applied tourniquets to stop his bleeding. They were hopeful that he might survive even though both of his legs and most of his left arm were severed in the blast. 'I need something, please. It hurts,' Clark, a 24-year-old combat engineer from Detroit, can be heard saying on the tape. The pre-dawn pickup zone in the Zhari . district of Kandahar province was considered 'hot,' meaning the medevac . could not swoop in for the pickup until another chopper with firepower . arrived to provide cover. Heavy burden: Mother Keyko Davis-Clark said the entire family is devastated by her son's death . Heartbreak: Wife Christina and her nine-year old son, Clark's stepson have to live with the knowledge that Chazray may have lived if he'd got to hospital faster . Family man: The helicopter carrying specialist Chazray Clark was delayed as it was forced to wait for an armed escort , leaving his family with unanswered questions . Heartfelt grief: Chazray left behind his wife Christina and her son, pictured, as well as a sister and three brothers and his mother and father . There was a delay but after . concluding that no armed escort helicopters already in the air could be . dispatched to the rescue, the Army summoned an armed Apache AH-64 . helicopter, parked at Kandahar Air Field, to the scene along with the . medevac. The medevac crew loaded Clark aboard in two minutes and whisked . him to the hospital. The . Army's goal is to get the most critically injured troops, or Category A . patients, to a medical facility within 60 minutes. Clark reached the hospital one minute . within the goal. Last year 167 Category A missions took longer than 60 . minutes, nine of them because the medevac was waiting for an air weapons . team, the army said. None of these delays affected the outcome for the patient, . according to the Army. Helicopters fly in pairs in . Afghanistan. If both were armed, critics point out,  wouldn't be needed . and both could evacuate patients from the battlefield. Ms. Clark is convinced that her son, who leaves a wife and stepson, would still be alive had he gotten there sooner. She . said: 'I feel like they should be armed. They're in war. Why aren't . they armed? These young men and women are risking their lives,' 'He might be an amputee with three prosthetic limbs, but he would be here.' Mission: The Army's goal is to get the most critically injured troops, or Category A patients, to a medical facility within 60 minutes . Rescue operation: The Army's goal is to get the most critically injured troops, or Category A patients, to a medical facility within 60 minutes . Saving lives: Medivac helicopters are currently unarmed and need to be escorted when in 'hot' areas . Among her questions: If the landing zone was in such a hot zone, why wasn't there already an armed helicopter providing air support for the soldiers on the ground? 'On the video, it didn't seem like there was fighting going on,' she said. Pilots, crew and medics who fly Afghanistan in 78 medevacs have a sole mission of recovering the wounded. Add guns to their helicopters and they would become a fighting aircraft too, says the Army, which reviewed the issue in 2008 and decided to keep the medevacs unarmed. The Army says armed escorts are mandatory for hot pickup zones. The requirement for an armed escort when militants are merely in the area is based on a risk assessment by aviation commanders and troops on the ground. Army officials say that waiting for . an escort is rare, and that installing machine guns, ammunition and . soldiers to man them would add roughly 600 pounds to a medevac chopper. That extra weight would limit its ability to fly in some high-altitude . areas of Afghanistan and reduce the number of patients who could be . evacuated at a time. 'They . try to lighten the aircraft as much as they can. They take seats out. They do all kinds of stuff,' said Maj. Gen. Richard Thomas, surgeon . general of U.S. forces in Afghanistan. 'Weight is their enemy. They need . to get lift and you need to get speed.' Unlike . the Army medevacs, which are emblazoned with red crosses, the Air . Force, Special Operations Command and the British fly search-and-rescue . and medevac missions with armed aircraft. They do not have red crosses, . which can be displayed only on unarmed aircraft, according to the Geneva . Conventions. Action: About 20 U.S. lawmakers have written to military officials inquiring about Clark's death . Weight gain: Army officials say that waiting for an escort is rare, and that installing machine guns, ammunition and soldiers to man them would add roughly 600 pounds to a medevac chopper . U.S. military officials also say that door guns can't match the precision firepower unleashed by Apache helicopters, which often escort medevacs. Limiting collateral damage is critical in Afghanistan where the death of civilians and destruction of property has put the U.S.-led coalition force at odds with the Afghan people. 'I just don't see the precision fire capability that this fight really requires, especially when you've got aircraft around that are specifically designed with Hellfire missiles, .30mm cannons with laser range finding,' said Col. T.J. Jamison of Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, who commands the 82nd Combat Aviation Brigade based at Bagram. 'You're not going to get that out of any door gun on the side of an aircraft.' Critics of the policy, including Yon, say the Army's arguments for keeping medevacs unarmed are flawed. A medevac helicopter pilot flying in Afghanistan, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he feared repercussions from his superiors, challenged the Army's belief that weighing down medevacs with guns would result in fewer wounded troops being evacuated. The issue is not how many patients can fit in a helicopter, but how many patients the single medic aboard can treat at a time — and that is one, the pilot said. He said waiting a long time for an escort is not common — but one time is one too many. In Clark's case, had the medevac been armed, it could have had Clark airborne and flying to a hospital within 12 minutes of his unit calling for a medevac, Yon said. Also, armed HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopters equipped with door guns that were parked in Kandahar at the time could have picked up Clark and delivered him to a hospital in fewer than 35 minutes, he said. These helicopters often assist with medevac missions, but their primary mission is for personnel rescue and recovery. About 20 U.S. lawmakers have written to military officials inquiring Clark's death. In a February 7 letter to a lawmaker, U.S. Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the U.S. Central Command, which oversees Afghanistan, would be directed to review guidelines on the use of escort aircraft. The Army boasts that a service member wounded in Afghanistan currently stands a 92 percent chance of surviving — the best rate of any war.Clark was among the 8 percent who didn't. Watch the video .

"By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 2:02 PM on 1st March 2012 . Baptised: Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, 38, was captured and killed by terrorists in Karachi . The unfurling scandal of Mormons posthumously baptising Jews took another turn for the worse today as it was revealed the same was done to a famous U.S. reporter murdered in Pakistan. Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, 38, was captured and killed by terrorists in Karachi months after 9/11 in February 2002 while he was probing links between Al Qaeda and Pakistan. Now it has been revealed the Jewish journalist was baptised by proxy in June 2011 at a Mormon temple in Twin Falls, Idaho, in a practice that has already been causing outrage among Jews. His wife Marine, who was pregnant with their son Adam when her husband died, said he would ‘laugh because it’s a silly’ and told the Boston Globe that the whole thing is ‘a bit surreal’. ‘We appreciate your good intentions but rest assured Danny’s soul was redeemed through the life that he lived and the values that he upheld,’ his parents Judea and Ruth Pearl told the Mormon Church, speaking to Boston Globe. ‘He lived as a proud Jew, died as a proud Jew, and is currently facing his creator as a Jew, blessed, accepted and redeemed,’ they added, saying the news of his baptism was ‘disturbing’. The finding was made by Helen Radkey, an ex-Mormon who is rising to fame by going through Church databases to spot posthumous baptisms of Jews - especially Holocaust survivors. The controversy last week caught the eye . of Catholic comedian Stephen Colbert, who gave his own take on it by . ‘converting all dead Mormons to Judaism’ using a hot dog sausage and a . cigar cutter. Survivors: Relatives of Elie Wiesel, left, and Simon Wiesenthal, right, have been posthumously baptised . That came after it was revealed earlier this month that Anne Frank, who died during the Holocaust in 1945 at Bergen-Belsen in Germany, was baptised by a Mormon for the tenth time in 23 years. Meanwhile Holocaust survivor and 83-year-old author Elie Wiesel recently learned several of his relatives who died under the Nazis were posthumously baptised by Mormons. The Church is coming under more scrutiny thanks to Broadway show The Book of Mormon and the presidential campaign of Mitt Romney, who allegedly once helped baptise an atheist relative. Anne was posthumously baptised by a . Mormon at a Dominican Republic temple for the first time in 13 years. The same was done to the parents of late Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal earlier . this month. Furore: It was revealed earlier this month that Anne Frank, who died during the Holocaust in 1945 at Bergen-Belsen in Germany, was baptised by a Mormon for the tenth time in 23 years . This issue has caused a religious storm . after an agreement from 1995 required Mormons to avoid submitting names . of Holocaust victims for baptism unless they are their direct ancestors. Mormons often perform the baptisms, saying people who died that did not get the chance to be baptised while living can choose to accept or deny it. But the issue is distressing many relatives. The Church has said sorry for all posthumous baptisms of Jews that have caused concern. A spokesman for the Church said it ‘keeps its word’ on not baptising Holocaust victims anymore. This latest incident was a ‘protocol breach’ because the baptism was not performed by a relative. The Church itself described this as ‘distressing’, insisting that it wants to stamp out the practice.","Wall Street Journal reporter was captured and killed in Pakistan in 2002 .

"First triple amputee from Afghanistan to survive injuries . Since rehab and birth of his son, feels his life has improved . Aims to cycle 3,000 miles round Britain's coast for charity . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 7:35 AM on 7th February 2012 . A hero Royal Marine who lost three limbs after kneeling on an IED in Afghanistan begged a comrade to shoot him moments after the blast. Brave Mark Ormrod, 28, was serving in Helmand Province on Christmas Eve in 2007 when the explosion ripped off both his legs and his right arm. Now fitted with artificial limbs, Mr Ormrod described in chilling detail the split-second his life changed forever - and how he begged for death. Purpose to life: Mark Ormrod pictured at home in Devon with wife Becky, 25, and 15 week-old baby boy Mason . Mr Ormrod said: 'I was lying naked and dying in the desert. I just thought I can’t live like this. I turned to the corporal and shouted: ""Stick a bullet through my head"". 'I was serious. I remember lying there thinking that I would feel like someone had . punched me in the back of the head and then it would go black and it . would be okay.' 'I used to be a lot more selfish. I was a different person. Since this all happened I am more positive' Mr Ormrod was second-in-command of a patrol circling their remote . Forward Operating Base in Helmand province. After nearly three hours, they had regrouped a couple of hundred feet from the main gate and were surveying the path ahead. Mr Ormrod said: 'I was in a bit of a hollow and I had my three guys looking out where I needed them. 'Then I knelt on this thing and it went off. 'When I detonated the IED all the sand and shingle was blown up and created a sandstorm.' The blast had torn off three of Mark's limbs. Road to recovery: Hero Royal Marine Mark Ormrod pictured during rehabilitation after he lost both legs and one arm while serving in Afghanistan . Speaking of those first seconds, Mark said: 'Initially I had no idea what I had done. I thought we had been hit by a mortar. 'When I tried to turn around I couldn’t. 'I went into a dream-like state, where I knew something was happening but it just didn’t feel real. 'I looked to one side and I could see my body armour had been blown off and was lying on the ground. I looked at one of the lads and I could see he was in shock. Then I looked down and I knew it was bad.' Pre-accident: Mark was serving in Helmand Province in December 2007 when his life changed forever . At this point Mark begged a colleague to put a bullet in his brain. He said: 'I remember lying there thinking that I would feel like someone had . punched me in the back of the head and then it would go black and it . would be okay.' Praying for death: Seconds after the blast, Mr Ormrod asked a comrade to kill him . His comrades called ‘man down’ and a medic was rushed out from the base just a few minutes away. Life-saving tourniquets were applied to his limbs and, despite the blood loss, Mark was able to take in the scene unfolding around him. He can recall being lifted on to a vehicle and even trying to reach after a man who fell out when it suddenly accelerated. Back at Birmingham’s Selly Oak Hospital, where all wounded servicemen are treated, Mark began his long road to recovery. It was painful and slow, not least because he was the first triple amputee from Afghanistan who had survived their injuries. He said: 'I hated being in the wheelchair. People will just blank you out. They don’t see you and they don’t realise they’re doing it.' Mr Ormrod now has hi-tech prosthetic legs and his wheelchair has been consigned to the shed of his home. The former Royal Marine with Taunton-based 40 Commando now has a 14-week-old son, Mason, with his wife Becky who he proposed to while in hospital after the blast. He said: 'I think everything happens for a reason. 'If I had died that day, then Mason wouldn’t be here. 'Before I was blown up, my life was pretty rubbish. When I was on leave I would stay out all night and sleep on my mates’ sofas. 'I used to be a lot more selfish. I was a different person. Since this all happened I am more positive. 'I’ve not got any internal injuries. I think I’ve got the best of a bad situation.' Mr Ormrod is working for the Royal Marines Association, a charitable group where he can support former servicemen in exactly the same way he has been helped. This year he has set himself the challenge of cycling nearly 3,000 miles round the British coastline. The event - Tour de Forces - will raise money for four military charities and sets off from Plymouth for the anti-clockwise circumnavigation.","First triple amputee from Afghanistan to survive injuries .

And the diversity of dialects in the U.S. are showcased in all their glory in the Dictionary of American Regional English (Dare). Fifty years after its inception, the fifth and final volume of the Dare dictionary has been published, covering words beginning with Sl to Z. Talking my language: The Dare dictionaries highlights the linguistic quirks that can be found in every nook and cranny of the United States . So now, words such as 'zydeco' join other bizarre terms such as 'upscuddle', 'pinkletink' and 'goozlum' in the completed volumes. Highlighting the linguistic quirks that can be found in every nook and cranny of the United States, the Dare dictionary is a record of American English as it is spoken by its residents - from its beginning up until the present. Unlike other dictionaries, it does not record the standard language used throughout the country. It instead documents regional and folk . speak; words, phrases and pronunciations which vary from one part of . the country to the other. And has proved to be an indispensable tool for many: Teachers, librarians, researchers, historians, playwrights, journalists physicians are all said to be faithful users of it. Jessie Sheidlower, the . Oxford English Dictionary's editor at large, told the New York Times: 'It’s a great and . extremely comprehensive project that really shows more than we’ve ever . known before about American dialect. I use it every day.' Sick to their stomachs in the Big Apple (pictured): New Yorkers who say they are feest mean they are disgusted or nauseated by something . Word jumble: 'Pinkletink' is the word for young frog and originates from Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts (pictured) The project began in 1962 when Frederic Cassidy, a professor of English at the University of Wisconsin-Madison was appointed editor of the first dictionary - the first to highlight the diversity of the American language. Between 1965 and 1970, a team of more than 80 researchers travelled to 1,002 communities all over America to conduct face-to-face interviews with 2,777 people to gauge the depth and diversity of the spoken word. The results of those interviews formed the basis of the first dictionary. The dictionary was due to be published as one whole works by Harvard University Press. However - after earnest editing - it became clear by 1980 that publishing Dare as a single unit would be impossible. It was then decided to publish each volume as and when it was ready, following the tradition of other historical dictionaries. Upscuddle (Southern Appalachian mountains): A noisy quarrel . Feest (New York): Disgusted with/nauseated by . Pinkletink (Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts): A young frog . Rumpelkammer (Michigan): A junk room/closet .

"By . Richard Hartley-parkinson . Last updated at 3:15 PM on 29th February 2012 . Christopher Gibson left a trail of cash leading to his house following an armed robbery at his local shop . As armed robbers go, this one isn't going to go down as the criminal mastermind of the 21st century. Christopher Gibson raided his local shop in Bournemouth but left a trail of cash leading police straight to his door as he ran from the shop keeper. Gibson was so well known by Kenan Yildrim that he had even been given credit by them in the past. So when his face mask slipped during a struggle with shop staff, they recognised him immediately. The father-of-three went to Premier Boscombe Superstores on January 20 and pointed a knife at Mr Yildrim's throat, demanding cash. Mr Yildrim pushed Gibson off the counter but he yanked the cash drawer from the till and ran from the shop to his house about 300 yards away around the corner with the store worker in pursuit. When police turned up at his door, led by the trail of cash, Gibson admitted 'Yeah, I did it'. Bournemouth Crown Court heard that the failed businessman's marriage had broken down and he was stealing to fund his £400-a-day cocaine habit. Prosecutor Simon Jones said Gibson was a regular at the shop and he stole between £500 and £600. He said: 'Kneeling [on the counter], he pointed the knife at Mr Yildirim’s throat and repeatedly said 'give me the till'. 'Mr Yildirim tried to push him away, . knocking him off balance. As he fell to the floor the cash drawer came . away and Mr Gibson ran out with it. Gibson threatened staff at Premier Boscombe Superstores in Bournemouth last month . 'Mr Yildirim pursued him to his home and police arrested him there and then after he said ""yeah I did it"".' Nigel Mitchell, defending, described the raid as 'very amateurish', and said: 'It was his local convenience store. 'They had even given him credit in the past and his mask came off as he left the shop. 'As he ran down the street the money was dropping on to the pavement, creating a path leading to his door.' The court heard that Gibson had turned to cocaine after his marriage had broken down. Mr Mitchell said: 'He has made a real hash of his life over recent years and that has caused him considerable shame.' Gibson admitted robbery and possessing an offensive weapon on January 20 this year. Recorder Stephen Climie jailed Gibson for two-and-a-half years for robbery and two months for shoplifting. He told him: 'Your record reflects your life. I’m satisfied this was an offence committed with a view to obtaining drugs for money.'","Christopher Gibson raided his local shop where staff know him so well they have given him credit in the past .

"By . Anthony Bond . Last updated at 9:51 PM on 20th February 2012 . Iran cut off oil sales to British companies yesterday after Foreign Secretary William Hague accused the Islamist regime of promoting terrorism. The oil ministry in Tehran announced that it had ceased all sales to the UK and France, escalating diplomatic tensions triggered by Iran’s nuclear programme. The move will have little effect on British firms, which get well under  1 per cent of their oil from Iran since the European Union has already slapped sanctions on the country and has vowed to stop buying all Iranian oil by July. Iran was supplying more than 700,000 barrels a day to the EU last year but this had already been cut back by 300,000 before yesterday’s move. Diplomacy: William Hague has warned Israel today that military action against Iran would not be 'a wise thing' Nevertheless it represented another ratcheting up of tensions. The action came less than 48 hours after Mr Hague accused Iran of threatening a new nuclear Cold War in the Middle East. Yesterday the Foreign Secretary accused the government of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of plotting terrorist outrages around the world. He said there was ‘no specific information’ about a threat to the London Olympics from any Tehran-backed terrorists. In a further escalation of rhetoric, Iran’s state-run news agency suggested the country was capable of sinking British warships in the Gulf. In a report published yesterday, it said it was ‘Britain that would suffer unwelcome consequences if it joins its mentors in the U.S. and the Israeli regime to attack Iran’. Alireza Nikzad, a spokesman for the oil ministry said: 'Exporting crude to British and French companies has been stopped ... we will sell our oil to new customers.' The decision comes after European Union member states had agreed to stop importing Iranian crude from July. The agreement was intended to pressure Iran to stop enriching uranium over increasing concerns of its nuclear programme. In an interview with BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show, the Foreign Secretary repeated his warning that a nuclear-armed Iran would result in another cold war in the Middle East. 'They would either be attacked and there would be a war, or there would be a cold war in which Iran for the long term would be subject to these very intense economic sanctions and they would find that other nations in their region developed nuclear weapons,' he said. Aggression: Mr Hague's warning today follows rumours that the Israeli government is considering strikes against Iran within months. Pictured is Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu . But he urged against military action, although he said it was not ruled out as an option. 'I don’t think a wise thing at this moment is for Israel to launch a military attack on Iran,' he said. 'I . think Israel like everyone else in the world should be giving a real . chance to the approach we have adopted on very serious economic . sanctions and economic pressure and the readiness to negotiate with . Iran. 'That’s what we need to make a success of.' Mr Hague said Israel did not share its plans with Britain. 'We do not take any options off the table, we don’t know how the situation will develop, it would be unwise to do that,' he said. 'But our approach is 100 per cent diplomatically and economically focused to bring Iran to the negotiating table.' The United States also pushed Israel not . to strike Iran, with Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen Martin Dempsey leading . the American call for restraint. Mr Hague said there was 'no specific information' about a threat to the London Olympics from any Tehran-backed terrorists. But he acknowledged: 'Clearly Iran has been involved increasingly in illegal and potentially terrorist activity in other parts of the world. 'I think Iran has increased its willingness to contemplate utterly illegal activities in other parts of the world. This is part of the danger that Iran is presenting to the peace of the world.' Developments: Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad watches from a control room as nuclear fuel rods are loaded into the Tehran Research Reactor on Wednesday . Shadow foreign secretary Douglas . Alexander called for 'calm heads and clear thinking', but said Iran . needed to feel the international community’s 'full force'. He . told Sky News’ Murnaghan programme: 'The right approach at this stage . is to push forward the twin-track approach: on the one hand offering . genuine engagement, on the other hand tightening the peaceful pressure, . strengthening the sanctions that are being felt at the moment. 'When the international community says, ""All options need to be left on the table"", I agree. Mr Alexander said the Government should focus not on 'raising the rhetoric, but on redoubling their efforts to secure a diplomatic and peaceful outcome'. Diplomats also warned today that Iran is poised to greatly expand uranium enrichment at a fortified underground bunker to a point that would boost how quickly it could make nuclear warheads. They said Tehran had put finishing touches for the installation of thousands of new-generation centrifuges at the cavernous bunker - machines that can produce enriched uranium much more quickly and efficiently than its present machines. Worrying: President Ahmadinejad, second left, visit Tehran's nuclear reactor on Wednesday where he introduced three new nuclear projects . While saying that the electrical circuitry, piping and supporting equipment for the new centrifuges was now in place, the diplomats emphasised that Tehran had not started installing the new machines at its Fordo facility and could not say whether it was planning to. Still, the senior diplomats - who asked for anonymity because their information was privileged - suggested that Tehran would have little reason to prepare the ground for the better centrifuges unless it planned to operate them. They spoke in recent interviews - the last one yesterday. The reported work at Fordo appeared to reflect Iran’s determination to forge ahead with nuclear activity that could be used to make atomic arms despite rapidly escalating international sanctions and the latent threat of an Israeli military strike on its nuclear facilities. Fordo could be used to make fissile warhead material even without such an upgrade, the diplomats said. They said that although older than Iran’s new generation machines, the centrifuges now operating there can be reconfigured within days to make such material because they already are enriching to 20 per cent - a level that can be boosted quickly to weapons-grade quality. Their comments appeared to represent the first time anyone had quantified the time it would take to reconfigure the Fordo centrifuges into machines making weapons-grade material. Moving forward: Iranian state TV shows centrifuges at Iranian Natanz nuclear site. Diplomats warned today that Tehran had put the finishing touches on the installation of thousands of new-generation centrifuges at a underground bunker . In contrast, Iran’s older enrichment site at Natanz is producing uranium at 3.4 per cent, a level normally used to power reactors. While that too could be turned into weapons-grade uranium, reassembling from low to weapons-grade production is complex, and retooling the thousands of centrifuges at Natanz would probably take weeks. The diplomats’ comments come as International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors are due to visit Tehran today. Their trip - the second this month - is another attempt to break more than three years of Iranian stonewalling about claims that it has - or is - secretly working on nuclear weapons that would be armed with uranium enriched to 90 per cent or more. Iran says it is enriching only to make nuclear fuel. But because enrichment can also create fissile warhead material, the United Nations Security Council has imposed sanctions on Tehran in a failed attempt to force it to stop. More recently, the US, the European Union and other Western allies have either tightened up their own sanctions or rapidly put new penalties in place striking at the heart of Iran’s oil exports lifeline and its financial system. The most recent squeeze on Iran was announced on Friday, when Brussels-based Swift, a financial clearing house used by virtually every country and major corporation in the world, agreed to shut out the Islamic Republic from its network.","Foreign Secretary's comments follow rumours that Israel is considering strikes against Iran within months .

Warning: Foreign Secretary William Hague, speaking on the Andrew Marr show yesterday, told Britions in Greece to prepare to leave if the country goes under . Britons in Greece were warned yesterday they may have to be evacuated. It comes as eurozone ministers prepare to sign off another £108billion rescue package for the crippled economy. Tonight as the bailout approaches, Netherlands Finance Minister has said it's 'really an issue' that Greece has 'time and time again' failed to satisfy the conditions imposed upon it by the international community. Foreign Secretary William Hague revealed Britons were being urged to register with the consulate as officials are updating plans to evacuate citizens ‘on a daily basis’ in case Greece goes under. There has been widespread civil unrest in the country as the prospect of it defaulting on its loans and exiting the euro has grown. Last night 3,000 protesters clashed with riot police in Athens as Greek prime minister Lucas Papademos flew to Brussels for last-minute preparations to seal the bailout deal. As demonstrators poured into he capital's central Syntagma square riot police shielded the national assembly. Economists do not expect the new package to resolve Greece's economic problems which could take up to a decade to tackle. French finance minister Francois Baroin told Europe-1 radio that Europe's leaders were committed to agreeing a new bailout package. 'We now have all the elements of a deal - elements of a participation that remains voluntary for banks and private lenders, and for public lenders states, central banks,' he said. 'We hope we and the Eurogroup members can take into account all the Greek government has been done for several weeks - even several months,' he said. Protests: A petrol bomb explodes near riot police officers in Athens last night during fresh protests over austerity measures in Athens . Riots: Protesters are clashing with police on a daily basis now as authorities try to keep a lid on public fury over crippling austerity initiatives . The Greek government has already . pushed a massive austerity and reform package though parliament and is . expected to introduce two more pieces of emergency legislation, . including wage and pension cuts today. Mr Hague said the bailout was a matter for Greece and the eurozone, but the UK wanted ‘an end to the uncertainty’. He added: ‘We have prepared . contingency plans if we need to help British nationals who are there in . any way. We keep those up to date on a daily basis.’ Fellow . Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt called on Britons in Greece to . ‘register with a consular system so we can find them in situations of . emergency’. He . added: ‘No UK national who is there at the moment is unaware of what’s . happening, so we’ve got systems in place... should the worst happen.’ Austerity anger: A protester attacks police during a demonstration in Athens' main Syntagma square last night as the Greek parliament prepares to vote on cuts needed before a £108bn EU bailout . As the final details of the package are put in place senior eurozone and European Central . Bank officials held a conference call yesterday to discuss the £108bn bailout programme. While there is still scepticism in . Germany and other countries that Greece will be able to live up to its . commitments - including implementing €3.3 billion euros of spending cuts . and tax increases - officials said the deal is close to being signed off. But the prospect of further . disturbances in Greece loomed again when Germany was accused of seeking . to undermine democracy in Athens. Eurozone . finance chiefs will consider a German proposal to ban the Greeks from . receiving cash unless they delay their general election due in April. German . finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble wants to keep a technocratic Greek . government in place to ensure austerity measures are taken. Storm: Riot police spray tear gas during the demonstration involving 3,000 people in Syntagma Square last night - a week after a much larger protest . Fury: Protesters outside the Greek Parliament campaign against plans by Lucas Papademos' government to save more than 3.3billion euros by cutting benefits and the minimum wage . Under the plan, officials from the . European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International . Monetary Fund will establish a permanent office in Athens to exercise . day-to-day control of spending. But Eurosceptics condemned the plans. Tory . MP Peter Bone said: ‘Greece is the birthplace of democracy and they . fought valiantly against aggression during the Second World War to stop . losing their identity. ‘What they’re being asked to do is sacrifice their sovereignty to stop them from going bust. It’s a recipe for utter disaster. ‘Good . money is being poured after bad. They need to come out of the euro, . devalue their currency and default on their debts. That’s the only . future for Greece if they want to be a proud independent nation again.’ Mark Pritchard, secretary of the Tory backbench 1922 Committee, said: ‘If true, this is a dangerous precedent which should be resisted at all costs. ‘Unless people have a stake in the future of their countries, they will be less likely to accept the remedies required.’ The Greek Minister for International Economic Affairs, Constantine Papadopoulos, denied that Greece has any contingency plan for a default. He said: ‘No, because that would destroy the economy. You don’t factor in options that will kill off any hope for redemption. ‘Now we have to work within a very strict plan in the hope of returning back to growth and becoming a full-fledged member of the eurozone again. Not exit the eurozone.’ Under one crucial element of the new bailout . deal, Greece will have around €100 billion of debt written off via a . restructuring involving private-sector holders of Greek government . bonds. The overall objective is to reduce Greece's debts from 160 per cent of . GDP to around 120 per cent by 2020 to put their debt on a more sustainable footing.

"By . Associated Press . Last updated at 4:28 PM on 29th February 2012 . A Texas doctor has been charged with running a massive health fraud care scheme with thousands of fraudulent patients and intermediaries allegedly offering cash, food stamps or free groceries, to bilk Medicare and Medicaid of nearly $375million. A federal indictment unsealed Tuesday charges Jacques Roy, a doctor who owned Medistat Group Associates in DeSoto, Texas, and six others in an alleged scheme to bill Medicare for home health services that were not properly billed, not medically necessary or not done. The scheme was the largest dollar amount by a single doctor uncovered by a task force on Medicare fraud, authorities said. Address: Daniel R Levinson, Inspector General U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, centre, pauses during a news conference on Tuesday, where he addressed allegations against Jacques Roy . U.S. Attorney Sarah Saldana accused Roy of 'selling his signature' to home health agencies that rounded up thousands of patients' names and billed Medicare and Medicaid for five years. The indictment alleged that from January 2006 through November 2011, Roy or others certified 11,000 Medicare beneficiaries for more than 500 home health service agencies - more patients than any other medical practice in the U.S. More than 75 of those agencies have had their Medicare payments suspended. Roy, 54, is charged with several counts of health care fraud and conspiracy to commit health care fraud. He faces up to 100 years in prison if convicted on all counts. He appeared briefly in court Tuesday and is scheduled to have a detention hearing on Wednesday. Authorities also moved to seize cash in Roy's bank accounts, cars and two sailboats. His attorney, Patrick McLain, said authorities had contacted Roy months ago. McLain said it was too soon to comment on the case because prosecutors hadn't provided him with most of the evidence yet. Phone messages and emails left with Medistat, located just south of Dallas, were not immediately returned on Tuesday. Allegations: Dr Peter Budetti, Deputy Administrator for Program Integrity with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, center, speaks about a healthcare fraud scheme . The attorney for one of the home health agency owners, Cynthia Stiger, alleged to be part of the scheme called the charges and the dollar amounts listed overblown. Stiger pleaded not guilty on Tuesday. 'They're not anywhere close to accurate,' said Jeffrey Grass, Stiger's attorney. Investigators for the U.S. Health and Human Services department noticed irregularities with Roy's practice about one year ago, officials said. Roy had 'recruiters' finding people to bill for home health services, said Saldana, the top federal prosecutor in Dallas. Some of those alleged patients, when approached by investigators, were found working on their cars and clearly not in need of home healthcare, she said. Medicare patients qualify for home health care if they are confined to their homes and need care there, according to the indictment. Saldana said Roy used the home health agencies as 'his soldiers on the ground to go door to door to recruit Medicare beneficiaries.' 'He was selling his signature,' she said. For example, authorities allege Charity Eleda, one of the home health agency owners charged in the scheme, visited a Dallas homeless shelter to recruit homeless beneficiaries staying at the facility, paying recruiters $50 for each person they found. A message was left Tuesday at Eleda's Dallas-based company, Charry Home Care Services, Inc. Press conference: W Rick Copeland, Director of Medical Fraud Control Unit of the Press Office of the Texas Attorney General, stands next to a chart outlining the healthcare fraud scheme on Tuesday . Greetings: FBI Special Agent in Charge of Dallas Field Office, Robert E Casey, left, shakes hands with Mr Copeland at the conference . Others indicted are accused of offering free health care and services such as food stamps to anyone who signed up and offered their Medicare number. Roy would 'make home visits to that beneficiary, provide unnecessary medical services and order unnecessary durable medical equipment for that beneficiary,' the indictment alleged. 'Medistat would then bill Medicare for those visits and services.' The indictment says Roy's business manager - identified only by his initials - recorded conversations between the two in January 2006. The business manager heard Roy describe his alleged scheme and refuse to market for patients in a legitimate way, the indictment said. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services also announced the suspension of an additional 78 home health agencies associated with Roy. The agencies were collecting about $2.3million a month, said Peter Budetti, CMS' deputy administrator for program integrity. The alleged fraud went unnoticed for several years. After CMS suspended Medicare provider accounts belonging to Roy and Medistat last July, Medistat's employees allegedly started billing Medicare under a different provider number under Roy's supervision, authorities said. Until recently, HHS could not effectively track data to identify the kind of fraud now linked to Roy, who was billing beneficiaries 'off the charts' for more than five years, officials said. The department's inspector general, Dan Levinson, told reporters the department's technology 'has not come online as quickly as we'd like to see.' The department is now beefing up its data analysis and tracking other cases, Levinson said. It has also established task forces in several U.S. cities to track Medicare fraud, officials said. 'We're now able to use those data analytic tools in ways - in 2012 and 2011 - that no, we really could not have done in years past,' Levinson said. A spokesman for Trailblazer Health Enterprises, which paid home health claims through a contract with federal authorities, did not return a phone message Tuesday. Health care fraud is estimated to cost the government at least $60billion a year, mainly in losses to Medicare and Medicaid. Officials say the fraud involves everything from sophisticated marketing schemes by major pharmaceuticals encouraging doctors to prescribe drugs for unauthorized uses to selling motorized wheelchairs to people who don't need them. 'These are public programs, and we must protect them for future generations,' Saldana said.","Jacques Roy owned Medistat Group Associates in DeSoto, Texas .

"By . Andy Dolan . Last updated at 9:17 AM on 28th February 2012 . A grandfather who was so scared of being burgled that he slept downstairs in his armchair was throttled to death by a serial thief who had been released early. Paul Cox had taken to spending nights in his living room two years earlier after becoming the victim of burglaries only months apart. But his fear of being targeted again became a reality when he was killed by drunken intruder Cory Youlden, who escaped with a bag of coins and Mr Cox’s car. Serial offender: Murderer Cory Youlden had been out of prison on licence for just three months when he savagely strangled  Paul Cox (right) The disabled grandfather’s body was . found hours later, slumped at the foot of his chair in the home he had . lived in for 55 years. Mr Cox died just four days before his 84th . birthday. Yesterday, Youlden, who had 24 other convictions, was jailed for life with a minimum tariff of 22 years for the savage crime. He carried out the attack three months . after being released on licence, half-way through a 42-month sentence . for three street robberies. After strangling Mr Cox in a headlock, he tried to erase forensic evidence by cleaning up with bleach, the court heard. He then left the house at Rednal, . Worcestershire, in his victim’s Ford Focus, having taken the keys along . with the cash from Mr Cox’s pocket. Prosecutor Alex Warren said Youlden, . 23, smashed a bay window to break in to the semi-detached home in the . early hours, after storming out of his girlfriend’s home during a row. The barrister added: ‘Mr Cox had been burgled on two previous occasions . in 2009. ‘He had started sleeping downstairs in a chair with a hammer because he was afraid of further burglaries.’ Mr Warren said that after a . confrontation in the rear sitting room – where Mr Cox was sleeping with . an electric fire on for warmth – Youlden left his victim ‘dead or . dying’. He said footprints matching Youlden’s . shoes were discovered upstairs while the defendant’s fingerprints were . found on the smashed window pane. Scene: Mr Cox was found dead in the living room of his home in Rednal, Worcestershire, in June last year . Police were called after a neighbour noticed Mr Cox’s car was missing. Mr Cox, who had separated from his . wife 40 years ago, suffered from coronary heart disease, was blind in . one eye and partially deaf, the court heard. He had carried out his national . service in the Royal Engineers, stationed in Palestine and Egypt, and . spent much of his working life as an engineer and toolmaker for . Cadbury’s. A post-mortem examination found the pensioner died of pressure to the neck. Youlden was arrested two days after the killing in June. By then he had sold Mr Cox’s car for £400. It was found burned out. Stephen Lineham QC, defending, told . Worcester Crown Court Youlden had had a ‘wretched life’, having been . fostered at 11 months and later adopted. Youlden, whose address was given as a hostel in Birmingham, admitted murder, theft and burglary earlier this month. Jailed: Worcester Crown Court (pictured) heard that Youlden had served half of a 42-month sentence for a string of street robberies when he murdered Mr Cox . The court heard the father of one, who . was first convicted at 14, had a string of burglaries and robberies to . his name. Judge Robert Juckes QC said Mr Cox had offered Youlden ‘little . by way of resistance’ but was nevertheless held in a headlock for . between 15 and 20 seconds. He told the defendant: ‘You not only killed him but you left him on the ground after taking from him money and keys. ‘You are a young man with an appalling record of burglary.’ Mr Cox is survived by his son Greg, 58, daughter Jane, 54, a brother and two grandchildren. In a statement, the family said it is . they ‘who feel they have the life sentence’, adding Mr Cox had been . living independently, ‘still able to enjoy life, have a pint, watch . sport and spend time with his family’. Detective Chief Inspector Paul Williamson, of West Mercia Police, said Youlden was ‘deceitful, callous and calculated’. The ‘tragic and brutal killing of a vulnerable man’ was ‘all the more senseless because Youlden gained very little, he added.","Cory Youlden had been out of jail for just three months when he throttled defenceless pensioner .

"By . Reuters Reporter . Last updated at 9:42 PM on 16th February 2012 . The careworn house not far from Santa Monica Boulevard resembles millions of other homes that have been foreclosed on since the calamitous U.S. housing crash four years ago. Garbage spews from trash bags behind the property. A smashed television leans against broken furniture. A filthy toy dog lies on its side, an ear draped across its face. The garden is overgrown. The house needs a paint job. Yet the property on North Rexford Drive, Beverly Hills, California, is no ordinary foreclosure. FORECLOSED: This sprawling, Spanish-style estate is one of many foreclosures in Beverly Hills. Its former owners were $205,000 behind in their payments on mortgages totaling $6.9 million . A sprawling, Spanish-style estate, fringed by majestic pine trees and located near the boutiques of Santa Monica Boulevard, its former owners were served with a default notice in 2010; they were $205,000 behind in their payments on mortgages totaling $6.9 million. Welcome to foreclosure Beverly Hills-style. Some 180 houses in Beverly Hills, the storied Los Angeles enclave rich with Hollywood stars and music moguls, have been foreclosed on by lenders, scheduled for auction, or served with a default notice, the highest level since the 2008 financial crash, according to a Reuters analysis of figures compiled by RealtyTrac, which tracks foreclosures nationwide. As in the default-ravaged suburban subdivisions of Phoenix, Arizona, and Tampa, Florida, plunging real estate prices are the root of the problem in Beverly Hills. But the dynamics of the residential real estate collapse are very different in elite neighborhoods such as this. The majority of delinquent homeowners here owe more than $1 million. Many are walking away not because they can't pay, but because they judge it would be foolish to keep doing so. 'It's a business decision, not an emotional one which it is for normal people,' said Deborah Bremner, owner of the Bremner Group at Coldwell Banker, which specializes in high-end properties in the Los Angeles area. 'I go to cocktail parties and all people are talking about is whether it is time to walk away, although they will never be quoted in the real world.' The mansion, overgrown, abandoned and badly in need of a paint job, is one of 180 foreclosures in the wealthy Los Angeles enclave . She said she had seen in Beverly Hills a big increase in 'strategic defaults,' in which owners who can still afford to make their monthly mortgage payment choose not to because the property is now worth so much less than the giant loan used to buy it during the housing bubble. Strategic default is an especially appealing option in California, one of only a handful of U.S. states where primary mortgages made by banks are 'non-recourse' loans. That means the loan is secured solely by the property, and banks cannot go after a delinquent owner's wages or other assets if they default. Bremner said she helped a client buy a Beverly Hills mansion last year that the prior owner had bought for over $4 million. He decided to stop paying his $3 million mortgage - even though he could easily afford it - when the value of the property had dropped to $2.5 million. 'They were able to comfortably cover the loan,' Bremner said. 'They were just no longer willing to see the value of the property drop.' A huge 'shadow inventory' is building of elite homes that are in default but have not been put on the market. Of the 180 distressed properties in Beverly Hills, only 12 are up for sale. The backlog reflects the pent-up flood of foreclosed properties of all price ranges that are expected to hit the U.S. market this year, especially after five major banks reached a $25 billion settlement last week with the U.S. over fraudulent foreclosure practices. Default is a popular option in California as banks cannot go after other assets, only the property used to secure the loan. That is not the case in most states, including foreclosure ridden Florida, where the pictured home is located . Across the United States, the largest increase in foreclosures and delinquencies, compared with 2008 levels, is with 'jumbo' mortgages - loans too large to be insured by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government controlled mortgage finance providers. Foreclosures on jumbo loans are up 579 percent since 2008, greater than any other form of loan, according to a report last month by Lender Processing Services, Inc. Strategic defaults are now more likely among jumbo loan-holders than any other type of borrower, according to a report issued late last year by JPMorgan Chase & Co. Nearly 40 percent of delinquencies among non-governmental mortgages, which are mostly jumbo loans, are strategic defaults, the report said. 'Now that these homeowners with jumbo loans are finding out you can do this, more and more are doing strategic foreclosures,' said Jon Maddux the CEO of YouWalkAway.com, which advises homeowners who are 'underwater,' the term for those whose loans exceed the value of their home. Nathaniel J. Friedman, a Beverly Hills lawyer, insists he is not a strategic defaulter - that he never missed a mortgage payment in his life. But he stopped making payments on his five-bedroom, six-bathroom Beverly Hills house on Schuyler Road three years ago. Friedman, who had mortgages totaling $3 million with the now-defunct Countrywide Home Loans, returned home one evening in January 2009 to find a letter from Countrywide freezing his $150,000 line of credit, which was linked to his second $900,000 loan. His primary loan was $2.1 million. The property is worth about $2 million today. Friedman says he decided to stop paying out of a sense of vengeance from the moment he received that letter. He has been in negotiations for months with Bank of America, which took over Countrywide after its collapse, to modify the loan. 'I thought to hell with it,' he told Reuters. 'Why should I keep feeding a dead horse if the bank has no confidence in me?' 'I was able to maneuver things my way because of the inertia of the banking sector,' Friedman said. He believes the bank will blink first, and eventually modify his loan.","Majority of delinquent homeowners in Beverly Hills owe over $1million .

"By . Vanessa Allen . Last updated at 9:25 AM on 28th February 2012 . Television presenter Fiona Phillips has claimed a ‘chemical cosh’ of dementia drugs robbed her father of the final weeks of his life. The former GMTV host described how her father Neville was given a vast cocktail of medicines which left him so heavily sedated he was ‘totally out of it’. His medication covered two sides of an A4 sheet of paper, she said. Heartbroken: Fiona Phillips, pictured with her father Neville in 2009, claimed that dementia drugs robbed him of the final weeks of his life . Alzheimer’s sufferer Mr Phillips died . earlier this month. His rapid deterioration has led his daughter to . question whether the drugs cost him years of his life. She said: ‘I am so angry at the way my . lovely, lovely dad was treated at the end. In his final weeks he was so . coshed by drugs that his poor body couldn’t cope. ‘They robbed him of his laughter, then . his smile, which was all that he had got left, and I am absolutely . furious about that. Then they robbed him of his life. ‘That is what is keeping me awake at . night now, it’s the anger. Without the powerful drugs they used to . sedate him he could have had another few years. Tragic: Fiona, second from right, with her mother Amy who died in 2006 and father Neville who died in 2012 . By SOPHIE BORLAND . More than a quarter of elderly people with dementia are being given dangerous ‘chemical cosh’ drugs, researchers warn. Doctors . are prescribing anti-psychotics to patients for two or more years even . though they are only meant to be taken for a maximum of three months – . and then only as a last resort. Antipsychotics . are tranquillisers that are designed to treat hallucinations in . patients with schizophrenia or other mental illnesses. But . researchers from the University of Manchester have found that in most cases they are just being given to . sedate elderly patients to stop them from wandering off or becoming . confused and anxious. Campaigners . say that too often they are being told by families and carers that such . drugs are ‘robbing loved ones of their dignity’, leaving them unable to . walk or talk. The drugs were given the chemical cosh . nickname because they are used to subdue patients, which makes it easier . for hospital and care home staff to look after them. But . researchers have warned that they double the risk of early death – . leading to an estimated 1,800 premature deaths a year – and treble the . risk of strokes. Studies have also found they reduce brain volume and . worsen the symptoms of dementia. Typical antipsychotics given to patients . include chlorpromazine, perphenazine, pimozide, clozapine (sold as . Clozaril or Denzapine), olanzapine (sold as Zyprexa) and risperidone . (sold as Risperdal). But only risperidone is licensed for dementia – and . then only for up to six weeks. ‘Maybe I’m being selfish because he . wouldn’t have wanted to continue to be dependent on others. But that . wasn’t a decision to be made by the medical system on his behalf ... Without those drugs he could still have been healthy and happy, even . with dementia.’ Miss Phillips, 51, has endured . watching both her parents succumb to Alzheimer’s and has told of her . fears she may also develop the degenerative disease. Her mother Amy was diagnosed in her . late 50s and died in 2006, just a few months before Mr Phillips also . received the devastating diagnosis. He was in his late 60s. Miss Phillips, a Daily Mirror . columnist, told the newspaper her father had managed a degree of . independence despite the disease, and lived in a warden-assisted flat in . Hampshire for three years. But last November he went missing for . eight hours after he wandered off alone. Social workers insisted he was . sent to a specialist dementia care home. The placement lasted just 24 hours . before managers complained that he had lashed out at a carer. He was . moved to a psychiatric hospital, where he was immediately put on a . mixture of drugs. Miss Phillips said: ‘I visited him on . December 23 and he was smiling and laughing and said “She’s mine” when I . walked in, which had been his way of greeting me for a while. ‘Even though he no longer said my name, he recognised me. All the members of staff said how wonderful he was.’ But when she returned a few days . later, she said she found her father slumped in a chair and heavily . sedated. She requested a list of his medication and said it stretched to . two sides of A4 paper. Miss Phillips recalled how she asked . for the drugs to be reduced and told how her own research had shown two . sedatives he was taking were addictive and could cause cognitive . decline. In addition, she said that the . anti-psychotic drug he was on was known to increase the risk of death in . dementia sufferers and was advised as a last resort. Fiona quit her role as GMTV presenter after 12 years to spend more time with her family . She described her shock on her next . visit at her father’s rapid deterioration, saying: ‘He’d put on weight . from the drugs and his hair was white. “Oh Dad,” I said, “What have they . done to you?” And I broke down in tears. ‘But there was no response, he was totally out of it. His body had been clobbered with drugs. ‘He was like someone out of One Flew . Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. My heart was broken. Next time I went his eyes . were glazed, his mouth was hanging open and his tongue was lolling.’ Miss Phillips said she alerted nurses . to her father’s laboured breathing and high temperature and, six days . later, he was admitted to a general hospital with pneumonia. Doctors . warned his organs were failing. He died a few days later, aged 77. Researchers have revealed that more than a quarter of elderly dementia sufferers are being subdued with ‘chemical cosh’ drugs. They warned earlier this month that . some medications can double the risk of early death – leading to an . estimated 1,800 premature deaths a year – and treble the risk of . strokes. Studies have also found they reduce brain volume and worsen the . symptoms of dementia. The Daily Mail has long called for an . improvement in the care of dementia sufferers as part of our Dignity for . the Elderly campaign. Miss Phillips, who has two sons, . Nathaniel, 12, and Mackenzie, nine, with her husband Martin Frizell, has . become an ambassador for the Alzheimer’s Society.

Pressure was growing on the  Cambridge Union last night to reverse its controversial decision to invite Dominique Strauss-Kahn to speak to its members. Anti-violence groups and students alike have called on the debating society to reconsider its offer to the disgraced former head of the International Monetary Fund. Strauss-Kahn, 62, who is facing a civil case over the alleged rape of a hotel maid in New York and is now being investigated about a prostitution ring, has confirmed he will address students next month. Cambridge University students’ union women’s campaign had already attacked the invitation, saying it ‘trivialised’ the distress suffered by sex attack victims. A petition it launched is also growing in support, with more than 500 signatures collected so far. And in a fresh attack, it said hosting Strauss-Kahn ‘feeds an existent culture of silence and shame around rape, in which alleged perpetrators are given a platform mostly denied to survivors of sexual violence’. It added: ‘Free speech is about more than inviting rich, white, powerful men [in this case an alleged rapist] to define the Union’s term card year after year.’ The Cambridge Union has defended the invitation, saying Strauss-Kahn is ‘exceptionally well qualified’ to talk about the state of the eurozone and the global economy. Debates: Glamour model Katie Price, left, is one of hundreds of famous figures who have appeared at the Cambridge Union over the years . But Holly Dustin, of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said: ‘Dominique Strauss-Kahn is a powerful global figure who has been accused of a string of sexual offences and is still under investigation for his role in a prostitution ring. ‘By inviting him to speak, the Cambridge Union risks colluding with attitudes that condone or trivialise violence against women.’ Caitlin Doherty, 21, an English literature student at St John’s College, said: ‘For the Cambridge Union to defend their decision on the grounds that students would be interested is ridiculous. ‘I would like to see them withdraw the invitation and issue an apology to the women who say they have been victims of this man for the lack of respect they have shown them.’ Susy Langsdale, 22, who is studying history of art at King’s College, said: ‘It dismisses the fact that he is in the middle of a trial about his own sexual morality and endorses him. You can’t separate the economics from his personal behaviour.’ But Katie Lam, president of the Cambridge Union, last night again insisted the talk will go ahead on March 4.","More than 500 sign petition calling for him to be banned from giving speech .

"By . Sophie Borland . Last updated at 1:58 AM on 23rd February 2012 . The NHS is paying GPs to look after 2.5million ‘ghost’ patients, ministers admitted last night. Doctors are receiving an estimated £162million a year – footed by the taxpayer – for non-existent patients on their books who have moved house, left the country or been dead for up to 40 years. The Audit Commission has counted that in a single year at least 95,000 such ‘ghost’ patients were registered with GPs and earning them annual payments. But the Department of Health last night admitted there are probably up to 2.5million such patients on doctors’ lists in England. Empty: The NHS are paying doctors millions each year to look after 'ghost' patients who are on their surgeries' books but who have moved house, left the country or died . Every year GP surgeries are paid an average of £65 for each patient they have on their books, regardless  of how often – or whether – they make an appointment or what treatments they receive. Although there are currently 55million patients registered with GPs, there are only 52.5million actually living in England. It means the NHS is potentially wasting £162.5million every year on ghost patients. Outraged: Katherine Murphy of the Patients Association wants to know why taxpayers' money was wasted in this way . Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, said it was ‘outrageous’ that money was being wasted to treat patients ‘that only exist within NHS bureaucracy’. Surgeries are meant to keep their lists up to date and take patients off when they die or move away, but this is frequently overlooked. In some cases doctors have been found to be deliberately keeping patients on their books to earn themselves extra cash. Last year the Mail revealed that four doctors at a surgery in Streatham, south London, were being investigated over a scam in which they were claimed to have 3,000 patients on their books who did not exist or had false information on their records that brought in extra NHS cash. Of the latest findings, Mrs Murphy added: ‘At a time when the NHS is being asked to make huge efficiency savings the Government needs to provide answers as to how money was wasted in this way.’ In its extensive investigation the Audit Commission, the Government’s spending watchdog, compared surgery lists to check patients were not registered with more than one GP if they had moved house. The officials also compared these lists with Government records of deaths and data on failed asylum seekers who have since been deported. When officials came across patients registered with two surgeries, or those recorded as being dead or deported, they contacted the local NHS body which asked practices to check that their lists were up to date. Health Minister Lord Howe, left, said that the NHS needed to make the best use of funds available while Andy McKeon said it was disappointing some areas had not followed up information provided by the investigation . The investigation, called the National . Duplicate Registration Initiative (NDRI), covered 2009 to 2010. It . found there were up to 32,668 dead patients on lists – including 157 who . had died more than 30 years ago. Officials even came across one surgery which was being paid every year to treat a patient who had died in 1969. A further 29,416 patients had moved house and were registered with a different GP, but both their old and new surgeries were being paid for treating them. Another 20,000 patients were removed from the lists when officials found they were not living at the address shown on the books. The officials also discovered 10,000 failed asylum seekers were on GPs’ books even though they had since been returned to their home country. Not all surgeries flagged up by the Audit Commission for having high numbers of ghost patients bothered to check their lists. Health minister Lord Howe said: ‘The NHS needs to make the best use of the funds it has available and avoid giving GPs extra income for patients who have moved away or died. Identifying ‘ghost patients’ will ensure that practices are fairly funded only for the patients they are responsible for.’ Andy McKeon, managing director of health at the Audit Commission, said: ‘The NHS and GPs generally manage patient lists well – at any one time there are some  58million records and many movements on and off lists. ‘It is disappointing that some areas did not rigorously follow up the information provided by NDRI.’ David Stout, deputy chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents NHS staff, said: ‘It is important to make sure that lists of registered patients are up to date and accurate. ‘Being able to plan and offer the most appropriate care for local people depends on accurate information.’","55 million people registered with a doctor in England - despite population being 52.5m .

"By . Emily Allen and Chris Parsons . Last updated at 1:21 PM on 29th February 2012 . Detectives at Scotland Yard lent Rebekah Brooks (pictured at the Newbury Races last year) a police horse which she acted as a 'foster carer' for . The retired police horse loaned to Rebekah Brooks was returned to the Met Police in a 'poor condition', the force said today. The former Sun editor 'fostered' the animal, called Raisa, when it retired from active service with Scotland Yard and returned it in 2010. But the 43-year-old, who rode the horse at her farm in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, returned the animal to the Met in a worse condition than when she received it. Following the news that Brooks had been loaned the horse, Rupert Murdoch leapt to the defence of the former News International boss. Murdoch tweeted this morning: 'Now they are complaining about R Brooks saving an old horse from the glue factory!' Scotland Yard said that Ms Brooks, a keen rider, was given permission to take charge of the horse in 2008. But after acting as a 'foster carer' for the animal for two years, she returned it in a 'poor condition', said a spokesman. He said: 'In 2007 a request was made by Rebekah Brooks to home a retired police horse. 'Mounted Branch conducted the normal property and welfare inspection, which was passed. As a result 22-year-old retired horse Raisa was loaned to Rebekah Brooks in 2008. 'The MPS was contacted in early 2010 by an individual on behalf of Rebekah Brooks who asked the MPS to re-home Raisa, which was then 24, due to the horse no longer being ridden. 'When the horse was returned Raisa was regarded by officers from Mounted Branch to be in a poor but not serious condition.' Raisa later died of natural causes. The claims that Raisa was mistreated were today fiercely denied by Mrs Brooks's husband Charlie. According to the Evening Standard, renowned racehorse trainer Mr Brooks said: 'I have been around and looked after horses all my life and I am confident that I know more about caring for them than people at the Metropolitan police.' Despite Mr Murdoch's public backing of Brooks, the 80-year-old media tycoon's staunch defence was rubbished by some critics. Labour MP Tom Watson, who famously grilled Murdoch and his son James at the Home Affairs select committee in July, replied to Rupert Murdoch's tweet saying: 'You comment on her horse but not on her insider knowledge of a criminal investigation into your company. Have you no shame?' Most of the Met's police horses are retired with The Horse Trust charity in Buckinghamshire. Brooks, a keen rider, is married to racehorse trainer and Old Etonian Charlie Brooks. Defence: Rupert Murdoch stood by former News International boss Brooks following the news she was loaned a horse . Close: Rupert Murdoch and Rebekah Brooks, pictured in July last year, have long had a close personal and professional bond . Response: Labour MP Tom Watson questioned Rupert Murdoch's defence of Rebekah Brooks on Twitter . A friend told the Evening Standard yesterday: 'Rebekah acted as a foster carer for the horse. Anybody can agree to do this with the Met if they have the land and facilities to pay for its upkeep.' The Leveson inquiry into press ethics has heard that the relationship between News International and the Met was 'at best inappropriately close and at worst corrupt'. The inquiry also heard yesterday how the Met tipped off Brooks in 2006 about the original phone-hacking investigation at the News of the World, where she was editor from 2000 to 2003. She was arrested on July 15 last year as part of both Operation Weeting, which is investigating phone hacking, and Operation Elevden, the investigation into police corruption. Brooks is bailed to return for questioning by police in March. Her lawyer has said she denies committing any criminal offence. Day at the races: Rebekah Brooks, pictured with husband Charlie, left, at Newbury Race Course last year . Mrs Brooks' sprawling Chipping Norton home in the Cotswolds is not far from David Cameron's. Outbuildings or what appear to be stables are pictured in the foreground . It has been claimed that Brooks, who . resigned from News International in the wake of the phone hacking . scandal, was a horse-riding companion of Prime Minister David Cameron . but she denies this. Lord Blair said he was not aware of the gift. Brooks's spokesman, David Wilson, from Bell Pottinger confirmed the deal took place. 'Rebekah acted as a foster carer for the horse.' A Scotland Yard spokeswoman added: 'When a police horse reaches the end of its working life, Mounted Branch officers find it a suitable retirement home. 'Whilst responsibility for feeding the animal and paying vet bills passes to the person entrusted with its care, the horse remains the property of the Metropolitan Police Service.

Former Cabinet minister Lord Falconer said the 'much-too-cosy relationship' may have been emulated by police chiefs and other public servants who were then drawn into the Murdoch net. He also confirmed that policies were adopted to suit the political bias of the Murdoch press. 'I do worry now that we were too keen to curry favour,' the former Lord Chancellor said on Radio 4. 'It’s not remotely inconceivable that because the politicians thought it was okay to court News International, other public officials followed. I don’t mean the explicit corruption that Deputy Assistant Commissioner [Sue] Akers described yesterday. I mean the much-too-cosy relationships that were formed where... what went onto the political agenda or what was reported about what the police did was determined by that relationship.' The peer said that the appointment of former News of the World editor Andy Coulson as David Cameron’s media adviser was another regrettable example of over-cosy relations. He said Labour began courting NI because it blamed hostile coverage in The Sun for its 1992 defeat.

"By . Michael Zennie . Last updated at 9:36 AM on 28th February 2012 . Condemned: Robert Moormann's murder of his mother is one of the most gruesome and infamous in Arizona's history . In 1984, Robert Moormann confessed to smothering his mother while free from prison for a family visit and, standing naked in a hotel room, 'dissecting' her and hacking her body to bloody pieces. But as his execution Wednesday draws near, the story of one of the most infamous and heinous murders in Arizona history has become even darker and more bizarre. Moormann's lawyers claim the 63-year-old killer is mentally retarded and has the intellect and emotional capacity of a small child. Furthermore, they argue, the attack was provoked by years of sexual abuse by his mother Maude Moormann -- even while he was in prison. Prosecutors say before Robert Moormann dismembered his mother's body, he tied her to the bed in the Blue Mist Motel in Florence, Arizona, and beat her. He then suffocated her with a pillow. Moormann was free from prison on a 72-hour furlough -- given to inmates some to see family members or for conjugal visits. He was serving time for kidnapping a neighbor girl, 8, and trying to take her to Las Vegas in 1972. Along the way, he sexually abused her several times in dusty motels along the way. Prosecutors say he wanted to abduct and rape the girl's mother, but lost his nerve and took the child instead, according to the Arizona Republic. A jury convicted him of premeditated, unprovoked murder. But Moormann's lawyers tell another story. They say his mother, the widow of a well-known businessman from Flagstaff, had been sexually abusing him for years -- forcing him to perform sex acts on her. Maude was actually Moormann's adoptive mother. His biological mother, a 15-year-old hard-drinking prostitute, died in a car crash when she was 17. Troubled: Moormann was released from prison for a 72-hour furlough when he committed the horrific murder -- he was only caught when he asked to dump 'cow guts' in the dumpster of a local pizzeria . They claim it was in the midst of a performing a sex act on his mother, age 72, that Moormann put a pillow over her face to keep her quiet. Once she was dead, he went about meticulously trying to dispose of her body. He put her body on the table of the motel and cut it to pieces. He then carried the pieces to dumpsters around the town and disposed of them. He was caught when he arrived at a local pizzeria and asked if he could dump 'cow guts' in the trash bin behind the business. The suspicious owner called the police. He also stripped some of his mother's bones of their flesh and packed them in a box. He gave the box to a prison employee and said they were spoiled meat bones for the prison guard dogs. Adopted: Moormann killed his adoptive mother Maude. Family members say she was the only person who ever loved him unconditionally . All of this, the lawyers said, was the result of Moormann's severely diminished mental capacity. His psychologists, and even fellow prison inmates, have testified that beneath his gruff voice, bald head and over-sized glasses, Moormann has the mental capacity of a small child and still maintains an infantile affect and demeanor. Moormann's lawyers also cited his difficult early childhood in their defense of the killing. His mother gave birth to him June 4, 1948 at the age of 15. His father soon abandoned him. At 17, his mother, an alcoholic and a prostitute, broke her neck in a car crash and died. Moormann was passed to his grandparents, though he was soon removed to foster car because his grandfather was an uncontrollable alcoholic. He passed in and out of foster homes before being adopted at age 2 by Henry and Maude Moormann. Henry was reticent about adopting the child, but Maude's maternal instinct won over and the couple took him in. The Moormanns were well-known in Flagstaff. Henry ran a taxi service in town. But early on, family members told the Arizona Daily Sun, they saw trouble in Robert. He was classified as mentally retarded in school and given special education classes. When he was 13 he was committed to a state mental hospital after he shot his mother with a .22-caliber rifle. Moormann claims he was simply taking the gun out to show it to his mother and that it fired accidentally. Family members aren't so sure that was the case. When Henry Moormann died in 1967, Maude clung to her adopted son. In 1972 at age 24, Robert Moormann kidnapped an eight-year-old neighbor girl. Court testimony indicated he might have been more interested in the child's mother -- whom he wanted to rape -- but lost his nerve and snatched the girl from school. Prosecutors alleged that he sexually abused the child as he carted her off to Las Vegas. However, he was never convicted of that. Even after Moormann was convicted, Maude, now elderly, visited her son -- taking a bus more than three and a half hours from Flagstaff -- three times. It was on her third visit that Moormann murdered her in the hotel room where they were staying. It's a crime that still haunts her relatives -- even 27 years later. Rex Gilliand, a distant relative of Maude, who knew Robert Moormann briefly, said the convicted murderer was a 'throwaway' child who never got the attention from most of the people in his life that other kids receive. Maude was the only exception. 'The one person in the whole world who loved him unconditionally, he kills brutally,' Mr Gilliland told the Daily Sun.","Robert Moormann admitted to smothering his mother Maude in a hotel room they shared in 1984 .

About two thirds of the pupils are of Pakistani heritage,a quarter are Bangladeshi and the rest are of White British or mixed heritage. Pupils learning at Byron Primary School. New figures show just 57 per cent of children in the Bradford area speak English as their first language . It comes as new figures show just 57 per cent of children in the Bradford area speak English as their first language. All in all there are 140 different mother tongues spoken in the city and about 23,000 out of 54,146 youngsters use foreign dialects. Only London, Slough, Luton and Leicester have higher proportions of non-speaking English children. More than a third of children in . Bradford whose first language is not English speak dialects of Panjabi . with Urdu, Bengali and Hindko, which is the sixth main language of Pakistan, among other common mother tongues. There are also significant numbers of . pupils speaking Eastern and Northern European languages such as Slovak, . Polish, Latvian and Russian as well as other Asian languages including . Chinese, Burmese and Filipino. The information was revealed following a Freedom of Information request to the local authority. However, despite the challenges facing teachers at Byron Primary School, it is in the top 25 per cent of schools across the country. Pupils in year six, aged 10 and 11, achieved the standards required in English and maths, exceeding the Bradford and national averages. When the school was last inspected by Ofsted in 2010 inspectors rated it 'good'. Head teacher Richard O’Sullivan described the situation as an opportunity, rather than a problem. Head teacher Richard O'Sullivan described the situation as an opportunity, rather than a problem. He said: ‘The majority of our children start school with levels of English language development that are below national averages. ‘However, many of these children are exceptional linguists with the ability to switch between languages. By Year Six, thanks to fantastic teaching, confidence and ability in English have developed and the learning skills acquired as very young linguists contribute to pupil progress. ‘Figures last year showed children were leaving here in line with the national average for maths and above the national average for English.’ At Byron Primary School in Barkerend Road, Bradford, 93.6 per cent of schoolchildren use another language as their mother tongue . Councillor Ralph Berry, Bradford Council’s executive member for children and young people, said some schools were working hard to expose pupils to well spoken English at every possible opportunity so they could become familiar with the language as quickly as possible. He added: ‘There are a number of primaries that have had language diversity that have been rated good and outstanding by Ofsted and children leave with the required standard in English and maths. ‘The schools with the greatest challenge are those that have children coming in at different points in the year. I am aware we need to do more to get certain language skills into staffing. ‘We have been here before 20, 30 years ago and you need to work with it. I know it’s a challenge but these children only get one chance at primary education.’ Councillor Roger L’Aime, education spokesman for the council’s Conservative group, said it was essential children became fluent in English as soon as possible. He said: ‘All Bradford children by a fairly early age must be fluent speakers in English because if they are not it’s obviously going to be a limiting factor on both their education and job opportunities and their ability to become integrated members of the wider community.’ Councillor Jeanette Sunderland, leader of the council’s Liberal Democrat group, said: ‘The quality of the language they are learning is what matters. Parents need to take and read to their children at home.

"By . Rob Cooper . Last updated at 12:33 AM on 28th February 2012 . Probe: Rebekah Brooks is likely to be interviewed as a witness amid claims she was passed details of the original News of the World phone hacking inquiry . Scotland Yard tipped off Rebekah Brooks as early as 2006 about the full extent of phone-hacking at the News of the World, the Leveson inquiry has heard. Police told Mrs Brooks, then editor of The Sun, they were confident that private detective Glenn Mulcaire and the Sunday newspaper’s royal editor Clive Goodman were ‘bang to rights’. Detectives had established that Mulcaire – working solely for the News of the World – had hacked more than 100 victims’ phones and had been paid more than £1million by News International. The revelations were contained in an internal News of the World email read out at the Leveson inquiry yesterday. The revelation came hot on the heels of News . International's launch of the Sun on Sunday, to replace the NotW . which was shut down amid a public outcry. The damning email undermines News International’s claims – which they were still clinging to until 2010 – that phone-hacking was not a widespread problem at the paper but the work of Mulcaire and Goodman alone. It also exposed the cosy relationship between the Metropolitan Police and Rupert Murdoch’s News International group. The email, headed ‘strictly private and confidential’, was sent on September 15, 2006, by Tom Crone, the NoW’s legal manger, to the paper’s then editor Andy Coulson. This was after Mulcaire and Goodman had been arrested, but before their conviction. Mr Crone wrote: ‘Here is what Rebekah told me about info relayed to her by the cops.‘They suggested that they were not widening the case to include other NoW people, but would do so if they got direct evidence, say NoW journos directly accessing the voicemails (this is what did for Clive).’ The email also noted: ‘The only payment records they found were from News International, ie the NoW retainer and other invoices, they said that over the period they looked at (going way back) there seemed to be over £1million of payments.’ Mr Crone’s message concluded: ‘They’re going to contact RW (Rebekah Wade, Mrs Brooks’s maiden name) today to see if she wishes to take it further.’ Goodman and Mulcaire were arrested on August 8, 2006. On November 29 that year they pleaded guilty to intercepting voicemail messages left on royal aides’ phones and were jailed on January 26, 2007. The Independent Police Complaints Commission said last week it is investigating a senior Yard officer for allegedly inappropriately passing information about the 2006 phone-hacking inquiry to a News International executive. The unnamed officer, who was involved in the first 2006 phone-hacking probe, has not been suspended while the allegations are investigated. Scotland Yard have been criticised for failing to discover evidence that hacking went beyond a single rogue reporter in the original investigation led by Andy Hayman. Yesterday it was revealed for the first time that the NotW's publisher has admitted four journalists on the paper personally hacked phones - and that the practice was still going on as recently as 2009. The reporters, who have not been named, were apparently shown how to intercept voicemails by private detective Glenn Mulcaire, the Daily Telegraph reported. Clive Goodman, the former royal reporter, is the only NotW staff member to have admitted hacking so far. James Murdoch, the News International executive chairman, has repeatedly denied having any knowledge that phone hacking went beyond the single journalist. According to court papers, one journalist - known only as E - illegally accessed Kelly Hoppen's voicemail in June 2009. The revelations are contained in admissions made by publishers News Group Newspapers in court papers prepared for a High Court phone hacking trial. The case will not go ahead as all the people claiming damages have reached out of court settlements. As the hacking scandal engulfed the NotW last year, Rebekah Brooks was forced to quit her post as News International chief-executive. Launch: Rupert Murdoch is in London to oversee the first edition of the Sun on Sunday . Ms Brooks was editor of the NotW . between 2000 and 2003 - and editor of The Sun in 2006 when the original . phone-hacking inquiry was carried out. It was then that the police officer allegedly provided her with details of the investigation. The . officer works in the Metropolitan Police's specialist operations . division which handles protection for the most senior public figures and . deals with counter-terrorism operations. There is no suggestion they were paid for providing details of the investigation. Although the News International . executive who was passed details of the original investigation has not . been named, the Independent reported that it is understood to be Ms . Brooks. A spokesman for Rebekah Brooks yesterday refused to comment. A spokesman for the Independent Police Complaints Commission confirmed that they were probing the claims. 'The IPCC is . independently investigating an allegation of inappropriate disclosure of . information by a serving Metropolitan Police officer during the original phone hacking . investigation in 2006,' he said. 'However, as the IPCC has . made clear, there is no evidence to suggest that any inappropriate . payment of any sort was made to this officer. 'After careful consideration of the circumstances in this case . it has been decided that suspending this officer, who is based within . Specialist Operations, or restricting his duties would not be . appropriate. This will obviously be kept under review.' New paper: The Sun on Sunday was launched on Sunday as successor to the News of the World which was shut down last July at the height of the phone-hacking scandal . The IPCC launched their probe after . being called in by detectives working on Operation Elveden which is . investigating allegations of inappropriate payments to serving police . officers. The Leveson . Inquiry is hearing details of the complex relationship between . News International and the Metropolitan Police. Yesterday . it was revealed that News of the World bosses ordered emails that could . be used against them in court to be deleted in a bid to cover up the . phone hacking scandal. Hundreds . of thousands of emails were deleted on 'nine separate occasions' while . computers were destroyed and a senior executive ordered a staff member . to remove all paper records connected to them, it was alleged. The . fresh revelations came as News International launched the . first edition of the Sun on Sunday as a successor to the . defunct News of the World. Bosses have recruited celebrity columnists including Katie Price and Nancy Dell'Olio for its latest title, while the Archbishop of York and chef Heston Blumenthal will also have weekly slots. Rupert Murdoch, who flew into the UK to oversee the launch, had declared he would be 'very happy' if sales of his new paper exceed two million copies and enjoyed similar success to the NotW. The penultimate issue of the title, which ceased publication at the height of the phone hacking scandal in July last year, sold around 2.7 million copies. In a tweet yesterday, he revealed that the first Sunday edition of The Sun sold 3.26million copies. News International announced the birth of a Sunday edition of the biggest selling UK daily newspaper on Monday last week and Mr Murdoch has since said it sold out of advertising space. Bob Satchwell, executive director of the Society of Editors, said a new Sunday title would be welcomed by both journalists and the public alike.","Officer at centre of fresh probe has NOT been suspended .

"By . Rob Cooper . Last updated at 11:18 PM on 27th February 2012 . Scotland Yard conspired to cover up the true extent of phone hacking at the News of the World, it was claimed at the Leveson inquiry today. Former Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott accused police of a 'conspiracy of silence to hide the facts'. In a sworn witness statement, he suggested they withheld information after repeatedly telling him they had no evidence his voicemail was illegally accessed. Scroll down for video . 'Cover-up claims': Lord Prescott, left, and Brian Paddick arrive at the Leveson Inquiry which heard allegations that the Metropolitan Police attempted to 'hide the facts' about phone hacking . But as early as 2006 detectives had questioned private . investigator Glenn Mulcaire about the alleged hacking of the phone of . Lord Prescott's chief of staff, the Leveson inquiry heard. It was not until last year that Scotland Yard finally admitted that his aide Joan Hammell's messages may . have been targeted. The Labour peer has since agreed a £40,000 payout from the News of the World for phone hacking. And on a dramatic day, Brian Paddick, a former Acting Assistant Commissioner, said it was possible evidence could be 'covered up', in his own sworn statement. Questioned: Glenn Mulcaire was asked in 2006 why he had the mobile phone number and pin for Lord Prescott's chief of staff in documents . Mr Paddick said he 'found it difficult' to have 'confidence' in current investigations. He suggested that the phone hacking probe should be led by another police force. In his statement, he said: 'I find it difficult to have confidence in the current investigations, despite having the utmost respect for the senior investigating officer, Sue Akers, since the police are investigating themselves and are relying on the voluntary co-operation of News International in order to make progress.' 'It leaves open the possibility that should evidence severely damaging to both the reputation of the Metropolitan Police and News International be discovered, such as the collusion of very senior officers or those at the highest levels in News International, it could be covered up to the benefit of both parties.' Mr Paddick, who retired from the police in 2007 and is now a Liberal Democrat politician who wants to be Mayor of London, added: 'It is essential, in my view, that independent scrutiny and oversight of the investigation is introduced or that the investigation is led by a police force not so far implicated in the current investigations.' The inquiry learnt Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator working for the News of the World, was asked as early as August 2006 why he had documents containing a mobile phone number and pin for Lord Prescott's chief of staff. A Scotland Yard detective asked him: . 'Another page here, this has got the name John Prescott. There is . another name underneath, first of all it says adviser and then the name . Joan Hammell... Have you got that information to access John Prescott's . network or that of his adviser?' Mulcaire replied: 'No comment.' Despite this, when the Labour politician asked the Metropolitan Police in 2009 whether his mobile had been hacked he was told there was no evidence this was the case. Lord Prescott suggested police had withheld information from him. He pointed out that he had regular dealings with former senior Met officer Andy Hayman, who was in ultimate charge of the original phone hacking investigation in 2006. 'He (Mr Hayman) was the man I was working with, and he might have just said to me, ""watch your phone"", he said. 'I was beginning to feel they were hiding things, not telling me the truth.' Referring to the police, the former Deputy Prime Minister added: 'These are highly-paid, highly-intelligent people. 'I think there was more a conspiracy of silence to hide the facts and frankly I am stronger of that view in the last few months.' Mulcaire and the News of the World's royal editor, Clive Goodman, were jailed in January 2007 after pleading guilty to intercepting voicemail messages left on royal aides' phones. Lord Prescott also criticised the close relations between British politicians and News International owner Rupert Murdoch and his executives. He said: 'It's not exactly corruption, and I'm not accusing them of that, but they do have interests, they do have power. 'And in the Murdoch press, it's particularly organised to achieve that, so they have good relations.' Referring to Mr Murdoch, he added: 'He's not interested in the dinners, is he? He just wants what he wants - that is selling newspapers and influence over political parties and playing a part in influencing the politics.'","Lord Prescott accuses Metropolitan Police of a 'conspiracy of silence to hide the facts'

If you’ve ever visited New York City then it’s likely you had to put up with a noisy TV in the back of a cab as you made your way somewhere. But that could all change soon as a private company has proposed removing the current screens and replacing them with Apple iPad tablets. The screens were installed in 2007 and play local news and adverts, but the proposal from Square in San Francisco, California, could change that. Inside: The taxi screens were installed in 2007 and play local news and adverts, but the proposal from Square in San Francisco could replace them with iPads . ‘It’s all the same garbage over and over,’ taxi driver Orlando Morales told the New York Post. ‘It drives me nuts listening to this s**t.’ The bid and proposal for a pilot of 50 tablet computers in city cabs is being heard by the Taxi and Limousine Commission next Thursday. A survey last February revealed 31 per cent of passengers think current screens, which also feature local maps, are the worst part of a cab ride. Taxi drivers would not only benefit from . less noise, but also pay less commission when passengers use their . credit cards to cover a journey. The cabbies currently pay five per cent but this would drop to 2.75 per cent if the deal with Square goes through, reported the New York Post. iPad future? The bid and proposal for a pilot of 50 tablet computers in city cabs is being heard by the Taxi and Limousine Commission next Thursday .

A 21-year-old drunk woman who allegedly asked her also-drunk boyfriend to drive her home in her car could be facing up to 30 years in jail. Erin Brown allegedly wanted Trevor Bradshaw, 23, to drive her Toyota Scion in Nashville, Tennessee, but he fatally hit two young men and a taxi. She was a passenger on the night last December but, in a city first, has been charged along with Bradshaw with vehicular homicide and assault.

Diddy’ Combs released his first record 15 years ago. Now the sporting and music icons are both set to enter the TV industry by launching their own U.S. networks over the next two years. The ideas are bullish as celebrity networks are far from a guaranteed success, given the poor ratings plaguing the Oprah Winfrey Network. New ideas: NBA star Magic Johnson, left, and rapper Sean ‘P. Diddy’ Combs, right,  are both set to enter the TV industry by launching their own U.S. networks . ‘We'll learn from those who have gone before us,’ Johnson told the LA Times. ‘We understand the landscape and we will run a sound business.’ Former L.A. Lakers star Johnson said ‘Aspire’ will feature positive images of African-Americans, be aimed at black viewers and launched in June. It will ‘encourage and challenges African-Americans to reach for their dreams’ and ‘celebrate our heritage and achievements,’ said Johnson, 52. ‘I’m most excited about Aspire creating opportunities for the new voices, new visions and the next generation of storytellers,’ he added. Johnson - enshrined in the Basketball . Hall of Fame in 2002 - wants a mix of film, TV, music, comedy, . performing arts and faith shows on Aspire. Big idea: Ex-Los Angeles Lakers star Johnson said 'Aspire' will be launched in June, feature positive images of African-Americans and is aimed at black viewers . He also wants the 24-hour channel to . also offer opportunities for black people who have struggled to find . work in mainstream Hollywood. 'We'll learn from those who have gone before us. We understand the landscape and we will run a sound business' Magic Johnson . Johnson was a three-time NBA most-valuable player and his astonishing success on the court has almost been matched off it. The five-time NBA champion and communications graduate runs a charitable foundation and is chairman of the holding company behind Vibe magazine. Johnson may find strong competition in Black Entertainment Television, which is the most-viewed TV network targeting young African-Americans. Meanwhile Grammy award-winning rapper Combs is planning to launch the ‘Revolt’ network with MTV veteran Andy Schuon next year. Tricky business: The ideas are bullish as celebrity networks are far from a guaranteed success, given the poor ratings plaguing the Oprah Winfrey Network . ‘Revolt is the first channel created . entirely from the ground up in this new era of social media,’ said . Combs, once known as Puff Daddy. 'Revolt will be live, like all great moments in television history (and) immediate, like today’s social networks' Sean 'P. Diddy' Combs . ‘Revolt will be live, like all great moments in television history,’ he added. ‘It will also be immediate, like today’s social networks.’ It will have programming that includes music videos, live performances, music news and interviews and Combs wants to put artists in charge. The channels were both announced as part . of a package of four minority- owned networks being launched by Comcast . on its cable TV systems. Others include El Rey, proposed by . Hollywood director Robert Rodriguez and FactoryMade Ventures executives . John Fogelman and Cristina Patwa. Other ideas: An entertainment. channel proposed by Hollywood director Robert Rodriguez, pictured, is for Latino and general audiences . Rodriguez is known for the ‘Spy Kids’ films and the network for Latino and general audiences is being billed as 'action-packed'. 'I’m most excited about Aspire creating opportunities for the new voices, new visions and the next generation of storytellers' Magic Johnson . Meanwhile a fourth network is BabyFirst Americas, from Spanish-language TV veteran Constantino ‘Said’ Schwarz, for infants and young children. It will emphasise the importance of early development of verbal, maths and learning to perform movements, the network said. Winfrey's network has been plagued by weak ratings and internal shifts, and she took over as CEO last July in attempt to refocus its direction. There were attempts to get back ratings with comedian Rosie O'Donnell's show launched in October, but that soon lost half its audience to 200,000.","Johnson aims 'Aspire' at African-American audience .

"By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 5:16 PM on 22nd February 2012 . An ‘armed and dangerous’ mountain recluse allegedly responsible for more than two dozen cabin burglaries in the wilderness has finally been identified by police after eluding them for half a decade. Troy James Knapp, 44, has only just been identified three years after his fingerprints were lifted from holiday homes near Zion National Park in the Utah wilderness - and now police have to catch him. Authorities have compared Knapp to Davy Crockett, the 19th century Tennessean survival expert known as 'King of the Wild Frontier', and he remains somewhere in 1,000 sq miles of wilderness. Long search: Troy James Knapp, 44, has only just been identified three years after fingerprints were lifted from holiday homes near Zion National Park in the Utah wilderness - and now police have to catch him . Knapp is a virtual ghost in the woods, stocked with stolen gear, food and guns. Authorities have so far revealed little about him or how he ended up wandering the mountains of southern Utah. Knapp has family members in Moscow, Idaho, but they have not commented. Just last week, Iron County detectives said investigators hadn't made a definite identification but were getting close. However, court records indicate charges were filed against Knapp in neighbouring Kane County about three weeks ago on January 27 as the key suspect in the serial burglaries. Knapp's fingerprints from one cabin in 2009 were allegedly matched last month to a 2000 theft arrest in California. He was convicted previous on charges of assault with a weapon and burglaries. Mysterious: Investigators have found abandoned camps in the Utah wilderness, like the one pictured, dozens of guns, high-end outdoor gear stolen from the homes and rubbish strewn around the forest floor . ‘This guy is probably about as true a . survivalist as Davy Crockett,’ U.S. Marshal Michael Wingert said, adding . Knapp ‘dropped off everybody's radar in 2003 and nobody has heard from . him since’. Comparison: Authorities say Knapp is like Davy Crockett, a 19th century survival expert portrayed by Fess Parker in the 1955 Disney film given his name . ‘He just dropped off the face of the . earth,’ Supervisory Deputy Wingert added, speculating Knapp was ‘fed up . with civilisation.’ He faces counts of burglary and a . weapons charge. The Iron County Sheriff's Office said public tips and forensic evidence linked Knapp to the crimes. ‘This suspect is known to be armed and could be possibly dangerous if cornered,’ a spokesman said. The spokesman added that his identification was the result of ‘good old-fashioned investigative work, along with tips provided by the public.’ ‘We believe Mr Knapp is our guy,’ Mr Wingert said. Iron County Sheriff's Detective Jody Edwards said last week investigators were scouring for clues but getting close after they got the first pictures of the suspect from a CCTV camera outside a cabin. The photos taken in December showed a sandy-haired man in camouflage on snowshoes, a rifle slung over his shoulder. Detective Edwards has been working on the case since 2007. Knapp has allegedly eluded capture for . five years, breaking into cabins in winter, living off hot food, . alcohol and coffee before stealing provisions and vanishing away with guns and supplies. Discoveries; Cabin owners are increasingly scared and carrying guns themselves in a protection attempt . Cabin owners are panicked. Many said they . were carrying their own guns and had grown to wonder who might be . sleeping in their beds during winter. In recent weeks, it took detectives an entire day to reach a remote cabin after getting a report that lights had been seen on inside overnight. It turned out they were solar-powered lights on the porch, and the cabin was empty - another dead-end. But their break came in January with the fingerprint match. There have been no violent confrontations but detectives call him a time bomb. He has left some cabins tidy and clean, but others practically destroyed - defecating in a pan on the floor in one home. Lately he has been leaving the cabins in disarray and riddled with bullets after defacing religious icons. A recent note left behind in one cabin warned: ‘Get off my mountain.’ In the January 27 court filing, authorities said Knapp had left behind even more threatening notes aimed at law enforcement. ‘Hey Sheriff... Gonna put you in the ground!’ read one note. ‘He could stand in the trees and pop . you off and no one would know who killed you,’ cabin owner Bruce Stucki . said last week. When alerted of the latest news, a relieved Mr . Stucki said: ‘Wow.’ ‘That's wonderful that they know him,’ Mr Stucki added. ‘Now they need to get him in custody.’ From the beginning, the suspect's lore grew, leading to theories that he might have been two separate men on the FBI's Most Wanted List. It was even suggested he could be a castaway from nearby compounds of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, the polygamous sect run by jailed leader Warren Jeffs. Early on, investigators thought his unattended summer camps they came across during their search were left behind by ‘doomsday’ believers preparing for some sort of apocalypse. This was because of the remote locations and supplies like dozens of guns, radios, batteries, dehydrated food and camping gear. They now have a name, but the man remains in the mist. ‘He's scaring the daylights out of cabin owners. Now everyone's packing guns,’ said Jud Hendrickson, 62, a local mortgage adviser. ‘We feel like we're being subject to terrorism by this guy.’","Amazing story of Troy James Knapp who has 'roamed Utah wilderness'

Now the duo, who have shot to fame for their strong Christian faith as well as their amazing sporting ability, have become friends after speaking of their admiration for each other over the phone. New York Knicks NBA point guard Lin, 23, said he is ‘very inspired’ by Denver Broncos quarterback Tebow, 24, who replied that Lin is a ‘great role model’, according to Lin’s former Harvard chaplain. Friends: New York Knicks NBA breakout point guard Jeremy Lin, 23, left, said he is 'very inspired' by Denver Broncos star quarterback Tim Tebow, 24, right, who replied that Lin is a 'great role model' ‘They've spoken over the telephone,’ Adrian Tam told People. ‘Jeremy's been a fan of Tebow's for a while. His comment to me was that Tim is a really great guy and that he's very inspired by him.’ Lin met with Sportin Scarves CEO Kenny Blakeney last November and told him how he loved what Tebow was standing for, when many were imitating his prayer pose by ‘Tebowing’, reported People. Both Lin and Tebow hope to become pastors after finishing their careers and have been very open about their faith. Lin’s Twitter feed has the description: ‘To know Him is to want to know Him more’. Late last month he asked a chaplain at Florida’s American Airlines Arena before the New York Knicks took on the Miami Heat to pray that his arm would not get cut again, reported the New York Post. New pad: Lin, left now has a two-bedroom rental, right, listed at $13,000 a month, that is on the 38th floor of the residences at the W New York Downtown Hotel in Manhattan and impressively overlooks the Statue of Liberty . Tebow told ESPN earlier this week that he has ‘had the pleasure of getting to know him over the last few weeks and what a great guy he is’, adding: ‘I think he's a great role model - and I'm proud of it.’ 'They've spoken over the telephone. Jeremy's been a fan of Tebow's for a while. His comment to me was that Tim is a really great guy and that he's very inspired by him' Adrian Tam, Lin’s Harvard chaplain . It comes as a trademark war brews over the catch-phrase ‘Linsanity’, which describes the crazed excitement around the former Golden State Warriors player from Palo Alto, California. Since his breakout 25-point game against the New Jersey Nets earlier this month, there have been seven patent applications filed, including one by Pamela Deese, who is a lawyer representing Lin. The applications cover use of the phrase on everything from mobile phone cases and sunglasses to action figures and footwear, but a trademark can take a year or more to register. Tebow-mania: Lin said he loved what Tebow was standing for, as many imitated his prayer pose by 'Tebowing' The NBA said Lin jerseys have been the hottest selling shirts at its online store since his performance against the Nets and it will be selling more Lin-related good such as plush animals and bobbleheads. 'I've had the pleasure of getting to know him over the last few weeks and what a great guy he is' Tim Tebow on Lin . Lin famously used to sleep on the sofa of his New York University student brother Joshua in Manhattan’s Lower East Side - but he’s moved up in the world now to get a flat of his own. His two-bedroom rental, listed at $13,000 a month, is on the 38th floor of the residences at the W New York Downtown Hotel in Manhattan and impressively overlooks the Statue of Liberty.

"By . Mark Duell and Michael Zennie . Last updated at 4:22 PM on 23rd February 2012 . Unruly: Yazeed Mohammed Abunayyan starting shouting and trying to hit a flight attendant . Being physically suppressed by airplane passengers after he had been shouting 'Allah is great' was a fitting end to a very bad week for one unruly Saudi teen. The plane incident came just two days after Yazeed Mohammed Abunayyan, 19, was arrested after causing a 'Grand Theft Auto'-style police chase, during which he rammed two squad cars and tried to run down a pedestrian -- all while grinning wildly. He was out on $65,000 bail when he boarded the plane in Portland, Oregon on Tuesday, but that didn't stop him from getting into even more trouble. Abunayyan started screaming when a flight attendant asked him to turn off his electronic cigarette and began causing a ruckus on the Continental Airlines flight bound for Houston, Texas. Passengers say he started screaming, punching at the woman and singing or muttering about dead Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. ‘He was screaming: “Allah is great, Allah is great”. It kind of worries you when that happens,' passenger Nancy Haywood told CBS affiliate KHOU. Passengers said the man was unruly from the beginning of the journey after he was not given a seat next to his friend on Flight 1113. After the plane took off the man lit up - but when he refused to turn off his device, passengers jumped up to help the flight attendant. ‘Every guy that was in my area was ready to go,’ passenger Mark Foster told KHOU. ‘It was not even a thought. You can tell buckles were off.’ Taken away: The Continental Airlines flight from Portland, Oregon, to Houston, Texas, had only just taken off when Yazeed Mohammed Abunayyan ignored the ‘No Smoking’ sign . Arrested: After he was subdued, a crew member zip-tied his hands. When the plane landed, he was arrested and handed over to the FBI . The passengers held Abunayyan down . while the attendant grabbed plastic handcuffs and ankle-cuffs to keep . him subdued until the plane landed. The pilots turned the plane back to . Portland 20 minutes after it had taken off at 12:17pm and it landed . again at 1:17pm, reported KHOU. ‘Every guy that was in my area was ready . to go. It was not even a thought. You . can tell buckles were off' -passenger Mark Foster . Abunayyan and his friend were arrested and taken off the plane by police at Portland airport before it took off again at 2:05pm. The Transportation Security Administration said it was not a security issue. An FBI spokesman said the man will face charges. Electronic cigarettes, which contain a . lithium battery that heats up liquid nicotine inside to create a . harmless vapour, do not burn tobacco. However, Continental Airlines policy . states it does not allow ‘the use of electronic (or) simulated smoking . materials’ on flights, reported The Oregonian. Shocked: Passenger Nancy Haywood said others allegedly held down the unruly Middle Eastern man who was screaming 'Allah is great' Assistance: Passenger Mark Foster said everyone in his area of the plane was ready to help out the flight attendant and it was 'not even a thought' Before the fracas aboard the plane, . Abunayyan, a Saudi Arabian national, was visiting family members five . hours from Portland in Ashland, Oregon. On Sunday night, he allegedly led . officers on a bizarre, 20-minute low speed police chase that was like . something out of a violent video game, one witness said. 'It was like ""Grand Theft Auto,' Adrian Olesnyckyj told the Ashland Daily Tidings. 'Initially, I thought it was someone who skidded out because it was raining. But when the driver skidded three times: '… that's when I knew something was up, so I called the cops.’ During the chase, which never exceeded . 40 miles per hour, Abunayyan slammed into one place car in a parking . lot and then tried to run down a pedestrian. He then hit another squad car twice, before running his car into an embankment, according to police. Abunayyan's dome light was on during the chase and officers reported that they could see him grinning as he eluded them. He was booked on charges of driving . under the influence of intoxicants, reckless driving, eluding police, . two charges of first-degree criminal mischief, three charges of hit and . run, six charges of reckless endangerment, and two charges of assault on . an officer.","He started screaming 'Allah is great' when asked to turn off his electronic cigarette on flight from Portland to Houston on Tuesday .
