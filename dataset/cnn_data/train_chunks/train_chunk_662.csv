Cleveland kidnapping victim Gina DeJesus and her parents will watch as officials bulldoze and grind to dust the house of horrors where she was kept in chains for a decade. The city hopes to make the four-bedroom house at 2207 Seymour Street disappear, just three months after DeJesus, Amanda Berry and Michelle Knight were freed from unimaginable tortures inside. The search giant Google has already 'disappeared' the house on its Street View features. Searches for the address now show just a blurred box instead of the house. House of Horrors: The house on Seymour Street where Ariel Castro kept his victims for a decade is being torn down and ground to dust on Wednesday morning . Google has blocked the Seymour Street house from its Street View feature. It is unknown whether the search giant did that on its own or if it was asked to make the house disappear . It is unknown what will be done with the land beneath the house. The city of Cleveland seized the home and donated it to the Cuyahoga Land Bank, a non-profit organization that fights urban blight in the city. The Land Bank has not revealed its plans for the property. Felix DeJesus said he and his wife and daughter Gina will watch the house come down. 'Thank God it will be over with. And tomorrow I will be there to see this house come down,' he told WOIO-TV. On July 26, Castro - a former elementary school bus driver - pleaded guilty to more than 900 counts of kidnapping, rape and assault and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Defiant: Gina DeJesus (left) will be in attendance to watch the house be demolished, along with her parents Felix DeJesus and Nancy Ruiz (right) Ariel Castro has been sentenced to spend the rest of his life in prison after pleading guilty to more than 900 charges . Pictures emerged from inside the home of chains and restraints and makeshift alarms that that he used to keep the young women bent to his sadistic will. On Monday, authorities allowed Castro's children to enter the home and retrieve family photos and other mementos. Neighbors are happy to see the house torn down. 'I want things to be like it were, quiet and peaceful. But to see that house go down it really will be a relief because I am so sick and tired of looking at it,' Henrietta Bell told the Cleveland TV station. The land bank's president, Gus Frangos said that the organization is trying to keep away scavengers who might try to sell the rubble as what is known as 'murderabilia.' In 2011, a website that sells items related to high-profile crimes put on sale 1-gram packages of soil from the home of Cleveland serial killer Anthony Sowell before a city agency razed the house. Sowell was convicted that year of killing 11 women and was sentenced to death. His case is under appeal.

Wardour Castle is a very grand Palladian mansion surrounded by 40 emerald-green acres in a quiet corner of rural Wiltshire. Driving along country lanes from the nearby village of Tisbury, you could believe you have travelled back in time to a previous century. Wardour is one of the many country mansions that have been divided into apartments, but what’s unusual for a building of this size is that there are just ten apartments. Two of them – by far the largest and most spectacular – are owned by designer Jasper Conran, son of Habitat founder Sir Terence Conran. Within his central apartment, which covers the ground and first floor, where the grand public rooms used to be, is the centrepiece of the house, a curved staircase rising  60ft to a dramatic decorated rotunda with circular skylight. House on the hill: The imposing exterior of 18th century Wardour Castle which contains ten apartments . The castle was built in 1776 by Lord Arundell, whose family had owned the previous Old Wardour Castle, now a romantic ruin a mile away, since 1547. The family lived in the ‘new’ castle until the 16th Lord Arundell died without an heir during the Second World War. After a period of neglect, the mansion became a girls’ school but suffered inglorious extensions in the 1960s, and a tennis court was built on the Great Terrace. It was eventually sold to a developer in the 1990s, who got rid of the extensions, did a great deal of restoration work and turned the mansion into elegant apartments with the help of architect John Pawson. Fans of the film Billy Elliot will have seen some of Wardour’s interior, as it was used during filming as the dance school. Dream kitchen: The brightly decorated hub in Helen and Paul's apartment at Wardour Castle going on sale for just under £700,000 . Flooded with light: All the rooms in Paul and Helen's flat have mesmerising views of the idyllic parkland and Wiltshire hills and farmland beyond . The apartments are all completely different shapes and sizes, but their generous square footage means  that little of the grandeur of the original building is lost. Artist Helen Cowcher and photographer Paul Wakefield bought one of the three top-floor apartments 14 years ago. They were living in South London but wanted somewhere peaceful they could escape to at weekends. They knew someone who lived nearby who told them there was an apartment for sale in the castle. ‘We got very excited as soon as we saw it,’ says Helen. ‘It’s the most amazing building. As soon as you walk into the hallway downstairs, you get this fantastic feeling of space – you know that you’re in a mansion.’ Space, style and light are what strike you most about Helen and Paul’s three-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment. Ward of Wardour: Designer Jasper Conran has two flats in the mansion . The lofty ceilings, beautiful sash windows with deep recesses revealing the thickness of the walls, wide doorways, timber flooring and white walls create an elegant backdrop for Helen’s paintings and Paul’s photographs. ‘The building is Grade I listed so you can’t do anything structural, but you can decorate as you like,’ says Helen. ‘We prefer white walls and ceilings so nothing gets in the way of the architecture.’ They have added colour and texture with bright cushions, 1950s ceramic lamps and quirky objects they have collected from all over the world. The sitting room is a generous  28ft . by 25ft, big enough for five sofas and flooded with light from four . windows, two on opposite sides of the room. The dining room next door is . also 28ft long, though narrower, but there is more than enough space . for the huge rustic wooden table that could seat ten guests. All . the rooms have the most mesmerising views of the idyllic parkland and . Wiltshire hills and farmland beyond. From the master bedroom you can . take in the whole bucolic scene without even getting out of bed, as you . can from the roll-top bath in the spacious en suite. ‘We . have loved it here. It’s a great place for entertaining, and the . history is a big part of it for us,’ says Paul. They have bumped into . some of the women who were at school here, and have even met a woman who . used to ride her pony inside the house when it was empty. ‘It’s . also ideal because we can just come and enjoy the countryside without . having to worry about the garden or maintenance,’ adds Paul. ‘With 40 . acres, there’s no need for a garden.’ Helen, . 61, and Paul, 63, have decided to sell both their London house and the . castle apartment to buy a bigger place in the area, where Helen can have . a studio. The apartment is on the market for £695,000 with a 170-year lease. ‘It’s very quiet here because the walls are so thick that you’re not aware of anyone else in the building,’ says Paul. ‘People like their privacy but everyone  here is very friendly.’ And what about their famous neighbour Jasper Conran? ‘He’s friendly and he has a good sense of humour,’ says Helen. ‘And of course he has impeccable taste .  .  .’ www.struttandparker.com .","Apartment in Wardour Castle is on the market for £695,000 .

If you think the football season is only bad for your marriage, you may need to think again. New research shows that it is also bad for your waistline, your bank balance and your liver. The study has revealed which fans have the worst habits during the season. Eat that: Man United fans watched Wayne Rooney bend in a free-kick against Crystal Palace on Saturday . It showed that Arsenal fans are most likely to neglect their partner, with 63 per cent admitting they spend more time with their friends than their loved ones during the season. Manchester United supporters are the biggest lovers of takeaway food with 52 per cent saying they eat takeaways three times a week during the football season. The Diet Chef survey also revealed that Chelsea fans are the biggest drinkers – 48 per cent say they drink during matches and the average consumption is four pints per match. As a result, they consume 1,200 calories from beer alone during a match. West Ham fans have been exposed as the biggest gamblers – they have an average gambling spend of £25 per game. They are also the heaviest smokers – 35 per cent of West Ham supporters smoke on match days. Thirsty work: Chelsea fans would have needed a pint after watching their side lose to Everton on Saturday . The poll also revealed that Manchester City fans put on the most weight during the football season – 34 per cent believe they go up by one waist size by the end of the winter. Being married to a Tottenham Hotspur fan is not desirable - 23 per cent of Spurs fans admit to neglecting their sex lives during the football season. The beautiful game is also bad for family life. Some 38 per cent of male fans miss out on family days out so they can watch the game. Finally, 52 per cent of supporters give up trying to eat healthily during the footie season and 40 per cent ditch their exercise regime. Izzy Cameron, Nutrition and Weight Management Specialist at Diet Chef said: ‘It’s been really interesting to see just how much football means to the men of Britain and what compromises they will make for their love of the beautiful game. Worth a punt: West Ham fans enjoy a bet - but how many backed a goalless draw against Southampton? ‘The survey has shown just how easy it is to put on weight with many men not realising that this regular indulgence in snacks and alcohol can cause lasting damage. ‘During the footie season it’s easy to opt for the quickest and usually the unhealthiest options, but drinking large quantities of beer and eating takeaways can do a lot of damage to your health – four pints of beer amounts to almost half of a man’s daily calorie intake, that’s a significant amount when you think about how much will then be eaten as well. ‘It appears we could help male footie fans understand that snacking and enjoying the football doesn’t have to just revolve around bad habits, and that although you can enjoy yourself during the game, it doesn’t have to go on all season.’","52% of Manchester United fans eat three takeaways a week .

The proud owner of Diddly Squat: The Top Gear presenter has been granted permission to bulldoze the farmhouse to make way for his dream luxury home . Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson has granted permission to bulldoze a five-bedroom farmhouse in the Cotswolds. The 53-year-old had plans to demolish the property which is set within a 70-hectare plate approved, and intends to replace it with a larger house complete with a swimming pool and tennis court. According to West Oxfordshire District Council paperwork, the star plans to name his new home Diddly Squat Farm. Local authority planning officers granted the application under their delegated powers after no objections were received during the consultation period. A number of conditions have been attached to the consent, including that the building work is started within the next three years. Moving to the site from his present home in Oldner, near Chipping Norton, Oxon, would take Mr Clarkson several miles closer to his friend, Prime Minister David Cameron, who lives in the nearby village of Dean. The luxury home will also boast its own orchard and croquet lawn, as well as renovating a derelict barn to feature a snooker room and two more bedrooms. The new property will boast plenty of space for animals with existing stables in place and plans for a kennel and dog. Designed by landscape architects Portus+Whitton, the plans also feature a gravelled courtyard and five on-site car parking spaces for Mr Clarkson's fleet of luxury vehicles. Mr Clarkson bought the farmhouse in Chipping Norton in 2009 with plans to own quad bikes and grow his own food . His plans for the property include a six-bedroom main house complete with swimming pool, orchard, croquet lawn and tennis court as well as a renovated barn . An advertisement on property website Rightmove.com which has been taken down by the agent invited offers in excess of £4.25m pounds for the freehold on the farm and the land. The advert encouragerd prospective buyers to'fulfil the dream' and also notes there is the possibility to create a 'sensational party barn' in the 312-acre plot, which it states was available in its entirety or in four separate lots. In an blog post written on the Top Gear website in early 2009, Mr Clarkson said he had bought a farm in Chipping Norton and planned to whizz around on quad bikes with his children.

Ordering a chicken vindaloo is usually the sign of someone who has taste for very spicy food. It is also turns out to be an indication that their personality is also on the spicy side.

Spicy: People who like stimulating their taste buds with meals such as a vindaloo curry also have risk-taking personalities, a report shows . Researchers in the US tested 200 people to see how they reacted to certain adrenalin pumping sensations, such as standing on the edge of something or watching highly suspenseful movies. Dr. Alan Hirsch of the Smell and Taste Treatment and Research Foundation in Chicago says the correlation between risk taking and spicy food makes sense . They were then given a small amount of capsaicin - the active ingredient in chilli peppers - in a glass of water and and asked to swish it around their mouth. Those who said they liked the spicy taste were the same ones who enjoyed the adrenalin rush of risky behaviour. The test, known as Arnett’s Inventory of Sensation Seeking, was carried out by researchers at Penn University in Pennsylvania.

Dr. Alan Hirsch of the Smell and Taste Treatment and Research Foundation in Chicago says the correlation between risk taking and spicy food makes total sense to him. He said: 'There’s a long-standing hypothesis that risk takers are adrenaline deficient and that they take risks to get that adrenaline and feel better. 'So they’ll work with bombs or in other high risk environments and then they’ll feel normal. 'Similarly, when you eat hot spicy food, it gives you a little bit of pain and therefore enhances your adrenaline level.'","Researchers in the US tested 200 people to see how they reacted to certain adrenalin pumping sensations .

The number of estate agents has soared to a record high with one in four jobs created in the past year in the property sector, according to official figures. According to the Office for National Statistics, the number of jobs in the sector rose to 562,000 in the second quarter of the year, exceeding the 2008 peak and the most since its records began in the late 1970s. The figure was up by 77,000 compared with the same period last year . Property boom: The number of people working as estate agents in the UK has risen to record highs . A nation of estate agents: 562,000 people in the UK now work in the property sector according to the Office for National Statistics . The statistics suggest that Britain’s current growth is being driven by a new housing boom. The sector, which includes estate agents and property developers, is growing so quickly it has amounted to the fastest growing segment of national workforce in the three months ending in June. The total number of new jobs in the economy during the same period was 334,000. The data will add to fears that the country is heading for a house price bubble. Danny Gabay, director of economics consultancy Fathom, said: ‘We’re no longer a nation of shopkeepers – we’re becoming a nation of estate agents,’ Growth: The statistics suggest that Britain¿s current growth is being driven by a new housing boom . ‘I would certainly agree that the economy has turned a corner; my concern is about how sustainable this recovery will be, given that it is based on using government subsidies to encourage already over-extended households to take on even more debt to finance their consumption.’ Concerns over the housing market boom were echoed by Business Secretary Vince Cable who urged Chancellor George Osborne to rethink his Help to Buy scheme, which will provide mortgage guarentees for small deposit mortgages from the New Year. He told Sky News: 'We should certainly think about how it should come into effect; indeed whether it should come into effect, in the light of changing market conditions. Warning: Vince Cable, left, has urged George Osborne, right, to rethink his Help to Buy scheme which begins in January . 'We don't want a new housing bubble.' But Downing Street insisted that the launch of the scheme will go ahead as planned. The scheme was announced as part of Mr Osborne's budget back in March but has attracted some criticism amid fears it will drive up housing prices but not boost supply. The scheme will offer state-backed guarantees on mortgages worth up to £600,000 for buyers required to put down 20 per cent or less of the total price of the property.","Number of jobs in the sector rose to 562,000 in the second quarter .

"By . Chris Hastings and Ruth Bloomfield . PUBLISHED: . 16:00 EST, 14 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:00 EST, 14 September 2013 . Former Crimewatch presenter Nick Ross is at loggerheads with  his neighbours over plans to ‘substantially demolish’ his £17 million Grade II listed house. The veteran broadcaster, 66, wants to rip out much of the building behind the historic facade and replace it with a new six-storey designer home, which would include five bedrooms, a garage, a two- storey basement, a gymnasium, projection room, staff quarters and a wine cellar. Ross and his wife Sarah Caplin also intend to transform the exterior by adding a series of pergolas to the garden and a set of balconies to the house itself, giving views over their West London square. Nick Ross intends to develop this Grade II listed Georgian Villa to the dismay of his neighbours who say the plans are 'out of character' for the area . But local residents claim the  couple’s plans for the Georgian villa, which dates back from 1826, are out of character with the area and would impinge on their privacy. Ross’s ambitious plans for the house, which will be considered by Westminster Council’s planning committee on Tuesday, could cost more than £10 million to implement. But local property experts say the alterations could more than double the current value of the house to an asking price of about £40 million. The former Crimewatch presenter and his wife, Sarah Caplin, plan to update the historic property by installing features like a two-storey basement and gym . Last year it emerged that Ross and Caplin had sold another luxury property for £35 million – more than 40 times what they paid for it in 1993. The value of that house, which was bought by Saudi businessman Wafic Said, had been significantly raised by extensive renovations. But Ross’s plans for the new house, which he does not currently live in, could be rejected by Westminster councillors. The council’s officials have already recommended that the scheme be turned down. Their recommendation follows complaints from residents who worry the pergolas are ‘too brutal’ and that the basement development would set a damaging precedent for the area. Three neighbours have also warned that the balconies would give intrusive views of their properties. Christopher Wright, secretary of Bayswater Residents Association, accepts that the existing building is in need of renovation, but believes that the current design would be overbearing. In a letter to the council sent last month, he wrote: ‘We do not consider that introducing a  modern style of design needs to be out of keeping with the architectural style of the houses in the square, but the scale of the extension is very large and we feel will be obtrusive.’ Local Tory council member Andrew Smith said: ‘There are concerns about both the design of the proposed building and the implications for privacy.’ Ross last night insisted he was doing his best to address the concerns and that the plans would transform a building that was currently ‘unloved and unlived-in’. He said: ‘It’s always hard to reconcile different views on architecture, and most planning applications in central London meet resistance, which is why we’ve put this out to extensive consultation and made many changes as a result.’","Veteran broadcaster plans to renovate West London Georgian Villa .

"By . Matt Chorley and Becky Barrow . PUBLISHED: . 04:02 EST, 13 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:15 EST, 13 September 2013 . Mortgages should be made more expensive and harder to obtain in regions where house prices are running out of control to prevent a new property bubble, experts said today. The . Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) called for the Bank of England to use its powers to limit lending in specific areas where prices are rising by more than five per cent a year. But housing experts lined up to insist it was 'premature' to talk of a new boom, with some parts of the country seeing steep falls in house prices in the last year. Land Registry statistics for June house prices show how increases are concentrated in small pockets, with most areas flat, or falling . In an explosive move, RICS says urgent action is needed by the Bank due to ‘a growing risk of another house price boom’. It suggests the Bank of England could ban banks from lending more than 80 per . cent of a property’s value. It could also limit the number of years over which a mortgage would be paid back, pushing up the cost of monthly repayments. Crucially, RICS said the policy could be introduced . on a regional basis, if some areas of the UK are hit by rampant house . price inflation but homeowners in other regions experience the opposite. It raises the prospect of loans becoming more expensive in London and the South East to act as a 'speed bump' to slow rises in property values. Bank of England governor . Mark Carney yesterday signalled to MPs that he was open to moves to cool . Britain’s housing market if it began to over-heat. But he admitted that the recovery in house prices was not been enjoyed across every region. 'We need to be vigilant about this. There are big pockets of the country where there has not been any meaningful recovery in the housing market.' The . institution warned that if action was not taken to control house . prices, ‘another housing bubble, reckless bank lending and a dangerous . build-up in household debt’ could cripple Britain again. But . the move will draw protests from the generation of young people already . frozen off the property ladder by house price rises. Graeme Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: 'The Government is already subsidising mortgages in an effort to stimulate demand, and if the Bank of England were to step in and limit house price increases then the state would be pressing the brake and the accelerator at the same time. 'Policy makers need to recognise that we don’t need more controls on demand, we need fewer controls on supply.' The Council of Mortgage Lenders has also played down talk of a bubble as 'premature', adding: 'We are a long way from such conditions and we do not imagine that Bank officials are losing sleep about current developments in the housing market.' Matthew Pointon, a property economist at Capital Economics, said: 'The conditions aren't there for a new boom in house prices.' While house prices have risen slowly across the country, in London they have surged to levels higher than before the crash . Average house prices increased in seven of the nine English regions over the year to June 2013. The . largest increase was London where prices were up 8.1 per cent, followed . by the West Midlands 3.1 per cent and the South East, 2.9 per cent. But prices fell by 0.2 per cent in Yorkshire and The Humber and were unchanged in the South West. With an average home now costing . £170,000, nearly seven times the average full-time salary, the . introduction of a compulsory deposit amount – such as 20 per cent – . could make it even harder for young people to get on the property . ladder. Critics warn the housing market is . already over-heating, with price rises in each of the past seven months, . largely fuelled by the Government’s interventions. Grilled by MPs: Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England . Under two controversial schemes, both called Help to Buy, people are being encouraged to buy a home with a deposit of just 5 per cent. The second scheme launches in January. In Canada – where Mr Carney ran the Bank of Canada before coming to the UK in July – 100 per cent mortgages are banned and a minimum deposit of 20 per cent is needed if you are refinancing a loan, and 5 per cent on a new mortgage. Grilled by Labour MP Pat McFadden about what he would do about ‘an unhealthy acceleration in house prices’, Mr Carney told the Treasury Select Committee that a ‘more intensive supervision of lending’ was possible. One option is ‘some guidance provided in terms of loan-to-value ratios’, he said. The loan-to-value ratio is the figure representing the size of deposit in relation to the property’s value. For example, a £10,000 deposit on a £100,000 home gives an ratio of 90 per cent. But he added: ‘We do not have powers of direction in that regard, but certainly have an ability to observe and recommend if necessary.’ Joshua Miller, senior economist at . RICS and author of the report, said capping house price inflation at 5 . per cent per year ‘would discourage households from taking on excessive . debt out of fear of missing out on a price boom’. At . present, house prices are rising by 6.2 per cent a year, but rose  by . up to 30 per cent a year at the height of the boom a decade ago. Still a dream: With an average home now costing £170,000, nearly seven times the average salary, the introduction of a compulsory deposit amount could make it even harder for youngster to get on the property ladder . But in a recent report, the Council of Mortgage Lenders said: ‘Intervention to dampen buoyancy in some locations would almost certainly bear down on other local markets where activity is more subdued, unless carefully targeted.’ The number of first-time buyers getting a mortgage has hit the highest level since the credit crunch began in 2007 as banks are offering far more loans which need only a 5 per cent deposit. Before the credit crunch, there were 1,000 different types of 95 per cent loans. During the recession, it dropped to just three, but has rallied to 46. █ Mr Carney admitted to MPs that savers had been hammered by record low interest rates designed to encourage people to spend. He said thrifty savers and pensioners who have seen their nest eggs eroded by years of dismal returns and high inflation deserve ‘tremendous sympathy’. But he said holding the Bank rate at rock bottom ‘encourages spending rather than saving’ and that the rates – which have been held at 0.5 per cent since March 2009 – must not rise any time soon for fear of snuffing out the recovery. Simon Rose, from campaign group Save Our Savers, said Mr Carney’s comments amounted to: ‘Spend as much as you can, even if it means borrowing to do it and maybe it will ginger up the economy.’","Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors calls for ban on 80% loans .

Griffin's wild, matted hair, glazed expression and deep crevasses around her mouth reveal a sad decline from the relatively fresh-faced woman she was in her first mugshot on July 4, 2012. Now and then: Koretha Griffin, 37, (pictured right) following her arrest last week for drug possession in Austin, Texas. Her sad decline is evident from an earlier mugshot taken for drug possession on July 4, 2012 (left) Ravaged: Griffin, a former stripper, has had a litany of drug arrests spanning just 14 months. She is pictured right, on October 14, 2012 and ten days later on October 24 (left) Griffin was charged earlier this month with possession of drugs listed as Class B or above. MailOnline was awaiting a call from the Austin Police Department as to the specifics of the charge. Under Texas law, possession of 2 ounces or less of marijuana is a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by up to 180 days imprisonment and a fine not to exceed $2,000. It is far from Griffin's first offense and records show that she has a litany of similar drugs-related offenses. Griffin's sad story begins back on July 4, 2012 when she was charged with possession of marijuana. Her mugshot 14 months ago, shows Griffin with several face and neck tattoos but looking clear-eyed and fresh-skinned. In the following months, she has been arrested three separate times on drugs offenses in the Austin area. Each mugshot shows a marked difference in her appearance - her hair becomes matted, her face  deeply lined and her mouth more turned down in each mugshot. Although it is unclear what drug problems Griffin has suffered, her face reveals the tragic hallmarks of addiction. Her cheeks are sallow and mouth seems to be collapsing perhaps from missing teeth, making her appear decades older than her 37 years. Sad decline: Griffin's Facebook photos reveal the effects that drugs have had on her looks as shown in her mugshots . Exotic dancing: Kitty Kats 'one on one' strip club on a highway close to Phoenix airport . Griffin's Facebook profile reveals that the 37-year-old is married and a former exotic dancer. Her workplace is listed as Kittys Club, a small, run-down strip joint on a highway close to Phoenix Airport. Her interests include 'spending times with friends,' 'partying' and . 'staying up late', according to Facebook. The sting earlier this month led to offenses ranging from state jail felony to third-degree felony, with bonds ranging from $3,500 to $25,000, reported Chron.com. Spending time with friends: Griffins pictured with an unknown man, also described her love of partying on Facebook . Those arrested, ranging in age from 17 to 61, face punishments from 180 days in jail to ten years in prison and fines up to $10,000.

It says she was asked to obtain automatic weapons for a photo shoot. According to The Detroit Free Press, the lawsuit describes her experience at the 2012 Gathering of the Juggalos as 'a living hell,' including being relegated to using bathrooms 'often full with naked male strangers.' Pellegrini worked at Psychopathic Records in 2009-2012, then was fired.

Howard Hertz, an attorney for Pyschopathic and ICP, told The Detroit Free Press on Tuesday: 'The allegations are untrue. Ms Pellegrini was terminated for poor job performance. I can't comment further because the matter is in litigation.' Pellegrini initially didn't want to file the complaint for fear she'd be blacklisted in the industry, her lawyer said. He said she has since got another job but it pays 'a lot less.'

Chilling footage of the 'Facebook killer' who shot dead his wife then posted a picture of her body online and declared 'I'm going to prison' shows him calmly get his coat and phone and look at the body immediately after the shooting. Derek Medina, 31, has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder after he shot his wife Jennifer Alfonso, 26, six to eight times at their South Miami, Florida, home on August 8. He confessed the shooting to police, but claimed that he killed her because he was tired of suffering abuse at her hands. He is expected to claim self-defense. Smoke and debris: Clouds of gun smoke and debris can be seen on home surveillance footage in the Derek Medina murder trial, in which Medina, who has confessed to shooting his wife, has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder . The home surveillance footage, released yesterday by prosecutors, does not show the fatal exchange which happens out of the frame. But Medina claims he shot her in self-defence after she started hitting him 'several times with a closed fist,' according to police documents see by the Miami Herald. The video shows Alfonso in the kitchen at the sink. When Medina enters, the couple move out of the frame, but at one point Medina's head is seen flinching backwards. Medina claims his wife had grabbed a knife and he had disarmed her and put the knife back in a drawer, but then she started punching him. Moments earlier, Jennifer Alfonso, far right, was seen at the sink close to the entrance of the kitchen . Medina is seen coming into the kitchen shortly after Alfonso moves away from the sink. A brief exchange is seen in the corner of the frame, before the debris flies past the camera lens . Several clouds of debris fly past the frame. Police documents reveal Medina shot Alfonso six to eight times . Then the footage shows Medina leave the kitchen and come straight back. He told police he went upstairs to get a gun, according to the Miami Herald. Moments later white particles fly past the lens in several clouds, a sign of gunfire. Medina then walks out of the kitchen, comes back holding his phone and pauses in the doorway. As he walks away again the light from his phone is on. This is when, police say, he took the photo of the body. All the while Alfonso's ten-year-old daughter from another relationship was upstairs. She was unhurt. He then walked away from the scene, and came back with his phone, paused in the doorway, before walking away again, his phone light on . After calmly putting on his jacket, Medina then left the property, captured on a different camera . He then gets a jacket and returns to the kitchen entrance and looks again in the direction of the body as he puts it on. Calmly, he leaves the property. The next frame is of police and paramedics arriving at the couple's home. A Facebook post from Medina read 'Rip Jennifer Alfonso' alongside a picture of her slumped backwards on the kitchen floor. He wrote on his Facebook page: 'I’m going to prison or death sentence for killing my wife. Love you guys. Miss you guys. Take care. Facebook people you’ll see me in the news.' A tattooed Derek Medina, pictured in court on Thursday, pleaded not guilty to charges he murdered his wife - despite posting pictures of her body on his Facebook page . It is thought that Medina could argue self-defense in the case, claiming that his wife cut him with a knife before he killed her . Turbulent relationship: According to Medina's father, Derek and his wife got a divorce after three years of marriage, but then tied the knot again . Prosecutors said they will ask a grand . jury to upgrade Medina's charges to first-degree, premeditated murder - . which could carry the death penalty. Three . South Florida attorneys are now representing him; they took over from . the Public Defender's Office, which initially represented Medina. Medina . claims his wife was abusive. He wrote on Facebook: 'My wife was . punching me and I am not going to stand anymore with the abuse so I did . what I did I hope u understand me.' Medina's . lawyers have asked to photograph markings such as cuts and bruises on . Alfonso's body. It is presumed Medina will claim the killing was in . self-defence. The diary of . his late wife has also been been seized by police. Some entries are . happy while others highlight the difficult nature of their relationship, . the news service said. She . described the first day in their new home as 'beautiful'. She also wrote . of their relationship: 'When we love each other it's GREAT. But when we . hate each other we HATE each other,' according to the Miami Herald. She . admits she struggled with feelings of jealousy and believed he was . looking at other women. Her entries also reveal how she struggled with . her confidence and one one occasion 'negative thoughts and memories . plagued her mind'. Gruesome: Derek Medina was arrested after admitting to killing his wife on Facebook and posting a grisly photo of her body lying on the kitchen floor . According to the Miami-Dade affidavit the couple had been squabbling since they woke up on the morning of the shooting. At . about 10am, Alfonso was upstairs, and Medina threatened her with his . .380-caliber pistol. The shooting happened later when Alfonso was in the . kitchen. Medina's father, . Derek, to whom he confessed to shortly after the shooting, told the . Miami Herald: 'They are making my son out to be a monster and it was the . other way around. She pushed him to the point of insanity.' The victim's family however, described Medina as controlling, claiming that he pressured her to leave her job. One man, who would give his name only as Joe, said Medina was prone to violent outbursts. Domestic abuse: There is speculation Medina's legal team will claim the killing was in self-defense . Denied: A Miami-Dade Circuit court judge denied Medina bail earlier this month after he allegedly admitted to murdering his wife on Facebook on August 8 . He . claimed he once saw Medina threaten a woman with a gun after she . accidentally spilled beer, and said Medina used to stalk members of a . softball team they both played on. Medina was denied bail by a Miami-Dade Circuit Court judge. In . an interview with the local station WSVN, Medina's father, Derek Medina . Sr., said that his son came to him at around 11am Thursday August 8 and . admitted to shooting his wife. ‘He just said that his wife picked up a knife on him, and they had a big fight, and he shot her,’ said the father. The elder Medina drove his son to a South Miami police station, where the 31-year-old turned himself in. Concerns: The unsettling post left several of Medina's friends puzzled, asking him for an explanation of what happened . Derek . Medina Sr. said that the girl who was removed from the apartment . wrapped in a blanket is  Alfonso’s daughter from a previous . relationship. According to . the father, his son had a rocky relationship with Alfonso. He said that . the two had gotten a divorce after being married for three years, but . then remarried last year. Medina was a part-time extra on the USA Network show Burn Notice. This image was taken from the Facebook page identified as belonging to Derek Medina . Tragic twist: when police arrived at the couple's home, they found Alfonso's 10-year-old daughter and led her out wrapped in a blanket . The . wannabe star boasted online about his tiny bit-part appearances and . dreamed of fame that he never quite attained. He appeared only as a . background extra with his head-shaved and pouting in two episodes in . 2010. He has also . self-published a number of self-help e-books, one titled: 'How I Saved . Someone's Life and Marriage and Family Problems Thru Communication.' Alfonso was a waitress at Denny's.

During a visit to a facility of leading Indian drugmaker Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd last year, U.S. inspectors found that a black fiber embedded in a tablet may have been a hair from an employee's arm, according to documents seen by Reuters. That and other quality concerns led the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to impose an 'import alert' on its Mohali plant last week, saying the factory owned by India's biggest drugmaker by sales had not ensured manufacturing quality. Ranbaxy, which is 63.5 per cent-owned by Japan's Daiichi Sankyo Co and gets more than 40 per cent of its sales from the U.S., did not immediately respond to a request on Wednesday for comment on the FDA observations. Ranbaxy Laboratories at Gurgaon, on the outskirts of New Delhi. Shares in India's Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd dropped more than 30 per cent this week after the FDA issued an import alert . Ranbaxy manufactures a wide range of drugs available in the U.S. that fight Alzheimer's, cholesterol, pain, allergies, and gastrointestinal and cardiovascular issues. The FDA's action has dealt another blow . to an Indian generic drug industry battered by a rash of American . regulatory rebukes and as U.S. demand for generics grows, especially . under President  Obama's new healthcare program. The import alert issued to Ranbaxy prohibits it from making FDA-regulated drugs at the Mohali facility and selling them in the United States until its methods, facilities and controls are in compliance with good manufacturing standards. The unexpected import ban on the Mohali facility sent shares in Ranbaxy plunging by one-third on Monday, and comes just a few months after it pleaded guilty to U.S. felony charges related to drug safety and agreed to $500 million in fines. It brings under sanction all three of Ranbaxy's plants in India dedicated to supplying the United States, and followed FDA inspections in September and December last year. During one of the inspections, the FDA concluded that a black fiber embedded in a tablet was likely either 'tape remnants on the nozzle head of the machine or a hair from an employee's arm that could be exposed on loading the machine', the documents showed. President Barack Obama speaks at the White House as he faces another budget showdown with Congress. The Affordable Healthcare Act has seen an increase in demand for cheap generic drugs, many of which are manufactured in India . According to the FDA, the ban means that U.S. officials may detain drugs manufactured at Ranbaxy Laboratories facility in Mohali, India. 'The FDA is committed to using the full extent of its enforcement authority to ensure that drugs made for the U.S. market meet federally mandated quality standards,' said Howard Sklamberg, director of the Office of Compliance in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research in a statement. 'We want American consumers to be confident that the drugs they are taking are of the highest quality.' Ranbaxy had said on Tuesday it would . review the details of the FDA import alert and take 'all necessary steps . to resolve the concerns' at the earliest. 'The . USFDA had conducted inspections at Ranbaxy's Mohali facility in 2012, . resulting in certain observations,' Ranbaxy said in the statement. ' The . company believes that it has made further improvements at its Mohali . facility ... and remains committed to addressing all concerns of the . USFDA.' The Mohali plant, . in the northern state of Punjab, had not been making U.S. exports since . last November, when it voluntarily recalled its generic version of . cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor in the United States due to the . potential presence of glass particles in certain batches. The . FDA's ban of U.S. shipments from the Mohali plant was unexpected as the . facility is relatively new and accounted for 50 per cent of new generic . drug filings by Ranbaxy, said Sarabjit Kour Nangra, a sector analyst at . Angel Broking. The latest . action against Ranbaxy came months after the FDA imposed an import ban . on one of the plants of Wockhardt Ltd after inspectors found torn data . records in a waste heap and urinals that emptied into an open drain in a . bathroom six meters from the entrance to a sterile manufacturing area. Wockhardt . Chairman Habil Khorakiwala said this month the problem at its Waluj . plant was 'an inexcusable lapse, but we have taken swift and definitive . action, both corrective and pre-emptive'. The U.S. government has banned imports of drugs manufactured by a company in India. This stock photo is not related to Ranbaxy Laboratories or any currently manufactured drug . India . produces nearly 40 per cent of generic drugs and over-the-counter . products and 10 perc ent of finished dosages used in the United States. In March, India allowed the FDA to add seven inspectors, which will . bring its staff in India to 19. In . Ranbaxy's case, the FDA inspections in Mohali also found that a tablet . was not within the specified weight limit, the FDA inspectors wrote. Other findings by the FDA included use . of dirty glassware, spots and abrasions on the surface of tablets and . potential packaging line failure that resulted in unlabeled bottles sent . to pharmacies.

Shocking recordings of lone gunman Aaron Alexis's Navy Yard killing spree have been released by the FBI. They detail the moments immediately after civilian contractor Alexis had gone on the rampage at the naval headquarters in Washington DC, shooting dead 12 innocent victims and leaving 15 others with severe injuries. The 34-year-old's murderous spree went on for about 40 minutes on Monday, and was only brought to an end when he was shot dead by police. Killer: Recordings have been released detailing the police's immediate response to Aaron Alexis's spree . Response: The operator can be heard relaying details of 'multiple people down' on the fourth floor . Emergency: The officer says the suspect has a shotgun and promises an update on the building's location . In the first of the recordings, an officer says: 'We've a report on the fourth floor of a male with a shotgun, multiple shots fired, multiple people down. 'We're still waiting for the okay that the scene has been secured. 'We've acted to shoot him on the fourth floor. I'll get you an update on the building location. 'We've several people down.' At this point the telephone operator's voice is drowned out by background noise from police and ambulance sirens. The recording then cuts to a second operator, who says: 'We're on the scene.... now for the shooting. 'Patients are being transported in and out priority one to Hospital Eight.' The operator's next comment is not clear, although he appears to say the commander needs to be made aware of what is happening. He adds: 'We've a victim at New Jersey, and like I said, we're in and out of Hospital Eight, priority one.' Identity: Alexis was named as the gunman after he was killed using his fingerprints . Alexis was identified as the gunman who opened fire inside Building 197, the headquarters for Naval Sea Systems Command, which buys, builds and maintains ships, submarines and combat systems. He was working on the base as a a contractor for Hewlett Packard, and FBI investigators have said that he was able to legitimately gain access to the government facility as a result of that job. His security clearance was reportedly renewed in July. When he was killed, Alexis had three guns on him: an AR-15 assault style rifle, a shotgun and a handgun. He is believed to have purchased the shotgun last week in northern Virginia. FBI assistant DC director in charge Valerie Parlave said he was able to access Building 179 legitimately using the ID card he was given for his role as an approved tech contractor. 'He did have a secret clearance. And he did have a CAC (common access card),' said Thomas Hoshko, CEO of subcontracting group The Experts Inc who employed Alexis. Alexis was a Navy reservist from 2007 to 2011 when he was dismissed as a result of a series of instances of 'misconduct'. Witnesses described a gunman opening fire from a fourth-floor overlook, aiming down on people in the cafeteria on the main floor. Others said a gunman fired at them in a third-floor hallway. All 12 of the people he killed are believed to be civilians, while a DC police officer is among the 15 others Alexis injured. Weapons: Sharpshooters Small Arms Range sold Alexis a Remington shotgun capable of firing six shells without reloading . After the first shots were heard, calls started streaming into police and officers were on the scene within two to three minutes of those calls. Navy Yard worker Patricia Ward told said that she had been in the cafeteria when she heard what sounded like 'pop, pop, pop'. 'Everybody just panicked at first,' she said. 'It was just people running, running, running.'When Metropolitan Police officers arrived on the scene, the internal security team had already determined who was firing the shots and directed them towards Alexis. DC Police Chief Cathy Lanier said that from that point on, there were 'multiple engagements' between police officers and the suspect and their back-and-forth lasted for 40 minutes. The time span from the first calls being made about the shooter to the time when police arrived and began to engage with him was relatively brief, as Lanier put it at only seven minutes. Todd Brundidge, an executive assistant with Navy Sea Systems Command, said he and other co-workers encountered a gunman in a long hallway of their building on the third floor. The gunman was wearing all blue, he said. 'He just turned and started firing,' Brundidge said. Terrie Durham, an executive assistant with the same agency, said she also saw the gunman firing toward her and Brundridge. 'He aimed high and missed,' she said. 'He said nothing. As soon as I realised he was shooting, we just said, ""Get out of the building.""' Brundidge and co-worker Durham were in the Office of Naval Sea Systems Command on Monday morning when a fire alarm went off, followed by orders to leave the building.","Aaron Alexis was in the middle of his killing spree when the call was made .

A finance director has been jailed for two years after he stole £170,000 from his employer because he claimed his ex-wife was blackmailing him over his sexuality. Christopher Brown, 55, used the cash to pay off his mounting debts which he said he racked up to keep former wife Mandy Brown quiet about his secret life. A court heard that after she discovered he had been phoning gay chatlines, Mrs Brown threatened to out her husband unless he agreed to an ‘excessive spending’ spree. Theft: Christopher Brown (left)  has been jailed for two years for stealing £170,000 from his employer. He said he took the money because he was being blackmailed by his then wife Mandy after she discovered he was gay . It included paying private education fees for their son, hotel stays, a Florida holiday home and dining out, a court heard. Mrs Brown, who is aged in her 50s, . faced no police action and has said that she 'completely denied' her . ex-husband’s version of events. Brown, a finance director for . Dawson’s, a luxury goods firm in Bournemouth, Dorset, siphoned off . £170,000 from company accounts by paying 56 cheques to his own bank . account. His deceit came to light when an internal audit was carried out while he was on holiday. When confronted, Brown resigned and went to live in France where his new male partner had bought a bed and breakfast. Brown, from Lymington, Hampshire,  denied four counts of theft but was found guilty following a trial and was jailed for two years. Judge Recorder James Watson QC said: . 'You chose to siphon off cash from company business accounts to fund . your own financial expenditure. Employer: Brown worked for luxury electronics retailer Dawsons, pictured, for 23 years . 'I do take into account the pressures . upon your life - your own sexuality - and the shame of being unable to . admit to yourself your sexuality.' Bournemouth Crown Court heard Brown joined family firm Dawson’s in 1980 and worked there for 23 years. In 1997 his marriage deteriorated when his then wife discovered a telephone bill that showed he was calling the chatlines. Brown claimed he destroyed the bill . only for Mrs Brown to arrange for another one to be sent to them before . threatening him with blackmail. He said: 'She took exception; I was desperate not to leave the family so I got into this financial mess.' The couple eventually split up in June 2003 when he moved to France. Dorset police tried to persuade Brown . to return to the UK for questioning for theft but he refused and a . European Arrest Warrant was issued in 2009. Court: Brown faces prison time when he is sentenced next month at Bournemouth Crown Court, pictured . He was eventually arrested by French police on the warrant in October 2011 and returned to the UK in last April. Brown insisted he had only borrowed the money and had repaid £120,000 over a two-year period. Brian Sharman, defending, said: 'He didn’t believe he was acting dishonestly; some of the stolen funds were repaid. It was a very unusual set of circumstances; he was a loyal and decent employee for years.' As well as being jailed Brown was . ordered to pay £4,800 costs and the prosecution reserved its right to . apply for the forfeiture of his assets under the Proceeds of Crime Act. After the case, Detective Constable . Andrew Stuckes, of Dorset police’s financial investigation unit, said: . 'Brown was a trusted employee who carried out a systematic series of . thefts in order to satisfy his lavish spending. Only the stability of Dawsons helped it to weather the financial storm.

Illness: Billy Connolly is being treated for the 'initial symptoms' of Parkinson's Disease and had an operation to deal with prostate cancer . Billy Connolly was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease during surgery for prostate cancer, it emerged yesterday. The 70-year-old comedian underwent an operation in the US which was ‘a total success’ but doctors spotted signs of the shaking disorder. Parkinson’s affects 127,000 Britons and symptoms include tremors while the victim rests, rigidity of muscles, slowness of movement, unsteady balance and memory loss. Connolly’s spokesman revealed that, despite the setback, the star will continue with his work commitments. She said: ‘Billy has been assured by experts that the findings will in no way inhibit or affect his ability to work, and he will start filming a TV series in the near future, as well as undertaking an extensive theatrical tour of New Zealand in the new year.’ Fans were concerned earlier this year when Connolly – nicknamed the Big Yin – admitted he had started to forget his lines during performances. A show at the Waterfront Hall in Belfast in April was marred by forgetful moments where he asked the audience what he was talking about. At the time, the father of five said: ‘This is terrifying. I feel like I’m going out of my mind.’ Connolly is staying at his home in New York. Actor Bob Hoskins, also 70,  announced his retirement after he was diagnosed with the disease last year. Back To The Future actor Michael J Fox, now 52,  was diagnosed as a sufferer at the age of 30. Parkinson’s is a chronic neurological disorder caused by a loss of brain cells that produce dopamine. There is no cure and scientists have been unable to establish the cause. Happy couple: Billy Connolly and his wife Pamela Stephenson, who have three daughters. The Big Yin has two children from his first marriage . Successful: Billy Connolly, left, filming in Scotland in July and arriving at a Dublin stand-up gig in April . Parkinson's is a chronic neurological disorder, characterised by a deficiency of  dopamine. Actor Michael J. Fox and Muhammad Ali (right) are among the most famous people with it. The main symptoms are slowness of movement, stiffness of muscles and shaking. These tend to slowly worsen with time although the rate varies from patient to patient. There is currently no cure. About 5 in 1,000 people in their 60s, and about 40 in 1,000 people in their 80s have the condition. There is no cure for Parkinson's and scientists have been unable to work out why people get it. Symptoms can be controlled using a combination of drugs, therapies and occasionally surgery, but often more care and support may be needed as they progress. Sir Michael Parkinson, also battling . prostate cancer, helped launch Connolly’s career, inviting him to a . record nine appearances on his chat show. He said yesterday: ‘I spoke to . Billy before his surgery to wish my old friend well, and I’m pleased it . has all gone well. ‘I’m looking forward to seeing Billy back doing what he does best – making us all laugh.’ Singer . Bob Geldof said his ‘great friend’ – married to psychologist and . actress Pamela Stephenson – would not be deterred by his illness, . saying: ‘He’s helped me lots in my endeavours. 'Pam and Bill are great mates. He’s as strong as an ox mentally from everything he’s been through as a kid. ‘So I don’t think this will deter him from being that individual that we know.’ Former . television presenter Michael Barrymore added: ‘Thinking of you at this . time Billy, and the times you made  me laugh and will again. You were so . kind to me.’ Steve . Ford, chief executive at Parkinson’s UK, said: ‘One person every hour . will be diagnosed with Parkinson’s in the UK. Despite this, it remains a . little understood condition and we salute Billy’s bravery in speaking . out about his condition at this difficult time.’ Coming to his aid: His audience cheered him on throughout the show despite his gaps in memory during this Irish show in April . Old problem: Billy's wife Pamela Stephenson said her husband's heavy drinking in the early stages of his career has contributed to his memory loss . 'There are 127,000 people in the UK, like Billy, living with Parkinson's. 'Parkinson's can be a very difficult . condition to diagnose, as no two people with Parkinson's are the same, . with symptoms - such a slowness of movement or tremor - changing on a . daily, or even hourly basis. 'Many . people, with the right medication, continue to live a full and active . live with Parkinson's, but for some, it can be life changing and it is . vital that Billy gets the support he needs to live with this complex . condition. 'We wish Billy and his family all the best as they come to terms with this upsetting diagnosis.' The disease was identified by - and named after - Dr James Parkinson who wrote An Essay On The Shaking Palsy in 1817 which established it as a recognised medical condition. Connolly was the first superstar of stand-up, but also built a successful career as an actor, starring in a series of blockbuster films. The 70-year-old has also presented some hugely successful travel programmes, often  linked to his stand-up tours.

This is the map that shows the fastest growing cities in the country, according to a new report on GDP growth across metropolitan areas. Cities in Texas and Indiana are booming largely thanks to a booming oil industry, but metropolitan areas of Louisiana are going backward as the petroleum industries in those areas slumped, the fascinating report released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis on Tuesday revealed. Overall, real GDP in U.S. cities increased 2.5 per cent last year. This is up from an increase of 1.7 per cent on 2011. The highest ranking cities for GDP growth were Midland, Texas, with a boom of 14.4 per cent, and Odessa, Texas with 14.1 per cent GDP growth. Overall, real GDP in U.S. cities increased 2.5 per cent last year, according to the report released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis on Tuesday. This is up from an increase of 1.7 per cent on 2011. Highest growth is shown in dark blue and the worst performing cities are shown in mustard . Trade growth, both wholesale and retail, was widespread -- 363 of the nation's 381 metropolitan areas experienced positive contributions to growth -- and was the main reason Texas performed so well in 2012. According to Dallasnews.com, a resurgence in the oil and gas industry in the Southwest specifically led to the strong growth. Elkhart-Goshen, Indiana and Columbus, Indiana came third and fifth respectively on the list of fastest growing metropolitan areas, with overall real GDP growth of 11.4 per cent and 9.6 per cent. The stellar performance in the Great Lakes was down to the manufacturing of durable goods, which continued to spur growth across the country. Other booming cities in the top 10 include Bismark, North Dakota, New Orleans, Louisiana and San Francisco. The highest ranking cities for GDP growth in 2012 was Midland, Texas, with a boom of 14.4 per cent . The three cities where GDP shrunk most in 2012 were Shreveport-Bossier City, Louisiana (-11.1 per cent), pictured, Lafayette, Lousiana (-8.1 per cent) and Hammond, LA (-5.0 per cent) The financial sector also contributed strongly to the performance of many metropolitan areas. However, not all cities did so well, and despite New Orleans' growth, others in Louisiana slumped. The three cities where GDP shrunk most in 2012 were Shreveport-Bossier City, Louisiana (-11.1 per cent), Lafayette, Lousiana (-8.1 per cent) and Hammond, LA (-5.0 per cent). According to The Advocate, a drop in crude oil and natural gas prices during 2012 may have been a factor in the drop in GDP in Lafayette and Shreveport. Lafayette has been boosted by activity in the offshore oil industry, while Shreveport has benefitted from natural gas drilling in the Haynesville Shale, but that activity has slowed because of low natural gas prices. 'Oil and gas is so important to Louisiana,' Walter J. Lane, chairman of the University of New Orleans’ economics department, said. 'There's been a real boom and bust in Haynesville.' Other cities on the poor performing ranking include Kennwick -Richland, Washington, Sierra Vista-Douglas, Arizona and Idaho Falls, Idaho.","Overall, real GDP in U.S. cities increased 2.5 per cent last year, according to the report released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis on Tuesday .

"By . Vanessa Allen . PUBLISHED: . 15:47 EST, 1 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:54 EST, 1 August 2013 . Care: Andrew Marr required full-time care in the months after his stroke. His wife of 26 years said he was reduced to a 'half-paralysed invalid' When broadcaster Andrew Marr suffered a massive stroke which left him a ‘half-paralysed invalid’, his life changed overnight. Yesterday his wife revealed for the first time the huge impact his sudden illness had on her - and made a heartfelt plea for greater support for Britain’s carers. Jackie Ashley, 58, gave up work for six months to become a full-time carer for her husband while he recovered from the stroke which almost killed him. She told how ‘exhausting, monotonous and frustrating’ she found aspects of caring for him during his recuperation, but said it had also given her a better perspective on life. The mother-of-three said: ‘I am no Florence Nightingale and there’s no damn halo visible when I look in the mirror: this is just what any decent relative would do for someone who is physically disabled. ‘One stroke victim wrote to tell me he thought that carers for stroke sufferers all experience some kind of post-traumatic stress disorder. ‘I wouldn’t go that far, but it can be tough, and carers everywhere need support and breaks.’ Mr Marr, 53, suffered a serious stroke in January this year which damaged his left arm and leg, leaving him needing intensive physiotherapy. Doctors warned his wife he might not survive the bleeding in his brain and that if he lived he could be left unable to move, see, speak or hear. Following months of rehabilitation, he is now preparing to return to broadcasting full-time next month. While his voice and memory are intact, he said his walking was still ‘a bit wobbly’. Miss Ashley, his wife of 26 years, has also returned to her work as a columnist for the Guardian newspaper, and described the dramatic impact the stroke had on the couple’s lives. he said: ‘He went from being a super-energetic, fit, over-worker to a half-paralysed invalid. ‘His life had totally changed, but of course, as many kind friends have pointed out, mine had too... I had never been a full-time carer. ‘It is, above all, exhausting. It can also be extremely monotonous and frustrating for both the patient and the carer.’ Miss Ashley praised ‘brilliant support’ given to her husband from doctors, nurses and physiotherapists during his time in hospital. Challenging: Jackie Ashley said her life changed after her husband's stroke, and the support they were given in hospital stopped once they returned home . But she said the level of support for stroke victims dropped dramatically once they left hospital, despite an ongoing need for occupational and physiotherapy. She called for greater flexibility from employers to cope with the growing need for workers to take time off to care for elderly parents and other relatives. Around six million people, or one in eight adults in Britain are carers, according to Carers UK. Half of those juggle care commitments with work, but the demands of caring mean that one in five eventually have to give up working, according to the charity. By 2037, it estimates that the number of carers in Britain will increase to nine million. Miss Ashley, the daughter of Labour peer Lord Ashley of Stoke, the first deaf MP, said many people became carers ‘out of the blue’ after an illness or accident left a relative needing help. She said: ‘The world of work is not set up to deal with this. Too many older women lose their jobs after a few months off to care for an elderly parent, or other relative. Return: Andrew Marr is due to resume full-time broadcasting in September . ‘Just as we now accept that women need to take some time out for childcare, surely we should be able to re-arrange the world of work so that “carer’s leave” becomes a normal part of all our lives, men included.’ Carers UK chief executive Heléna Herklots (corr) said a recent study had found the cost to the economy of carers who were forced to give up work was around £1.3billion per year. One in seven employees currently juggles full-time work with a care commitment, she said. She added: ‘As the population ages more and more of us will become carers. This is one of society’s biggest challenges. ‘If people are forced to give up work there’s a loss to the economy because they may need benefits and support, and they won’t be paying taxes. ‘If employers can support people to carry on working then they are not losing valuable employees, and they don’t have to recruit to replace them.’ Mr Marr has spoken movingly of the support he has received from his wife and their children Harry, 23, Isabel, 21, and 18-year-old Emily, saying: ‘Jackie saved my life. Without her, I wouldn’t be here... I was saved by my family.’ He also said he was happier since the stroke, as it had given him a better perspective on his previously ‘brittle, narrow, overstressed life’. Miss Ashley said it had also changed her attitudes, saying: ‘I have become aware of just how fragile life is. ‘We walk in the sunlight, ignoring the shadows. In the blink of an eye lives can be changed utterly... There is nothing like a near-death experience to put life’s little annoyances into perspective and to learn to live each day for the day.’","Jackie Ashley, 58, stopped working for six months to care for her husband .

"By . David Martosko In Washington . PUBLISHED: . 15:48 EST, 18 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:22 EST, 18 September 2013 . Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has testified multiple times in congressional hearings about Benghazi, but as a presidential run looms, Republicans are sharpening their knives for more Capitol Hill visits . Republicans are mulling whether to demand former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's return to Capitol Hill to face more tough questions about her agency's failure to protect diplomats and security staff in Benghazi, Libya a year ago. An aide to a high-ranking GOP member of the House Oversight and Government Affairs committee told MailOnline that the committee's chairman, California Rep. Darrell Issa, 'is dead serious' about raking the likely 2016 presidential candidate over the coals in the future. 'Look, it's not like we're getting great answers from the deputies and under secretaries,' the staffer said on Wednesday. 'So eventually you have to climb the ladder and swear Hillary in again.' 'I'm not saying ""The fish stinks from the head,"" or anything like that,' the aide cautioned. 'Just that the committee leaders on our side want answers and they're not going to let up.' Issa told the Fox News Channel on Wednesday morning that his committee won't hesitate to bring back any of the senior-level witnesses who have already testified about the September 11, 2012 terror attack on American diplomatic facilities in the eastern Libya port city. And that includes Hillary Clinton. 'We can certainly have Mrs. Clinton back,'  Issa told Fox. 'We want to be respectful of her time, so getting to the facts – including people below her – first is critical.' An oversight committee spokesperson declined to comment on the record about how likely it was that Issa could actually call Clinton as a witness again. But as the 2016 presidential election draws nearer, the knives may come out in earnest. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Terrorists linked with al-Qaeda attacked the U.S. diplomatic compound and a nearby CIA annex in Benghazi, Libya on Sept. 11, 2012, killing four men including the U.S. ambassador . House Oversight & Government Reform Committee Chairman Rep. Darrell Issa (R) could choose to call Hillary Clinton back to face more grilling, over the likely objection of ranking Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings (L) Clinton is widely seen as the Democratic Party's presidential standard-bearer going into the 2016 election. Embarrassing her as the presidential campaign season gets underway could be a devastating political chess move, but it's unclear how long Republicans will wait to pull the trigger if they decide to recall her as a witness. GOP Sen. Rand Paul, another likely presidential contender, has already said that mishandling of Benghazi under Clinton's State Department leadership 'should preclude her from holding higher office.' Paul said in August that he wasn't certain 'Clinton [was] telling the truth' about the nature of the CIA annex that also came under attack. He said he suspects it was involved with providing arms to Syrian rebels fighting the dictator Bashar al-Assad. 'The New York Times has also said the CIA has been involved with procuring arms to the Islamic rebels in Syria for over a year. What was the CIA annex doing there?' he said in August, referring to the Benghazi complex. 'I have asked specifically to have her brought back and I hope Chairman Issa will bring her back. She needs to testify under oat. Did she know about this and did it have anything to do with the misdirection campaign? And did she have anything to do with not allowing the Marines to go aid their wounded brothers there in Benghazi?' If she were to come back to face more questions, a Capitol Hill staffer explained, Republicans would likely steer clear of Syria links and focus instead on any involvement Clinton had in approving the security arrangements for embassies and consulates in some of the world's most dangerous places. Protesters gathered outside the National Constitution Center on Sept. 10 as Clinton received the Liberty Medal, given annually to an individual who 'displays courage and conviction while striving to secure liberty for people worldwide' Republicans may relish the possibility of firing more tough questions at Clinton as she readies for a White House run, but such a strategy could backfire on the GOP and create powerful sound bites for Democrats . Republicans would also likely grill . her about precisely when she learned what the U.S. intelligence . community knew almost instantly – that terrorists, not Muslim . protesters, set fires and fired mortars into the Benghazi compound and a . nearby CIA annex. Lastly, . Republicans want to know whether Clinton had a personal hand in . rewriting a series of CIA talking points that her agency softened . significantly in the early, foggy post-Benghazi days. Republicans, . including Issa, have been intensely critical of Clinton, even before . she began exploring a White House run, for what they perceive as her . role in a cover-up during the weeks between the Benghazi attack and . Barack Obama's 2012 presidential re-election. U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens was killed during the Benghazi attack, along with three other U.S. personnel . The . intelligence community initially rendered a frank assessment that . Benghazi was attacked by jihadi groups including the militant, . al-Qaeda-linked Libyan organization Ansar al-Sharia. But . after State Department-led massaging, it became a weaker series of . statements that protected the Obama administration while the president . was campaigning for re-election by claiming that 'al-Qaeda is on the . run.' Then-United Nations . Ambassador Susan Rice claimed days later in five broadcast interviews . that the attack was the result of a spontaneous protest following the . online publication of a crude American-made YouTube video that mocked . the Muslim prophet Muhammad. Obama later promoted Rice to the position of national security adviser. Clinton famously appeared in a Senate hearing on January 23, sparring with Wisconsin GOP Sen. Ron Johnson about the State Department's evolving storyline as the dust settled on the terror attack. 'With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans,' Clinton lectured. 'Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night decided to go kill some Americans?' 'What difference at this point does it make?' she asked. 'It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again.' On Wednesday the House Foreign Affairs Commiittee heard from State Department Under Secretary for Management Patrick Kennedy, who approved a plan in December 2011 to outfit the Benghazi post with what turned out to be inadequate and substandard security protection. After the attack, a formal review determined that no senior State officials were responsible. 'Turmoil,' not 'terror': News broadcasters followed Susan Rice's lead on Sept. 16, 2012 as she said during five separate interviews that the Benghazi attack was the product of a protest gone bad -- despite intelligence that showed otherwise from the beginning . Under Secretary Patrick Kennedy (L) faced aggressive questioning Wednesday from Rep. Ed Royce (R) over the State Department's failure to fire anyone following the terror attack in Libya . The final report, issued by an . Accountability Review Board, also found Kennedy blameless, despite his . signature on the 'action plan' that formalized the level of armed . security details present in Benghazi. Foreign . Affairs Committee Chair Ed Royce, a California Republican, asked . Kennedy during Wednesday's hearing to explain why no State Department . employees had been terminated after terrorists killed U.S. Ambassador . Chris Stevens and three other U.S. personnel. 'No State Department personnel have been fired or even disciplined,' Royce barked. 'No one has missed a paycheck.' Florida GOP Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen later suggested that the State Department is engaging in a slow-roll cover-up by 'merely shuffl[ing] the deck chairs.' State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki parried reporters' challenges on Tuesday, insisting that she would not address 'internal deliberations' related to the Benghazi diplomatic station. Kennedy said that four State Department officials, none of them at senior levels, were placed on administrative leave three months after the attack, and were since moved into positions that don't afford them 'worldwide decision-making authority for security.' 'Accountability includes being relieved of your job and assigned to other positions,' Kennedy insisted. 'To me, that is serious accountability.' 'Reassignment just doesn’t cut it,' Royce retorted. Then-Secretary Clinton and President Obama both said early on that a protest -- not a terror attack -- was the root cause of the deaths and destruction in Libya . Devastation: The mortar, small-arms and firebomb attack left America's diplomatic station in ruins . Secretary of State John Kerry made . news in August when he reinstated all four of those employees, following . an internal determination that 'no employee breached their duty or . should be fired' as a consequence of the Benghazi attack. Kennedy . also said that one reason U.S. law enforcement has yet to make arrests . in the Benghazi case is that the Libyan government hasn't permitted it. 'Yes, . they will let journalists in, but they are not letting U.S. law . enforcement in to arrest people there,' Kennedy conceded, 'because the . government of Libya is not in control to that degree.' The under secretary has testified previously that he was not involved with day-to-day decisions related to the State Department's Benghazi compound. While the Accountability Review Board interviewed him at length, it allegedly never spoke with then-Secretary Clinton. Before Wednesday's hearing, Republican oversight committee staff finalized a report alleging that the Board specifically aimed to protect political appointees at State while assigning responsibility for the terror-attack debacle to lower-level career civil servants. Secretary of State John Kerry determined in August that all four employees who were placed on probation after the Benghazi attack could return to full-time duties in different jobs . On Thursday, Accountability Review Board co-chairs Admiral Mike Mullen and Thomas Pickering, a former diplomat, will testify before Issa's Committee on Oversight and Government Affairs. Mark Sullivan, a former Secret Service director, will also testify. He headed an independent security panel that the Board asked to examine how some of America's most vulnerable overseas posts have been left with inadequate protection. The House Armed Services Committee panel will hear testimony later in the day covering the U.S. military's level of preparedness to respond if Benghazi-style terror attacks become the norm in the future.","A Republican aide says House investigators may 'have to climb the ladder and swear Hillary in' since underlings aren't providing answers .

A mother who drowned her two young children in a bathtub in Canada has jumped to her death from a bridge in Australia just months after being released. Allyson McConnell, 35, was deported back to her native Australia in April after serving just 10 months in Alberta for the killings of two-year-old Connor and 10-month-old Jayden in 2010. On Wednesday, McConnell's Canadian lawyer said police were in little doubt the body found beneath the Brain McGowan Bridge in West Gosford was his former client, as she had identification papers with her. The body was found washed up on some rocks by a passerby at 11am local time on Tuesday. Police said that a former identification would be released on Friday. Tragedy: Allyson McConnell, who drowned her sons Connor and Jayden (pictured with her ex-husband Curtis McConnell) has reportedly jumped to her death from a bridge in her native Australia . McConnell, who had suffered from a long history of depression and suicide attempts, had previously said she did not want to get well and would continue to try to take her life. Her murdered sons were found by their father, Curtis McConnell, in their home in 2010. At the time, the couple was going through an acrimonious divorce and custody battle. The day the boys were found, McConnell seriously injured herself jumping . off a freeway overpass. At the trial last year, a judge found McConnell not guilty of the second-degree murder of her young sons but guilty of their manslaughter, and sentenced her to six years in prison. McConnell spent just 10 months in the Alberta hospital psychiatric ward after the courts reduced the length for time served. Withdrawn: McConnell, 53, is pictured in Sydney after she was deported from Canada in April . Keeping quiet: After arriving back in the country, she stayed with her mother and was largely reclusive . Appeals were lodged against the verdict and sentence, and her husband had said he hoped she would be forced to stay in Canada until they were heard - but she was deported. She was pictured ashen faced as she arrived in the airport in Sydney earlier this year and returned to her mother's home in Gosford. Peter Royal, the lawyer who represented McConnell in Canda, said he spoke with McConnell's mother early Wednesday morning, CBC reported. He said the news was 'very depressing' and that he remembered her as vulnerable. 'I won't ever forget the evidence she gave in court,' he said. 'It was very moving and upsetting. She didn't see any future and believed she would continue to try to kill herself.' Missed: Two-year-old Connor and 10-month-old Jayden were found in the bathtub by their father . Ill: McConnell tried to kill herself on the day the bodies were found but survived jumping from a bridge . Happier days: Curtis McConnell still lives in Alberta and had been fighting for his ex-wife to face greater penalties . Robert Ovadia, a senior reporter with Seven News in Sydney, told CBC that McConnell had been reclusive since arriving in Australia. 'She hasn't been on any sort of watch list from authorities or any sort of scrutiny whatsoever,' Ovadia said. 'Her history of suicide attempts is obviously very well-documented. I'm told that she has expressed suicidal thoughts since arriving home as well. So as sad as it to say, I guess that today seems somewhat of an inevitable conclusion.' McConnell had said in court that her . suicide attempts began when she became pregnant by her father when she . was 15. She later suffered a miscarriage and told no one about it, she . said. Scene: She jumped from the Brian McGowan Bridge in West Gosford and her body was found by a passerby . A psychiatrist had testified McConnell had likely meant to kill herself, but was so close to her children that she considered their lives extensions of her own, CBC reported. 'Mental illness makes victims of all,' Alberta's deputy premier, Thomas Lukaszuk, tweeted on Tuesday evening. 'Sad . end to what already was a tragedy.'","Allyson McConnell, 35, killed Connor, 2, and Jayden, 10 months, in 2010 .

Plans to film the third series of hit TV show Homeland in Israel have been cancelled over concerns about the political situation in Syria. Makers of the drama starring Damian Lewis and Claire Danes had intended to film parts of the show's third season in Israel, where parts of the first two seasons were shot. But at the weekend the American producers told the Israeli production company that was arranging locations and shoots that they would be filming in Morocco instead because of security fears. Homeland, starring (L-R) Damian Lewis, Claire Danes and Mandy Patinkin, will not now be shot in Israel . Fears of a Syrian retaliation over potential military action by the U.S. have been growing in Israel in recent weeks, and there have been reports of nervous civilians buying gas masks and preparing air raid shelters. Morocco is seen as a more stable location, and Homeland's creators Howard Gordon and Gideon Raff are working on another project, a separate series called Tyrant, that is also due to be filmed there. But the last minute decision - Homeland executives announced plans to film in Tel Aviv only two months ago - has upset television producers in Israel. One source told Israeli news source Ynet: 'We were already getting organized, we even received scripts, and in the end we were told that the shooting had been moved. It's frustrating.' The Israeli production company is expected to be tens of thousands of dollars out of pocket as a result to cancel filming in Tel Aviv. The third series will begin in the U.S. later this month and will be aired in the UK in October. Homeland producers were criticised by Lebanese tourist officials a year ago over their portrayal of 'Beirut' as a terrorist-ridden slum which they said was far from the truth . Makers of the Emmy Award-winning show were criticised a year ago by Lebanese tourism officials for portraying Beirut as a city packed with terrorists. Faty Abboud, the minister for tourism, threatened legal action after an episode in the second series showed a part of the city looking shoddy and dangerous, when in fact it is filled with luxury boutiques. To make matters worse, the episode had been filmed in Israel, rather than Beirut.  Gideon Raff, director and screenwriter, is Israeli and therefore unable to enter Lebanon.","Show starring Damian Lewis and Claire Danes will now be shot in Morocco .

Couple: JK Rowling and her husband Neil Murray at the Odeon Leicester Square in London in 2009 . She is worth £560million and is behind one of the world’s most successful book and film series. But JK Rowling - who has daughters Jessica, 20, and Mackenzie, eight, and son David, ten - insisted today that she is prouder of her years as a single mother than any other part of her life. The 48-year-old Harry Potter author, who married Neil, 42, in 2001, said that Jessica - who she had with first husband Jorge - recently told her of the first five years of her life: ‘I never knew we were poor. I just remember being happy.’ The author - whose real name is Joanne Rowling - separated from Jorge 20 years ago, and said when she was a single mother with Jessica she would work a few hours a week at a local church. Miss Rowling, writing on the website of single-parent charity Gingerbread, said:  ‘It was slowly dawning on me that I was now defined, in the eyes of many, by something I had never chosen. ‘I was a “single parent”, and a “single parent on benefits” to boot. Patronage was almost as hard to bear as stigmatisation.’ She said one woman even referred to her as ‘the unmarried mother’. Miss Rowling added there were 'assumptions made about your morals, your motives for bringing your child into the world or your fitness to raise that child cut to the core of who you are’. She said that a 2011 survey by the charity, for which she is president, found that 87 per cent of single parents feel there is a stigma around single parenthood that must be challenged. The author added in the Gingerbread article: ‘I find the language of ""skivers versus strivers"" particularly offensive when it comes to single parents, who are already working around the clock to care for their children. ‘ . Miss Rowling said that when she was a single mother, it was a ‘much bigger delusion’ to believe that she could get back into paid work - than the children’s novel she was working on might be published.

With the stars: (Left-to-right) Daniel Radcliffe, JK Rowling, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint at the world premiere of Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows: Part 2 - the final film in the wizard series - in 2011 .

Beasts And Where To Find Them is the first in a planned series inspired . by the textbook of the same name given to Hogwarts pupils and will . feature its fictitious author, Newt Scamander.

The donation to the National Council for One Parent Families (now Gingerbread) was described by the charity as 'staggering' Earlier this year, Rowling was unmasked as the author of a crime novel, The Cuckoo’s Calling, written and published under the pseudonym of Robert Galbraith. 'I am prouder of my years as a single mother than of any other part of my life' JK Rowling . The book, which sold about 8,500 copies before she was named as the author, has since become a worldwide bestseller.

Plea: Starbucks Coffee CEO Howard Schultz, pictured above, has written an open letter to customers in the US asking them not to bring guns into their cafes . Starbucks will not enforce a US wide ban on guns in their stores, despite another mass shooting in America this week. The coffee chain has been forced to state its position on the gun debate which has been reignited after crazed gunman Aaron Alexis shot 12 people dead in a Washington Navy yard this week. Most US states allow people to carry . licensed guns and many companies, including the Seattle based cafe giant, do not have laws banning . firearms in their stores. Due to their lenient stance Starbucks has become a popular meeting place for the right-wing pro-firearms lobby. Some groups stage ""Starbucks Appreciation Days,"" in which gun lovers turn up at the cafes and order drinks while proudly carrying their weapons. Rifle clubs have filmed their meet ups before posting the videos on Youtube. In one clip, a gun enthusiast can be seen sipping from a Starbucks cup with a pistol on his hip. One website even sells products bearing . an altered version of the Starbucks logo, with the siren holding up a . gun in each hand with the words ""I Love Guns & Coffee."" The growing link between the coffee brand and gun owners has forced bosses to act. In an interview, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said anyone carrying a firearm would be 'unwelcome' in Starbucks but he confirmed the chain would stop short of banning the weapons completely. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO: . Deadly: guns like this glock pistol are allowed in Starbucks as long as the owner carries a license . Unwelcome: Starbucks have said that gun-toting customers make others feel uncomfortable . Schultz said the pro-gun meetings had . 'made our customers uncomfortable', adding: 'to be clear: we do not want . these events in our stores.' He is hoping armed customers will respect the companies wishes, but when asked how staff would deal with those carrying guns, he said: ""We will not ask you to leave"". Support: t-shirts like the one shown above are popular with pro-gun lobbyists who meet at Starbucks . In a memo circulated to staff, Starbucks workers have been told not to confront gun owners or ask them to leave simply for being armed. Starbucks has bought advertising space in major US newspapers this week to publish an open letter from Schultz. But although the letter states their opposition to guns, it also confirms that the company will be standing by its position that the decision to ban guns should be left to lawmakers . Critics of Starbucks have highlighted several American companies who do not allow firearms in their stores. Peet's Coffee & Tea and Whole Foods say they have had no trouble enforcing their gun bans. Shannon Watts, founder of the gun reform group Moms Demand Action, questioned why Starbucks has taken strong stances on other issues such as smoking. Earlier this year the company banned smoking within 25 feet of its cafes with the idea being to extend its no-smoking policy to the outdoor seating areas.","US coffee chain insist they will serve customers carrying licensed guns in their American stores .

From 6ft supermodel Grace Jones redefining the meaning of the word 'fierce' in shoulder-pads and stilettos to Adam Ant's embrace of the New Romantic, the 80s had no shortage of iconic fashion moments. But of all the striking images documenting the decade's ultra-stylish beau monde, few are as beautiful as those produced by fashion illustrator, Tony Viramontes. Although Viramontes, who first came to prominence in the late 1970s, didn't live to see the end of the decade, his wonderful illustrations have gained a cult following among fashion fans for whom Christian Lacroix is still the only designer worth wearing. Bold: Viramontes was famous for his modern approach to illustration, shown here in a sketch for YSL . Striking: Viramontes had a knack for capturing movement, especially noticeable in this Versace sketch (above) His work wasn't all Lacroix though. Other designers whose work was translated into his trademark sharp lines and vivid colours included Yves Saint Laurent, Versace, Chanel and Valentino, and he also created a portfolio of portraits with subjects ranging from Paloma Picasso to Duran Duran. 'Fashion, art and life were indistinguishable to Viramontes,' writes author Dean Rhys Morgan in his new book about the illustrator, Bold, Beautiful And Damned: The World Of 1980s Fashion Illustrator Tony Viramontes. 'His aesthetic went far beyond his drawings and he became a great commercial fashion illustrator. 'His work captured movement in fleeting moments – the way a woman might throw her coat over her shoulders, hold a cigarette or cross her legs – small gestures that can make clothes and the women wearing them all the more memorable.' Powerful: Among Viramontes fashion clients were Christian Dior (left) and couturier Leon Vissot (right) Elegant: A red hat by milliner Stephen Jones OBE . Groundbreaking: The world's first transgender model, Teri Toye . Striking: A boldly coloured portrait of Ron Grace . Bold, Beautiful and Damned: The World of 1980s Fashion Illustrator Tony Viramontes . In the Bold, Beautiful And Damned, page after page shows smoky-eyed women, swan-necked and crimson-lipped, an oddly haunting record of a decade that style was rumoured to have forgotten. Most spectacular of all, though, are the illustrations that deal with Paris couture - then enjoying a particularly opulent moment - and a passion of Viramontes. He embraced it gluttonously, says Rhys Morgan, who adds: . 'The flamboyance of the moment was a perfect fit for his vocation: fashion swung his way as the hard outlines, bold colours and overt glamour all lent themselves to his pen and paintbrush.' Tragically, Viramontes wasn't given much time to pursue his love of couture, dying in 1988 at the age of just 31. Despite Viramontes' untimely death, his wonderful illustrations remain and offer a glimpse of the glamorous side of a decade much maligned today. Bold, Beautiful and Damned: The World of 1980s Fashion Illustrator Tony Viramontes by Dean Rhys Morgan (£30, Laurence King Publishing, www.laurenceking.com) In this exclusive extract from Bold, Beautiful and Damned: The World of 1980s Fashion Illustrator Tony Viramontes, author Dean Rhys Morgan reveals how a meeting with couturier Valentino left Viramontes inspired... By 1984 the fashion world had well and . truly caught on, Viramontes attained a fashion nirvana when, after an . introduction by fashion editor Franca Sozzani, he was summoned to Rome . by the couturier Valentino Garavani to create a portfolio of drawings . that were to mark his silver jubilee celebrations in the pages of Vogue . Italia. Sozzani recalls that 'while people have always perceived . Valentino to be very classical, Giancarlo Giammetti [the couturier’s . business partner] was always looking for young and avant-garde people to . work with' to keep the brand current and relevant. 'Haute couture at . the time was perceived to be rather staid,' remembers Tony’s agent . Eugenia Melian. But he was able to give Garavani’s ruffles a new twist: 'Viramontes made Valentino very modern,' says Giammetti, 'and that was . very important. I thought that fashion illustrated by an artist would be . very eye-catching and new. It evokes a dream, we sell dreams and . romance [and] Tony knew how to do it with a few strokes.' The . intricacies of Valentino’s gowns inspired Viramontes to create some of . his most defiantly high-fashion images. 'The clothes were so complex to . draw, it was almost like an exercise,' remembers model Lisabeth Garber. 'Tony’s sketches were intuitive, right out of the hand.' 'He was quite . free,' concurs Giammetti, 'he worked very quickly and if something did . not work for me, he would redo it immediately.'","The illustrations are the work of artist Tony Viramontes .

I can’t believe I opened the door,’ she said. Later, she said the man was knocking on her door and ‘he's in my front yard yelling.’ The deadly encounter unfolded at about 2.30 a.m. on Saturday morning after 24-year-old Jonathan Ferrell, had apparently been in an automobile wreck. A crash so severe he would have had to climb out of the back window to escape.

When three officers arrived they claims that Ferrell ran towards them. One officer attempted to Taser Ferrell but that didn't work and investigators said Ferrell continued to run towards Officer Randall Kerrick who had his service weapon drawn. Officer Kerrick fired 12 shots at Ferrell, striking Ferrell ten times. CMPD said officers on the scene thought Ferrell was a threat, but Kerrick was the only one who drew his gun and fired.

The Charlotte NAACP called on Tuesday for an increased charge for Officer Kerrick because 'recent released information about the incident shows beyond a shadow of a doubt that this was more than manslaughter, this was a brutal killing and execution of Jonathan Ferrell.' 'There is no evidence that shows Jonathan Ferrell should have been shot at all,' Charlotte NAACP president Kojo Nantambu said. 'But for Officer Kerrick to shoot 12 times and striking Mr. Ferrell 10 times indicates more than a reflex, it smells more of hatred and rage which shows that Mr. Kerrick was predisposed in killing a Black Man and did so with extreme prejudice.' He says the NAACP will be lobbying for a murder charge, saying that 'no other charge will suffice.' Brotherly love: Jonathan Ferrell's brother Willie said. 'Jonathan was never the type of person to harm nobody' Ferrell's family said the former Florida A&M University football player moved to Charlotte about a year ago to be with his fiancee and was working two jobs. He wanted to go back to school and eventually become an automotive engineer.

They may not be binging on broccoli, but some University of New Hampshire students are at least pausing before they fill up on fried food, thanks to dishware designed to remind them about healthy options. Two years after the federal government abandoned the food pyramid as a symbol for healthful eating and adopted an image of a plate instead, the university has gone a step further by printing dietary guidelines directly on plates used in campus dining halls. The so-called Wildcat Plates, named after the school's mascot, offer a bit more detail than the 'My Plate' graphic promoted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. A new plate at the New Hampshire college spells out dietary guidelines willing students to choose healthy foods when mom and dad aren't around anymore to serve them . While the USDA image shows a plate . divided into four segments labeled 'fruits,' ''vegetables,' 'grains,' and 'proteins,' the Wild cat plate specifies 'lean protein' and 'whole . grains' and offers suggestions such as 'try whole wheat pasta, brown . rice or quinoa.' Like schools around the country, UNH has revamped its dining halls in recent years to add healthier - some would even say gourmet - offerings. First Lady Michelle Obama's 'Let's Move!' campaign has collaborated on past initiatives with the USDA's 'My Plate' program. The university has set a goal of becoming the nation's healthiest campus by 2020 and believes the new plates are a helpful tool for students who may be away from home and making their own food choices for the first time, said Jo Porter, deputy director of the New Hampshire Institute for Health Policy and Practice. 'They're moving from a place where sometimes their dining experiences at home were kind of dictated by their parents, and now they have a lot of freedom, which is great in some ways, but this becomes one of the helpful reminders for how to eat well,' she said. 'Some people will use them to get kind of a sense of what a healthy plate looks like, and then ingrain that in their everyday living and not need that plate every single time.' The plates, made of melamine, are mixed in with the university's standard ceramic plates, with about 1,300 circulating through three dining halls that serve 12,000 meals per day. During one recent lunch hour, some students piled their plates with veggies, while others reached for grilled cheese, pasta and sausage. Freshman Mike Carbone covered the fruit and vegetable portions of his plate with fried onion rings and the protein section with grilled chicken. There was a pile of chicken nuggets in the middle, and blobs of ketchup and mustard in the grain section. University of New Hampshire hopes its students will avoid onion rings and french fries in favor of fruits, veggies and maybe some tofu . 'It's not a very nutritious lunch, but I'm drinking water,' he said. Carbone, 19, said he does try to eat healthily but said he pays no attention to the plates. Sophomore Nicole Grote said while she doesn't match her food to the plates, they've made her more aware of portion sizes, and in general, she thinks the university is taking the right approach. 'I think it makes sense,' said Grote, who stays away from both sugar and dairy products. 'People should eat healthy.' Peter Heislein, a junior, said the plates have prompted him to choose an apple instead of french fries on occasion, but they have not been a major influence on his diet. And his main reason for preferring the plates had more to do with how they emerge from the dishwasher than the healthy message. 'I wish it was better than this, but I like them because they're not searing hot like the ceramic plates,' he said. 'It does make a little (health) conscious, but not a ton.' New Hampshire college prints colorful plates in hopes of teaching students how to eat properly and avoid food that will pack on the pounds . Dining hall manager David Hill said he has seen some students taking the plates seriously, while others ignore them. It's all part of the challenge of keeping up with students' changing tastes while also promoting health, he said. 'We're always trying to infuse more healthy options as a choice, but we don't impose it on people,' he said. 'That's really our strategy: to have a balance.' A number of versions of the plates are available commercially, and they're often used as teaching tools, said Dr. Robert Post, acting executive director at the USDA's Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion. He did not know of other schools that have been serving food on the plates like UNH but said many are using the image in banners and posters. And since the USDA launched its 'My Plate on Campus' initiative in the spring, he said, more than 800 students in all 50 states and nearly a dozen other countries have signed up to become ambassadors who encourage healthy eating at their schools. The Wildcat plates are manufactured by a New Hampshire company. With USDA permission, UNH has copyrighted its modified design and hopes to license it to other high schools and colleges that could add their own logos to the plates and use them in their dining halls.","Colorful 'Wildcat plate' tells students how much vegetables, lean protein .

Home Office minister Jeremy Browne said the open door policy for EU workers had benefited Britain . Workers from Romania and Bulgaria expected to flock to the UK next year are no different to Brits who own holiday homes in France or Spain, a Home Office minister has claimed. Lib Dem Jeremy Browne insisted he was relaxed about the numbers of migrant workers who could come to Britain when working limits on the two countries are lifted next year. And he hit out at the UK Independence Party for wanting to ‘pull the drawbridge’ to the outside world. Mr Browne, who is widely seen as a leading figure on the right of the Liberal Democrats, defended the open door policies which have seen hundreds of thousands of people from Eastern Europe move to the UK. He told the New Statesman magazine that he is in the ‘unfashionable minority’ the influx of Eastern European workers to the UK. He said: ‘I don’t think there was a mistake. It was transformational in terms of Britain’s relationship with countries like Poland. ‘It was in our foreign policy interest but, at a much more direct, micro level, there are lots of employers in my constituency and around the country who are full of praise for the contribution that Poles have made to their businesses and the economy more generally.’ The government has refused to publish forecast for the number of Romanians and Bulgarians who might move to Britain, after Labour failed to accurately predict how many Poles would come here for work. But Mr Browne said: ‘They’re only complying with the same rules as British people who live in Spain or have holiday houses in France, or who work in Germany.’ He conceded that immigration has put pressure on public services, but added: ‘I think if you look at the overall ledger . . . the positives outweigh the negatives.’ With UKIP ahead of the Lib Dems in most polls, the junior coalition partner risks being eclipsed by the anti-EU party led by Nigel Farage. But Mr Browne insisted: ‘Essentially, the big choice the country faces is not really embodied that well by the two biggest parties: it is represented by the Lib Dems and UKIP. That’s where it’s thrown into stark relief.’ The number of Romanian and Bulgarian workers in the UK has risen dramatically in the last decade . He said it is a choice between ‘pulling the drawbridge up, erecting barriers to the outside’, and ‘being a welcoming, liberal, outward-looking, internationalist country that embraces the opportunities of globalisation’. Even before the immigration rules change figures already show about 100 Romanians and Bulgarians a day are getting jobs in Britain. The number of people from the two EU countries has soared by more than a third over the past year, even though they are not yet  allowed to work freely in this country. The number here has reached a record high of 141,000, according to the Office for National Statistics – over-shadowing the total number of Australians and New Zealanders for the first time since records began. There are already fears of an  influx of Romanians and Bulgarians next year when current restrictions on their rights to work in Britain are lifted. At present, they can only work here if they are self-employed, or are one of a limited number of seasonal workers allowed to come for up to six months a year but must then go home. From January, they will have  free access to the labour market in Britain, like other European Union citizens. The influx is hardly surprising, given that Bulgaria’s minimum wage is 73p an hour and in Romania it is 79p, while in Britain it will rise to £6.31 for over-21s later this year.","Lib Dem Jeremy Browne insists he is relaxed about open door policy .

Seats to next years Super Bowl XLVIII at MetLife Stadium in New York City will cost double compared to last year. The NFL is about to approve a plan that will see Club-level seats to the New Jersey venue  cost $2,600 each. Last year, the most sought after tickets to the game went for $1,250. Price hike: Next years tickets to the Super Bowl will cost more that double what they did in New Orleans in 2013 . Market value: Tickets for 9,000 premium seats will cost about $2,600 each, more than double the $1,250 price of similar tickets at last season¿s Super Bowl in New Orleans . That's more than double the price of the most coveted tickets from last year's game, which went for $1,250. The price hike will affect roughly 9,000 tickets however, the aim is for 30% of tickets to cost less than $800. The second cheapest batch of seats are due to cost around $1,500 - up from $950 in the Big Easy. The league has explained the drastic price hikes by stating the rise simply brings the tickets more into line with their market value. NFL Logic: We are looking to close the gap between the face value of the ticket and its true value as reflected on the secondary market . All Super Bowl tickets usually sell for well above face value on the secondary market. 'We are looking to close the gap between the face value of the ticket and the true value of a ticket to what has become the premier sports and entertainment event,' NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said. It's not all about raising costs, however, the NFL has said it is dropping prices for the cheapest seats to $500 next year from $600 in 2013. Last years premium tickets that officially cost $1,250 sold for $6,000 and over according to the Wall Street Journal. Cheaper: Tickets for the next tier of seats are expected to cost $1,500 each, compared with $950 in New Orleans. About 40 percent of general admission seats will cost less than $1,000 . The Super Bowl is an odd occasion in some ways because even the most ardent fans don't usually get the chance to buy tickets directly for their face value. The two participating teams get 17.5% of available tickets (about 14,000 each), and the league gets to distribute the remaining 25% to sponsors and partners. All 32 teams get a set number of tickets that they distribute to season-ticket holders via a lottery. It means that most spectators at the game will have bought their tickets on the secondary market. The NFL is arguing that if people are prepared to pay extortionate prices on that secondary ticket, then the organization that hosts the Superbowl should be entitled to take a bigger share also. The organization says it has done its own research about how much the tickets are really worth. Many $600 tickets resold for close to $2,000 whilst premium club seats ended up selling around the $6,000 mark. And just like everything else in New York, officials are arguing that the 50 million people living near next years northeastern venue can afford to shell out a bit more.","Most tickets that are sold by the NFL are resold at double or triple face value .

The Rabbi behind the Los Angeles Kabbalah Center, who attracted followers including Madonna, Britney Spears and Demi Moore, died today, aged 86. Rabbi Philip Berg, known as Rav by his devotees, had been in declining health since a stroke in 2004. The 86-year-old Rabbi was best known for bring Jewish mysticism to the masses through the center he set up in 1965. Mentor: Rabbi Philip Berg introduced followers including Madonna and Britney to Kabbalah . At the height of its popularity, celebrities including Paris Hilton, Rosie O'Donnell and Lindsay Lohan could all be seen wearing the red thread bracelet associated with Kabbalah - an ancient practice usually reserved for Jewish scholars. Demi Moore and Ashtun Kutcher held their 2005 wedding at the Los Angeles center and Madonna has donated millions to the center and says Kabbalah inspired her 1998 album Ray of Light. Rav 'left us with incredible knowledge through . thousands of hours of teaching, examples of courage that we will never . forget, and the comfort of a Kabbalah Centre that we can all call home,' a statement from the center said today. The Los Angeles center, which was founded in 1965, has attracted criticism for the lucrative and celebrity-friendly way it presents ancient Jewish mysticism, according to the Los Angeles Times. But the center said Berg had 'created a path for millions to learn and live Kabbalah'. The New York rabbi gave up his career in business to learn from Rav Yehuda Brandwein, one of the greatest kabbalists of the last century. He followed him to Israel to learn more and, when he returned to the U.S, started looking for ways to make the religion more accessible. Devoted: Madonna leaves the Los Angeles Kabbalah Center . Star appeal: Ashton Kutcher, left, married Demi Moore at the center. Paris Hilton, right, with a thread bracelet . Belief: Britney Spears wears the red threat and carries the Holy Zohar while pregnant with her first child . Celebrity followers were easily recognized by the $26 red thread bracelet, said to ward off evil, that they would wear. Roseanne Barr credits its spiritual teachings with changing her life. '[Kabbalah] helped me to totally reconfigure my entire being, the way I thought, the way I did everything,' she told USA Today in 2004. In an interview with MTV's Kurt Loader, Madonna explained a friend had introduced her to the teachings of 'this charismatic Rabbi'. 'The thing about it is there's similarities to Buddhism ... you have to take responsibility for the chaos in your life,' she said. Madonna remained close to Rav and his family, helping to fund and set up a Kabbalah Center in London's Mayfair, and donating at least $18 million, according to the Times of Israel. And Madonna's ex-husband Guy Ritchie . is said to have defended it by saying: 'The difference between Kabbalah . and Catholicism is the amount of people ... You don't call Catholicism a . cult.' The organization, which also sells blessed water, has assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Following: Los Angeles' Kabbalah Center has attracted high profile devotees . Following: Lindsay Lohan with one of the red bracelets, and Mischa Barton, right, have been linked to Kabbalah . Mystical: Rabbi Berg was credited with bringing the ancient branch of Judaism to the masses . The first branch was opened in 1922, and Kabbalah now has centers in more than 40 cities around the world. The website for the Los Angeles branch describes the religion as 'the world's oldest body of spiritual wisdom' containing 'the long-hidden keys to the secrets of the universe as well as to the mysteries of the human heart and soul'. Rav's wife will and two sons will continue to run the center.

Treasure trove: The New York Public Library has made public a cache of never-published papers of psychologist and 1960s icon Timothy Leary, seen in this 1950s photo giving a lecture on his first book, ìInterpersonal Diagnosis of Personality . A vast collection of Timothy Leary files, much of it previously unpublished, is being made public for the first time today at the New York Public Library, which purchased the materials from the LSD guru’s estate in 2011. The archive ‘is the missing link in every attempt to piece together an account of research into Timothy Leary and the emergence of scientific research into psychedelic drugs and popular drug counterculture,’ said Denis Berry, a trustee for the Leary estate. Leary, who coined the phrase ‘turn on, tune in, drop out,’ was one of the most polarizing figures of the counterculture. He advocated the therapeutic use of psychedelic drugs including LSD and psychedelic mushrooms. His illustrious contemporaries Allen Ginsberg, Abbie Hoffman, Jack Kerouac, Aldous Huxley and other noted figures frequently visited Millbrook Estate in upstate New York where Leary continued to conduct his psychedelic experiments after being fired as a psychology lecturer at Harvard University. Dubbed by President Richard Nixon 'the most dangerous man in America,' Leary spent several years in prison before pulling off a daring escape and going into exile in the 1970s. He died in 1996 at age 75 from inoperable prostate cancer, uttering the last words 'why not?'. Leary's ashes were later shot into space on the Pegasus Rocket. The New York Public Library acquired the trove of Leary's writings for an undisclosed sum in 2011 and announced that it would not be made public for 18 to 24 months. A look back: In this circa 1961 file photo provided by the New York Public Library, a curled-up Timothy Leary reads a book . Archive highlights: The collection includes Leary's April 20, 1975, letter to friend Ken Kesey, written from inside California State Prison (left), and his handwritten outline of the Castalia Foundation - a spiritual retreat and center for experimentation with psychedelic drugs . The more than 300 boxes of files, filled with never-before-seen correspondence and manuscripts from leading scientific, artistic, literary and cultural figures of the day, ‘will force a reworking of the current narratives on Leary, his role in LSD research’ and the counterculture, Berry said. The archive contains drug session reports, completed questionnaires and letters relating to the various organizations Leary formed to continue his drug research after Harvard, including the International Federation for Internal Freedom, Castalia Foundation and the League for Spiritual Discovery. Among the highlights is a neatly typed description from 1966 of the psychedelic training courses Leary conducted at Millbrook and a 1975 letter he wrote from prison to ‘One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest’ author Ken Kesey. In the letter to Kesey, Leary says, ‘I think the time has come for me to go public about what I've been doing and learning.’ Futuristic: This undated photo shows Leary's Nintendo power glove and sneakers . These and the many unpublished manuscripts and letters from prison provide a rich source for research, said William Stingone, the library's curator of manuscript and archives. John McWhinnie, a rare-book dealer who appraised the archive for the Leary estate, said in his report that the archive ‘details a program into psychedelic research that was akin to (Alfred) Kinsey's research into human sexuality.’ The cache of documents embraces the lives and thoughts of all the players associated with the scientific and popular movement of LSD and drug counterculture, said McWhinnie, who died last year. McWhinnie was an associate of bookseller Glenn Horowitz, who eventually brokered the sale of the archive to the Public Library. Public enemy: Leary spent several years in prison on drug charges and was dubbed by President Richard Nixon 'the most dangerous man in America' High priest of LSD: Leary talks to followers and guests on the porch of the Millbrook, New York, mansion that houses his Castalia Foundation in September 1966 (left); Leary meditating at the Village Gate Theatre (right) Counterculture icon: Leary, left, pictured in 1995 with rock musician Todd Rundgren and pop musician/producer Don Was . Among the collection's many photographs is one of Leary standing at a chalkboard in the 1950s giving a lecture on his first book, ‘Interpersonal Diagnosis of Personality.’ The book marked his reputation in the field of clinical psychology before he went to Harvard to begin his research with psychedelic drugs. Among other things, it contains some 1,000 floppy discs that deal with Leary's intense interest in cyberculture and the development of computer software for his self-help games. For now, the library has no plans to make the archive available online. End of an era: Leary died in 1996 at age 75 from inoperable prostate cancer.

Workers at a Maine seafood plant have been accused of killing lobsters and crabs in a 'primitive and painful' manner, according to an animal rights group that filmed procedures at the plant. Footage allegedly taken at Linda Bean's Maine Lobster in Rockland showed workers pulling the bodies of lobsters apart while they were still alive and conscious, and rubbing away the organs of alive crabs. Animal rights group Peta filmed during a five-month investigation into slaughter methods at the seafood processing plant. Scroll down for video . Decapitated: A lobster waves its legs after having its head pulled off at the plant . Dismembered: A plant worker pulls the lobster's head off its body while it is still alive . 'Cruel': Peta claims the method, which doesn't kill the lobsters for several hours, is inhumane . 'These animals are dying agonizing deaths at this facility,' Dan Paden, evidence analysis manager at Peta, told CBS. The group said Linda Bean's should be using humane technology to stun or kill the crustaceans immediately, instead of subjecting them to cruel and prolonged deaths. Allegations: Linda Bean's lobster plant is accused of using cruel methods . Footage of the lobster processing showed the animals' bodies being pulled apart, with workers acknowledging that they remained alive for a couple of hours afterwards. A factory worker was also filmed jumping on a container filled with live lobsters. With the crabs, after their shells were removed they were held, still alive, against bristles that rub away their exposed organs. One of the workers said the crabs stay alive until they are dropped into boiling water later on in the process. Peta said it edited out features that could identify the plant because it was trying to work with the owners to find a more humane way to kill the crustaceans. Mr Paden told the Portland Press Herald the animal rights group was confident that the footage was authentic and accurate. An attorney for Linda Bean's said however, he could not comment because it was not clear where the footage was taken. Peta plans to file a criminal complaint against the plant today with police and the district attorney. Maine law bans intentionally killing animals with a method that doesn't kill them outright. Lobsters and crabs are not exempt from the law. Shocking: Peta says it filmed a plant worker jumping up and down on a container filled with lobsters . Peta plans to file a criminal complaint against the plant today with police and the district attorney. In some states lobsters and crabs are not covered by the laws because of widely held beliefs that their simple nervous systems make them immune to pain. Alive: Live crabs are held against a rotating brush which removes their organs . End of the line: The crabs are still alive when they are dropped into a vat of boiling water . However, recent research by Queen's University Belfast showed that crabs would avoid using a shelter where they had previously received an electric shock. Robert Elwood, who carried out the research, said the crab behavior in the Peta footage was 'consistent with that of animal feeling pain'. Dr Bjorn Roth, from the . Norwegian Institute of Food, Fishery and Aquaculture, also viewed the . video of the Maine plant's killing method. 'This is carving the animal alive and would no doubt cause unnecessary pain,' he said. Peta said the plant should use a device called Crustastun, which stuns the animals' nervous system and kills them almost instantaneously. Debate: Scientists disagree as to whether lobsters can feel pain but recent research appears to prove they do . 'There's no excuse for the blatant and, . we would argue illegal, cruelty going on at this slaughterhouse when . there are alternate slaughter methods that rapidly stun and kill these . animals,' Mr Paden said. The Linda Bean plant is a big company in Maine's $300 million lobster business. In a report earlier this year, the plant's five stations were expected to buy 7 million lb of seafood this year. Linda Bean's Maine Lobster has not yet responded to a request for a comment from Mail Online.","Peta claims seafood factory breaks slaughter laws .

The jury of six men and six women will reconvene Sept. 4 to determine if Naso gets the death penalty. All . the victims were found dumped in rural Northern California locations. Roggasch's body was found in Marin County and was the reason Naso's . trial was held in the historical Marin Civic Center designed by noted . architect Frank Lloyd Wright. Colon was found in Contra Costa County and . the other two victims in Yuba County. Naso . was arrested in 2010 after probation officers visiting his Reno, Nev., . home in connection with an unrelated gun conviction discovered numerous . photographs of nude women posed in unnatural positions who appeared dead . or unconscious with mannequin parts and lingerie strewn about nearby. According to KNTV, he told the cops it was his art. Scroll down for video...

Graphic . entries from Naso's journal that detailed how the killer stalked and . raped his victims were read in court during the closing arguments. Naso wrote descriptions of rapes and sexual assaults in . the journal as far back as the 1950s, Marin County prosecutor Rosemary . Slote said as she read from the journal's pages. Naso drugged and photographed his unconscious victims then strangled them and disposed of their naked bodies. In entry after . entry, Naso wrote how he would stalk and approach a . woman, offer her a ride home and then 'put it to her', often in his car. One read: 'Girl in north Buffalo woods. She was real pretty. Had to knock her out first.' Investigators . said they also found a ‘List of 10’ that Naso had scrawled with . descriptions of 10 women, including references prosecutors believe . described the four victims he was charged with killing.

The six additional . women on the list have not been identified, but authorities continue to . investigate any possible connections to Naso. Same name: A 10-year-old was raped and murdered in Rochester, New York in 1971. Carmen Colon shared a name with one of Naso's California victims but was far younger than his usual prey . Joseph Naso was convicted Tuesday of killing four prostitutes--all with first and last names beginning with the same letters--in Northern California between the 1970s and 1990s. Investigators found ghoulish personal accounts of what he'd done in a series of journals and lists at his Reno, Nevada home. Though tried and convicted for only the four crimes, investigators continue to believe Naso could be connected to at least six more murders. After the Rochester native's arrest in 2010, police briefly fingered him in connection with three other brutal murder cold cases from the New York State area where he was born, lived for a time, and would still continue to visit. And all three murdered girls had something in common: their first names and last names began with the same letters. Michelle . Maenza, Wanda Walcowicz, and Carmen Colon--who even had the same name . as one of the California women Naso is convicted of killing. These were the original Doube-Initial murders and they rocked the city of Rochester, New York in the mid 1970s. Write caption here . Evidence . at Naso's home suggests the killer's victims weren't just in . California. One entry in his frightening 'List of 10' reads 'Girl in . north Buffalo woods. She was real pretty. Had to knock her out first.' But while some clues implicated Naso, others seemed to clear him of the crimes. Though the Rochester girls indeed had 'double initials,' they were also quite young. Each was between the ages of 10 and 12. Naso's California victims were all adult prostitutes. Naso . was finally cleared of killing Maenza, Walcowicz, and the Rochester . Colon after DNA found on one of the victims did not match his own. Now, . the search continues both for Naso's other possible victims and the . murderer or murderers of the Rochester double-initial killer. Naso . acted as his own attorney and told jurors during his closing arguments . that he often hired prostitutes to photograph in exotic poses and . enjoyed off-beat art. But as he smiled, always wearing a suit and tie, he insisted he was no killer. Nonetheless, . the balding Naso, who often seemed befuddled and repeated himself . during his rambling closing arguments, struggled to explain away some of . the most persuasive evidence against him. Naso's . DNA was found on the pantyhose Roggasch was wearing when her body was . found. His ex-wife's DNA was found on pantyhose wrapped around . Roggasch's neck. Naso told . the jury that the evidence only showed he had had sex with Roggasch. He . said there was no proof that he killed her and that prosecutors had no . way of knowing who put the pantyhose around her neck. Execution? Naso, here in another June 17 file photo, will again represent himself for the penalty phase of the trial as he tried to avoid the death penalty . Unlikely: Even if Naso bumbles even more as he argues against the death penalty, he's unlikely to be executed. California's death row list is likely long enough that the 79-year-old will first die . Graphic diary entries that detail how Naso stalked and raped his victims were read out in court during the closing arguments of his trial. Naso, 79, wrote descriptions of rapes and sexual assaults in the journal as far back as the 1950s, Marin County prosecutor Rosemary Slote said as she read from the journal's pages. The lawyer said they contain accounts of Naso approaching women and offering them a ride home. After a girl got into his car, Naso writes that he would 'put it on her.' Prosecutors found a 'list of 10' girls they say was a roster of the serial killer's victims. The victims coincided with locations, including Cleveland, Kansas City, Buffalo, Rochester, Wichita, Berkeley, and even London. 'Outside the front door I overpowered her and ravaged her,' read one entry set in London, the Marin Independent Journal reported. 'I couldn't help myself.' Another read: 'Girl in north Buffalo woods. She was real pretty. Had to knock her out first.' Legal . analysts said that Naso made a mistake representing himself, even if he . boasted at one point that ‘I think I'm doing quite well’ during his . closing arguments, which consumed all day Friday and half of Monday. ‘He's bright,’ said attorney Brian Kanel, who watched some of the trial. ‘But not that bright.’ Another legal observer agreed. Steven . Clark, a former prosecutor now in private practice, said a good defense . attorney would have hired a DNA expert to at least try to throw some . doubt on how the evidence was gathered, stored and processed to . undermine the prosecution's strongest argument. ‘The . prosecution did have a challenging case because it happened so long . ago,’ Clark said. ‘Why Mr. Naso chose to focus on the things he focused . on is beyond me. I'm not sure what his plan was.’ Even . if Naso is sentenced to death, it is unlikely he will be executed. There are 725 inmates already on California's Death Row and executions . have been on hold since 2006, when a federal judge ordered an overhaul . of California's execution protocol. It will take at least another year . for prison officials to properly adopt the state's new single-drug . execution method and have it cleared by the judge. Sheepish: Joseph Naso, 79, smiled often while he represented himself at trial for killing four prostitutes in the 1970s through the 1990s . In court: Naso is pictured with his public defender in April but eventually represented himself. A jury has yet to decide if the 79-year-old will face the death penalty . During his trial, he showed the jury . dozens of photographs he took of weddings, landscapes and family members . along with what he called 'glamour' or 'cheesecake' photographs of nude . women. He said he never forced any of them to do anything. Prosecutors, however, claimed he kept a list of his victims and mementos of his crimes. Closing . arguments were delayed briefly as the court investigated a truck . bearing the words 'Joseph Naso killed my sister' that was parked in the . jury lot.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 00:59 EST, 18 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:35 EST, 18 September 2013 . A federal judge has ordered a new trial for five former New Orleans police officers convicted of civil rights violations stemming from deadly shootings on a bridge after Hurricane Katrina. In a 129-page ruling released on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Kurt Engelhardt concluding the case had been tainted by 'grotesque prosecutorial misconduct.' He said at least three government attorneys had posted anonymous comments on a New Orleans newspaper's website, creating a 'carnival atmosphere' that perverted justice in the case. Second chance? Robert Faulcon Jr. (left) was convicted on charges in both fatal shootings, he was sentenced to 65 years last April, while Robert Gisevius Jr. (right) got 40 years . 'The public must have absolute trust and confidence in this process,' he wrote. 'Re-trying this case is a very small price to pay in order to protect the validity of the verdict in this case, the institutional integrity of this court, and the criminal justice system as a whole.' Less than a week after Katrina's 2005 landfall, police shot and killed two unarmed people and wounded four others on the Danziger Bridge. Five former officers cooperated with a Justice Department investigation and pleaded guilty to engaging in a cover-up to make the shootings appear justified. Also charged: Kenneth Bowen, left, got a 40-year-sentence, while Anthony Villavaso II, right, got 38 years . Retired Sgt. Arthur 'Archie' Kaufman wasn't charged in the shootings but was convicted of orchestrating the cover-up . After a jury convicted five other former officers in 2011, their attorneys argued that prosecutors' online comments and leaks to news organizations were part of a 'secret public relations campaign' that deprived their clients of a fair trial. Engelhardt granted their request for a new trial, though he called it a 'bitter pill to swallow.' 'The government's actions, and initial lack of candor and credibility thereafter, is like scar tissue that will long evidence infidelity to the principles of ethics, professionalism, and basic fairness and common sense necessary to every criminal prosecution, wherever it should occur in this country,' he wrote. Former police Sgts. Kenneth Bowen and Robert Gisevius and former officers Anthony Villavaso and Robert Faulcon had been convicted of charges related to the shooting and cover-up. Retired Sgt. Arthur 'Archie' Kaufman, who was assigned by the Police Department to investigate the case, wasn't charged in the shootings but was convicted of orchestrating the cover-up. Engelhardt sentenced them to prison terms that ranged from six to 65 years. All five are currently serving those sentences. Scene: The fatal incident occurred on the morning of September 4, 2005 when a group of residents was crossing the Danziger Bridge in the city's Gentilly area in search of food and supplies as police arrived . Villavaso's attorney, Tim Meche, said he hopes the Justice Department re-evaluates whether the case should be retried. 'The judge's opinion validates our belief that this case was a perversion of justice,' Meche said. Justice Department spokeswoman Dena Iverson said prosecutors were disappointed. 'We are reviewing the decision and considering our options,' she said in a statement. Prosecutors said Faulcon fatally shot 40-year-old Ronald Madison, a mentally disabled man, in the back on the west side of the bridge as he and his brother ran from gunfire on the bridge's east side, where 17-year-old James Brissette had been shot and killed by police. Romell Madison, one of Ronald's brothers, said the family is 'extremely disappointed' and urged the Justice Department to appeal the ruling. Romell Madison, center, one of Ronald's brothers, said the family is 'extremely disappointed' and urged the Justice Department to appeal the ruling . 'This decision re-opens this terrible wound not only for our family but our entire community,' he said in a statement. 'From the beginning of this ordeal our family has sought justice, not just for ourselves, but for all the victims and families.' Former U.S. Attorney Jim Letten resigned in December 2012 after two of his top deputies - Sal Perricone and Jan Mann - acknowledged they had posted anonymous comments on nola.com, The Times-Picayune's companion website, about cases their office had handled, including the bridge investigation. Mann, who was Letten's top deputy, told Justice Department investigators she told Letten about her posts shortly after Perricone's activities were exposed in March 2012. Mann said Letten 'didn't have a big reaction' to her confession, according to the judge's ruling. At a hearing in June 2012, Engelhardt said it appeared federal prosecutors didn't conduct a 'full-blown investigation' after The Associated Press and The Times-Picayune published articles about former officer Michael Lohman's guilty plea while his case was under seal. Lohman pleaded guilty to participating in a cover-up of the shootings. Former U.S. Attorney Jim Letten, center, resigned in December 2012 after two of his top deputies - Sal Perricone and Jan Mann - acknowledged they had posted anonymous comments on nola.com . The Justice Department appointed John Horn, a veteran federal prosecutor from Georgia, to conduct a new probe of the allegations. Horn's investigation revealed Karla Dobinski, a Washington-based attorney in the Justice Department's civil rights division, posted anonymous comments on nola.com during the last week of the trial. Dobinski wasn't part of the government's trial team but testified at an April 2011 pretrial hearing. Engelhardt said he was shocked by the revelation and cited it as a key factor in deciding to order a new trial. Horn also had asked that the two news organizations to disclose their sources of information about Lohman's anticipated guilty plea, but both have refused. In a footnote to his ruling, Engelhardt said the news organizations 'perpetuate the viability' of the officers' bid for a new trial 'and support its merit by implication' by refusing to identify their sources. The AP's outside counsel in the case said the news organization stands by its position. People make their way over the Danziger Bridge and into the Lower 9th Ward section of New Orleans during a Hurricane Katrina remembrance march in August 2007, two years after the storm swept through the city . 'Judge Engelhardt may be frustrated by the Justice Department's respect for the reporters' privilege in this case, but that privilege exists to promote the flow of important information to the public. 'A refusal to recognize the privilege would surely cause significant sources of information to dry up, to the great detriment of all of us,' said David Schulz of the firm Levine Sullivan Koch & Schulz. 'The AP's consistent position seeks to ensure the public has the information it needs for our democracy to function,' Schulz said. Engelhardt instructed attorneys in the case to confer within 30 days to 'determine scheduling needs' before asking him to schedule a status conference. Late Tuesday, the U.S. Senate confirmed New Orleans attorney Kenneth Polite as U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Louisiana. The office had been run by veteran federal prosecutor Dana Boente since Letten's resignation.","Five former officers pleaded guilty to engaging in a .

Earlier this year, the embattled head of the NHS Sir David Nicholson, pictured, implied there had been only one such payment . Health service bosses have spent £4million in just three years secretly gagging whistleblowers concerned about patient care. A total of 133 doctors, nurses and other staff have been quietly paid off in return for not speaking out. Yet earlier this year, the embattled head of the NHS Sir David Nicholson implied there had been only one such payment. It followed revelations that Gary Walker, former boss of United Lincolnshire Hospitals, was given £500,000 to leave quietly after repeatedly warning that targets were being put ahead of patients. He was made to sign a back-door deal known as a judicial mediation arrangement. This meant the money he was given was never declared to the Treasury, which controls the NHS’s purse strings. When Sir David was quizzed about the gagging order by MPs a few weeks later, he said: ‘It was the only one that I had ever come across.’ In March at a hearing of the Commons Health Select Committee, he added: ‘It is the first time in my experience I have ever seen that done.’ But figures obtained by Tory MP Steve Barclay sharply contradict his assertion. They show 41 such payments were made last year alone. Unlike normal gagging orders, these ‘secret’ orders do not have to be signed off by the Treasury. This meant the figures did not emerge  in previous revelations and the  public had no way of knowing that they exist. However, Mr Barclay was able to obtain the data via a Parliamentary question to the Department  of Health. Sir David is leaving his £211,000- a-year post as NHS chief executive next March having faced widespread criticism he failed to act over  the Mid Staffordshire scandal,  where hundreds of patients died from neglect. He also stands accused of presiding over a culture of secrecy in which managers are encouraged to gag staff daring to speak out. After becoming known as the ‘Man with No Shame’, he faced demands from MPs and medical professionals to leave immediately and forgo his £2million taxpayer-funded pension pot. Mr Barclay said: ‘It appears David Nicholson either didn’t know about this failure within the NHS which led to it wasting millions of pounds even though he is the accountable officer for this money. ‘The other explanation is that he did know. If this is the case, he’ll need to write a letter to  Parliament explaining why he didn’t tell the truth. A total of 266 doctors, nurses and other staff have been quietly paid off in return for not speaking out (posed by models) ‘It’s a patient safety issue first and foremost. You now have 133 fewer senior people flagging concerns that may have led to discussions and possibly more money to resolve the issues.’ The figures show that 77 NHS trusts, including hospitals and GP bodies, spent £3.9million on judicial mediation deals for 133 staff from 2009/10 to 2012/13. But the Department of Health refused to disclose the size of the payments and would not name the trusts involved. Judicial mediations are usually arranged when an employee has gone to a tribunal, for example claiming unfair dismissal. These figures do not include the more common gagging orders for staff who agree to leave quietly without taking legal action. Separate data shows that the health service spent £15million paying off 600 staff since 2009 in payments approved by the Treasury. Senior consultants paid up to £72 an hour for working evenings and weekends . Dr Kim Holt, who raised concerns about the clinic which sent Baby P home, said: ‘From the top there is pressure to cut costs and meet targets. ‘The bullying comes from the top down.’ Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has told NHS trusts not to use gagging clauses but critics said bosses will find ways round this.","It followed revelations that Gary Walker, former boss of United Lincolnshire Hospitals, was given £500,000 to leave quietly .

Elisabeth Carroll was discovered in the living room after her husband told his boss: 'I think I've killed Liz' A printer who was racked with money worries strangled his wife of 23-year-years and then told his boss: 'I won't be in today - I think I’ve killed Liz'. Cash-strapped Michael Carroll, 60, attacked his wife Elizabeth, 64, at their home, a jury was told. The laminator had defaulted on mortgage payments and had been ordered to pay the remaining £75,000 of his interest-only mortgage within five years. When his wife was made redundant the financial stress became too much for him and he snapped, Cambridge Crown Court heard. Mr Carroll attacked his wife of 23 years in their living room - while he was wearing his pyjamas and she was still in her dressing gown and nightie. Injuries to her shoulder detected during a postmortem showed she had tried to fight back during the struggle. When Mr Carroll - who was 'always punctual' - failed to show up at work the next morning his boss Vernon MacFarlane called him. But the laminator explained he wouldn’t be able to make it in, adding: 'I think I’ve killed Liz.' The day before Elisabeth’s death, Mr Carroll left work at 4.45pm as usual, but when he didn’t turn up for work the next morning Mr MacFarlane grew concerned about him. Mr MacFarlane rung him at around 10am. He told the court: 'I rang him and asked if he was well and he said no. 'I said ""you'd better get yourself over to see a doctor"", and he said ""It's a bit late for that"". 'I said ""Why, what's wrong?"" And he said ""I think I've killed Liz"". Mr Carroll, who denies murder, attacked his wife of 23 years in their living room, a court heard . 'At this stage I didn’t really believe she was dead and I said ""have you called an ambulance or the police?"" He said no. 'I asked him if I should do it and he said yes. 'I put the phone down and was a bit shocked, so I told my brother the story and asked him to ring the ambulance for me.' Peter Gair, prosecuting, said police were called and Mr Carroll answered the door of his ground floor flat in his pyjamas, telling police officers his wife’s body was in the living room. Mr Gair said it was clear she had been held down during a struggle. Mr MacFarlane told the court he had employed Mr Carroll at Mac Print Finishing in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, for 12 years. Police were called and Mr Carroll answered the door of his ground floor flat in his pyjamas . The senior partner explained he had noticed the employee's stress levels rising in the two weeks before Mrs Carroll’s death and had tried to help him. He said: 'After knowing someone for nine years one would think you’d know someone well. 'It was very difficult to converse with him. When I asked him what was wrong he said he had to pay his mortgage and he didn’t think he could. 'He had to pay £75,000 in five years and that was what was worrying him. 'He just kept saying £75,000 over and over.' 'After tax the couple had a combined income of £1,100 a month. Their combined net disposable income was £360 a month' Mr MacFarlane also told the court: 'I made an appointment for him to go and see Citizens’ Advice, but he did not go.' Mr Carroll and his wife were living off just £83 a week as they attempted to stay on top of their mortgage payments. He had taken out an interest only mortgage in 1989 and was approaching full term for the loan when he would have to pay a lump sum of £75,000 for his home. A financial advisor told the court the Carrolls had failed to take out an endowment policy and did not have enough in pensions to cover the cost. Mortgage consultant Ian Cooper told the jury he had been discussing loan options with the couple, who did not want to sell their home. Mr Carroll earned £13,624 a year while Elisabeth Carroll received just £2,340 a year 'probably from her pension' after she had been made redundant in the 1990s, the court heard. Mr Cooper explained after tax the couple had a combined income of £1,100 a month. They paid an estimated £460 a month towards their mortgage interest, which left them with a net disposable income to live on of just £360 a month. From that the couple had to eat and also hoped to service a loan of £74,500 so they could keep their home. It meant Mr Carroll's plans to retire at 65, set out in a will signed in October 2011, appeared unlikely. Mr Cooper said: 'The plan that they applied for was affordable.' As Mr Carroll's financial situation worsened, friends said he became so quiet and introverted someone had to drive him home after work one day. The court was told Mrs Carroll had overcome bowel cancer but was relatively healthy before her death. Carroll, from Fletton, Peterborough, is accused of with killing his wife Elisabeth at their home at around 7am, on 24 May 2012. He has denied the murder but admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. The trial continues .

Accused: Marilyn Edge, 42, allegedly killed her two children after losing custody of them . A woman charged with killing her 13-year-old autistic son and 9-year-old daughter in the midst of a custody dispute has asked a judge for the death penalty during her first court appearance since her arrest. Marilyn Edge, 42, looked dishevelled during her video appearance on Tuesday as she was arraigned on two counts of murder with special circumstances. When Orange County Superior Court Judge Craig Robison asked if she wanted her arraignment postponed to October 25, Edge twice said, 'Only if you promise me the death penalty.' Edge could be eligible for the death penalty if convicted. The judge postponed her arraignment. A phone call seeking comment from Edge's attorney, Deputy Public Defender Arlene Speiser, was not immediately returned. One special circumstance allegation filed by prosecutors claims the children were poisoned. Deputy District Attorney Sonia Balleste would only say there was evidence of poisoning found in the hotel room where the bodies of Edge's daughter Faith and son Jaelen were discovered. An autopsy has been performed, but toxicology tests are pending. Asked about her reaction to Edge's request for the death penalty, Balleste said: 'The only death penalty I've seen her be efficient at was the death of her children. All the rest is just talk.'

"By . Kieran Corcoran . PUBLISHED: . 16:29 EST, 17 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:32 EST, 18 September 2013 . The Crown Prosecution Service spent more than £1million on ‘golden goodbye’ pay-offs for departing employees, it emerged today. The pay packages, which total between £515,000 and £620,000, were made in the past four years by the service, which takes legal action against suspected criminals on behalf of the Government. The bumper payments, made to former chief operating officer Mike Kennedy, 59, and an unidentified other employee, were uncovered by Exaro, the investigative website. Mike Kennedy, pictured here when he was president of EU quango Eurojust, was given a payout of more than £515,000 when he left the CPS . The second employee, who was made redundant in 2009, was given an even larger severance package, totalling £623,555. This means that the CPS spent has spent more than £1.1million on deals for only these two members of staff. The package for Mr Kennedy, who was made redundant last November from his £145,000-a-year-position, is made up of several different payments worth between £45,000 and £170,000 each. CPS accounts for the last financial year show that Mr Kennedy was given between £45,000 and £60,000 to compensate him for not having a notice period, a lump sum of between £160,000 and £170,000 when he started drawing his civil service pension, and an unexplained ‘compensation’ payment of between £255,000 and £260,000. He would also have become eligible for the first year of regular payments from his pension, which amount to between £55,000 and £60,000 per year. This means the total value of his payment for leaving the job was between £515,000 and £550,000. General 'compensation'  £255,000  -  £260,000 . Notice period payment      £45,000  -    £60,000 . Pension lump sum          £160,000  -  £170,000 . First year of pension        £55,000  -    £60,000 . Total                               £515,000  -  £550,000 . One insider told Exaro that Kennedy left his post last November because the CPS struggled to find a role for him after he returned from a secondment to a European Union body. Before being made redundant Mr Kennedy had been on a five-year secondment as president of the EU quango Eurojust, which helps different judicial systems work together. After his return in 2007, an insider alleges that CPS bosses did not know what to do with Kennedy, but that they were contractually bound to give him his job back. The anonymous source told Exaro: 'You have this guy who has been out for five years, but what do you do with him? Mike Kennedy was the chief operating office of the CPS, but left for five years to be president of an EU quango . 'At the end of his secondment, he was guaranteed the right of return to his home organisation. It is normal when you are seconded that your home organisation must take you back.' However, a spokesman denied that Mr Kennedy had left the CPS for lack of a job to do. He said: 'We know Mike Kennedy’s employment history. He was appointed as COO well before his secondment at Eurojust was due to end. 'Mike returned to act in this important role and stayed in it for five years. The situation that the source describes – Mike Kennedy returning from Eurojust and not having a job to do, somehow prompting his retirement five years later – has no factual basis.' In addition to Mr Kennedy’s package, the CPS paid off a second ‘senior employee’, who has not been identified. He or she received a payment of £623,555 – tens of thousands more than Mr Kennedy’s – in 2009. A spokesman for the CPS said that payments to Mr Kennedy were made: 'entirely in accordance with all appropriate Cabinet Office guidance and Civil Service pension rules.' The spokesman also said that in the case of the secpond payment that the CPS: ‘Applied the contractual compulsory redundancy terms to which the employee was entitled, and had no discretion in the size of this payment.’ Pay-offs for high-ranking public officials have been under especial scrutiny recently, after MPs attacked executives at the BBC over the scale of ‘golden goodbye’ payments. The corporation gave senior managers received a total of £25milion in severance deals between 2009 and 2012. It tried to keep their identities secret, but has been ordered by Parliament to name the individuals.","Former chief operating office Mike Kennedy received at least £515,000 .

A lawyer's clerk is facing prison after she texted a convicted robber whom her firm was representing in his cell before a mobile phone was used to stage his breakout from a prison van. Sarah McCabe, 33, sent three texts to Ryan MacDonald after the phone was illegally smuggled into a prison where he was being held. Three weeks later MacDonald, 20, and a fellow inmate were broken out of a prison van at gunpoint whilst they were on their way to face court. McCabe, seen here arriving at Preston Magistrates' Court, texted Ryan MacDonald, who escaped from a prison van during a daring breakout out in Salford, Greater Manchester. She admitted assisting an offender . A gang of masked men, believed to be using GPS technology to track the van, blocked it with a Saab car in the middle of the street and threatened a guard with a sawn-off shotgun before smashing the windows of the vehicle. The two inmates escaped from the truck and all five jumped back into the Saab car which was dumped further down the street. Three of the gang ran into a nearby . council estate whilst the other two sped off on a motorbike. Both . escaped inmates were recaptured a few days later. It is not clear how the phone was used in the break out, although many smartphones have a feature that allows them to broadcast their GPS location to others.

McCabe of Swinton, Salford, who was acting for MacDonald in his court case was arrested after a SIM card was recovered from his cell at the privately run Altcourse jail near Liverpool in the run up to the escape. Police investigating the breakout . later examined the SIM and found three text messages from MacCabe on it . in which she and her client discussed the possible sentence he might . face for robbing pawnbrokers shops. In . one message MacDonald texted McCabe saying: 'Bail me?' but she did not . reply. He then texted her saying: 'Get us a three.

McDonald texted back saying: 'Is it a five then?' and McCabe who works at David O’Reilly Solicitors in Salford sent two further texts. At Preston magistrates she burst into tears after she was warned she faced over six months in jail after she admitted assisting an offender. District judge Jane Goodwin sent her to crown court saying the case was so serious her powers of sentencing were not sufficient enough. She told McCabe: 'You turned a blind eye to the fact that one of your clients had a mobile phone in prison. As a result you facilitated him accessing that mobile phone. You should have alerted someone. 'Not only does that cause security problems for the prison but it brings the legal profession into disrepute. The fact he escaped shows the impact that this had. You also failed to tell him to desist from contacting you.' A gang of masked men believed to be using GPS technology to track the police van blocked it with a Saab car . The prison van guard was threatened with a sawn off shotgun before the gang smashed the windows of the vehicle . Prosecutor Elisa Hopley said: 'A significant amount of planning into that escape was conducted by mobile phones held illegally. A phone used by MacDonald was active between March 8 and April 24. 'The SIM card was recovered from his cell but the handset was not recovered. The handset was the one used in the escape and that has not been found. 'McCabe’s personal telephone number came to the attention of the police. It became clear that she had contact with MacDonald when he was in prison. Her mobile phone was then seized. 'McCabe has admitted the offence and contact with MacDonald in interviews and admitted it was her personal phone and she used it for personal and work reasons. 'She was under no illusions that she was in contact with a phone that was held illegally. They talked about a potential sentence for MacDonald. Police investigating the breakout later examined the SIM and found three text messages from McCabe on it . MacDonald and another inmate escaped from the truck and all five jumped back into the Saab car which was dumped further down the street . 'McCabe did nothing to alert authorities and kept up the contact rather than bringing phone to the attention of authorities. 'Had the prison authorities been notified about the phone then their actions may have been different and that may well have affected the escape of the prisoners. Her failure to notify authorities may have aided the escape. 'McCabe should have been aware of the serious nature of this. She was an experienced legal representative. She can’t have failed to have been aware of he serious impact of phones in prison.' In mitigation McCabe’s lawyer Rob Kearney said: 'She should have informed someone in her office and shouldn’t have sent those three texts in 13 minutes but the context is about a sentence he was going to receive. 'The SIM cards were seized a week before his escape. My client didn’t have anything to do with his escape. She certainly has been foolish but there wasn’t any serious criminality behind it.' McCabe will sentenced later this month. McDonald was jailed for seven years and ten months over the jewellery raids. He and his fellow inmate Steve McMullen, 31, are due to face court later over the escape.

Mr Libeskind, who designed Manchester’s Imperial War Museum North, was chosen to speak at the event in memory of budding architect Stephen, who was killed in a racist attack aged 18 in 1993. The Polish-born architect made a speech, entitled ‘Architecture and Memory’, at the Royal Institute of British Architects in London. Stephen Lawrence, who aspired to be an architect, was murdered 20 years ago this year . Mr Libeskind said: ‘I was honored to give the Stephen Lawrence Memorial Lecture this year. Clearly, racism, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, xenophobia and prejudices of all sorts are unacceptable in a democracy. ‘Forging a better future means fighting against the intrusions of these evils into society. Building a city of the future does not only involve building in concrete, steel and glass – but involves building a better civic society.’ Mr Libeskind designed the Jewish Museum in Berlin and the Military History Museum in Dresden; and faced off strong competition in his bid to reconstruct the World Trade Centre site. In his speech Daniel Libeskind said: 'Building a city of the future does not only involve building in concrete, steel and glass ¿ but involves building a better civic society.¿ . The lecture was the thirteenth of its kind to be held by the Trust, which aims to provide access and opportunities for people from disadvantaged backgrounds, especially minority ethnic and white working class young people. Previous speakers have included Prince Charles as well as Professor Chris Wise who designed the Olympic velodrome and RIBA Stirling Prize winning architect Zaha Hadid. The Trust awards bursaries to disadvantaged young people and has so far helped nine people to qualify as architects. It is seeking to expand to improve access to other professions such as law, finance and the media. Symon Sentain, Chair of the Stephen Lawrence Trust, said: ‘We were delighted to welcome Daniel Libeskind as our keynote speaker this year. ‘He is an inspiration to the young architects supported by the Trust’s bursary scheme.

A family judge has ruled that a man who shared a bed with his 13-year-old step-daughter - and even let her shave his chest - did nothing wrong. The step-father was cleared of abusing the girl by the judge at Swansea County Court after he claimed he got into bed with her when she was feeling ill and lonely, and let her shave him as part of a 'makeover.' Swansea Council took the case to London’s Appeal Court in a bid to vindicate the teenager who claimed she was a victim of abuse but those claims were rejected today by the Court of Appeal. Cleared: Three Court of Appeal judges ruled that the step-father had not done anything inappropriate . Lawyers for the council and the girl’s guardian claimed the decision contradicted the evidence and all conventions of decency with children. Charles Geekie QC, for Swansea, said the family judge was 'plainly wrong in refusing to find sexually inappropriate behaviour,' noting that the step-father had admitted sharing a bed with the teen 'on more than one occasion.' Although the man insisted that nothing inappropriate occurred, but Mr Geekie said he admitted on one occasion 'sharing a bed with her in the absence of her mother, and that he had proceeded to put his arm around her bare midriff.' Other alleged inappropriate conduct included 'showing an interest' in the girl’s pubic hair including joking about it needing a hedge trimmer and allowing the girl to pull down his trousers 'on at least four occasions', he added. The step-father steadfastly denied misconduct, insisting that his behaviour had to be seen in the context of the family’s particular domestic life and the teenager’s own precocious sexuality, behaviour which included exposing herself in public. Not a victim: The Court of Appeal supported the original ruling that . there were clearly 'poor sexual boundaries in the home' but the . stepfather had not committed abuse (file picture) He said the bed-sharing incident occurred when his step-daughter had returned ill from school and was feeling lonely. He told the court: 'I believe she asked to shave my chest, in the same way as she used to ask to do my hair or give me a makeover, so I let her do this. 'As she was still feeling poorly I put my arm around her stomach in order to comfort her and I fell asleep, touching her skin as her top had ridden up slightly.' The girl’s mother arrived home soon . after, he explained, adding that he never touched his stepdaughter . 'inappropriately or sexually' and today three top judges said the . believed his story. The . issue of alleged sex abuse was first aired before a family judge in . March this year who said that there were plainly 'poor sexual boundaries . in the home' but cleared the step-father of any wrong-doing. He . made an order that the girl should live with her mother under local . authority supervision but rejected all claims of sexual abuse. Challenging . that decision, Mr Geekie argued the teenager deserved a court ruling . that would vindicate her claims particularly because of the 'significant . emotional trauma within the family.' Mr Geekie said: 'She knows that a judge has now found as a fact that she was not abused. 'If, in truth, she was abused, it is important to her that this should be formally recorded. 'A . reversal of the findings will make a significant difference to her . well-being and the coherence and functioning of her family.' However, after several hours of intense legal debate, the three Appeal Court judges refused the council’s appeal. Lord . Justice Longmore, sitting with Lord Justice Underhill and Lady Justice . Macur, said that the court would give full reasons for its decision at a . later date.

Nurses and doctors do not need to treat patients with compassion, a controversial academic has claimed. Dr Anna Smajdor thinks staff should be able to carry out daily tasks – from removing someone’s appendix to feeding an elderly patient – without feeling any kindness towards them. She argued that compassion ‘is not a necessary component’ of healthcare and that staff who care too much about their patients would become demoralised if they witness neglect or poor treatment on wards. The standard of NHS care is currently . under intense scrutiny after a series of damning reports exposed . appalling neglect at some hospitals and care homes. Health . secretary Jeremy Hunt has implied such poor care is partly down to a . lack of compassion among staff and has warned that a ‘culture of . cruelty’ existed in certain organisations. In March, Mr Hunt called for all . student nurses to spend a year on wards carrying out basic tasks to . prove they are capable of caring. He also wants staff pay to be linked . to levels of kindness. But . Dr Smajdor – who lectures on ethics at the University of East Anglia, in . Norwich – believes that compassion will not solve any problems in the . NHS. Dr Anna Smajdor claims doctors and nurses should be able to carry out everyday tasks - from removing someone's appendix to feeding an elderly patient - without feeling any kindness towards them (file pic) Writing in the journal Clinical Ethics, she said: ‘Compassion is not a necessary component of healthcare, since the crucial tasks associated with healthcare can be carried out in the absence of compassion. ‘One can remove an appendix without caring about the person it is taken from, empty a bedpan without caring about the patient who has filled it, or provide food without caring about the person who will eat it. Health secretary Jeremy Hunt has claimed the poor standard of NHS care is partly down to a lack of compassion among staff. He has warned that a 'culture of cruelty' exists in certain organisations . ‘Unless we regard healthcare professionals as saints, we cannot demand that they guarantee an unlimited flow of compassion for each patient. Indeed, it is not only unfair, but dangerous to do so.’ She went on to say that those ‘who feel compassion’ may become ‘deeply distressed’ if they witness poor care on wards, adding: ‘For this reason, the compassionate healthcare worker may be at risk of suffering burnout, fatigue, becoming desensitised, damaged and ultimately dangerous in the healthcare system.’ A Department of Health spokesman disputed Dr Smajdor’s remarks yesterday, saying: ‘Compassion is a vital element of good patient care. Many nurses represent NHS values at their finest and we let them down when poor care is not tackled.’ And Dr Peter Carter, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing said: ‘There are many factors which impact on the quality of care patients receive and compassion will always play a crucial role in nursing.’ Dr Smajdor is an expert on controversial topics in health and science including IVF, egg donation and cloning. Last year she called for children to be created in artificial wombs in labs – as she claimed it was unfair that only women went through the pain and suffering of childbirth. Hospitals should put up signs saying how many nurses are working on wards to combat concerns about unsafe staffing levels, MPs have suggested. A report from the health select committee said hospital managers should follow the example set by Salford Royal Foundation Trust in Greater Manchester, where the signs have been used since May. They want every ward to have a whiteboard saying how many nurses should be on duty, the number of nurses on shift at the time as well as the number scheduled to work overnight. This would alert relatives, patients and healthcare professionals to potentially dangerous staffing levels, allowing them to demand hospital bosses bring more nurses on shift. Committee chairman and Tory MP Stephen Dorrell said: ‘If we get to the point where there are several people challenging this rather than nobody challenging then we have made some progress. ‘What I would say is look at what they do in Salford. It’s the whole issue in the health service about recognising good practice and either doing it that way or finding a better way of delivering the same result.’","Dr Anna Smajdor claims compassion is 'not a necessary component' of healthcare .

Victim: Amina Bibi was found by her 11-year-old son having suffered multiple stab wounds at her home in Forest Gate, east London on Friday . A schoolboy pleaded with a neighbour to 'help my mum, help my mum' after he returned home from school to collect his homework and found his mother had been murdered. The 11-year-old boy desperately banged on his neighbour's door on Friday morning looking for help after he found Amina Bibi, 43, in a pool of blood at her flat in Forest Gate, east London. The boy, who was being walked to school by his father, had returned home to pick up his homework and it is thought that he may have disturbed Mrs Bibi's killer by ringing the doorbell. She had suffered multiple stab wounds. Detectives have today said that Mrs Bibi's murder may have a 'domestic element' to it. They have so far arrested two men in connection with the killing. They are being questioned at an east London police station this afternoon. Neighbour Jamal Omar, 41, said the boy came knocking on his door, screaming for help, moments after he let him into the block of flat via the intercom system. The father-of-two said: 'He came banging on my door, shouting for help. When I opened the door he said ""help my mum. I don’t know what’s wrong with her"". 'I went next door with him and saw Amina lying face down on the floor, covered in blood. 'I rang 999 and they told me to revive her but it was too late for me to do anything. 'She was a lovely woman. The family have lived here at long as we have, we’ve known each other for 10 years. 'It’s such a terrible thing. They are a good family, nobody deserves this. 'I haven’t seen her husband or children since it happened.' Detective Chief Inspector David Whellams, who is leading the investigation into Mrs Bibi's death, added: 'As the son entered the flat he found the body of his mother. Crime scene: Mrs Bibi was found dead at her home in Forest Gate, east London, on Friday morning . 'The son contacted the dad who returned and by the time he got back the ambulance crew had arrived. 'The family at the moment are bearing-up as well as they can after this tragedy. The children are very upset and are being looked after by relatives.' Police believe that Mrs Bibi's killer would have been covered in blood when he fled her east London flat. Detective Chief Inspector Whellams said: 'From intelligence we believe he has run to the back of the block of flats and away, as a blood trail in the flat suggests they left by the back of the property. 'We have a CCTV image that looks like he was carrying some sort of garment or cloth, like a jacket, towel or other clothing. 'We believe he would have been very noticeable and appeal for anyone who saw him to get in touch. At that time of day there were kids being dropped off at the school and there were people on their way to work as he ran down the road. 'People also need to look out for any discarded garments or items that may be covered in blood.' Confirming that a 64-year-old man and a man in his forties had been arrested and are being questioned by police, a Scotland Yard spokesman said this afternoon: 'This is a complex and fast moving investigation and one current line of inquiry is that the murder may have a domestic element.'

Firemen are set to walk out across England and Wales for the first time in 10 years over changes to their pension scheme. They will strike for four hours next Wednesday after almost 80 per cent of the Fire Brigades Union voted in favour of industrial action. The unions warned that the strike could be the first of many – with another potentially on Bonfire Night. Industrial action: Firefighters will down tools in their first nationwide strike for a decade next week in a row over pensions . Although there have been local . disputes in recent years, it is the first time for a decade that firemen . have voted in favour of a national walkout. Ministers . insisted that contingency plans were in place, and pledged that all 999 . calls would be answered. The service will be kept running by part-time . fire crews who are not part of the FBU. In some areas, trained . volunteers will be called upon to help out. There . will be no Green Goddesses on the streets, as in previous strikes, . because since 2004 it has been the role of fire and rescue authorities . rather than government to provide cover in the event of industrial . action. Most of the Green Goddesses – Army appliances used to respond to . 999 calls – have been sold to brigades in Africa. Dangerous: The FBU say that it is 'ludicrous' to expect firefighters to work to the age of 60 before they receive a full pension (file picture) Matt . Wrack, general secretary of the FBU, said the strike is ‘a warning . shot’ to the Government. ‘Firefighters could not be more serious about . protecting public safety and ensuring fair pensions,’ he said. Strike: General secretary of the FBU, Matt Wrack, said that the industrial action is a 'warning shot' to the Government . The . dispute centres on the pensions paid to firemen over 50 who are forced . to retire early after failing to meet the required fitness standards. The union says thousands are threatened with the sack and paid a reduced . pension simply because they are getting older. It wants them to be paid . a full pension. A . government review found that more than half of firefighters between the . ages of 50  and 54 cannot meet fire  and rescue service fitness . standards for fighting fires, while two thirds of those beyond the age . of 55 fail to meet the standards. The retirement age is 60. The FBU claims that its members pay some of the highest pension contributions in the public or private sector. Fire . minister Brandon Lewis described the strike as ‘entirely unnecessary’ and that ‘robust’ contingency plans are in place. ‘The pension on offer . to firefighters is one of the most generous public service pensions . available,’ he said. ‘A . firefighter who earns £29,000, and retires after a full career aged 60 . will get a £19,000 a year pension, rising to £26,000 with the state . pension. ‘To get the same pension from a private scheme firefighters would have to contribute twice as much.’ Last week, the Trades Union Congress approved a ‘day of action’ on November 5.

Britain's union leaders branded Ed Miliband a ‘schoolboy’ yesterday – and warned the Labour leader he was ‘living in cloud cuckoo land’ if he thought his party reforms would succeed. Dave Prentis, general-secretary of Unison, said Britain’s biggest public sector union would cut its annual funding to Labour by £210,000 after the number of members saying they wanted their fees to go to the party plummeted. He also claimed Mr Miliband’s reforms would lead to a landslide defeat in the next election. Critical: Unison boss Dave Prentis trashed Ed Miliband's new reforms, saying it will lead to his union cutting Labour funds by £210,000 per year . Mr Prentis said Unison would simply ignore the Labour leader’s proposed reforms to the historic links between the unions and the party, whatever the conclusion of a special conference to be held on the issue in the spring. ‘If the powers that be both in the Labour party and the trade union movement believe that having squabbles and a special conference is going to get our members to vote Labour, they are living in cloud cuckoo land,’ he said. Mr Miliband will issue a defiant pledge to press ahead with his reforms when he addresses the TUC tomorrow. They include ending the system under which millions of union members automatically pay affiliation fees to Labour even if they do not support the party. Under Mr Miliband’s changes, they would have to ‘opt in’ before their money could be handed over. Many Labour figures are warning the move could cripple Labour financially. GMB general secretary Paul Kenny fired . an angry broadside at Mr Miliband’s ‘opt in’ proposals, saying they . appeared to have been ‘dusted down from some drawer of a schoolboy . project’. Mr Kenny said it was ‘inevitable’ union donations to Labour – worth £9 million a year – would ‘plummet’ if . Mr Miliband presses ahead with reforms designed to weaken the party’s . link with the unions. Mr Prentis also said Mr Miliband was . creating divisions which could see Labour go down to the kind of . landslide defeat suffered by its sister party in Australia at the . weekend. The move by Unison comes days after the GMB cut its funding to . the party by more than £1million a year. As . the Trades Union Congress got under way in Bournemouth yesterday, the . giant Unite union also appeared to suggest it could follow suit unless . Mr Miliband agrees to drag Labour further to the Left, saying he had . failed to ‘close the deal’ with traditional supporters. General-secretary Len McCluskey’s demands include a 75 per cent top tax . rate, the renationalisation of swathes of industry and the reversal of . Margaret Thatcher’s union reforms. Big demands: UNITE General-secretary Len McCluskey¿s wants Mr Miliband to promise a 75 per cent top tax rate and the reversal of Margaret Thatcher¿s union reforms . He said: ‘Ed Miliband’s challenge now is to genuinely demonstrate to ordinary working people, including trade unionists, that he is on our side.’ Mr McCluskey said Unite had been . ‘vindicated’ by Mr Miliband’s humiliating climbdown over allegations . that the union tried to fix the outcome of a Labour selection meeting in . the safe seat of Falkirk. Mr Miliband infuriated Unite by calling in police to investigate claims the union had signed up local activists as party members without their knowledge to stuff the constituency with union supporters. On Friday night, Labour stated there was no evidence of wrongdoing and reinstated two Unite activists who had been suspended. But senior Labour sources claimed key evidence had been ‘withdrawn’ and suggested people may have come under pressure from fellow Unite members to drop their claims. ‘No one should be claiming vindication,’ the source said. In a sign of growing concern among Labour’s high command, the party’s deputy leader Harriet Harman will make a desperate plea to union barons to stick with them. At the TUC conference tonight, she is expected to say: ‘I am proud of the link between the Labour party and the trade unions. 'I do not want it weakened. Nor does Ed. We want to see it strengthened and deepened. ‘If we don’t have unity, there is going to be winners and losers. T . 'he winners will be the Tories and the losers will be our constituents and your members. This is a dangerous moment.’ David Blunkett warned that Mr Miliband’s speech to the TUC tomorrow marked a ‘a critical juncture in his leadership’. The former Home Secretary warned ‘the entire Labour project could be jeopardised’ if he failed to ‘recharge our economic and foreign policies’. Labour MP Jim Sheridan said: ‘This is a big, big gamble by Ed Miliband, I think he’s doing the wrong thing and I’ve told him that. Ed Miliband and Len McCluskey will come and go but the Labour Party must remain.’","Unison leader criticises Ed Miliband's 'opt in' reform for party support .

A health and safety executive who crashed into a teenage girl on a moped and left her to be run over and killed by a minibus was today jailed for six years. Brian Hampton was serving a ban for drink-driving when he smashed his £40,000 Volvo XC90 4X4 into the back of Jade Clark’s scooter. The former paramedic swerved around Jade as she was thrown into the carriageway and carried on without stopping. Road death: Jade Clark. 16, was killed after . Brian Hampton, sketched in court, hit her with his 4X4 before she was . run over and killed by a minibus, a court heard . Moments later an oncoming minibus run over the trainee hairdresser, killing her instantly. Hampton, 58, was caught on a hotel security camera inspecting the damage to the front of his silver Volvo the morning after the horrific crash. He went on to spin a web of lies to the police and his wife, claiming he had run over a pot hole or hit a deer, and paid £4,300 to get the damage hastily repaired. He had previously admitted a charge of causing death by careless driving and was jailed for two years. He was found guilty of perverting the course of justice by trying to cover it up, for which he was jailed for four years. The sentences are to run consecutively. In a victim impact statement read out on her behalf, Jade’s mum Sharon said she has nightmares of her daughter lying in the road calling for her mother and that she still blames herself for buying Jade the scooter. CCTV: Brian Hampton (left) was caught on camera checking the front of his silver Volvo XC90 the day after mowing down 16-year-old Jade Clark . She said: 'It is almost unbearable and I hope she didn’t suffer. No punishment will be suitable and none will bring Jade back.' In . sentencing Hampton at Bournemouth Crown Court Judge Samuel Wiggs told . him: 'You have shown yourself to be a consistent liar as much as you . were a consistent driver even after your disqualification. 'By . your own behaviour you have caused devastation to many people. You have . devastated the immediate family and other friends and relatives as . well.' Earlier today a . shocked jury at Bournemouth Crown Court were shown the footage this . morning in which Hampton is seen examining the £40,000 4X4’s broken . front grill and then spending five minutes trying to get its bonnet . open. Debris: The shattered remains of Jade's moped after a crash the prosecution say was caused by Hampton who then fled . The previous evening Hampton, a . railway health and safety executive, slammed into the back of Jade’s . moped, sending her flying into the carriageway the court was told . The trainee hairdresser, who had been on her way to a friend's party was then hit by an oncoming minibus and died instantly from severe head injuries. The prosecution told the court how Jade Clark's scooter was 'swallowed up . and fragmented into hundreds of pieces' by Hampton's Volvo 4X4 . after he ploughed into the back of it. But Hampton, . 58, who was serving a drink-driving ban at the time, . swerved around her before speeding off without stopping. The court heard Hampton struck Jade's scooter as he drove along the A31 in Ringwood, Hampshire, on February 24. Crash scene: Police investigators look at the duel carriageway near Ringwood, Hampshire, after a smash that claimed the like of 16-year-old Jade . Chain of events: Jade was knocked into the road and died instantly from severe head injuries when a minibus followed . But his wife Maureen took to the witness stand to tell jurors she had no idea her husband had been banned from driving for 26 months after a drink drive conviction at the time of the accident. Following Hampton’s arrest on March 21 this year he wrote a letter to her explaining he had been too scared to tell her he had been disqualified. He wrote: 'I swear with all my heart I did not hit that poor girl on the scooter.' Simon Jones, prosecuting, said: 'Jade fell into the middle of the carriageway and the defendant swerved around her. That left her exposed to the fast moving traffic. 'Her moped was swallowed up and pushed along the carriageway.' Mr Jones said motorist John Ward was driving a VW minibus and had no time to react before hitting Jade, a trainee hairdresser from Ringwood in the New Forest. He added: 'He drove over what he initially believed to be debris and caused catastrophic head injuries and instant death. 'The moped was fragmented into hundreds of pieces. 'Brian Hampton had already driven off effectively leaving Jade and the scene of a fatal road collision. Case: Brian Hampton is on trial for perverting the course of justice after allegedly lying to cover up his part in the crash . 'It was his duty to stop. 'What . the defendant did was to seek to evade justice and pervert the course . of justice by arranging for the damage to his vehicle to be subsequently . repaired. 'He did this . with one purpose in mind - that being to ensure there could be no link . between him, his vehicle and the collision that occurred on the A31 that . day.' Hampton drove his damaged vehicle to the Premier Inn in Poole where he had been booked in by his employers, railway company Signalling Solutions, the court heard. He emailed his manager at 4am the following day saying he couldn't attend work because he had swollen feet. He then told his wife Maureen that his car had broken down and he had to wait several days for a recovery truck to tow it back to his home in Kent, it is alleged. But later that day he secretly drove to Ashford near his home town of Shadoxhurst where he took his car to a garage then stayed in a nearby Holiday Inn for two nights, the jury heard. Tributes: The flowers left for Jade Clark at Ringwood Fire station, close to the scene of the crash . Terrible: Trainee hairdresser jade was sent flying into the middle of the dual carriageway, where she was killed . Grief: Jade Clark's mother Sharon Clark is comforted by her husband Daniel Clark during a press conference at the time of her death . Mechanics replaced the car's bonnet, grill, radiator, sump shield, bumper and number plate but raised concerns because there had been no blood or fur on the car. When officers swooped on his home on March 21, Hampton told them he had no idea why he was being arrested. The court heard he told officers he had not seen or been involved in an incident, then later admitted he had seen a crash but had not been involved. He also denied getting his car repaired then later conceded he had. During a police interview he said: 'I have told you lots of porkies but one thing I did not tell porkies about was I did not hit that young lady.' Mr Jones said a series of CCTV images of Hampton's car prior to the incident showed the grill trim in tact, while photos taken after showed it to be broken following a collision. Incident: Hampton drove a Silver Volvo XC 90 like this one, and then paid £4,300 to get it repaired, jury hears . Hampton was also caught on camera checking the front of his vehicle at the Premier Inn in Poole, and told staff when he left that he couldn't get the bonnet open. Mr Jones said: 'There can be no other credible explanation for the repair other than for this defendant to distance himself from the collision and subsequent detection of his involvement.' PC Clifton Beard, a crash investigator, told the court Jade’s scooter had been wedged into the front of Hampton’s car and pushed up to 70ft. He said: 'Although we are not talking about a massive impact, we are still talking about a forceful impact. That would have sent a significant jolt through the Volvo.' Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Brian Hampton, 58, jailed for causing death by careless driving and perverting the course of justice .

Tim Maddox, 47, who runs the tea room with his wife Ayla, said: 'We have run the tea rooms for 11 years and it is a fantastic little corner of the world here.

The photo appears to show six members of . the team running naked along the side of a road in front of a large . coach without a stitch of clothing between them save their socks and . trainers. It was taken during what has been described as an initiation ceremony to mark the start of the new season and accompanied by the words: 'Senior initiations #blueblood.' Although some runners can be seen using their hands to protect their modesty others appear more relaxed about letting it all hang out and look as though they are simply enjoying a good training run. The naked tweet was hastily deleted yesterday but not before being shared all across the internet and making it onto local news sites. 'Initiations' of new team mates have long been an integral part of most rugby clubs with some of the more disgusting ones only occasionally making it into the media. Most are considered a bit of fun and are held strictly behind closed doors but typically they involve a heavy drinking and a certain level of ritualistic humiliation . Mumbles RFC: 'A rugby club for big strong boys, who look good and smell nice' In 2011 England star Chris Ashton revealed how as a new member of the squad he too had been required undergo 'initiation.' After his debut in a match against France he was ordered to sink an alcoholic drink with every member of the 22-strong squad in just a couple of hours. The result, he admitted, left him 'battered' but pales in comparison with the antics of some amateur sides who evidently devote more time to planning their drinking than their match play. In 2011 a group of six students from the University of Gloucestershire were caught ‘performing sex acts’ on the top of a bus as part of the club initiation ceremony. Their debauchery was witnessed by members of the public including teenage girls and resulted in all six being given 160 day long community orders banning them from entering pubs or bars and from drinking in public. In a similar instance the rugby club at De Montfort University in Leicester was charged by the sport's governing body, the Rugby Football Union, following the discovery that players were being forced play naked and blindfolded and jump into a paddling pool filled with urine.","Mumbles RFC near Swansea tweeted the picture to its 750 followers calling it 'seniors initiation'

A fugitive killer who fled Britain was brought to justice after he was accidentally hit by a passenger train whilst on the run in Holland. Joseph Davies, 36, was today jailed for a minimum of 22 years at Manchester Crown Court for the murder of his ex-girlfriend Kelly Davies. Davies had fled the country by Eurostar after he stabbed Ms Davies in the throat and neck 22 times during a row at her home in Bolton. Joseph Davies, right, today received a life sentence for the murder of Kelly Davies, left. He stabbed Ms Davies 22 times just one day after being released from prison for burglary. But police were preparing to hunt for Davies abroad, he got drunk and staggered into the path of a tram at the Hague and was crushed under the wheels. He was so badly hurt that his right leg had to be amputated at the knee – and when he woke up in hospital, Davies found himself under arrest for murder. He was later extradited to England to stand trial. A court heard that after the murder of 31-year-old Kelly Davies – who has the same surname name as her killer by coincidence - her small daughter was found clutching her doll and standing by the body of her mother, where she had lain dead for up to two days. Davies killed his ex-girlfriend the day after he had finished a prison sentence for burglary. The court heard he was freed from Haverigg prison in Cumbria on the morning of June 1 last year and travelled to Bolton to meet Ms Davies, with whom he had three children during a stormy long-term relationship. Ms Davies had been told by authorities that she would not be able to take her care of her youngest child, then aged 18 months, if she continued her relationship with Davies. Kelly Davies was found murdered in her house in Bolton, pictured, on June 4 last year . Family friend Vincent Walmsley told jurors that Davies had accused Kelly of seeing other men while he was in prison, and had threatened to ‘chop her up and throw her in the river.’ He found her dead in her flat on June 4, and tests showed that she had been dead for two days. The court heard the killing had occurred on June 2 shortly before Davies was seen leaving her flat at 11pm and getting in a taxi to Manchester Airport. He then paid £400 for a taxi to London, . where he caught a Eurostar train to Lille. He was arrested on June 8 . after officers were told about his accident with the train. Ms Davies was found by a family friend after she had lain dead for two days . After the case Elizabeth Reed of the Crown Prosecution Service said: ‘Joseph Davies thought that he could evade capture by fleeing to Holland following his brutal attack on Kelly Davies, leaving their daughter in the house with her mother’s body for two days. 'The CPS has worked hard with the police and the Dutch authorities to ensure that Davies was brought back to this country to face the charge of murder. 'Today, justice has been served and the defendant must now face up to the consequences of his horrific crime. 'Senior Investigating Officer Andy Tattersall said: “This is a tragic case that has left three children without a mum. Davies is a violent bully who attacked and killed the mother of his children and the woman he professed to love. 'He thought he could run away and not face the consequences of his barbaric actions.'","Joseph Davies, 36, stabbed his ex-girlfriend 22 times then fled to Holland .

A heroic Washington Navy Yard employee has recounted the moment he raced to the aid of a blind co-worker as bullets rang out around them before leading him to safety. Omar Grant was photographed holding the arm of his colleague, identified only as Linwood, and leading him away from the building after Aaron Alexis opened fire on Monday morning, killing 12. The touching image, captured by a Yahoo! News reporter at the scene, has already become a symbol of the astonishing acts of kindness and bravery amid such terror. Grant, an IT technician, recalled how he had just arrived at work and was standing in the atrium when he heard bullets echoing through the Navy Yard complex. He froze as people began running. Support: He continued to tell Linwood where they were going and that he would not leave him alone . 'As soon as we got outside the cafeteria . doors into the hallway, we saw people panicked, running for the exits,' Grant told the Today show. 'They were shouting. I couldn't make out exactly what they were . shouting, but I knew it was something serious.' But his first thought was not for himself; he was near a visually-impaired colleague with a walking stick who was struggling to get away from the scene. 'He moves sometimes rather slowly so people are usually helping him and escorting him,' Grant told CBS. 'This time, he was all by himself. I did not want to leave him behind.' Grant approached Linwood and held on to his arm. 'I said, ""This is what we are going to do,"" and I'm describing where we were going,' Grant said. 'I told myself, ""I'm not going to leave you, we're going to get out of here"".' Heroic: Omar Grant, pictured, said he told Linwood he would not leave him and led him to the train station .

Sheila Eddy, 17, prepares to plead not guilty to stabbing her one-time best friend as she appears in Monongalia County Court in Morgantown, West Virginia, on Tuesday . A West Virginia teen accused of stabbing her best friend to death has pleaded not guilty to first degree murder in court. Seventeen-year-old Shelia Eddy also denied conspiracy and kidnapping charges when she appeared in Monongalia County court on Tuesday. Prosecutors say Eddy plotted the murder with Rachel Shoaf, then the two girl lured Skylar Neese out of her house in 2012 and stabbed her to death. The body was stashed under some branches in the woods across the Pennsylvania border. A potential motive has yet to be revealed. Tuesday's trial was the first time the victim's family had seen Eddy. Judge Russell M. Clawges, Jr. set a trial date of October 22. Eddy's name first became public this month, when prosecutors transferred her case from juvenile to adult court. Shoaf, meanwhile, has pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and is awaiting sentencing. Investigators found Earl-Neese's Neese's . body six months after the horrific slaying, but only after Shoaf . confessed to the brutal murder. The slain girl's father had hoped previously that Eddy would plead guilty, thus avoiding a revealing trial. What went wrong?: The three girls were said to be inseparable friends before Neese was stabbed to death because the two teens allegedly no longer liked her . 'I don't want to hear the grisly . details of how Skylar was murdered,' Dave Neese said. 'I don't want to . hear how she screamed and cried. But I do want these girls to get what . they deserve.' Proceedings will be held in open court going forward, prosecutors announced this week. Cold blooded? Shelia Eddy, 16, pleaded not guilty to first degree murder and will be tried as an adult . Prosecutors have said they will recommend Shoaf receive a 20-year sentence, but the confessed killer faces as much as 40 years behind bars. Court documents offer no insight into the motive for the crime. WDTV reported that Dave Neese stated: 'They didn't like her anymore. That's the only response I got. 'I want a reason, I want some kind of reason (for this to) happen. There is no reason I don't care if you have the best reason in the world, but there's no reason (for this to happen).' Neese added of Rachel Shoaf: 'I feel bad for your parents and I hope you rot in hell.' The victim was last seen on surveillance video leaving her family's apartment voluntarily and getting into a car on July 6, 2012. She was initially considered a runaway, but her parents soon suspected she was abducted. Police chased numerous leads with no luck. The break finally came when Shoaf admitted plotting with another girl to kill her – shocking even the investigators working the case. 'They look as normal as any other kid that you could ever see,' said barber BJ McClead. 'Not kids you would think would have anything to do with anything like this.' It's unclear how long the three girls had been friends or just how close they were. Surveillance . video showed her getting into a car at the end of her street in a quiet . residential neighborhood near West Virginia University. With no sign of fear, no money and no contact lenses, she apparently expected to return. 'Best friend': Sheila Eddy tweeted a tribute to Skylar Neese in March - almost a year after she went missing . Accused killers: Eddy (right) makes faces with confessed killed Shoaf while tweeting a picture that describes their friendship . Friends: Rachel Shoaf (on the right in both pictures) has confessed to stabbing Skylar Neese (left) to death last summer . Tragic: Police chased numerous leads in trying to find Neese with no luck. Until Shoaf came forward . Skylar Neese disappeared in July 2012 and was . initially thought to be a runaway but her parents soon suspected she had . been abducted . Shoaf's family issued a public apology through a lawyer but has made no further statements. 'There is no way to describe the pain that we, too, are feeling,' they said. 'We . are truly sorry for the pain that she has caused the Neese family, and . we know her actions are unforgivable and inexcusable. 'Our daughter has admitted her involvement and she has accepted responsibility for her actions. 'Our hearts are broken for your loss,' they told the Neese family, 'and we are still trying to come to terms with this event.' Mary . Neese has declined interview requests. But the family has tried to . spare others their agony, persuading legislators to pass 'Skylar's Law' earlier this year. Shock: In Star City, West Virginia, the community was shaken. Barber BJ McClead (pictured) said of the accused: 'They look as normal as any other kid that you could ever see.' Mystery: People in the small West Virginia town had wondered for months about Skylar Neese. She vanished after slipping out the bedroom of her Star City home in July 2012 .

The former restrooms, which have just come on the market for redevelopment, are just a short drive from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s former secret home on Anglesey. The toilets, in a “stunning seafront location”, are just 20 miles from the love nest the couple called home for their first years of marriage. The public toilets come with a stunning view of the north Welsh coast which William and Kate, inset, enjoyed for the three years they lived on Anglesey . The buildings come with planning permission and are ready to be transformed into a dream house like the secluded Anglesey farmhouse William and Kate have recently moved from after three years. But buyers will have to spend more than a penny to land their dream home, the property is expected to fetch between £80,000 and £100,000. Gareth Williams, estate agent at Dafydd Hardy, said: “This is an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and site of scientific interest, and one of the best places in the UK for wildlife. “It’s a great opportunity for a developer, someone needing a home, or a buyer looking for a holiday cottage investment in a location without equal. “We use the word “unique” a lot - but it genuinely applies here.” There is permission to convert the stone building into a two-bedroom home, with space for gardens, parking, and sweeping sea views. Vacant: The former toilets, which are currently empty, could be turned into a dream bolthole. In need of repair: the former public restrooms will be in need of some work if they are to come close to the Duke and Duchess' former royal retreat. The toilets boast panoramic views of Anglesey’s western coast to Snowdonia and down the Lln Peninsula and Bardsey island. The public convenience was closed by the local authority last year as part of a closure programme to save more than £30,000 a year.","Royal couple lived just a short drive away from the now empty public loos .

Jerry Brown signs leglislation approved by the Senate. The controversial bill AB711 is supported not just by environmentalists who say lead is deadly for the endangered condor, but also by those who say fragments of the bullets may be eaten by animals and end up in the food chain, endangering humans. However gun lobbyists including the National Rifle Association (NRA) say the proposed ban would lead to job losses and a reduction in hunting licenses which pay for conservation projects, while replacement copper bullets would be much more expensive. Meat fears: Governor Jerry Brown may make California the first state with a ban on hunting with lead bullets . There is already a ban on hunting with lead bullets in eight counties in California where the population of the pre-historic condors is considered in danger, but if Gov. Brown signs AB711, it will be extended state-wide. The bill, proposed by Assemblymen Anthony Rendon and Richard Pan, is designed to protect not just California's condors, eagles and other wildlife from lead poisoning, but also humans, for whom they 'there is no safe level of lead exposure'. There are fears the lead from spent bullets may be making its way into hunted meat that is then eaten by humans.  Environmentalists say there is so much lead in meat that has come from hunting that women and pregnant children should not eat it. 'There's no reason to keep putting toxic lead into the food chain or risking human health when there are nontoxic bullets already on the market and in use by hunters,', Jeff Miller, a conservation advocate from the Center for Biological Diversity, told mercurynews.com. Backer of the bill Dan Taylor, of Audubon California, said there were plenty of alternative metals to make bullets from. 'AB711 is a milestone in the effort to protect wildlife', he told sfgate.com. 'We've removed lead from gasoline, paint and children's toys.  It's clear that lead ammunition has no place in hunting when safer and more effective alternatives are available.' Deadly ammunition: Supporters of the bill say lead from bullets could end up in edible meat (file picture) There is already a ban on lead bullets in eight counties in California with an endangered condor population . However the powerful pro-gun lobby is fighting a fierce campaign to stop the law going through, trying to discredit the study the health fears are based on and citing the lack of many alternative bullets for hunters. NRA lawyer Chuck Michel said copper bullets were more expensive and could cause wildfires because they spark more than lead bullets. He also said condors could be poisoned by waste they scavenge on in dump sites in more urban areas, adding: 'The point is, there are alternate sources of lead in the environment which are probably the source of the lead.' Gov. Brown has until 12 October to sign the legislation, and if he does, it will not come into force until mid-2019.","Controversial bill AB711 proposes state-wide ban on lead hunting bullets .

A school has banned pupils from bringing their bikes through the gates - and is planning to demolish cycle racks to make way for more staff parking. Children at Risca Primary School, in Newport, South Wales, have been told they now have to chain their bikes up off its premises because of health and safety concerns. But parents have criticised the move saying it will be dangerous for their children with more cars driving near the site and are outraged the ban has been enforced at the same time the school is building more parking spaces. Health and safety: Children from Risca Primary School in Newport, South Wales who are no longer allowed onto school grounds with their bikes . Mother Ceri Jeffries, 32, has three 10-year-olds at the school and admitted she was surprised staff had taken . the decision considering its 'eco' status. Her children normally cycle together with four others, cutting their twenty minute walk down to a five-minute bike ride. She said: 'The school is an eco-friendly school but has decided that . children are no longer allowed to cycle to and from school, even though . children have been doing this for years, including myself as a child.' Her daughter came home and told her a teacher had announced  the bike sheds were going to be taken away to make way for a new car park. 'As soon as she told me this I called up the school and spoke to the deputy head teacher who confirmed this,' she added. 'This has upset a lot of children . and their parents. Childhood obesity is on the rise and promoting . healthy eating and exercise is a must,' she said. Regulations: Pupils at the school are still cycling, but the planned demolition of the bike shelter means they will have to chain them up outside . 'What better way to promote this by encouraging children to cycle to school and by doing so reducing the amount of cars, making it safer for children and the environment?' 'The parents parking their cars outside the gates is going to cause more of a health and safety risk than a few bikes.' Rachel Guy, the mother of two children at the school, said she met with head teacher Jayne Arthur to discuss the policy. 'I said to Mrs Arthur, ""It’s . absolutely ridiculous."" She said it’s a health and safety issue. My . kids rode yesterday, to make a stand really. I’m hoping they haven’t . been told off.' Banned: Staff at Risca Primary School say the rules have been brought in because of health and safety concerns . The school holds a cycling safety course each year when pupils bring their bikes to school for three weeks. Mrs Guy added: 'I also asked if safety measures are to be put into place for this short time, why can’t they be put into place permanently? This apparently isn’t an option.' Headteacher Jayne Arthur said: 'We are currently working alongside the council’s Road Safety and Health and Safety teams to review the situation and complete risk assessment and traffic survey of the school site. 'Ensuring the safety and well being of our pupils remains our utmost priority, and we are seeking to resolve this issue as soon as possible.' A spokeswoman for Caerphilly Council said the council did not want to issue an official statement, adding: 'I’m aware of the situation.

Opponents may say some of his policy ideas are on the thin side, but George Osborne is doing his utmost to make sure his hair is not. The Chancellor was yesterday seen sporting a new style, with his hair brushed forward to cover up signs of a receding hairline. The choppy, layered cut is used by hairdressers to make it seem as though their clients’ hair is thicker than it really is, in turn helping them look younger. On view: The Chancellor's receding hairline could previously be seen (left), but the younger style (right) gives an impression of more hair on top of his head . It seems to have worked for Mr Osborne. The new style appeared to have taken a few years off the 42-year-old, who was seen in June with thin and greying hair. Mr Osborne was speaking to Lloyds Banking staff in Birmingham after the sale of taxpayer-owned shares. The Chancellor has hailed the £61million profit on the sale of the shares as more evidence the economy was 'turning a corner'. Mr Osborne claimed the £3.2 billion sale of a 6 per cent slice of the bank to institutional investors represented a half-billion pound boost to the public accounts - because of the way it is valued on the Government's books. Snip and tuck: Mr Osborne was speaking to Lloyds Banking staff in Birmingham after the sale of taxpayer-owned shares . He indicated that the disposal of the rest of the Treasury's holding, now standing at 32.7 per cent, may be opened up to the public in a stock market float likely to revive memories of the major privatisations of the 1980s. It comes five years to the day after then-Lloyds TSB stepped in to swallow up troubled Halifax Bank of Scotland during the financial crisis in a disastrous move that saw it needing to be rescued itself in a £20 billion Government bail-out. The first tranche of the re-privatisation saw financial institutions mainly from the UK and United States snap up stock at a price of 75p per share, above the 73.6p average price that had been paid for it by the Treasury. Talk: The new style appeared to have taken a few years off Mr Osborne, 42, who was seen in June with thin and greying hair . In a letter to Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Commons Treasury Committee, Mr Osborne said: 'This is a good outcome for the taxpayer. 'It represents a major milestone on the road from rescue to recovery for the British economy, and in further normalising the banking sector. 'This is the first in a multi-staged sale programme.

Google Street View has been criticised by a Home Office minister after he was captured walking along a London street. Lib Dem Jeremy Browne said he was alarmed at the 'intrusiveness' of images on the website and questioned why more was not done to hide the identities of people photographed by the firm's cameras. He said the Google cars which tour roads throughout Britain were 'unnerving' and suggested the private firms should face more regulation. Standing out: Home Office minister Jeremy Browne has been captured on Google Street view carrying his ministerial red box in London . Media darling: Mr Browne has made headlines during the Lib Dem conference with remarks on immigration, religious veils and the future of the party . Captured walking near Paddington railway . station, it is thought he was rushing to catch a train to his Taunton . constituency when he was snapped by the Street View cameras. He told MailOnline: 'They are meant to make it impossible to identify the person. It would not be very hard to work out it was me.' Mr Browne is seen as one of the leading voices on the right of the Lib Dems, urging his party to ‘grow up’ and not be ‘bashful’ about being in government. His run of media appearances and staunch defence of remaining in government has seen him emerge as a strong contender for the party leadership, to the irritation of left wing members. One leading left wing minister dismissed the leadership talk: 'If he is on manoeuvres they will have to be very long ones.' In recent days he has dismissed fears about an influx of immigrants from eastern Europe and called for a national debate on banning religious veils in some circumstances. Now he has questioned the level of privacy regulation governing private firms who take images of members of the public. He told journalists: 'I think there is an issue about the intrusiveness of modern technology. It is why the government is right to be alert to the public concern about excessive use of CCTV. 'We need to get the balance right with using technology to prevent crime and people not feeling that every time they enter a public space their movements will be potentially permanently recorded. 'I do find the surveillance vehicles with cameras on top slightly unnerving when they drive past. 'Campaigners are always most alert to the threats to individual liberties that can be caused by the state but we also need to be guarded about how the evolution of technology means that private organisations can also intrude into individual privacy in a way that many people would find unsettling. 'Quite often the state is more regulated than private organisations.' Stroll: Mr Browne, tipped as a potential future leader, was seen outside the Hilton hotel near Paddington station . Manoeuvres: Mr Browne's media profile has seen him emerge as a potential leadership challenger .

Mr Browne said he was ‘instinctively uneasy’ about restricting religious freedoms, but he added there may be a case to act to protect girls who were too young to decide for themselves whether they wished to wear the veil or not.’ ‘There is genuine debate about whether girls should feel a compulsion to wear a veil when society deems children to be unable to express personal choices about other areas like buying alcohol, smoking or getting married. ‘We should be very cautious about imposing religious conformity on a society which has always valued freedom of expression.’ Risky?

Friends and family of a Georgia teenager abducted in the night yesterday are scrambling to gather a ransom now being demanded by her kidnappers. The two strangers who wrenched Ayvani Hope Perez from her suburban Atlanta home want $10,000 for the 14-year-old’s safe return. The men are making the rare ransom demand despite taking Perez only after the family had no money or jewelry to give Tuesday. Scroll down for video... 'She's safe!': Home invaders stole Ayvani Hope Perez, 14, away from her family Tuesday. The teen was returned to her family safe and sound Wednesday . A vigil of 150 people gathered late Tuesday evening, but Perez’s aunt Suky Guerrero told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution she was still unsure where the money was going to come from. ‘My brother doesn’t have a clue. He doesn’t have any money like that,’ Geurrero, the sister of the girl’s father, told the Journal-Constitution. A law enforcement source confirmed the ransom demand to the Atlanta paper. Meanwhile, local officials have publicly denied knowledge of a ransom. 'We haven't heard anything about a ransom, I don't know how that got out,' Clayton County police Sergeant Kevin Hughes told Mailonline. Sergeant Hughes said the county is now working in conjunction with state and federal officials. A Georgia Bureau of Investigation spokesperson said the FBI has now taken the lead on the case. A call to FBI's Atlanta division was not immediately returned Wednesday morning. Terrified: The 4-foot-9, Hispanic teen was wrenched from her terrifying mother around 2am Tuesday while she was still wearing her Star Wars pajamas. Police say she is in extreme danger . ‘He was devastated, not knowing what to do,’ Guerrero said of her brother. Alberto Perez, 47, was en route to Atlanta as his daughter’s terrified friends gathered at Dutchtown High School in Hampton, Georgia for a prayer vigil. ‘She's so nice,’ one friend told 11alive.com. ‘I don't know why people would do this to her. I'm praying just to get her home safely.’ Another classmate was struggling to come to grips with the situation. ‘I don't get it,’ said Sydney Chaquir. ‘It's not clicking in my mind why somebody would do this to her. It's like a dream.’ Unsuspecting: Clayton County Police Lt. Marc Richards updates the press at the Georgia subdivision once described as nice and quiet where Ayvani was snatched in the night . Pictured: Police sketched show the two African American men who authorities believe took Ayvani after their demands for money and jewelry went unmet. They also shot the family dog. Now they want a $10,000 ransom . Senseless: Two black males in dark clothing broke into Perez's Ellenwood, Georgia home at 2am Tuesday. When her mother had no valuables, they shot the dog and took Ayvani . Clayton County Georgia police spokesman Phong Nguyen said the invasion appears to be completely random. ‘It didn’t appear that they knew each other,’ he said. ‘They just moved in about a month ago.’ Nguyen said the two African American males smashed through a back door of the home and Maria Perez quickly tried to hide her children, but the men found Ayvani. The men wanted money and jewelry, but Maria had none to give, so they took the girl instead. Relief: Around 150 of Ayvani's classmates and former classmates gathered at a Hampton, Georgia high school for a Tuesday night prayer vigil. Their prayers were answered Wednesday . Spreading the word: Many friends and even concerned strangers quickly took to social media to spread word of Ayvani's kidnapping and to gather information . Alert: Clayton County police monitor Brookgate Drive, a suburban street full of families where Ayvani had lived for just one month before she was snatched . Now authorities are doing what they can to get her back. ‘This is the time for the Clayton community and the community as a whole to come together,’ Clayton County Police Chief Gregory Porter said. ‘We’re trying to make sure that we bring her some safely.’ The abductors escaped with Perez in a grey Dodge or Chevrolet sedan and were described as wearing dark clothing. Perez is believed to be in extreme danger and a Levi's Call—Georgia's version of the Amber alert—was activated. Man hunt: A Clayton County Police officer questions a driver in the Brookgate subdivision. State, federal, and local officials have all joined the frantic search for Ayvani, which ended Wednesday with her joyous reunion with family .

Food prices are set to soar by nearly 20 per cent in the next five years as the global food shortage worsens, a report has warned. The staggering 17.8 per cent hike will see an average family's household food bill shoot up by £850 a year while the nation's annual food bill will rise by £19.6billion. The inflation-busting increase will see the price of a loaf of sliced bread rise by 25p while a pint of milk would rise by nine pence. Rising prices: The price of food will rise by 17.8% by 2018 - increasing the cost of a sliced loaf of bread by 25p, a new report claims . The report by retail consultancy Conlumino suggests that the growing global demand for meat and grain as well as the 'erratic' weather is to blame. Conlumino analyst Neil Saunders told the Daily Telegraph: 'The only way we are going to produce more is by bringing more land into play. 'Out of all sectors on the high street, food will see the highest inflation between now and 2018.' It comes after research by the Institute of Grocery Distribution showed many people in Britain are already struggling to survive. The cost of a shopping basket of food essentials, everything from tea bags to a pint of milk, has already risen by 60 per cent since 2007. As a result, a family spending £500 a month on food six years ago could now have to find as much as £800 – an extra £3,600 a year. Staples such as a loaf of bread are up by a staggering 67 per cent, while butter is up 157 per cent, pasta  by 171 per cent, and the cost of beef mince has doubled. By contrast, the typical median salary for Britons in full-time work has risen by a much lower 10 per cent since 2007 to £26,462.

A Florida woman known as 'hiccup girl' has been deemed psychologically fit to stand trial for the 2010 murder of a man she met online. Judge Nancy Moate Ley ordered an evaluation of Jennifer Mee on Wednesday morning, as prosecutors and defense attorneys were due to give their opening statements, after learning the 22-year-old was schizophrenic. It was already known Mee suffered from Tourette syndrome, and the uncontrollable hiccuping that brought her fame in 2007 was a symptom of this disorder, however even her attorney only recently discovered the woman also suffered from schizophrenia. Scroll down for videos . Trial: Defendant Jennifer Mee, pictured on Wednesday, reacts to testimony during her murder trial after she was deemed fit to stand . Hiccups: Mee, 22, found fame in 2007 as a teen because of her uncontrollable hiccupping . After the brief evaluation, during which she was deemed competent to stand trial, the proceedings began and prosecutors began laying the groundwork for their case. Assistant State Attorney Christopher LaBruzzo admitted Mee wasn't the one who aimed the gun at Shannon Griffin in his opening address, but he said she was still guilty of first-degree murder because 'she set everything up.' He told the jury the then-19-year-old used a social networking site through a cell phone to contact Griffin and offer to sell him marijuana but it was all a con. 'There was, in fact, no marijuana to be sold. In fact, instead of marijuana they had a loaded .38-special handgun with six shots in it,' LaBruzzo said, according to the Tampa Bay Times. He explained that the two men she lived with robbed the 22-year-old Griffin before they struggled over the gun and 'shot him... four times in the chest and they left him for death in a dark alleyway.' The victim's wallet, keys were later found at Mee's apartment and her fingerprints were discovered on Griffin's driver's license, LaBruzzo said. Mee's lawyer, John Trevena, used his opening statements to claim that Mee wasn't even at the home when Griffin was fatally shot. Crime scene: Kurt Bradshaw, St. Petersburg Police officer, shows the jury a photograph of the crime scene during Jennifer Mee trial on Wednesday, September 18, 2013 . 'She is not at that scene but they want you to convict her of murder in the first-degree based on their theory that Ms Mee was setting up a marijuana deal that somehow went bad,' he told the jurors. Trevena suggested Mee couldn't have been behind the disturbing plot because she didn't even own a cell phone, and therefore couldn't have planned the drug deal with the young man. Also on Wednesday, Kurt Bradshaw, an officer with the St. Petersburg Police Department, showed the jury a photograph of the crime scene. A handgun and a pair of shoes can be seen on a sidewalk near a white fence. The jury was selected on Tuesday in the murder trial of the woman who appeared on several national television programs as a teen because of her out-of-control hiccuping. Judge Nancy Moate Ley told potential jurors in a Pinellas County courtroom that the trial would probably wrap up by the end of the week. Miss Mee is one of three people accused in the 2010 killing of Walmart employee Shannon Griffin Jr during a burglary gone awry in St. Petersburg. Back in court: Jennifer Mee holds her head after she looked at family members, as jury selection begins her murder trial Tuesday . Defense: Mee talks with her attorney Bryant Camareno at the Pinellas County Justice Center in Clearwater, Fla. Bleak prospects: Mee, 22, faces a life in prison if convicted in the 2010 murder of a Walmart employee . Relapse: Mee's lawyer said she has experienced periodic bouts of hiccups while in jail, and she is being treated with a drug called thorazine . Judge Moate Ley said in court Tuesday . that the prosecution and defense will have to choose a dozen jurors from . a pool of about 70, The Tampa Tribune reported. Two prospective members of the panel were excused . after explaining that they would not be able to be impartial. Two . other would-be jurors were also dismissed: one of them because Judge . Moate Ley had presided over her husband's divorce case, and the other . because she had to take care of her ailing mother. The . case has attracted widespread attention because Mee had gained . notoriety in 2007 when she had a case of hiccups that wouldn't stop. Videos . of her hiccuping up to 50 times a minute gained her national attention, . as did her attempts to quell the problem. She tried home remedies and . consulted medical specialists, a hypnotist and an acupuncturist, until . the hiccups finally stopped on their own. Just over two weeks ago, Mee's . co-defendant Laron Raiford, 23, was sentenced to life in prison after . being convicted of first-degree murder. Mr Raiford was the first of the three suspects to go to trial. If convicted of murder, Mee could face a life sentence. At . issue is whether Mee was a bystander or the person who planned the . robbery — prosecutors say she played an active role in planning the . robbery, which lead to Griffin's death. Under . Florida law, a person can be convicted of murder if he or she committed . a serious felony crime — such as robbery — and someone was killed as a . result. Trevena, . Mee's attorney, said his client suffered from Tourette's Syndrome, a . neurological disorder that can cause involuntary movements and speech . problems. Charged: Jennifer Mee, 22, is accused of luring Shannon Griffin (right) into a robbery in 2010, which ended in him being shot dead . Co-defendants: Mee's then-boyfriend Lamont Newton, right, is still awaiting trial, while his friend Laron Raiford, left, was sentenced to life in prison August 30 . He said that the hiccups were one symptom of Tourette's and said Tuesday that he will mention that during the trial. 'It . won't be used as a direct cause for what occurred but it might help . explain her errors in judgment and her often thoughtless response to law . enforcement,' said Trevena, who said Mee did not participate in . the robbery. Trevena said Mee has been in jail pending trial since her October 2010 arrest — much of that time in isolation because detention deputies say she is a high profile inmate. Mee has experienced periodic bouts of hiccups while in jail, said Trevena, and she is being treated with a drug called thorazine. 'It controls the hiccups,' he said. During a tearful prison interview on . the Today show in 2011, then-19-year-old Mee blamed her short-lived fame . for taking her down 'the path of the devil' and drawing her into bad . company. In the spotlight: Jennifer Mee first appeared on television as 'hiccup girl' when she was 15 (left), and she was even invited on the Today show (right) When . Mee was 15 years old, she became known as 'hiccup girl' when she began . hiccuping 50 times a minute. Her condition left doctors baffled and . earned her international publicity. Three . years later, she appeared in the news again - this time charged with . first-degree felony murder after police claimed she acted as bait to . lure Shannon Griffin, 22, into a robbery. Mee . is not accused of firing the gun, but under Florida law a defendant can . be charged with murder if they willingly take part in a felony which . then leads to someone's death. She has been held in Pinellas County jail ever since she was charged. Talking from the prison, she told NBC's Amy Robach in 2011 she cannot bear to . think about the possibility she could spend the rest of her life behind . bars. Fifteen minutes of fame: Mee had gained notoriety in 2007 when she had a case of hiccups that wouldn't stop . Downward spiral: Mee is accused of using a social networking site to lure the 22-year-old victim to an empty house where he was robbed and killed . She said: 'I’m scared. I want to go home; I can tell you that. My . sisters are growing up, my mom is missing me' The teenager said at the time she thinks about Mr Griffin's death every day. Prosecutors claim Mee plotted with her boyfriend, . Lamont Newton, and his friend, Laron Raiford, to rob Mr Griffin. Newton is still awaiting trial for first degree murder. She is . accused of using a social networking site to lure the 22-year-old on October 23, 2010, to . a dark alley in St Petersburg, where the two men robbed then shot him, getting away with $50. Initially Mee told police the shooting happened because Raiford found out Mr Griffin had been romantically involved with his girlfriend in the past. But later she changed her story and allegedly confessed she lured Mr Griffin to his death. Defense strategy: Mee's lawyer said his client had suffered from Tourette's syndrome and didn't know what she was doing . Blame game: Mee contented that her short-lived fame led her astray and drew her into bad company . Mee left home at 17, two years after she became known as 'hiccup . girl'. She claims her short-lived celebrity 'went to her head' and made . her go off the rails. Months of incessant hiccups left her temporarily unable to attend school as she disrupted other students. She tried home remedies and consulted medical specialists, a hypnotist, a . chiropractor, and an acupuncturist, until the hiccups finally just . stopped on their own a few weeks later. Her lawyer, Trevena, said: 'If you really believe her story, she’s really not guilty of anything except poor judgement of who she associated with.'","Jennifer Mee, 22, is charged with murder in the 2010 killing of Shannon Griffin .

"By . Daniel Martin . PUBLISHED: . 11:02 EST, 17 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:41 EST, 18 September 2013 . David Cameron was drawn into a row over offensive football chants yesterday as he defended Tottenham Hotspur fans who shout the word ‘Yid’. The Prime Minister revealed that he thought supporters of the North London club should not face prosecution for chanting the terms ‘Yiddos’ and ‘Yid army’ at games because they are jokingly referring to themselves and therefore not ‘motivated by hate’. But he said other people should be discouraged from using the term, because of the offence it could cause. His view directly contradicts the official stance of the Football Association, which has issued a statement warning Spurs fans that using the words could result in a banning order or even lead to criminal charges. His say: Cameron believes fans who used the word should not be prosecuted, unless it is used in hatred . Support: Tottenham fans will face no action for chanting the word 'Yid' last weekend . For . years, Tottenham supporters have been on the receiving end of . anti-Semitic abuse from opposition fans – as the club has long had a . Jewish following. In an . act of defiance, some started using the word ‘Yid’ themselves and chants . of ‘Yids’, ‘Yid army’ and ‘Yiddos’ are regularly heard coming from the . home stands at White Hart Lane. Mr Cameron told The Jewish Chronicle that it was wrong for people to use the word in a derogatory sense. Yid is probably short for Yiddish, the German-influenced language spoken since medieval times by people from the Jewish diaspora in central and eastern Europe. The word derives from German word Jude, meaning Jew, which is pronounced with an initial Y sound. It was first recorded in English in 1874, when it was included in a dictionary of London slang. Since the Second World War the word has been used by Jewish authors, often to portray antisemitic speech. Some Jewish groups say the term is offensive all of the time. But . he added: ‘There’s a difference between Spurs fans self-describing . themselves as Yids and someone calling someone a Yid as an insult. ‘You have to be motivated by hate. Hate speech should be prosecuted – but only when it’s motivated by hate.’ However . the Football Association said the word was ‘derogatory and offensive’ and urged fans to refrain from using it on the terraces. In . a statement last week the FA announced: ‘The use of the term “Yid” is . likely to be considered offensive by the reasonable observer – and it . considers the term to be inappropriate in a football setting. ‘The FA would encourage fans to avoid using it in any situation.’ The . statement finishes with a warning, which says: ‘Use of the term in a . public setting could amount to a criminal offence, and leave those fans . liable to prosecution and potentially a lengthy football banning order.’ The club has responded . to the FA by announcing that they plan to send a questionnaire to all . season ticket holders asking if they think the practice should stop. Debut: Fans chanted 'Yiddo' at Christian Eriksen (left), in action against Bradley Johnson . But . fans reacted defiantly to the statement, chanting ‘Yid army’ and ‘we’ll . sing what we want’ throughout their 2-0 win over Norwich. And Ellie . Kershaw, a board member for Tottenham Hotspur Supporters’ Trust, . insisted that Spurs fans have reclaimed the word, making it no longer . offensive. Last night a . Number 10 spokesman said: ‘We would discourage anyone from using the . term “Yid” given the historical associations of the term and the offence . that it could cause. ‘The . PM was asked about criminal prosecution and specifically whether people . who refer to themselves in this way should be prosecuted. Self-referring is clearly different to people using it as a term of . abuse motivated by hatred.’ However . the Board of Deputies of British Jews said it backs the Football . Association’s stance on the use of the word ‘Yid’ – as many see any use . of the word as an anti-Semitic form of abuse. And . Jewish Chelsea fan Danny Finkelstein, a former adviser to Mr Cameron, . said he disagreed with the Prime Minister’s stance. He told BBC Radio . 4’s PM programme: ‘This is an insulting word and when I take my children . to a game with Spurs it is so disturbing to have Chelsea fans react to . this chant with racist insults. ‘I . don’t think Spurs Jews have control of the term in the way they think . they do. In addition it makes me very uncomfortable to see so many . non-Jews use this phrase.’ Watch your language: Tottenham fans have been given a strong caution by the FA not to chant the word Yid . Hitting back: Comedian David Baddiel, pictured with his wife Morwenna Banks, said only a small minority of Tottenham fans are Jewish . Jewish comedian David Baddiel has spoken out against the chants, insisting that using the word ‘Yid’ is unacceptable – and that only a minority of Spurs fans are actually Jewish. Mr Baddiel said Tottenham fans’ argument that they are ‘reclaiming’ the term is illogical as the club’s Jewish association has long been considered outdated. He claimed that fewer than five per cent of those in the ground at home games are now Jewish. ‘There are only 250,000 Jews in Britain as a whole and I’d say that about three or four per cent of Tottenham’s crowd is Jewish,’ he said. ‘That means that well over 90 per cent of those chanting “Yid Army” are not actually Jewish  – and that is just one of several reasons why it cannot be right.’ He added: ‘At Tottenham, the club’s “Jewishness” is just a historical association with the area. ‘It’s doubtful that there are more than five per cent actual Jews in the ground at home games. ‘So the argument “But it is just like Snoop Doggy Dogg using the N-word” does not apply to most of the Spurs fans.’ Mr Baddiel, a Chelsea supporter, who made a film about the issue last year for campaign group Kick Racism Out Of Football, said Spurs fans’ use of the term encouraged other teams’ supporters to use it in a more derogatory sense. ‘It’s a call and response dynamic, like many at football matches,’ he wrote on the Guardian website. ‘So the more Spurs do it, the more it comes back, with menaces.

Kym McKenzie, 52, had hoped to be able to pay for her son Ramoan, 15, to go to university with takings from the garden cafe opened at her home in Southampton, Hampshire. She had hoped to capitalise on trade from the nearby Millbrook Trading Estate and claims that she only began work in April last year when she was told by councillors that she didn't need planning permission. At a loss: Kym McKenzie, 52, spent more than £40,000 converting her home into a garden cafe, but could now lose her property after being denied planning permission . High hopes: Ms McKenzie, pictured inside the cafe, had hoped to put her son Ramoan, also pictured, through university with proceeds from the cafe . But she faces financial ruin after her application was refused due to a lack of safe pedestrian access. Ms McKenzie is now unable to keep with repayments on her business loan. She had proposed that access would be via a gate in the garden fence, which would open on to a privately owned grass verge. But the council said it was not clear if delivery vehicles would be able to access the cafe without having a harmful impact on her neighbours.

During the early Eighties, the legendary jazz musician Dizzy Gillespie was introduced to the son of a wealthy London lawyer called Walter Houser, who co-owned Ronnie Scott’s club in Soho. ‘What do you want to be when you grow up?’ he asked Houser’s child. The boy, who was not yet a teenager, did not have to pause long to dream up his answer. ‘A bank robber,’ he replied. That child’s name was Sam Houser. Fast-forward 30 years and — while he hasn’t quite realised that lofty ambition — the once-shy youth has perhaps managed to achieve what he regards as the next best thing. Driving force: Grand Theft Auto's creators Sam (left) and Dan Houser have each built personal fortunes estimated at £50million from the ultra-violent series . Sam, with his younger brother and business partner Dan, are responsible for turning a generation of sore-thumbed couch potatoes into bank robbers — at least on screen — thanks to the phenomenally successful video game franchise, Grand Theft Auto. The duo, who live in New York, have each built personal fortunes estimated at  £50 million from the ultra-violent series, in which players assume the identity of ruthless underworld criminals. Despite (or perhaps because of) its controversial depiction of sex, violence, rape, car-jacking, drug dealing, torture and murder, GTA — as it is known to aficionados — has shifted more than 135 million units since its 1997 debut. That has translated into billions in profits for their company, Rockstar Games, which was founded in the late 1990s and now boasts several hundred (mostly male) employees, in offices around the world. Violent: A man prowls the streets with a gun in Grand Theft Auto V, which was released on Tuesday at midnight . The brothers dress like rap artists, in chunky jewellery and baggy sportswear, and are obsessed with the modish image of the firm which they claim to have modelled on American hip-hop record label Def Jam. Sam, a dishevelled-looking, bearded 41-year-old, is the ‘ideas man’ behind GTA and other games. The Wall Street Journal once dubbed him ‘a secretive, demanding workaholic [with] a temperament and a budget befitting a Hollywood mogul’. Dan, who is balding and two years younger, writes the ‘scripts’ for Rockstar. He lives in an 11-bedroom mansion in Brooklyn famed as the home where Truman Capote wrote his 1958 novella Breakfast At Tiffany’s. Together, the brothers preside over a highly colourful working environment. Employees are encouraged to wear . T-shirts and bomber jackets embossed with Rockstar’s logo, and attend . raucous company parties which have been jollified (on at least one . occasion) by strippers wearing Catholic school uniforms. Chase: The controversial video game involves attacking innocent people for fun . In the book Jacked, a history of Rockstar, author David Kushner details the firm’s louche after-hours culture in eye-popping detail, telling, for example, how employees are encouraged to take part in ‘cheese ball eating’ contests. The night-time events, in which the Houser brothers put up £2,000 in prize money, require entrants to eat fist-sized balls of deep-fried cheese while wearing Lance Armstrong-themed yellow headbands carrying the logo ‘eat strong’ (a play on the cyclist’s former charity Livestrong). Buckets are provided for them to vomit into, along with bottles of tequila to help clear palates. The ‘company record’ is believed to be held by a programmer who scoffed 24 cheese balls at one sitting. These lively — if somewhat juvenile — soirees are said to contribute to the atmosphere of extreme creativity at Rockstar, which prides itself on its ability, as executives like to say, to ‘think outside the box’. Among the many ‘eureka’ moments which led to GTA’s success was an innovation (introduced for the third instalment of the game, released in 2001) allowing players to increase their character’s ‘health’ by having sex with a prostitute. Grand Theft Auto V: The latest game went on sale on Tuesday at midnight . Popular: Fans queue at Game's flagship store in Westfield Stratford City in London for a copy of Grand Theft Auto V . They could then advance in the game by beating or murdering the prostitute and stealing her money. In the parallel universe of video game culture, that apparently counts as an epoch-defining innovation. In addition to their reputation for inventiveness, the Housers are also famed for their gruelling work ethic and commitment to perfectionism. Tales of the demands they place on staff, most of whom work 70-hour weeks, abound. A few years ago, for example, Gillian Telling, a former assistant to Dan Houser, alleged to the Wall Street Journal that he once called her a ‘whore’ and a ‘c***’ when she brought him the wrong kind of bagel for breakfast. In another controversial incident, the actor Burt Reynolds — one of many Hollywood stars who have done voiceover work for Rockstar — threatened to punch Dan after being asked to re-record a line for what he was told would be a forthcoming ‘hit game’. ‘There’s going to be two hits here,’ Reynolds said. ‘Me hitting you, and you hitting the floor.’ One company staffer claimed that Sam Houser was famous for throwing — and breaking — office telephones, and that he was ‘prone to screaming, insisting on marathon work hours and rarely dispensing praise’. Worldwide popularity: Rockstar released Grand Theft Auto V worldwide on Tuesday. This billboard is on the side of the Figueroa Hotel in Los Angeles . One industry analyst has publicly compared the brothers to ‘the kids on the island in Lord Of The Flies’. In 2007, two Rockstar employees committed suicide — though it’s not thought their deaths were related to the company in any way. Shortly afterwards, the Housers attempted to improve the atmosphere in the workplace by hiring a spiritual healer to perform an exorcism on their office. ‘Wearing a long, flowing garment, with an assistant in tow, the woman strode through the office swinging crystals from a string as she moved from desk to desk,’ the Wall Street Journal later revealed. Surprisingly, given their track records, the Houser brothers hail from the most blue-chip of backgrounds. Their mother was Geraldine Moffat, the upper-crust British actress who played Glenda in the 1971 film Get Carter, a role that required her to cavort naked in bed with Michael Caine. The brothers were educated at top public school St Paul’s, in West London, where fees are £30,000 a year. They would be collected at the school gates in their father’s Rolls-Royce. Sam was a classmate of the Chancellor George Osborne. Brutal: A torture victim has his teeth pulled out by pliers in a scene from the newly released Grand Theft Auto V . Peers say he wore Doc Marten boots with his school uniform, was obsessed with gangster movies and hip-hop and that his A-level results were underwhelming. Dan, who was more academic, went on to read geography at Oxford. After leaving school, Sam was hired by record label BMG, where he worked on the launch of the Spice Girls with pop Svengali Simon Fuller and directed the video for Take That’s 1992 debut, Take That And Party. His big break came three years later when he was working in the firm’s interactive division. A Scottish company called DMA pitched a potential game called Race And Chase in which players could be cops or robbers. He tinkered with the format, forcing gamers to play gangsters, rather than policemen, and re-named it Grand Theft Auto. The game launched in 1997. Shortly afterwards, BMG sold off its gaming division and Houser  co-founded Rockstar, bringing his brother on board and taking control of one of the most lucrative franchises in gaming history. Disturbing: The same victim receives a series of electric shocks in the game, which has drawn criticism for its violence . In the early days, GTA’s success was built on its notoriety. Sam hired publicist Max Clifford to drum up controversy over the game and boasted of how gamers could ‘run bagfuls of [the drug] speed to a Member of Parliament’s hooker’. Yet after a series of high-profile scandals in the U.S., where the Columbine High School shootings and several other mass murders were blamed on violent video games, the brothers found themselves under heavy fire. Their nadir came in 2005, when they were denounced by Senator Hillary Clinton and called before the U.S. Federal Trade Commission when a secret, hardcore pornographic scene was discovered in the 2004 game GTA: San Andreas. The Commission’s lawsuit, along with a string of other cases brought by regulators and gamers, cost hundreds of thousands of pounds. Since then, the brothers have attempted to withdraw from the public eye, giving just a handful of interviews in which they appear to be attempting to re-style themselves as right-thinking businessmen. ‘I’m the most conservative guy you’ll ever meet,’ Sam — who is married with two children — told one reporter. ‘I have a panic attack if I even get a parking ticket.’ In the immoral world of GTA, on which the duo’s empire is built, that sort of attitude would surely mean instant Game Over.","Sam and Dan Houser founded Rockstar Games and wrote Grand Theft Auto .

A Seattle-area truck painter who was unmasked as the Green River serial killer has claimed he murdered up to 80 women over two decades - nearly double the number he was convicted of killing. Gary Ridgway is currently serving 49 consecutive life sentences in a Washington state prison. But in a series of interviews conducted over the past five months, he is now claiming there are significantly more victims and he says he is coming clean to help bring closure to their families. Scroll down for video . Locked up: Gary Ridgway, pictured, is currently serving 49 consecutive life sentences in a Washington state prison but says the there are more victims . 'The total number [of victims] is 75 to 80,' Ridgway told KOMO reporter Charlie Harger. Ridgway told police of his crimes following his 2001 arrest and subsequent confession. He admitted that he picked up prostitutes and teenage runaways throughout the 1980s and 1990s in Washington's King County, strangled them during sex and dumped their bodies in wastelands near King County's 65-mile long Green River. The married man had been a suspect in the killings for years, but it wasn't until 2001 that he was arrested, because of advances in DNA testing. Neighbors who described Ridway and his wife as kind and helpful neighbors were shocked. Victims: Ridgway pleaded guilty to 48 murders in 2003 and another in 2011 . More: He said he picked up scores of prostitutes, teen runaways and drug addicts . Shocking: He told police he strangled the girls during sex and then dumped their bodies along the banks of the Green River . Ridgway confessed to 48 murders in 2003, avoiding the death penalty. In 2011 another body was discovered, and he received an additional life sentence. But he now claims there were more and he wants to set the record straight. However, Harger said he remains skeptical about Ridgway's motive. He said the serial killer has a tendency to lie and may just be attempting to 'up his count' for notoriety. 'I think he wants to show the world that, ""Here I am, Gary Ridgway, the truck painter from Kenworth, the guy who everybody thought was slow since elementary school, somebody who couldn't hold a candle to Ted Bundy. But, here I am, and I'm the best at something,""' Harger said. Lies: The serial killer has a tendency to lie and may just be attempting to 'up his count' for notoriety it is believed . Perfect husband: Ridgway's wife claimed she thought she had the perfect husband . But regardless, Harger said his claims should still be investigated. 'Maybe if we listen to the clues and cut through his lies, we will find a nugget of truth, the clue investigators have waited for,' he said. 'It's a chance we have to take.' For years, Ridgway has been speaking with Air Force criminal investigator Rob Fitzgerald about his crimes. The two men speak multiple times per week, according to KOMO, which reported that Ridgway even provides Fitzgerald with photos of supposed 'dump sites' that he says should be searched. Determined to find unidentified victims, Fitzgerald has spent his weekends for the past five years turning up the banks of the Green River. 'They deserve this,' Fitzgerald told the station. 'People need to know there's at least some hope their daughters will be found.'","In a series of interviews, Gary Ridgway claims there are significantly more victims and he says he is coming clean to bring closure to their families .

Petrol retailers have been urged to cut prices at the pumps immediately after a fall in wholesale costs of up to 6p a litre . Petrol retailers have been urged to cut prices at the pumps immediately after a fall in wholesale costs of up to 6p a litre. The RAC said the price suppliers pay for fuel had dropped since the end of August as a result of a strong pound and positive developments in Syria. Filling stations and supermarkets should ‘play fair’ and share the price drop with Britain’s 35million drivers, the motoring organisation said. It has calculated retailers could reduce the price of unleaded petrol by 6p and diesel by 2p a litre. Unleaded costs an average of 138.01p a litre and diesel 142.75p after a slight increase, according to figures from the industry analysts Experian Catalist. Asda has already reacted to the drop in wholesale costs by cutting the price of unleaded by 2p to 133.9p and diesel by a penny to 138.9p a litre. The RAC said retailers had scope to go further. Oil prices have fallen since Syria agreed to sign an international treaty banning chemical weapons. The pound has also reached a seven-month high against the US dollar, the currency in which oil is traded on international markets. The RAC said that as a result of these developments it was ‘calling on fuel retailers to pass on the reductions to cash-strapped motorists immediately’. Its rival the AA has said a key issue affecting motorists at the pumps is the disparity in petrol prices between areas. A convoy of U.N. vehicles drive through one of the sites of an alleged chemical weapons attack in eastern Ghouta in Damascus suburbs . The association’s president, Edmund King, said: ‘Last weekend, supermarket petrol in some towns was 5p a litre more expensive than supermarket petrol in another town just down the road. ‘The pump price postcode lottery is a persistent menace.’","RAC said price suppliers pay for fuel had dropped since the end of August .

Former home secretary Jacqui Smith has said she worries Labour's policy review resembles a pregnant panda - a long time in the making but with no-one sure if there is anything in there. It was a reference to giant panda Tian Tian, who is thought could give birth at Edinburgh Zoo soon but keepers are not certain she is even expecting. Mr Miliband’s infamous ‘black sheet’ policy review was ordered in September 2010, but three years later there has been little detail confirmed.

However Miss Smith, who lost her seat at the last election, said it was time for Mr Miliband to start putting ‘flesh on the bones’. She said eye-catching policies need to emerge at next week's Labour Party conference as she analysed how the gathering will help the opposition win the 2015 general election. Writing for New Labour pressure group Progress, Ms Smith said: ‘August is never going to be the time to outline major future policy initiatives - that has to be at conference. ‘I sometimes worry that our policy review resembles a pregnant panda - it's been a very long time in the making and no one's quite sure if there's anything in there anyway. ‘At this conference, some eye-catching policies need to break out of the conference centre and resonate more widely. ‘Ed Miliband has the tough job of following last year's brilliant speech with the next instalment fleshing out his character and beliefs and telling people about the country he wants to lead and how Labour can deliver it. ‘Couple that with some lively media performances from the excellent shadow cabinet in support, some strong policy announcements to exemplify the overall direction and resisting the temptation to air any internal angst in public - and those of us who aren't making the trip to Brighton might just sit up and take note.’ Pressure: Ed Miliband is expected to start outlining key Labour policies at the party conference in Brighton next week .

Accused: Marilyn Edge, 42, allegedly killed her two children after losing custody of them . A mother has been accused of fatally poisoning her 13-year-old autistic son and nine-year-old daughter in a hotel room after a judge awarded custody of the children to their father. Marilyn Edge, 42, was arrested in Costa Mesa, California on Saturday after she apparently tried to take her own life by crashing her car. She told responding police officers they could find the bodies of her children, Jaelen and Faith, in a room at the Hampton Inn in Santa Ana. Edge, from Scottsdale, Arizona, has now been charged with two counts of murder with special circumstances and is scheduled to be arraigned on Tuesday. If convicted, she could be eligible for the death penalty. Their deaths came after Edge lost custody of her children amid a years-long contentious divorce with her ex-husband. A Georgia judge awarded her former husband, Mark Edge, custody of the children on Wednesday. She texted Edge on Friday to say she would give him the children on Sunday - but their bodies were found on Saturday. Mr Edge, who lives in Marietta, Georgia, was told about the deaths early on Sunday by Atlanta police and was taken to a hospital for duress. 'He's emotionally, extremely distressed,' his attorney Marian Weeks said. 'He is getting better. His whole focus right now is on the children.' Scroll down for video . In court: Edge, right, is shown on a monitor during a video arraignment with Orange County deputy public defender, Arlene Speiser, on Tuesday in Santa Ana, California . Scene: Investigators photograph Edge's car after she allegedly purposefully crashed it on Saturday . Marilyn Edge crashed her car into an electrical box outside a shopping complex in Costa Mesa on Saturday. She refused to get out and tried to choke herself with an electrical cord as rescuers attempted to free her, Santa Ana police Cpl. Anthony Bertagna said. Police also found propane in the car. Edge then told investigators they could find her children's bodies at the hotel, police said. The couple divorced in December 2007 after less than 10 years of marriage. Marilyn Edge had claimed her former husband, who worked as a contractor, failed to make child support payments. She had also claimed that children of her ex-husband's friend were sexually abusing her son and daughter, but the allegations were never proven, Weeks said. Marilyn Edge was given full custody of . her children in October 2009, but this was later set aside when Mark . Edge said he had been working overseas so was unaware of the court date. The Georgia Supreme Court later found there wasn't enough evidence to . set aside the ruling, AP reported. Scene of the crime: The two children were found dead in a room at this Hampton Inn in Santa Ana, CA . Shocking: One hotel guest called the killings 'horrendous' and 'a heartbreaker' But in September a judge reduced child support payments and ordered joint custody of the children. Before that point, Edge hadn't seen his children in more than 18 months because his ex-wife refused to let him visit, the lawyer said. The ex-wife then moved to Arizona, claiming she was taking a job transfer, and Mr Edge only spoke to his children on video phone calls, his lawyer said. At a hearing on Wednesday, a judge found that Marilyn Edge was alienating her children from her ex-husband and said he should be given full custody, Weeks said. The judge gave her until noon Sunday to turn over the children. On Friday, Mark Edge received a text from his ex-wife saying: 'I will see you on Sunday and I have their school records'. Awful: The woman told cops where her children were after multiple failed suicide attempts, according to Santa Ana Police spokesperson Anthony Bertagna . Lawyer Mary Ann Korre said she had . only represented Marilyn Edge at the most recent child custody hearing . and had only known her client a few weeks. She wasn't aware of any reason why her client wouldn't want her ex-husband to have contact with the children. Marilyn Edge was calm at the last hearing and there was nothing to indicate she might harm the kids, Korre said. 'I received the news yesterday and I was just very shocked,' she said.

Battle: The trial over the fortune of Huguette Clark, pictured, could now go ahead on Thursday . A trial to decide who will inherit the . $300 million estate of reclusive copper mining heiress Huguette Clark . has been put on hold for two days in a last-ditch effort to reach a . settlement. Attorneys said that jury selection - which was supposed . to begin on Tuesday - has now been delayed until Thursday to allow more . time for negotiations. The office of the New York attorney general, . Eric Schneiderman, is trying to broker a settlement, attorneys told NBC . News. His office's Charities Bureau has made previous attempts, but . Clark's relatives, who were left with nothing in the will, have . not been able to reach an agreement with the beneficiaries. The case, which involves more than 60 lawyers, concerns the last will of Clark, who owned lavish properties from New York's Fifth Avenue to the California coast but opted to spend her last 20 years in a Manhattan hospital. She died in 2011, at age 104. The dispute pits nearly two dozen of Clark's distant relatives against a goddaughter, the hospital, a nurse, doctors, a lawyer, an accountant, and other professionals and aides who benefited from her April 2005 will, which left nothing to her family. Gifts to Clark's chief nurse included . multiple Manhattan apartments and a $1.2 million Stradivarius violin. Her primary doctor received cash Christmas presents totaling $500,000, . among other gifts. Estate: 19 relatives are now fighting for a share of the $300 million estate. Pictured, inside her Manhattan home . Deserted: Le Beau Chateau was bought by Clark and remained empty for more than 60 years . The hospital got hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash and a $3.5 million painting by French pre-Impressionist Edouard Manet. 'The persons and institution named herein as beneficiaries of my estate are the true objects of my bounty,' the will said, noting that the childless, briefly married Clark had had only 'minimal contacts' with her relatives over the years. But it was signed just six weeks after another version of her will, which left almost all her money to the family members. They're descendants of her half-siblings. The relatives say a coterie of hospital executives, medical professionals and Clark's lawyer and accountant took advantage of their access to the secluded, aged heiress to manipulate their way into her millions of dollars. Gracious: Huguette was shy, but not sad. Her friends and the few relatives who knew her describe her as cheerful, gracious, stubborn, and devoted to her art. She poses at about age 37 . The beneficiaries say Clark was simply a generous woman who wanted to help those who helped her. Clark's father, U.S. Sen. William A. Clark, was one of the richest Americans of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He served as a senator from Montana, where he initially made his fortune from copper mines. His business empire later grew to include building a Western rail line and establishing a Nevada railroad town called Las Vegas. The surrounding Clark County is named for him. The trial will decide only whether Huguette Clark's April 2005 will is valid. But testimony might also peer into pricey presents her caregivers and advisers received while she was alive. 'There may be some connection between gift-giving and undue influence in the will,' Manhattan Surrogate's Court Judge Nora Anderson said at a pretrial hearing Friday. Family wealth: Clark, a copper, timber and railroad heiress, hugs her father on a vacation in Connecticut in 1912 . Ahead of the trial, a new biography about Clark was released and offered tantalizing . details about the French-born heiress who was fixated on . life-like dolls and building miniature castles - often splashing out . thousands of dollars to make them.

Fortune by Bill Dedman and one of Clark's relatives Paul Clark Newell . Jr., lifts the lid on the fascinating family known for staying out of . the limelight.

The mother of a teenage girl who died in a road accident in South Africa the day before she was due to get her GCSE results has paid tribute to her 'happy and beautiful' daughter. Skye Wilsnagh, 17, from Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, was visiting her grandmother with her twin sister Courtney at the time of the accident last month. The teenager's family has held memorial services in both South Africa and the UK after she died on August 21, the day before she was due to receive her GCSE results. 'Happy and beautiful': Tributes have been paid to Skye Wilsnagh who died in a road accident in South Africa the day before her GCSE results . Her mother Miranda told MailOnline: 'Skye was a twin so her sister is obviously as heart-broken as I am, if not more so. 'None of us can actually understand the bond between twins, so with her having lost her sister it has been absolutely horrific and it was just such a pointless accident. 'She was just so healthy, happy and beautiful.' Mrs Wilsnagh and her husband William discovered their daughter had passed all of her GCSEs and was on course to study at Henley College college with her sister Courtney. She had planned to go on to university to become a criminal psychologist. She said: 'Obviously Courtney has now started at college, but it's hard. 'The fact that life's got to carry on without her, it's just so devastating. We will miss her very much.' Tribute: Skye (left, with her twin sister Courtney) was always 'dancing, smiling and singing', her mother has said . Mrs Wilsnagh said her daughter had been on holiday in Spain with her friend the week before she visited her grandmother in South Africa. She said: 'We are very honoured to say we have had a child like Skye in our lives and she will be very sorely missed. 'If you saw Skye walking into a room she would actually be dancing into it, she was always dancing and smiling and joking around.' 'That's what we are going to miss the most about her, just what a happy, cheerful person she was.' Tragedy: Mrs Wilsnagh said her daughter had been on holiday in Spain with her friend the week before she visited her grandmother in South Africa . Mrs Wilsnagh said she had been 'amazed' by the 'love and support' her family had received from friends and neighbours in the UK. She said: 'We have just been absolutely amazed by people's love and generosity. 'On our return from South Africa we came home to a house full of flowers, fruit baskets, fresh bread, milk and food in the fridge; and the neighbours have even taken turns to provide us with home cooked meals every night so I don't have to deal with the grief, as well as give a thought to what's on the dinner table at night. 'We are just absolutely amazed by the love and support we have received by everyone.' Last . Monday a memorial service was held at St Teresa's Catholic Church in . Beaconsfield, which featured a eulogy read by Skye's older brother Kyle, . 21. 'We are very honoured to say we have had a child like Skye in our lives and she will be very sorely missed' - Miranda Wilsnagh . John Fletcher headteacher at The Beaconsfield School, said: 'Skye was an amazing young lady who had immense potential. Since joining the school Skye has been an inspiration to all students she came into contact with. 'Her leadership skills and ability to motivate people was self-evident in her role as a prefect, she gave of her time freely in order to ensure that she could help others to reach their full potential. 'Her determination to succeed was clear for all to see, she had achieved good GCSE results to enable her to study her chosen A levels. Skye will be sadly missed by all who knew her.' The school is planning to remember Skye in a permanent way by creating an award in her name which will be presented annually at the school's awards evening in the summer. Mrs Wilsnagh said: 'Her friends from both countries were devastated after hearing the news that Skye was no longer with us. 'Skye was well-loved and really made a difference to everyone she met.' Mrs Wilsnagh said Skye’s choice to study criminal psychology was fitting for the person she was. She said: 'When we asked her why she wanted to study criminal psychology, she said she wanted to give people a second chance. It was just who she was.' Skye and her sister regularly volunteered at Lory Park Zoo, in South Africa, and at Dipley Mill Gardens, in Hook, every summer. She was also a volunteer at St Teresa's Church where she helped to raise money for Sparkles, a charity supporting children with Down's Syndrome.","Skye Wilsnagh died while visiting her grandmother in South Africa .

A 23 year old 'cold-case' rape has been brought to trial thanks to new technology and the alleged victim's EastEnders habit. The alleged victim, at the time a 20-year-old club cashier, was brutally attacked as she was on her way home from work in May 1990, a court heard. Salvador Orozco, 49, is standing trial accused of dragging the woman into a derelict Gateshead railway yard and raping her. Saving soap: It was this scene from a 1990 episode of EastEnders where Kathy Beale is raped by James Willmott-Brown which made the young woman take notes and ensure she preserved DNA following the attack . Following the supposed assault, the woman ensured she preserved DNA evidence on her body and made detailed notes, inspired by an episode of the BBC soap where character Kathy Beale is raped by bar owner . James Willmott-Brown. ‘Kathy had been raped by Willmott-Brown and I remember watching the story,' she told a jury at Newcastle Crown Court. ‘I knew I had not to have a shower or bath and I knew it was important to remember as much as I could. When I got home I . decided to make notes of everything that happened, step-by-step, so it . would help me remember when I spoke to police.’ Orozco, previously of Bensham, Gateshead, was extradited from Hawaii earlier this year after a specialist team executed a warrant at his US home, a jury was told. Prosecutors claim he approached the woman at Gateshead Metro Station on May 17, 1990, before brutally assaulting her in wasteland off Askew Road, in Gateshead. Attack: The then 20-year-old was on her way home in May 1990 when she claims Orozco dragged her from the Gateshead Metro Station and brutally raped her . Speaking from behind a screen, the alleged victim told the court: ‘I felt an arm around my neck. I thought it was something messing about because you don’t think that something bad is going to happen to you. It was quite strong and I couldn’t get out and that’s when I realised it wasn’t a joke. ‘I was just saying, ‘Please, no. Please, stop it.’ It was terrifying. I was crying and sobbing and struggling and I was really worried that I was going to get hurt. I was paralysed.’ The jury was told that following the assault the woman’s attacker told her: ‘You must hate me, you must feel degraded.’ Following the assault Orozco is said to have covered his victim in her own coat, before threatening her towait ten minutes before contacting the ‘boys in blue’ so he could escape. Gavin Doig, prosecuting, said: ‘The victim was first shocked, then terrified. She began to cry, to panic and to sob. The man told her he was going to make love to her, that she would like it. ‘She was begging him not to hurt her, . not to kill her.’ He added: ‘At one point she looked around and the man . hit her, saying: ‘Don’t look or I’ll slap you.’’ The . woman fled the scene and returned home before her husband discovered . her wrapped in a duvet in the couple’s living room, the court heard. Her . injuries were so severe that she vomited during a police interview and . could not be examined by forensic scientists, it was said. Case revived: Following the cold case review in 2002, alleged attacker Orozco could be extradited from Hawaii and is now facing trial on rape charges at Newcastle Crown Court . Over a decade later, advances in forensic science sparked a cold case review of the rape. In 2002, DNA evidence was checked against the national DNA database where a match was discovered with Orozco’s two children. 'Scientific conclusions found that ‘the prospect of anyone other than the defendant having the DNA found at the time of the crime was one in a billion’, Mr Doig said, adding: ‘In short, it was [Orozco] who left it there.’ Orozco has admitted having sex with the woman but claims he lived a ‘promiscuous lifestyle’ and that the sex was consensual. Mr Doig said: ‘The defence here is that he and victim decided jointly to go have sex having met near to the Gateshead bus station. ‘The defendant says he had a promiscuous lifestyle at the time. As a result he cannot now recall if they were already acquainted or if the victim decided she urgently wanted to have sex with him immediately upon meeting him that night.’ Following the attack the victim helped create a ‘rather accurate’ artist’s impression in a bid to catch her attacker, the court was told. Orozco denies rape, attempted buggery and indecent assault. The trial continues.

"By . James Chapman . PUBLISHED: . 18:10 EST, 17 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:24 EST, 18 September 2013 . Vince Cable yesterday attacked the Tories¿ proposed tax breaks for married couples . Vince Cable yesterday attacked the Tories’ proposed tax breaks for married couples as an ‘insult’. The Business Secretary said the long-promised move by the Conservatives would unfairly penalise widows and those whose spouses had left them. The assault by the senior Lib Dem came after it emerged that party leader Nick Clegg has agreed a deal with David Cameron to ensure it becomes law. Sources say the Deputy Prime Minister will order his MPs to abstain on any vote on the issue and is threatening to sack any ministers who break ranks. It is thought that Mr Clegg has agreed not to oppose the measure in return for a £600million commitment to extend free school meals to children aged between five and seven. But Mr Cable yesterday denounced the proposed flagship Conservative policy, under which one spouse would be allowed to transfer £750 of their tax-free personal allowance to their partner. ‘I’m a great believer in marriage, and I’m in favour of encouraging stable marriage,’ he said. ‘But this is not the way to do it. ‘It’s going to create massive unfairness. Widows will be penalised. People who have been abandoned by their partners will be penalised. ‘People in good, stable marriages are going to be insulted at the idea that a few hundred quid a year is going to keep their marriage together.’ The measure would particularly favour those partnerships where someone stays at home and will also be extended to gay couples in civil partnerships or – once the law changes next year – marriages. The assault by the senior Lib Dem came after it emerged that party leader Nick Clegg has agreed a deal with David Cameron to ensure it becomes law . Labour has already said it will oppose the recognition of marriage in the tax system, opening up a key election dividing line. The proposed policy can now only pass into law if the Lib Dems stick to a previous agreement to abstain in any future Commons vote on the issue. Mr Clegg will today tell the Lib Dem conference in Glasgow that the party had committed not to vote against the measure as part of a Coalition deal. ‘The Conservatives are very attached to the idea of a so-called married tax break, and they put it in the coalition agreement and we committed not to vote against it,’ he will say. ‘But I don’t support it because I don’t understand what is remotely fair about telling an unmarried taxpayer, “You are going to have to pay higher taxes to help your neighbour just because they got married to get lower taxes”. Mr Clegg will today tell the Lib Dem conference in Glasgow that the party had committed not to vote against the measure as part of a Coalition deal . The Conservatives want to single out certain families, we want to help all families with young children.’ A source close to the Deputy Prime Minister insisted that all Lib Dem MPs would be expected to abstain on the issue. ‘They want to spend whatever it is on the marriage tax allowance, we want to spend it on free school meals for all young children,’ the source said. ‘It’s a straight up and down deal. We will be sticking to the coalition agreement and abstaining when marriage tax comes forward and we will expect our MPs to do that.’ Ministers or MPs who refuse to comply and vote against the measure can expect to be dismissed, the source indicated. Mr Cable is planning to abstain, but his attack on the idea of a transferable tax allowance may encourage other potential rebels. The measure has been brought forward on the agenda and Chancellor George Osborne now plans to include it in his Autumn statement. He has also promised childcare tax breaks after 2015 to help working women, leading to calls to support for stay-at-home mothers with a transferable tax allowance. The Coalition’s previous focus was to raise the personal income tax allowance threshold to £10,000. But a report unveiled at the Lib Dem conference by Christian charity CARE last night called it a ‘terribly inefficient’ way of helping poorer families as it ‘ignores Britain’s lack of regard for family responsibility’. It called for a generous transferable allowance for married couples.","Assault comes after it emerged Nick Clegg has agreed a deal with David Cameron to ensure it becomes law .

A relaxation of planning rules could see town centre shops converted into homes, as ministers accept that the thriving high streets of the past are unlikely to return. Rather than seeking to revive every street of boarded-up shops, planning minister Nick Boles suggested that councils should concentrate retail outlets in 'prime' locations and allow other areas to become residential. Following a report by retail guru Mary Portas, who was hired by David Cameron to find a way of reviving dying town centres, some £1.2million of taxpayer money was shared out between 12 towns for initiatives to inject new life into their traditional shopping high streets. Empty shop on high streets, such as here in Margate, one of Mary Portas's 12 pilot towns, could be converted into affordable homes (file photo) Retail consultant Mary Portas became a Government advisor on how to rescue the High Street, but many of her key recommendations have been ignored . But her key recommendations, which included cutting business rates and putting a brake on new shopping centres, have both been rejected. Mr Boles today said that planners most respond 'creatively' to shifts in the way today's consumers shop. Allowing redundant shops to be converted into homes could ease pressure on greenfield sites for residential developments. The planning minister said: 'People' s shopping habits are changing very fast as a result of the rise in internet shopping and changes in lifestyles and working patterns . 'We need to think creatively about how to help town centres thrive in this new era. 'We want to encourage local councils to concentrate retail activity into the prime shopping streets in the heart of their town centres and adopt a more relaxed approach to under-used retail frontages.' Planning Minister Nick Boles said councils need to think 'creatively' about how to revive flagging High Streets . Ms Portas expressed concern that councils would choose the 'easy option' of turning units into housing and said that losing the high street would be 'one of the greatest social crimes in our country.' Mr Boles also indicated that councils are to be encouraged to allow farmers to convert old agricultural buildings into homes. 'We want to make the best use of existing buildings in the countryside to meet the desperate need for affordable housing in rural communities,' he said. 'The more redundant barns that can be converted into homes for young families, the more we can protect green fields from development.' Earlier this week, a Chocalatier forced by soaring costs to shut his flagship shop warned that the British high street is almost dead. Simon Dunn, whose store was in Chancellor George Osborne’s constituency, says small businesses are being forced out as their profits are squeezed. He was left with £100 for himself ‘in . a good week’ after paying rent, business rates and wages, leading him . to warn: ‘Before long all that will be left on the British high street . is Tesco, Costa and charity shops – it’s just impossible for people like . me to keep our heads above the water.’ ‘I’m afraid independent traders on the high street just don’t have a chance these days in this tough current economic climate. ‘My . shop was in George Osborne’s constituency [Tatton]. He ought to know . the importance of independent businesses and try to do something to help . us. It’s the rising cost of everything that is affecting business . owners like me. ‘The sad part of it is that we’re not . the only business that’s having to do this. It’s a national problem . that is affecting every high street. 'On . a good week we were left with £100-a-week profit and it was just not . worth it. There seems to be no incentive to operate as an independent on . the high street these days. Chocolatier Simon Dunn warned that the High Street is nearly dead following the closure of his flagship shop in Wilmslow, Cheshire . ‘I have to turn over a certain amount just to keep moving, but if I go over that amount suddenly I find myself in a position where I can be taxed more. It’s as though business owners are punished for being successful.’ He will now concentrate on the business’s online operation. Ms Portas condemned the Government over a decision to allow Tesco to build a vast new supermarket on the seafront at Margate, one of her pilot towns, in June and accused the Government of 'paying lip service' to the idea of regenerating high streets. She has become an outspoken champion of . small retailers and fought to try and revive town centres ravaged by the . impact of large supermarkets. However, she has effectively been . overruled by the equally combative Eric Pickles, the Secretary for . communities and local government, who has approved the Margate scheme. The . new Tesco, which had been fought by local residents and traders, will . be a massive 82,000 square feet and sit on what is a key site on the . seafront. Councils will be urged to concentrate shops into a main retail area and convert empty units into homes (file photo) The news will confirm suspicions that . the original decision to hire Portas was more of a publicity stunt than a . genuine attempt to help struggling high streets. In April, Ms Portas accused the . former Tesco boss, Sir Terry Leahy, of talking ‘crap’ when he described . the rise of supermarkets as progress. She . said: ‘That's absolutely crap. What happens is that 50p of every pound . is spent on food. 'If you take that off the high street and put it into a . 40,000ft out-of-town store and you provide free parking and everything . under one roof, then you start to take away not only the food shops, but . also the chemist, the fashion shops, the butcher… you start to displace . the whole high street.’ A Treasury spokesman said: ‘Small businesses are the backbone of the British economy. ‘We know for many that times have been tough. The Government has focused what help we can give on small businesses.’ Small businesses have been hit by a double whammy of punishing business rates and a persistent reluctance from banks to lend to them, writes Matt Chorley, MailOnline's Political Editor. The economic recovery has continued since the start of the year - growth hit 0.6 per cent the three months to June, double the rate seen in the first quarter. But even with more customers willing to spend, many small firms are struggling to make ends meet. Latest figures show banks cut back lending to small business in 80 per cent of the country's 120 postcodes from 2011 to 2012. Only 22 towns and cities saw lending increase, despite government pressure on the banks to increase funding for struggling companies. Business Secretary Vince Cable said it was 'frustrating'. At the same time business rates charges imposed by councils on company premises wipe out a growing slice of any profits. The Federation of Small Business found one in 14 companies now spend more on business rates than on rent. With another rise in rates due in September, it is feared more companies could go bust.","Nick Boles said council should concentrate shops in 'prime' locations .

A businessman who took a gamble on a little known company in 1980 has been revealed as one of several billionaires who made their fortune thanks to Warren Buffett. Stewart Horejsi's family welding business had been struggling to fight off competition when he first bought 40 shares of Berkshire Hathaway Inc for $265 each. Friends had told him about Buffett, the company's chairman who he went on to model his life on, in a move that has propelled him up the rich list. Growth fund: Stewart Horejsi is now worth more than $1 billion thanks to an investment with Warren Buffett . The 75-year-old father of two is now a billionaire, with a bigger stake in the profitable company than that owned by Bill Gates, the world's richest person - and Buffett's bridge partner. Mentor: Billionaire Warren Buffett inspired Horejsi . He has 4,300 Class A shares of the Nebraska company, giving him a net worth of $1.1 billion, according to Bloomberg. However, the modest man has never appeared on an international wealth ranking. Horejsi's path to his billion-dollar empire began with a modest investment. In 1980 he bought 40 shares in Berkshire for $265 each - an initial investment of $10,600. Two weeks later he bought 60 more shares at $295 each and, a month later, spent $66,000 buying 200 shares at $330. This morning, the 4,300 shares he accumulated in Berkshire since 1980 were valued at $746 million. 'I kept running the [family] business, but I just kept buying Berkshire. I can’t really believe I put so much into one issue, though,' he said. Horejsi was so impressed with Buffett, he has followed several of the billionaire philanthropist's moves. In an interview with Wealth Estates he . said: 'Buffett is one of two people I’ve met in my life that within 60 . seconds of listening to him, you can feel an aura of integrity around . him. It’s very comforting.' When he was 43 Kansas welding supplier Horejsi took a year off to focus on his next move. He read books such as Adam Smith's The Money Game which helped he realize his best opportunity was to invest outside the welding world. 'It was a profitable business, but . companies took their money and bought more trucks,' Horejsi said. 'The . competition just grew.' Horejsi turned his attention to Berkshire, buying up more shares every time the market dipped. Island living: Horejsi has used part of his fortune to buy a luxury villa in Barbados . Low key: Despite his billions Horejsi has never appeared on international wealth rankings and says his biggest extravagance is flying by private jet . As well as investing in Buffett's venture, he also emulates the billionaire's lifestyle in other ways and has remained grounded, living a low-key life between his American homes . and a Barbados villa that has a 300-year-old palm tree in the front yard, according to Forbes. He admitted to the Phoenix Business Journal that his greatest extravagance was flying by private jet, but the Kansas University graduate remains committed to supporting his old campus and other education charities. Despite being a shrewd investor, Horejsi measures his own success in more personal terms, saying: 'If the people you want to love you, love you, then you are a success.'","Stewart Horejsi now owns $746m shares in Warren Buffett's company .

Binge-drinkers too paralytic to look after themselves should be thrown into ‘drunk tanks’ that would cost them more than a room at The Ritz, police chiefs argued today. To tackle Britain's soaring levels of alcohol-fuelled disorder the intoxicated would be forced to pay a fine and £400 for the security and medical staff needed to care for them overnight. Putting drunks into privately-run cells to sober up would allow police to do other work and stop them 'clogging up' accident and emergency departments, senior officers say. It came as a survey of 2,000 police today found that 95 per cent believed too much of their time was taken up dealing with the inebriated. What people face: This is the inside of an Australian drunk tank, with its metal bed and loo, which could be used in Britain . In need of help: Police say they are sick of drunks causing problems and 'clogging up' A&E so want to take action . Time consuming: A large proportion of police and NHS work on Friday and Saturday nights is taken up by the paralytic . These drunk tanks, already used in the . United States, Australia and parts of Europe, would be privately run, . and those put in one would be handed a bill when they left the next . morning. Chief Constable Adrian Lee is . leading a campaign to highlight the harmful effects of alcohol. ACPO lead: Chief Constable Adrian Lee of Northamptonshire argued: 'Why don't we take them to a cell owned by a commercial company and get the company to look after them until they are sober?' He said the . police and NHS should not be responsible for youths who ‘choose to go . out and get so drunk that they cannot look after themselves’. The Northamptonshire Police chief argued: ‘Why don’t we take them to a cell owned by a commercial company and get the company to look after them until they are sober? ‘When that is over we will issue them with a fixed penalty, and the company will be able to charge them for their care, which would be at quite significant cost – and that might be a significant deterrent.’ Drunk tanks were recently backed by Matthew Grove, the Humberside Police and Crime Commissioner. He said in an interview with the trade journal Police Professional: ‘It is quite difficult to work out where the best place to put a drunk is. Is it a police station, or do they need to be at a hospital? ‘A&E departments are under huge pressure, particularly on Friday and Saturday nights. ‘Why should we have drunks clogging up A&E, causing further problems potentially? ‘Why not put them somewhere safe where you could have private medical staff on hand?’ Problem with alcohol: A man is left in a German drunk tank, which could be used in Britain and users could be charged £400 per night . Already in use: Shoes lie abandoned outside a drunk tank at a police station in Paris . Around 50 per cent of all violent crime is alcohol related. Official figures show that offenders are under the influence of alcohol or drunk in nearly half of all incidents of domestic abuse. Alcohol also plays a part in up to a third of child abuse cases. Crime prevention minister Jeremy Browne said today: 'I welcome this campaign to raise awareness of the impact of alcohol-fuelled crime, which costs around £11 billion a year in England and Wales. 'Frontline police officers are all too aware of the drunken behaviour and alcohol-fuelled disorder that can effectively turn towns and cities into no-go areas for law-abiding people, particularly on Friday and Saturday nights.' Mr Lee also criticised the Government for failing to do enough to tackle binge-drinking, after ministers dropped plans for a minimum price for units of alcohol, and Labour's 24 hour drinking laws. The Government shelved the plans in July amid fears the change would hit responsible drinkers. 'I think the cafe culture was an entirely legitimate experiment but I don't think it has worked. 'The impact on the streets of our towns now at three and six o'clock in the morning is very significant and I don't think that is correct and we need to change that. 'But there are lots of positive things that are happening. I think the minimum unit price hasn't gone, we'll think about it again.' A survey of more than 2,000 police officers conducted by ITV's Daybreak found 95 per cent believe too much time is spent on dealing with drunk individuals. Some 95 per cent also believed fewer crimes would be committed if less alcohol was consumed, while 74 per cenmt of the officers surveyed also said not enough is being done to tackle cheap alcohol. Tony Lloyd, Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) for Greater Manchester and chairman of the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners (APCC), said some PCCs are looking at 'drunk tanks', which house inebriated people overnight and allow police officers to deal with other crimes. He said: 'Binge drinking blights towns and cities across England and Wales. 'Police and Crime Commissioners are working to change the culture by working with positive role models such as street pastors who engage with drinkers and offer support to change their ways. 'Some Commissioners are looking at . 'drunk tanks' which house inebriated people overnight and allow police . officers to deal with other crimes.' Matthew Grove, the Humberside Police and Crime Commissioner, asked 'why should we have drunks clogging up A&E, causing further problems potentially?' Diana Johnson MP, Labour's shadow crime and security minister, said: 'We will look at the proposals from Acpo closely as we should always be open to effective new ideas. 'There should, however, be caution about the role of the private sector after our recent experience with G4S and others, who would see this as another money-making opportunity. 'Drunk Tanks though could and should only be one small aspect of any proper alcohol strategy, which would need to start with education in schools right through to licensing enforcement powers. 'The Government's alcohol policy is out of touch and in disarray - dropping their minimum alcohol pricing policy, rejecting drugs and alcohol education in schools, and going ahead with an ineffective 'late night levy'.' A week-long campaign has been launched by police forces highlighting the difficulties faced by those dealing with drunkenness and alcohol-related incidents. The Alcohol Harm initiative will see forces out on the streets with mobile custody suites and medical triage facilities to deal with the drunk and disorderly. Neighbourhood policing teams, special constables, police cadets and volunteers such as street pastors will be deployed in drinking hotspots. And police will be addressing new students at freshers' weeks on staying safe and providing awareness training on vulnerability with security and bar staff. Police chiefs says nearly 50 per cent of all violent crime and domestic abuse is alcohol-related.","Paralytic would be thrown in cell overnight and billed the next morning .

Angry parents have criticised a British fashion chain selling sexy PVC-look clubwear for girls as young as eight. Glasgow-based Internacionale is offering shiny crop tops and leggings, lace crop tops and skintight leopard-print dresses to girls aged eight to 13. Today mothers and children's campaigners condemned the chain, which has 114 stores across the UK and a website, as 'so wrong'. Suitable for an eight-year-old?  Fashion chain Internacionale is selling these sexy crop tops to young children . The clubbing-type clothes were spotted by mother Helen Steel, 35, of Maidstone, Kent as she browsed through the Sophie range of clothes for children at her local branch. 'If I saw an eight-year-old in that stuff I'd wonder what the parents were thinking.  It's essentially sexy clubwear with a label that says ""age eight"", she told the Sun.' London mother-of-two Emily Goodall, 34, founder of Bundlebean, said: 'Children shouldn’t be encouraged to dress in anything that could be perceived as sexy or revealing. 'For their own self esteem I think it is crucial that girls aren’t exposed to the idea of dressing to impress others - and certainly not be pressurised to look alluring.' And Siobhan Freegard, founder of Netmums, said: 'Eight-year-olds girls should be enjoying the innocence of childhood, not being dressed up to look like a lapdancer. 'The manufacturers may try to justify PVC style crop tops and see through lace leggings as harmless fashion and claim children want the styles, but children don't realise the implications of wearing such unsuitable clothes.' Young shoppers at Internacionale are offered a skintight leopard-print skintight minidress or short black skirt . She added: 'Every few months we hear promises . from retailers that they will clean up their act and only sell age . appropriate clothes - but we keep on seeing more examples. 'It's down to parents to reject them. Don't buy them, and the sellers will have to stop.' Justine Roberts, Mumsnet founder, . said: 'It's not about prudishness or hankering after a rose-tinted . picture of childhood, it's about parents knowing in their bones that . there's something wrong with a society that puts pressure on girls as . young as eight to dress up like pole dancers.' Mumsnet founder Justine Roberts, seen with her children, said children should not be dressed 'as pole dancers' Claude Knights, of the Kidscape charity, said the fashion chain had gone against recommendations made in the 2011 Bailey Review into the pressures on and sexualisation of children. She said: 'I think this crosses the line, particularly the crop tops which are shown on the websites with a bust - eight-year-old girls don't have a bust, and while it might be ok for a 15-year-old, it is not ok for an eight-year-old and the retailers should have considered that. 'It is not age appropriate at all.' Internacionale did not respond to MailOnline's request for a comment today. Three years ago Primark was slammed for selling padded bikinis to girls as young as seven. A national outcry ensued when it emerged that it was selling the padded underwear to infants in primary school that culminated in Prime Minister David Cameron denouncing the sale as 'disgraceful'. Primark then abandoned the sale of the tops in April 2010. The following year Matalan came under fire for selling padded bras to girls as young as eight. The pink gingham bras were padded to give the illusion of a bust and were sold on Matalan's website under the heading 'Girls' clothing 3-13yrs'. The fashion chain promised an immediate review of its lines for girls following criticism and said it was committed to only selling clothes that were age-appropriate.","Glasgow-based Internacionale sells 'suggestive' clothing in 'Sophie' range .

With pits prone to devastating fires, explosions and disasters, coal miners took their lives in their hands when they went to work at the industry's early 20th century peak. In the first two decades of the last century alone some 2,000 miners were killed while at work in 31 major disasters at the coal face. And the victims of those disasters were remembered in a macabre and somewhat unusual way - postcards were rushed out to pay tribute to those who died and those who fought to save them. Tribute: A sepia tinted postcard commemorating the deaths of seven miners killed at the Barrow Colliery in 1907. An author has written a history of Edwardian mining using a collection of macabre postcards released following disasters . Tragedy: This simple example of a postcard released following a mining disaster shows the aftermath of an incident at the Hulton Pit in December 1910 . Memorial: This postcard commemorates the death of 168 miners in an explosion at the West Stanley Colliery in Durham . Dangerous work: A second postcard commemorating the 1909 West Stanley explosion shows pictures of all 168 people killed, left, while another shows an image of a group of brothers waiting for the body of one of their siblings at a mine in Hampstead . Author John Hannavy has used a postcard collection - many of which were the work of one family-run studio which printed thousands of the sepia-toned tributes - to compile a history of Edwardian mining. The Gothards from Barnsley would often rush out cards just two or three days after a fatal accident below ground. Some of the examples in Mr Hannavy's fascinating book include a disaster at the Maypole Colliery in Abram, near Wigan, Greater Manchester, which saw 76 men killed in 1908 and a tragic explosion at the West Stanley Colliery that saw 168 miners perish in 1909. Heroes also got recognition for their bravery, courage and sacrifice. In the Hampstead Coilliery disaster in March 1908, one miner Join Welsby lost his life while trying to save of 25 colleagues - 'The Yorkshire Hero' proclaims a postcard tribute to the 31-year-old. Inferno: This postcard was brought out after a fire at the Hamstead Colliery Disaster in 1908 . Lives lost: An explosion at the Maypole Colliery saw just three miners brought out alive . Devastating: 76 men lost their lives at the Maypole Warner Colliery in 1908 . Grim: This postcard commemorates a 1908 disaster at the Midsomer Norton Mine . Hard working: It wasn't just disasters illustrated in the series of postcards. This example shows a group of workers plying their trade in 1898 . Mr Hannavy said: 'The era was the heyday of the picture postcard with hundreds of millions sent every year. 'Coal mining featured heavily - just about every colliery in the country appeared on a postcard featuring mining activity above and below ground. 'They were collected as mementos - and a small percentage of every one sold for - a penny for a plain one and 2p for a coloured one - went to a fund for the families of those miners who lost their lives. 'Many of the cards were beautifully tinted introducing the life of a collier to an ever-wider audience. 'And locally-produced cards commemorated major and minor events - including mining disasters which cost hundreds of lives.' Big business: Most of the postcards were produced by a single family-run Barnsley, Yorkshire, print studio . Hero: The funeral of a miner called J. Welsby is shown in this example of an Edwardian postcard . Brave: This postcode shows the streets of an unknown town packed for the funeral of John Welsby who is described as a 'hero' Graphic: Unidentified bodies shown after an explosion at the Darr Mine in Jacobs Creek . The cards are now considered very collectible - some rare examples can fetch as much as £100. In 1910 the nation’s dependence on coal was so great there were more than 3,200 collieries in Britain producing 264 million tons of the stuff. But the industry has been in decline ever since - in 1979 there were 170 working mines producing 130 million tonnes a year. Going up: Workers are brought to the surface after a hard day at the Tilmanstone Colliery . Helping hand: A pit pony pictured bringing coal to the shaft at the Brayton Colliery . And by 2010 the number of pits had shrunk to just three after cheap foreign imported coal decimated the domestic market. In the first quarter of 2013 the UK pits still producing dug out around 4 million tonnes - while imports during the same three-month period exceeded 12 million tonnes - 15.8 per cent up on the same period in 2012. The book Edwardian Mining In Old Postcards is published by Halsgrove Publishing and costs £9.99. Treacherous: Miners are pictured testing the roof to see if it holds at one colliery .

Prison: Robert McLaughlin, 52, has been jailed for 16 weeks after being caught behind the wheel five times over the limit and dressed as a WPC . A drink driver found slumped behind  the wheel while dressed in a female police officer's uniform has been jailed. Robert McLaughlin, 52, was five times the drink-drive limit when he was discovered at the wheel of a car wearing a  female police top, black trousers and boots, a court heard. He also had a communication earpiece in, with the wire going into  his collar, and a police helmet that belonged to his stepson on the passenger  seat. His solicitor told the court he had been in a relationship with the owner of  the uniform and they would 'occasionally dress up' in her gear. Wakefield magistrates heard a cyclist was nearly knocked down by a car that was trying to  avoid the McLaughlin's Citroen, which was parked diagonally across the road. The cyclist went to confront McLaughlin and found he was 'slumped and  appeared to be wearing a police uniform'. Richard Ogden, prosecuting, said the cyclist described unemployed McLaughlin as 'seeming out of it' and 'totally  and utterly confused' when he spotted him on the road in Ackworth, West Yorkshire,  around 1.50pm on May 28. Believing the drink-driver to be a police officer who 'may have had a stroke', the cyclist called  an ambulance. A roadside breath test then revealed that McLaughlin was five times over the drink driver limit. He was arrested, and then taken to hospital due to the high amounts of alcohol  in his system. A blood test showed he had 366mgs of alcohol in 100mls of blood. The  legal limit is 80mgs. Mr Ogden revealed the articles of uniform belonged  to a female constable with a debilitating medical complaint, who McLaughlin  befriended and helped out around the house. Eventually she gave him a key. 'The officer whose items they were said she was extremely distressed to find  these items had gone missing,' said Mr Ogden. Ban: Wakefield magistrates jailed McLaughlin for 16 weeks and banned him from driving for four years . The fleece McLaughlin, of Wakefield, was caught wearing displayed the officer  in question's details. Since the incident she has changed her name, the court  heard. His stepson is also a police officer and the court was told that the helmet  found in the seat was an old one he had damaged in training. Mr Ogden said a further nine items of police issue equipment and clothing were  found when they searched McLaughlin's home. Ruth Gill, mitigating, told the court that rather than just be befriending the  officer, McLaughlin had been in a relationship with her for 18 months. Mrs Gill said: 'During that time they used to occasionally dress up in the  police stuff that was subsequently found.' At an earlier hearing, McLaughlin admitted drinking and driving and being in  possession of a police uniform while not being a member of a police force or a  special constable. Due to the high level of alcohol in his system McLaughlin was jailed for 16  weeks and banned from driving for four years.","Robert McLaughlin, 52, was found behind the wheel dressed as a WPC .

Court: Police officer Thomas Grant 'ruined' his career by researching a woman he fancied on the force's computers . A police officer illegally used a force computer to access details of a woman he fancied, but was caught out when he accidentally entered the details of the wrong person. Thomas Grant, a Sussex Police constable since 2008, was looking for police records on a woman he was sending text messages to. But Brighton Magistrates’ Court heard today that the 24 -year-old had accessed the records of someone with a similar name - a witness to criminal damage. Juliet Evans, prosecuting, said: 'He fancied her and thought he might have some luck in dating her. 'He was using the police computer for non-policing purposes.' The Sussex Police constable searched the woman's records in the early hours of May 1 while he was on duty at Bognor Police Station. He initially denied any wrongdoing but eventually admitted obtaining data without the consent of the data controller, an offence under the Data Protection Act 1988. Miss Evans said the woman he researched did not know Grant - who has since resigned. She said she was upset when she found out what he had been doing. Kim Goodall, defending, said Grant's actions were 'stupid' and he had 'ruined' his career. She added: 'He's ended his career in the police force. He knew he would be caught - he apologises.' He was fined £800. Speaking after the hearing Grant, of Bognor, West Sussex, said: 'I'm just glad that this is over. 'I just want to thank my friends, family and former colleagues for supporting me.'

Fans of the iPhone 5S have begun lining up outside Apple's flagship store in New York City ahead of its official launch on Friday. The first diehard customers have been spotted camping outside the gadget giant's Fifth Avenue store while iPhone lovers were also beginning to queue at London's Regent Street - one building a makeshift tent. As the fall chill set in in New York, Apple aficionados brought rugs and sleeping bags to make their days-long wait a little more comfortable. Others brought camping chairs and of course their beloved Apple electronics to help the time pass. The madness begins: Fans of the iPhone 5S have began lining up outside Apple's flagship store in New York City ahead of its official launch on Friday . Diehard: The first diehard customers were spotted on Tuesday camping outside the gadget giant's Fifth Avenue store . Passersby snapped pictures of the dedicated campers, posting them to Twitter and Instagram. In case fans somehow forgot, Apple sent out a reminder Tuesday that its iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C are going on sale on Friday. Sales will begin at 8:00 a.m. local time at Apple's retail stores and at 12:01 a.m. PT via Apple's online store. They will also be available through various carriers. The iPhone 5C, the more budget-friendly of the two models, was available for preorder on Friday but Apple has yet to release sales figures for the phone just yet. The iPhone 5S was not made available for preorder. In London, Gad Harari, 17, was spending his second night in a makeshift tent on Regent Street on Tuesday as part of a four-day wait for the latest iPhone model, which comes with an in-built fingerprint scanner. He said he would only consider selling his spot for a four-figure sum. Dedicated: Diehard fan Gad Harari, 17, has set up camp outside the Apple's flagship store in Regent Street, London, in a makeshift tent as part of a four-day wait for the iPhone 5S, which will be released on Friday . Fans: Mr Harari and friend Noah Green, also 17, have said they plan to buy the 5S, which was unveiled for the first time last week . He said he has already refused an . offer of £200 for his place in the queue - predicting that people would . offer up to £1,000 later on. The . teen, who set up camp on Monday with friend Noah Green, also 17, has . been sheltering from the wet weather under a green tent kitted out with . all the latest technology, including one of Apple's MacBook laptops. 'We . are always among the first to get a new iPhone,' said Mr Harari, who is . a familiar face outside the firm's store. 'I came down last night to be . the first - this time we really wanted to be first. 'It's how you really show your dedication to Apple products. As well as that, you do have the opportunity to sell your space.' The student, who . lives in Hendon, London, added: 'I would probably sell my place . in the queue for about £1,000. There are crazy people who are willing to . do that.' Worth the wait? Apple's new iPhone 5S (front) and iPhone 5C (back) have been eagerly awaited by fans. The 5S smartphone is available in three colours - silver, gold and 'space' grey . Both Mr Harari and Mr Green said they plan to buy the 5S, which was unveiled for the first time last week along with Apple's first mid-range phone the 5C. They both go on sale on Friday at 8am. The 5S device, said to be twice as fast as its predecessor, sets itself apart from its competitors with its Touch ID feature. This allows users to unlock their phone and purchase apps with the touch of a finger. Mr Green, from Stanmore, London, admitted he was supposed to be at college this week, but said: 'I don't think they'll mind because (joining the queue) is an ingenious idea. 'I'm really excited. It's going to be incredible, this launch. It's going to be the biggest yet.' The student, who runs his own web business, said he has queued for Apple gadgets for the past four years. 'I collect Apple products,' he said. 'I pretty much have everything that Apple makes.' The 5S - which comes in gold, silver or 'space' grey - is made of high-grade aluminum. The cheaper 5C - introduced at a time when the tech giant arguably faces stiffer competition than ever before - represents Apple's first move away from the high-end market. It comes in at less than $100. Apple usually releases its advance order figures the Monday after a device becomes available for preorder so the lack of any announcement on Monday prompted some to wonder if the iPhone 5C didn't live up to past performance. Meanwhile, the high-end iPhone 5S disappointed Wall Street and revived fears that Apple's most innovative days may be behind it. The phone has a fingerprint scanner to improve security, but analysts said that was not likely to be enough to make the iPhone 5S a sure win in the crowded smartphone market. 'There was nothing transformational announced. It has the fingerprint scan and new colors, but bigger features, like different screen sizes, don't seem to be at the ready. This was less than expected from a company that has a reputation for surprising with a killer product or strategy,' Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia said. The iPhone 5s will reportedly cost $199 or 16GB, $299 for 32GB and $399 for the 64GB model on a plan.","Apple's eagerly-anticipated new iPhone 5S will be launched on Friday .

Patricia Parris was awarded a six-figure pay-out when her son tried to hang himself - but did not declare it . A mother handed a £112,500 payout for her son's injuries after he tried to hang himself while on remand has been convicted of benefit fraud. Patricia Parris received the compensation as a trustee for her son who died just weeks after receiving the money. Her son Robert, 23, suffered serious brain damage after he tried to hang himself at Glen Parva detention centre's healthcare unit, Leicestershire, in October 1999. He had been referred to the unit because of concerns about self-harm. The Home Office was sued through his mother, of Radford, Nottingham and the case centred on what preventative steps medics could have taken. Despite the Home Office denying liability, a judge approved the settlement, and the money went to his mother when he died. Mother-of-three Parris was claiming income support, housing benefit and Job Seeker’s Allowance legitimately, but after receiving the compensation she did not declare it. Nottingham Crown Court heard she had claimed to the benefit authorities that, after expenses, she had only £10,000 of the cash left. But they delved deeper into her finances, finding she had invested her full ISA allowance and bought an annuity with £58,000. She unlawfully pocketed £47,591.65 in benefits over seven years.

Her barrister, Gregor Purcell, said it was an exceptional case and she had not been properly advised regarding her investments. If she had put the money into a discretionary trust for her children, she could have claimed the benefit. 'This isn’t a case that merits a custodial sentence,' said Mr Purcell. Robert attempted to hang himself at Glen Parva detention centre's healthcare unit . 'She has repaid all she can. She is almost penniless and without a home. In my submission, she has been punished enough. 'She will continue to repay the money by direct debit from her bank account. Whatever money she had has been taken from her. 'Had she put the money in a trust, legally removing her entitlement to it, she would have got the benefit. 'She was advised by the bank. 'She may have thought she could do that while still receiving those benefits.' He said Parris visited her son in a nursing home everyday for five years as he lay in a vegetative state. She wiped away tears as Recorder Adrian Redgrave QC gave her a probation supervision for six months. He said: 'It's quite apparent that you have had far more than your fair share of tragedy over the years.'","Patricia Parris, from Nottingham, received the compensation as a trustee for her son Robert, who died just weeks after receiving the money .

Germany is in the throes of a 'grandma export' as one in five Germans say they are considering sending their elderly relatives to a care home abroad. A survey released by German pollster TNS Emnid shows the so-called 'Oma-export' is becoming a trend as the cost of residential care rockets out of the remits of the state insurance. German citizens enjoy long-term care insurance that pays out €1,550 (around £1,300) a month, but this covers less than half of the €3,250 (£2,730) average monthly cost for care inside Germany. Cost of care: The average German care home costs around ¿3,250 (£2,730) per month, compared with ¿1,200 (approximately £1,000) for the same or better care in Poland . The European Commission predicts prices will rise, as the cost of long-term care of the elderly is expected to go up from 1.4 per cent of GDP last year to 3.3 per cent by 2060. By contrast, the average cost of care in a Polish home is just €1,200 (just over £1,000). Aging: More than 15 per cent of Germany's population is expected to be over the age of 60 by 2050 . The German government will pay as much as . €700 (£590) towards nursing care outside the country - enough together with most . elderly people's pensions to cover Polish costs, often with money left . over. In December last year, the German socio-political advisory group Sozialverband Deutschland (VdK) said an 'alarm signal' should be sounded about the number of elderly Germans leaving the country. Researchers said there were 7,146 pensioners living in Hungarian retirement homes in 2011, more than 3,000 in the Czech Republic and more than 600 in Slovakia. Many are concerned about the trend, with journalist Heribert Prantl writing in the newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung of a 'gerontological colonialism' and commenting 'Rubbish is exported... wherever it is cheapest to dispose of them... and now we're exporting our infirm and elderly'. But the new figures also highlight how many Germans have been disappointed by the standard of care in their own country and say Polish nursing homes are not only cheaper, but also better. Ilona von Haldenwang, 66, said she chose a Polish nursing home for her 94-year-old mother after struggling to care for her in her own town of Bad Brueckenau in southern Germany. Her mother had to move from her own apartment to an assisted-living arrangement, which then closed. She then went to a nursing home where Mrs Von Haldenwang slaims her mother lost weight and was given sedatives. The €1,200-a-month Polish nursing home she chose offers 24-hour care, a double room, full board, medical care and a range of therapy programmes. Speaking to Bloomberg news, Mrs Von Haldenwang said: 'I can only say, children, when your . parents get older, send them to Poland.' 'I can only say, children, when your parents get older, send them to Poland' Ilona von Haldenwang, 66, daughter of Polish care home resident . Many top-class Polish facilities now advertise on German-language websites and cater specifically to German clients. One home in the Polish town of Zabelkow in Silesia has German-speaking nurses, lift announcements and emergency call systems in German and shows German Bundesliga football on fancy flat-screen TVs. The kitchen is made by Robert Bosch GmbH and serves classic German meals such as suppers of bread, meat and cheese, and even the teaspoons are made in Germany - as is all the linen and the plastic hygienic gloves worn by staff. Since it opened at Easter, it has filled all its 34 places and six more single rooms are already reserved for when they open in November. However, some have expressed concerns that the distance and the language barrier could lead to people being taken in by false adverts and scams. Higher standards: Germans say Polish care homes can offer more for their relatives, even if they are far from home . One place called Pensjonat Ania in . Tomislaw near the German border, which offered delights such as mushroom hunting excursions for its residents as well as an on-site nurse and ultra-cheap rooms at €400 (£340) a month, was exposed in April to be entirely non-functioning. A report by the Organisation for . Economic Co-operation and Development suggests around 15 per cent of . Germans will be over the age of 80 by 2050.

Decades before mobile phones and a world away from Facebook, Harold 'Johnny' Johnson and Eddie Scott Jones thought it was farewell when they were released from their Nazi prison. After being shot down on separate missions - and parachuting onto enemy soil - the pair met in the barbed-wire cells of Stalag Luft VI, a prisoners of war camp, in 1944. Both aspiring artists, they became inseparable, sitting together and drawing as a way to cope with life as hostages in their icy Lithuanian jail. But when liberation came, life had to go on, so Leeds-born Johnny, 23, and 21-year-old Eddie from Liverpool were forced to part ways. Neither could have imagined, as they were awarded parachute tie pins and bade each other a terse, but emotional farewell, that an accidental meeting would bring them back together - leading to 70 years of friendship. Still together: Artists Johnny Johnson, left, and Eddie Scott-Jones, right, were reunited by chance in Liverpool . Veteran: Eddie Scott-Jones looking through the window of the Halifax Bomber he parachuted out of . Years later, the startled pair were reunited in the comfortable confines of the office café at Pagan Smith advertisers in Liverpool - a step up from their usual backdrop. 'I was working at Pagan Smith advertisers in Liverpool,' Mr Jones, now 91, explained. 'Someone pointed at my tie pin and said ""there's someone else with one of those that works here"".' Curious to meet another parachuter, he followed his colleague along - only to find his friend and fellow inmate proudly wearing his own medal. The caterpillar was given to anyone who had been forced to parachute from their aircraft. Prisoners of war: Eddie, left, and Johnny, right, stuck together in the camp. The would draw their experiences . Bleak: The sight of German guards in the harsh Lithuanian climate outside Stalag Luft VI POW prison camp . Past: Mr Jones sketched out his memory of soaring over enemy lines, picking targets and places to land . Mr Johnson, a tail gunner who flew with 102 Squadron, bailed out of his Halifax aircraft twice - his second landing him clean into Nazi handcuffs. Despite being dubbed ‘golden balls’ by colleagues for always escaping in the nick of time, his luck ran out on December 3, 1942 when his plane was shot down from 15,000ft. It was the bravery of its young pilot, who died in the crash, that led to his survival. Tough: The prisoners of war were forced to plough through the snow beneath gun-manned towers . Light-hearted: Prisoners made light of their horrific situation. Mr Jones's captions make fun of crash landings . Standards: The soldiers were expected to maintain decorum and style throughout the terrifying war . 'I remember going up to the front and he turned round to me and said ""get out - and that’s an order. Go!"",' explains Johnny, who escaped the doomed plane only to parachute directly into the square of a German barracks. Meanwhile Liverpool-born Mr Jones, who flew with the Canadian 428 Squadron, was on his penultimate sortie before being eligible for six months’ leave when he was taken prisoner. 'We’d been bending some railway lines at Lens in northern France,' he explains of the events of April 20 1944. 'We succeeded in blowing up an ammunition train and then set course for home when were pounced on by a JU88, and it started a fire in the fuselage.' Both men eventually ended up in Stalag Luft VI in what is now Lithuania - the German’s northern-most POW camp, where they lived in adjoining huts. Desperate to protect their highest ranking hostages, the Nazis allowed the pair to take it easy. 'As aircrew we weren’t allowed to work, we were too valuable,' Mr Johnson explained. 'That’s how I met Eddie, we used to draw. The camp: A compound surrounded by barbed wire at Stalag Luft VI in what is now defined as Lithuania . Life at war: Mr Jones depicts being faced with the barrell of a gun, left, or 'watching the third reich', right . Marching: The prisoners of war were worked hard as they wondered whether they would make it out alive . 'The Red Cross issued us with a big diary, and so we used to go round to each other, I’d go to Eddie and he’d put something in it, and I’d put something in his.' The two professional artists still reminisce about their time in captivity - documented by a series of sketches Eddie hid from their German guards. 'Ver did you get this bread?', reads the caption on one picture of a Nazi confronting a squaddie. Another shows an airman 'watching the Third Reich' from his plane, while others shows a camp commandant wielding a pistol or marching towards the camp gates. The pair laugh as Mr Jones explains another popular pass-time: winding up their camp guards whenever possible. 'Ver did you get dis bread?': Mr Jones mocks the portly Nazi guard confronting an innocent squaddie . He said: 'We made a great effort for them not to see us depressed. We were always laughing about something or another. 'As a term of punishment - someone had done something, tried to escape or something like that - they’d say ""we’ll close the theatre for a week"". 'And instead of everyone groaning, there was a big cheer and clapping. ""We’ll close it for two weeks"". And there was more clapping and laughing. 'In the end they couldn’t beat us.' When the camp was finally liberated, both Mr Johnson and Mr Jones returned to Britain, ending up in the same city and the same company, raising families and becoming professional artists. Still working together, their drawings have been exhibited across Merseyside and beyond.","Eddie Scott Jones, 21, and Harold 'Johnny' Johnson, 23, were held hostage in Stalag Luft VI prisoner of war camp after parachuting onto enemy soil .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Mia De Graaf . PUBLISHED: . 03:05 EST, 15 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:45 EST, 18 September 2013 . Amanda Knox has announced she will not attend a retrial because she will forever be seen as 'the dark lady who decided Meredith had to die'. The 26-year-old claims her presence animates the courtroom, detracting from the evidence. It follows claims by her co-accused and former boyfriend that Italian police tried to bribe him into framing her. Since overturning a 26-year jail sentence, the American has denied any involvement in the 2007 murder of Leeds University student Meredith Kercher, who was found with her throat slashed in their shared flat in Perugia. Now living in Seattle, she refuses to answer calls to revisit the evidence at a court Florence. Distracting: Amanda Knox said her 'every move' distracted the Italian courtroom from the evidence . Knox told the New York Post nobody in the Perugia court cared about what really happened to Meredith. Branding the court room a 'circus', she claims everybody was more concerned about what she was wearing, how she did her hair or whether she smiled at her parents than the legal proceedings. In an interview with the Sun on Sunday, she said: 'The fact is that my presence has always been a distraction in the courtroom. 'Every single movement I made, every gesture, every facial expression, was the focus of scrutiny and distracted from the evidence in the case.' Knox told the paper she had been portrayed during the first trial as 'the dark lady...who decided Meredith was better than me and had to die'. 'Projecting that image justifies in their minds that I would be capable of committing a crime so heinous as this and therefore validates the guilty verdict in the first trial,' she said. But, she added, finance was also a problem: 'If . it were possible to go to the court and not have to deal with the . issues of being afraid of being thrown back in prison again for an . arbitrary reason, or for being able to financially afford it, absolutely I would want to be there.' Italy's highest criminal court, the Court of Cassation, ruled in March that an appeal court in Florence must re-hear the case against Knox and Raffaele Sollecito for the murder of 21-year-old Meredith Kercher, from Surrey. Sollecito is due to face a retrial on September 30. But Miss Knox's lawyer revealed last month that she will not return to Italy for the new trial. The pair were found guilty in December 2009 of murdering Miss Kercher, with Miss Knox sentenced to 26 years in prison and Mr Sollecito 25. But, after an 11-month appeal in a Perugia court, both convictions were thrown out in October 2011.Prosecutors claimed that Miss Kercher was the victim of a drug-fuelled sex game gone awry. Hitting back: Raffaele Sollecito, who was accused of murdering Meredith Kercher, says the police's handling of his case was 'incompetent'. He claims he was blackmailed into framing Amanda Knox for the crime . Accused: Sollecito says he refused to comply with what police were suggesting because of his 'fondness' for Knox, pictured, and he wrote a letter from his prison cell to his family insisting he would stand by her . Miss Knox and Mr Sollecito have consistently protested their innocence and claim they were not even in the apartment on the night Miss Kercher died. Raffaele Sollecito says 'sneaky' officers instigated a string of approaches from a prison guard, other inmates and even his family as he and his American lover were awaiting trial for the 21-year-old's murder in Perugia, Italy. The Italian added that he feared his lover would succumb to the offer because she was 'out of control'. But Sollecito, 29, said he refused to point the finger of blame at Knox to save his own skin because he was 'really fond of her'. Yet he admits he was terrified Knox, who he had been dating for just a week before the 2007 killing, would do a deal to stitch him up because she was 'out of control'. Tragic: Meredith, 21, was killed in 2007. Sollecito and Knox were both convicted of her murder in 2009 and then cleared . Sollecito claimed detectives told him he would be released immediately if he distanced himself from Knox, saying he should pretend he couldn't remember anything or that he was sleeping in order for the prosecution to catch her. But Sollecito said in the Daily Mirror: 'They did not persuade me. It was the most sneaky situation. I couldn’t invent anything.' But he still 'feared Amanda' and added: 'I knew her for a short time, a week, and in reality I did not really know this woman. I was scared because she was out of control at the police station. She had been making crazy statements and everything was just wrong. 'I thought she could make a deal to blame me. I was scared of that.' Knox was jailed for 26 years and Sollecito for 25 following the trial in 2009. Italian Sollecito said the first 'deal' was when he was in solitary confinement and came about when he his father tried to speak to the proseuction and was told to pass on the message his son should keep his distance from Knox. Other family members urged Sollecito to take the deal and free himself, but he refused to be persuaded and wrote a letter to his nearest and dearest vowing to stand by Knox. Sollecito claimed police then began trying to get him to turn against Knox and that, unless he distanced himself from the American, he would spend the rest of his life in prison. He claims this message was passed to his family in no uncertain terms. His father was allegedly approached by a Perugia lawyer offering a similar deal. Close: Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito can be seen kissing in Italy shortly after they had been named as suspects in the murder of Miss Kercher . Prosecutors claimed that Leeds ­University exchange student Meredith had her throat slashed when a drug-fuelled sex game went wrong. Her grieving family were devastated when Knox and Sollecito were freed on appeal but vowed to keep Meredith’s memory alive.

They have kept out of the public eye and refused to read the books that Knox and Sollecito wrote about their 'ordeal'. But in March the family welcomed news of the retrial and hoped they would finally get answers. No murder weapon was ever found, DNA tests were faulty and prosecutors provided no motive for murder. The pair, along with a third man, were accused of killing Meredith when she refused to participate in the sex game at her hillside home. In a series of confused interviews after their arrest Knox initially claimed to have witnessed the murder and named a local bar owner as the killer. She later withdrew the statement, insisting it had been made under duress, and said she had been at Sollecito’s student apartment throughout the night – which he confirmed. The pair met at a classical music concert and became lovers within hours. Meredith was murdered just a week later. Sollecito said the pair 'were like teenagers in a fantasy romance' but then became friends bonded by the tragedy. The couple were photographed being reunited in New York earlier this year – but he insists there is no romance. Sollecito is often asked if he wished he had never met Knox. He said: 'No, I don’t think like that. I don’t blame her, it is not her fault this nightmare. It is others.' And he claimed his own life is 'in limbo', and that he is without a home. He fears he is a target in Italy for those who still believe he and Knox were involved and worries police will try to seek revenge by planting drugs in his car. Fear: Sollecito, left, said his former girlfriend Amanda Knox, right, was 'out of contol' after their arrest . He has tried to settle in Lugano, Switzerland, and set up a computer software firm – but was kicked out by the Swiss authorities because he failed to disclose details of the murder charges. Sollecito then went to stay with relatives in the US and even got marriage proposals from female murder trial 'groupies'. He has now moved to a secret location in the Caribbean, where he is currently trying to establish a business.' Knox’s lawyers have insisted she will not be at the retrial in Florence and Sollecito said he will wait until after the first of eight scheduled hearings to see 'which way the court is going'. Victim: The pair were found guilty in December 2009 of murdering Meredith Kercher but after an 11-month appeal both convictions were thrown out in October 2011 . Sollecito feels victimised and slammed the police handling of the case, saying everything about the investigation was handled 'wrong' and that officers were 'incompetent' and 'fools'. Despite his own grievances, he insists he hasn't forgotten the pain of Meredith's family, saying he 'can't imagine their suffering'. But he urged them to read the case documents and ask questions about what really happened instead of sticking by the 'theory' of what happened. 'If you accept only the prosecution case you will never find what is right and what really happened,' he added.","Cleared Knox claims her every movement 'distracted from the evidence'

They are instantly recognisable - iconic photographs that immediately prompt the viewer to remember classic Hollywood films. American Beauty is immediately obvious by the scene of Mena Suvari spread across a bed of roses, while most would automatically think of the blockbuster Matrix when they see Keanu Reeves clad in a long leather coat while spinning through the air. But now two talented photographers have transformed these Hollywood images by giving them an African makeover. The idea behind the Onomolliwood series is to pay tribute to iconic moments of cinema which have highly influenced the two talented photographers . Mena Suvari in American Beauty, shot in 1999, made an impact on the photographer duo, who wanted to pay homage to cinema that influence them . Omar Victor Diop, who is Senegalese, teamed up with French-American photographer Antoine Tempé to create Onomolliwood - a fresh perspective of classic photographs using African models and slightly different details. Instead of a bed of roses for the American Beauty scene, lush green plants were used to cover the model's modesty. Breakfast in Tiffany's has an African model pulling the same coy smile, but wearing a white dress instead of Audrey Hepburn's classic black one. The glittering jewellery, cigarette holders and scattered tea things on the table has been lovingly recreated. The scene of Thelma and Louise, where . Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon stare into the distance while police . cars can be seen approaching them in the distance. The scene is given a fresh twist in . the project, with the same dusty background used, and the . defiant-looking models gaze through the windscreen, just as the . actresses did in the 1991 film, which also starred Brad Pitt. The have headscarves wrapped around their heads, echoing the costumes used in the film. But it is a motel, instead of a group of police officers, that looms behind the models. The 1966 thriller Blow Up also features in the project, with the new photographs mimicking the scenes that film fans know and love. Just like David Hemmings, an actor kneels over an actress who is splayed across the floor, apparently dead, as he takes a photograph of her. Frida, the film based on the Mexican artist and starring Selma Hayek, is recreated by the pair of photographers - complete with Kahlo's famously bushy eyebrows . According to CNN, Diop said of his collaboration with photographer Antoine Tempé to recreate the stunning shots: 'I wanted to imagine what these movies would look like if they were conceived and shot in Africa. 'We started working with the movies we liked, the movies that had influenced us. 'I remember watching in the 1980s the same movies as the young people of Paris and New York and maybe Bangkok. The two Dakar-based photographers recreated the Matrix scene where Keanu Reeves defies physics to contort his body to swerve a bullet . Strike a pose! Keanu Reeves' pose was perfectly recreated in the shot, but given a green tint to give it a fresh perspective . Thelma and Louise is given a fresh look in this shot, as the two models stare into the distance, just like the original stars did . Geena Davis starred as Thelma and Susan Sarandon took on the role of Louise in the famous 1991 film . 'At the end of the day we're all the same young people regardless of where you were born and where you were raised and somehow I wanted to show this also through the choice of movies in the series. Omar Victor Diop is a Senegalese photographer whose extensive work ranges from fashion photography to conceptual projects. He offers a new perspective on contemporary African aesthetics, his Facebook page says. Diop has earned a reputation as a rising name in his hometown scene, Okay Africa reported. The hairstyle, outfit and coy smile mimic Breakfast at Tiffany's - made famous by Audrey Hepburn . The 1966 thriller Blow Up is given a fresh look here, as Tempe and Diop wanted to conceive of a Hollywood if it had been Africa-based . The film starred David Hemmings, who starred alongside Jane Birkin as a photographer who believes he may have witnessed a murder and unwittingly taken photographs of the killing . Though his work has been featured at . exhibitions around the world, it was not until the success of his first . conceptual project, Fashion 2112 in 2011 that he retired from a career . in corporate communications in order to focus on photography. Antoine Tempé is a French-American photographer who documents contemporary African cultural scenes through photojournalism and portraiture. He currently lives and works in Dakar, Sénégal. It is no wonder that the duo turned to Western films for their inspiration. The Senegalese film scene is a relatively small industry. It has produced just five feature films in the last decade. The artists had a long history and a variety of movies to choose from if they picked Hollywood productions - whereas the first Senegalese film was only made in 1955. It was not until the Independence of Senegal in June, 1960, that the West African country's industry began to develop. The 1970s is often considered to be the golden years' for the industry. Production flourished and a variety of award-winning films were made. But by 1980, despite the country producing five full length films a year and numerous short films - no mean feat considering it had just a handful of directors and professionals to create such works - the industry began to collapse. Funding became a crippling issue - the country could not provide the domestic resources and finance needed to help the industry flourish, and people could not afford to keep making the films. Foreign funding was needed to produce the films, and instead of the movies being premiered in Senegal, they would have been expected to be shown abroad instead.

Eye drops containing cholesterol-busting drugs could combat one of the most common causes of blindness . Eye drops containing cholesterol-busting drugs could combat one of the most common causes of blindness, according to new research. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a painless condition which leads to the gradual loss of the central vision. It is thought that aging, smoking and genetics can all increase a person’s chance of developing the condition. However, it is also thought to be triggered by harmful blood fats. Experiments on mice have found that deposits of this cholesterol contribute to the development of the condition. Patients who have hardened arteries – which are also caused by harmful blood fats - often are prescribed medications to lower cholesterol and keep arteries clear. Now, a study published in the journal Cell Metabolism suggests that some of those same drugs could be used to treat patients with macular degeneration. Professor Rajendra Apte said: ‘Based on our findings, we need to investigate whether vision loss caused by macular degeneration could be prevented with cholesterol-lowering eye drops or other medications that might prevent the build-up of fats beneath the retina.’ An estimated 500,000 people in the UK suffer from AMD, and 40 per cent are over the age of 75. The new research centres on immune cells known as macrophages that remove cholesterol and fats from tissues. In macular degeneration, the excessive build-up of cholesterol begins to occur as we age, and our macrophages begin to malfunction. In the less aggressive form of AMD, doctors examining the eye can see lipid deposits beneath the retina. As those deposits become larger and more numerous, they slowly begin to destroy the central part of the eye, interfering with the vision needed to read a book or drive a car. Some of the drugs used to treat people with hardening of the arteries could be used to treat patients with macular degeneration . Professor Apte’s researchers at the University of Washington found macrophages taken from old mice and patients with macular degeneration have inadequate levels of a protein called ABCA1 which transports cholesterol out of cells. As a result, the old macrophages accumulated high levels of cholesterol and could not inhibit the growth of the damaging blood vessels that characterise the more advanced form of the disorder. AMD is a painless eye condition that leads to a gradual loss of the central vision. It's the most common cause of visual impairment in the UK. It causes central vision to become blurred resulting in symptoms such as difficulty reading and problems recognising people's faces. It usually affects both eyes but the speed of progression can vary between eyes. It occurs when the macular - the part of the eye responsible for central vision - stops functioning effectively. It is thought to be triggered by aging, smoking and genetics. Does not affect the peripheral vision so does not cause complete blindness. There is currently no cure for the most common form of AMD - dry AMD. But when the macrophages were treated with a substance that helped restore levels of ABCA1, the cells could remove cholesterol more effectively, and the development of new blood vessels was slowed. Co-author, Dr Abdoulaye Sene, said: ‘We were able to deliver the drug, called an LXR agonist, in eye drops. And we found we could reverse the macular degeneration in the eye of an old mouse. ‘That is exciting because if we could use eye drops to deliver drugs that fight macular degeneration, we could focus therapy only on the eyes, and we likely could limit the side effects of drugs taken orally.’ Since macrophages are important in thickening of the arteries and in the formation of new blood vessels around certain types of cancerous tumours, the same pathway also might provide a target for more effective therapies for those diseases. Professor Apte said: ‘We have shown we can reverse the disease cascade in mice by improving macrophage function, either with eye drops or with systemic treatments. ‘Some of the therapies already being used to treat thickening arteries target this same pathway, so we may be able to modify drugs that already are available and use them to deliver treatment to the eye.’ The Royal National Institute for Blind People is currently running an awareness campaign about AMD.

A bartender was given what may be one of the biggest tips in history - well, almost. Unfortunately for the St Louis restaurant worker, the $200,000-plus thank you was rejected by the debit card company of the person who was apparently trying to make the gesture. An internet user going by the name 'randomdazee' and claiming to be a bartender in the Missouri city posted a picture of a receipt on the social news site Reddit - with $200,000 handwritten in the space for a tip. In his post, the waitress - who described herself as a bartender and server and was named 'Sara' on the receipt - said two women and a man had come into the restaurant and ordered a meal amounting to $111.54. As the tipper apparently could not add up, the receipt suggested the waiter could have gone home with $210,889. But when the waiter spoke to Visa, the debit card company, she said she was told that the bank would not pay out on 'excessive tips' - sparking claims from other internet users that this was a scam to get out of paying the bill. The post by randomdazee began: 'Today the absolute weirdest thing happened to me, ever. 'We're pretty slow during lunch shifts. I was working by myself and had literally only had one table the entire shift when about a half hour before close two mid-20s sisters walked in and said another person would be meeting them. 'I had been bored the entire shift and basically just filling the time with doing mundane cleaning tasks so actual human interaction was pretty exciting. They were pretty nice. 'One of the sisters was taking the other out after she had gone through a pretty big personal trauma and she obviously wanted to show her sister a good time. They ordered quite a few things and a gentleman met them.' The post went on to describe how the bartender never expected the tip, despite one of the women dropping lots of hints throughout the meal. Scam: Reddit users suggested the diners were trying to get out of paying the bill rather than being as generous as they seemed . 'Throughout the meal the sister that was treating the other one would flag me down and talk with me and kept saying things like “Don’t tell my sister how I tip.” “Today I’m your guardian angel.” Etc., etc.,' the post read. 'I’ve worked in restaurants forever and can tell you from experience that usually people who say things like this are full of s***. Generous: The waiter said the woman had boasted that she was going to leave him a big tip . 'But she seemed to be tossing a LOT of cash around to her guests and the situation was just bizarre. She asked for the check only a few minutes after we closed (which is super nice and courteous anyway, often we have people walk in right before we close and hang out for ages which forces me to stay later).' Then came the big moment: . 'She signed the receipt (paid with a normal looking Visa debit) after I brought her the check. I don’t like to be rude and look at or pick up the checks before the person has left and since she told me explicitly not to react to the check in front of her sister I especially didn’t want to on this check. 'They leave and I look at the receipt and yeah. $200,000.' But any sense that that she had just hit the jackpot was quickly snubbed, as the post went on to describe what happened when the bartender went to declare her tip. 'Being realistic and not insane I immediately ran to get my manager. He was in a meeting but the corporate office for our entire restaurant is two floors above the restaurant I work at so I ran up there to grab someone and they were empty too. 'I called the marketing director who I had just seen previously and my manager finally gets back from the meeting he was in and the marketing director and my manager were both as incredulous as I was. 'They decided to call the credit card processing company. I basically couldn’t function at this point because even though I was pretty suspicious it’s still pretty life changing to even think about getting that kind of money just for being courteous and doing your job.' Source: The Week . The bartender said that Visa had bad news for her. 'Basically, the gist of it is that banks don’t honor payouts on excessive tips,' she wrote. '(Apparently they can bounce back tips that are even over 30% of the bill… which is kind of crazy because I often receive those kind of tips on tabs of regulars or other industry workers.) 'Although they did say that things like this actually happens pretty often like when someone wins the lottery or a jackpot at the casino, receives a lot of money in a settlement or inheritance, or was already wealthy but terminally ill with little time left. I guess nobody actually ever gets the payout on it. 'I didn’t even attempt to close out the check for $200,000 obviously so who knows if that kind of money was even in the account. But yeah, it was still a pretty exciting and crazy afternoon. 'I wish I could get a hold of my “guardian angel” and at least thank her for the entertainment haha. And if it was real, I’d thank her for the sentiment at least. It’d be cool to know why she was possessed to give me of all people that kind of money.' Responses on the site suggested that the woman who left the tip knew full well what she was doing. 'SHE WAS TRYING TO SCAM YOU!' wrote one user. 'Basically it gets the guest out of paying their bill. If the server were to reconcile their transactions at the end of the night the entire transaction would be flagged and a stop payment would be put in place immediately. 'If by some miracle the transaction were approved all the cardholder has to do is call in and say its fraud, boom charges reversed.' 'That is a common scam,' wrote another. 'I used to be a bartender, and every once in a while that would happen. The person just has to put something ""impossible"" on the bill, and Visa will not process it.' Visa has yet to respond with a statement on their credit card regulations.","Picture posted on Reddit of receipt with $200,000 tip .

His face flushed with excitement, this is the astonishing moment Jeff Bauman walked for the first time since losing both of his legs in the Boston Marathon bombings. The 27-year-old revealed his amazing determination as he took his first steps at the end of May - just six weeks after the incident changed his life and set him on the long and painful road to recovery. An iconic photograph taken on the day of the Boston Marathon bombings showed Bauman gray-faced with his legs shredded by the blast as he was rushed to the medical tent. Throughout the months since, he has shared his physical and emotional struggles with the New York Times, which captured the inspiring moment he walked again. Scroll down for videos . Boston strong: Jeff Bauman, who lost his lower legs in the Boston Marathon bombings, walks on his own for the first time since the marathon as his girlfriend, left, and a prosthetist, right, look on . Bauman explained that he had been near the finish line with two friends to cheer for his girlfriend, Erin Hurley, as she finished the race when he spotted a suspicious-looking man five feet from him. He noted - and later told investigators - that the man was wearing a baseball cap, sunglasses and a heavy coat, which Bauman thought was bizarre for a warm day. Suddenly the man vanished and, just as Bauman noticed he'd left a backpack behind, a massive explosion detonated, forcing Bauman and his friends to the ground. Thinking at first it was a firework, he sat up and was horrified to see the area strewn with blood and injured spectators. He looked for his friends and noticed one staring at his legs in shock. Life-changing: Carlos Arredondo pinches Bauman's femoral artery as they rush from the blast site moments after the April 15 bombing in Boston. Bauman lost both lower legs and much of his hearing . Pain: He grimaces as he has the sutures removed from what was left of his legs at Boston Medical Center on May 15 - a month after his legs were destroyed by the bombs as he cheered for his girlfriend . Getting ready: Bauman holds a prosthetic leg similar to the ones he will receive at United Prosthetics in Dorchester, Massachusetts on May 21 - ten days before he walked for the first time since the marathon . He looked down at his shredded limbs . and then back at her, unable to believe what he was seeing - no lower . legs and bones jutting from the bloodied wounds. Overwhelmed, he lay down and Allen Panter, an . emergency room physician who had been in the crowd, rushed over and . secured tourniquets around his legs before racing to save others. 'I'm going to die,' Bauman thought as he laid on his back, alone. At that point, Carlos Arredondo - the man wearing a cowboy hat pictured beside Bauman in the iconic image - ran over to him and lifted him into a wheelchair. Arredondo pinched Bauman's femoral artery closed to stop the blood pumping from his destroyed legs and ran beside the wheelchair as they raced for the medical tent. When he was loaded to the ambulance, Bauman said a woman was speaking to him to keep him alert - and he realized he was unable to hear. Upbeat: On May 28, he practices ahead of throwing the ceremonial first pitch for a Boston Red Sox game later that day in Chelmsford, Massachusetts, where he is living with his mother . Resolve: Bauman acknowledges cheering fans before throwing out the ceremonial first pitch at Fenway Park . For more videos, please go to MLB . His right eardrum was destroyed when . the bomb detonated, and his left one suffered a sizable hole, which . doctors have said is unlikely to heal. On . the day of the bombings, he underwent an emergency amputation to remove . his legs at the knees, and two days later, flesh was amputated until . four inches above the knees. In the weeks after the explosion, Bauman struggled with pain and boredom. Two weeks on, and he was still being kept awake by burns on his back and by the pains in his thighs. He told the Times that he felt as if someone was hitting his knees. He also struggled to adjust to his loss of hearing, and said he felt as if he had something held over his ears. The frustrations and echoes still mean he can only play music for a few minutes and is uncomfortable in large rooms. Reunited: Bauman and Arredondo are pictured together in hospital just days after the deadly bombings . But he has refused to undergo surgery to close the hole in his left eardrum because he cannot face anymore operations, he said. As . he started to heal from his operations, he spent days in hospital . undergoing physical therapy, watching television and getting visits from . friends and his girlfriend - the highlight of the day. He said that in those following weeks, he accepted what had happened and while he couldn't look at his legs, he would surprise people by joking about them as a way to cope. He added that he didn't think of the bombers and only called them cowards when someone asked. Bauman left the rehabilitation center around four weeks after the bombings and returned to his mother's home in Chelmsford, Massachusetts. He would spend all day with his mother, with the only change in pace coming from his cousin, who came over to play computer games, and from his girlfriend, who would visit after work. Staying strong: Bauman is pictured with his girlfriend, Erin Hurley. He said her visits to hospital or to his home are the highlights of his day and that he is looking forward to a future with her . Together: The couple had been together for around a year before the Boston bombings . Support: Bauman (left), who still enjoys playing the guitar for as long as his damaged ears can take it, and Hurley are pictured with another Boston bombing victim in hospital . Eventually, he began to venture out more . - but said he would rarely pay for anything because people recognized . him and would shower him with praise and pick up his tab. He has also made appearances at local games, including throwing the first pitch at Fenway Park - and has become firm friends with Carlos Arredondo, whom he was reunited with in hospital. And he is also learning to walk after being fitted with the prosethetic legs. Images taken on the day of his first walk show him grinning as he tries out his first steps. His girlfriend stood nearby and watched apprehensively as he moved forward, but he assured her that he felt balanced. Now Bauman is looking to the future - and hopes to one day buy a house with his girlfriend. He said that the tragedy has brought them much closer and made them more affectionate.

Before the bombings, Bauman worked in the delicatessen at a local Costco. He told the Times he had intentions of returning but that he was worried about being able to stand up all day. He said he had also thought about a career helping other people. Online fundraisers have helped raise enough money to cover his medical costs - and he has received nearly $3 million from donations and from the One Fund, which helps the Boston victims.

A survey of different types of cat found the pedigree breed to be the most affectionate, whereas Britain’s most common variety – the non-pedigree shorthaired domestic moggy – is the most unfriendly.

Despite their reputation for being . aloof and solitary, the research found that many cats are far friendlier . than they are given credit for. Pure-breds were found to be the most amiable, with the  Sphynx – which sell for around £800 – coming top of the list. And non-pedigrees were found to be the most likely to ignore their owners, shy away from affection and flee from strangers. Dr Marie Abitbol, of the National . Veterinary School of Alfort in Paris, where the study was carried out, . said: ‘There is a clear difference in friendliness between the pure-bred . cats and the domestic shorthaired. In general, the pedigree cats are . friendlier than non-pedigree.’ It is thought the Sphynx’s . affectionate nature, which even extends to a happiness to visit the vet . or be bathed, is due to its reliance on humans to keep warm. The survey said pedigrees may also be . friendlier because breeders tend to leave kittens with their mothers for . longer, during a crucial period in their development when they are . becoming used to humans. The animals studied ranged from . kittens to more than 20 years old. They were a mix of males and females, . with some neutered and some not.

Birmans, Somalis, Siamese, Russian blues and exotic shorthairs were all ranked fourth . 5. The domestic shorthair - or the common moggy - scored lowest .

The owners were asked a mix of . questions, including how their cat would react when they entered a room, . how often it would rub up against them, whether it would appear to . avoid them, and how it would behave around strangers and vets. Each cat was then ranked according to friendliness, based on the answers. The Sphynx scored an average of 22.83, compared with 18.93 for the domestic shorthaired. Because the numbers of other breeds in . the survey were generally small, they were grouped together to score an . average for pedigrees of 20.40. In cases where there were more than a . handful of a particular breed, they were found to be friendlier than . moggies. Maine Coons and Persians, for instance, scored 20.76 and 20.38 . respectively.

Fraudsters who duped first-time drivers into buying bogus car insurance were found to be running a fake-call centre with a soundtrack of office noise in the background, a court heard. Danyal Bukharee, 42, masterminded the scam which involved setting up a series of 'ghost broking websites' offering premiums 15 per cent cheaper than the average. Bukharee invented a host of staff to deal with customer enquiries and payments - including one named after the head of the City of London Police’s insurance fraud department. On trial: Andrew Goward, 38, was recruited alongside co-defendants Saleh and Heaven to open bank accounts and to receive the money paid by the victims . The fraudsters played a track called 'Office Noise' through an iPod connected to loudspeakers, it is claimed, to give the illusion of a busy office. Jurors heard Bukharee had pleaded guilty to operating the scam involving the four websites between May 2011 and April last year. Four others are now on trial at the Old Bailey for either laundering the proceeds or directly assisting with the scam. Detectives were alerted to the scam after the Motor Insurers Bureau received complaints about three car insurance websites - Aston Midshires Insurance, Astuto Insurance and Car Insurance Warehouse - in October 2011. The investigation led to a riverside apartment in Battersea, south west London, along with the discovery that Bukharee had set up a new website, First Car Direct Insurance. ‘It was a fraud factory,’ said prosecutor Ann Mulligan. ‘There were printers, faxes, telephones, bank cards, chequebooks, mobile phones, shredders. ‘Bukharee had realised the earlier websites were under investigation and had decided to set up a new campaign.’ A . total of £40,733 had been paid by 38 customers for car insurance in the . three weeks the First Direct website was up and running, the court . heard. Mohamed Saleh, 26, was brought into the scam by mastermind Danyal Bukharee. The court heard that Saleh and his co-defendants must have 'at very least suspected' that what they were being asked to do was criminal . Miss Mulligan said: ‘The case involves a ghost broking website fraud - a website created for the purposes of fraud. ‘It is not in dispute that this was a sophisticated fraud and it was masterminded by Danyal Bukharee. ‘He used the four ghost broking websites to carry out car insurance fraud. He was responsible for setting up the websites, each of them purporting to offer genuine motor insurance at around a 15 per cent discount below the average price offered by genuine companies. ‘Unsuspecting members of the public were duped into buying this non-existent car insurance and paying money for it. ‘What he identified was he could target innocent members of the public, in particular young first time drivers for whom insurance premiums are extremely high, often inhibitively so.’ It is claimed Bukharee recruited Giovanni Recchia, 47, to run the First Car Direct fraud from the flat by answering phones and dealing with customer enquiries. Recchia was with Bukharee when police arrived at the flat and acted as a witness to the tenancy agreement, the court heard. Detectives found a whiteboard featuring the names of nine invented employees next to their roles in claims, admin and compliance, it is claimed. One victim remembered being put through to David Wood in sales and offered a quote of £2,018 for insurance, jurors were told. Miss Mulligan said: ‘You may think Bukharee has a sense of humour. Detective Chief Inspector David Wood is in fact head of the Insurance Fraud Enforcement Department.’ Police also found an iPod connected to sound system with only one track uploaded titled ‘Office Noise.’ ‘Officers listened to the track through the speaker system and what they heard being played was a busy working office, the sound of ringing phones, a call centre effect.’ Jurors heard Recchia is likely to claim he was an innocent dupe and was led to believe this was a genuine business. ‘Recchia cannot have failed to be aware that something was amiss,’ said Miss Mulligan. 'Using a name that wasn’t his has to have alerted him to the fact this was a fraudulent enterprise.’ Giovanni Recchia allegedly ran First Car Direct fraud from a flat by answering phones and dealing with customers, prosecutors said he 'cannot have failed to be aware that something was amiss' Andrew Goward, 38, Gary Heaven, 37, and Mohamed Saleh, 26, were recruited to open bank accounts to receive the money paid in by the victims, it is claimed. ‘Once these were opened Bukharee would take over control of the accounts to enable him to access the money,’ said Miss Mulligan. ‘These three men may not have known it was a car insurance fraud specifically but what the Crown say is that at the time they opened bank accounts they did so in circumstances such that it can safely have been inferred they must have known or at the very least suspected they were doing it for criminal purposes.’ Goward is said to have received proceeds from the Astuto Insurance and Car Insurance Warehouse between May and August 2011. Heaven and Saleh are said to have received the proceeds from the Aston Midshires Insurance fraud between August 2011 and January 2012. Buckharee, from Putney, south London, has admitted two counts of fraud by false representation and three counts of money laundering. Recchia, from Retford, Nottinghamshire, denies one count of fraud by false representation. Heaven, from Tulse Hill, south London, Goward, from Nottingham, and Saleh, from Greenford, north west London, all deny money laundering. The trial continues.

Sci-fi has long been fascinated by the idea of creating a race of people with superhuman intelligence, but two experts have now argued that this is far from a good idea. Theoretical neurobiologist Mark Changizi, and philosopher Mark Walker, have both spent more time contemplating the issue than most. In an interview with io9, the pair explained the problems. They believe that excessive amounts of intelligence could have negative consequences for the person, causing maladaptation, anti-social behaviour, and even psychosis. Sci-fi has long been fascinated by the idea of creating a race of people with super intelligence (such as Mr Spock from Star Trek), but two experts have now argued that this would not prove to be a good thing . Their findings come at a time when people are obsessed with intelligence, IQ, and the pursuit of endless knowledge. They also believe that the concept is difficult as intelligence is hard to define and factors such as morals and empathy could be overlooked. Mr Walker explained to io9: 'Transhumanists, when they say that intelligence ought to be enhanced, almost never mean some kind of social intelligence. 'They rarely talk about other forms of intelligence, like enhanced empathy, or understanding what it means to promote another person's well-being.' He added: 'Just because you have intelligence in the IQ sense doesn't necessarily mean you have a universal instrument to help you get everything else you want in your life.' Mr Changizi explained that the issue is how we define intelligence - and therefore, what we mean when we say that we would like to create people with superhuman intelligence. He believes that people tend to think of intelligence as something that the human brain is not particularly good at - for example, being able to play chess, or solve logic problems. He went on to explain that things people are naturally good at, such as things that come instinctively, we do not see as part of our intelligence. They believe that being extremely clever (like Albert Einstein) could have negative consequences for the person, causing maladaptation, anti-social behaviour, and even psychosis . He told io9 that people are not aware of their brain doing these things, so do not tend to view them as connected to intelligence. Mr Walker agrees that people tend to have too simplistic a view of intelligence. He says that people who try to turn intelligence into a narrow category are oversimplifying it. For example, he notes that there are people who are really good at solving mathematical problems but who are almost incapable of stringing a sentence together. The experts believe intelligence is hard to define and factors such as morals and empathy could be overlooked. Sheldon Cooper from The Big Bang Theory is known for being very intelligent but lacking emotion . He worries that if people were give superhuman intelligence, it would be almost impossible to enhance all of the areas that could constitute intelligence. He argues that because everyone values different areas of intelligence, if everyone boosted the area of intelligence that they consider to be important, it would result in worse outcomes. For example, Mr Walker worries that people might end up amazingly good at something like maths, but totally lacking in emotional or moral intelligence. This, he believes, could result in people using their talents for evil. As a result, he thinks the only way that it could work would be to boost intelligence at the same rate as self-reflection and modesty. Mr Walker is also concerned that because the human brain is not designed to be super intelligent, it might respond to boosting by becoming maladjusted or even psychotic. The experts believe that there could, however, be solutions. Mr Changizi believes that the way to make people brilliant is to harness the brain's natural instincts. He believes that in the future it will be more important to people to be able to enhance these factors to allow us, for example, to navigate new places, than to enhance the sort of intelligence that related to things like maths. In contrast, Mr Walker believes that the most valuable thing would be to boost people's ability to be happy. He thinks that people who are happy are more successful in a wide range of areas, such as in their relationships, their work and their social lives.","Theoretical neurobiologist Mark Changizi, and philosopher Mark Walker say we are obsessed with achieving ever greater intelligence .
But they warn it could lead to anti-social behaviour and psychosis .
Say that if people become extremely clever but their moral intelligence is not boosted as well, they could use their powers for evil ."

A former model embroiled in the investigation of the murder of a serving police officer claimed she too was a victim at her first court appearance yesterday. Traci Vaillancourt was brought into Salt Lake City's 3rd District Court in a wheelchair and was breathing with the help of an oxygen tank when she answered two counts of obstruction of justice. The 34-year-old was allegedly shot in the back on September 1 by her boyfriend Timothy Troy Walker, who faces the death penalty for allegedly shooting and killing father-of-one Sgt Derek Johnson in an earlier ambush. Charges: Traci Vaillancourt argued she too was a victim of Timothy Walker, who is accused of murder . Wheelchair: Vaillancourt was wheeled into court and was breathing with the help of an oxygen tank . Vaillancourt's lawyer Ryan Holtan said: 'She was shot by somebody who is a terrible person. 'He killed a police officer. That is absolutely reprehensible. She is another victim in that case.' Mr Holtan told reporters after the hearing that he did not believe his client had meant to mislead officers investigating the murder of their colleague, according to The Salt Lake Tribune. Vallaincourt was shot in the back by Walker and the bullet became lodged in her sternum. She was charged with obstruction for allegedly lying about the incident. Mr Holtan added:'I can only imagine the kind of trauma that creates.' During her appearance, she only spoke to confirm the spelling of her name and date of birth. Walker, 34, had also been due to appear yesterday, but his medical condition prevented him from doing so. Timothy Walker has been charged with aggravated murder over the death of a Utah police officer. His mugshot shows the extent of his injuries from a self-inflicted gunshot wound . After allegedly shooting his two victims, Walker shot himself in the head, but survived. Salt Lake District Attorney Sim Gill said Walker suffered 'a lot of trauma to his mouth and jaw,' which may affect his ability to speak. Walker is charged with first-degree murder for Johnson’s death. He is also charged with attempted murder for allegedly trying to kill Vaillancourt, three counts of discharge of a firearm and one count of possession of a weapon by a restricted person. Killed: Father-of-one Sgt Derek Johnson was fatally shot when he stopped alongside Walker's Volvo in Draper on September 1 . Both Walker and Vaillancourt were homeless and believed to be living in their car. Walker was said to have been high on meth when he allegedly ambushed Sgt Johnson, who was believed to have been sitting in his police car and September 1, and shot him in the chest. On Wednesday, prosecutors said he could face the death penalty. Walker, 35, has been charged with a first-degree count of aggravated murder over the killing of the 32-year-old officer, who was a married father of a young son. He also has been charged with attempted homicide for allegedly trying to kill his girlfriend Traci . Vaillancourt, a former model left disfigured and hooked on painkillers following a rare blood disease. District . Attorney Sim Gill told the Salt Lake Tribune that the death penalty is . 'on the table' but prosecutors would wait until after the preliminary hearing . and arraignment. Proud dad: Derek Johnson is pictured with his son Bensen . The suspect was booked into Salt Lake County Jail on Wednesday after his release from hospital following treatment for a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Vaillancourt was also hospitalised after her boyfriend allegedly shot her in the back. She was released on Saturday and booked into Salt Lake County Jail. She was charged on Wednesday with two counts of obstructing justice for allegedly lying to investigators over what had happened. Sgt Johnson was married to his high school sweetheart Shante Sidwell with whom he had a six-year-old son Bensen. His funeral was held last Friday where the community paid tribute to man described as a dedicated public servant. Speaking in response to the crime, . Vaillancourt's sister Victoria King has revealed her sister's tragic . demise from aspiring model and TV star to drug-addled homeless woman . reliant on her violent boyfriend. Accused: Timothy Walker (left) has been charged with the murder of Sgt Derek Johnson and his girlfriend Traci Vaillancourt (right) charged with lying to police . After having her first child, Vaillancourt was diagnosed with a rare blood disorder called Hereditary Angioedema which made her face, throat and limbs swell, her sister told KSL.com. She says her sister quickly became addicted to her pain medication after suffering four strokes before the age of 30. 'It just went downhill from there,' King told the broadcaster. 'I tried to get him away from her. She chose a different path. … He was bad news from the get-go, I knew it, and the two of them combined, and a loaded gun nonetheless, and strung out on drugs.' 'We tried and tried and tried to help her but you can't help someone who won't help themself,' she added. Happily married: Derek Johnson grew up in Draper and married his high school sweetheart. He was described as a dedicated police officer . King last saw her sister and Walker, 35, the day before the shootings and was left startled by his behavior. 'He got out of the car and he was hyper, showing me a gun that has a laser and a machete and knives,' she said. The couple were trying to talk King into giving them cash - an event which wasn't unusual according to Vaillancourt's older sister. They have a daughter together who lives in full custody of her paternal grandmother. Online: In this photograph posted by friends on Facebook they expressed dismay at what had become of the girl they loved, right . Ms King told Salt Lake Tribune that her sister was not without remorse at what had become of her life but couldn't work her way out of the cycle of addiction. 'She would cry, ‘I never pictured my life turning out like this,’' King told the newspaper. According to King, Walker gave Vaillancourt attention and Vaillancourt 'was attached to him at the hip'. She says the pair have been living in and out of motels and were most recently living out of their car. She says the couple told her they needed protection and that's why they had purchased a cache of weapons. 'I know she was a victim, but I felt like I already lost her a long time ago. My heart is absolutely bleeding for Derek Johnson’s family,' King added in the interview. 'I just want them to know I’m sorry'. Crashed: Sgt Johnson drove his car a short distance after being shot, crashing it into a field . Shot dead: A tribute site has been set up to Derek Johnson . 'The streets of Draper City were made safer by Sgt. Derek Johnson who loved his job as a police officer for the Draper City Police Department,' Johnson's family wrote in his obituary. 'Understanding the risk, but wanting to protect he gave his life while on duty Sept. 1, 2013, at the age of 32. 'He was the recipient of many awards, including Life Saving Award, Distinguished Service Award, and was the 2012 Community Policing Officer of the Year.

The San Francisco-based Minerva Project, an ambitious effort to remake the higher education model, announced its tuition plan on Tuesday in hopes of attracting some of the world's most talented and academically competitive students for the class that will enroll in the fall of 2014. Although many details of the new school . are still to be ironed out, students in subsequent years will pay . tuition of $10,000 a year along with about $19,000 annually for room and . board - still well below the cost of many other top U.S. universities . that can run upwards of $50,000 and $60,000 a year.

'Not only are we looking at students who are intellectually brilliant, we are looking for students who have a deep intellectual thought, deep integrative thought, worldliness, excitement about seeing the world, and maturity,' said Minerva founder Ben Nelson, who ran photo service Snapfish until he sold it to Hewlett Packard in 2005. 'We're asking a lot of them,' he said about the first class of students. 'We're asking them not only to be the first students at Minerva, but to help us shape it.' Minerva founder Ben Nelson at the Minerva Project San Francisco headquarters . That will include providing constant feedback, he said in an interview, adding the first class would have between 15 and 19 students. To recruit them, Minerva is working with guidance counselors and high school principals around the world, Nelson said, and several thousand inquiries have come in via its website from 99 countries. Courses at Minerva, named for the Roman goddess of wisdom, will be seminar-oriented, focusing on higher level skills such as logic, reasoning, rhetoric and empirical analysis, Nelson said. Students who need introductory classes such as Economics 101 will be encouraged to find free online lectures. 'Anything that can be delivered in a lecture, we don't think it's particularly moral of us to charge money for,' he said. In a further departure from the traditional educational model, the school's faculty, projected to be experts in their fields from around the world, will not be offered tenure. They will hold classes with the Minerva students online. Students will spend their first year in San Francisco and then rotate to other cities in subsequent years, although the locations have not yet been determined. Minerva is seeking academic accreditation in association with the Keck Graduate Institute, a member of the Claremont University Consortium, according to the school's website, and Nelson said he hoped to have that in hand before the first class is enrolled. To get off the ground, Minerva raised $25m from Benchmark, a top Silicon Valley venture-capital firm, last year. But eventually, Minerva hopes tuition plus fees for room and board will move the for-profit institution into the black. Larry Summers, a former Treasury Secretary and former president of Harvard University, is an adviser to Minerva; former U.S. Senator Bob Kerrey is its executive chairman.

Other groups have adopted the venture-backed model, including Udacity, a service teaching courses in areas such as artificial intelligence and cryptography that was started by a trio of roboticists. Of course, the glean of the Internet does not guarantee success. Many long-standing online colleges mimic the structure, and sometimes approach the cost, of traditional universities. But some have high dropout and low graduation rates, and employers do not always value their degrees.","The San Francisco-based Minerva Project hopes to attract .

Following the end of WWII up to when the wall came down in Berlin, spies in East Germany carried out Cold War espionage from Stasi headquarters outside the capital. The Stasi spies - the German equivalent to the CIA in the U.S, the Soviet Union's KGB and MI6 in the UK - carried out secret missions during the Cold War period and many of the equipment was stored in a building 15 minutes from the German town of Alexanderplatz. Although some of the gadgets were destroyed when the building was taken over following the collapse of the Berlin wall, many remained and are now on display in the Stasimuseum, on the ground of the old headquarters. Stasi spies - the German equivalent to the Soviet Union's KGB - carried out secret missions during the Cold War. Many of the gadgets they used, including this camera and tape recorder, are stored in the secret service's old headquarters near the German town of Alexanderplatz in the east Berlin . The Stasimuseum stores espionage equipment and uniforms dating from 1950 to 1989. The building was stormed in January 1990 by political groups that opposed the East German regime. Many of the spies attempted to hide or destroy all evidence of their espionage, including intelligence, to prevent it getting into the enemies hands . Stasi is an acronym for the Ministerium fuer Staatsicherheit, or Ministry for State Security. The museum showcases the Stasi's various espionage equipment and uniforms dating from 1950 to 1989 and many of the displays are stored in the building where Stasi generals would have worked. The building was stormed in January 1990 by the Citizens' Committees, a political group that opposed the East German regime, along with the Military State . Prosecutor. Many of the spies attempted to hide or destroy all evidence of their espionage, including intelligence, to prevent it getting into enemy hands. The museum is now operated by the Antistalinistische Aktion . Berlin-Normannenstraße (ASTAK), which was founded by civil rights . activists in Berlin during this time. During reconnaissance missions, Stasi agents would hide cameras on their person. Some cameras were concealed in the zips of coats, pictured left, worn by the agents. The hidden shutted was then activated by pressing a silent rubber pump hidden in the pocket of the coat, pictured right . Many of the gadgets were made and used during the 1960s and 1970s and were considered technologically advanced for their time. Some of the cameras used by the Stasi were modified versions of commercial cameras, while other hardware was custom-made, such as this Robot Star camera pictured that was hidden inside the agent's coat . The centre of the exhibition is the office and working quarters of the former Minister of State Security Erich Mielke. Erich Mielke was a German communist politician and secret police official who spent ten years working for Joseph Stalin. After the 1945 Battle of Berlin, Mielke returned to Germany and is said to have played a major role in organising the Soviet Zone into a dictatorship under the Socialist Unity Party. He became head of the Stasi in 1957 until 1989 and once Germany was unified, Mielke was convicted of murdering police officers Paul Anlauf and Franz Lenck. An offence that took place during riots in 1931. As well as his office, which includes the . secretariat and a private living area, offices of his colleagues are also on show at the museum, along with a conference and lunch room. Some of the Stasi's cameras and recording equipment were fitted to less suspicious objects including this tree trunk that could monitor secret and confidential conversations. This item was found on the grounds of the Stasimuseum . Along with tree trunks that could monitor and record conversations from the ground, cameras were fitted to nesting boxes in trees, pictured. These were used to capture the faces of the people having the conversations but could also record incoming vehicles to a property, for example . The German government is thought to have wanted to take over the museum in 2010, which lead to a dispute between ASTAK, local government in the Lichtenberg region where the building is, and the national government. The entire building covers 50 acres of land and at its height, is said to have employed about 8,000 people by 1989. It is believed to have employed around two per cent of members of the German Democratic Republic full-time, and up to a quarter of . all citizens were used as informants at one time or another. In fact, the Stasi is believed to have outnumbered the KGB. Among the surveillance and observation technology on show are concealed cameras, bugs, wires, hidden infrared equipment used to take photos at night, and more. Many of the gadgets were made and used during the 1960s and 1970s and were considered technologically advanced for their time. Cameras and bugs were even fitted to watering cans. This can was portable, meaning it could be left anywhere. Plus, if someone looked into the can they couldn't see the the Robot Star camera because it was hidden in the lid.' Gießkanne mit verborgener fototechnik' literally translates to watering can with hidden camera . In a bid to conceal cameras further towards the end of the 1980s, small bugs around the same size as an AA battery, microphones and cameras were fitted inside the tubes of felt tip pens, pictured. They were either carried in the pockets of agents or left in places where they suspected useful conversations to take place . For example, one Pentacon camera on display had built-in noise reduction and an extended film roll so that it could be used for longer than traditional cameras. These were permanently installed in public places like post offices. Other hidden cameras were disguised inside specially-modified coats. The camera lens was fitted to a zip on the lapel and attached by a wire to a camera hidden in a panel. The spy could trigger the camera by squeezing a small, silent rubber pump in a pocket. On other cameras, the shutter was disguised to look like a button, so the camera was fitted to the inside of the jacket and appeared to be part of the coat. Cameras and recording equipment were also fitted inside ties worn by male secret agents, or inside handbags for female spies. These were controlled by readjusting the tie or squeezing the bag in a certain place using springs. Tiny microphones were also fitted to wristwatches. The wire, pictured, would be concealed by the agent's sleeve and would have been connected to recording equipment either in a pocket or worn on the spy's person . Handbags were also used to conceal portable radios, as well as bugs and other audio recording devices and an infrared camera complete with flash for taking photos at night or in dark room. The Stasi were among the first to add tiny cameras to the insides of felt tip pens. Some of the cameras used by the Stasi were modified versions of commercial cameras, while other hardware was custom-made. Stasi agents additionally installed cameras and recording equipment into nesting boxes, tree trunks and even watering cans to fool people further. Cameras were fitted inside ties worn by male secret agents, left, or inside handbags for female spies. These were controlled by readjusting the tie or squeezing the bag in a certain place using springs. Handbags were also used to conceal portable radios, right, with an infrared camera for taking photos at night or in dark room . According to Ukrainian photographer and Stasi expert Egor Egorov, members of the Stasi were 'masters at . eavesdropping. They had to bug everyone and record everything.' This included installing tiny microphones, no bigger than the size of an AA battery, in wall cavities and inside tubes fitted behind wallpaper. Some of the radio transmitters were able to record and emit at at 940-980 MHz. Many of these rooms included bugged telephone outlets. Egorov continued: 'The Stasi did not need to eavesdrop on the phone conversations this way, because phones conversations were recorded separately in a centralized manner. 'Bugs were intended to hear people's conversations in the room, and phone lines only provided power supply and transferred speech back to the Stasi.' He added that to record a conversation with a suspect, a spy had to use a carry-on bug, which was made up of a separate recording device and a microphone disguised to look like, say, a pen.

With its looming towers and bright lights, London at night already looks like something from a fantasy world. But now the capital could have another addition to its skyline - a skyscraper that wouldn't look out of place in Gotham City. The planned office development, which has also been likened to a giant set of books on a bookshelf and a toast rack, would comprise of 10 'vertical slices' ranging from seven to 34-storeys high in London's financial district. The designs were unveiled today and have taken inspiration from the 'neo-gothic' architecture featured in Tim Burton's Batman and Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight. The planned development is said to be influenced by buildings featured in Tim Burton's Batman . Located in Leadenhall Street in the insurance industry's heartland, it would be 558ft (170 metres) tall at its highest - 10 metres shorter than the nearby Gherkin and would become the capital's 13th highest building. The project is expected to cost about £391million. Developer Henderson Global Investors also said it would consist of 890,000 square feet of offices and 20,000 square feet of shops. Construction is planned to start in 2015 on the condition that it pre-lets 30 per cent of the building, with completion targeted for 2019. Dizzy heights: The new building (centre) would be 558ft tall making it the capital's 13th highest building . Henderson bought the development plot, known as the Leadenhall Triangle, out of administration in 2011 for more than £175million. The value of the building once fully let could be between £800million and £1billion, property experts said. Geoff Harris, Henderson's director of property development, said the building is 'a vote of confidence in the City of London and a major boost to investment, growth and employment in the economy.' It was designed to have a cascading shape so as not to spoil views of St Paul's Cathedral from Fleet Street. Inspiration: The new building wouldn't look out of place in Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight . Henderson's plans come amid a split in the office letting market in London's financial district with developers in the EC3 postcode district having more success among the relatively buoyant insurance industry versus the more broadly weak state of financial services firms and banks further afield. The owners of the nearby Walkie Talkie skyscraper, which attracted headlines this month after sunlight reflected off its glass cladding melting parts of a Jaguar car and even fried an egg on the pavement, said in July they expect the tower to open two-thirds full next year on the back of strong demand from insurers. Many have said the building will liken London to Gotham City featured in Tim Burton's 1989 version of Batman . Outside the insurance industry's heartland, construction on the 100 Bishopsgate tower, owned by Canadian developer Brookfield and the Pinnacle skyscraper, backed by Saudi Arabian investment manager SEDCO, has stalled amid a fruitless search for tenants. Henderson will submit its plans to the City of London on September 23. It hired Ken Shuttlworth's architectural practice Make, the architect behind UBS's headquarters in the City, to design the development.","Designs inspired by 'neo-gothic' architecture featured in Batman film .

Angela Canzani says the drunk driver responsible for her father's death has magnified the trauma of her family's loss by confessing to the crime online in a widely publicized YouTube video . In court: Matthew Cordle, pictured in court on Tuesday, has entered a surprising not guilty plea in his case. Just last week he confessed to a killing in a YouTube video - but a judge said the plea is a courtroom tactic . Defense strategy: Cordle's attorney, Martin Midian (right), said his client would likely plead not guilty at his arraignment, but he still intends to plead guilty at a later date . 'My name is Matthew Cordle, and on . June 22, 2013, I hit and killed Vincent Canzani,' he says. 'This video . will act as my confession.'

He entered a preliminary plea of not guilty . Wednesday in a procedural move that would allow a judge to be appointed . that would accept a guilty plea. Cordle is also charged with a misdemeanor count of operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol. If convicted, he faces up to 8 1/2 years in prison. Angela Canzani has previously spoken out against Cordle, saying the only reason he posted the video is so he could try to get a lighter prison sentence. She said he was ‘totally misleading’ with his confession . because he was already a suspect in the crime. ‘There was a traffic cam. There was a . third car involved,’ Canzani told NBC News. ‘So people are kind of . looking at this like he’s just coming out of nowhere…Like he’s some hero . or something.’ But on Friday, the . ex-wife of Mr Canzani told MailOnline she 'applauded' the decision of .

'I can't bring Mr. Canzani back, and I can't erase what I've . done, but you can still be saved. Your victims can still be saved,' he says. Video confession: The 3.5 minute video starts out with his face blurred and voice altered as he explains how he was driving drunk when he killed someone . Moment of truth: Matthew Cordle identifies himself when the effects are taken away and says that he will plead guilty to any charges that he faces stemming from the June 22 accident . His pledge: Cordle, 22, said that he was fully aware of the legal implications of making the video . Victim: Vincent Canzani was 61 at the time of his death (pictured recently at right) and previously served in the Navy (seen in his uniform in an undated photo at left) Cordle . says in the video he 'made a mistake' when he decided to drive his . truck home after 'drinking heavily' and hit the other car, killing Mr . Canzani, of suburban Columbus. An obituary for Mr Canzani says that he served as a missile technician for a submarine from 1980 to 1986. Since leaving the Navy, he flourished . as 'a gifted photographer' and was survived by two daughters and three . great grandchildren. The video was released in conjunction with a not-for-profit start up called Because I Said I Would, which is focused around having individuals make commitments to themselves and their goals using index cards. A fan: Cleveland kidnap victim Gina DeJesus posed for a picture with the group's shirt after the founder met with her mother . Its website says that it aims to become a 'a social movement dedicated to bettering humanity through the power of a promise'. The organization was founded by Alex Sheen who was inspired by his father, who died of lung cancer last September. At his father's funeral, they handed out promise cards in tribute to how his father always kept his promises. In a message that was posted on the group's website when the confession video was published, Mr Sheen says that Mr Cordle was the one to reach out to him via Facebook message about the hit-and-run. 'After getting to know Matt, I can say with confidence that he truly regrets his decision that night. He describes the guilt he has as “insurmountable,”' Mr Sheen wrote in the post. 'Against all legal advice, Matthew decided to make this video and release it prior to any charges being filed against him. His goal is to raise awareness about the terrible consequences that drunk driving can have on innocent people.' Cordle's confession is not the only high-profile action the group has been involved with. After the three young women were . discovered in Ariel Castro's Cleveland home, Mr Sheen was moved to . launch a ten-day walking campaign across the state in their honor. Movement: The group's founder, Alex Sheen (seen closest to the camera) was inspired to go on a 10-day state-wide walk to raise awareness for sexual abuse victims after DeJesus, Amanda Berry and Michelle Knight were found .

Thousands of students in southern China have been forced to sign a 'suicide waiver' before starting university, it is claimed. More than 5,000 new pupils at the City College of Dongguan University of Technology in China's Guangdong province have been asked to sign a contract absolving the school of responsibility if any of them commit suicide. Officials have claimed the waiver, which also covers self-inflicted injuries, merely serves as a 'warm reminder' of the college's code of conduct, according to Chinese media. But outraged parents have argued the disclaimer - titled the 'student management and self-discipline agreement' - puts an enormous amount of pressure on students. The university, which is situated in Dongguan (pictured) in China's Guangdong province, has sparked outrage among parents after forcing its students to sign 'suicide waivers' Ms Li, whose son just started his first year at the college and who wishes to remain unidentified, told Time: 'I think this kind of agreement is irresponsible and unfair, and I doubt it's going to have any effect on student behaviour. 'The school should provide counselling services and other help for students, instead of trying to absolve themselves of responsibility even before anything has happened.' Many of the parents believe the waiver is a way for the university to shun responsibility. One father - who wishes to remain unnamed - told China Daily he had sent his child to the school because he believed it provided a safe environment for its students. 'The university shouldn't pass the buck when things happen on campus,' he said. A good education has long been seen as the only path to success in China - with schoolchildren facing immense pressure to do well. Officials have claimed the waiver, which also covers self-inflicted injuries, merely serves as a 'warm reminder' of the policy of the university in Dongguan.

Escape: The rabbit's leaping abilities apparently enabled it to avoid a grisly fate . The charming scenes took place at Qingdao Forestry Zoo in Shandong province in northern China. Zookeepers there put the rabbit in with the tiger and leopard cubs when they reached the age of two months. They hoped to test how well developed the big cats' wild instincts were by seeing if they would be able to hunt down the rabbit. However, the intended prey was apparently able to escape the fierce animals' attention. Athletic: The rabbit's canny escape attempt seemed to outpace this leopard on the prowl . Success? One leopard cub got his teeth on the rabbit - but only managed to chomp on its ear . Stand-off: The tiger apparently tried intimidating the rabbit by giving it the hairdryer treatment . The tiny tigers even seemed to shy away from the rabbit, though it was only a quarter of its size. Photographs of the chase show that the worst any of the predators was able to do was to grab hold of one of the rabbit's ears.

Royal romance: The couple, who are now married with a son, didn't first meet at university as previously believed . She said: 'This was really fascinating for me. I was speaking to some of her friends at Marlborough College, which was where she went before St Andrews, and they said, ""Uh uh, she didn't meet him at St Andrews.

Auction: Art enthusiast Andy Fields who bought a picture he claims is an Andy Warhol original for £3 at a jumble sale has put the drawing up for sale for £1.25million . An art enthusiast who bought a £3 sketch from a jumble sale that could be an original by Andy Warhol has put the drawing up for sale on eBay - with a minimum price of £1.25million. Andy Fields, 49, was astonished when experts said that one of a handful of unidentified sketches he picked up at a sale in Las Vegas could be a previously unknown picture by the pop art legend from when he was aged 10 or 11. Although the late 1930s pencil and graphite sketch has been formally valued at £1.3million, Mr Fields says he has been told it could be worth up to ten times that. He says that if it was an original as claimed, the drawing of singer and actor Rudy Vallee would move the birth of Pop Art back almost two decades and show Warhol was already doing it in childhood. The Warhol Authentification Board did not officially approve the sketch as Warhol's work before it disbanded but he claims that experts from Bonhams and Sotheby's believe that it is an original piece by the iconic artist. He says that they are reluctant to speak publicly without authenticity from the Warhol board. Mr Fields, from Tiverton, Devon, said: 'I've had experts from Sotheby's and Bonhams who are convinced it is original, without a shadow of doubt. 'But without an official authentication boards approval they are reluctant to speak publicly. 'I think it is an incredibly important work which redefines the work of one of the most famous artists of the last 100 years. 'When I first found it I sent it to The Andy Warhol Authentication Board who wrote their unique number in the lower left corner. Precious: Mr Fields bought the picture in Las Vegas and claims that more than one expert is convinced that it's an original Warhol . Doubt: Questions have been raised about the authenticity of the 1930s drawing because it is signed Andy Warhol and the artist didn't change his name from Warhola until 1949 . 'They sent it back to me saying they did not have enough evidence to support the fact it could be real. 'I think it's important to note that when they have the slightest doubt about a piece they simply stamp ""denied"" on it in red letters. This was not the case with this picture. 'Since submitting it to the Authentication Board I have done extensive research to prove beyond all reasonable doubt that it is genuine. 'I am just sad that the Board is no longer authenticating works of Warhol.' Mr Fields claims the people who ultimately control the Warhol market are reluctant to re-write history and acknowledge what would be Warhol's earliest-known pop art work. He said: 'These people are so against this particular work being authentic because they simply do not wish to consider changing the facts that have formulated the current version of events Warhol fans have become used to and have no control over a man who has found a lost piece of history.' Expensive: The sketch hasn't had any bids so far on the auction website . Claims: Mr Fields says that if his picture is authentic it will push the birth date of pop art back a couple of decades . But doubts do remain about the work. The piece it is signed 'Andy Warhol' and he only changed his name from Andrew Warhola in 1949. But Mr Fields said he believes it is signed 'Warhol' rather than 'Warhola' because the artist only signed the work many years after he drew it. 'The way the experts have explained it is that Warhol never used to sign his early work,' Mr Fields added. 'When he gave work away many years later it is highly likely he would have been asked to sign it. Legend: Work by Andy Warhol (left) has sold for as much as £65million. His painting Soup Can (Tomato) sold for £5.6million . He added: 'I am happy to be grilled by any expert in the world.' Mr Fields picked up the artwork at a sale of property belonging to a man who told him his aunt had been a friend and carer of the sickly young Warhol. Businessman Mr Fields has put the drawing on eBay with a starting bid of £1.25 million and is inviting serious enquiries only. In October 2008 Warhol's Eight Elvises painting was sold in a private sale for $100 million (£65million) - a record for his work. His painting Soup Can (Tomato) sold for £5.6million two years ago - while Lemon Marilyn fetched £17.5million in 2007.","Andy Fields, 49, bought the sketch from a jumble sale in Las Vegas .

And by that measure Russian President Vladimir Putin has been in power for an eternity. But it seems that an eternity may not be enough for the ex-KGB premier, as he revealed he could run for a fourth presidential term in 2018. Scroll down for video . Putin was first elected in 2000 and served two four year terms until he handed control of the country to puppet president Dmitry Medvedev who served until 2012 when Putin was reelected, this time for a six year term . If reelected the hardline ruler will have been in power for nearly a quarter of a century which will make him the nation's longest-serving leader since Joseph Stalin. Putin, who served two consecutive four-year terms starting in 2000, stepped out of the presidential limelight and became prime minister in 2008 to observe a limit of two consecutive terms. However, he maintained his grip on power from the shadows with his longtime ally, Dmitry Medvedev, serving as a placeholder. During Putin's time in office his image has been carefully controlled leading to several bizarre PR stunts designed to show the leader as powerful and manly, including one in which he claimed to have shot a tiger . Medvedev initiated a law that extended the presidential term to six years, and Putin won a third term 2012, despite major public protests in Moscow against his rule. While a tearful Putin took to a stage in Moscow to deliver his victory speech, allegations of vote rigging circulated with footage emerging of one man feeding voting cards into an automatic voting machine. Putin won 62 per cent of the ballots, while his next closest rival won only 17 per cent. If he wins the next election Putin will have been in power for 24 years, including the time served by stooge leader Dmitry Medvedev (pictured left), the same amount of time as WWII dictator Joseph Stalin (right) Asked Thursday whether he would seek another term in 2018, Putin said that he doesn't exclude the option. If he wins the vote, Putin will have been either in direct or indirect control of Russia for 24 years, assuming he does not run again. Joseph Stalin, Russia's infamous Second World War dictator, became ruler of the nation in 1929 and died in the post 24 years later, in 1953.","Russian President has said that he wouldn't exclude running again .

With her washboard stomach and pert bottom, it's not surprising Louise Hazel is often asked how she gets her enviable figure. Now the Commonwealth champion, who recently announced her retirement from international heptathlon, is letting people in on the secrets of her toned body. She's become a personal trainer and has devised a new workout and nutritional plan, called the Podium Effect, that's designed to help people lose weight and shape up. The plan is based upon the Olympian's own training methods but is aimed at beginners. Enviable figure: Louise Hazel is often asked how she gets her toned abs, now you can find out with her new workout plan . She told MailOnline: 'People always ask me ""how do you get . your arms and your bum like that? And how do you get your abs?"" 'Now I have the opportunity to share the knowledge . and tricks of the trade that made me an elite athlete. Personal trainer in your living room: Louise demonstrates workouts that can be followed in your own home . Simple but effective: Louise said the workouts are high intensity but suitable for beginners . Fight the fat: The plan involves moves and nutritional advice to help people lose weight and tone up . 'The 60 day plan reflects what we do as . athletes as we know what training we have planned for the next four . weeks. I wanted to give the average person access to something like . that. I hope I can be a . role model and give people the information they need to better . themselves.' The Podium Effect is an online programme that people can subscribe to for £9.99 a month. They can then log in to access workout videos demonstrated by Louise and nutritional advice including meal plans. London-born Louise said the workouts are all 'simple but effective' involving moves such as sit ups and burpees that you can do in your own home. Golden girl: The heptathlete came first at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Dehli . Team GB: Louise with fellow heptathletes Katarina Johnson-Thompson, (left) and Jessica Ennis-Hill. She won't carry on training to qualify for Rio 2016 due to a number of factors including lack of financial support . She explained: 'I wanted to make it so people have no . excuse not to exercise. The main excuse for exercising nowadays is ""I . don't have time"" and people can't always afford to join a gym or get a . personal trainer. So I wanted to offer a solution to the average person . to get them into fitness and kick start a new regime. 'People get out of the habit of exercising and I wanted to create . something that takes the stress away. It's effectively a fitness DVD but streamed and available to you wherever you go. The workouts are 45 minutes long including the warm up and down.' Louise developed the nutritional side of the plan with Kim Pearson, who was her nutritionist in the build-up to the London 2012 Olympics. Louise explained: 'It's a low glycaemic, low carb diet and is based on portion sizes not calorie counting. Having to count calories is just tedious and I wanted to create something that's sustainable both in terms of fitness and nutrition. Still training: Although she's retired from the heptathlon, she will keep running and plans to take part in a 10k for the British Heart Foundation . 'Having to monitor every bite you put in your mouth seems ridiculous. You just need to know the nutrients and foods you need to put in your body to stay healthy. That's the information we are providing.' She added: 'Dieting shouldn't be a case of ""today I'm just eating celery"". It should be exciting and people should be able to look at a list of ingredients and create something tasty.' 'Having to monitor every bite you put in . your mouth seems ridiculous. You just need to know the foods you need to stay healthy' The personal trainer said she's seen 'amazing results' with the people she's worked with so far. 'Some lost 5kg in 26 days . and 7cm around the waist,' she said. 'When I put the programme together I knew I needed to create a calorie deficient to ensure users will see results.' Louise's new fitness venture comes as she hangs up her track spikes, retiring from athletics at the relatively young age of 27. She has been competing at international level since the age of 15, excelling at the seven different disciplines of the heptathlon in order to represent her country in the European, World and Commonwealth Championships, as well as the London Olympics. The highlight of her career was a gold medal at the Commonwealth Games in Delhi in 2010. The University of Birmingham graduate admitted some have seen her retirement as premature but she said the time was right to pursue new opportunities due to a number of factors. She said: 'The London Olympics was an incredible time for me and I've had a great career gaining a Commonwealth gold medal. The Rio Olympics is another three years which is a long time to keep training. I wanted to do other things and explore opportunities that could be equally as exciting and rewarding. 'It's a personal decision and injury and illness has come into the equation. They can mean you train hard but still don't fulfil your full potential on the day of competition. Some people have been sad about me retiring but I'm really enjoying it. I've had an amazing opportunity to represent my country and it's opened so many doors for me for which I'm very grateful.' Without bitterness, the heptathlon added that her ability to carry on as a full-time athlete till Rio 2016 was hindered by a lack of support from sport governing bodies and sponsors - as she was dropped from lottery funding and had no kit deal. She said: 'Not having funding made it difficult for me to consider a long term future in the sport. We talk about Olympic legacy but it remains to be seen for those athletes who didn't medal at the London Games. The onus is on us to create our own Olympic legacy. 'There are athletes out there like Greg Rutherford who has said he can't get a kit contract. That's a basic you'd expect for someone who has achieved an Olympic gold medal. 'It's no surprise for me that there's a struggle for funding in sport and I didn't want that to be an on-going battle for another four years.' She added: 'It's difficult to keep going when you don't have a means to stay on track. The heptathlon means training for seven events so it's more than a full-time job. You have to be at the track five hours a day. I would train twice a day, six times a week. 'If you can only fund that by getting a part-time job then you have to ask what you can achieve when you can only give it half your time. I had to be realistic.' On the plus side of retirement, Louise said she's grateful she no longer has to run painful lactic acid inducing 800m races. But she doesn't want to stop running altogether so she's signed up for a new challenge - the Blenheim Palace 10k run on Sunday 6th October. She'll be taking part as an ambassador for the British Heart Foundation - a cause that resonates with her as she lost her father to heart disease in 2008. She said: 'He had a heart attack and a stroke and spent six weeks in hospital before he passed away. It was tragic as he never got to see me compete in the Olympic Games. So I want to help give people information about how to have a healthy lifestyle and a healthy heart.'

With their ridiculous fur hats, conspicuous sunglasses, absurd facial hair and awkward catalogue poses, you'd be forgiven for laughing at these cringe-worthy retro pictures. But the reality behind the images is horrifying. These are agents of the dreaded Stasi, East Germany's startlingly effective secret police that turned the Communist country into a paranoid dystopia. The pictures show how agents dressed in an effort to remain inconspicuous as they attempted to invade the privacy of suspected dissenters and gather evidence, before ruthlessly interrogating them - often for days on end. The banality of evil: Two of the outfits agents of the Stasi would have employed as they went about their repressive work. Ironically, the outfit on the right makes the agent look like a stereotypical movie spy . They were also a photographic record of how their agents would have dressed when undertaking Cold War missions to the hated West. Some of the disguises seem laughable to us now. One of the images, featured on Foreign Policy, shows a stereotypical tourist disguise laden with cameras, shades, a hat and garish red trousers. Another shows what could be a student, complete with cut-off jean shorts and a backpack. The Stasi fashion collection was . extensive. The agency sent thousands of spies into West Germany and had . access to vast amounts of cash to buy western goods to equip agents with. Blending in? The extraordinary images form part of the Stasi secret police course on the 'art of disguising' While the pictures are amusing, the sinister purpose of the disguises should be considered . The extent of Stasi snooping is seen in other photos in the book. They include snapshots agents took of houses before they were to be searched for contraband or material 'harmful to the state.' The Stasi always took photos of rooms they ransacked so they could put everything back in its place and the victims would not know they had been to visit them. The photos were found in the miles and miles of paperwork found in Stasi offices across East Germany that the agency's shredders and furnaces did not have time to destroy in the hours and days following the collapse of the regime in 1990. German artist Simon Menner spent two years poring over materials from the archive of the Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Archives of the German Democratic Republic for his forthcoming book Top Secret: Images from the Stasi Archives. This range of casual decor was likely employed on a mission to the democratic, capitalist West . The photos were found in the miles and miles of paperwork found in Stasi offices across East Germany . The artist amassed the images over a period of two years. He pored over materials from the archive of the Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Archives of the German Democratic Republic . He says he aims to show 'the act of surveillance from the perspective of the surveillant'. 'Many of the images reproduced here might appear absurd or even funny to us,' he said. 'But it is important not to lose sight of the original intentions behind these pictures. They concern photographic records of the repression exerted by the state to subdue it own citizens. 'For me, the banality of some of these pictures makes them even more repulsive.' To see more of Mr Menners work, take a look at his website simonmenner.com . The former East German secret police 'Stasi' headquarters in Berlin . The German Democratic Republic’s Ministry for State Security (Stasi) was one of the most effective surveillance apparatuses ever. Proportionally to the size of its population, the East German Stasi had far more agents working for it than the KGB or the CIA. The Stasi turned one in three of the 17 million people of the German Democratic Republic into an informant. Children sneaked on their parents at school, wives informed on husbands, lovers betrayed one another. Additionally, Stasi agents infiltrated and undermined West Germany's government and spy agencies. The Stasi often broke the will of the victim by targeting their private or family life. This often included breaking into homes and messing with the contents smear campaigns, denunciation, provocation, psychological warfare, psychological subversion, wiretapping, bugging, mysterious phone calls or unnecessary deliveries. Usually victims had no idea the Stasi were responsible and some suffered mental breakdowns or even committed suicide. The Stasi employed one full-time agent for every 166 East Germans. The Stasi had one informer per 6.5 people. By comparison, the Gestapo employed one secret policeman per 2,000 people. When East Germany collapsed in 1989, the Stasi had 102,000 employees.","Ridiculous pictures hide a dark and terrifying reality .

Tragic: Drake Smith Jr, four, who died after he . was nfected by the Naegleria fowleri microbe while playing on a . waterslide at a home in Louisiana . A rare brain-eating amoeba that killed a four-year-old in Louisiana may be on the rise as a result of Hurricane Katrina, experts have said. Drake Smith Jr, from Mississipi, is believed to have been infected by the Naegleria fowleri microbe while playing on a Slip'N'Slide toy at a home in St Bernard Parish. Tissue tests by the Centers for Disease Control later revealed he died from a form of encephalitis after the amoeba entered his body through his nose and attacked his brain. Experts say the N. fowleri amoeba is . spreading through the area's water supply because a drastic drop in . population following Hurricane Katrina has left much of its water . stagnant. Just south-west . of New Orleans, St Bernard Parish was one of the areas most badly . affected by the hurricane which smashed the U.S. Gulf coast eight years . ago. Jake Causey, . chief engineer for Louisiana's health and hospitals, told CNN: 'One of . the concerns is that it was such a drastic population drop after Katrina . and the water aged ... just by sitting in the pipes and also a drop in . lower demand.

State epidemiologist Dr Raoult Ratard . earlier this week told Reuters that Naegleria fowleri infections are . rare, though the amoeba itself is not. Studies . have shown that the amoeba exists 'in very low numbers' in about 40 per . cent of water supplies in the developed world, he said. He . said the amoeba likely multiplied in the St. Bernard water system . because the chlorine level in some locations fell below the 0.5 . milligrams per liter standard by the CDC. Dr . Peralta said that St Bernard Parish is continuing to flush its water . system and add chlorine to ensure that the water is safe for drinking . and bathing.

The North Carolina father who was working in a two-story-deep dirt hole that collapsed and killed his daughter and her cousin was charged today with two counts of involuntary manslaughter. Lincoln County Sheriff David Carpenter said Jordan Arwood, 31, was charged following a lengthy investigation. 'This has been a very tragic event and we continue to pray for all persons involved with this as our investigation is turned over to the courts,' he said. Tragedy: Jordan Arwood is seen here with his 6-year-old daughter Chloe Jade Arwood who was killed in April along with her 7-year-old cousin . Recovered: The bodies of Chloe, left, and James Levi Caldwell, right, were found under about 24 feet of dirt in an excavated site in April . At the request of the district attorney, Carpenter said he wouldn't make any additional statements about the case. Arwood was being held in the county jail on $15,000 bond. Arwood . was operating a backhoe in a pit in April when the walls caved in on . the children in the small town of Stanley, which is about 20 miles . northwest of Charlotte. The bodies of six-year-old Chloe Jade Arwood and seven-year-old James Levi Caldwell were dug out the next day. While investigating, sheriff's deputies removed guns and a marijuana plant from Arwood's home. After the accident, Arwood was charged with possession of a gun by a felon and making a controlled substance. Officials described the pit as 20 feet by 20 feet with a sloped entrance leading down to the bottom. The children were at the bottom of the construction site retrieving a child-sized pickaxe when the walls fell in on them. Covered: The pit, said to have been 20-by-20 feet, is seen following a 13-hour search for two young cousins . Buried: Authorities say the children were found under about 24 feet of dirt in this former excavated site near the Lucia community . Curiosity: Chloe Jade Arwood, seen holding a bird at their home last spring, was said to sometimes try to sneak into her father's construction site and try to help without warning . No permits had been issued for Arwood to dig on the site. In . an interview with The Associated Press a few days after the accident, . Arwood said he worked frantically to save the children but they were . just outside his reach. He says he dug faster and faster trying to save the children until he couldn't breathe. Investigators say they still don't know why Arwood was digging the hole. But he said he was building a rammed earth home, an ancient building method where dirt is used to shape the foundation. Arwood said he had been digging the hole for three months. 'I just wanted for her to be warm. I . just wanted to put my arms around her and tell her she would be . safe....I promised her I'd keep her safe. I promised them I'd keep them . safe and warm. I broke that promise.' Arwood . is the girl's father. His parents, Nancy and Ken Caldwell, had adopted . the boy, his twin sister Jazmin and 9-year-old brother Josiah. Arwood . lives next to his parents and the pit was on his property. 'When the wall came down, I kept grabbing . what was in front of me — grabbing enough dirt, grabbing boulders. ... I . wasn't going to stop until I pulled them out. But I couldn't save . them,' he said, sobbing. He paused for a moment. 'I wish it was me,' he said. Support: Members of the Adventure in Faith Church in Alexis, North Carolina, pray for the family of the two young children in April . Relief: Darrell Buchanan, whose wife is related to the family of the two young children, prays with members of the Adventure in Faith Church in Alexis, North Carolina in April . Arwood . said he never allowed the children in the construction site. But they . were children who loved to play in a big backyard, and sometimes they . would sneak in and try to help without warning. But when he spotted . them, Arwood said he would immediately kick them out. As . the walls fell in, he recalled, the children were running to get away. He was within inches of grabbing his daughter's hand. But she . disappeared under a surge of dirt. Now he's haunted by the memories. 'I want to wake up. I just want to wake up,' he said.Recalling the children, his eyes brighten. They were always running around together — the best of friends.

He has a broken femur from a car accident, and has spent a lot of time at home in the last two years raising Chloe, James and their siblings. He taught his daughter and James how to ride four-wheelers in the backyard. He taught Chloe how to hunt. 'This was one side of Chloe: hunting with daddy. She begged me every day afterschool and put on coffee at 4 a.m. to hunt before school.

Well maybe if it came complete with a hot date to sweeten the deal. That's exactly the kind of once-in-a-lifetime deal one man offered on the Gainesville, Florida Craigslist, when he gave readers the chance to take his step-daughter to see the Tennessee Volunteers. Gary Yates explained that 27-year-old Jessica Flanagan's date had suddenly backed out of their arrangement to go the Volunteers' forthcoming September 21 away clash with the Florida Gators. Free ticket! The advert posted by Gary Yates on the Gainesville, Florida Craigslist personals site soliciting a date to accompany his 27-year-old step-daughter Jessica Flanagan to a college football game this Saturday . But instead of swallowing the $150 loss he posted her pictures to the notorious personal ads site in the hope of finding an eligible gentleman to accompany her. The advert, decorated with pictures of the attractive young woman, read: 'My step-daughter's date backed out (his loss, your gain) for the game... 'Free ticket for the Tennessee-Florida Football game this Saturday (cost to me, $150) on the 40 for the right gentleman. You must be an attractive, professional, single well educated gentleman, with a good sense of humor, 25-33. You also must not be threatened by an attractive, professional, single well educated lady, (as she is). If you do not qualify, please pass this ad to a friend. 'The fine print: I lied! (Sorry...not totally free). Your cost will be a modest dinner, drinks and delightful conversation with her before or after the game.' With its reputation for serial killers and prostitution, many parents would perhaps be nervous at the thought of sending their child off with an unknown person solicited from Craiglist. But what the advert did not reveal was that the date would be fully chaperoned. Mr Yates told Fox Sports that he and his wife Brenda are also flying down for the game on Saturday. The chosen one will sit with them and Miss Flanagan at the game. Chaperoned: Mr Yeats's advert did not reveal that he and his wife would also be travelling with Miss Flanagan to the Ben Hill Griffin Stadium in Florida to watch the Volunteers take on the Gators this Saturday . The lifelong Volunteers fan said his inbox had been inundated with offers since the ad - now removed - was posted on Monday night. 'I've had a couple of lighthearted responses, one of them was hilarious, but yeah, it's been mostly serious responses — I would guess, I don't know, 30 or 40,' he said. And he added that he had run the idea by Miss Flanagan before posting the advert and she would have the final say over who would be invited. 'I wouldn't do something like that without her permission,' he said.","Gary Yates offered ticket to take Jessica Flanagan after her date pulled out .

From the battlefield he penned a letter, sweetly telling the little girl how much he loved her and longed to see her. But he never made it home, and the letter and his Purple Heart medal ended up in a box thousands of miles away from Peggy Smith, the daughter who was told nearly nothing about him. Years after a Missouri woman found the box of mementos and underwent an exhaustive search to find the daughter who grew up hesitant to ask about her father because it upset her mother, the letter and medal will be handed over to Smith on Saturday in what figures to be an emotional ceremony in Dayton, Nev., where Smith lives. Peggy and Kevin Smith of Dayton, Nevada, are pictured. Peggy was four months old when her father, Pfc. John Eddington, was killed in action in World War II. Seven decades later Peggy Smith is about to get his Purple Heart medal and an emotional letter the father she never met wrote just weeks after her birth . It was 14 years ago that Donna Gregory was helping her then-husband clean out his grandparents' home in Arnold, Mo., a St. Louis suburb. Gregory stumbled upon a cardboard box filled with World War II memorabilia related to Eddington, though no one knows why. Eddington was from Leadwood, Mo., about 75 miles southwest of St. Louis. Neither Gregory nor Smith know what connection the Arnold couple had to Eddington. Gregory sorted through several letters, including the War Department's message to Eddington's mother about his death in Italy in June 1944, four months after his daughter's birth. At the bottom of the box she found the Purple Heart, the medal awarded to members of the Armed Forces wounded or killed in action. Gregory, of St. Louis, then spent the next 14 years in libraries and on the Internet trying to track down the elusive daughter. She called every Eddington in Missouri, trying to find the right Peggy. No one could help. Earlier this year she enlisted the help . of friends and began reaching out on Facebook, leading to a breakthrough . -- she found Peggy Smith. Pfc. John Farrell Eddington and his wife, Helen, are pictured on their wedding day . Nearly 2,000 miles from St. Louis, Smith said she knew her father died in the war, and knew he earned the Purple Heart. But she didn't know what happened to it. Smith figured her mother had lost the medal or given it away -- until Gregory called. 'It was an unforgettable moment,' Gregory said. Smith said she was 'stunned.' Gregory was touched by the medal, and especially moved by the letter in the box penned by Eddington to his newborn daughter. She declined to quote directly from it, saying Smith should read it first. 'It's basically a soldier who is pouring out his heart on paper to his daughter,' Gregory, 46, said of the letter. 'It's a letter written so she would know how much her daddy loved her.' Beyond his death in war, Smith knew . little about her father since her heartbroken mother could rarely bring . herself to discuss the lost love of her life. 'My . mom didn't tell me much about my dad,' Smith said. 'I think she was . just distraught. She was so much in love with him. I learned as a young . girl not to bring it up because she would just get so upset.' This is the Purple Heart medal awarded to Pfc. John Farrell Eddington who was killed in action in Italy during World War II . This photo shows the back side of the Purple Heart medal awarded to Pfc. John Farrell Eddington . Smith, 69, grew up in St. Louis and lived there until her mid-20s. By then she was a mother of four young children, but in what she described as an unhealthy marriage. She divorced and moved the kids west for a new life in Nevada. She spent several years working as an accountant for the state of Nevada, and remarried in 1997. She has since retired from the state job and works at a Wal-Mart store. Gregory, also an accountant, decided to make the drive to Dayton, near Carson City, to deliver the memorabilia to Smith. She figured it deserved a little more pomp and circumstance. So Gregory wrote a letter to the . Patriot Guard Riders, the volunteer organization perhaps best known for . patrolling funerals of soldiers to shield relatives from protesters from . Westboro Baptist Church, the Topeka, Kan.-based church whose members . believe soldier deaths are God's retribution for America's tolerance of . homosexuality. In the letter, Gregory said she thought it would add meaning if veterans presented the medal to Smith. Before . dawn on Tuesday, Gregory, her sister and a friend left St. Louis in an . SUV, accompanied by about a dozen motorcyclists with the Nevada unit of . the Patriot Guard. Along the route, different groups of riders are . taking turns accompanying Gregory. This was Pfc. John Farrell Eddington's obituary. Seven decades after the Missouri soldier died in World War II, Peggy Smith, the daughter he never met is about to get his Purple Heart medal, along with the emotional letter her father wrote just weeks after her birth . On Saturday, a parade will begin in Carson City and make the 15-mile trek to Dayton, where Smith will be presented the medal and letter in a ceremony at the high school. Smith's children and most of her 11 grandchildren and five great-grandchildren will be there, though she's a bit embarrassed by all the hoopla. 'I'm not a big shindig person,' Smith said. Still, she is bracing for the wave of emotions as she reads the letter for the first time and holds that medal in her hands. 'I'll be crying the whole time,' Smith said. Gregory knows she'll be emotional, too. 'I've cherished all of this for a very long time,' Gregory said. 'I've waited for the finale of this journey for over a decade.'","Pfc.

But the father of a boy with a big imagination has taken the surreal ideas one step further and meticulously recorded his son's fantastic imagination in a photographic project that has taken him six years. From a UFO hovering over a church, to dinosaurs roaming the countryside, David Niles, 60, has recreated his son Nate's nocturnal meanderings using a range of clever photography tricks and software. Nighttime adventures: Three tyrannosaurus rex heads tower over Nate, here in the foreground . Extraterrestrial: Three UFOs hover above the earth and Nate looks on as one lights up the church .

Amphibious: A pod of dinosaurs appear close to the shore, one of which has collected a boat on its head . Low and behold: This is how a herd of flying cows appeared to Nate in one of his dreams one night . Mr Niles, of Paxton in Massachusetts, created the set of photographs after his 10-year-old son told him about the adventures he had been having while asleep at night. Their conversations marked the start of the six-year project, which began when Nate was just four years old. Mr Niles said:'I wanted to put my son into his own imaginary world. 'I began putting them together when Nate was four after I was inspired when I watched him playing with his toys, and so the photos are a combination of those two things.

'Although Nate hasn't had any direct input into the images, the conversations we've had have contributed to them. 'Often he's imagined fantastic things or described a world he was imagining, such as seeing himself as an octopus or pretending to be a tornado. 'I think that it is important to be able to have an imagination at any age, and I tried to get this across by combining my own ideas as well as Nate's.' Mr Niles took time to ensure he got the dreams just right, by also using some of the qualities he saw in 19th century photography. He added:: 'The images were all created with a digital camera, Photoshop, and a little imagination. 'I tend to get a very positive reaction to the photographs. People seem to really enjoy the imaginary quality of the images.' Flee: Nate turns and runs as the herd of giant wooly mammoths appear in the distance .

Making her point: Dilma Rousseff says she is not convinced America wasn't prying into the communications of Brazilian citizens . Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff has called off plans for a state visit to Washington in October because of revelations that the United States spied on her personal communications and those of other Brazilians. Rousseff's decision, which came despite a 20-minute telephone call from President Barack Obama on Monday night in an attempt to salvage the trip, is a big blow to relations between the two biggest economies in the Americas. Both the White House and Rousseff's office billed the decision as a mutually agreed postponement, and said a state visit could take place at an unspecified later date. However, two officials with knowledge of Rousseff's decision said such a visit was unlikely to happen any time soon. White House spokesman Jay Carney said the presidents agreed on the phone the disclosures of alleged U.S. intelligence activities could overshadow their meeting so they decided it would be best to postpone. But U.S. moves to address the surveillance complaints may take months. 'As the President previously stated, he has directed a broad review of U.S. intelligence posture, but the process will take several months to complete,' Carney said. Ties between Brazil and the United States had been improving steadily since Rousseff took office in 2011 and before the revelations that the U.S. National Security Agency had snooped on emails, text messages and calls between the president and her aides. The spying revelations came from documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. 'Illegal surveillance practices intercepting the communication and data of citizens, companies and members of the Brazilian government constitute a serious affront to national sovereignty and individual rights, and are incompatible with democratic cooperation between friendly nations,' the Brazilian government said in a statement. The diplomatic fallout is the latest damage to hit the White House since revelations made by former CIA employee Edward Snowden . In the absence of explanations and a 'commitment to cease such surveillance activities, the conditions are not in place for the visit to go ahead as previously scheduled,' it said. U.S. officials said the NSA surveillance was aimed at tracking suspected terrorist activity and did not pry into personal communications, but Rousseff was not convinced. The trip was expected to be a platform for deals on oil exploration and biofuels technology, and Brazil's potential purchase of fighter jets from Chicago-based Boeing Co. A defense contract worth more than $4 billion that Boeing is seeking for the sale of 36 F-18 fighter jets to the Brazilian Air Force could be the main victim of the spying affair. Brazilian officials have said Brazil cannot buy such strategic aircraft from a country it cannot trust. The spying revelations sparked a political uproar in Brazil that Rousseff could not ignore. A senior government official told Reuters that Rousseff's top advisers, including her mentor and predecessor as president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, encouraged her to scrap the state visit. President Barack Obama spent 20 minutes trying to convince Dilma Rousseff to go ahead with her trip . The issue is not likely to go away soon in a country that has long harbored suspicions that the United States wants to control its rich mineral resources in the Amazon basin and off its Atlantic coast, where Brazil has made the world's largest oil deep-water discoveries in decades. Brazil's Congress has opened an investigation and on Tuesday questioned oil industry regulator Magda Chambriard on whether NSA spying could have given U.S. companies the edge in bidding for offshore production rights to be auctioned next month. The committee also wants to send members to Moscow to interview Snowden, who has been granted temporary asylum by Russia. The decision to cancel the visit to Washington will add tensions to the U.S.-Brazilian relations and increase risks for U.S. companies operating in sensitive sectors in Brazil, the Eurasia consultancy in Washington said in a note to clients. This mainly affects the defense, telecom and energy sectors, and Boeing's chances of securing the jet fighter contract will be 'significantly reduced,' Eurasia's analysts said. 'In the energy sector, there will certainly be a political firestorm if an American company wins the (subsalt) bid round in October,' Eurasia said, referring to the deep sea oil deposits that sit beneath a thick layer of salt under the ocean floor.","Barack Obama spent 20 minutes trying to change her mind during phone call .

Nevertheless, Manchester United manager Ferguson was in bullish mood yesterday as he presented  a rather passionate version of  his current relationship with the centre forward. ‘There’s absolutely no issue between Wayne Rooney and me,’ he said. ‘There is absolutely no problem. Happy camper: Wayne Rooney appeared in good spirits as the Manchester United squad were put through their paces on Friday ahead of this weekend's FA Cup clash against Chelsea . Hands up: Nani, who was sent off against Real Madrid, seemed content in training at Carrington on Friday . ‘He will be here next year, you have . my word on that. There are no issues at all with the player. He’ll  be . involved on Sunday (against  Chelsea in the FA Cup quarter-final), no . doubt about that.’ Ferguson, of course, was talking in . the wake of his decision to leave Rooney out of the team that lost — . rather unluckily — to Real Madrid in the Champions League at Old . Trafford on Tuesday night. More specifically, he was responding to . subsequent reports that the  27-year-old may be sold this summer. At the end of a week in which . Ferguson has gone through the emotional wringer — he was too . ‘distraught’ to talk after the Real defeat — it certainly appeared that . his blood was still up. In good spirits: Nemanja Vidic, Ryan Giggs and Rooney share a joke during training and Ashley Young (below) Facing the media: Sir Alex Ferguson hit back at suggestions Wayne Rooney would be ditched in the summer . Benched: Wayne Rooney was unceremoniously axed for the visit of Real Madrid on Tuesday night . ‘To suggest we don’t talk on the . training ground is absolute  nonsense,’ said Ferguson, even though . nobody had actually suggested that. ‘Wayne understood the reasons for not . playing him were completely tactical and I think we were right. He . understood exactly what we were doing. I explained it to him before we . announced the team and he was fine. ‘You don’t always get it right but I think we got it right. Taking his seat: Ferguson expressed concerns about Turkish referee Cuneyt Cakir prior to Tuesday's game . All smiles: Rooney appeared in good spirits yesterday despite being omitted from United's startling line-up . ‘Danny Welbeck is the best player we . have in terms of operating in a double role. We had to stop Xabi . Alonso’s ability to control the game, which we did, and it took away his . control of the match and ability to go further forward and be an . attacking player. ‘You don’t always get it right but we definitely did on Tuesday.’ Rooney can expect to start  United’s . next big game, against Chelsea tomorrow. Now that talk of a rather . unrealistic treble has gone, a Premier League and FA Cup  double remains . as a tantalising consolation. On the ball: Ferguson opted for Danny Welbeck ahead of Rooney for Tuesday night's tie . As reported in Sportsmail this week, . Ferguson has harboured  concerns over Rooney’s fitness but will hope he . can continue what has been a pretty good scoring run between now and the . end of the season. ‘He does need a lot of football,’ said Ferguson once again. ‘He’s always been that type and it’s always been the case. ‘There are a lot of things you can do . when you lose a game. Certainly we won’t give in, we will get off our . backsides and be ready for Sunday.’ Across Manchester, Roberto Mancini weighed into the issue, saying he too couldn’t see Rooney leaving. ‘I think that Rooney is one of the . best strikers in Europe but I think it is difficult he can leave . United,’ said the Italian, whose side showed an interest in the England . man two years ago. ‘It was always my opinion. Like two . years ago when there was a chance he would leave because I think he’s an . important player for United.’ For Ferguson, focus now shifts to Chelsea. ‘A big game is the best. We’re at home and with a home draw in the FA Cup we’ll play anyone. ‘Chelsea have a terrific cup record . themselves, the best in the last decade, and we haven’t won it for nine . years so there are a lot of incentives for us. Ferguson will face off against former Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez on Sunday . ‘Rio Ferdinand hasn’t got a medal, . for  example, so that’s another great incentive for us.’ It is hard to . look back on Tuesday’s defeat without giving some consideration to the . performance of Turkish referee Cuneyt Cakir, who sent off United winger . Nani with Ferguson’s team a goal up before the hour mark. Certainly the United manager does not seem ready to forgive just yet. Blow: Ferguson confirmed Phil Jones was still not fit enough to return after an ankle injury . ‘On the issue of the referee, quite . simply it’s hard to keep your faith in the game,’ he said. ‘It’s the . third time we’ve been knocked out by a referee’s decision. ‘I was definitely concerned before the game. I said that to the staff but it’s gone. There’s nothing we can do about it. ‘It’s not easy to take but, in the . cold analysis of the day, you realise we’re Manchester United and we . just have to get on with it. Nothing can be done now and the important . issue is Sunday. ‘It’s clear in my mind now and we have . to get on with it. It’s another day in the history of our club. Not a . good day but another day. Dismissed: Nani was shown a controversial red card in Manchester United's defeat by Real Madrid . One might think Manchester United fans would be calmed by their manager's words on Wayne Rooney on Friday morning. However, a glance at the history books shows it’s not the first time Sir Alex Ferguson has tried to flatten a story about one of the clubs stars after which the player is sent on his merry way anyway. After sensationally dropping David Beckham from a crucial Champions League 2nd leg against Real Madrid, Ferguson went on to say: 'I saw it as quite a straightforward decision. Solskjaer's form has been fantastic on the right hand side. He's impressed greatly. There are only so many times you can hit a guy over the head. 'When someone plays as well as he's been playing, what do you do? Leave him out because David Beckham's a great player, too?’ That was on April 23. When asked if he would sell Beckham, Ferguson responded: 'It is totally out of the question. There is no way we would sell him, or any of our best players.' Beckham was sold that very July. Watching brief: David Beckham was left out of United's Champions League match with Real Madrid in 2003 . Sound familiar? It then happened again when the Scot left out Ruud Van Nistelrooy out of United’s biggest game of the season, the 2006 League Cup Final. On dropping the Dutchman on February 26, 2006, Ferguson said: 'I think Louis [Saha] deserved to play.  He had scored five goals in the previous games and, since he’s been fit, I think he’s scored 10 in 13 games. I think there’s a danger you can sometimes overlook it and not give him the credit, but today he deserved to play in the final. 'Ruud seemed to be okay in the dressing room and okay with the players. He will be disappointed, you have to be disappointed. I have had that disappointment myself, being dropped in a cup final, at 10 past two, when you are the top goalscorer. 'It happens and it’s a horrible life that way. Finals are terrible to pull players out and to only have five substitutes, I think it’s wrong.' Also pressed on whether the striker had a future with the club, Ferguson stated: ‘Of course, He’s a member of our squad, no question. He’s on a long contract and we’re very happy with that situation. He has been patient and he’s never complained.. Three months late, in July of that year, Van Nistelrooy was sold. So United fans, if history tells us anything, then Rooney may be facing the exit this summer after all, whatever Sir Alex is trying to make you believe.

PPQ might have made headlines with their red carpet frocks on day one but day two of London Fashion Week proved to be one of the best yet, with Julien Macdonald, Zoe Jordan J.W Anderson and David Koma among the highlights. Koma, although still in love with architectural sihouettes, toned down his fiercely futuristic aesthetic, adding pale blush pink and bold blue to his palette and combining oriental influences with Riviera stripes. The result was tough chic with an infusion of elegance - a combination particularly noticeable in his dresses, which he continues to do brilliantly well. Scroll down for video . Elegant: David Koma toned down his fierce aesthetic in favour of a collection that combined oriental delicacy with bold Riviera blue and feminine blush pink . Pretty: A sculptural cornflower blue and white creation by David Koma . Colour of the season? Blush pink was a popular choice for designers - including Koma . Riviera: Koma's sculptural aesthetic was lent elegance by cool cobalt stripes . Another to unveil a collection crammed with stunning gowns was John Rocha whose beautifully romantic collection bloomed with roses, most of which were splashed across delicate chiffon gowns. Others appeared in white, blush and black, all high necked and demure although there were a number of sheer efforts that gently subverted Rocha's ladylike look. Like his daughter Simone, Rocha has an instinct for making women look beautiful and the1950s glamazons that stalked his catwalk in puffed A-line skirts and elegant picture hats most certainly did. Yet more striking gowns were to be seen at Mark Fast who sent models down the runway in knitted Missoni style gowns and long flowing skirts. But it wasn't all good news. Fast it seems has no intention of letting last summer's crop top trend go quietly and sent several versions down the catwalk - all of which ended well above the belly button - and like the rest of the collection, came in a choice of acid yellow or grey. Elegant: John Rocha's ladylike vision for next summer included the liberal use of blowsy cabbage rose print and some coolly pretty gowns in white organza . Vampy: Black lace and chiffon gowns were accessorised with retro picture hats . Stunning: A delicate white chiffon dress was lifted with artful embroidery at John Rocha . Spectacular: A stunning embroidered 1950s style gown from John Rocha . Yellow fever: Grey and acid yellow dominated at knitwear specialist Mark Fast who also appeared to be on a one man mission to keep last summer's crop top trend alive . Although Fast restricted himself to a minimal palette, Ashish, as is his wont, did not. There were sequins, stripes and plenty of slogans as well as some unusual regal headwear which clashed merrily with the sporty feel of the rest of the collection and the bizarre supermarket bags carried by models. Trousers were baggy and ripped, while the sequinned and sloganed vests betrayed a hint of American style ghetto fabulous. Best of all though, were the dresses which were short and sweet and bound to be everywhere come next summer. Another to focus on dresses for summer was Henry Holland who showed one of his best collections to date in front of a crowd that included One Direction singer Harry Styles and Kelly Osbourne. Gone were the pop art prints of seasons past and in their place delicate, accomplished florals including one especially lovely example that combined watercolour blooms with bold thorn-meshed hearts. Holland's tailoring, not always his strong point, has become a highlight with neatly cropped trousers and perfectly cut shirts in bright blue check among the best in show. Carrier bag chic? Ashish accessorised his collection with bizarre designer shopping bags but produced some incredibly pretty pieces, including this dress (above) Accomplished: Henry Holland showed off his mastery of print with this stunning dress . Highlight: Holland's excellent tailoring has become one of his strengths . Bright spark: As is his wont, Holland's collection included a rainbow of eye-catching hues . Pretty: Irish designer Orla Kiely unveiled a typically feminine collection replete with puffed skirts and demure details, although her trademark prints were largely absent . Elsewhere, Orla Kiely showed a typically sweet collection of neat separates and demure dresses, lifted with girlishly large pockets, although without the colourful prints that made her name. Another to impress was newcomer Zeynep Tosun who showed a well thought out collection of cleverly cut dresses in delicate silver silk and striking baroque black. Equally impressive was fellow fresh face Lug Von Siga whose collection had a jungle feel thanks to liberal use of zebra print and some well-executed tribal totem print. New generation: Zeynep Tosun showed off clever cutting skills with this stunning silver silk gown while Lug Von Siga revealed a keen eye for print (above) The FROW: Eliza Doolittle, Ellie Goulding, Nicola Roberts, Harry Styles and Nick Grimshaw all appeared to enjoy the House of Holland show . Glamorous gathering: Abbey Clancey joined actress Anna Kendrick, singer Paloma Faith and fellow warbler Eliza Doolittle front row at Julien Macdonald . London Fashion Week has long been a must-do on the celebrity circuit and this season's shows have proved no exception. Among the most popular was House of Holland, where designer Henry took a bow in front of a crowd that included One Direction singer Harry Styles, Kelly Osbourne, Alexa Chung and Pixie Geldof. But true to form, the One Direction star couldn't resist a chuckle as he sat in the front row alongside his friend, Radio One DJ, Nick Grimshaw. Earlier in the day, singer Eliza Doolittle joined model Abbey Clancey and actress Anna Kendrick for Julien Macdonald's ultra-glamorous show. The trio sat together as gown after sparkling gown swept past, with Abbey later declaring that she had her eye on one of the few black numbers on show. Other celebrities to make London Fashion Week part of their weekend included Jameela Jamil, the Sugababes and TV presenter Laura Whitmore. Nails were created by Shereen Gayle for Essie. Speaking about the look, she said: ‘We wanted to use more than one nail colour this season, so we choose three. ‘Rather than pairing the floral dresses in the show with something really obvious and feminine we went for a nude called Sand Tropez. Nudes are going to be big next season. 'Everyone’s bored of bold colours now. We’ve done the whole nail art craze and now things have come full circle back to neutrals. ‘We teamed the black dresses with an ivory colour called Merino Cool and a brown shade called Wicked. 'Both are classic and perfectly complement the black looks.’ Ashish's collection was inspired by the idea of a glamorous walk of shame, which was mirrored in the makeup and nails. Sharon Dowsett created the beauty look using Maybelline. Eyeliner (Maybelline Master Drama Kohl) was grungy and starting to smudge and eyes were brightened with gold eyeshadow (Master Duo Eyeliner) that had dropped onto the cheeks. Maybelline Colour Tattoo in Gold Leaf (tipped to be a big seller this season) was pressed onto the top of the cheek bones to add sparkle and give the impression of dropped eyeshadow. Lips were nude with just a touch of Maybelline Baby Lips. Nails, created by Michelle Humphrey, saw Maybelline Color Show in Black Out painted directly onto bare nails in a chipped shape, which was topped with Color Show Sugar Crystals and translucent sequins - dazzling!

Its vast and sophisticated armed forces are trained to handle anything from home security to the Iraq war with a moment's notice. But in case anybody had forgotten that, the US Air Force has refreshed our memories - by dropping a 2,000lb bomb worth $24,000 on a miniature pirate boat. Wielding power: A laser-guided GBU-10 targets the mini pirate ship at a training range in the Gulf of Mexico . Floating silently in the Gulf of Mexico on September 4, the boat looked far from threatening. But metres away, a B1 was creeping into the air, armed with a laser-guided GBU-10. Originally designed for the Cold War, the GBU-10 was touted as one of the most lethal weapons the Force could wield against Russia. However, it was not used until 1998 fighting Iraq. Ballistics experts have spent the last few years focussing on the weapon; tailoring it for modern-day use. The $23,700 bomb (£15,000) blasted the toy into cinders as another bomber and a fighter aircraft zoomed menacingly around. It was a demonstration to show how even their biggest bombs can obliterate small water-borne objects. Blast: The exploded boat was sent flying in pieces as the $24,000 bomb plunged into the sea . The pilots also dropped a 500lb GBU-54 bomb and five other explosives. Proudly displaying the images on their media page, the Air Force Dyess Air Base explained this tactic would be useful if targeting real-life pirate ships. The stunt sparked a torrent of jokes on Twitter. One person tweeted: 'Overkill defined'. Another said: 'This image is today's Americaniest thing'. And one man joked: 'Yay! Good guys win!'","Laser-guided GBU-10 built for Cold War dropped on toy in Gulf of Mexico .

London art students have designed a bike helmet made from old newspapers to provide cheap and accessible head protection for people using Boris Bikes to navigate the capital.

The paper-mache hats cost just £1 to produce and is waterproof for six hours, but it is not known how effective it would be in a collision.

The students came up with the idea after noticing the number of discarded newspapers around the capital and decided that recycled paper, converted into paper mache, would be the most practical material for their disposable helmets. Tom Gottelier, 25, Bobby Petersen, 28 and Edward Thomas, 25, began thinking about the safety of London cyclists having noticed people spontaneously using Boris bikes never carried head protection. In their design, the discarded newspaper is turned into pulp mixed with adhesive and pigment before it is vacuum formed and heated to resemble the shape of helmet. Straps can then be slotted into the grooves on the helmet's criss-crossed top before being fastened under the chin. The discarded newspaper is turned into pulp mixed with adhesive and pigment before it is vacuum formed and heated to resemble the shape of helmet . The designers say these helmets can withstand a significant amount of pressure and hope that one day they will be available in vending machines and nearby shops next to Boris bike stations as well as locations such as New York where the idea has recently been rolled out to mixed reviews. Each helmet will cost under £1 to produce, will comply with En 10789 safety standards and, by using the same eco additive used to produce NHS wash bowls, will be fully waterproof for in excess of six hours. However they have not been tested in a collision. Designer Tom Gottelier said: 'The idea to . use paper pulp came about through standing around on tube platforms, . sitting in buses and trains watching Metro and Evening Standard . newspapers blow around. The students, from the Royal College of Art, hope that their disposable and eco-friendly helmets will one day be available in vending machines and shops close to Boris bike stations . 'We had previously seen what kind of structural integrity could be gained from moulding paper pulp and it seemed like a logical step to use this vast resource that currently circulates our public transport network. 'Unlike the recycling of newspapers into new newspaper, which requires a lot of energy and bleaching in order to get the paper white enough again to print on, making helmets requires no artificial additives.' The students said that by using the same waterproofing agent as used to make paper pulp wash bowls and buckets as well as natural dyes, they can produce the recyclable and biodegradable helmets for under £1, using very little energy. Straps can then be slotted into the grooves on the helmet's criss-crossed top before being fastened under the chin, as pictured. The designers say these helmets can withstand a significant amount of pressure . Mr Gottelier said: 'Our current helmets are 2mm thick which already provides an amazing amount of strength and impact absorption, but the next prototype we are working on with an industrial partner we will be able to produce a helmet that is 9mm thick. 'Our overriding concept for the helmet is for it to be distributed in conjunction with the Barclays Bike hire scheme, with the price include in the hire of the bike. 'We agree that people should have a choice to use a helmet, but we do believe from the research that we have gathered that you are much better of wearing one, even if its 25 per cent more effective than not wearing one. 'Twenty five per cent is something all of us would like to take.

Controversial policy: The bedroom tax has sparked fierce protests and has put 50,000 in rent arrears, it was claimed today . The Government's so-called 'bedroom tax' has tipped nearly one in three affected council tenants into rent arrears and many face eviction, it emerged today. Since the reform was introduced in April, 50,000 households in 114 local council areas can no longer afford to pay for their accommodation. At least one in three of those affected face eviction, the False Economy group today claimed. The figures, obtained by the TUC-backed anti-cuts group showed some parts of Britain are suffering far more than others. In Barrow, Cumbria, three quarters had fallen into arrears. Other areas where the proportion was at least half were Clackmannanshire - 67 per cent -  Tamworth  - 52 per cent -  South Kesteven - 51 per cent - and Rotherham on 50 per cent. A separate study, by the National Housing Federation (NHF), showed a quarter of those in housing association properties affected by the policy had been pushed into rent arrears since the change. It found that a quarter of tenants affected by the reform in 38 housing associations it questioned had become unable any longer to pay the rent between April and June. Under the welfare reform, social tenants deemed to have more bedrooms than they need have had their housing benefit reduced, to tackle what the Government calls a 'spare room subsidy'. Ministers say private sector renters do not get spare rooms for free, and argue the change will save around £500 million annually. It has sparked protests across the country with opponents claiming it is forcing families into poverty and will increase the benefits bill by pushing people into the private sector. Scroll down for video . Policy: The 'spare room subsidy', to use its official name, reduces housing benefit for those who have more bedrooms than they need . The Department for Work and Pensions dismissed the significance of the findings and defended 'a necessary reform to return fairness to housing benefit'. 'It is just wrong to suggest the early stages of the policy - as people start to adjust to the changes - represent long-term trends in any way whatsoever,' a spokesman said. 'We are carefully monitoring the policy nationally ensuring the extra funds to support vulnerable tenants are used well as these changes are introduced.' Row: TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady says bedroom tax 'is pushing up rent arrears which will force councils to waste more cash on evictions' But False Economy said the early figures were likely to be on the low side as emergency funds supplied to town halls to ease the burden would quickly dry up and leave more with no help. Campaign manager Clifford Singer said: 'Together with the raft of other benefits cuts the Government has forced through both this year and previously, the bedroom tax is driving tenants and families who were just making ends meet into arrears, and pushing those who were already struggling with the cost of living into a full-blown crisis. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady added: 'The bedroom tax is not saving money. Instead it is pushing up rent arrears which will force councils to waste more cash on evictions, debt collection and emergency support for homeless families. 'It says a lot about this Government's commitment to fairness that they've blocked a mansion tax for millionaires but are happy to go ahead with a bedroom tax on disabled and low paid families, no matter how much chaos and misery it causes.' Liberal Democrat activists voted overwhelmingly at the party's conference in Glasgow to commit the party to a review of the policy's impact on vulnerable families . NHF chief executive David Orr - who will set out his criticisms in a speech to the Federation's conference later - said: 'This is the most damning evidence yet to show that the bedroom tax is pushing thousands of families into a spiralling cycle of debt. Shadow work and pensions secretary Liam Byrne said: 'The jury is now in. 'David Cameron's hated 'bedroom tax' is pushing a generation into foodbanks and loan-sharks. This Government seems determined to stand up for a privileged few, but stands idle while hundreds of thousands of our neighbours are pushed into debt from which they may never recover.'","50,000 in 114 areas cannot afford to pay council or housing association .

If you want to know what the latest ‘It Bag’ is, the one on Angelina Jolie’s arm is usually a pretty good place to start. At the moment that’s Louis Vuitton’s Capucines handbag, which is selling out across Europe as fashionistas flock to get their hands on one. But would-be buyers have to have deep pockets – it costs up to £3,250. Assistants at the Louis Vuitton shop in New Bond Street, London, said the bags had sold out. They are unlikely to be back in stock until the end of the month, and then in small numbers – prompting suspicions the shortage may be a marketing ruse. But is it worth the wait – and the cash? Fashion writer NICOLE MOWBRAY gives her verdict … . A-list fan: Angelina Jolie has been spotted with a Capucine . After parting with a significant amount of cash for this season’s must-have bag, it’s more than a little galling when it becomes noticeably ‘last season’. It’s even worse when the design pops up everywhere, thanks to labels and prints now being notoriously easy to fake. Louis Vuitton, with its much-copied tan and brown monogram design, must have felt the latter particularly keenly. Which explains why, with the understated Capucines, the French label is turning the emphasis away from trends and back to timeless style. The bag is named after the Rue des Capucines in Paris, where Louis Vuitton opened his first shop in 1854. With it, the brand seems to be celebrating craftsmanship rather than the brash logos for which it has been known of late. Creating a buzz: Louis Vuitton launched the £3,000 Capucine bag earlier this year with the help of Michelle Williams . Waiting list: There's currently only one of the Capucine bags displayed as a sample in Louis Vuitton's London's New Bond Street store . Indeed, the success of the bag marks a . turnaround for the brand, which has been struggling to win back its . reputation as an upmarket and exclusive label. The . Capucines is made with full-grain Taurillon calf-leather, which comes . from the top layer of a hide. It is subjected to minimal chemical . processing (which can weaken it) and so is known for its quality, . durability and signature texture. This . is the same leather used by Hermes – which is famous for still . operating long waiting lists for its coveted Kelly and Birkin bags, . decades after they launched. In demand: Michelle Williams models the different colours of the bag - but for others who want to get their hands on it, there's currently a waiting list at stores across Europe . Assistants . in Louis Vuitton stores have suggested the brand is also using Hermes’s . tactic of ‘drip-feeding’ limited numbers of the Capucines into shops, . to encourage demand. So . there we have it. Those with serious money to spend – the Capucines . costs £3,000 in medium, and £3,250 in large – will be making a serious . style understatement this season. If . you’d like to follow suit for less, take a look at Raoul. The label . offers bags which are just as nice, at a tenth of the price. Or, on the high street, Zara has a classic leather bag with a simple metal tab for a much more purse-friendly £109. Jolie's must-have: The fact one of the world's most beautiful women has the bag makes it even more desirable to fashionistas . Hard to get: The bag comes in a variety of colours but is currently unavailable to buy via the fashion house's website .

Private firms could be sending astronauts to live on the moon by 2020, a Nasa commissioned report has claimed. The study by Bigelow Aerospace, shows 'a lot of excitement and interest from various companies' for such ventures, said Robert Bigelow, founder and president of the Las Vegas-based firm, which is bidding to make the first inflatable lunar bases. The projects range from pharmaceutical research aboard Earth-orbiting habitats, to missions to the moon's surface. A model of an inflatable lunar base: A new Nasa report claims private firms could lead to astronauts living on the lunar surface by 2020 . NASA intends to follow the International Space Station program with astronaut visits to an asteroid by 2025 and to Mars about a decade later, according to the most recent plans. President Barack Obama's proposed budget for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 requests $105 million for the U.S. space agency to begin work on a mission to find a small asteroid and reposition it around the moon for a future visit by astronauts. But private companies, including Bigelow Aerospace, have more interest in the moon itself, Bigelow told reporters on a conference call. William Gerstenmaier, NASA's head of space operations, said on the call 'it's important for us to know that there's some interest in moon activity and lunar surface activity.' 'We can take advantage of what the private sector is doing' in areas such as space transportation, life support systems and other technologies needed for travel beyond the space station's 250 mile (400 km) high orbit, he noted.

Running long distances can be boring and tedious, but what if you could run on a treadmill and read a book or newspaper at the same time? Weartrons, a group of New York-based developers, has created a fitness tracker called Run-n-Read that lets you do just that - it clips onto a headband or shirt collar and tracks the runner's head and shoulders. Run-n-Read then syncs with an dedicated e-reader app on a tablet or phone and will bounce the text on the screen in time with a runner's eye movements, making it appear as if the words aren't moving at all. Scroll down for video . The Run-n-Read clip from New York-based Weartrons, pictured, can be attached to a headband or shirt collar and tracks head and shoulder movements. The system works with a dedicated e-reader app installed on a tablet or phone and will bounce the text on the screen in sync with the runner's eyes . The clip has a built-in accelerometer to measure speed and movement and connects to an Android or iOS tablet wirelessly via Bluetooth. To move through the book, a runner can tap the device once to go forward a page, or twice to go back . Run-n-Read can be used with treadmills, elliptical trainers, stepmills, stairmasters, and exercise bikes. Its makers add that it can also help reduce eye strain when travelling on a train, bus, or car. It has a built-in accelerometer to measure speed and movement and connects to a smartphone and tablet via Bluetooth. The clip syncs with a dedicated e-reader app available for iOS and Android devices and as the runner moves, the text bounces in time with their eyes. The company claims: 'The system essentially makes reading while running in a stationary position as easy as reading while standing motionless.' Weartrons is currently asking for funding using the Dragon Innovation website in order to mass produce the product. The company has raised around $8,000 (around £5,000) of its $30,000 (£19,000) goal and, if successful, plans to ship the device by January 2014 for around $40 (£25). Run-n-Read can be used with 'treadmills, elliptical trainers, stepmills, stairmasters, and exercise bikes.' Its makers add that it can also help reduce eye strain when travelling on a train, bus, or car. To flip between pages on a book, the runner can either swipe the screen of the tablet or tap the Run-n-Read clip once to move forward a page, or twice to move back. The clip can work out the position of a runner's eyes by monitoring the movement of their head, when attached to a headband, pictured left, or by tracking shoulder movements when attached to a shirt collar, pictured right. The device is also a fitness tracker and can additionally be fitted to a belt when not being used for reading . The Run-n-Read clips has a rechargeable battery that Weartrons claims will last for 20 hours . The clip contains an accelerometer to measure speed and a low energy Bluetooth chip that connects it wirelessly to a compatible smartphone or tablet. There is also a rechargeable battery with a micro-USB port and Weartrons claims the clip will last for 20 hours when used regularly, or one month on standby. It weighs 10g and is approximately one inch wide by 1.25 inches tall. Run-n-Read will additionally track the runner's steps and calories burned. The device only works with the dedicated iOS or Android app, that also displays the workout history and physical activity levels. When being used to track fitness, and not for reading, the clip can be worn on a belt. Weartrons are in discussion with airlines and gyms to add the technology to various equipment. The company is also looking at ways to make it work with a television screen, for example.","Run-n-Read clips to a headband or shirt collar to track head movements .

But even worse is having to carry around a bulky spare battery twice the size of your slim and lightweight smartphone in case this happens. But now an inventor from Singapore has come up with a solution by developing a credit-card sized device that allows you to wirelessly charge your phone on the move. Scroll down for video... The WiFlux device uses an inductive coil in charging circuitry that fits into packaging that is 72mm x 55mm x 5.5mm. To power your phone, you simply stick a charged WiFlux device to the back of it . ‘In order to keep up with the pace of modern power consumption, many resort to carrying additional power packs in an effort to remain connected in this wireless world,’ said creator Raffi Ismail. ‘Portable charging in this manner seems like the stone age, especially when wireless charging and ultra-thin lithium polymer batteries are already a reality.’ The WiFlux device uses an inductive coil in charging circuitry that fits into packaging that is 72mm x 55mm x 5.5mm. The system is made up of a receiver and a transmitter. The receiver will stick or get fitted on the back of your mobile phone and plugs into a micro USB port. The transmitter will contain a 850mAh lithium polymer battery. The receiver is shown on the left and wireless charger on the right. It won't provide a complete charge, as with cable-based systems, but it buys you some time before plugging your smartphone into the mains . The device won’t provide a complete charge, as with cable-based systems, but it buys you some time before plugging your smartphone into the mains. ‘We're rushing to finish the prototype for the WiFlux Card, focusing at the moment on the inductive wireless transmitter card and the receiver coils,’ said Mr Ismail. ‘The circuitry for the mobile charging portion has been challenging to design, as we are trying to deliver 0.25W from the receiving coil to the charging input.’ The WiFlux project is currently raising funds on the Indiegogo website. The creators are hoping to receive $100,000 and are so far $588 towards their goal. If they can hit their target, the charger will be available from January 2014. The price is £25, but early-bird backers can reserve one for £22.30, or receive a customised version for £127. Currently, only two versions of the WiFlux charging system are available for the Samsung Galaxy S2, S3 and S4 and for the iPhone 4, 4S and 5. When placed near each other, the charger will wireless supply the receiver with power. At present, the prototype runs off a 9V battery, and provides 5V from the receiver. The goal is to reduce this to 3.7V on the charger and up the voltage to 5V from the receiver while maintaining a slim profile .","Device charges using inductive coil in packaging that is just 5.5mm thick .

Pope Francis made his first comments on the Shroud of Turin in a video message, suggesting that 'the Man of the Shroud invites us to contemplate Jesus of Nazareth' Pope Francis explicitly linked the Shroud of Turin to Jesus Christ in the same week forensic tests proved the cloth could have been produced during Christ's lifetime. In a special video message, the newly elected pontiff suggested that the 'Man of the Shroud invites us to contemplate Jesus of Nazareth'. He was speaking as the mysterious imprinted cloth was displayed on television for only the second time. Earlier this week, researchers dated a sample of the 14ft linen sheet to anything between 300BC to 400AD. The Catholic Church has long avoided a definite approach regarding the cloth's authenticity, but Francis's language was provocative. He said: 'This disfigured face resembles all those . faces of men and women marred by a life which does not respect their . dignity, by war and violence which afflict the weakest. 'And . yet, at the same time, the face in the Shroud conveys a great peace; . this tortured body expresses a sovereign majesty.' Speaking on Easter Saturday, a day before his first Holy Week address in front of thousands of Catholics in St. Peter's Square, Francis said the cloth 'has the face of one who is dead'. He added: 'And yet mysteriously he is watching us, and in silence he speaks to us.' Some commentators drew upon his use of the word 'icon', rather than 'relic', perhaps suggesting it plays a more symbolic role. This was backed up by the pontiff's evocative language. He said the cloth, which is housed in a bulletproof, climate-controlled case within Turin Cathedral, 'expresses a sovereign majesty'. The 90-minute broadcast on state television network RAI was introduced by Pope Francis. He said: 'This image, impressed upon the cloth, speaks to our heart and moves us to climb the hill of Calvary, to look upon the wood of the Cross, and to immerse ourselves in the eloquent silence of love.' The shroud, which is one of . Catholicism’s most controversial relics, was once described by Pope John . Paul II as ‘an icon of suffering in every age’. The . recent scientific findings are in a new book called Il Mistero della . Sindone (The Mystery of the Shroud) which is published on Good Friday. Hope for the faithful:The latest scientific results date the fibres from the cloth of the Turin Shroud to a period between 300BC to 400AD, which covers the years of Christ's life . Many experts stand by carbon-dating of scraps of the cloth that date it to the 13th or 14th century. However, some have suggested the dating results might have been skewed by contamination and have called for a larger sample to be analyzed. The Vatican has tiptoed around just what the cloth is, calling it a powerful symbol of Christ's suffering while making no claim to its authenticity. The cloth is only rarely open to the public. The last time was in 2010 when more than two million people lined up to pray before it and Pope Benedict XVI visited. Describing the cloth, the Pope emeritus said: 'This is a burial cloth that wrapped the remains of a crucified man in . full correspondence with what the Gospels tell us of Jesus.' The latest display coincided with Holy Saturday, when Catholics mark the period between Christ's crucifixion on Good Friday and his resurrection on Easter Sunday. A few hundred people, many in wheelchairs, were invited inside the cathedral for the service, which was presided over by Turin's archbishop. It was only the second time the shroud has gone on display specifically for a TV audience; the first was in 1973 at the request of Pope Paul VI, the Vatican said. Dear Brothers and Sisters, . I join all of you gathered before the Holy Shroud, and I thank the Lord who, through modern technology, offers us this possibility. Even if it takes place in this way, we do not merely “look”, but rather we venerate by a prayerful gaze. I would go further: we are in fact looked upon upon ourselves. This face has eyes that are closed, it is the face of one who is dead, and yet mysteriously he is watching us, and in silence he speaks to us. How is this possible? How is it that the faithful, like you, pause before this icon of a man scourged and crucified? It is because the Man of the Shroud invites us to contemplate Jesus of Nazareth. This image, impressed upon the cloth, speaks to our heart and moves us to climb the hill of Calvary, to look upon the wood of the Cross, and to immerse ourselves in the eloquent silence of love. Let us therefore allow ourselves to be reached by this look, which is directed not to our eyes but to our heart. In silence, let us listen to what he has to say to us from beyond death itself.By means of the Holy Shroud, the unique and supreme Word of God comes to us: Love made man, incarnate in our history; the merciful love of God who has taken upon himself all the evil of the world to free us from its power. This disfigured face resembles all those faces of men and women marred by a life which does not respect their dignity, by war and violence which afflict the weakest… And yet, at the same time, the face in the Shroud conveys a great peace; this tortured body expresses a sovereign majesty. It is as if it let a restrained but powerful energy within it shine through, as if to say: have faith, do not lose hope; the power of the love of God, the power of the Risen One overcomes all things. So, looking upon the Man of the Shroud, I make my own the prayer which Saint Francis of Assisi prayed before the Crucifix: . Most High, glorious God, enlighten the shadows of my heart, and grant me a right faith, a certain hope and perfect charity, sense and understanding, Lord, so that I may accomplish your holy and true command. Amen.","Pope Francis spoke ahead of televised broadcast displaying the shroud .

In a blistering warning to congressional Republicans, President Obama said Monday it would be the 'height of irresponsibility' for lawmakers to cause a new economic crisis just five years after the near-collapse of the nation's financial system. 'I cannot remember a time when one faction of one party promises economic chaos if it can't get 100 percent of what it wants,' Obama said. Some of those Republicans say they will vote to extend current spending levels or to increase the nation's debt ceiling only if Obama delays putting in place his health care law, a condition Obama has rejected. Others say scheduled spending cuts should stay in place to reduce the deficit, while Obama wants the 'sequestration' cuts reworked. Anniversary: Barack Obama spoke Monday at an event pegged to the fifth anniversary of the collapse of Lehmann Bros. investment bank, which marked the start of a worldwide economic downturn . The president spoke at a White House event pegged to the fifth anniversary of the bankruptcy of the Lehman Brothers investment bank, which marked the beginning of a global financial crisis. The White House used the anniversary to lay out the president's markers for upcoming fiscal fights with Congress over funding the government and raising the nation's debt limit. Obama's remarks came as local and federal authorities dealt with the deadly shootings at the Washington Navy Yard, just a few miles from the White House. At least 12 people were killed, authorities said. No drama: Obama asked congress to 'pass a budget without drama' after warning Republicans not to interfere with his continued economic recovery efforts . Obama delayed his remarks to allow Washington's mayor and police chief to update the public on the situation. He pledged to make sure 'whoever carried out this cowardly act is held responsible.' In the remarks, the president reiterated his refusal to negotiate with Republicans over the debt ceiling. And he called on Congress to 'pass a budget without drama.' The president was flanked by Americans the White House says have benefited from his administration's economic and banking policies. Those policies, he said, have laid a 'new foundation' for economic growth, though he acknowledged that the recovery is not being felt by many middle class people. The White House's National Economic Council on Sunday issued a report detailing policies that it says have helped put the economy on a path toward growth. Those steps range from the unpopular Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, that shored up the financial industry and bailed out auto giants General Motors and Chrysler, to an $800 billion stimulus bill to sweeping new bank regulations. Gene Sperling, a top Obama adviser and director of the National Economic Council, said Obama's policies 'have performed better than virtually anyone at the time predicted.' But the public is not convinced that the economy is on the mend. Only one-third say the economic system is more secure now than in 2008, and 52 percent say they disapprove of Obama's handling of the economy, according to a Pew Research Center poll. There is still plenty of pain to justify their pessimism. 'Height of irresponsibility': Obama blasted Republicans like Minority Leader Mitch McConnel and House Speaker John Boehner for their stances he said amount to threatening economic chaos . Despite job growth, the unemployment rate remains high at 7.3 percent. Though the rate has fallen, one of the reasons is because some people have dropped out of the labor force and no longer are counted as job seekers. The share of unemployed workers who have been unemployed for more than six months is more than double what it was in 2007 before the recession began. And the income gap between the very rich and the rest of the population is the biggest since 1928. What's more, some banks that received government aid because they were deemed 'too big to fail' are now bigger than they were in 2008, although they are smaller as a share of the economy than the largest banks in other big economies. Three years after Obama signed a sweeping overhaul of lending and high-finance rules, execution of that law is behind schedule. Anxious to make his case with the public, Obama intends to draw attention to signs of progress with daily events this week, including a speech Wednesday to the Business Roundtable, an association of CEOs from the top U.S. companies, and a trip Friday to Kansas City to visit a Ford plant, where he will promote the strength of the auto industry. Obama wants to reverse automatic spending cuts that kicked in in March, but at the same time he has said he will not negotiate with Republicans over the nation's debt ceiling. His remarks have hinted at a potential constitutional confrontation with Republicans. Section 4 of the 14th Amendment says that 'the validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned.' In addition to seeking a delay in Obama's health care law, some Republicans say the scheduled spending cuts should stay in place to reduce the deficit. 'We need to start by keeping the cuts we've already agreed to,' Sen. Mitch McConnell said Sunday. 'It's time to get serious about the challenges we face and reposition America for growth and prosperity in the 21st century.'","The president spoke at an event pegged to the five-year anniversary of the fall of Lehman Brothers .

The Secret Service was alerted after one of the prostitutes complained to police that she had not been paid by one of the agents.

The agents had arrived in Colombia earlier in the week to check security. An employee at the Hotel Caribe claimed that the men had been drinking heavily before the alleged incident.

A treasure trove of more than 100 love letters sent from a lovestruck teenager to his sweetheart has brought the couple back together after more than 30 years apart. Loraine Atkins, 47, received the first letter from Terry McGurk in 1982 when she was 16 while they were both pupils at The Queens School in Bushey, Hertfordshire. They dated for two years after meeting in the school playground and Terry wrote Loraine letters nearly every day. Some of the letters were more than 20 pages long. Terry and Loraine at Loraine's house in Watford. She says she knew Terry was the one for her . Terry declared his undying love for his girlfriend time and time again. When he was 15 he wrote: 'I think I'm falling for you - I really mean it.' The pair went their separate ways when Loraine left school a year ahead of Terry and got a job as a shopworker. They each went on to marry other people, but Loraine kept the letters as a keepsake of her first love, hiding them under her bed for more than three decades. She said: 'The first letter that Terry sent to me was put in my locker, just to say hello. 'As the letters came in I collected them in a tin box. As I grew older I didn't want to throw them away, so I still kept the box under my bed. 'Terry was my first love, and the letters were a big part of my life.' A loveletter from Terry to Loraine describing Loraine as beautiful, gorgeous, adorable, sexy and sweet (l) and one reading 'I love you and I will make sure we will never split' (r) Other messages contained in the letters, which are dated from the early 1980s, include 'I can't bear another day without seeing you', 'I'll be dreaming of you' and 'I love you more than ever and will make sure we never split'. But faced with the question of what path she wanted her life to take after leaving school, Loraine dumped Terry in 1983 and the pair completely lost contact. She went on to marry another man in 2003 but by 2008 her marriage was in difficulties and she was facing divorce. In her sadness, she turned to the letters beneath her bed. She said: 'I wept as I re-read the heartfelt letters from all those years ago. I thought about all the time which had passed, and how happy I'd been with Terry.

'I realised I had to know how he was, what kind of person he'd become, what sort of life he was leading.' Loraine, an office administrator, took to Facebook and in October 2011 she found Terry, who was now living just 12 miles away. She did not know that school caretaker Terry, who had divorced in 2001 after an 11-year marriage, and who had been with a new partner since 2002, was also facing difficulties in his own relationship. Terry, 46, said: 'When Loraine first contacted me on Facebook, I was excited, but I panicked. I was going through a messy break-up. 'I deleted my Facebook account and tried not to think about her, but after six months, I got back in touch. I couldn't help it, but she was always on my mind.' Loraine said: 'I had so many questions. It was great to talk to him, but I never imagined in my wildest dreams that we would get back together.' From Terry: 'for a while there I thought you fancied Soggy. I was really jealous thinking I might lose you' Terry and Loraine pictured together recently with Terry's daughter April . But as their conversations continued, Loraine found herself falling back in love with her long-lost boyfriend. 'I was still technically married, but I knew Terry was the one for me. In my heart, I had known it all along.' The pair eventually arranged to meet and had a day out in Henley on Thames in April 2012.Terry said: 'I was nervous, but she brought along some of the letters I had written to her when I was in school. 'I was flattered that she had kept them. It was as if we'd never been apart.' Loraine said: 'I knew instantly that I still loved him.

'He was all I had ever wanted. Why else would I have kept those letters? It sounds cheesy, but I knew he was the one for me.'

Police forces are costing taxpayers millions of pounds - because they cannot agree details such as how many pockets their uniforms should have, an official report has warned. Senior officers are unable to agree on which high-visibility jacket to buy for their officers and what model of handcuffs to use. They also disagree on what boots to buy and even what kind of paper to use. As a result, they were not saving money from bulk buying, MPs said. Break with tradition: North Wales Police officers wear baseball caps which the force used to replace traditional helmets. Uniform is not ordered centrally - so police waste millions because they do not buy in bulk . The Public Accounts Committee also found some forces appeared to have no idea how much individual items cost - and were unable to provide the information. Its report said that the lack of central procurement by the 43 forces in England and Wales had resulted in ‘unacceptable’ variations in the prices they paid for standard items of equipment. The price of standard issue handcuffs ranged from £14 to £43 and for boots from £25 to £114. Forces even paid wildly different prices . for identical items. One type of high-visibility jacket varied in price . by 33 per cent between forces. Different uniforms: Police forces paid between £14 and £43 for handcuffs, MPs said. Here a City of London police officer can be seen stood outside New Scotland Yard . Auditors found forces also disagreed on what kind of riot shields to buy, whether they should be round, curved or long, interlocking and how they vary in weight and thickness. Some forces prefer shields with map holders and dog handling straps. Shields cost between £31 and £136 depending on the force. Body armour varied in areas such as thickness and colour and in price from £203 to £410. The committee chairman, Margaret Hodge, said forces’ spending on equipment was £1.7 billion, making it essential they obtained best value for money so they could focus resources on fighting crime. ‘Forces can make big savings through bulk-buying of items, but have been unable to agree on the most simple things, like how many pockets they should have on their uniforms,’ she said. ‘We recognise that police and crime commissioners have authority over local spending but, as the department remains accountable for public money voted by Parliament, it cannot step back from value for money issues.’ There are 43 forces in England and Wales, each with its own elected police and crime commissioner, making it hard for them to reach agreement on such simple items as uniforms. The report revealed a similar collective buying approach by the Prison Service saved 30 per cent across the country. Matthew Sinclair, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘It’s an obvious and entirely avoidable waste of taxpayers’ money that some police forces are paying three times as much as others for basic items. ‘Some police chiefs are clearly getting better deals for local residents’ cash, meaning more of their budget can be spent on fighting crime, rather than purchasing officers’ boots and the like. ‘Greater cooperation is urgently needed between forces in order to secure best value for money because it would be inexcusable to allow the vast differences in procurement costs to continue any longer.’","Handcuffs ranged in price from £14 to £43, a probe found .

Plans to build the first house in Britain designed by the renowned 20th century American architect Frank Lloyd Wright have been revealed today. Engineer Dr Hugh Pratt and his wife have been granted a licence by the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation to use a design originally created in the 1940s for a site in California. The plans were never used and now new drawings have been produced, upgrading the building to fit in with 21st century regulations and building methods.

If approved by planners, the proposed property would be built on a plot of green belt land which once formed part of the Tyntesfield Estate, south of Bristol. The development will be the last house designed by Wright to be built anywhere in the world. Noted: The architect, pictured when he was 87, who created over a thousand buildings, died in 1959 . Dr Pratt has vowed to make the building open for public viewing and has even drawn up a transport plan with visitor access by a six-seater mini-bus. Architect Stephen Brooks, who is based in Bath, Somerset, has been working with the Foundation to reconcile the original plans with 21st century regulations. He said: 'Outside the US and Japan there is only one other Frank Lloyd Wright-designed building. 'Dr Pratt has worked for many years in the United States as a specialist in preventing construction crane fatalities. 'This opportunity to be selected to build a Frank Lloyd Wright house can be seen as an accolade to him and this country.'

The Pratts have made improvements to public footpath access, and the habitat, including creating a new lake. It is hoped the house would use lake water for underground heating, with fresh water coming from natural springs. Frank Lloyd Wright was an American architect, interior designer and writer who designed more than 1,000 structures and completed 532 works. Wright was keen on designing buildings that would be in harmony the environment, a philosophy he called 'organic architecture'. He died in April 1959. He is best known for buildings such as: .

Owner: When Alexandre Gayamak, left, bought the . club the chairs, seen with expert Deborah Lambert, were put into a skip . but were saved and have been kept in storage for the last seven years . ‘My company actually carried out the works, and to my horror, these – and a table – were literally in the skip. ‘There are 14 chairs and I believe it’s a five-leafed table, which I’ve kept in storage for the last seven years. ‘I believe it [the furniture] was donated by one of the authorities within the Navy, because it was originally on HMS Warrior.’ Miss Lambert said the chairs – which were worth ‘thousands of pounds’ – dated to the mid 19th-century. She said: ‘I would say that these chairs . date from around 1860-1870. They’re made of oak, and are a very . characteristic kind of yellowish colour that you find in the 19th . century. Historic: Built at a cost of £377,000 in 1860, HMS Warrior was Britain's first armour-plated, iron-hulled ship . Winston Churchill and Field Marshal Montgomery, right, sat on the chairs as they drew up battleplans in WW2 . ‘Stylistically they certainly fit with the period of HMS Warrior, which was commissioned in 1861.’ The builder said he hoped to give the valuable furniture back to the club when the current owners had ‘changed their taste’. HMS Warrior was built for the Royal Navy in 1859-61. She and her sister ship Black Prince were the first armour-plated, iron-hulled warships, and were built in response to France’s launching in 1859 of the first ocean-going ironclad warship, the wooden-hulled Gloire. HMS Warrior became obsolete after the 1871 launching of the mastless and more capable Devastation. She served as a storeship and depot ship, and in 1904 was assigned to the Royal Navy’s torpedo training school. In 1979, the ship was donated to the Maritime Trust. After it was restored, it returned to Portsmouth as a museum ship. Troubles: Portsmouth FC has had more than its fair share of financial troubles . Known as Pompey, Portsmouth . Football Club is much loved by its fans who have accompanied it through . every up and down of the club's history. And there have been plenty of them since it was founded in 1898.

British Airways is following its budget rivals by charging passengers to check in their baggage on short-haul flights. The airline announced a £10 fee to put luggage in the hold on some of its routes from Heathrow and London City. It will come into effect later this month on flights to Amsterdam, Barcelona, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Paris, Rome, Rotterdam and Stockholm. Budget: British Airways passengers will soon be able to fly from London Heathrow and City airports on a 'no-frills' hand-luggage only ticket . BA said it is making short-haul . flights cheaper for those who do not want to fly with hold luggage, but . denied that it had been forced to change its fares structure to compete . with budget airlines. ‘We are basically offering the fare to adapt to travellers’ requirements and to give them what they want,’ said a spokesman. The charge follows a trial over the summer on short-haul routes from Gatwick, where BA faces strong competition from easyJet. Many . airlines now impose add-on charges for services including baggage, . food, seat reservations, priority boarding, fast-track security or seats . with more legroom. These now comprise up to 5 per cent of airlines’ total income, compared with less than 1 per cent five years ago. Saving time and money: Not only will passengers save themselves £10, but they might also avoid the queue to check larger items of luggage into the hold . Robin . Glover-Faure, BA head of short haul, said: ‘The hand-baggage-only fare . at Gatwick has proved popular with customers, so we’re now introducing . it on a selected number of short-haul routes from Heathrow and London . City. ‘If it proves as successful, we plan to roll it out across the whole short-haul network in the coming months.’ EasyJet charges between £9 and £19 for bags checked into the hold. Bags weighing more than 20kg cost customers flying with Ryanair £25. But . beware. If they do chose to take a bag to be checked in at the airport . after having booked a hand-luggage only ticket, passengers will pay an . additional £40 to stow their case. Competition: The move will see BA rival cheaper alternative carriers such as easyJet . The move will not affect long-haul flights, where BA faces strong competition from airlines offering larger baggage allowances. Aviation consultant John Strickland said BA needs to show that its no-baggage fares are competitive with low-cost carriers.

His disappearance almost forty years ago remains one of Britain's great mysteries, and now it is being made into a hotly anticipated ITV drama. Lord Lucan's new incarnation on the small screen is Rory Kinnear, and the Skyfall actor was pictured looking remarkably like the aristocrat while shooting scenes in London. The 35-year-old Othello star actor was seen portraying the missing Lucan yesterday. In Character: Rory Kinnear will star in an ITV drama of Lord Lucan's - the aristocrat vanished in 1974 following the murder of nanny, Sandra Rivett . The star had a moustache for the role and his hair slicked back. He wore a navy blue dinner jacket over a maroon jumper and shirt and tie with grey trousers and brogue type shoes. There are children in the scenes too, presumably playing Lord Lucan's three children who were left abandoned when their father infamously disappeared. Lucan vanished following the murder of his children's nanny on November 7, 1974. Mystery: what happened to the aristocrat remains unclear . After the attack, he went to the home of friends, telling them he had found the nanny had been murdered. Three . days later, his car was found abandoned in Newhaven, East Sussex, with . bloodstains on the front seat and a length of lead piping matching the . one found in the Belgravia basement. There was speculation he had committed suicide, but no body was found. An inquest jury declared the wealthy aristocrat the killer a year later. 1970s: Rory was dressed for the period . Action: The cast were seen shooting in full swing . In Character: Rory Kinnear was seen shooting scenes for the ITV dramatization of Lord Lucan's dissappearance on Wednesday . Controversial: The real aristocrat's son had expressed concerns about how the production would present his father's dissappearance . East-End gangster Dennis Stafford insists he met the elusive . aristocrat in Africa whilst on the run from authorities. Mystery: Lord Lucan with his son, George Bingham, now the 8th Lord Lucan, who claims he has not seen his father since his disappearance in November 1974 . The former friend of the Kray twins . says he came across Lord Lucan in the Monapatapa Hotel, in Harare, . Zimbabwe, he believes, sometime between 1982 and 1983. Engineers . Lawrie Prebble and Ian Meyrick also came forward to say they are . 'completely convinced' the man they saw drinking in a hotel bar in . Botswana with six friends is the legendary Lucan. What happened to Lucan remains a mystery and he was officially declared dead by the High Court in 1999 but there have been reported sightings of him as far afield as Australia, Ireland and South Africa. The two-part ITV drama is based on John Pearson's book The Gamblers, which claims Lucan's high-rolling friends who gathered at the Clermont Club in Mayfair, central London, and included Sir James Goldsmith and John Aspinall, spirited him out of the country after the murder. Former Doctor Who star Christopher Eccleston will play Aspinall and the cast also includes Michael Gambon. The aristocrat's son George Bingham met the makers of the drama this week to be reassured that the production would not be a 'fantasy drama'. A source told the Daily Mirror this week:'George was worried about how his father – this notorious figure and ­assumed murderer – would be portrayed.' 'He is a big fan of Rory Kinnear and thinks he is a brilliant actor but ­wanted to know which version of events the ­programme would follow.' 'Fortunately it seems the version they have chosen very much fits with what he thinks happened – that his father abandoned the family and killed himself at sea.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 15:29 EST, 18 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:41 EST, 19 September 2013 . A doctor who froze embryos with her boyfriend after she was diagnosed with cancer is now battling him in court after he broke up with her and said he no longer wants children. Karla Dunston, 42, maintains that she has the right to have her biological children and should control the future of the embryos, while her ex-boyfriend Jacob Szafranski, 32, argues that he never agreed to give up his say in the matter. The Illinois Supreme Court is expected . to reach a decision on whether it will hear Szafranski v. Dunston this month - a decision which will no doubt affect thousands of future would-be parents. Dunston has since gone on to carry and give birth to a son - using a donor egg and donor sperm, Szafranski's attorney confirmed. But he added that this does not affect the outcome of the case as the court distinguishes between a child that is biological and 'essentially adopted'. In court: Karla Dunston and Jacob Szafranski created frozen embryos with their egg and sperm after she was diagnosed with cancer. But they later broke up and he said he no longer wants her to use the embryos . The couple, who met through their work in a Chicago hospital, had been dating for just five months when Dunston was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in March 2010. Knowing that the chemotherapy could leave her infertile, she asked Szafranski if he would provide his sperm so that she could freeze embryos for potential future use. He agreed and one week later, he provided a sample at Northwestern Hospital's fertility clinic, the Chicago Tribune reported. 'It was a very emotional time and I was just trying to support Karla the best way I could,' the firefighter and former nurse told the newspaper. Dunston, in a court deposition, added: 'I thought about my different options, . of using a sperm donor or someone that I knew for many years and that . was a wonderful person. 'So I decided to go with someone that I thought . was a wonderful person and I trusted.' New life: She had a child through donors two years after they broke up but she is still fighting to use the embryos for another child. Lawyers said her baby would not affect the outcome of the case . Szafranski v. Dunston will set a new precedent in the state of Illinois, where lawmakers have never ruled in a similar case. But what decisions have been reached in other states, and what clues do they give to the outcome of the case? In Pennsylvania last year, an appeals court gave frozen embryos to a woman who wanted to give birth even though her ex-husband wanted to embryos destroyed. As in this Illinois case, the ex-wife was believed to be infertile following treatment for cancer. The court ruled that her wish to be a mother outweighed the man's desire not to parent children. But in Tennessee, a court has previously decided that parenthood could not be forced on someone who was not willing. The Supreme Court in 1992 ruled that fatherhood was going to be a greater burden for an ex-husband than destroying the embryos would be for his ex-wife, and she was not granted the embryos. Also similar to this case, a couple in New York who froze embryos signed an agreement saying they could only be used with consent from both parties. But the wife, who later became infertile, later requested sole custody of the embryos - which the husband opposed. The Court of Appeals ruled that the contract should stand and the embryos were donated to research. At the time, the couple also signed a document that stated 'no use can be made of these embryos without the consent of . both partners'. They met up with an attorney and a second agreement that gave Dunston sole control of the fertilized eggs was drawn up - but the couple never signed it. Two months after the hospital visit, Szafranski broke up with Dunston via text message. He said he had initially been honored to help out his girlfriend, but later had reservations. 'I have the right not to be a . father,' he said. 'It's something I take very seriously and feel very . strongly about.' But he later changed his mind and said that he would give Dunston control of the embryos if the child could never be traced back to him - but when he asked the hospital to destroy his records, they refused. He eventually concluded that the child would be traced back to him and that he did not want children at all, at any point. In June 2010, he wrote in an email that . he worried he would find someone he was ready to have a family with - . but that they would reject him based on the fact he had a child he did . not know with a women he did not love. But as had been predicted, Dunston was left infertile by her successful cancer treatment. Experts said that this infertility did not mean she was unable to carry the embryos and have a child. She wrote her ex-boyfriend an email in September 2010, reading: 'I had a chance to use a random . sperm donor and you took that away from me by agreeing to help. 'I . trusted you and now you are trying to take away my chance of having a . biological child... Those embryos mean everything to me, and I will . fight this to the bitter end.' Her right? Dunston said he agreed to have her children when he gave her his sperm for the embryo and cannot take away her right to have children. He argues he should not be forced to have them . After the fallout, a Cook County trial court awarded . Dunston rights to the embryos, but Szafranski appealed and a higher . court sent the case back, explaining that the case focuses on prior . agreements rather than the interests of either party. The battle now concerns whether the pact occurred when Szafranski gave the sample or when they signed the medical consent form requiring joint consent for the use of the embryos. His attorney, Brian Schroeder, argued that couple often change their minds about having children and the courts should not be involved. But Dunston's lawyer, Abram Moore, countered: 'At this point, that sperm no longer . exists. It has fertilized an egg and become something entirely . different: a pre-embryo. It is now too late for him to . back out of his promises.' The couple is now waiting for the Illinois Supreme Court to decide if they will hear the case. Dunston went on to carry a son and . gave birth to him, according to Mr Schroeder. He said that she used . donor eggs and sperm for the child, who was born in June 2010. Battle: The couple is now waiting for the Illinois Supreme Court to decide if they will hear the case . But . he added that her having a child would not affect the case as courts . differentiate between biological children and one that is essentially . adopted, he said. 'I think it should [affect . the case] but while it seems to affect the case practically, it doesn't . affect it legally,' he said. 'I don't think the court will consider it . as she could always adopt.' Dunston's attorney, Abram Moore, confirmed that his client never carried Szafranski's son but would not comment further. The case centers around a very modern problem - and an example of technology causing problems that far exceed the scope of the law. The need for a definitive ruling is needed now more than ever. In 1985, 260 babies were born through assisted reproductive technology; in 2010, the number topped 61,000, according to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. 'This is a decision that really affects every person,' he told MailOnline. 'Hundreds of thousands of embryos are frozen in Illinois and this case affects what you do with these. 'It raises some very fundamental issues about creating human life and when your consent is required and it affects all of those cases in the future.'","Karla Dunston was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in March 2010 and asked then-boyfriend to give his sperm for frozen embryos .

Six different . nationalities are represented on this year’s Man Booker Prize shortlist, . described as ‘most striking for its global range’. The six authors in the running for the £50,000 prize were announced yesterday. Despite . the list’s multi-cultural feel, the bookies’ favourite is British . author Jim Crace for Harvest, which he has said will be his final novel. Swansong: Writer Jim Crace, who has been shortlisted for the £50,000 Man Booker Prize with his novel Harvest, has announced it will be his last 'to avoid the inevitable bitterness' Robert . Macfarlane, chairman of the judges, said the shortlist – of four women . and  two men – reflected an ‘increasingly globalised world’. Two . of the nominees raised eyebrows as they have American backgrounds – the . contest, founded in 1969, is open only to writers from the . Commonwealth, Ireland and Zimbabwe. But the judges brushed off . speculation they would open up the competition to the US in the future. One . of the American authors is Ruth Ozeki, 57, a Buddhist priest with a . Canadian passport. She was born in New Haven, Connecticut in the United . States. The other is Jhumpa . Lahiri, 46, shortlisted for her novel The Lowland. Born in London and . of Indian origin, she was raised in Rhode Island and now lives in New . York. The shortlist was announced yesterday at the Man Group . headquarters in central London. Crace, . 67, was shortlisted for the Booker in 1997 for Quarantine. At 5/2, he . is the bookies’ favourite to win. Broadcaster Martha Kearney, one of the . judges, said his book showed the ‘harsh realities of rural life’ and . the ‘destruction of an English village and a long settled way of life’. Mr . Macfarlane said of the final six: ‘It is a shortlist that shows the . English language novel to be a form of world literature. 'This is a . shortlist that crosses continents, that joins countries and spans . centuries; Africa, Asia, Europe, North America and Australasia, all are . written about here. 'The six authors are of six different nationalities.’ He . said the longlist of 13 books was ‘unmistakably the most diverse . longlist in Man Booker prize history’ and the shortlist of six ‘is most . striking for its global range’. Double winner: Author Hilary Mantel won last year's Man Booker Prize with her novel Bring Up The Bodies . The . longlist was notable for its obscurity, after mostly unknown authors . made the nominations and a number of big-name authors were overlooked, . including JM Coetzee, Roddy Doyle and Margaret Atwood.

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 10:42 EST, 18 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:20 EST, 19 September 2013 . Tonight's Powerball jackpot in the U.S is estimated at $400 million, making it the nation's fifth-largest ever, though its jackpot hit $590 million earlier this year. The game's rules were changed in early 2012 to boost payoffs and now organizers of the country's other big lottery, Mega Millions, are planning changes of their own. Although Mega Millions still holds the record for the largest jackpot in U.S. history - a $656 million prize in March 2012 - organizers are hoping to more regularly see huge jackpots by lessening the odds of winning big while upping a player's shot at smaller but still hefty prizes. Bob Knowles buys a Powerball ticket on Tuesday in Des Moines, Iowa, to be in to win the $400m jackpot . Mega Millions doesn't plan to change its $1 ticket price, but an extra $1 option already in the game will be expanded to allow players to increase their secondary prize total to between $1 million and $5 million, a major increase from $250,000. Game changes also include boosting the starting jackpot from $12 million to $15 million, and allowing the jackpot to grow by at least $5 million between drawings when no top winner is selected. It's those jackpots, not the name on the game, that ultimately draw in 45-year-old Trent Shenefield. 'Depends on what's up the highest,' the electrician said Tuesday while at a QuickTrip convenience store in suburban Kansas City. 'I guess everyone wants to win the big one.' But fellow lottery player Bob Knowles, a school bus driver in Iowa, said the changes didn't really matter. The 62-year-old said he purchases tickets for both games several times a week and would be happy with any jackpot. 'That's nice, but I don't care. I can get by with $10 million. I can get by with $3 million,' he said after buying Powerball tickets at a grocery store in Des Moines. Laric Elbert shows his Powerball ticket, in Des Moines, Iowa, ahead of the jackpot . 'I just play along with the Mega and Powerball. What it starts off with would be pretty comfortable for me to win.' The changes take effect for the Oct. 22 drawing and were based on extensive consumer research, said Paula Otto, executive director for the Virginia Lottery and lead director for Mega Millions. She said officials decided not to increase ticket prices, but acknowledged Powerball's success after it increased its ticket prizes from $1 to $2. 'Certainly we were looking at the fact that changes that Powerball made, primarily by increasing the price point, it definitely favorably impacted the jackpot,' Otto said. 'It's doing what it's supposed to do, which is helping Powerball have bigger jackpots on a pretty consistent basis.' The Powerball jackpot is now the FIFTH biggest in U.S. history1. $656 million, Mega Millions, March 30, 2012 (3 tickets from Kansas, Illinois and Maryland)2. $590.5 million, Powerball, May 18, 2013 (1 ticket from Florida)3. $587.5 million, Powerball, Nov. 28, 2012 (2 tickets from Arizona and Missouri)4. $400 million, Powerball, (drawing scheduled for Wednesday, Aug. 7; jackpot could grow)5. $390 million, Mega Millions, March 6, 2007 (2 tickets from Georgia and New Jersey)6. $380 million, Mega Millions, Jan. 4, 2011 (2 tickets from Idaho and Washington)7. $365 million, Powerball, Feb. 18, 2006 (1 ticket from Nebraska)8. $363 million, The Big Game, May 9, 2000 (2 tickets from Illinois and Michigan)9. $340 million, Powerball, Oct. 19, 2005 (1 ticket from Oregon)10. $338.3 million, Powerball, March 23, 2013 (1 ticket from New Jersey) She noted that both games are now sold side by side, as part of a 2010 licensing agreement, in 43 states, plus the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands. 'It's great to have both games available to players and to have drawings four nights a week. I think that the two games complement each other,' Otto said. The Iowa-based Multi-State Lottery Association is operated by 33 state lotteries that help oversee Powerball. Mega Millions has no central office and is run by individual state lotteries that handle their own accounting matters. 'I applaud them for looking at changes,' said Iowa Lottery CEO Terry Rich. 'You need to revise, you need to refresh. Any good, big company knows that you need to revitalize your product.' Here are some things to keep in mind ahead of Wednesday night's Powerball jackpot drawing. 1. THE ODDS . Remember, a person's odds of winning the jackpot are 1 in 175 million. That's how many combinations are possible with the game's five white balls and one red ball. In this case, there have been 11 drawings since August 10 without a winner. 2. BIG JACKPOTS . A major revamp in January 2012 increased the cost of a Powerball ticket from $1 to $2. It also led to larger jackpots in smaller amounts of time. Of the top 10 Powerball jackpots of all time, nearly half have been recorded after the game change. 3. CONSOLATION PRIZE . Since the revamp, a secondary $1 million prize has made some losers happy anyway. More than 730 people have won $1 million, and more than 120 people have won $2 million through the Power Play option. 4. WHY WAIT FOR THE HYPE? There's technically no need to wait for a larger jackpot. Whether the jackpot is $40 million or $400 million, your odds of winning the top prize are the same. Whether you buy 1 ticket or 10 tickets, your odds are pretty much the same. A higher jackpot just means there's a higher chance there will be more than one winning ticket. 5. SOMEONE IS GOING TO WIN . The chance of a person's combination being selected remains astronomically high, though the chance that some set of six numbers will be selected is 1. That means even though your chances of winning are slim, the chances that someone else will win are high. Ronald Wasserstein, executive director of the American Statistical Association, said that's what makes people think it could be them. When it's probably not. 6. AGAIN, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WIN . Remember, you're probably not going to win. Wasserstein said it's hard for people to grasp how small their chances actually are, since no one can really see 175 million of anything. Wasserstein tries to break it down. Take 175 million one-dollar bills and lay them out. Pick one lucky dollar bill that will win you all $175 million. You can line up those dollar bills twice along the edges of the continental United States. Or you can cover 380 football fields. Imagine picking the one lucky dollar bill from those fields, and that's your chance of winning the Powerball jackpot on a single ticket.","Mega Millions is also changing its rules to create less huge wins and more smaller, but still hefty prizes ."

An escaped convict will be questioned over a string of robberies after being given day release from prison - less than half way into his eighteen year stretch. Nicholas Overton, 35, who was locked away over a string of armed robberies in 2006, escaped a month ago. He had been released for the day from HMP Thorn Cross in Warrington, Cheshire - only to fail to return, sparking a nationwide manhunt. Today police recaptured fugitive Overton, from Sheffield, South Yorkshire in a dawn swoop on a house in Crewe following a 28 day manhunt. He will now be quizzed over a knifepoint robbery at a Coop store in Haslington, near Crewe carried out just days after he was reported missing by prison bosses. Officers are also looking into the possibility the raid was linked to other robberies at a nearby off licence and others shops in the Macclesfield area. A 38-year-old woman was arrested on harbouring an escaped prisoner. Enquiries are continuing. A row has broken out over Overton's escape which occurred on August 22. A friend of a shopworker who was held up at gunpoint by Overton during his last crime spree said: 'It's disgraceful - what was he doing out of prison.' Overton had received an 18-year sentence at Sheffield Crown Court in 2006 for 23 gunpoint robberies carried out upon shops across five counties over a two-month period. Overton had received an 18-year sentence at Sheffield Crown Court in 2006 for 23 gunpoint robberies carried out upon shops across five counties over a two-month period . It was not known why Overton had been granted day release. Cheshire Police said the knifepoint robbery occurred at 8.44pm on September 12 at the Co-Op in Crewe Road. A man entered the store and selected a pint of milk before approaching the counter and handing the cashier a £1 coin. As the shop assistant opened the till he produced a 6 inch knife and leaned over the counter to take cash from the till. The shop assistant attempted to stop the man from taking the money, but the offender escaped with a quantity of cash. A blue green Audi A6 which has the registration plate V990 DBB was seen in the area at the time and Overton is being linked to the vehicle. A Prison Service spokesman said: 'Release on temporary licence is used to prepare prisoners for their eventual release from custody. 'We fully support the police in their investigation and we are examining the circumstances of this case to identify any lessons that can be learned.'

The increase in speed will come from improvements to the satellites and the ground-based towers that Gogo uses to create the connectivity. A new antenna, which is installed on aircraft, will also be twice as efficient and half the size of the one currently on planes. Rollout: Initially the super-fast wi-fi in the sky will be available on Virgin America, but other airlines will likely follow . Virgin America will be the first to use Gogo's GTO service. The company is planning to talk to other partners which include American Airlines, Delta and United. JetBlue is also planning to introduce its wi-fi service but using ViaSat which is a competing company. Gogo also offers its own video service on board aircraft. No prices for the new service have been announced yet. Gogo currently charges $15 for three hours of browsing on some flights.","Gogo is the largest provider of in-flight Internet in the U.S.
New system will use a combination of satellites and cellular towers to connect airplanes to the Web at speeds six times faster than currently .
Surfing in the air will be at least as fast as average speeds on the ground .

A Pizza Express chef’s good turn cost him his life when he was stabbed to death in an unprovoked attack by a Polish migrant worker, a court heard today. Mark Blades, who was described as a 'gentle and decent man', should have been at home at the night he was brutally stabbed, but had agreed to work extra hours to help out a sick colleague. The 29-year-old had just finished a 12-hour shift when he stepped into a rear service area of the Nottingham restaurant for a cigarette. Mark Blades, 29, was killed by kitchen porter Marcin Cwiakalo, 21, right, after working late to help a friend . But he was confronted by total stranger Marcin Cwiakalo, a kitchen porter at a nearby restaurant in Nottingham city centre, and stabbed in a 'random and motiveless' attack on June 20 last year. CCTV footage played to Nottingham Crown Court showed Cwiakalo, 21, grabbing and dragging Mr Blades before lunging at him with a large kitchen knife. Mr Blades, who police said was simply 'in the wrong place at the wrong time', suffered three deep knife wounds to vital organs and died at the scene. The hearing was told paranoid schizophrenic Cwiakalo then fled, running to a nearby Tesco store where he was detained by security staff after swigging vodka he had taken from a shelf. He was taken to hospital before being charged with murder. Neil Moore, prosecuting, said Mr Blades had been due to work a 10am to 7pm shift but had agreed to work extra hours to cover for a colleague who had called in sick. He was attacked at around 10.20pm. The court heard Cwiakalo, of Radford, Nottingham, had first come to the UK in 2010. A week before the killing, he had landed a job as a kitchen porter at Frankie and Benny’s restaurant next door to the Pizza Express where Mr Blades worked. Mark Blades worked as a chef at this Pizza Express in Nottingham and was killed after finishing a long shift . Mr Blades, pictured here with his long-time girlfriend Ella Wolstencroft, had talked to her about marriage . Mr Moore told the court Cwiakalo was due to work an 8pm to 11pm shift, but was asked by his boss to leave halfway through because of his 'weird, strange and creepy behaviour'. Mr Moore said he had refused to wear his Frankie and Benny’s top and had appeared 'spaced out as in some sort of a trance'. A manager called the police at around 9.30pm after Cwiakalo refused to leave, and he was escorted from the restaurant. But after the officers left, he returned and entered via a rear entrance, taking a knife from the kitchen. His boss followed him outside and saw him hiding the knife behind his back while 'grinning evilly' but in a 'calm and relaxed' manner. She retreated inside and called the police again. But the two restaurants shared the same rear service area, and at around 10.20pm Mr Blades, who lived in Nottingham but was originally from Stewarton, Ayrshire, was stabbed after he stepped out for a cigarette break. He was left lying in a pool of blood. The man who killed Mr Blades worked in this branch of Frankie & Benny's restaurant near the Pizza Express . The court heard Cwiakalo had no convictions in the UK, but had been given a community penalty in his native Poland a year before the killing for possession of cannabis. British Police learned that shortly before he left Poland, he had been arrested after he was seen hitting a wall with an axe and a hammer. However, he wasn’t prosecuted. 'This was a random, senseless, motiveless and violent knife attack when all Mr Blades was doing was having a cigarette break' - Judge Nigel Godsmark, QC . Psychiatrists diagnosed Cwiakalo with paranoid schizophrenia. He told doctors that a year before he stabbed Mr Blades, he had started to suffer from delusions that he was living inside a television set and playing a role in a TV show in which there were black and white zones. The black zone was populated by 'evil people' who he felt compelled to kill. Doctors noted they had rarely come across such a 'well-behaved' paranoid as Cwiakalo. Stephen Gosnell, defending, said Cwiakalo was 'bitterly sorry' for what he had done. He claimed he couldn’t remember killing Mr Blades, but when shown CCTV of the attack, he was 'appalled and disgusted' by his actions, and asked for his 'sincere apologies' to be passed to Mr Blades’ family and friends. The court heard Mr Blades’ family were still too upset to attend court. In an impact statement Ella Wolstencroft, 27, Mr Blades’ partner of 12 years, described him as a 'gentle and funny person who cared for everyone he met.' She added: 'He was a very humble man, loved and respected by all, despised rude behaviour and was committed to his work.' Judge Nigel Godsmark QC, sentencing, described Mr Blades as a 'gentle, good-humoured, hard-working and decent man' who was liked by his colleagues and friends, and loved by his family and long-term partner. 'Mark was a funny, kind, gentle buy with lots of friends... We had talked about marriage but we thought we had plenty of time.' - Ella Wolstencroft, 27, Mr Blades' girlfriend . He added: 'This was a random, senseless, motiveless and violent knife attack on Mr Blades, when all he was doing was having a cigarette break.' He told Cwiakalo, who denied murder but admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility, he had 'uprooted forever' the lives of those closest to Mr Blades. Judge Godsmark ruled that he should be held indefinitely at Rampton top security hospital. He added that should there come a time that Cwiakalo was diagnosed as being cured of his condition, he should serve a minimum jail sentence of 20 years. Mr Blades had been with Miss Wolstencroft since high school, and they moved to Nottingham in 2009. Miss Wolstencroft said after the case: 'Mark loved his job and worked hard at it. He was your typical chef, a perfectionist who knew exactly what he wanted and made sure he got it. 'He was a funny, kind, gentle guy, with lots of friends. He was the kind of guy who would wake up singing in the morning - he was always so happy for his life.' 'Mark and I had talked about marriage, but we thought we had plenty of time' She added: 'That night, Mark had just finished his shift and had called me to say he’d be home soon. He wasn’t supposed to be there. He’d finished three hours earlier but had stayed late to help out. That’s the kind of person he was. 'The next thing I know I get a phone call from a friend at the restaurant saying I needed to get there, that Mark had been hurt. 'He never came home.'","Mark Blades, 29, had worked a 12-hour shift at Nottingham pizza restaurant .

"By . Ellie Buchdahl . PUBLISHED: . 11:43 EST, 18 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:05 EST, 19 September 2013 . Loving husband: Army Major Steve Cadywould tried to support his wife Emma . The wife of an Army Major became severely depressed after the birth of her son and threw herself underneath a 100mph train, a coroner heard today. Emma Cadywould had been struggling to cope after a series of sleepless nights in the six months since the birth of baby Harrison. The 32-year-old - known to her friends as Emsie - was supported by her husband, Major Steve Cadywould, and their extended family, but could not adjust to her new life. The inquest at Salisbury, Wiltshire, heard how the baby would wake up to 20 times a night. Mrs Cadywould suffered a breakdown and began to lose her hair. She regularly told loved ones she wanted to be at peace and expressed suicidal thoughts as her life spiralled out of control. Despite contact with the community mental health team and being prescribed anti-depressant medication, she decided to end her life. On the day she killed herself, Major . Cadywould had breakfast with his wife and she dressed their baby and . later drove him to nursery. They had discussed 'normal domestic' issues, but there was nothing out of the ordinary. Major . Cadywould, who had been taking military commander exams in the days . leading to his wife’s death, said: 'I believe she took care to conceal . it (her suicidal thoughts) from me. 'She didn’t even tell me about the way she was feeling so I was unaware she had those thoughts. Postnatal depression: Mrs Cadywould had been struggling to cope with Harrison, who sometimes woke 20 times a night . 'She didn’t talk to me about thinking about harming herself.' The . University of Bristol researcher for the department of East Asian . studies was later killed at a junction near Swindon, Wiltshire, on December 16, 2011. Train . driver Christopher Woodley was in the cab of the train from London Paddington to Bristol Temple Meads when he . heard a 'loud bang' while going over a bridge at a speed of approximately 105mph, he said in his statement. He . added that the sun had been very bright shining into the car and it was . difficult to see, even though he was wearing sunglasses. The . coroner was told that Mr Woodley slowed to 50mph, believing it was a . deer hitting the train, which was not uncommon incident in that area. He . continued the journey a few minutes more into a station where he . got out and saw a small amount of blood on the coupling iron. The . nose end door had been pushed in and there was damage to the front . bodywork, but he said there was nothing to indicate that the train might . have struck a person. Mrs Cadywould's body was later discovered by officers from British Transport Police at the impact spot. Mrs . Cadywould, of Saxon Orchard, Watchfield, Swindon, was found . to have died from 'multiple injuries from an impact,' a post-mortem . examination found. Toxicology results showed prescription anti-depressants in her bloodstream. Beautiful: Emma's family paid tribute to a beloved sister, daughter and wife with a 'wicked sense of humour' Today Major Cadywould, 36, told how difficult his wife had found the weeks after Harrison's birth at Great Western Hospital in Swindon. 'It was a rapid ejection after the birth. We left after four hours. It was made clear to us at the beginning that they have a quick turnaround,' he said. 'I think it was quite a shock - the whole process.' He added: 'As time elapsed Harrison was difficult to get into a routine. 'The whole night from day, day from night, feeding. There was no routine. She found that very difficult with broken sleep. 'He was a very fretful baby. He would wake 10 to 20 times in the night. Sometimes there would be 20 minutes between his waking.' 'Post-natal depression is a silent killer. As a family, we will always keep our memories of our wonderful Emsie alive.' Lucie, Emma Cadywould's sister . Both took it in turns to look after Harrison but his father began to take further responsibility when his wife couldn’t cope. 'There was a sudden change,' he said. 'The first time the crisis team arrived and Emma went to stay with her parents. 'I then went to take over full time responsibility of Harrison. I think it had come to a point she could no longer cope. 'Physically she was OK, but mentally she wasn’t coping. She suffered some hair loss late on.' He went on: 'We had asked the crisis team about going to hospital but were told in these situations that the preferable course of action was to be with the family.' Mrs Cadywould later spent a period of 11 days with the community mental health team in October 2011, the hearing was told. The couple were married in December 2007 and Harrison was born on June 1, 2011. Harrison interacted well at nursery but found it hard to settle at home, the hearing was told. Paying tribute to her on a fundraising website, sister Lucie said: 'My only sister Emma was tragically lost by all who loved and cherished her, due to an illness which is wildly unacknowledged or taken less seriously than it should be. Unsure: Despite being fun-loving, Mrs Cadywould's family said she lacked confidence and motivation . 'Since we lost Emma we have become aware of some astonishing and desperately sad statistics. In the UK, one mother a week will be totally overwhelmed by post natal depression and will tragically be lost to a loving family. 'Post-natal depression is a silent killer. As a family, we will always keep our memories of our wonderful Emsie alive. 'My nephew Harrison is an accolade to my sister and the wonderful mummy she was to him.' Mrs Cadywould's mother, Janet Holland, told the inquest her daughter struggled as a new parent. 'She said she was unsure if she could be a mum,' said Mrs Holland. 'I did not like the way she was feeling. In short she wanted her old life back. A life where she had regular sleep and she could do what she wanted before having Harrison. She was a light sleeper and the lack of sleep was a major factor in her problems. 'She continued to receive support from her family but she seemed unaware she was suffering from some sort of depression.She lacked motivation, self esteem and confidence. 'She wanted a natural birth, which she had. She was discharged four hours after giving birth. 'It was her first baby and she had to leave the hospital so soon after having the first baby was traumatic for her.' Mrs Holland, who confirmed her daughter had had a trouble-free pregnancy, went on: 'I saw quite a lot of her latterly as she wasn't coping well. The first few months I was unaware there was anything wrong.' She said her daughter had texted her after three months asking for help because she was struggling. 'She had been receiving plenty of support from Steve, his mother, as well as her family,' Mrs Holland said. 'When I got to the house she was pacing up and down and seemed unable to cope. She was saying irrational things like: ""Take me away. Take the baby away.""' Mrs Holland said her daughter had begun counselling sessions with psychologist Dr Kola Ige in October, who said he believed she would improve by Christmas told me that we would see an improvement by Christmas. Mrs Holland told how her daughter began losing her hair after her breakdown and later decided to have her hair cut short.She said her daughter told her she had three options in life: 'One, to stay at home with Steve and Harrison; two, to leave Steve and Harrison and return to live here; or three, not to be here and be at peace. 'She wanted our approval to let her go,' Mrs Holland added. Concerns: Husband Steve said his wife had sought help from professionals for her depression . 'I last saw her the day before she died. I came home from work. All she wanted me to do was to hold her and cuddle her. 'On the morning of her death I missed a call from her as I was driving. I rang her back immediately but she did not answer. I received a text saying she was driving Harrison to nursery and would then be going home. 'Later that day I received news of her death from Steve and had a visit from police officers.' Mrs Holland said that from the day she had her breakdown, her daughter was talking about 'not being here' in mid-October. Paying tribute to her daughter, she told the inquest: 'We would like to acknowledge Emma for being the young woman she was before her life ended so tragically. 'Emma was beautiful and intelligent and enjoyed life to the full. She had a wicked sense of humour and would always make you laugh. 'Emma worked hard and achieved a great deal in her 32 years. She loved her family and was a wonderful daughter, sister and mum. She was loving, kind caring and thoughtful. 'Emma was honest and straightforward, would speak her own mind and always say things exactly as it was and everyone admired her for this.' The inquest - expected to last three days - continues.

A little girl who lost both of her feet after he father accidentally ran over her with a lawn mower has celebrated a happy milestone in her young life by having a princess party for her third birthday. Ireland Nugent, who opted quickly for a Spiderman costume instead of a princess outfit, had to have her feet amputated following the April 11 accident, and now she is learning how to walk using prosthetic limbs. 'It's just not her birthday to us, it's just a celebration of being here,' her mother Nicole said to The Tampa Bay Times. Birthday girl: Ireland Nugent, seen here with her cousin, celebrated her third birthday on Sunday, months after she had both her her feet amputated due to a lawn mower accident . Memorable moment: The birthday was a highlight for the Nugent family who has had a particularly tough year . 'I think this is a day we will never forget.' While the attention was focused on the celebration of her birthday this weekend- which included a princess-themed party- her health battles are far from over. The Tampa Bay Times reports that on Thursday she will go under the knife with another surgery as doctors have to shave down a portion of her right leg. Such a surgery may become a regular occurrence as they need to constantly adjust based on her growth. Ireland apparently doesn't enjoy wearing her prosthetic limbs, saying that they hurt, but it doesn't hold her back as she moves around freely without the aides like she did at her Sunday birthday party. Embracing the new: Ireland is said to be doing very well with her prosthetic legs, though she opts not to wear them sometimes because they hurt slightly . Different ways of getting around: The accident left her both knees but nothing below . Her recovery following the April accident when her father ran after Jerry as he rode a lawn mower up the driveway at their Palm Harbor home. Her mother, Nicole Nugent, frantically motioned for him to stop, but he misunderstood, put the lawn mower in reverse and backed over the child. The toddler's legs were severed below the knees and she had cuts to her hand. She also broke her thumb. Experts were worried that the little girl might refuse to walk with her new prosthetic limbs, but the Tampa Bay Times reported that the girl has already become emotionally attached to the legs. Days out: The little girl has embraced the changes in her abilities but will undergo more surgeries moving forward including one this week . Community effort: Supporters have raised $150,000 so far to help pay for her medical expenses . When the prosthetist said he would need the test limbs back during a June fitting, the little girl said she wanted to keep them. The shocking case garnered national attention and photos of Ireland's bright smile warmed the hearts of thousands who followed her progress. All told, $150,000 has been donated to the family in order to help pay for her medical bills. 'She will continue to succeed. She will do great things in her life,' her mother Nicole told reporters at a press conference in April. 'This will not stop Ireland.' When she took her first post-operation steps in June, her father was brimming with pride after there were initial fears she may reject the prosthetics. 'She took it over the top ... She's not ever going to hold back,' he said. 'That's my superhero. That's my angel.' Brave: Ireland walked on her prosthetic legs for the first time in June .

Former IRA commander Martin McGuinness has described the death of two boys killed by one of the terror group's bombs as 'shameful' during a peace lecture in the town where it happened. Three-year-old Johnathan Ball and 12-year-old Tim Parry were both killed by bombs planted by the IRA in Warrington on March 20, 1993. Mr McGuinness yesterday visited the town after being invited by Tim Parry's father to speak at a peace foundation named in his son's memory. Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness described the deaths of IRA bomb victims Tim Parry and Johnathan Ball as 'shamful' during a talk at the Peace Centre in Warrington . Victims: Tim Parry, 12, (left) and three-year-old Johnathan Ball (right) were both killed by the Warrington bombs . A small band of around 12 demonstrators . stood outside the venue last night protesting at Mr McGuinness' speech . at the Tim Parry - Johnathan Ball Foundation for Peace. Julie Hambleton, whose sister Maxine, . 18, was killed in the Birmingham pub bombings, compared Mr McGuinness' giving a talk on peace to 'asking Myra Hindley to give a talk on child . protection'. Before the speech, Mr McGuinness said that he 'understood' the objections and described the path to peace as a 'journey'. 'My heart goes out to them because they . too are people that have suffered as a result of the conflict in the . north of Ireland,' he said. 'I fully appreciate that there are other people who don't feel able to make that journey. I would be the last to criticise them. 'My heart goes out to all the victims of the conflict. I feel very compassionate to all of them. 'We need to be sorry for everything that happened with the people involved in the conflict.' Mr McGuinness was invited to speak at the centre by Tim Parry's father, Colin, pictured left with the minister . Meeting: Colin Parry, pictured left with his wife Wendy and Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness, said that history is littered with terrorists who went on to become peace-makers . Martin McGuinness has gone from former IRA second in command to mainstream politician who shook hands with the Queen. Born in 1950, he joined the Provisional IRA as a teenager and quickly rose up the ranks. By 1971, aged 21, he was second in command of the IRA in Derry. He held that position at the time of Bloody Sunday, when 14 civil rights protesters were killed by British paratroopers in the city. During the Saville Inquiry into the events of that day, Paddy Ward claimed McGuinness had personally handed him bomb parts, an allegation McGuinness claimed was 'fantasy'. In 1973, he was convicted by Ireland's Special Criminal Court, after being caught with a car  loaded with explosives and ammunition. He refused to recognise the court, and was sentenced to six months imprisonment. He has also been accused of attending the interrogation of British government informer Frank Hegarty, whom he allegedly encouraged to return to Derry where he was murdered. He has always denied those allegations. However, he has never denied his role in the IRA, and has said: ‘I didn’t say I never fired a gun – I was in the IRA. There were battles on the streets of Derry.' However, when asked if he had killed anyone, he answered no. He claims he left the Provisionals in 1974 to pursue a career in politics. As a member of Sinn Fein, he was elected to Parliament at Westminster in 1997 - although he never took up his seat. He was the political party's chief negotiator when the Good Friday Agreement was signed in 1998 and was later Education Minister after the Northern Ireland Assembly was set-up. Since 2007 he has been the deputy first minister. In 2012, he shook hands with the Queen almost 33 years after her cousin, Lord Mountbatten of Burma, was murdered by an IRA bomb. The gesture of mutual acceptance and acknowledgement was an astonishing act of forgiveness by the 86-year-old monarch who adored her ‘Uncle Dickie’. During his speech, McGuinness told of his own and Ulster's journey to peace and his hopes for the future, adding: 'I was once in the IRA. I am now a peace builder. It has been a journey which has involved much hurt and pain. 'I have followed many coffins and stood beside many grieving families in the years since. 'But there can be no greater tragedy in life than parents having to bury their child.' He added: 'Regrettably the past cannot be changed or undone. Neither can the suffering, the hurt or the violence of the conflict be disowned by Republicans or any other party to the conflict.' Mr Parry said while he has not forgiven . the IRA for the bombing, history was 'littered' with terrorists who had . now become peace-makers. He added that the foundation had an 'open door' policy and their founding principle was that all opinions from opposing sides of conflicts were welcome in the pursuit of peace. 'I would hope that the people outside, rather than criticise us for that, would recognise that's a different path but an honourable path,' he said. Tim and Johnathan were killed when bombs planted in litter bins in the town's main shopping area were detonated shortly after midday on a sunny Saturday afternoon. No warning was given and no one has been prosecuted for the attack on March 20 1993, that left 56 people injured. Johnathan, three, was in the town with his babysitter to buy a card for Mother's Day, the next day, when he was killed. Tim, . an Everton fan, had been shopping for football shorts when he caught . the full force of the explosion. He died in his father's arms five days . later in Liverpool's Walton Hospital. The death of the two boys sparked a public outcry in the UK and on both sides of the border in Ireland. Mr . Parry and Tim's mother, Wendy Parry, have set up the Tim Parry . Johnathan Ball Foundation for Peace, which has since become an . internationally recognised centre for conflict resolution and victim . support. One of the protesters outside the . venue was Brian Hambleton, 58, who dropped off his sister Maxine at the . Birmingham pub blasted by IRA bombs on the evening of November 21, 1974. Mr Hambleton, from Birmingham, said: 'It makes me feel ill being within 100 yards of him. I'm here for a reason and that reason is that man's murky, violent past. 'He has to be answerable for his past before he goes forward with peace. He shouldn't be speaking in there, he should be on his knees begging people's forgiveness. 'This . town lost two beautiful young boys like I lost my sister. How Mr Parry . can greet him and invite him here is beyond me. It is immoral.'

A homeless man who returned a backpack containing $40,000 in cash and travelers checks has been rewarded by well-wishers who have donated more than $75,000 to help him. Former Boston courthouse employee Glen James had fallen on hard times, but said he would not have tried to keep any of the money he found at the weekend. After hearing about his story a Virginia man set up a GoFundMe website which has raised thousands to help Mr James in just one day. Scroll down for video . Life-changing: Ethan Whittington, left, has helped raise more than $75,000 to help Good Samaritan Glen James . 'It started with wanting to help a . someone in a small way, and now we can help them in a large way,' Ethan . Whittington, who set up the site, said. After reading about Mr James's good deed, the 27-year-old started the donation page on Monday afternoon. The accounts manager had initially intended to raise $50,000 but that goal was achieved within a day of the site going live. As more people heard of Mr James's story, more money rolled in, with a further $15,000 being raised in just a few hours on Wednesday. 'It's a good amount of money to get your feet off the ground,' Mr Whittington told the Boston Globe. 'We’ve all been in that situation when we’ve lost something.' He spoke to Mr James for the first time yesterday and is planning to travel to Boston to meet him and discuss the best way for him to use the money. On an update on . the donation site, Mr Whittington said: 'Donations just keep pouring . in. I have had people willing to donate computers, clothes, food, etc. I . am also speaking with a few folks about the possibility of a house or . apartment.' The initial fundraising goal has been raised from $50,000 to $250,000 in the hope that it can be used to buy Mr James a house and get him back on his feet. He added that all the money will be handed to Mr James, who is said to be overwhelmed by the support and keen for advice on how to make the best use of the fund. The homeless man, who stays at a shelter in the city, said he has been offered so much money on the street this week that he has finally been able to open a bank account. Glen James was honored by Boston Police Commissioner Edward Davis on Monday and thanked for an 'extraordinary show of character and honesty' The backpack found by Mr James contained $2,400 in cash and $39,500 in American Express Travelers Cheques, plus Chinese passports and other personal papers . Mr Whittington said that Mr James was concerned about the publicity surrounding the money being offered to him however. When . he handed in the bag Mr James, who has been homeless since 2005, said . even if he were desperate he wouldn't have kept ‘even a penny.’ He . was honored by Boston Police Commissioner Edward Davis on Monday and . given a special citation and thanked for an ‘extraordinary show of . character and honesty.’ Mr James found the backpack at the South Bay Mall in the city's Dorchester neighborhood on Saturday evening. He . flagged down a police officer and handed it over. Inside the backpack . was $2,400 in U.S. currency, almost $40,000 in traveler's checks, . Chinese passports and other personal papers. Overwhelmed: Glen James has become the center of attention since carrying out a good deed at the weekend . The man who lost it told workers at a nearby Best Buy store at the mall and they called police. Officers then brought the backpack's owner to a nearby police station and returned his property after confirming it belonged to him. Authorities said that the backpack's owner didn't want his identity made public, but that he was a Chinese student who was visiting another student in Boston. Mr James's story is similar to that of a homeless man in Kansas City, Missouri, who received more than $175,000 in donations after he returned a diamond engagement ring to its rightful owner in February. Sarah Darling and her husband were so taken with Billy Ray Harris' act of kindness that they set up an online fundraising page on giveforward.com which raised more than $175,000 for the homeless man who had regularly been sleeping under a bridge. Publicity around Mr Harris's change of fortune also helped him reconnect with his estranged family in Texas, where he was originally from. Earlier in the week a police spokeswoman said Mr James, who didn't give his age, is staying at a city homeless shelter and that many people had expressed interest in helping him since hearing about his good deed. The Good Samaritan said in his . statement that he worked as a file clerk in the Boston municipal court . system for 13 years, but lost his job and became homeless after problems . with his boss. Mr James said it would be difficult for him . to hold down a job because he suffers from Meniere's disease, which the . Mayo Clinic describes as an inner ear disorder that causes episodes of . vertigo. An employee from the Dorchester Best Buy, seen here, contacted police and told them a customer had reported missing a backpack containing a 'large sum of money' He said he didn't want to be a burden to his relatives and that people at the shelter helped him.  Mr James gets food stamps and panhandles to make money to do laundry, to pay for transportation and buy other ‘odds and ends,’ he said. On Monday, he also thanked the strangers who have given him spare change on the street. ‘It's just nice to have some money in one's pocket so that as a homeless man I don't feel absolutely broke all the time,’ he said.","Accounts manager sets up fund to help Boston man he has never met .

A devastated mother has confronted her son-in-law in court as he finally goes on trial for allegedly strangling her daughter six years after she was found dead. Gael Schneider unleashed an emotional rant when she came face-to-face with David Pietz in court in King County, Washington on Monday. 'I've cried my brains out every day for . seven years,' Mrs Schneider said. 'If he can't take being confronted by a 72-year-old . woman, he's not much of a man.' She added that she had long suspected her son-in-law was responsible for the death of her daughter, Nicole Pietz, 32, who vanished from her home in Renton in 2006. Scroll down for video . Emotional: Gael Schneider unleashed an emotional rant when she came face-to-face with her daughter's alleged killer - her son-in-law - in court, six years after her daughter was murdered . Her husband reported her missing before appearing in television interviews pleading for information, but her strangled body was found by a walker in a wooded area nearly two weeks later. 'I just said he murdered my daughter,' Schneider recounted, ABC News reported. But for years, there were no charges brought in connection with the murder - until police arrested Pietz, 34, last year and charged him with second-degree murder after advances in technology. Detectives were initially interested in Pietz as a suspect after learning that he was unhappy in the marriage and had allegedly cheated on her and asked her to engage in a threesome. Now they say they have built a case on circumstantial evidence - and in court they played the 911 call in which he reported her missing. His voice is quiet, calm, and matter of fact, King5 reported. Pietz, who had been married to his wife for four years, was finally arrested earlier in March 2012 after DNA and phone GPS linked him to the scene, police said. Killed: Nicole Pietz, 32, was found dead in February 2006. She is pictured with her husband, David Pietz . Cowering: Martin David Pietz could hardly look at his mother-in-law as she faced him in court in Seattle . Investigators claimed there were contradictions in his statements and he failed a lie detector test before refusing to undergo a second. Mr . Pietz told police that on January 27 he got home from work around . midnight and briefly said goodnight to his wife, who was already . sleeping, KOMO reported after his arrest. The next morning he said left for work at 8.30am without speaking to Nicole and had no contact with her throughout the day. Mr . Pietz told police that he called 911 when he went straight to a planned . dinner with friends that night and his wife never arrived. He claims that she must vanished as she headed to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting that morning where she was going to celebrate 8 years of sobriety. He claimed that he believed she had fallen back into her old drug habit. Scene: Her body was found in a wooded area in 2006. Police said evidence suggested she had been killed at night - not in the day as Pietz suggested - as she still had her night mouth guard in . Cover? in 2006, Pietz had appeared on television beside Schneider pleading for information in the case . However, police said that forensic tests - including undigested food in her stomach - showed that Mrs Pietz had been killed around midnight on January 27. When her body was found, she was wearing a mouth guard she only wore at night and her wedding ring was in cleaning solution in the bathroom; friends said she only took it off at night to clean it. Phone records also show her phone was allegedly used at her husband's workplace. And . DNA evidence showed that Mr Pietz's was the last person to drive her . car, which was found two weeks after her body in a parking lot near the . University of Washington . In court, Nicole's mother, Mrs Schneider. added that she remembered her son-in-law acting strangely at the funeral. 'He put his arms around me and said, ""I didn't think you'd take it so hard"",' she told the court. Loss: Investigators believe the couple was having marital problems and that Mr Pietz had cheated on his wife . But defense attorneys have argued that their case is weak and that there were no eyewitnesses. 'It's not based on any direct evidence, and it's not going to show that David Pietz took Nicole's life,' Pietz's defense attorney Cooper Offenbecher said, ABC News reported. After his arrest, she told KOMO that it was a huge relief. 'I can't even tell you, I'm so elated. My stomach was just like it has bees in it. And [I was] thanking God over and over and over for finally granting this prayer to me.' The mother said knowing her daughter's killer was free was 'absolute hell'. See below for video .

"By . Sophie Borland . PUBLISHED: . 19:21 EST, 18 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:50 EST, 19 September 2013 . As well as the training scheme, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt will today announce plans to turn around the country's most failed hospitals . The brightest doctors could be sent to Harvard and trained-up to take over failing hospitals under proposals to be unveiled by the health secretary. Jeremy Hunt wants 50 of the best doctors - as well as some senior nurses and businessmen - to be sent on a fast-track course to turn them into top NHS managers. Mr Hunt is concerned that there is presently a glut of ‘mediocre’ managers in the health service with many of them being paid six-figure sums to run failing organisations. Earlier this year it emerged that the hospital boss who presided over the worst scandal in the history of the NHS had been given the £100,000 a year job despite having no previous managerial experience. Martin Yeates - who presided over Mid Staffordshire NHS trust when hundreds of patients died from neglect - was appointed in 2005 because there were no other suitable candidates. Other health experts have warned that this lack of talent means hospitals have no choice but to appoint poor managers into highly paid roles. This has led to a ‘revolving door’ scenario with bosses moving between hospitals every two or three years . earning ever higher salaries despite failing to improve care. Mr Hunt - along with other health professionals - believes that doctors and nurses are far better placed to run hospitals than managers with no medical experience. Under the proposals to be announced today, a total of £10 million will be invested into the ten-month scheme that will start next Spring. It is likely to involve eight weeks of leadership training at the prestigious Harvard University, in Boston, USA, although this is still under negotiation. Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust oversaw a failure in care which lead to the deaths of many patients . It will also include four weeks of classroom training in the UK, six months at a top NHS hospital and a one-month placement in a major company such as Microsoft or BP. The recruits will not get any formal qualification although they will be guaranteed a senior position on the board of a hospital - most likely one that is currently failing. Mr Hunt said: ‘If we want this country to be a world-leader, we need a world-leading health service led by the very brightest and best, so I am ambitious about seeking out fresh talent wherever we can find it. ‘Mediocre management and lack of clinical leadership were key contributors to the tragedy at Mid Staffs. 'We are determined to learn that lesson, and train strong leaders drive up standards across the NHS through this cutting-edge programme.’ The doctors and other staff will have to serve at least two years as top NHS managers before leaving to work in the private sector - where pay is far higher. Professor John Ashton, president of the Faculty of Public Health said: ‘There’s currently a real lack of managers who have done any clinical training. ‘They are very process-driven and it’s all about bed-waits, winter pressures and not whether the health of people has actually improved. ‘What the Government is proposing isn’t new it’s just an extension of what’s already happening. Doctors already occupy senior management roles.' As well as the 50 NHS doctors, other notable graduates of Harvard include current US President Barack Obama, modernist author T.S. Eliot and Hollywood actor Tommy Lee Jones . But Labour said it was a mistake spending millions sending doctors to the US when so many hospitals were so short-staffed. Jamie Reed MP, Labour’s shadow health minister said: ‘Patients will struggle to understand this decision. ‘When half of all hospital wards in England will be short-staffed tonight, ministers surely can’t think it’s a priority to send NHS managers to train in the United States. ‘This is the wrong priority and further proof you can’t trust the Tories with the NHS.’ Later today the health secretary will explain how he plans to turn-around 11 failing NHS trusts with the worst death rates in the country. Top performing NHS managers are to be drafted in to turn around failing hospitals in a move that  Jeremy Hunt said would lead to 'real change'. The 11 hospitals put in special measures in the wake of the scandal over standards at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust and subsequent Keogh Review will be partnered with the best NHS trusts and managers in a scheme that echoes the 'super-heads' programme to turn around failing schools. One example is George Elliott Hospital in Nuneaton, which has been placed in special measures and is in 'desperate need' of IT improvements. That hospital has been partnered with University Hospitals Birmingham, which Mr Hunt said has one of the best IT systems in the country. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'We are very aware that there are risks, but what's the alternative? 'I think in a situation like this we have a handful of really inspirational leaders and these people are anxious to help us turn around these failing hospitals, they want to play their part'. Trusts including North Cumbria, Tameside, Basildon and Thurrock and United Lincolnshire have all been taken over by hit squads after an inspections earlier this summer unearthed poor care. But six are ‘foundation trusts’ - a coveted status brought in under Labour which was meant to reward the best-performing hospitals.","Special scheme to address lack of managers with clinical training .

A decision to destroy two RAF dogs that guarded Prince William just days after he quit the service has angered animal experts and upset staff on his former base. Brus, a Belgian Shepherd, and Blade, a German Shepherd, were put down on Friday, shortly after the prince completed his final shift as a search and rescue pilot at RAF Valley on Anglesey. Charities said the animals had been disposed of like a piece of worn-out military kit while one animal behaviour expert suggested the decision was ‘a euthanasia of convenience’. The dead dogs were among 288 that the  Ministry of Defence has put down in the last ten years. Protected: Prince William's two RAF guard dogs, Belgium shepherd Brus, pictured right, and German shepherd Blade were destroyed on Friday just a few days after he left the service . Base workers pointed out they had been . very  popular and said animal-lover William – who has a dog of his own – . may also have been shocked by their fate. They were part of a unit brought in to . provide additional security while the second in line to the throne was . based at RAF Valley. A . Ministry of Defence spokesman last night insisted that the decision to . destroy the dogs was ‘entirely coincidental’ and that the animals could . not be rehomed or redeployed because of medical and behavioural issues. But . the decision was the talk of the air base yesterday. One member of . staff said William – who has a spaniel, Lupo – could often be seen . giving the dogs a pat. ‘Everyone is talking about the dogs and people are upset they’ve been put down,’ the staff member said. ‘I . saw William stroke the German Shepherd a few times and made a fuss of . him. They were really popular and William always said hello to all the . handlers.’ Dog lover William, pictured here with pet Lupo, hasn't commented on the death of Brus, (right) who the MoD says became too aggressive . Local resident . Huw Williams, 59, added: ‘I know a few of the lads on the base and I . know the dogs were well liked there. One told me  William would often go . and pat the dogs when he saw them. I bet he will be sad that they . couldn’t have found a safe home.’ Kensington Palace declined to comment yesterday, saying the issue was a matter for the MoD. William . had been based at RAF Valley since 2010. He completed his last flight . as a Sea King pilot nine days ago and has now officially left the . military. Blade and Brus were in a two-dog section set up to patrol the . airbase during the future king’s deployment. They patrolled the station . to protect military personnel, equipment and facilities. But once the . prince left the unit was closed,’ a source said. The . two animals were assessed by a squadron inspector to see if they could . be returned to the Defence Animal Centre, which helps train new . handlers. But they were both deemed unsuitable. Blade, nine and a half, . suffered from osteoarthritis in the hips and had been diagnosed with the . onset of a spinal condition, which is common in German Shepherds of . that age. It was decided he should be destroyed for medical reasons. Brus, . seven and a half, was said to display high levels of stress which . resulted in him ‘self-harming and displaying excessive aggression’. He . was deemed ‘a risk to himself, his handler and others’. Family first: Prince William left the RAF to spend more time with wife Kate and their baby son George . But . animal behaviour expert Dr Roger Mugford commented: ‘Behavioural . problems are often used as a bland excuse for putting dogs to sleep. What you have to do is work hard at making their environment better for . them. It begs the question, would these dogs still be alive if Prince . William was at the base? It sounds sound like a euthanasia of . convenience.’ A spokesman . for the Dogs Trust charity said: ‘Dogs are not pieces of disposable kit . that can be decommissioned at the end of their useful military life. We . fully understand that most service dogs cannot be rehomed as pets. Deployment to another role or retirement to a specialist handler are two . alternative options.’  A spokesman from People for the Ethical . Treatment of Animals said: ‘Dogs are not tools and are not ours to use . and toss away like empty ammunition shells.’ Asked . by the Mail whether both dogs were deemed healthy and fit to work up . until the time they were destroyed despite the issues they were said to . have suffered from, an MoD spokesman said: ‘I don’t think we are in a . position to confirm this.’ An . RAF spokesman said: ‘Whilst security was increased during Prince . William’s tour of RAF Valley, which included the introduction of canine . security patrols, these dogs and with their handlers, were not solely . assigned to HRH The Duke of Cambridge as personal protection. ‘The . timing of their sad demise was purely coincidental. The MoD’s policy is . to re-home all military working dogs at the end of their service life . wherever practicable.  These dogs had a record of veterinary and . behavioural issues which meant that they could not be reassigned to . other duties and they were too aggressive to be kept at home.’","Prince left his role as a search and rescue pilot in North Wales last week .
