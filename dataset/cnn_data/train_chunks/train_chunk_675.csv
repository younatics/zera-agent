The battle against baldness has a space-age new weapon, in the form of a high-tech helmet that promises to help grow your hair back with the aid of lasers. The iGrow Hair Growth System uses low-level laser therapy (LLLT) - 51 low-level red laser and LED lights, which the makers say will help to 're-energise' and strengthen cells in the hair follicles. Scroll down for video . Space age technology: The iGrow Hair Growth System uses low-level laser therapy (LLLT) and promises to give you a new head of hair in nine months . The helmet promises to deliver significant hair re-growth for people suffering from thinning hair and hereditary baldness, as well as other related hair loss conditions. It should be worn for 25 minutes and even comes with headphones and a built-in Ipod and MP3 interface to help you pass the time. The average person using iGrow will apparently first start to see less hair loss after six to eight weeks and the full effect after nine months. The iGrow claims to have no side effects, but a fresh head of hair doesn't come cheap - the iGrow is priced at £665. This does, however, seem more reasonable than a full hair transplant, which can cost between £4,000 - £30,000. Mane attraction: Wayne Rooney famously underwent a hair transplant in 2011, then a second procedure in June this year . Speaking about the futuristic device, Dr Thomy Kouremada-Zioga, hair transplant surgeon at The Private Clinic of Harley Street, said: 'Low level laser therapy (LLLT) is a safe form of light treatment which has long been explored as a potential resolution to genetic forms of hair loss common in men and women, like androgenetic alopecia or pattern balding. 'It is intended for men and women with thinning hair or pattern baldness caused by a hereditary condition, and not by any other form of hair loss. Hair today: The average person will apparently start to see a slowing of hair loss after six to eight weeks and some re-growth after nine months . 'This technology is not particularly new; it is something that has been around for many years in different forms. For example, for many years now I have recommended certain patients (both men and women) use a laser comb, which is a very similar device to the IGrow Hair Growth System. 'A laser comb like this also works with LLLT technology, but is a much smaller device. From the patients I have seen who have gone on to use the system, I can see that it can offer some positive effects when used in conjunction with a product which stimulates hair growth like Regaine. 'However, it is very unlikely that a patient who is losing their hair will see any form of major restoration by using the device. It may cause some of the thin hair on the patient’s head to look slightly thicker and healthier, but the patient is unlikely to see any form of actual re-growth. 'Before investing in a system like this, it is important that the man or woman understands exactly what is causing their hair loss; something which a hair loss specialist will be able to determine. 'Investing in a device like this may offer no long-term solution at all to the patient and it should not be viewed as a viable long-term hair restoration method.' More than 50 per cent of men over the age of 50 will have experienced some form of hair loss.The average number of hairs on a male human head is approximately 100,000 - 150,000.Interestingly, men with fair hair actually normally have more hair on their heads than men with darker hair.Contrary to popular belief, hair loss can effect men of all ages, from their late teens upwards.The average FUE hair transplant procedure takes approximately 8 hours to complete (depending on the number of hairs to be transplanted).","iGrow Hair Growth System costs £665 .

It used to be regarded as a national trait that set the English apart from more emotional nationalities. But the stiff upper lip could be a thing of the past, it was claimed yesterday. The ability of the English to remain stoical and visibly unmoved under pressure has been replaced by a tendency to show off our emotions in public. The outpouring of emotion over the death of Princess Diana and watching footballers such as David Beckham and Paul Gascoigne cry on the pitch has given us licence to display our emotions for all to see, a survey suggested. The research, commissioned by the think tank British Future, asked 2,360 people which qualities summed up the concept of being English, and which were outdated. Fifty-one per cent of those questioned think the stiff upper lip is an ‘outdated stereotype’, while other familiar characteristics - a fondness for queuing, apologising and talking about the weather - are all still well ingrained into the English mind set. Seventy per cent of those polled said the English sense of humour as a national attribute, while the vast majority chose talking about the weather as the most quintessentially English trait. Sixty-nine per cent said the English were happy to queue and wait their turn, and 60 per cent described ‘saying sorry unnecessarily’ was a national trait. British Future, which deals with ‘identity and integration’, commissioned the ICM poll ahead of a Festival of Englishness, which it will co-host with another think tank, the Institute for Public Policy Research, in London this weekend. Sunder Katwala, director of British . Future, said: ‘From Gazza’s tears to the public reaction to Princess . Diana’s death... people are more happy to wear their heart on their . sleeves. 'The Englishness . that we’ve now got is still proud of tradition, such as Shakespeare, but . isn’t as emotionally repressed and buttoned up as it was in the past.’ More than half of those surveyed said that being happy to wait in a queue was an English trait . He continued: ‘This research shows that many of the images of what sums up being English still ring true for most people - that we talk about the weather, are happy to queue and are proud of our distinctive sense of humour, but do say sorry too much. ‘But the English also feel that we have become less buttoned up. ‘After the chilly, stiff upper lip world of Downton Abbey and Brief Encounter, this research shows that we don’t see being emotionally repressed as a valuable part of our national character.’ Mr Kutwala added: ‘We hope to put to bed the equally outdated idea that Englishness is something we can’t really talk about. 'There is much to be proud of in English history and culture, comedy and sport. We need to ditch the idea that Englishness is the one national identity that nobody’s allowed to celebrate.’ The ICM poll, which took the thoughts of more than 2,300 people, also revealed the most popular choices for the best ‘spokesman for England’. Top of the list - which excluded politicians - was the Queen, who was in the top three choice for 57 per cent of respondents. Next was the actor and comedian Stephen Fry with 27 per cent, while the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, was picked by 12 per cent.","A recent survey found attitude is considered 'outdated'

Research found that while standard-class carriages are packed with standing passengers, almost half of first-class seats remain empty . It's a sight guaranteed to infuriate commuters packed like sardines into overcrowded train carriages. With standing room only in standard class, there are rows of empty first-class seats. But this could soon change, following fresh calls to scrap first-class carriages after research indicated many of the premium areas remain half empty in rush hours. Critics insist the comfort of commuters, who pay a high price to stand, should come before the train companies’ quest to maximise profits. The research by a newspaper focused on trains arriving at London stations Paddington, Waterloo, Liverpool Street and King’s Cross between 8am and 9am on three consecutive weekdays.Trains typically had three first-class carriages and five in standard class. Only about 50 per cent of first-class seats were occupied on these trains. Less than a fifth of the first-class carriages were full or nearly full and some had only three or four people in compartments with 48 seats. In almost all cases, passengers were standing in standard-class carriages, which seat 80 people each. All but one of the train operators contacted refused to disclose their own figures on first class or failed to respond. East Coast said its first-class carriages were, on average, 40 per cent full. East Coast said on an average train around 40 per cent of their first-class carriages are unoccupied . Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said: ‘It is sensible to think about the mix of first and standard-class carriages on our railways and it is something we are looking into. 'It is right to ask the question of whether it could deliver a better passenger experience. 'Equally, it is important to be absolutely clear that it is not a solution to the serious capacity issues we face.' Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said it was 'sensible' to consider the difference between how busy easy carriage is . When setting the terms of the train firms’ contracts, the Transport Secretary and his department can specify detailed criteria which must be met if bidders for each new franchise are to be successful. This could include adding more standard-class seats at the expense of first class. Anthony Smith, of independent rail watchdog Passenger Focus, said: ‘A balance needs to be achieved between the number of standard and first-class carriages a train has. ‘It’s clear that where passengers are being squeezed into standard-class carriages while there are plenty of empty seats in first class, this balance is not being achieved.’ A spokesman for consumer watchdog London TravelWatch said: ‘Where there are overcrowded trains and still space in first class, operators should do what they have done in the past and be flexible and change the allocation.’ Government figures released in July showed one in five London-bound commuters have to stand during morning rush hours. The service from Henley-on-Thames to the capital squeezes in nearly double the number of passengers it is designed to carry.","Research found only 50 per cent first-class seats were occupied on rush hour trains to London while passengers were standing in standard-class .

Government borrowing will be £45billion less than expected over the next few years, according to a report out today. The deficit in 2013-14 will be £8billion to £9billion less than the £119.8billion pencilled in by the Chancellor at the Budget in March, it says. After that borrowing will be around £9billion lower than expected every year up to 2017-18 thanks to stronger economic growth, the Ernst & Young Item Club has said. Buoyant: The report from the Ernst & Young Item Club will come as a boost to Chancellor George Osborne . The forecast from the leading economic think-tank will come as a boost to George Osborne ahead of the Autumn Statement on December 4, when he will be able to claim that the outlook is improving. The Office for Budget Responsibility, the independent Treasury watchdog, is expected to back up his claims with vastly improved forecasts for the economy and the public finances. The IMF last week raised its UK growth forecasts for 2013 to 1.4 per cent – double the rate it was expecting in April, when it warned the Chancellor was ‘playing with fire’ be pressing ahead with his austerity plan. In today’s report, the Item Club also raises its growth forecast for this year from 1.1 per cent to 1.4 per cent and for next year from 2.2 per cent to 2.4 per cent. Peter Spencer, chief economic adviser to Item, said: ‘The recovery in the UK now appears to be firmly entrenched.’ He said it has resulted in ‘a marked improvement in the UK’s public finances’. ‘The OBR is likely to upgrade its growth forecast and revise down the borrowing forecast in the upcoming Autumn Statement at the end of the year,’ added Mr Spencer. Road to recovery: The report also predicted that unemployment would fall from 7.7 per cent to 7 per cent . Borrowing hit a record £157.9billion in 2009-10 under Labour, but fell to £115.7billion last year under the Coalition. However, progress has been far slower than expected due to sluggish economic growth. The Item Club now expects growth to pick up to 2.6 per cent in 2015 before easing back to 2.5 per cent in 2017 and 2018. It puts much of the improved outlook down to the recovering housing market – but plays down fears of a new property bubble driven by state-backed schemes such as Funding for Lending and Help to Buy. The recovery will bring unemployment down from its current level of 7.7 per cent to 7 per cent, or 2.28million, in early 2015, according to the report. David Cameron will today pledge new action to crack down on late payments which can drive small businesses to the brink of financial ruin. Some 85 per cent of small and medium-sized firms say they have had to grapple with late payment from contractors. The Prime Minister said: ‘I am determined to make Britain the best place to start, grow and do business and to back people who want to work and hard and get on.’","New Ernst & Young Item Club report hailed a 'firmly entrenched' recovery .

In the money: Jim Taylor's salary will increase from £130,000 to £170,000 . A Labour council has sparked fury by handing its chief executive a £40,000 pay rise while driving through deep cuts to services. Rochdale Council, which is currently making £45million worth of cuts, has announced that Jim Taylor’s salary will jump from £130,000 to £170,000 after an external review found he was ‘underpaid’. Other executives in line for a bumper pay rise include environment director Mark Widdup, whose salary will go up from £71,000 to a maximum of £109,000, and Mr Taylor’s deputy Linda Fisher, who will see her pay rise to £97,000. However, ordinary council workers have had their pay rises capped at just 1 per cent and 150 council workers will lose their jobs as part of £45million spending cuts, despite council tax going up by 3.5 per cent. The council’s Labour leader Colin Lambert defended the awards, saying it was ‘not good enough that previous management and leadership has allowed this council to linger at the bottom of the league’. But the decision has provoked anger in the town, which suffers from some of the most acute poverty in the country. Rochdale’s Labour MP Simon Danczuk said Mr Taylor’s 30 per cent pay rise was indefensible. ‘I . cannot support the council on this,’ he said. ‘This is a huge pay . increase and it is unacceptable. Rochdale has suffered from a big fall . in real wages in recent years and my weekly surgery is full of people . struggling to make ends meet.

He said: ‘If this is implemented, it will . do nothing to bridge the growing pay gap between the public and private . sector. 'Pay for council staff has been held down to a one per cent . increase and we need to think about what is fair and acceptable, bearing . in mind that the Prime Minister’s salary is only just over £140,000.’ 'Unacceptable: Rochdale's Labour MP, Simon Danczuk, said he could not support the rise .

Despite having expensive, specialised forensics equipment and highly trained scientists and police, developed countries still struggle to solve some murders. In Afghanistan, the job is even harder. Corruption is rife, the war masks a lot of the violence – and there’s only one forensics unit in the country. It’s called the Criminal Techniques Department (CTD) and writer Roc Morin, under military escort, paid a visit to its headquarters in Kabul and met the dedicated staff helping to bring law and order to a turbulent society. Dedicated: The CTD's staff tackle around 300 new cases a month . Firearms taken for ballistics testing are stashed in racks, ranging from vintage rifles to assault weapons . Corruption: The unit's director, Col Ayaz, admits that some people escape justice because of who they know . One case the team there tell him about involved a headless body that had been left in the middle of a road. A note pinned to the chest read: ‘Anyone who attends this man’s funeral can expect the same fate.’ In the end, plenty of people turned up to it, because the CTD’s document-exploitation expert, Noorullah Sangarkhil, with the help of a $98,000 machine that analyses handwriting, matched the writing on the note to a suspect that had been arrested. According to the director of forensics, Colonel Ayaz, another case is being hindered by corruption. He told Morin: ‘I can show you one case. A female was killed by a government official. He denied it, of course, but through the fingerprint on the gun, we found that this person killed the female. We sent that information back to the court.’ However, the suspect is still free. Col Ayaz added: ‘He has power, so he is still playing around the country, still free. In this country, some of the criminals go to jail and some go free because of the people they know.’ Col Ayaz admitted, though, that they are helped by the fact that only about 20 per cent of the country realises that fingerprints can help establish guilt. And the director himself didn’t even know what DNA was until four years ago. The CTD was established in 2003 by NATO and its 102 technicians tackle 300 new cases a month. They desperately need more equipment. One technician told Morin that they need about 10 bullet-matching machines, but only have one that was a present from Germany – and it was 30 years old when it arrived. Tech: The CTD's equipment, although old, has still helped to solve some murders . Most Afghans don't know that fingerprints can identify them . Identifying counterfeit currency, such as this fake $100 bill, is also part of the unit's role . There have been several incidents of Afghans turning on Nato troops in recent years, but Morin explained that the technicians at CTD are highly trusted, as evidenced by the fact that his Nato bodyguards took off all their armour once inside the building. US Senior Advisor David Jacobson told him: ‘These are good guys who care about what they do. I mean, they actually show up for work every day, which in this country isn’t always the case.’ This extract first appeared at Vice.

Targeted: Paula Reed, who had been fashion director at Harvey Nichols for a year . The fashion director of Harvey Nichols has resigned after animal rights activists accused her of breaking the exclusive department store’s no-fur policy. Paula Reed, who had been in the job for a year, was targeted in a campaign by the radical group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. Under her direction, clothes trimmed with fox, rabbit and raccoon fur made their way on to the shop floor despite the company’s decade-long ban. Peta complained to the store’s chief executive, Joseph Wan, and staged a protest outside its Leeds branch on Friday, when Miss Reed finally resigned. In the days before she quit, animal rights protesters had sent more than 5,000 emails and thousands of messages on social networks urging her to stop selling fur. Her departure was announced two days after Mr Wan was understood to have met Peta representatives furious about the fur-trimmed clothing. Miss Reed, who is married to architect Alfred Munkenbeck, told her 11,000 Twitter followers: ‘Funny how things turn out.’ Last night she declined to comment when approached at her £4million Victorian terraced house in west London. Peta claimed: ‘After receiving confirmation in a meeting with Joseph Wan that Reed was single-handedly responsible for breaking Harvey Nichols’ strict, decade-long policy against selling fur, Peta hopes her resignation will pave the way for the reinstatement of the department store’s previous, well-respected policy. ‘We ask Harvey Nichols to realign itself now with the ethical values of the British public – 95 per cent of whom would never wear real fur and who rightly regard the industry as one of the most violent, bloody and barbaric on the planet – and reinstate its ban on fur.’ Peta said it did not know the official reason for Miss Reed’s departure, but added she had resigned after its meeting with Mr Wan. Heartless Harvey: Peta protestors sent more than 5,000 e-mails and thousands of messages on social networks in their bid to stop Miss Reed selling fur products . Mr Wan said: ‘I am saddened about Paula’s departure and I wish her well in the future.’ After resigning, Miss Reed said: ‘I have thoroughly enjoyed working with the team at Harvey Nichols and now look forward to new and exciting opportunities.’ Harvey Nichols could not be reached for comment yesterday. In 2004, the store stopped selling fur after protests, but started doing so again last month. Miss Reed previously worked as style director at Grazia magazine and has held senior editorial roles at The Sunday Times, Harper’s Bazaar and InStyle. She began her career as a fashion PR for Lynne Franks, the publicist said to be the inspiration for Edina in the TV show Absolutely Fabulous.","Paula Reed allowed clothes trimmed with fox, rabbit and raccoon fur to be sold in the store .

David Cameron will today pledge new action to crack down on late payments which can drive small businesses to the brink of financial ruin. The move comes as legislation starts its progress through Parliament to cut National Insurance contributions for business by £2,000 a year. Some 85 per cent of small and medium-sized enterprises say they have had to grapple with late payment from contractors, often pushing them into severe cash-flow problems. Crackdown: David Cameron wants to make Britain the best place to do business, including getting paid on time . In the worst cases, it is not possible for small firms to pay their staff on time. The Prime Minister will announce a consultation on tackling late payment and whether there is a case for further legislation or penalties. He said: ‘It’s not right that suppliers are not getting paid on time for the work they do and the services they provide, and I know that late payment can have devastating effects on our small and medium-sized businesses. ‘I am determined to make Britain the best place to start, grow and do business and to back people who want to work and hard and get on. ‘The Government has already taken steps to help address this issue but I am clear that more needs to be done to build a business culture across all sectors of the economy that sees the fair, prompt and reliable payment of suppliers become a core corporate responsibility which is taken seriously at the most senior levels.’ The £2,000 tax cut, announced in the Budget, is intended to encourage small companies to take on extra staff. Mr Cameron is marking the . introduction of the National Insurance Contributions Bill with a tour of . small businesses in the east of England, insisting the Government is . keen to do everything it can help to help firms succeed. The tax cut is due to be in place by . April next year and the Government said 90 per cent of the benefit would . be felt by firms with fewer than 50 employees. The Prime Minister said the Employment Allowance would save 1.25 million businesses £2,000 per year - and mean 450,000 of them will have their national insurance bills eliminated entirely. He said: 'An ambitious and thriving small business sector is vital for steering the economic recovery in the right direction and helping us to succeed in the global race. 'We are determined to do everything we can to ensure that our small firms can be successful and prosperous and people can fulfil their aspirations. 'Last week, we helped people get on the housing ladder and own shares. This week, we're helping small businesses start and expand. This Government is 100 per cent% backing people who work hard and want to get on in life and we're going to finish the job we started.' John Allan, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: ‘Late payment is an increasing issue for our members. Being paid late or given extended terms can severely hamper many small firms. ‘They simply don’t have the same cash-flow buffer as a large business, so being paid on time can be the difference between being able to pay staff and not.’ Katja Hall, chief policy director of the CBI, said: ‘Late payment is a serious issue for all businesses but particularly for smaller firms, as cash flow is their life blood.’","Small businesses can run into severe problems as a result .

While others in the competition have two left feet, it would seem one Strictly contestant is a cut above the rest. But as actress Natalie Gumede emerged as the favourite to win this weekend, outraged viewers declared themselves unimpressed to learn that she had had a professional dance background. Many of them took to social networking site Twitter to complain that her previous training had given her an ‘unfair advantage’. The 29-year-old Coronation Street star received a wave of criticism from viewers with some even saying her points were ‘void’ because she was not a beginner. Shortly after signing for the BBC 1 show it emerged Miss Gumede was listed as ‘highly skilled’ dancer on her agency CV and worked professionally until she suffered an injury aged 19. The actress was previously credited for her abilities in cabaret, contralto, jazz dancing, Latin American and tap dancing, having started training at the tender age of four. But despite being upfront about her dance background many viewers branded Miss Gumede ‘miles in front’ of the other remaining contestants. On Twitter one viewer, calling themselves Pebbles, posted: ‘Why is everyone saying how good Natalie is? She used to dance professionally until she 19. Unfair advantage.’ And Andy Lloyd tweeted: ‘Natalie Gumede winds me up on Strictly, she’s a trained dancer and shouldn’t be doing it… She’s miles in front. Unfair.’ Touching on Miss Gumede’s theatre background, one fan, calling themselves Sybil Disobedience said: ‘I’m trying to be a better person. I will *not* take against Natalie because she’s a stage school grad with a clear advantage.’ On Saturday evening it was ‘love week’ on Strictly Come Dancing and the second live show of the series since the launch on September 14. Miss Gumede and her professional dance partner Artem Chigvintsev, 31, performed an impressive rumba which resulted in the couple topping the leader board with a score of 36 out of a possible 40 points. Wearing a sparkly blue dress, Miss Gumede enthralled judges Darcey Bussell, Bruno Tonioli, Craig Revel Horwood and Lenn Goodman with her sensual routine to Rihanna’s ‘Love the way you lie.’ Out: Vanessa Feltz and her partner James Jordan became the second couple to leave the show last night . Trained: It emerged shortly after she signed up to the show that Miss Gumede started dancing aged four . Miss Gumede, who played Kirsty Soames in Coronation Street, graduated from Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts in 2003. Her dance teacher said she was 'always top of the class' However audiences branded the couple’s high score of all ‘nines’ from the four judges as an obvious reflection of her stage school background. Adele Poultney posted online: ‘Can’t stand Natalie she is obviously a highly trained dancer!’ Another frustrated Strictly fan Dave Jones added: ‘Natalie is like one of those annoying girls from school who bangs on about how difficult they find things, but still get straight As.’ Miss Gumede, who played Kirsty Soames in ITV soap Coronation Street, graduated from Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts in 2003. Prior to her London training she trained from the age of four with dance teacher Susan Chippendale, who is now retired, in her home town in Lancashire. Speaking about her training yesterday, dance teacher Susan Chippendale, 66, told how she was always ‘top of the class’ and won competitions performing in dance festivals as a child. She said: ‘Her mum started taking her to my dance classes when she was only four, she just wanted to dance. ‘She was one of my best tap dancers – it’s all about rhythm and alertness. Outrage: Viewers berated the 'favourite to win' on Twitter for her experience in five styles of dance . Success: The pair received straight nines from the judges on Saturday night, topping the leaderboard . ‘She got very high marks in her final tap exams, and she used to do a lot of solo dances at festivals around the country when she was 11 or 12. ‘She stayed with me until she went to the Italia Conti school, obviously if you’ve danced before, your brain is used to telling your feet what to do. ‘However usually in this competition they’re not all total novices so I don’t think it’s fair to have a go at Natalie. ‘I hope she goes a long way in this year’s show – I just hope the public keep voting the right way!’ Mrs Chippendale retired from teaching dance six years ago and her dance school has closed down. Stragglers: Miss Gumede is far from the bottom two like fellow celebrities Julien Macdonald and Vanessa Feltz . Despite the controversy Strictly Come Dancing is still proving popular with TV viewers. Saturday night’s live show drew an audience of 9.8 million. At its peak the BBC dance competition received 10.9 million viewers beating ITV’s first live X Factor show which at peak only received an audience of 9.2 million. Strictly Come Dancing, hosted by Sir Bruce Forsyth and Tess Daly, is currently in its eleventh series and features celebrities with professional dance partners competing in Ballroom and Latin dances. Last night Radio 2 DJ Vanessa Feltz and professional partner James Jordan became the second couple to be voted off the show. The pair were in the dance off with fashion designer Julien Macdonald and his American partner Janette Manrara.","Coronation Street actress started dance classes when she was four .

Daredevil: Bernek was practicing a difficult method where divers fly very close to the ground for a long period of time at high speed . Expert: The skydiver, left, had around 1,800 dives under his belt and routinely filmed people's jumps . According to Randy Allison, the manager of Midwest Freefall Sport Parachute Club in Ray Township, where the fatal dive occurred, Bernek was diving too low. ‘The dive that he executed was a little too low and as a result he impacted the ground prematurely,’ Allison told the New York Daily News. The woman was standing just outside the landing zone when she was hit and was taken to hospital for non-life threatening injuries. The plane took off at 6:10 p.m. and the rest of the load went up 14,000 feet above ground for standard jumps but Bernek hopped out earlier — at 5,000 feet — to work on the dangerous technique. Dangerous: Bernek hopped out of the plane at 5,000 feet, which is much closer to the ground than normal jumps at 14,000 feet above ground . Many years' experience: He had been jumping for 15 years when the tragic accident happened on Saturday . Bernek, who started jumping at Midwest Freefall in 2002, had about 1,800 dives under his belt over the past 15 years. He already had his own equipment at this point so he just paid for the plane ride to altitude. He became a videographer for the club and recorded others' dives with helmet-mounted cameras. He also started teaching tandem and solo flights. ‘He was a mentor to a lot of people here and a guy who always had a smile on his face… this saddened us greatly,’ said Allison. Midwest Freefall has had no other serious injuries in its history, Allison said. The club adheres to the licensing system defined by the United States Parachute Association, which outlines what manoeuvres an individual is allowed to perform. Happy in the sky: Bernek had started teaching tandem and solo flights . 'Very accomplished': The club's manager says Bernek was well-respected in the community . Bernek met all the requirements for an expert D license. ‘He was very accomplished and well-respected in the community and very well-credentialed,’ said Allison. A friend's comment on Bernek's Facebook profile picture on August 11, which shows him doing the low-flying stunt, says: 'U look a little low...' Bernek's answer was: 'That explains the hands on the brake toggles... ha'.","Kenneth Ryan Bernek, 34, was trying to .

The term 'bionic man' was the stuff of science fiction in the 1970s, when a popular TV show called 'The Six Million Dollar Man' chronicled the adventures of Steve Austin, a former astronaut whose body was rebuilt using artificial parts after he nearly died. Now, a team of engineers has assembled a robot using artificial organs, limbs and other body parts that comes tantalizingly close to a true 'bionic man.' For real, this time. Scroll down for video . The 'Bionic Man': Bertolt Meyer, a social psychologist for the University of Zurich, poses for a photo Wednesday with the real deal . The artificial 'man' is the subject of a Smithsonian Channel documentary that airs Sunday, Oct. 20 at 9 p.m. Called ""The Incredible Bionic Man,"" it chronicles engineers' attempt to assemble a functioning body using artificial parts that range from a working kidney and circulation system to cochlear and retina implants. The parts hail from 17 manufacturers around the world. This is the first time they've been assembled together, says Richard Walker, managing director of Shadow Robot Co. and the lead roboticist on the project. '(It's) an attempt to showcase just how far medical science has gotten,' he says. The robot making appearances in the U.S. for the first time this week. Having crossed the Atlantic tucked inside two metal trunks — and after a brief holdup in customs — the bionic man will strut his stuff at the New York Comic Con festival on Friday. A working heart: Through its clear arteries, the bionic man can be seen pumping blood . Walker says the robot has about 60 to 70 percent of the function of a human. It stands six-and-a-half feet tall and can step, sit and stand with the help of a Rex walking machine that's used by people who've lost the ability to walk due to a spinal injury. It also has a functioning heart that, using an electronic pump, beats and circulates artificial blood, which carries oxygen just like human blood. An artificial, implantable kidney, meanwhile, replaces the function of a modern-day dialysis unit. Although the parts used in the robot work, many of them are a long way from being used in humans. The kidney, for example, is only a prototype. And there are some key parts missing: there's no digestive system, liver, or skin. And, of course, no brain. Watch it flow: Blood being pumped through arteries seen up close . The bionic man was modeled after Bertolt Meyer, a 36-year-old social psychologist at the University of Zurich who was born without his lower left arm and wears a bionic prosthesis. The man's face was created based on a 3D scan of Meyer's face. 'We wanted to showcase that the technology can provide aesthetic prostheses for people who have lost parts of their faces, for example, their nose, due to an accident or due to, for example, cancer,' Meyer says. Meyer says he initially felt a sense of unease when he saw the robot for the first time. The original: The first bionic man, as seen in the 1970s television show 'The Six Million Dollar Man' 'I thought it was rather revolting to be honest,' he says. 'It was quite a shock to see a face that closely resembles what I see in the mirror every morning on this kind of dystopian looking machine.' He has since warmed up to it, especially after the ""man"" was outfitted with some clothes from the U.K. department store Harrods. And the cost? As it turns out, this bionic man comes cheaper than his $6-million-dollar sci-fi cousin. While the parts used in the experiment were donated, their value is about $1 million.","The 'bionic man' phrase was coined from popular 1970's television show 'The Six Million Dollar Man'

Law enforcement officials in Maine have said they will review a complaint filed by PETA about a local lobster and crab processing plant after the organization took a secret video of plant workers. The footage was made by a PETA member who obtained full-time employment at the plant and wore a hidden camera to film its processes. Plant owner Linda Bean, of iconic retailer L.L. Bean fame, says her company Linda Bean's Maine Lobster meets or exceeds all industry and government regulations or standards. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Decapitated: A worker impales a lobster on a spike by its head and pull the body off while the creature is alive . Seeing orange: Maine Lobster owner Linda Bean says PETA's claims against her are unfounded . Denial: Linda Bean says her factory's practice of ripping the claws and head off live lobsters and grinding live crabs' organs off isn't cruel . District Attorney Geoffrey Rushlau says that in Maine, animal cruelty covers all sentient beings. The Merriam-Webster online dictionary defines sentient as 'responsive to or conscious of sense impressions.' Linda Bean's attorney Stephen Hayes told the Bangor Daily News that he does not consider lobsters to be sentient beings. PETA held a news conference on Tuesday to unveil the video of what they claim is cruel and inhumane treatment of lobsters and crabs in Portland. Clean break: The Linda Bean Maine Lobster worker pulls the body apart from the head as the lobster desperately moves its legs . Standard practice: The lobster's valuable claws are torn off before its head is removed . The video shows a Linda Bean's Maine Lobster worker showing the PETA operative the ropes. First up, he shows how to prepare live lobsters by ripping their claws off then tearing off the head. 'They're a little feisty. They're very alive. Uh, so you just rip off their claw, like I said,' he says, pulling off the live lobster's claws. 'And just shove it in straight,' he demonstrates, removing the creature's head by impaling it on a blade and tearing off the body. 'Rip off their skull.' 'Even a lobster, after you rip their claws and their tails off... they'll crawl across the floor and everything,' he says. 'And they don't die right away. I mean, they'll live for hours.' The bodies are thrown in a heap. At one point, one man jumps up and down on the bin of still-moving lobsters. Animal advocate: Dan Paden of PETA told reporters about the organization's discoveries on Tuesday in Portland (shown here at a previous PETA event) Sentient: Whether or not a lobster is conscious and can feel pain is a question before the District Attorney . Next, a worker demonstrates how to process live crabs. The live crabs' shells are struck or torn off. Their exposed organs are then pushed against spinning blade to remove them. 'Right where the mouth is, they come down on that spike,' says the worker, repeatedly smashing the live crab against the spike, pulling off the crab's shell then holding it against a spinning wheel as its legs still move. 'Get both sides and, like, find the guts inside,' he says, spinning off the creature's innards. 'See how they're still walking around?' he says, throwing the crab on a conveyerbelt. 'They're alive after you rip their things off?' asks the PETA operative. 'Yep,' comes the reply, adding that the crabs remain alive 'until they hit the boiling water,' and laughing. Mutilated: Live crabs are bashed on a spike to remove their shell, then their organs are ground off on a spinning wheel . The mutilated crabs are then boiled alive. Bean's attorney says that PETA's demands for more humane ways of killing lobsters is hypocritical, since the organization's aim is to stop all animals being used for food. The Maine Department of Marine Resources and the Maine Lobstermen’s Association also have criticized PETA’s attack on Bean’s processing plant. Rushlau told the Bangor Daily News that he will review the case further before deciding whether or not to take action.","An undercover PETA operative made a video of processes at Linda Bean's Maine lobster plant .

A teacher who was fired after her estranged husband began a period of threatening behavior to the school and children where she worked, has had some legislation brought about in her honor. Carie Charlesworth was fired in April from her position at Holy Trinity School in El Cajon near San Diego. She had taught at schools within the Roman Catholic Diocese of San Diego for 14 years, however she lost her job because of her ex-husbands' menacing, abusive behavior. California Governor Jerry Brown has now signed legislation that would protect victims of domestic violence from losing their jobs or being discriminated at work. New law: Former teacher Carie Charlesworth speaks during a press conference with her lawyer Kenneth Hoyt about legislation that will protect an employees job when faced with threats from abusive spouses . Brave: Carie Charlesworth thought her career as a teacher was over when she took her story--of being fired for being the victim of constant domestic violence--to local television . 'It’s incredibly gratifying to know that thousands of domestic violence victims won’t have to experience what I did — the devastation and financial insecurity of losing a job and their professional identity just because they are victims of domestic violence,' Carie Charlesworth said in a statement. Church officials have declined to comment, but earlier had sent a notice to parents, parishioners and others. The second-grade teacher was fired over campus safety concerns after her estranged husband was spotted on campus. In January of this year Ms. Charlesworth was forced to call police after what she called ‘a very bad weekend with him.’ The next day, she spoke to her principal to warn them about her ex-husband, Martin Charlesworth. Not long afterwards he showed up at the school parking lot - forcing the entire school to go into lockdown for 30 minutes. He was arrested. She was immediately put on leave, and her four children were barred from returning to the school. 'I was treated like the criminal,' Charlesworth said later. When she was terminated, 'My world fell apart. I felt victimized all over again.' Three months later Charlesworth received the letter informing her that she was fired – a move which despite 14 years working in the Diocese means she is now barred from working in any other schools in the area. The letter from the Diocese explained that Charlesworth was being fired because of her husband’s ‘twenty-plus year history of violence, abuse, and harassment of people - mostly women.’ ‘We know from the most recent incident involving you and Mrs. Wright (the principal) while you were still physically at Holy Trinity School, that the temporary restraining order in effect were not a deterrent to him,’ stated the letter.‘Although we understand he is current incarcerated, we have no way of knowing how long or short a time he will actually serve and we understand from court files that he may be released as early as next fall. In a letter from the Diocese who runs Holy Trinity School, Charlesworth was informed that she and her four kids were barred because her ex-husband was 'too dangerous' The school, meanwhile, maintains it took the correct course of action. 'If Mrs. Charlesworth were to continue at the school, the possibility of harm and violence to her and others was much greater than if she did not,' Tom Beecher, director of the diocese’s Office for Schools, said in the undated letter. 'We couldn’t possibly jeopardize innocent children to justify her return. Ms. Charlesworth had obtained a temporary restraining order against her husband and was extrememly concerned that he might come after her following years of verbal and emotional abuse. The new legislation covers the victims of stalking and sexual assault and requires employers to take reasonable steps to protect the workers, such as changing the workplace phone number, relocating the desk and implementing a safety plan. Ms. Charlesworth said after she was fired that keeping silent would have put co-workers and children attending the school at even greater risk because no one would have known of the danger. 'As a parent, I get their concerns. I do have four children. Every time we step out the door, there is that fear of the unknown. In today’s world, it is more dangerous to have an unknown threat than it is to have a known threat,' she said. In early September Charlesworth filed a lawsuit against the diocese, contending the church violated canon law by firing her. The diocese issued a statement defending its actions: 'We are confident that when the court is able to review the decision, the protection and safety of children will be understood as the only path the school could have taken.' Ms. Charlesworth is now studying to be a nurse and her four children attend public school.

At least 10 children are believed to have drowned when a boat carrying around 250 migrants capsized off the Italian island of Lampedusa yesterday, following a shipwreck last week which left more than 300 dead. Authorities said 221 people were rescued in a joint Italian-Maltese operation following the incident about 60 miles (100 km) south of the island. However the Italian news agency ANSA reported that around 50 dead bodies have been sighted, 10 of which were children. Survivors: Migrants climb aboard a life raft deployed by a military aircraft after a boat heading towards the Italian island of Lampedusa capsized leaving dozens dead . The capsizing of the boat occurred in waters where Malta has search and rescue responsibilities. The coastguard received a . satellite phone call from the boat and was able to locate it based on . the satellite coordinates. A Maltese armed forces aircraft spotted the wreckage initially and asked for Italy's help.The boat was spotted in difficulty by a Maltese military plane at around 1400 GMT, which dropped a liferaft. Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat told a news conference in Valletta there were indications at least 27 people had died 'and the number is expected to rise, possibly drastically'. He said 150 survivors were rescued aboard a Maltese ship. An Italian patrol boat had another 56 survivors, while a fishing boat had 15, said Cmdr. Marco Maccaroni of the Italian navy. 'This is not just another wake-up . call for Europe. This is the time for action,' Muscat said, adding he . had spoken to Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta to discuss the latest . disaster. 'This is a European problem, not a problem for Italy or Malta only.' The Italian news agency reported that around 50 dead bodies had been sighted, 10 of which were children . Survivors: Authorities said 221 people were rescued in a joint Italian-Maltese operation following the incident about 60 miles (100 km) south of Lampedusa . In a separate incident 12 migrants were killed when a boat sank off the Egyptian coast yesterday leaving 116 survivors. The Egyptian navy responded to a . distress call near the city of Alexandria, the official news agency . said, adding that 72 Palestinians, 40 Syrians, and four Egyptians . survived the shipwreck. Italy is asking for more European Union support and an overhaul of the bloc's immigration rules after last week's shipwreck. Last . week, a ship carrying some 500 Eritrean and Somali migrants capsized . off Lampedusa, killing more than 300 people. Only 155 survived. The . deaths have prompted calls for the European Union to do more to better . patrol the southern Mediterranean and prevent such tragedies. Last . week's disaster was one of the worst in a long migrant crisis that has . seen tens of thousands of people arriving in small, unsafe boats in . southern Italy. A boat carrying about 200 migrants has capsized today off the Italian island of Lampedusa where a shipwreck last week left more than 300 dead. Above, coastguard boats patrol the area (file photo) Earlier today, at least 500 more . migrants in at least three separate boats arrived or were rescued on the . way to different parts of Sicily. In . the first operation, a Maltese vessel rescued around 200 migrants on . two rubber dinghies who had put out an SOS call while still in Libyan . waters. Meanwhile, a . boat flying a Bahamas flag came to the aid of 118 migrants - and in a . third incident, a Navy vessel called on a tugboat to rescue 175 migrants . from another two boats. Lampedusa, a tiny island located midway between Sicily and Tunisia, has borne the brunt. According . to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, 32,000 have . arrived in southern Italy and Malta this year alone, around two thirds . of whom have filed requests for asylum. Soldiers carry the recovered bodies of victims of the Lampedusa tragedy . Although most migrants come from . sub-Saharan Africa, this year many are fleeing the Syrian civil war or . political turmoil in Egypt and other parts of North Africa. Many are drawn by hopes of finding work in Europe and often do not stay in Italy. 'Refugees from Syria have fled the depths of despair to seek safety in Egypt,' said Amnesty expert Sherif Elsayed-Ali. 'But . instead of providing shelter and hope for a new life, the Egyptian . authorities' actions are compelling many refugees from Syria into . life-threatening situations, including entrusting their lives to . smugglers in order to make the perilous journey across the Mediterranean . Sea."" Once welcomed with open arms, many of the Syrians who took . refuge in Egypt are now targeted by hate speech and intimidation. Survivors of last week's shipwreck look out to sea as the Italian Navy and coastguard carry on searching . Their . dramatic change in fortune is one of the unexpected consequences of the . Egyptian military's ouster of President Mohammed Morsi, whose . Islamist-dominated government had offered them favorable conditions. Lampedusa is also the destination of choice of smugglers ferrying migrants from Libya or Tunisia to Europe. They usually charge more than 1,000 euro (£850) a head and cram the migrants onto boats that routinely run into trouble and require rescue. During a visit to Lampedusa this week, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso promised Italy some 30million euro in EU funds to better care for newly arrived migrants, and Italian officials pledged to put the issue on the agenda of an upcoming European Union summit.","Boat carrying around 250 migrants capsized 60m south of the Italian island .

He was 62. Hijuelos died of a heart attack in Manhattan on Saturday while playing tennis, according to his agent, Jennifer Lyons. 'The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love' became a best seller and earned him international acclaim. He won the Pulitzer for fiction in 1990, making him the first Hispanic writer to receive that honor. Oscar Hijuelos: A Cuban-American novelist who won a Pulitzer Prize for his 1989 novel The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love and whose work often captured the loss and triumphs of the Cuban immigrant experience, has died . Prize-winning: Musician brothers Cesar and Nestor leave Cuba for America in the 1950s, hoping to hit the top of the Latin music scene . The novel tells the story of two Cuban brothers who journey from Havana to New York to start an orchestra. At one point in the story, the brothers appear on the television sitcom 'I Love Lucy,' which starred Lucille Ball and her Cuban bandleader husband, Desi Arnaz. The book was eventually turned into a movie starring Armand Assante and Antonio Banderas. In his 2011 memoir, 'Thoughts Without Cigarettes,' Hijuelos writes of how he struggled against being labeled an 'ethnic' writer and notes that even today there are few other Latinos whose work, despite the considerable number of talented authors, has been awarded the same recognition. After a trip with his mother to Cuba as a young child, he became ill with a kidney disease and was hospitalized for a year, during which he loses his Spanish-speaking ability, and never truly recovers it. Groundbreaking: Oscar Jerome Hijuelos died whilst playing tennis in Manhattan this weekend. He won the Pulitzer for fiction in 1990, making him the first Hispanic writer to receive that honor . 'For the longest time, all I would know was that I had gotten sick in Cuba, from Cuban microbios, that the illness had blossomed in the land of my forebears, the country where I had once been loved and whose language fell as music on my ears,' Hijuelos writes. 'Of course, diseases happen anywhere, and children get sick under any circumstances, but what I would hear for years afterward from my mother was that something Cuban had nearly killed me and, in the process of my healing, would turn my own `Cubaness' into air.' It was an experience of displacement and a never-ending inability to reach an identity he inherits that many Cubans of his generation can understand. Thoughts: In his 2011 memoir, 'Thoughts Without Cigarettes,' Mr. Hijuelos writes of how he struggled against being labeled an ¿ethnic¿ writer and notes that even today there are few other Latinos whose work has been awarded the same recognition . It also defined much of his development as a writer, as he initially hesitated to embrace his story and that of his family as a source of inspiration for his fictional characters - too ashamed to put them on paper, believing the world was indifferent to his tale. Hijuelos was born and raised in New York City and enrolled in local community colleges where an array of early writing teachers - Susan Sontag, Donald Barthelme, and Frederic Tuten - encouraged him to continue to pursue his craft. He was also exposed to Cuban and Latin American writers including Jose Lezama Lima, Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Carlos Fuentes, whose work inspired him. His other novels include 'Our House in the Last World,' 'Empress of the Splendid Season,' 'Dark Dude,' 'The Fourteen Sisters of Emilio Montez O'Brien' and 'A Simple Habana Melody.'

"By . Brian Viner . PUBLISHED: . 17:03 EST, 13 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:35 EST, 14 October 2013 . Long ago, when I was a schoolboy, an older cousin showed me round his office and introduced me to a strange piece of apparatus that he said could photograph a document and send an instant reproduction anywhere in the world, as long as there was a similar machine to receive it. I was agog, especially when he demonstrated it, for the accompanying beeps and whirrs made its remarkable capabilities seem even more like wizardry. But yesterday I had a contraption delivered that makes the dear old fax machine look like something from the Middle Ages. Price of progress: Brian Viner poses with the expensive fruit of his labour . It was a 3D printer, called a Cube, and its  U.S. manufacturers claim it can print anything from tools to teacups. Not images, you understand, but actual objects. Tools for the toolbox and teacups for the crockery cupboard. I imagined all kinds of things beamed before my eyes, as if from Star Trek’s teleporter. Could this be the most exciting invention ever? The company, Cubify, clearly thinks so, although it is understandably more reticent about the alarming, widely reported capacity of a 3D printer to produce fully functioning firearms. But I didn’t want to jump the gun. I didn’t want a gun at all. I wanted to start by printing something simple. Something inoffensive. If, that is, I could get the thing to work. I am not what you would call technologically adept. Hooking up a £49.99 Epson printer takes me to the very limit of my technical know-how, and I have often have to call downstairs to my wife, Jane, who is much better at following diagrams. Unlike me, she can assemble an Ikea wardrobe in less than a fortnight. But don’t get me wrong. I like gadgets, as long as someone else can make them work for me. I have an iPhone. I Tweet. More than once I’ve used the red button on my telly. In motion: The cube can build plastic objects, like this fledgling chess piece, layer by layer . And when I heard the Cube was being launched in the UK this month, following its successful introduction in the U.S. earlier in the year, I knew I wanted one. After all, it’s said that 3D printers could transform the way we live, enabling us to make, rather than buy, the things we need. The solid imaging process known as 3D printing — or stereolithography — was invented more than 25 years ago by a clever man called Chuck Hull, now in his mid-70s. But it has taken until now to refine his U.S. Patent, titled ‘Apparatus for Production of Three-Dimensional Objects by Stereolithography’, into a commercially viable product. My Cube cost £1,195, which isn’t chicken-feed, but it’s not much more than the price of a swanky laptop. Gradual: The chess piece, built from a pre-loaded template, rose slowly but surely from the glass plate . When I told my son Jake, 15, there was a Cube on the way, he was properly excited. And, as every parent of teenagers knows, you need a teenage boy onside whenever you’re trying to do anything that involves software. You’ll be pleased to hear that getting the Cube out of its box posed me no difficulties whatsoever. Then I opened its manual. By page four, I was stumped. I had to recruit both teenage sons to help me activate my Cube ‘by entering your Cube’s serial number in the designated bar under the Activate My Cube tab’ — the sort of instruction that transports me back to the Seventies’ physics lessons which had me frozen in fear. The Cube comes with ten pre-programmed designs, carried on a memory stick that slots into the back. Write caption here . From the options available, we chose to print a plastic fluorescent green teacup. Not that we needed one — who does? — but we thought it might be nice to have something from which we could toast our first successful 3D printing venture. There are 15 other colours of plastic to choose from. Cartridges cost £52.80 each, and contain enough plastic to make 53 mobile phone covers — should you wish to. Then came the grown-up bit: prepping the Cube for action. First, we had to load the cartridge. This is full of plastic resin, a fine filament of which is forced through a nozzle, heated up, then directed onto a glass plate below. Success: Brian printed out two of the luminous chess pieces . The process from there is effectively that of a high-tech potter’s wheel, with layers of heated plastic building up and then cooling, until the object is complete. We did everything by the book, and then pressed the start button. With what my Joe, 18, called ‘Steven Spielberg-y noises’, the Cube whirred into action. We rejoiced. Our teacup would be ready in three hours. But after 20 minutes of watching, engrossed, there came an unsettling ‘tkkk, tkkk, tkkk’ sound, and the horribly portentous words ‘Filament Flow Fail’ appeared on the little screen at the base. The operation had ‘aborted’. This happened three times, and while I’m quite used to technology malfunctioning, the children were befuddled. ‘How, how, is it a filament flow fail... how?’ lamented Joe. ‘Stop saying how!’ barked Jake. ‘Don’t get shirty,’ snapped Jane, getting shirty. After almost four hours, all that the Cube had produced was a family row. Well, that and a disc of green plastic, the aborted base  of a teacup. We needed external help, so I called customer service support. I was told someone would call back, and a little while later, someone did. Not from PC World in nearby Hereford — oh no! — but from Suite 400 in Perimeter Center North, on the outskirts of Atlanta, Georgia, no less. This was Michael, Senior Project Manager with 3D Systems Inc, which operates Cubify. Michael assured me there were already Cubes in every country in the world and he certainly didn’t think it odd to be ringing someone in north Herefordshire. Michael stayed on the phone for 83 minutes, resolving our difficulties in the sympathetic but authoritative manner of an air traffic controller explaining to a passenger, forced to take control after the collapse of the pilot, how to land a plane. Intricate: The pieces have precise battlements and even a spiral staircase inside . After a long consultation, he told us we probably had an issue with our Z-Gap. Being American, he pronounced Z as zee. ‘Our C-gap?’ I asked him. ‘No,’ he replied, in the kindly way of someone dealing with a small child, ‘your Z-Gap.’ This, it transpired, is the name for the space between the nozzle of the print jet and the glass plate, or print pad, on which a circle of glue must first be smeared so the molten plastic sticks.Ours, Michael reckoned, was probably too small, inhibiting the filament flow. ‘Ah, the filament flow,’ I exclaimed. Now that was something I knew about. It is funny, when dealing with technology, how words or phrases that were completely unknown to you a few hours earlier begin to take on the comforting familiarity of a relative’s name. Jane, the boys and I had already been bandying ‘filament flow’ around as we might talk about Grandma Anne or cousin Rachel, and now we started discussing our Z-Gap as though it, too, were part of the family. We widened the setting, and with Michael still on the phone so he could check that the Steven Spielberg-y noises were as they should be, we started the printing process again. This time, we decided to use another of the basic templates that the Cube offers: a chess piece. I have a handsome wooden chess set in conventional black and white that certainly doesn’t need two vibrant green rooks, or castles. Yet creating them was something that I urgently, profoundly wanted to do. Contrast: However, the new additions to Brian's chess set were not exactly inconspicuous . This time, mercifully, there was no failure of the filament flow. Our Z-Gap was perfect. The rook rose slowly and noisily, yet rather majestically from the plate, a small domestic triumph which felt like a giant leap for mankind. I’m suddenly struck by the horror that printing off a gun might not be that much more difficult an operation. A 25-year-old Texan called Cody Wilson, who describes himself as a crypto-anarchist, has developed a 3D printable ‘Wiki weapon’, called The Liberator. He posted instructions for making The Liberator online, and they were downloaded 100,000 times in two days, before the U.S. State Department had them removed. Worryingly, metal detectors cannot detect a plastic gun. To the alarm of security services all . round the world, Israeli TV reporters built the gun and tested it . successfully using 9mm cartridges, then smuggled it into the country’s . parliament building, just to see if they could. Pointless? Brian's sons were not entirely convinced by the usefulness of their father's latest purchase . A more sophisticated printer than the Cube is required to do this, but the principle is just the same as my innocent chess pieces: layers of molten plastic building each of the components of a gun. I got back to the job in hand and watched my rookie rook growing. It took almost two hours to complete, but was a delightful little thing, with precise battlements and even a tiny spiral staircase inside. Then we printed another. It has to be said they stand out on my chessboard like alien invaders. But one day we’ll get round to printing the other pieces to keep them company. In the meantime, we’re determined to print a whole teacup. But to get more sophisticated with our designs, we need to download Cube software, which is the only way we’ll hold the interest of Joe, in whom the second rook seemed to awaken a certain cynicism. ‘It’s good,’ he said, ‘but what’s the point of just creating these things for the sake of it? It’s like a high-tech Play-Doh press.’ I had 1,195 good reasons to disagree with him, but I could see his point.","The Cube is now available for £1,195 and can 'print' small objects .

The six workers and one volunteer were travelling in a four-vehicle convoy in the north of the country when the attackers blocked their path and opened fire, according to Syria state media. They had been delivering medical supplies in the Idlib province when the abduction took place near the town of Saraqeb, at around 11.30am local time. Danger: The kidnapped people were members of the Red Cross who were working in Syria (file picture) Help: The people, who have not been identified, has been delivering medical supplies in the Idlib province in northern Syria . Treatment: A spokesman has called for the immediate release of the workers, saying they are urgently needed to help the people of Syria . The Syrian media reports blamed the attack on 'terrorists' - a term often used to describe the rebels fighting President Bashar Assad. The Idlib area has been largely under rebel control for the past year. A spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross today confirmed that the people had been kidnapped, but that they had not been contacted by anybody claiming responsibility. The organisation has called for their immediate release. Ewan Watson said: 'I am able to confirm that six ICRC staff . members and one Syrian Arab Red Crescent volunteer have been abducted . near Idlib in northwestern Syria. War-torn: The kidnapping took place in the dangerous Idlib province . 'We . are calling for their immediate and unconditional release of this team . which was delivering humanitarian assistance to those most in need - and . we do that on both sides of the front lines.' The Red Cross has not offered any information about the gender of nationality of the six employees who were captured. However, a spokesman said that the team had been in the field since 10 October to assess the medical situation in the area and to look at how to provide medical aid in the province, which is said to be: 'by definition is a difficult area to go in.' News of the kidnapping came as further . violence erupted in the Syrian capital, Damascus, where state media . also reported that its own headquarters in the city's Umayyad Square were damaged by two car bombs.

It has been a conflict of particular brutality, with the international Human Rights Watch organisation last week accusing rebel forces of killing 190 civilians and taking 200 hostages in a single attack earlier this year. People around the world were particularly horrified by reports of a chemical weapons attack in August which killed an estimated 1,400 people. Following international pressure, a team of inspectors from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons were sent into the country to oversee the destruction of the Syrian government's chemical weapon supply. Inspection: Footage allegedly showing the OPCW working in Syria was aired last week . Unknown: The broadcast, from Syrian TV, shows the inspectors at an unspecified location in Syria . The team, which was this week awarded the Nobel peace prize for their work, entered the country at the beginning of the month, and was reportedly filmed starting work on President Assad's stockpiled munitions.

Museums are too full of computer screens and are ‘patronising’ towards children, Mary Beard  said yesterday. The classicist and TV presenter said she wanted to ‘ban computers’ from museums which had lost some of their ‘mystique’ and ‘glamour’. Professor Beard, 58, said museums had ‘done a huge amount to get children in’. But she added: ‘A part of me thinks that some of it is a bit patronising. ‘Some of that old mystique... some of the glamour has gone a bit – too many bloody labels and buttons to push. I would ban any computers from any galleries.’ She said she had taken her children to the Natural History Museum, but all they wanted to do was ‘push the buttons’. And she bemoaned the replacement of traditional museum displays in glass cases with interactive exhibitions. She said: ‘We found this beautiful gallery of stuffed birds, and there was a notice saying “sorry, we realise this is totally unacceptable and the way the birds were killed wouldn’t have lived up to Health and Safety standards”.’ The note explained that the gallery was to be replaced ‘with some great interactive display’, she added. The University of Cambridge Classics professor has presented several BBC historical documentaries, mainly focusing on the Romans. Speaking at the Cheltenham Literature Festival, she revealed that her love of Classics was inspired by a visit to the British Museum when she was five. She could not see into the high glass cases, so a curator opened one and brought out a piece of carbonised Egyptian cake that was 2,500 years old. ‘I couldn’t believe it was so old. I just knew that this was something that was kind of outside anything I had ever begun to think about before,’ she said. She added that nowadays ‘they wouldn’t get the carbonised cake out’, but that children could do things like ‘have a sleepover among the mummies at the British Museum’. Changed: Places like the Natural History Museum used to be all about the artefacts, Mary Beard claims . Now it is all about technology, Mary Beard said. She reminisced about seeing Egyptian cake on her first trip . Professor Beard defended the teaching of Latin and Ancient Greek in schools, saying children should be allowed to study without having ‘really specific employment objectives’. She said: ‘It is about getting exercise with the brain, the more you exercise it and expand it into different areas the better a citizen you will be.’ She also said being an academic would always come before her TV work. ‘You can go down a treacherous path, that all you need to do is do telly and that’s enough – it’s not,’ she said. Asked what her colleagues thought of her TV work and attempts to popularise Classics, she joked that they ‘were very polite’. ‘It is quite a good idea to do [this sort of thing] when you are a bit older,’ she added. ‘I have done my time, I do my teaching. ‘I’m first a professional classicist. Everything else I do, I do in my  so-called spare time, and I think that is important.’","Professor Beard says the Natural History Museum has lost its 'mystique'

Tough: Five-time world wife carrying champion Taisto Miettinen carries Reetta Sairanen through a tough water obstacle during the event's final heat at Sunday River Ski Resort in Newry on Saturday . Powering over hurdles, ducking sand traps and pushing through a water hole alongside 50 other competitive couples, the dominant duo took home Sairanen's weight (89 pounds) in beer and five times her weight in cash ($445). Now they're set to compete in the World Wife Carrying Championship in Finland next year, according to Sun Journal. Miettinen has won the world championship five times, but with a different teammate. Asked the secret to wife carrying, Miettinen said, 'You must have power, you must be fast and you must have sustained strength...The woman’s weight, it is important.' South Paris' Jesse Wall and Christine Arsenault secured a place in the top three after setting the pace early in the race. Asked how they got into the sport, Wall said, 'I have a very little wife who said to me, ‘We’ve got to go try this, it will be a lot of fun.'

But 45 years on the Barcolana regatta now attracts 2,000 boats from all across the globe, transforming the coastline with a bevy of boats. The week-long celebration of sailing was capped off today with the Barcolana International Sailing Race, with hundreds of yachts taking part. The 45th annual Barcolana Regatta capped off a week of sailing celebrations in the Gulf of Trieste today as thousands of boats took part . The regatta began as a race between 51 locals but is now the biggest event of its kind in the Mediterranean and one of the busiest in the world . Classic yachts are in full display during the week-long event as well as smaller vessels designed for youngsters aged between 15 and 18 . Hundreds of thousands of people spent the week at Trieste's biggest annual event, enjoying classic boat races, land events and night-time sailing. The gathering is the biggest of its kind anywhere in the Mediterranean and turns the Gulf of Trieste into the unofficial sailing capital of Europe for seven days. The start line is traditionally . underneath the Victory Lighthouse, built in 1927 to light the Gulf and . serve as a monument to those killed in World War One. The Victory Lighthouse (pictured centre) was built in 1927 and serves as a monument to Italy's soldiers who died during the First World War . Aided by stronger winds this year than last the boats, captained by holiday sailors and world-class helmsmen alike, took off across the Gulf . The race heads around four buoys, one of which is traditionally dropped into the waters of Slovenia, covering about 16 nautical miles . Last year's race was a slow-motion . affair as low winds meant boats struggled to reach top speeds, though . the wind picked up this time around. In the classic yacht class over 30 vintage boats animated the Gulf, racing along on a strong south-easterly wind. Leone Sirio's ""Lucia""  and ""Marilu"", belonging to Vincenzo Ciumbo, received the Best Restoration trophy and the Spirit of Tradition trophy. A very light breeze accompanied the Barcolana by Night Jotun Cup. First to the finish line was Goofy being sailed by Marco and Pietro Perelli, but they were disqualified for an early start. The annual Barcolana regatta, near northern Italy, is one of the largest sailing races in the world and caps off a week of celebrations which include land events . Watched from land, sea and air the race attracted over 100,000 people this year alone and is getting bigger every time . The race passes Miramare castle, built in 1860 by Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian of Hapsburg as a residence for himself and his wife, Charlotte of Belgium . You have to be brave to risk damaging your boat in the crowded race that attracts thousands of boats to its week of events . That handed a first-time victory to Marco Perosa and his boat ReNero ahead of two of his historical rivals. Everyone from brave amateurs all the way up to world-class helmsmen can take part in the race which is always held on the second Sunday of October.

George Osborne announced plans to fast-track Chinese visa applications during a visit to the country . Visa applications by wealthy Chinese businessmen and tourists are to be fast-tracked as part of a charm offensive designed to attract billions of pounds of investment. The move was announced by Chancellor George Osborne, who is on a week-long tour of China aimed at drumming up trade. This week’s visit comes amid signs of a thaw in relations with Beijing, which have been in deep freeze since David Cameron met the Dalai Lama in London last year. Mr Osborne is in China at the same time as London Mayor Boris Johnson, who arrived in Beijing for a six-day trade visit yesterday. The visa decision comes despite reservations from Home Secretary Theresa May, who warned last year that relaxing rules could pose a threat to national security. The changes will reduce the need for Chinese visitors to the European Union to submit separate visa applications for Britain. Selected Chinese travel agents will be able to apply for UK visas by submitting just the visa form for entry to the EU’s Schengen area, of which Britain is not part. A new 24-hour 'super priority' visa . service will become available from next summer next year, while . officials are also looking at expanding a VIP mobile visa service, . currently operating in Beijing and Shanghai, to the whole country. The . service involves visa teams going out to applicants to collect their . completed forms and biometric data, with the whole process taking less . than five minutes. In 2012, 210,000 visas were issued to visiting Chinese nationals who went on to contribute around £300million to the economy. London Mayor Boris Johnson (pictured with Beijing Mayor Wang An Shun) is also in China for a trade meeting . The Government has a target of trebling the number of Chinese tourists coming to Britain by 2015. Mr Osborne, said: ‘These changes will streamline and simplify the process, while ensuring the system is strong and secure. This is good news for business and tourism.’ The move will be welcomed by . businesses in the UK who have complained that the existing regime is . discouraging high-spending Chinese visitors from coming to Britain. In a sign of the changing balance of power in Britain's relations with China, neither the Chancellor nor the London Mayor is expected to raise the country's abysmal human rights record. In an interview with Sky News yesterday Mr Johnson refused five times to discuss human rights in China, or the status of the Dalai Lama, spiritual leader of Tibet. Mr Osborne also announced details of an £800million Chinese investment in the revamp of Manchester Airport. Pictured, a graphic showing how the airport would look . Mr Johnson, normally no stranger to controversy, said: 'It's not my job as Mayor to insert myself into controversial areas of international dispute.' Aides to the Chancellor also confirmed he has no plans to raise the human rights issue - a stance which will anger campaigners on the issue.

As the government shutdown enters a third week, a group of veterans and tea party groups protested their anger by storming the World War II memorial in Washington, DC. The protest Sunday started at the World War II memorial before moving to the National Mall and eventually winding up outside the White House. 'Tear down these walls,' the crowd chanted. Protesters also sang 'God bless America' and other patriotic songs as they entered the memorial plaza. End of the line: The veterans march Sunday ended outside the White House where law enforcement officers clashed with the group . Fed up: Protesters with the ""Million Vet March on the Memorials"" rally at the National U.S. World War II Memorial . The memorial has become a political symbol in the bitter fight between Democrats and Republicans over who is at fault since the shutdown began. Earlier rallies have focused on allowing access for World War II veterans visiting from across the country with the Honor Flight Network. A protest by truckers converged with a rally by a group called the Million Vet March at the World War II Memorial. Participants cut the links between metal barriers at the National Park Service site and pushed them aside. Jeff Thompkins of New York told WRC-TV he was there because people fight and died for the freedom to visit public spaces and to protest. 'Our constitutional rights are being taken away,' Thompkins said. 'People made the ultimate sacrifice, and they should be open to the public, open to everyone to come down here and see this. This is ridiculous. This is not just and not fair. It’s just not fair.' Jim Weller of Allentown, Pennsylvania came to the protest to 'stand up for me rights'. Undeterrred: Protesters with the ""Million Vet March on the Memorials"" rally Sunday in front of the National U.S. World War II Memorial . Drastic measures: Protesters with the ""Million Vet March on the Memorials"" call for impeachment of U.S. President Barack Obama in front of the White House . 'My father was a World War II veteran, shot down in the Philippines in 1945, and for them to shut down this memorial is absurd,' Mr Weller said. Fellow-protester Cindy Good wanted this to be a message to lawmakers in Congress. 'They need to listen to the American People,' she said. 'And try to work together in Congress to get this whole thing worked out.' The rally then made its way towards the White House, according to NBC Washington. Furious: Protesters from the ""Million Vet March on the Memorials"" descend on the White House . Barricades on barricades: Protesters stack barricades believed to be from the World War II Monument outside the White House . Protesters carried barricades, likely from the monument, to the front gates of the White House, as shown on security footage. The demonstration was soon broken up by police, and most protesters boarded buses out of the area. Almost 60 per cent of Utahans responding to a Brigham Young University poll this past week said they want Sen. Lee to compromise, even if it means funding Obamacare. His approval rating has dropped from 71 per cent in June to only 57 per cent, the poll added. Protester Melissa Mather called the memorial's closure 'a slap in the face to all Americans' and she believes that President Obama and all the lawmakers should resign. 'I just want to take them all and shake them,' the Havre de Grade, Maryland-resident said. Don Armstrong, a veteran who served in Somalia, KOsovo, Iraq and Afghanistan drove to the rally from West Virginia. He attended the protest because he relies on veterans benefits and is afraid disability payments will soon stop. 'I'm not a Democrat or Republic or anything like that,' he said. 'I blame them all.' Last week, Veteran Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki told Congress that benefits would end on November 1 if the shutdown was still going on. Republican leaders attended the event Sunday and turned it into a platform to speak their position. Republican Utah Senator Mike Lee and Governor Sarah Palin attended the event. Mr Cruz said President Barack Obama is using veterans as pawns in the shutdown. Support fading: Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) speaks at the ""Million Vet March on the Memorials"" as support for his agenda falls even in his home state .

Lee led the charge to defund or delay funding to Obamacare that is widely credited with causing the shutdown. With only four days left until the federal government runs out of money, Washington has been brought to its knees. Running the risk of defaulting on massive debt, and unable to pay federal employees, Congress has an all-time low single-digit approval rating. 'This is the people's memorial,' Ms Palin said. 'Our veterans should be above politics.'","Demonstrators gathered at the World War II Monument, despite it being closed from the shutdown .

The investigation into the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal is to be widened amid claims he targeted patients at more hospitals than first thought. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt today revealed new evidence has come to light beyond the NHS institutions already being examined. It suggests the disgraced former BBC presenter’s abuse of children on NHS premises may have been more regular and more serious than those offences committed at the Corporation. Inquiry: The scale of abuse by former BBC presenter Jimmy Savile could go further than the 13 NHS institutions already under investigation . Savile was believed to have committed offences at 13 hospitals. Investigations were launched into activities at Broadmoor, Stoke Mandeville and Leeds General Infirmary following the abuse revelations last year, along with inquiries at 10 other trusts. But in an update to Parliament, Mr Hunt said more evidence has now emerged suggesting he abused patients at more hospitals. New information has come to light relating to the existing investigations across 13 institutions as well as ‘reference to other hospitals’, the Health Secretary said. Mr Hunt said any hospitals involved would be named once the review of the new potential evidence had been completed. ‘We understand the material includes information about hospitals where investigations are already under way and reference to other hospitals,’ he said in a statement to Parliament . ‘Once this review is complete, the information will be passed on to the relevant trusts or investigations as quickly as possible.’ Leeds General Hospital is one of three hospitals where inquiries are under way into Jimmy Savile's crimes . The final reports of the current investigations are now expected to be finished by next June. He added: ‘Although all 13 investigations are currently on track, this additional material means that the timetable will be affected. ‘It is vital that the final NHS investigation reports are thorough and complete and reflect all the evidence about Jimmy Savile's pattern of offending.’ In June Liz Dux,  one of the lawyers representing his victims, said Savile's offences on NHS property were just as bad as those committed on the BBC premises and in some cases much worse. Dux, of Slater & Gordon, added that more people in the NHS than previously thought knew about what was happening and took no action. She said one victim had been assaulted . while lying on a hospital trolley going to have an x-ray, and another . was passing in a wheelchair when she was attacked.

Whistles, the high-street brand beloved of the Duchess of Cambridge, Kim Sears and Samantha Cameron among others, is to launch its own range of menswear. A new design team has been hired to work under Whistles design director Nick Passmore on the new range which will make its first appearance in stores next autumn. Speaking of the decision to launch a new range of menswear, Whistles CEO Jane Shepherdson told Vogue's website: 'We have defined our aesthetic, and achieved a consistency in our design.' Famous fans: The Duchess of Cambridge and Samantha Cameron have both been photographed in Whistles . Royal fans in the making? The Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry can now join the Whistles fan club too . She continued: 'Menswear is something that we have been planning to do since we started in 2008. We recognise that, as with womenswear, there is considerable expansion in the contemporary middle market, this is an ideal time to capitalise on this opportunity and bring the Whistles aesthetic to menswear.’ The collection will be available online and in key Whistles stores, as well as some luxury department stores. Whistles started life in 1978 as an independent boutique and has since evolved into a leading womenswear brand, characterised by a contemporary, intelligent sense of style and design. The brand, which already has outlets in Paris, Berlin, Munich and Moscow, is currently in discussion with a large American department store about opening a concession next spring. And after making a well-received debut on the London Fashion Week catwalk last February, Whistles' expansion shows no sign of slowing down - helped along by a glamorous army of high profile fans. Royal approval: The Duchess of Cambridge at the Olympics in Whistles - the woman . behind is also in Whistles . Winning look: Kim Sears wore the brand to watch boyfriend Andy Murray take gold at the Olympics last year . The Duchess of Cambridge, Andy Murray's girlfriend Kim Sears, and Prime Minister David Cameron's wife Samantha Cameron are staunch supporters of the brand, although Shepherdson herself cites gamine director Sofia Coppola as her muse, and 'go-to woman for inspiration'. Nevertheless, the former Kate Middleton and her sister Pippa both have wardrobes full of Whistles clothes, and the Duchess is not afraid to show her thrifty side by recycling them. Last summer the Duchess wore the £150 blue Bella dress to both the Diamond Jubilee Concert and the Olympic Games Closing Ceremony. Despite the dress - and every other piece Kate wears - selling out moments after she was spotted in it, Shepherdson denies the so-called 'Kate Middleton effect' has boosted sales. Speaking in 2012, she said: 'It raises profile, it’s great, we get known in countries we're not known in. 'But it's not going to turn us into a success overnight because she wears it. Fortunately, she looks great in it and it's a great advert, but no more than that.'","High street favourite is to launch menswear for the first time next autumn .

China is warning the world to divest itself of American interests as the risk of a default rises with each passing day as the Thursday shutdown deadline draws ever closer. Through official government news agency Xinhua, the Chinese government Sunday denounced the current state of the U.S. government and it’s finances, advising it would be a good time to start considering a ‘de-Americanised’ world. ‘It is perhaps a good time for the befuddled world to start considering building a de-Americanised world,’ the Guardian first reported the Chinese news agency said. Fix it: International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde warns if the U.S. doesn't raise the debt ceiling that the world economy will be plunged into another deep recession . Officials in both the American government and abroad are also voicing concerns that the failure to come to an agreement on raising the debt ceiling before Thursday’s deadline would have a grave impact on the world’s economy. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has repeatedly voiced concern that the U.S. government will go broke, having no money to pay bills this Thursday, should an agreement not be reached. Despite several senior Democratic and Republican Party leaders meeting Sunday in Washington, it does not appear any progress has been made in negotiations. The Senate needs to hold tough,' Speaker of the House John Boehner (R-OH) told House GOP lawmakers. 'The president now isn't negotiating with us.’ Those words came as news of talks breaking down even further infuriate Americans, sparking a march Sunday through Washington, D.C. of veterans protesting the closure of several monuments. Working on it: Democratic Senate Majority Leader from Nevada Harry Reid speaks Saturday on negotiations over the Debt Limit Bill . Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) also lamented the lack of progress. 'I was happy to see the Republicans engaged in talks with the president, the House Republicans. That’s over with. It’s done. They’re not talking anymore,' Reid said. 'I say to my friends on the Republican side of this Senate, time is running out.' President Barack Obama voiced his exasperation with the situation on his weekly radio address. Democratic braintrust: U.S. President Barack Obama (2nd L) meets with Senate Democratic leadership, including (L-R) Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY), Senate Majority Whip Sen. Richard Durbin (D-IL), and Senate Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) ‘It doesn't have to be this way. It's not supposed to be this way,’ the president said, adding ‘Manufacturing crises to extract massive concessions isn't how our democracy works, and we have to stop it.’ Referring to Republicans’ unwillingness to discuss anything unless Obamacare is defunded, Mr Obama said that ‘politics is a battle of ideas, but you advance those ideas through elections and legislation - not extortion.’ Christine Lagarde, International Monetary Fund chief, shared her concerns with NBC’s ‘Meet the press.’ ‘If there is that degree of disruption, that lack of certainty, that lack of trust in the US signature, it would mean massive disruption the world over,’ she told the program. Also working on it: Republican Speaker of the House from Ohio, John Boehner (center) leaves a Republican conference Saturday in the US Capitol . ‘We would be at risk of tipping, yet again, into recession,’ she added. Xinhua took further shots and the U.S., despite China being the largest foreign holder of U.S. debt. ‘Such alarming days when the destinies of others are in the hands of a hypocritical nation have to be terminated,’ the news agency ranted. ‘The cyclical stagnation in Washington for a viable bipartisan solution over a federal budget and an approval for raising debt ceiling has again left many nations’ tremendous dollar assets in jeopardy and the international community highly agonised,’ the commentary furthered. China holds $1.28trillion in U.S. Treasury bonds – an American government default is four days away, unless politicians can make a deal. Xinhua ended by passing along advice most Americans would likely agree with - 'it is suggested that the beltway politicians first begin with ending the pernicious impasse.'","The Chinese government issued the criticisms through the state-run Xinhua News Agency .

Ministry, which is in charge of police, said Lunn was detained on August . 27 during 'combing operations' that followed a car bombing outside a . police station in the turbulent northern region of Sinai. It said a computer and maps of 'important installations' were found in his possession, but did not identify the facilities. On alert: Egyptian soldiers search cars at a makeshift checkpoint during the curfew hours. A US citizen arrested for violating the restrictions has been found dead in his police cell in a suspected suicide (file picture) Lunn, it continued, was remanded in police custody and was remanded again for 30 days by a court on Saturday. In . Washington, the State Department said U.S. consular officials in Cairo . were informed of his arrest on August 28, a day after the Egyptians . detained him. Consular officials had been in touch with Egyptian authorities and Lunn since, it said. He . was found hanged on Sunday at the door of the bathroom of his cell . block in an Ismailia police station. Lunn had a visit from a U.S. consulate official last Tuesday, it added. A coroner has been appointed to determine the cause of death, the statement said. Security officials earlier said he was a retired U.S. Army officer, a claim denied by the State Department. Lunn arrived in Cairo from the Gulf kingdom of Bahrain on August 25, Egyptian officials said. Held: Egyptian officials said Lunn was detained by army troops in Sinai three days later while making his way to the border crossing with Gaza in the town of Rafah (above, file picture) They . had said he was detained by army troops in Sinai three days later while . making his way to the border crossing with Gaza in the town of Rafah.

The Interior . Ministry and the security officials earlier mistakenly identified the . American as James Henry Allen and James Henry. Such confusion is common . in Egypt in the case of foreign names that are transliterated from . English, often with some liberty. The . American is the second foreigner to die in Egyptian custody since last . month. Then, authorities said cell mates beat a French man to death . after his arrest in Cairo's upscale district of Zamalek for violating . curfew. The latest death is . likely to revive the furor about poor conditions and human rights . violations in Egyptian jails.

Unrest: A riot police officer, on an armoured personnel carrier surrounded by anti-Morsi protesters, fires rubber bullets at supporters of the ousted Egyptian President in recent clashes . However, the . State Department said Lunn had at no time complained to U.S. consular . officials that he had been maltreated by the Egyptians. It confirmed the . Egyptians' claim that Lunn was last visited by a U.S. consular officer . on October 8. The .

Short supply: Hospital bosses have been forced abroad in their hunt for staff (file photo) One in three hospitals is bringing in nurses from abroad because wards are so understaffed, an investigation has found. NHS managers are travelling to countries including Poland, Greece, Spain, Portugal, India and the Philippines in the drive to recruit nurses. But concerns have been raised over the English-speaking abilities of some foreign staff, while others may lack training and experience. And MPs and campaigners say it is absurd some hospitals are making nurses redundant or have imposed recruitment freezes while others are desperately having to poach them from abroad. Separate figures from the Nursing and Midwifery Council show the number of foreign nurses coming to work in Britain has doubled in just three years, up from 2,306 to 4,521. This means nearly a fifth of the 25,500 new nurses registering each year are from abroad. An investigation by Nursing Times using Freedom of Information requests found that 40 out of 105 hospital trusts have actively recruited nurses from abroad within the past 12 months. In total they had poached some 1,360 nurses from abroad. But over the past few years concerns have been raised over the poor language and medical skills of nurses – and doctors – working for the NHS, with some patients claiming they have had to use sign language. Some of Britain’s foremost doctors have expressed their own frustration – including Lord Winston, a fertility specialist, who warned that nurses from Eastern Europe have been ‘trained in a completely different way’. Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association said: ‘In all of the caring services, good communications is vitally important for a number of reasons. ‘If language issues prevent this level of communication then clearly patient care will suffer and safety is compromised.’ The NMC’s figures also show three quarters of the foreign nurses that registered to work in Britain last year were from European countries and therefore did not face language or skills checks. Influx: Figures have revealed that one in three hospitals are bringing in foreign nurses, who now make up a fifth of all newly-registered nurses . EU rules prohibit such tests being carried out on nurses from member states as they are deemed a threat to ‘freedom of labour’. Only last month research by Kings College London found more than 40 per cent of hospital wards did not have enough nurses to run safely. And this summer an investigation into hospitals with the highest death rates by the NHS medical director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh found evidence of widespread nursing shortages. Although the numbers of nurses working in the NHS increased by more than a fifth under Labour, over the past three years they have begun falling again. Figures show there are now 5,000 fewer posts compared to April 2010 and some trusts have been making staff redundant. A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘Recruiting from abroad is nothing new. Overseas nurses make a very valuable contribution to NHS patient care. 'However, they should only ever work in the NHS if they have proven their competence and language skills.’","40 out of 105 hospital trusts are recruiting from abroad, new figures show .

A mother is 'disgusted' with Sainsbury's after she gave her one-year-old daughter a chicken kiev and found an inch-long shard of saw blade embedded in it. Sophie Perks bought the ready meal from her local supermarket as a quick dinner for her child Maddison-Faithe. But as the 22-year-old cut the meal up on her daughter's high chair plate she was stunned when her knife hit a sharp slither of razor-sharp metal. Shock discovery: Sophie Perks, 22, with her partner Jordan Langstaff, 22, and daughter Madison-Faith, who was almost fed a chicken kiev containing a saw blade . Chilling: This is the inch-long shard found embedded in the meal, which looks similar to a hacksaw blade . When she examined the food she was shocked when she discovered a jagged shard of metal. The mother-of-one was enraged when she returned to the branch in Church Gresley, Derbyshire, to find they could offer no explanation for how the blade got into the dish. She was offered another pack of £2.50 kievs as an apology for the incident which happened on October 5. The data manager at a cancer research firm is calling for an urgent investigation into the source of the blade - to make sure no one else suffers the same fate. Miss Perks, of Swadlincote, Derbyshire said: 'I was in a rush that evening because it was my sister Molly's 18th birthday in Tamworth and so we hadn't got any time to go shopping. Offending ready meal: Miss Perks had bought the twin-pack of fresh kievs from a nearby Sainsbury's local as a quick dinner for her one-year-old daughter, but felt the metal when she cut into it . 'I popped in to the store and grabbed a two pack of kievs, the fresh ones not frozen, so my daughter could have dinner. Apology: Sainsbury's say they have launched an investigation and the store the family bought it from gave her two more free . 'When we got home I cooked them both and when they were done I cut one up on Maddison's plate and heard a clink when my knife hit something. 'I picked it up to check what had made the noise and the razor blade fell from the bottom. 'I was disgusted, if I hadn't heard the clunk I would have just served it up - I dread to think what could have happened. 'I took it back to the shop and the deputy manager was very apologetic, they gave me some new ones, which I checked in the shop and said the manager would contact me. 'When he did all he could say was that they could only offer their sincere apologies and were looking into the matter. 'I wanted to know how it got in there but they couldn't tell me. 'This needs to be looked into as soon as possible. If it is because of something from the manufacture or the machines then there needs to be a recall. 'I dread to think what could have happened. 'I will never be shopping at Sainsbury's again, it puts you off, if they could have offered an explanation or made it clear it would never happen again I might, but not now.' The supermarket giant is now investigating the claims. A Sainsbury's spokeswoman said: 'We have started a thorough investigation and apologised to Miss Perks for the inconvenience caused. 'Incidents like this are extremely rare as we have the highest standards and carry out quality control checks at all stages of production.'","Sophie Perks sliced into Maddison-Faithe's dinner and felt it with her knife .

A man who claims a makeshift cemetery he created in his front garden is 'modern art' has horrified his neighbours with the sinister build. The homeowner, known only as Mark, lined the driveway of his home in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear with six gravestones last Monday - in time for Halloween. Although the man, who has lived in the house for 14 years, claims they are 'modern art', his neighbours have said they are now having nightmares and branded them 'disgusting'. Creepy: A man who claims the graveyard he installed in his front garden is 'modern art' has horrified his neighbours in Tyne and Wear with his odd build . Bizarre: The man, known only as Mark, created the makeshift cemetery of six graves last Monday . It is thought the man, who neighbours say is seldom seen, employed people from a nearby cemetery to create the graveyard. One neighbour, who wished to remain anonymous said: 'I want them down, they're awful. 'I think it's totally disgusting and it's awful when you have to come out and look at them, it really is. I've had nightmares about it. 'He came out and said, ""What do you think? Do you like my modern art?"" 'I said, ""No, I don't like them, it's like a graveyard"". I really don't know what's going through his head putting them up.' Graveyard: The new addition includes this rather sinister grave that appears to be a book with C? printed on it . Odd: One graves features a memorial book of with extract from both Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, left, and a quote from horror film Night of the Living Dead on the other, right . Unsettling: Another smaller grave features the words 'believe in nothing' in a downwards triangle . George Hall, 76, a retired boiler-maker, said: 'I think it's a bit daft. I don't know what he's thinking - you don't see him much.

An American banker risked his life to save his Vietnamese colleagues just days before communist Vietcong guerrillas took control of Saigon. John Riordon rescued over 100 of his colleagues as terrifying rumours spread of a civilian massacre, by pretending they were his wives and children on evacuation forms. They now live prosperous lives as American citizens with children who are doctors and lawyers, and with grandchildren. The tale of bravery began after Mr Riordon was posted as an assistant manager to Citibank in Saigon in 1975. He developed a close relationship with his 34 co-workers and their families and hosted barbecues at his villa. But . that April, just three weeks before Saigon fell - now known as Ho Chi . Minh City - Mr Riordan was ordered by Citibank in New York to burn all . the important files and leave immediately. Reliving . the traumatic time, he told CBS News: 'They said, ""John, we've . chartered a 747 Pan Am that's coming in. And we want to take all of your . staff and leave the bank and get out to this plane.'"" Mr . Riordan realised that the bank's 34 Vietnamese employees, tellers, . secretaries, accountants would be left in a dangerous situation once he . left -  there were rumours of reprisals by the Viet Cong against anyone . working for the Americans. He attempted to draw up a plan with his Citibank bosses in Hong Kong to . evacuate them including trying to send in helicopters and even an oil . tanker. But . after exhausting all possible options, including asking the U.S . government for help, the team were told in no uncertain terms that if . they tried to carry out a daring rescue mission they would be fired. But . then Mr Riordon's immediate boss, Mike McTighe, a former US marine told . told him that one of the pair needed to go back to help. Reunited: Mr Riordon with his his co-workers and their families who he helped rescue from Saigon . Determined: Faced with the prospect of losing his job or saving his friends, Mr Riordon caught the last commercial flight in Saigon in a desperate rescue mission . Faced with the prospect of losing . his job or saving his friends, Mr Riordon caught the last commercial . flight in Saigon in a desperate rescue mission. He . then set about formulating a plan just 11 days before the fall, moving . his former co-workers and their families - 105 in total - into his villa . and another one nearby. Four . days later Mr Riordon was told by a CIA agent that now the only way to . escape Vietnam was on a U.S. military cargo plane that was evacuating . Americans and their dependents. Mr . Riordon reminisced: 'He says, ""The evacuation has been begun. Take your . family and go out to the airport and process them through."" 'And . I said, 'Well, I don't have a family.' And he said, ""Just create a wife . and children, no matter who they are, and go out there and sign the . documents."" ' Determined . to try to save the group Mr Riordon took a bank van to an airfield and . filled out a form certifying on a U.S. government document that he had a . Vietnamese wife and 14 children - even though on closer inspection some . of the children were actually older than him. Fall: North Vietnamese soldiers running past destroyed aircraft on the tarmac of Saigon's Tan Son Nhat airport after Communist troops shelled the airport. Several hours later Saigon fell into the the hands of the Communist troops, marking an end to the Vietnam war . Capture: A 30 April 1975 photo shows a line of captured US-backed South Vietnamese Army soldiers, escorted by Vietnamese communist soldiers, as they walk on a Saigon street after the city fell into the hands of the communist troops . Evacuation: The last U.S. Marine helicopter lifts off from the landing pad atop the U.S. Embassy during the evacuation of Saigon . After signing a ceasefire, the last American troops left Vietnam in March 1973, almost 58,000 are dead, and over 1,000 are missing in action. Some 150,000 Americans were seriously wounded. But the unrest continues as southern and northern forces are accused each other of breaking the terms of the truce and fighting continues. The north make progressive gains and the south's defences weaken as the US withdraws aid - Hanoi launches an offensive to gain control of the whole country. The south Vietnamese army crumble faster than expected and millions of refugees fled towards Saigon. On 21 April, the South Vietnamese President Nguyen Van Thieu resigns and flees to Taiwan. Six days later the city was surrounded and on 29 April the US ordered the helicopter evacuation of 7,000 American administrators and South Vietnamese from the city. Refugees battled to join the exodus. The following day, NVA tanks drove unopposed into central Saigon. The city was renamed Ho Chi Minh City. A Vietnamese man, left, is punched by an American while trying to board the last helicopter . He then went and picked the group up and they were flown out of the country to safety. Over . the next four days as fear gripped the city, John repeated this ruse 10 times, filling out papers with . groups of six or eight. The . women and children were all transported out safely, but it was even . more risky to help the husbands that were left behind as they were more . of a target. Mr Riordon managed to get them all fake adoption papers as his sons and they took a U.S. embassy evacuation bus to the airport. But they were terrified when the bus . was stopped at a checkpoint and a Vietnamese police officer stepped on . the bus to carry out an inspection. A . Vietnamese women jumped up and shoved a bag containing a bribe into his . hands and the bus moved on to airport safely. The group were one of . the last to fly out of Saigon - after that the only method of escape were . the helicopters at the U.S. embassy. Later . that week the Vietcong and North Vietnamese Army took over and raised . their flag over the South Vietnamese presidential palace . The fall of Saigon, two years after American troops left Vietnam, is seen by many as the final day of the Vietnam war. The Citibank employees were flown out to either Guam or the Philippines and then all reunited at Camp Pendleton in California. Despite defying his company's orders on his return Mr Riordon was hailed a hero and given a bonus. Citibank also spent a million dollars to resettle all the employees, giving them and many of the spouses, jobs. Recently Mr Riordon and his 'family' met up in Long Island - his 'children' call him 'Papa.' Chi . Vu, one of the women he saved told CBS: 'He's so kind, you know, to . stay behind and take-- took us out. He did so much for us. Saved my kids . and my husband.' Tens . of tens of thousands of South Vietnamese civilians associated with the . southern regime were evacuated in the days preceding the capture of . Saigon.

To solve this first world problem, a company has created the Smartphone Remote Control that syncs with an app and lets people take photos of themselves from 10 feet away. A stand even positions the phone at the correct angle, in both portrait and landscape modes, spelling the end of shaky photos and trying to balance the phone and press the shutter at the same time. The Smartphone Camera Remote, pictured, costs £14.99 and includes a stand that rests the handset at the perfect angle in both portrait and landscape. The wireless range is quoted as 10 feet, although tests have shown it can work at more than three times this distance . Wireless range: 10 feet - although tests have shown it can work up to 32 feet .

A football mad father-of-one who underwent a sex change following an attempt to cut off his own penis with a Stanley knife has said that he now appreciates football for an entirely different reason! Kirsty Cass, 51, used to be a Manchester United-obsessed macho man called Andy who enjoyed nothing better than watching a game with a few beers. However following a bungled DIY sex operation - where Andy tried to cut his own penis off - she is now a woman following a successful procedure on the NHS in 2011. Write caption here . Andy (left) underwent a sex change operation to become Kirsty (right) after nearly dying attempting to remove his own penis with a Stanley knife . Andy, pictured when Manchester United won the treble in 1999,used to regularly go to watch his team at Old Trafford . Kirsty, of Crawley, West Sussex, admits her transformation had a strange side effect, reporting she doesn’t enjoy football anymore but instead fancies the players - with her favourite pin up Manchester United's star Robin Van Persie. Kirsty said: 'I used to go to Old Trafford all the time. Being a football fan and going to matches was part of trying to be one of the boys. 'The other day at work I had to ask a colleague what the match result was from the night before - back then I would have known exactly what it was. Kristy says now rather than enjoying the game of football, she is more interested in Robin Van Persie (right) 'I don’t have even a ladies Manchester United shirt - I buy blouses in shops like Jane Norman now. 'I follow them casually, but I am more interested in the good looking players like Robin Van Persie - he’s a bit of alright. 'I used to be all Manu - but there is only one Persie I’m interested in now.' Kirsty is now successfully living as a woman after her sex change and says she has never been happier- but has no idea what is going on with Man United . Nowadays Kristy is more likely to be seen in a  Jane Norman blouse or mini skirt than a football shirt . Kirsty once almost died after drunkenly trying to chop-off Andy's manhood off with a craft knife.She . recalled: 'The pain was unbelievable. It took a couple of minutes . before I quickly sobered-up. I grabbed a hankie and tried to stem to . stem the bleeding and dialed 999. 'I . don’t remember what happened next, just waking up in hospital and . realising my penis was still there. Doctors explained they had to . reattach it.' Kirsty wore women’s clothes for years to prove she was serious about the £12,000 operation and changed her name by deed poll. Kristy says even as a child she knew something was different . Following surgery earlier this year at a clinic in Charing Cross, central London, Kirsty has started dating men. She said: 'I always tried to be one of the boys, but I knew from a young age I had been born in the wrong body. 'At primary school there were two sheds that the kids used to play in. There was one for the girls and one for the boys and I would always be in the girls one. 'I used to have girlfriends - but only because that is what the other boys did. I would drink pints and look at girls to fit in. 'The other boys would be looking at girls in a sexual way but I would be thinking about how their outfits would look on me.' Kirsty was married to Linda Woodhouse, 45, and they had a daughter Jodie, now 23, but realised she was living a lie just six years after she was born. She said: 'Now, I feel fantastic. It feels so natural. I ooze confidence - I am so happy with how I look. 'I have lost some friends on the way, but I have gained better ones.

The Statue of Liberty in New York City reopens today after being closed Oct.1 during the federal government shutdown. Ferry service from Battery Park to Liberty Island resumed at 9 a.m. and tickets went on sale at 8:30 a.m. But the Obama administration's OK to . reopen parks closed by the government shutdown came with a big caveat: . States must foot the bill with money they likely won't see again. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced . on Friday that the . state will pay $61,600 a day to fully fund Park Service personnel and . keep the Statue of Liberty open through Oct.17. If government issues are . not resolved by then, they will discuss keeping it open further. The statue opened for tours today after the state governor of New York approved state funds for the reopening despite an ongoing government shutdown . This is the first time Lady Liberty opened since the government shutdown on Oct.1 . Tourists pass by the Statue of Liberty in a boat that circles landmarks in New York harbor . 'We're glad to be up and running to . Liberty Island,' said Statue Cruises marketing director Rafael Abreu. His company ferries 7,000 to 10,000 passengers. During the shutdown his . business was reduced by 60 per cent. National Park Spokesman John Warren said that Liberty Island tickets bought on closure days will be honored but that the space inside the crown is limited. Tourists should check to make sure that there are still tickets available. The Statue of Liberty is one of 33 park sites under the jurisdiction of the National Park Service. Ellis Island is one of those sites but has remained closed for repairs since Hurricane Sandy. Arizona opened Grand Canyon National Park on Saturday after the state along with several counterparts agreed to a federal government plan. The US state of Utah began re-opening its national parks like the Grand Canyon and Bryce Canyon (pictured here) on October 11, 2013 after striking a deal with federal authorities . The Grand Canyon re-opened on Saturday after it was closed during the federal government shutdown . So far, Utah, Colorado, South . Dakota, Arizona and New York have agreed. Governors in other states were . trying to gauge what would be the bigger economic hit - paying to keep . the parks operating or losing the tourist money that flows when the . scenic attractions are open. South Dakota and several corporate donors worked out a deal with the National Park Service to reopen Mount Rushmore beginning Monday. Gov. Dennis Daugaard said it will cost $15,200 a day to pay the federal government to run the landmark in the Black Hills.He said he wired four days' worth of the donations on Friday. States like Utah decided to pay to keep parks open because the cost of losing tourism would damage the local economy . Even the bathrooms at the main entrance to Grand Canyon National Park were closed until Saturday . Arizona officials said a deal reached Friday meant visitors got to visit Grand Canyon National Park yesterday.Arizona Republican Gov. Jan Brewer balked at spending about $112,000 a day for a full reopening of the Grand Canyon. She said a partial reopening would be much cheaper while allowing tourists to visit and businesses to benefit.'The daily cost difference is enormous, especially without assurances that Arizona will be reimbursed,' said Andrew Wilder, a spokesman for Brewer. Park rangers had to explain to disappointed visitors that the park was closed . Visitors to Zion National Park take in the sights after the park re-opened . In the end, Arizona agreed to pay the Park Service $651,000 to keep the Grand Canyon open for seven days. The $93,000 a day is less than the $112,000 the federal government had said was needed to fund park operations each day.In additional to state money, cash provided by the town of Tusayan, just outside the South Rim entrance, and private business would also be included in the funding.At this time of year, the Grand Canyon draws about 18,000 people a day who pump an estimated $1 million a day into the local economy. The town of Tusayan, and area businesses have pledged $400,000 to help reopen the canyon, but Wilder said it was unclear if the Interior Department could accept private funds.In Utah, federal workers rushed to reopen five national parks for 10 days after the state sent $1.67 million to the U.S. government with the hope of saving its lucrative tourist season.Zion National Park superintendent Jock Whitworth said staff members began opening gates and removing barriers and expected to have the park fully operational Saturday.'This is a practical and temporary solution that will lessen the pain for some businesses and communities in Utah during this shutdown,' Interior Department Secretary Sally Jewell said in a statement. New york will pay $61,000 a day to keep the Statue of Liberty open . If the government shutdown is not resolved by Oct.17 then officials will discuss keeping Lady Liberty open . It was welcome news for beleaguered shop owners in the small town of Springdale adjacent to Zion. Hotels have been vacant and rental and retail shops have seen sales plummet during the shutdown.'It's going to be awesome,' said Jenna Milligan of Zion Outfitters, an outdoor gear rental shop. 'A lot of businesses have suffered severely because of the government. I just hope it does stay open through autumn.' In Colorado, officials said a deal had been struck for the state to pay $360,000 to reopen Rocky Mountain National Park for 10 days to allow tourists to reach Estes Park. The visitors are needed to help the town recover from flooding. Just over 400 national parks, recreation areas and monuments - including such icons as the Grand Canyon and Yosemite - have been closed since Oct. 1 because of the partial government shutdown. More than 20,000 National Park Service employees have been furloughed, and lawmakers from both parties have complained that the closures have wreaked havoc on communities that depend on tourism. Interior Department spokesman Blake Androff said Thursday the government had no plans to reimburse states that pay to reopen parks. But members of Congress introduced legislation Friday to refund the money within 90 days. In Utah, Herbert estimated the economic impact of the federal government shutdown at $100 million in his state.","Ferry service from Battery Park to Liberty Island resumed at 9 a.m. and tickets went on sale at 8:30 a.m.

With a high-profile figure urging us to indulge in eating dead animals off the side of the road, the practice is no longer the taboo it once was. Miranda Krestovnikoff, 40, has said: 'It’s lean, healthy, organic, free, guilt-free and as fresh as fresh can be.' The new president of bird conservation charity RSPB, and long-standing BBC presenter, even cooked roadkill for a recent dinner party. The occasion, to be broadcast tonight, features fried rat carcass picked up from the B3347 near Sopley in the New Forest; and sautéed fox from the Ferndown bypass near Wimborne, Dorset. Badger from the A354 near Salisbury was also served, with chasseur tomato sauce and croutons. After hosting her unusual dinner party for friends she said: 'It would be good to encourage it more widely. 'I don’t see why not. People have a problem with it because the meat has not come from a cellophane wrapper. 'But . if the meat is fresh, there’s no risk of catching anything. It’s lean, . healthy, organic, free, guilt-free and as fresh as fresh can be. 'We need to know what we’re eating and where it is coming from and this allows you to do that. 'It . is a chance to get connected to what you eat. We’re obsessed by sell-by . dates and things like that. But roadkill can be eaten very . hygienically. People are too squeamish,' she said, as reported in the Telegraph. The RSPB's . more than one million members might be surprised to learn . Krestovnikoff, who was announced as their new face just last week, is . championing the eating of British roadkill. The . presenter has told how she wants more people to source their meat not . from a local supermarket or specialist butchers, but rather, from the . roadside. Miranda cooked rat, fox and badger roadkill for dinner party guests - and says we should all indulge . Krestovnikoff, who has appeared on Coast, The One Show and Britain's Big Wildlife Revival, began eating roadkill after spotting a dead pheasant on the roadside near her family home near Bristol. She butchers the meat herself with her husband Nicholas, who runs a publishing company. They make sausages form the offcuts and leave the rest outside for animals to scavenge. They now keep a tarpaulin sheet in their car allowing them to pick up any suitable carcasses that they see. One of the first deer Krestovnikoff recovered was one she spotted while heading home from school with her children. She says while other parents at the school gate thought it was odd, she doesn't 'go looking' for it, but is she sees it she will swoop it up and is happy to feed the meat to her children, aged five and seven, and they are aware of its origins . Other celebrity and famous foodie . advocates include Janet Street-Porter, celebrity chef Hugh . Fearnley-Whittingstall and presenter and farmer Jimmy Doherty. It is legal to eat roadkill, provided the animals have been run over accidentally and the meat is not sold. The Food Standards Agency, though, advises against eating roadkill, saying the animals may not have been healthy when killed and may have been suffering from disease or environmental contamination and if left on the roadside for too long, harmful levels of bacteria, such as salmonella, E. coli and Clostridium botulinum, could grow. Krestovnikoff’s dinner party will be shown on BBC One’s Inside Out tonight at 7.30pm.","Miranda Krestovnikoff is new face of Rainham Marshes Nature Reserve .

The world's most expensive morphsuit has been unveiled, and it will cost the wearer an astonishing £1 million. The 'Million Pound Morph' creation promises to fit like a glove, as well as being breathable and easy to see through, and of course impressing your friends as you drip with over 20,000 diamonds. The suit would certainly set the wearer apart on Halloween, and promises to 'fit like a glove' Costume company, Morphsuits, has come up with the latest design, which uses a grey spandex costume as the base, before painstakingly attaching the precious stones.

Several witnesses were at the scene and called for emergency help. The bystanders also whipped out their phones to take a picture of the rare sight. Ms McGowan was wearing all pink and later told police that she had participated in a breast cancer walk earlier that morning at nearby Huizenga Plaza. 'She was just in this Jesus Chris position,' witness Phillip Glazebrook told the Sun-Sentinel. 'The woman was frozen and terrified. I'm sure she must have been in absolute shock to be stuck in that position.' Mr Glazebrook wasn't surprised that the crowd took out their phones to document the incident. 'It was like watching an accident on 1-95, rubbernecking,' he said. 'She's stuck up there and they're just taking photos and videos.' A Fort Lauderdale Fire Rescue crew responded at 10:44am and they were able to safely rescue her. Firefighters used a 24-foot ladder to rescue the woman, who was approximately 22 feet in the air.

'To tell you the truth, honestly I thought it was probably like a stunt or something, it was just that unbelievable,' witness Ashanicka Powell told NBC Miami. 'I really didn't think she honestly was trapped up there at first.' 'They harnessed the ladder up against the actual tracks and a firefighter went and got her and we were all clapping, we were just amazed' Ms Powell said.

Japan has reportedly struck a deal to sell millions of pounds worth of machinery to the Royal Navy. Approving the move, the Japanese government said to would not violate Tokyo's policy against arms sales. The gas turbine parts will be manufactured by Kawasaki Heavy Industries, a name associated more around the world with top quality, high-speed motorcycles. HMS Kent: The Japanese government said the deal will not contravene Tokyo's anti-arms selling policy because the gas turbines are 'not regarded as weapons' The parts are to be produced for Rolls-Royce, which has a manufacturing co-operation arrangement with Kawasaki, and RR will then supply them to the navy, according to Japan's business daily Nikkei and Kyodo News. 'The parts are not regarded as weapons,' said a government spokesman. 'They are to be used in navy ships as well as in civilian aircraft and in emergency generators.'  No further comment was available today as Japan is enjoying a public holiday. But Kawasaki has pointed out through Kyodo that it has been making the engine parts for its own naval defence force and other users under license from Rolls-Royce. Bike maker: The parts will be manufactured by Kawasaki Heavy Industries, a name associated more around the world with top quality, high-speed motorcycles . The report in Kyodo said Rolls-Royce stopped making the components for the Royal Navy but when replacements were needed the navy ordered them from Kawasaki. The Royal Navy, said the report, asked Japan's naval defence force to examine whether the export of the parts would contravene Tokyo's policy against arms sales. The Nikkei daily said Japan was looking to increase exports of such dual-use technology, which would help the the country's defence industry increase output and cut down on production costs. Not weapons: Japan's giant helicopter destroyer DDH183 Izumo was launched in August this year. Under its constitution, Japan cannot sell weapons to communist states, countries subject to UN embargoes and nations involved in international conflicts . 'Such exports can also help Japan forge stronger defence ties with friendly countries,' said the daily. A policy adopted in 1967, and strengthened nine years later, resulted in Japan prohibiting weapons sales to communist states, countries which are subject to embargoes under UN resolutions and nations involved in international conflicts. Such ban, on the face of it, would seem to involve Britain, which still has troops in Afghanistan. But one country which would have no hope of receiving machinery of any kind from Japan is its belligerent neighbour, North Korea.","Japanese government says deal would not violate policy against arms sales .

Titled A Friend To The Sick - The Englishmans Preservation, it was written by Royal Physician William Sermon (Auctioneer and valuer Isabell Murtough is pictured with the book) It was written in 1673 by Royal Physician, William Sermon, who was a physician of Charles II. In the book, Dr Sermon states: 'Sickness is a convulsion which will most . commonly deprive the patient of reason and sense, caused by tough flegm . which doth obstruct the passage of the spirit of the brain.'

Adam Downworth, 32, of Stockport, was given 10 life sentences after being convicted of a string of rape and sexual assault charges . An office cleaner who hunted down and attacked young women walking home alone at night was given ten life sentences today. Serial rapist Adam Downworth, 32, cruised the streets in his Citroen Berlingo so he could deliberately spot and ambush lone victims who had been drinking with friends. After selecting his target, Downworth would park his van before stalking and creeping up on the women on secluded roads and public parks. He incapacitated them using throttling manoeuvres he learnt from his martial arts books before subjecting the victims to sadistic sexual attacks as they came round and pleading for mercy. One woman who begged Downworth to take her purse and mobile phone was told: 'Look at my eyes. 'It’s all about teaching little bitches like you that they can’t walk on the street on their own when there’s men like me about. 'It’s not about the money. If it was about money, I’d have took it by now.' Another victim suffered several facial fractures after being kicked about the head and raped twice. She feared she would die during a 30-minute ordeal as Downworth told her: 'You’re all dirty b******. No-one will look at you again.' Downworth claimed five victims during his 10-month reign of terror across Stockport and Manchester before being captured in September last year. Whilst he was on the loose, drunken and vulnerable women found walking alone at night were stopped and given lifts home by police in patrol cars to avoid them becoming his next victims. During a raid officers found a library of martial arts books at the home of Downworth’s mother including Secrets of the Ninja, The Invisible Ninja: Ancient Secrets of Surprise, and Knights of Darkness. Scroll down for video . Police found these books on ninja fighting techniques and forensics among others belonging to the rapist . One of Downworth's victims was attacked in Alexandra Park in the rapist's hometown of Stockport . Chapters on choking and strangling and how to stage surprise attacks were highlighted in pencil. One passage told how a combatant in a martial contest could be incapacitated in just three seconds. It emerged Downworth was also a Facebook troll who used a victim’s mobile phone to scour the social media site for other women so he could send them filthy messages. One read: 'Dya really fink ur so atraktive, ha. U dres like a s*** so just luk cheap like a hooker u don’t pay.' Today there were shouts from the public gallery at Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester, of: 'Rot in hell' and 'I hope you die a slow death' as Downworth, of Brinnington, was ordered to serve a minimum of 23 years in jail. He was convicted of 13 charges including rape, attempted rape, assault by penetration and assault occasioning actual and grievous bodily harm. CCTV shows Downworth leaving his flat in Brinnington, Stockport, on his way to commit his final sex attack . Stills from the CCTV show Downworth leaving his home in the Stockport suburb and looking for his next victim . Rapist's sick library: Titles belonging to Downworth including Attacking Judo, Ground Fighting, and Grips . Police fear there may have been other victims who were too frightened to come forward. The court heard how victims suffered serious injuries and long-lasting psychological harm as a result of the attacks, in which Downworth would wear blue surgical gloves from his workplace to avoid his fingerprints being found at the scene of his crimes. Alaric Bassano, prosecuting said: 'On each of the occasions he cruised the streets in his works van seeking out vulnerable lone females in secluded locations. 'Once he had identified victims, he discreetly parked his van and pursued them on foot, either attacking them from behind or lying in wait until they crossed his path. 'A striking feature of these attacks is the use of gratuitous violence against his victims, violence beyond that necessity to fulfil his sexual purpose and seemingly unleashed simply to increase the suffering of the women. Alexandra Park in Stockport was one of the locations of his attacks - he also attacked women in Manchester . This CCTV still shows Downworth, 32, following his future victim along Nangreave Road in Stockport . Downworth, seen here following his intended prey, is now serving 10 life sentences for a string of sex crimes . Terrifying: Downworth would stalk his victims in his van at night before parking and creeping up to throttle them . 'He spoke in hateful and degrading ways whilst attacking them and appeared to be deriving sadistic pleasure from their suffering.' The first victim, 28, who had been drinking with a friend was attacked at 2.50am on December 3 2011 as she crossed bridge over a reservoir at Alexandra Park in Edgeley, near Stockport. She was attacked from behind and grabbed in a headlock before being told: 'Don’t move or I’ll stab you - you know what’s going to happen to you - don’t you.' He then choked the woman until she lost consciousness before sexually assaulting her as she lay helpless on the floor - then beating her about the face. A second woman, 26, was grabbed the following April as she walked home from a takeaway but he fled with her handbag when she screamed for her partner. This shows Downworth creeping towards his van as he heads off to commit what would be his last crime . Manchester's Minshull Street Crown Court: Today Downworth was given 10 life sentences there . In May 2012, the third victim, 22, was attacked as she walked home at 1am after socialising with friends. She said she was attacked by two men with Downworth ripping off her clothes and telling her:'I’m not going to hury you. If you s*** me off it will be all over.' A fourth victim, 28, was attacked in the early hours of 1 July 2012 as she walked home through Debdale Park in Gorton after a drinking session with friends. The final known victim, 48, was raped at 1am on September 16 after she left a bar in Stockport. 'So many times I've blamed myself and wondered why it was me.' - one of Downworth's five victims . He attacked her from behind before dragging her by the hair and then ankles down a secluded footpath before raping her twice adding: 'I’ll have to kill you now.' The woman managed to break free and ran to horrified passersby. Downworth was spotted fleeing the area and police arrested him close to his van. He was linked to the previous attacks by CCTV footage of his van, petrol receipts and tracking of his mobile phones. Two mobile phones stolen from victims were also later found at his home. One victim said later: 'On the night of the attack my life was turned upside down and I have never been the same since. So many times I’ve blamed myself and wondered why it was me. When I went back to work I kept bursting into tears so I had to give up my job. 'Some of my hair even began to fall out with all the stress. It got to the point where I tried to kill myself.' 'You are to be regarded as dangerous and...there is a serious risk of harm to members of the public.' - Judge Jeffrey Lewis . Downworth claimed he was a street mugger who had not sexually assaulted any victims, and invented a fictitious accomplice who he blamed for the more serious sexual attacks. But Judge Jeffrey Lewis told him: 'You are to be regarded as dangerous and it is as clear to me as it possibly could be that there is a serious risk of harm to members of the public. 'Even your own counsel conceded that these women were attacked and degraded in a horrible way.' After the case Detective Inspector Rebecca Matthews said: 'Downworth subject these women to some of the most appalling attacks I have seen in my policing career. 'The library of books at his home gave a chilling insight into his personality and thought processes, ranging from research on law surrounding sexual offences to hiding your true personality from others. 'Due to the serious nature of his offending, it is possible there may be other victims that have not come forward to police for whatever reason. If this is the case, I would urge them to do so.' She added: 'When we arrested Downworth, we found a library of books at his home that gave a chilling insight into his personality and thought processes, ranging from research on law surrounding sexual offences to hiding your true personality from others.'","Adam Downworth, 32, attacked five women in Manchester and Stockport .

Officers in Glasgow had hired a Mitchell’s Self-Drive van to be used by plain clothes police in an undercover drugs bust. But they forgot to clear the haul out of the vehicle before they called the firm to come and pick the van up after the operation, and the rental firm only discovered the mistake when they got it back to their Glasgow depot. Stone me: John McKinnon of Mitchell's van hire in Rutherglen found bag-loads of marijuana in the van police rented . John McKinnon, 33, from Mitchell's, said: 'There were bin bags full of cannabis. There was no mistaking what it was. I went running into the office and we phoned the police. 'Straight away, they said someone was going to get their b**** kicked. But it still took them an hour-and-a-half to come back out to collect it.' Police in Lanarkshire had hired the unmarked van for use by plain-clothes officers in a drugs swoop. Afterwards, Mr McKinnon was called to the town of Coatbridge to collect the van.  As he drove it  back to Rutherglen, near Glasgow, he noticed a strong smell of cannabis, but had no suspicion of what was in the back. The father-of-two said: 'They gave me the keys in a sealed blue bag, walked me out to the van, opened the gates and away I went.

Mr McKinnon said: 'When they turned up, they were asking me how it had happened  - they were dumbfounded. But there was no word of an apology or even a thank you for letting them know. 'I’m angry that they allowed me to drive it away like that.' A police spokeswoman said: 'We can confirm that we are investigating a report that a vehicle hired by Police Scotland has been returned allegedly with what is believed to be police productions inside.

Private detectives were paid £3,600 by a school to spy on a suspended English teacher who had taught there for 28 years. English teacher Kim Shaw, 56, was followed by a professional private surveillance team for three days after she went on stress-related sick leave, an employment tribunal heard today. Mrs Shaw, who taught English at Pontllanfraith Comprehensive School, near Caerphilly, South Wales, was suspended after allegations about ‘irregularities’ in her GCSE student coursework.

Mrs Shaw went on sick leave for stress-related conditions following her suspension. She was then spied on by Caerphilly Council officials, who paid the private security team. Mrs Shaw said: ‘They said I couldn’t have been stressed because I was wearing shoes with flowers on them. ‘They photographed me out shopping with my husband.

When exterminators were called to the home of a 98-year-old woman in Florida they were told she had rats in her attic. But when they investigated they found both rats and squirrels feasting on the honey made by a colony of 30,000 bees. Incredibly Sevia Moore said she had no idea the huge nest was up there and said the buzzing insects 'didn't bother her'. Exterminators called to grandmother Sevia Moore's Florida home found a colony of 30,000 bees in her attic along with rats and squirrels which she had failed to notice (file picture) Speaking to NBC News near her Cocoa Beach home, the grandmother added: 'When I'm in my garden, I don't even see them.' Expressing her shock at the discovery, Moore's granddaughter Laura Blevins commented: 'Sleeping under that - oh Lord.' Leo Cross, the founder of Florida Wildlife Trappers, who Ms Moore called, estimated that the colony had been there for about a year. Average colony sizes range between 20,000 and 100,000 insects, but are at a low point during the autumn and winter months, meaning there could have been many thousands more just a few months earlier. Cross and a colleague had to use a vacuum to clear away thousands of the stinging insects before they could lay traps to catch scores of rodents which had been eating the hive. The pest controllers had to vacuum up thousands of the insects before they could lay traps for the rats, and say that they will probably have to return to lay more (file picture) Cross said : 'The rats and squirrels were probably up there having a good time with the honeycombs. 'It's pretty mind-boggling not to notice that you have a beehive of that size upstairs.' As bees are vital to the environment and the population is in decline, the hive will not be destroyed, but moved to another area instead. Cross expects to pay more visits to Moore's house in coming days, as he and his associate expect there are ""a couple dozen"" more rats and squirrels cavorting in the attic. 'Rats reproduce every few days, so this job is ongoing,' he said. Wasps and bees will nest wherever they can find shelter and warmth, making attic spaces particularly attractive to them, especially if they are not used often. The insects can crawl through the smallest of holes before they begin to build their nests using their sharp mandibles to chew away wood beams or plasterboard which they then use as a building material. A common sign that there is an infestation is a golf-ball sized hole, often found just underneath guttering which will act as an entrance to a hive, or a crackling sound coming from a wall or ceiling. Contrary to popular belief hives will not 'buzz' unless disturbed, as the bees inside will be crawling, rather than flying. If a nest is discovered then people are advised not to tackle it themselves, as stings can be very painful and even lead to death in very high numbers. Instead call the local authorities who can arrange for the hive to be taken away, or a local beekeeper who can rehouse the colony. It is important that the nests aren't destroyed as roughly one third of commercial honeybee hives died off in the US last winter alone, meaning there are barely enough to pollinate crops. Bees are though to add roughly $10billion to the economy every year.","Sevia Moore called exterminators to her Florida home .

The judgement of an influential California politician is being called into question after it has been revealed he took a boyfriend under a fraud investigation on trips to meet foreign dignitaries and even accepted a donation from him. John Perez, 44, speaker of the California Assembly, dated Hollywood funeral director Tyler Cassity between 2011 and 2012. During that time he was aware of a $600million fraud investigation into Mr Cassity’s family’s companies, according to the San Diego Union Tribune. Mr Cassity accompanied his high-profile boyfriend on trips to meet British royalty, the Israeli president and other officials. The speaker also accepted a $1,000 donation from Mr Cassity, despite knowing it might have come from ill-gotten funds. Questionable ethics: John Perez, Speaker of the California State Assembly, was in a relationship with a man accused of taking part in a massive fraud scheme . The politician even convinced state bigwigs to donate to Cassity-favored AIDS/LifeCycle, the paper noted. All this, despite a lawsuit filed in 2009 claiming the Cassity family pillaged trust funds and insurance policies of hundreds of millions of dollars. The scam may be the largest in U.S. funeral industry history, an industry analyst told the paper.Filed in St Louis, Missouri, the suit accuses National Prearranged Services Inc collapsed as a result of the family’s pilfering, as detailed by the paper. In 2010, both Mr Cassity’s father and brother pleaded guilty to felony charges related to the scam, but he was not charged despite the lawsuit insisting he was guilty of racketeering and fraud. Hollywood Forever and Fernwood cemetery, both run by Mr Cassity, 43, are accused in the lawsuit of being run with stolen money. Accused fraudster: Tyler Cassity is accused of being part of a $600million fraud scheme . Despite becoming aware of the lawsuit and fraud investigation after beginning their relationship, Mr Lopez did not ask for details, a spokesperson told the paper, adding that the Speaker decided to let it play out in courts. The suit also alleges over $1million was embezzled to pay off Mr Cassity’s personal credit card bills.Mr Cassity has fought the lawsuit, but has not responded to any interview requests from the paper. His lawyer also declined to comment. In light of these revelations, Kirk Hanson, executive director of the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University, told the Union Times that Mr Pérez displayed ‘colossal bad judgment’ for continuing the relationship. The ethics expert cited the $1,000 political donation accepted from Mr Cassity by Mr Lopez, and the alleged fraudster’s inclusion among dignitaries, as further proof of his questionable judgement displayed by the politician. Hollywood Forever: The extravagant Holly cemetery owned by Tyler Cassity is at the center of a massive fraud scandal . Legendary: 'Gone with the Wind's Hattie McDaniel and Looney Tunes voice legend Mel Blanc are among the Hollywood icons buried at Hollywood Forever . The duo were seen at events including Prince William and wife Kate Middleton and a trip to Israel where they met Israeli President Shimon Peres and other officials, according to the Union Tribune. Mr Lopez isn’t the only politician to have received donations from the accused thief. Through a SuperPAC he set up, Mr Cassity has donated about $38,000 to Democratic candidates and causes, records cited by the paper show. Additionally, of the $53,000 in donations raised by Mr Cassity, for AIDS/LifeCycle, more than $33,000 came from lawmakers, lobbyists and Sacramento political contributors with ties to the speaker,’ the paper reported. Donors included ‘lobbyists, including two former Assembly speakers, Fabian Núñez and Robert Hertzberg,’ according to the paper. Another ‘seven have worked for either Pérez’s legislative office or his political operation,’ the paper further revealed.

Land Rover wanted to come up with a gruelling way of testing out its new eco-friendly prototype, so set drivers the challenge of completing the epic trip from Solihull in the Midlands to Mumbai. The trail saw the cars traversing 13 countries along the way, encountering miles of mud and gravel tracks on the route which was designed to connect Asia to Europe for trading over 2,000 years ago. The new Range Rover Hybrid prototypes take on the 10,500-mile journey from England to India, travelling through 13 different countries along the way .

The first attempt at the drive from London to Cape Town was undertaken 80 years ago in 1933 in a Morris Eight convertible driven by Britons Cameron Gilg and Walter Kay. The pair took a whopping 158 days to navigate a 13,000-mile route, which started in Liverpool and included a treacherous Sahara crossing. Subsequent attempts at setting new records have been achieved on the 30th, 50th and 80th anniversaries of that first run.

Fans held signs that read 'Stay Strong 28' and 'Prayers for Adrian,' and several teammates offered hugs and well wishes before the game. 'I just prayed and asked God to give me the strength just to get through the game, just play and focus,' Peterson said. 'And for the most part, I did.' He took the field for Sunday’s match up against the Carolina Panthers to a roar from fans who had showed up early just to greet him.

A serial killer convicted of murdering three teenagers in 1996 confessed to police he had also killed a 14-year-old boy 23 years ago after the two 'performed a sex act', a court heard today. Steven Grieveson, 42, admitted to police in an interview last year that he killed schoolboy Simon Martin in 1990, a jury at Newcastle Crown Court was told. He also told police the crime had 'haunted' him for years. Grieveson denies murdering the schoolboy at a derelict house in Sunderland and is claiming diminished responsibility for his actions.

The man was . convicted in 1996 of murdering Thomas Kelly, 18, David Hanson and David . Grieff, both 15. They had been strangled and their bodies burned. The jury were told that in January last year Grieveson confessed in a police interview that he had gone to Gilside House, Roker, with Simon after they played football together in May 1990. Then 19-and-a-half, Grieveson said he and the 14-year-old 'performed a sex act'. In the interview, he said: 'After I was finished I got scared, I started shouting at him not to tell anyone. 'I just flipped for a minute and I started strangling him. I didn’t let go and the next thing, he was on the bed. 'I think there was a rock or something and I smashed his head in.'

William Lowe QC, prosecuting, told the jury Grieveson took the boy’s trousers and bottoms, throwing his footwear into the sea and binning the clothes.the court heard. The court heard how Grieveson told police why he was confessing to killing the teenager. He said: 'I needed to tell police, it has haunted us for 20 years. 'I have self-harmed because of it. It has driven me crazy and I need to give the family peace of mind, myself as well. I cannot move forward unless this is said.' Mr Lowe, prosecuting, added: 'For whatever reason he strangled with his bare hands and with a ligature this 14-year-old boy and then smashed his skull. 'We said he did that with an intention to kill and that he is guilty of murder.' The prosecution claimed the violence Grieveson used on Simon, and then on his three later victims, may have been to keep them quiet after sex, or to force them into engaging in homosexual acts. On the evening of May 18, 1990 when he was murdered, Simon had been playing with friends at a local park and his mother Jean had asked him to be home for 6pm in time for his tea, Mr Lowe said. The police were called at 8pm when he had not returned, and his father, a former soldier, and older brother went out looking for him. His body was found on May 26 by two boys who were playing in the derelict house. The body of Simon Martin was found at Gillside House, Sunderland, pictured. It has since been demolished . Haunted: Grieveson told police he felt compelled to confess to his involvement in Simon Martin's death because he felt 'haunted' by it . Simon, who was 5ft2 and around eight stone, was naked from the waist down and lying on a mattress. Blood was splattered on the walls and he had suffered a serious head injury. Semen linked to Grieveson by DNA testing in 2000 was found on the boy’s body. Bruising to his neck was also discovered, indicating he had been strangled. Grieveson, who worked at a local fairground, had been seen walking from the park with his victim. Three days after the body was discovered, the killer told police they had walked to a newsagents, and when he went inside the shop, Simon waited outside. By the time Grieveson left, his friend had disappeared, he claimed. In his confession 22 years later, . Grieveson told police he was a glue-sniffer and afraid of people finding . out he was bisexual, Mr Lowe said. The . jury was told the defence will put forward expert witnesses who will . give evidence to say the defendant 'by reason of an abnormality of mind' was unable to exercise self-control, Mr Lowe said. 'The prosecution do not accept that for one minute,' the barrister said. He added: 'Steven Grieveson had the ability to choose whether to kill him or let him go. 'He chose to kill him and he is guilty of murder and nothing less.' Grieveson, was convicted of killing David Hanson, 15, David Grieff, 15, and Thomas Kelly, 18 in 1996.

A Florida high school crowned the state’s first-ever homecoming king and queen with Down syndrome Friday night. Travjuan ‘Bubba’ Hunter and Semone Adkins, both seniors, were crowned in an emotional Friday night ceremony on the football field just before West Orange High’s game against rival Cyprus Creek. Fueled by the positive energy from the uplifting ceremony, West Orange won the game 56-7. Royalty: Travjuan ¿Bubba¿ Hunter and Semone Adkins were named West Orange High School homecoming king and queen in an on-field ceremony last week . Up against traditional favorites such as football players and cheerleaders, the couple faced what many would consider long odds to take center stage. But they won, and were celebrated in grand style. Shown in local media footage riding to the field in the tops of open convertibles, the two students were treated like royalty and cheered on by many, according to the Orlando Sentinel. ‘We love you, Bubba!’ A group of girls screeched as he waved to the crowd during the homecoming parade. ‘Semone, you look beautiful!!’ Many people shouted as she waved on. Big man on campus: 'Bubba,' as students affectionately call him, waves to the adoring masses . Arriving in style: Ms Adkins also waves to the crowd as they cheer her on . Cheers came from friends, family, cheerleaders, the girls lacrosse team, other students, town residents and even police officers, according to the paper. This dream came true only because of the inclusive spirit of West Orange High School. ‘This didn't happen because we feel sorry for them or something,’ senior quarterback Hayden Griffits, 18, told the Sentinel. ‘Just the opposite, they really deserve it. I mean, homecoming is about bringing people together and having fun. And that's what they do.’ Bubba, as he is playfully called by classmates, is a popular in West Orange. He has many friends and spends most of his lunch period arm wrestling all challengers, including athletes and teachers – he usually wins, according to ClickOrlando. ‘Everybody in town knows Bubba, teacher’s aide Michelle Cavanzon told the Sentinel. ‘I swear he could run for mayor — and probably win.

Walking out on stage to Beyonce’s ‘Single Ladies,’ ‘he sometimes-shy, sweet young thing transformed into a strutting diva who extended her hand with all the attitude the song demanded,’ said the Sentinel. The pinnacle of the performance came when Mr Hunter confidently walked out on stage, dropped to one knee and ‘put a ring on it.’ The auditorium went wild. Overcome with emotion, his mother burst into tears. ‘I cried the whole time,’ Janice Morgan, Mr Hunter's mom, told the Sentinel ‘I was so proud of him.’for over a decade, the would-be king and queen ended up on the ballot after a group of students wrote them in to the ballot. Their fantasy became reality Friday night. Then, in an almost too god to be true turn of events, West Orange decimated their rivals and sent the whole town into a frenzy. ‘It was a dream come true, because I always knew that she was going to be something great in this world and this is just the beginning for us,’ Karen McNeil, Ms Adkins' mother, told ClickOrlando.","West Orange High School Seniors Travjuan ‘Bubba’ Hunter and Semone Adkins have been friends for over a decade .

Squeeze: Social Security recipients face historic low increases as Government struggles to balance its books . Millions of Americans are facing the second year of near record low social security rises. More than one-fifth of the country are bracing themselves for a 1.5 per cent increase - one of the smallest since 1975, according to an analysis by The Associated Press. Since then, when annual rises, called the cost-of-living-adjustment (COLA), were introduced, Social Security increases have averaged 4.1 per cent. Nearly 58 million, including disabled veterans, retirees, handicapped workers, spouses and children, will be affected by the historic lows. The average monthly payment is $1,162. A 1.5 per cent raise would increase the typical monthly payment by about $17. The COLA also affects benefits for more than three million disabled . veterans, about two and a half million federal retirees and their . survivors, and more than eight million people who get Supplemental . Security Income, the disability program for the poor. The exact COLA report will not be known until the Labor Department releases the inflation report for September which has been delayed due to the partial government shutdown. Automatic . COLAs were adopted so that benefits for people on fixed incomes would . keep up with rising prices. Lower prices for gasoline is one of the factors helping to contribute to holding down inflation, according to experts. But some experts fear the measure used . to calculate Social Security payments is not keeping pace with the rise . in the cost of living. David Waugh of Bethesda, Md., told The Associated Press he . can handle one small COLA but several in a row make it hard to plan for . unexpected expenses. 'I'm not one of those folks that's going to fall into poverty, but it is going to make a difference in my standard of living as time goes by,' said Waugh, 83, who retired from the United Nations. 'I live in a small apartment and I have an old car, and it's going to break down. And no doubt when it does, I'll have to fix it or get a new one.' Only six times have they been less than two percent, including this year, when the increase was 1.7 percent. There was no COLA in 2010 or 2011 because inflation was too low. By law, the cost-of-living adjustment . is based on the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical . Workers, or CPI-W, a broad measure of consumer prices generated by the . Bureau of Labor Statistics. It measures price changes for food, housing, . clothing, transportation, energy, medical care, recreation and . education. The COLA is . calculated by comparing consumer prices in July, August and September . each year to prices in the same three months from the previous year. If . prices go up over the course of the year, benefits go up, starting with . payments delivered in January. Cost of living: Experts fear Social Security payments are not keeping pace with the rising cost of living, such as food prices (File photo) This year, average prices for July and August were 1.4 percent higher than they were a year ago, according to the CPI-W. Once the September report, the final piece of the puzzle, is released, the COLA can be announced officially. If prices continued to slowly inch up in September, that would put the COLA at roughly 1.5 percent. Several economists said there were no dramatic price swings in September to significantly increase or decrease the projected COLA. That means the projection should not change by more than a few tenths of a percentage point, if at all. Polina Vlasenko, a research fellow at the American Institute for Economic Research, projects the COLA will be between 1.4 percent and 1.6 percent. The exact COLA figure has been delayed due to the partial shutdown of Federal Government . Her projection is similar to those done by others, including AARP, which estimates the COLA will be between 1.5 percent and 1.7 percent. The Senior Citizens League estimates it will be about 1.5 percent. Lower prices for gasoline are helping to fuel low inflation, Vlasenko said. 'In years with high COLA's, a lot of . that had to do with fuel prices and in some cases food prices. Neither . of those increased much this year,' Vlasenko said. 'So that kept the lid . on the overall increase in prices.' Gasoline . prices are down 2.4 percent from a year ago while food prices are up . slightly, according to the August inflation report. Housing costs went . up 2.3 percent and utilities increased by 3.2 percent. Advocates . for seniors say the government's measure of inflation doesn't . accurately reflect price increases older Americans face because they . tend to spend more of their income on health care. Medical costs went up . less than in previous years but still outpaced other consumer prices, . rising 2.5 percent. 'This (COLA) is not enough to keep up with inflation, as it affects seniors,' said Max Richtman, who heads the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. 'There are some things that become cheaper but they are not things that seniors buy. Laptop computers have gone down dramatically but how many people at 70 are buying laptop computers?' The cost of personal computers dropped by 10.6 percent over the past year, according the CPI-W. That's a small consolation to Alberta Gaskins of the District of Columbia, who said she is concerned about keeping up with her household bills. 'It is very important to get the COLA because everything else you have in your life is on an upward swing, and if you're on a downward swing, that means your quality of life is going down,' said Gaskins, who retired from the Postal Service in 1989.","58 million Americans on Social Security are set for 1.5% increase .

A Libyan who has been held and interrogated for a week aboard a U.S. warship is now in New York awaiting trial on terrorism charges, U.S. officials said Monday. The al-Qaida suspect, known as Abu Anas al-Libi, has been under federal indictment in New York for more than a decade. He's due to stand trial over whether he helped plan and conduct surveillance for the bombings of U.S. embassies in Africa in 1998. Two U.S. officials said he arrived in New York on Saturday and has been held while he awaits an arraignment in federal court. Al-Libi would be the latest in a string of defendants to face civilian trials under President Barack Obama. Early in his term, he faced criticism for planning to prosecute admitted 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in New York. Since then, however, the city has hosted the trial of Ahmed Ghailani, who received a life sentence on a terrorism charge in 2011. Al-Libi, whose full name is Nazih Abdul-Hamed al-Ruqai, could be in court as early as Tuesday, officials said. But there were no new public court filings in his case. The officials insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter. Al-Libi used to be on the FBI's list of most wanted terrorists. His family says he was not in al-Qaida.

Jailed: Jack Craig Gray, from Shildon, County Durham, has been sentenced to seven years in prison after carrying out the brutal 'contract kicking' A baby-faced teenager has been jailed for seven years after carrying out a brutal 'contract kicking' on a blind man over an alleged debt of just £80. Jack Craig Gray, 18, was 'put up' to the beating by older companions, who promised to pay him £150, a court heard. He attacked the vulnerable man in an alleyway - repeatedly punching and kicking him until he lost consciousness. The 30-year-old victim, who is registered blind, was forced to undergo protracted facial surgery and is still receiving hospital treatment four months after the attack in Shildon, County Durham. Gray and his unnamed victim, who did not know each other, had been at a mutual friend’s house on June 3, Durham Crown Court heard. Christine Egerton, prosecuting, said the man had left the house after fearing he would be attacked over a debt of £80. However, he was followed and cornered in an alleyway by Gray, who was joined by a second person. 'The defendant put his hands on his chest and mentioned the £80 he owed, before punching him around four times about the face with a clenched fist,' she said. 'He fell forwards bleeding and was then repeatedly kicked, although the other person present may have also been involved.' The victim, who later regained consciousness, managed to walk home and call an ambulance. He suffered several fractures to his facial and nasal bones, as well numerous swellings and bruises. Miss Egerton said: 'He was already registered blind due to poor vision in both eyes, but it was feared he may not recover sight in his right eye which is now much worse, although it is hoped his nose can be rebuilt. Sentence: The 18-year-old, who admitted grievous bodily harm with intent at a previous hearing, was also ordered to pay a statutory surcharge of £150 at Durham Crown Court (pictured) 'He has now moved back in with his mother and is fearful being out on his own. 'He spoke of having done nothing at all to encourage this and was at a loss as to why the person attacked him.' Gray, from Shildon, initially denied responsibility, but was picked him out at a video identity parade. The other assailant has not been identified. John Turner, defending, said: 'Gray tells me he was directed by someone a lot older and more sophisticated to go and speak to this man about the debt. 'He accepted throwing three to four punches and a kick when he went to ground, but he then moved away and the other man may have then continued the assault. 'My client is almost being cast as an enforcer for a local gang. He denies that. 'He says he did this with the expectation he would receive payment. A figure of £150 was mentioned, but, as it happens, he received nothing.' Sentencing Gray to seven years' detention in a young offenders’ institution, Recorder Ben Nolan said: 'This might be described as a ""contract kicking"" to enforce a debt. 'It matters not that others, older, may have been behind this. 'The fact is you took part in what was a serious plan to enforce this debt by violence, with grave consequences for the victim.' Gray, who admitted grievous bodily harm with intent at a previous hearing, was ordered to pay a statutory surcharge of £150.","Jack Craig Gray, from Shildon, County Durham, was 'put up' to the beating by older companions, a court heard .

It was part of four simultaneous arrests of men who police believe may have been plotting a Kenya attack . At the same time as the Westbourne Grove seige, armed police fired special ammunition - designed to breach doors or burst tyres - to stop a car on Mansell Street, near the Tower of London. They also arrested two men, both aged 25. One is a British national of Turkish origin, while the other is a British national of Algerian origin. A 29-year-old, a British national of Pakistani origin, was also held in Peckham Street, south-east London, during last night’s MI5-assisted operation.

According to the paper, an attack by several gunmen in the capital is the worst fear of anti-terror bosses. And as six addresses across the capital continue to be searched by the Metropolitan Police, further eyewitness reports have emerged. City of London councillor John Fletcher, whose apartment backs on to Mansell Street, said he heard two loud bangs which he initially thought were fireworks. He said it was not until his wife told him about the commotion on the street and he went to investigate that he realised the seriousness of the situation.

Operation: A restaurant worker said a man arrested in west London was swooped on by specialist officers in several cars who pushed him up against the glass of the restaurant . Mr Fletcher said he then realised the two loud bangs were related to the arrest, but could not say for sure what they were. The councillor said he was left without answers when he tried to question a policeman about the situation. 'He said ""You'll hear all about it in the papers tomorrow"",' he said. 'I asked him if there was any danger to the residents in the flats I represent and he said there's no danger to them at all.' Neighbour Catherine Delgado, 43, saw the incident and said about 'five or six' cars swarmed over one vehicle, blocking off the street in the process. Arrests: Police arrested two men at Mansell Street in Whitechapel, east London . Ms Delgado said police, some in special uniforms, began shouting at the driver to get out of the vehicle, but he was refusing. She also recalled hearing two loud bangs, but was unable to say whether shots were fired. The concerned resident said she tried to get information from police about the incident, but was also denied. 'They didn't say anything,' she said. 'There were two policemen on top of a guy, . pinning him down and from what I may have heard, the assailant said in . maybe a foreign accent ""please don't break my arm""' - Neighbour George Paul . 'I asked the policewoman what was going on and she said ""We can't tell you anything, just go away, just go away"". 'But I said ""I'm quite worried because I'm living here, someone tells me there's a terrorist with a bomb"". '""Is this true? Because (if it is), I'm going"".' Mr Fletcher said his ward of Portsoken was generally incident-free and he suspected police chose Mansell Street to intercept the suspects because it was a wide, busy road. Ramin Massodi described the suspect arrested in the upmarket Westbourne Grove raid as 'handsome'. Mr Massodi, who witnessed the drama unfold from inside the Persian restaurant where he works, added: 'He definitely didn't look like a terrorist at all.' He said police came into the restaurant and apprehended another man, but later released him without charge. The restaurant worker said the arrested . man had been swooped on by specialist officers in several cars who . pushed him up against the glass of the restaurant. Held: A final man was arrested on Peckham Street in east London. All four are being held by police. 'I heard shouting then I looked outside and saw four cars... and they grabbed him,' he said. Neighbour George Paul, who lived across the street from the restaurant, said he was sitting in his flat when he head the commotion outside. 'I poked my head out the window - it was dark - but I could clearly see at least three cars,' he said. 'They were stopping traffic in all directions. There were two policemen on top of a guy, pinning him down and from what I may have heard, the assailant said in maybe a foreign accent ""please don't break my arm"".' Mr Paul said officers then handcuffed the man and pressed him against the restaurant wall. Wreckage: The collapsed upper car park of the Westgate Mall in Nairobi, following last month's terrorist attack . He said he thought about coming out to investigate further but decided against it because of how serious the situation seemed. Mr Paul, who has lived in the area for 30 years, said he had never seen anything like it before. 'This is one of the best policed areas, there's two policemen walking around every 15 minutes,' he said. 'It's a very safe area so this is a surprise, it's a shock basically.' The street where the man was arrested in Notting Hill is lined with restaurants and boutiques. A restaurant owner, who did not want to be named, said the incident closed down most of the street and cost him a significant amount of business.

Scientists have come up with a way of adding texture to touch screen computers so users can feel what they see. Researchers have written an algorithm for 2D touchscreens that modifies the friction between a user's finger and the screen to add physical sensations to what a viewer is looking at. The discovery could lead to textured maps where users can feel tall mountains, new apps for visually impaired people and more interactive touchscreen games. Scroll down for video . Researchers have written an algorithm for 2D touchscreens that modify the friction between a user's finger and the screen to add physical sensations to what a viewer is looking at. Disney Research said the technology can be sued to feel features in a video (pictured) One key feature of the algorithm is that it is light weight and can be implemented in real-time. A 3D model of objects (like the kettle seen here) can be zoomed and panned in real-time to sense fine edge and protruding features of the object . Scientists at Disney Research had previously managed to add physical sensations to virtual interactions like Microsoft Kinect by using puffs of air to give a user the sensations that they are touching what they are seeing on screen. But they have now applied their idea to touchscreens in a new way, Tested reported. The algorithm, for 'the tactile rendering of 3D features' on a 2D touchscreen, modifies the friction by producing subtle vibrations based on the slope of a virtual surface. For example, if there is a dome on the screen, increased friction could make it feel like a user is passing their finger over a bump. The algorithm modifies the friction between a person's finger and the screen, based on the slope of a virtual surface. For example, if there is a dome on the screen, increased friction could make it feel like a user is passing their finger over a bump . Disney Research claims that it can reproduce edges, ridges, protrusions and bumps as well as other sensations using its technology, which creates the ability for people to feel the geography of maps, including raised mountains (pictured) The algorithm does this by modifying the voltage of the display to vary its friction so that different textures will affect the sensations a user feels in their fingertips. Disney Research claims that it can reproduce edges, ridges, protrusions and bumps as well as other sensations using its technology. The company said: 'A person sliding a finger across a . topographic map displayed on a touch screen can feel the bumps and . curves of hills and valleys, despite the screen’s smooth surface, with . the aid of a novel algorithm. The method can be used to simulate the feel of a wide variety of objects and textures. Disney Research said the algorithm is based on a discovery that when a person slides a finger over a real physical bump, they perceive the bump largely because lateral friction forces stretch and compress skin on the sliding finger. Users touching this image with the technology would feel bumps - the surface of the apples . Disney Research said: 'The algorithm is based on a discovery . that when a person slides a finger over a real physical bump, the person . perceives the bump largely because lateral friction forces stretch and . compress skin on the sliding finger.' The algorithm is able to produce varying sensations and does not have to rely on a library of textures to apply to objects as it can produce custom textures at it goes. Ivan Poupyrev, who directs Disney Research, Pittsburgh’s Interaction Group, said: 'Our brain perceives the 3D bump on a surface mostly from information that it receives via skin stretching. 'Therefore, if we can artificially stretch . skin on a  finger as it slides on the touch screen, the brain will be . fooled into thinking an actual physical bump is on a touch screen even . though the touch surface is completely smooth.' The technology could be used in various ways in the future, including being embedded into next-generation touchscreen displays.

Council workers will be paid thousands of pounds to park their cars - even if they do not drive to work, it was revealed today. Staff will receive up to £800 each next year as compensation for moving to new offices with less parking - but the handout will be given even if workers walk, cycle or use public transport. Eastleigh Borough Council in Hampshire will pay the sums to around 400 employees, because there are only six spaces at its new town centre headquarters. Changing locations: The car park at the Eastleigh Borough Council offices in Hampshire. Staff will receive up to £800 each next year as compensation for moving to new offices with less parking . But angry tax campaigners have branded the payouts 'ridiculous'. It comes as the authority relocates from a site with free parking to a new £12million home less than two miles away. The lowest paid staff will get £800 for the next three years, falling gradually to £267 by 2021/22 - a total of £4,801. Top earners will receive £533 for the first year, dropping to nothing by 2017/18. Eleanor McGrath, of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: ‘Moving the council offices might be a slight inconvenience for staff. But it is ridiculous that this allowance is going to those that catch the bus or bike to work. ‘Most local residents who commute pay . for their own travel, so they will find it hard to swallow that their . council tax is being used in this way. ‘At a time when budgets are . tight, the council should focus on saving taxpayers' cash and delivering . frontline services, not paying for staff perks.’ Statement: The authority says its current home is in need of repair and moving to the 'more accessible' new site will be cheaper than refurbishing the old offices . Even the council's new chief executive will have to pay for parking at the new site, which only has three spaces for pool cars and three disabled bays. Moving: The new offices for Eastleigh Borough Council in Hampshire are still being built . An annual parking permit in the town costs £1,067. Today, residents reacted in anger to the announcement. Health carer Kate Omondi, 30, from Eastleigh, said other workers would find the payouts unfair. She added: ‘Any other person who works in other town centre offices has to pay to park. People who already work there will feel it's unfair they have to pay but council workers don't. Why should we pay for their parking when we have to pay ourselves?’ The council defended the  'self-funding' scheme, saying its current home is in need of repair and moving to the 'more accessible' new site will be cheaper than refurbishing the old offices. A council spokesman said: ‘This time-limited scheme recognises the transitional costs for staff in this move. The scheme will be self-funding and will not be a cost to borough residents over the life of the scheme.’ Councillors will be able to claim back parking fees on expenses. Council leader Keith House said for some workers it would be more convenient if they lived in Eastleigh or because the building was close to rail and bus links. But union chiefs said the payments showed 'contempt' for staff. Peter Terry, regional organiser for union Unison, argued staff would still face paying out more money, due to the parking permit cost. He said: ‘It is saying to continue working for us you can pay £200 for the privilege - that's disgraceful. ‘These are staff having to do more, work harder because the demand is much greater on services and there's fewer staff doing it. It shows a contempt for the employees.’ The council spokesman said they could not put an overall figure on the payments, following the relocation next spring. He added: 'The scheme would be self-funding and would likely not include staff who join after April. The report has been taken to cabinet but is still out for consultation.'","Staff will still receive handout if walking, cycling or using public transport .

Awareness: The United Nations' AIDS agency (UNAIDS) predicts there are about 780,000 people living with HIV in China . China plans to ban people with HIV from accessing spas, hot springs and public bathhouses, it has been revealed today. The Chinese government has posted a draft regulation online, ordering spas and similar premises to display signs prohibiting 'people with sexually transmitted diseases, AIDS and infectious skin diseases'. The proposal, which has been condemned by the United Nations' AIDS agency (UNAIDS), has sparked outrage among campaign groups. It is the latest instance of ongoing discrimination against HIV carriers in the world's most populous country. China already bans those with the virus from becoming civil servants - with HIV-positive people facing the possibility of losing their jobs if their employers discover their status. Others HIV carriers have sought hospital treatment, only to be turned away. Hedia Belhadj, China's coordinator for UNAIDS, said she was concerned by the proposed Ministry of Commerce rule, which was posted online by China's State Council today. She called for it to be removed - pointing out there is no risk of transmission of HIV in a spa or bathhouse setting. 'UNAIDS recommends that restrictions preventing people living with HIV from accessing bath houses, spas and other similar facilities be removed from the final draft of this policy,' she said. She also urged that 'any other policies preventing people living with HIV from accessing public or private services be revised'. Campaign groups have also spoken out against the proposal, which could affect as many as 780,000 people living with HIV in China.

'The only value of this draft law is in discriminating against those with AIDS,' said, Yu Fangqiang, director of the Nanjing-based anti-discrimination NGO Justice for All. 'This law must be changed. All the HIV NGOs know this new rule, and they want to fight it.' He added that his organisation and five other domestic NGOs are seeking to collaborate on a response. In 2010, China lifted a long-standing ban on HIV-positive foreigners entering the country - although, in recent years, top officials have spoken more openly about HIV prevention and control. The country has also extended access to free antiretroviral drugs for HIV-positive people. However, discrimination against those with HIV and AIDS remains an issue at hospitals, workplaces and other establishments across China. In January, a draft regulation in south China's Guangdong province proposed to ban people with HIV and other sexually-transmitted diseases from becoming teachers. But officials dropped the provision in April after an outcry from rights groups. Most attempts by HIV-positive people to sue over discrimination have failed. However, earlier this year, a plaintiff who was denied a teaching job after it was revealed he was HIV-positive was awarded 45,000 yuan (£4,605) from an east China county education bureau, state media reported. The case marked a milestone that activists have cited as a cause for hope in future legal battles. Ms Belhadj said that widespread stigmatisation of those with HIV in China has complicated efforts to curb its spread. Addressing the 'stigmatisation and discrimination against people living with HIV essential in the national response,' she added.","The Chinese government plans to ban people with HIV from accessing spas, hot springs and public bathhouses, it was revealed today .

'Virtually every cake I make starts with basic slab cakes, stacked and carved into shape, I use no shaped tins or moulds.' 'People can't believe my work is a cake when they first see it, and the reaction is universally ""that's a cake!?""'

A critically ill grandmother died after being plunged into the icy North Sea wearing just her night gown in a bungled cruise ship rescue operation. An inquest heard yesterday how Janet Richardson, 72, fell into the water as crew members tried to transfer her to a lifeboat on a stretcher. Passengers shrieked in horror as the pensioner suffered ‘near drowning’ as she fought to stay afloat for up to eight minutes without a life jacket. Janet Richardson, pictured with her husband George, had been airlifted to Cumberland Hospital in Carlisle after falling into the subzero waters off the coast of Norway . She was eventually pulled to safety using a long pole - but she died in hospital three weeks later, the hearing was told. Yesterday, a pathologist said her immersion in the 2C water was a ‘significant contributory factor’ in her death. Mrs Richardson had been on a cruise with her husband George, 80, to see the Northern Lights when she collapsed in her cabin with a gastro-intestinal haemorrhage in in March 2011. The liner, the Ocean Countess, was at the time just off the coast of Norway and the captain decided she needed hospital treatment immediately. Crew members strapped her to a stretcher with a blanket and tried to pass her to a team on a lifeboat which had pulled up beside the liner. But a witness told yesterday how the two boats were not tethered together even though they were travelling side-by-side at 10 knots. The boats began to move apart at the crucial moment - plunging the stretcher and Mrs Richardson into the sea. As terrified passengers looked on from the deck, one woman was so shocked that she fainted. Eye . witness Colin Prescott said: ‘The bow wave from the cruise ship . separated it from the rescue ship. As the stretcher got extended, the . crew on the rescue boat let go. ‘The ones on the cruise ship could not bring it back. The stretcher was forced out of their hands and slid into the sea. ‘I . saw the stretcher hit the side of the vessel. They tried to hold onto . it, but it slid down vertically like a hinge and the blanket came off. ‘Mrs . Richardson went one way and the stretcher went the other. She just . floated off. There was abject panic on the cruise ship - that is the . only way I can describe it. Voices were raised, almost shrieking. The grandmother was plunged into the sea as cruise workers tried to transfer her to a lifeboat on a stretcher, an inquest heard . It is thought the boats moved apart at a crucial moment while the pensioner was being moved. Mrs Richardson died three weeks after being airlifted to hospital . ‘Her arm went out as if she was trying to swim.’ Mrs Richardson was treated in Norway and underwent brain and heart scans before being airlifted back to the UK. Mr Richardson kept a vigil by her bedside in Cumberland Hospital in Carlisle hospital until her death on April 21. Mrs Richardson, of Ousby, near Penrith, suffered from cirrhosis of the liver, raised blood pressure and was an insulin-dependent diabetic. Prior to the cruise, she had been hospitalised with pneumonia and was due for further medical treatment on her return. The inquest heard that she was 18st and had a history of ill-health but that fighting for her life in freezing temperatures may have contributed to her death. Home Office pathologist Dr Alison Armour said: ‘She suffered near-drowning. Her head was underwater for between two and four minutes and in that time her body temperature reduced to 32C, as opposed to the normal temperature of 37C. ‘Although the eventual cause of death was from natural disease, this episode would have has a serious impact on her condition.’ Mr and Mrs Richardson, who had both been married before, had children from previous relationships and together have a total of eight grandchildren. The hearing continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Janet Richardson was being transferred to a lifeboat on a stretcher when she fell into the freezing water .

Killer and rapist: Marvin Samuels who has been jailed for life with a minimum of 33 years after he murdered his on-off girlfriend hours after brutally raping a stranger . A man convicted of murdering his on-off girlfriend hours after brutally raping a stranger has been jailed for life with a minimum of 33 years for the 'horrifying' attacks. Marvin Samuels, 31, stabbed Sharlana Diedrick, 32, 16 times and would have continued the frenzied attack if he had not hurt his hand. Hours earlier he attacked a 43-year-old woman as . she walked her chihuahua around a reservoir in Brent, north London, because she looked like Ms Diedrick. The victim was dragged into the undergrowth before being ordered to strip naked and was then raped. The Old Bailey heard he tried to strangle her with her scarf, before repeatedly . beating her over the head with a bottle and tree branch. He then left her . for dead. He was found unanimously guilty of murder at the Old Bailey last week and had admitted two other charges of rape and grievous bodily harm. Sentencing Samuels today, Judge Timothy Pontius told him: 'These three crimes are all individually horrifying in the extent of the mere brutality with which they were committed. Taken together, they represent a level of violent behaviour carried out during a period of just a few hours that I have rarely encountered. 'You went out armed with at least one knife that day and by the time you murdered Sharlana Diedrick you had two knives.' The judge said it was noted that he did not use a knife on his rape victim. 'Nevertheless, you raped her brutally and beat her savagely with a tree branch and, on your own admission, a bottle,' he said. 'Furthermore, you used a scarf to strangle her.' Victim: Sharlana Diedrick was stabbed 16 times and Samuels would have continued the frenzied attack if he had not hurt his hand . The woman 'remains so traumatised by the extent she suffered at your hands that she has been unable to describe any of it', the judge added. 'It was only six hours or so later that you killed Sharlana Diedrick, the mother of your young son.' Powerfully-built Samuels, of Stonebridge, north west London, showed no emotion as he was told he would serve three concurrent life sentences for the three counts. He denied murder, claiming he was not 'mentally responsible' at the time. Crime scene: The 43-year-old woman was attacked as she walked her chihuahua around Welsh Harp reservoir - also known as the Brent reservoir - in north-west London . The judge went on: 'In all the evidence the jury and I have heard, in particular the number of blows and the force with which they were inflicted on a wholly defenceless woman sitting at the wheel of her car, I am not of the slightest doubt that you intended to kill her. Terrible crimes: Hours before Sharlana Diedrick was murdered, Samuels brutally raped a woman because she looked like her . 'Furthermore, whatever your mental state at present, there is no doubt in my mind that on September 29 last year your mind was not so afflicted as to lessen the culpability of what you did to any extent.' Jurors heard he launched the terrifying attack on a 42-year-old woman who was walking her pet chihuahua by Welsh Harp Reservoir in Neasden, north west London, at around 5pm. He battered the woman, who looked like Ms Diedrick, with a bottle and a piece of wood after dragging her into undergrowth. He strangled her with her scarf, rendering her unconscious, and then left her for dead. The victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was unable to give information about what happened to her but forensic evidence was found linking Samuels to her. Her naked and badly-beaten body was found when her worried husband and others carried out a search after she did not return home. Ms Diedrick, with whom Samuels had a 'volatile' relationship, was found at 11.16pm that night with her body slumped halfway out of her Hyundai car, which was parked near his home. Witnesses said they had heard her screaming. She suffered 16 stab wounds to the chest and abdomen. Samuels, who the court heard has suffered from an anti-social personality disorder and paranoia since childhood, was also charged with the attempted murder of the rape victim but was cleared by jurors.","Marvin .

A brainchild of London-based photographer Tom Lakeman,28, and Tom Webber,29, an advertising and marketing executive, the exhibition came about from watching a friend's dog nose its feeding bowl around the kitchen. Mr Webber explained: 'We've seen art by elephants, horses and chimpanzees with a paintbrush attached to their noses, but we thought what about a dog? 'The dogs are given a bowl full of food that's sat on a piece of blank paper. Underneath the bowl is an oil pastel which leaves a trail as the dog pushes the bowl around with its nose.

The pieces are available for purchase, with a framed original costing £100 and all the proceeds go to Battersea Dogs and Cats Home. Mr Webber said: 'This is the first time we have made it public. We have tried it out with our own dogs and friends' dogs a few times, and have always wanted to do something like an exhibition with the home. 'We approached them a little while ago at a reunion and eventually we organised the exhibition. 'We are amazed at how well it went. So many people turned out and many brought their own dogs along too. Proud pooch: One of the exhibition's artists admires the canine creations on display . Showcase: When the piece is finished it is framed and hung on the gallery wall along with a portrait of the doggy artist .

Paws for thought: The exhibition, held just a short distance from the rescue centre in Battersea, will run until October 20, and anyone attending can take their own dog along to try their paw at painting . 'Jeremy Hackett, the owner of the clothing company, happened to be in the area eating at a restaurant. 'He stopped by with his own dog after seeing all the people and dogs in the gallery and they made a piece of their own.

Steve Jobs’ dreams of a futuristic new Cupertino Apple headquarters have come one step closer to being realized as execs recently unveiled a giant mock-up their founder’s dream campus. Nicknamed the Apple spaceship, the building shares the same innovative design as the company’s groundbreaking products thanks to a little help from the same creative minds that brought the world the iPhone and iPad. The ring-shaped structure, which encloses a tree-filled arboretum, was Jobs’ brainchild. After his death, Apple design guru Jony Ive took over with the help of famed architect Sir Norman Foster. Inspired: A room-sized mock-up of the planned new Apple headquarters in Cupertino, California shows the company's innovation extends beyond its products and into real estate . On Tuesday, executives will ask Cupertino, California’s city council to approve their ambitious plans. ‘You see the energy and the love and the attention to detail that we've put into this,’ said Apple CFO Peter Oppenheimer at an unveiling of the top secret spaceship plans. ‘We have treated this project just as we would any Apple product. And this will be a place for the most creative and collaborative teams in the industry to innovate for decades to come.’ The circular, four story building will be around a mile in circumference and a third of a mile wide. Described by the San Fransisco Weekly as a ‘massive glass doughnut’, it will have a big courtyard in the center and use natural gas as the primary power source. Open: CFO Peter Oppenheimer, left, and Senior Director of Real Estate and Facilities at Apple, Dan Whisenhunt show a rendering of the proposed campus, which they say will be 80 percent open space and parkland . Tucked away: A road leading to an underground parking space, which will hide unsightly parking areas and allow for more green space . The building stays eco-friendly with natural ventilation that works instead of air-conditioning for 70 percent of the year, low energy LED lighting where natural light doesn’t reach, and on-site recycling. ‘This will be one of the most environmentally sustainable developments on this scale anywhere in the world,'’ said Apple’s Whisenhunt. In the center will be an enclosed arboretum and orchard complete with thousands of fruit, oak, and olive trees according to the San Jose Mercury-News. ‘We love California, and by adding over 2,500 new and indigenous trees that truly belong here,’ Oppenheimer said, ‘we're bringing back the beautiful orchards that once made up this valley.’ Almost there: Apple executives will meet with Cupertino, California officials on Tuesday in a bid to get final approval for the plans . Pleasant: The cafeteria will be enclosed with a four-story open atrium and allow for both indoor and outdoor seating . Surrounding the building, will be even more green space as part of the planned 80 percent open space and parkland. Currently, the 175-acre site is 80 percent asphalt and the buildings that once housed Hewlett-Packard. 'The . concept of the building,' Oppenheimer said, 'is collaboration and . fluidity. It'll provide a very open-spaced system, so that at one point . in the day you may be in offices on one side of the circle and find . yourself on the other side later that day.'

Punts . glide serenely on the  water during the last sunny days of autumn… a . family picnics on a grassy bank… ducks paddle silently by. But . then the peace is shattered by a swan named Asboy – and no duck, boater . or passer-by is safe as he continues his father’s mission to terrorise . the waterways of Cambridge. Unless, that is, you happen to be one . ton of prime British bullock. Confrontation: The violent swan known as 'Asboy' came face to face with a bullock yesterday . Loser: Asboy was forced to back down by his much bigger rival on the tow path . The River Cam’s most vicious swan met its . match in one particular opponent who apparently decided enough was . enough. With all the confidence gained from months of scaring off . intruders on its city centre territory, the cocky cob had squared up to . the bullock which had been grazing quietly nearby. Seconds later, however, the swan was forced to retreat when the beast drove him back into the water. The scene was a rare defeat for Asboy, son of another swan that famously ruled the roost on the Cam. Mr . Asbo, as his dad was nicknamed, spent most of his life chasing . canoeists and boaters and biting intruders before conservationists . relocated him 60 miles away and clipped his wings to stop him returning. Escape: The swan proceeded to hop back into the river, watched by the large bullock . Victory: The encounter was a rare defeat for Asboy, who has developed a fearsome reputation on the Cam . That was nearly 18 months ago. Then, last summer, Son of Asbo stepped . in to carry on the family tradition. The chip off the old block . also turned his anger on fellow swans. This weekend, horrified tourists . saw Asboy ferociously grab a passing swan by the neck with his beak, . hold it under water for 15 seconds – then sit on it to stop it wriggling . free. The hapless victim escaped the attack only when its partner came . to the rescue. ‘I have never seen such a vicious swan,’ said . nearby resident Thomas Ellis, 52. ‘He appears to be even worse than his . dad. I’ve seen him swimming up and down the river close to the punts and . he has even attacked a few punting poles. Earlier: Asboy was seen suddenly attacking another swan and biting it in the neck . Vicious: Asboy is the son of 'Mr Asbo', who has been moved after terrorising rowers and tourists . ‘People fear he will be a repeat of his dad and some are now too frightened to go out on the water when he’s around.’ The . bullock versus swan encounter happened when Asboy left the water to . challenge the grazing creature. Unperturbed, the bullock simply advanced . to push the swan back down the bank. ‘I don’t think the swan . was  ever going to win that particular fight,’ said a riverbank . spectator. ‘The bullock really put him in his  place – but I got the . feeling it was a tactical withdrawal. 'I’m sure Asboy will live to fight . another day. I don’t think we’ve seen the last of that particular swan.'

Iain Duncan Smith told the Commons that Brussels is seeking to unpick Britain's existing deterrents to benefit tourism . Britain will ‘utterly refuse’ to water down rules on benefit claims by EU immigrants - and is winning support from other countries for tighter regulation, ministers said yesterday. The Government is embroiled in a deepening row with the European Commission over so-called ‘benefit tourism’, with bureaucrats in Brussels saying there is no evidence people are attracted to the UK by its welfare system. It says the rules will only be looked at if Britain could show evidence of ‘systematic, widespread abuse of benefits by EU migrants’. But France has joined Germany in . indicating that it favours a tightening of the rights attached to . freedom of movement across the Continent, sources suggest. Work . and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith told the Commons that Brussels . is seeking to unpick Britain’s existing deterrents to benefit tourism. ‘Our own assessment – our habitual . residency test – currently prevents people who could be working and not . on benefits from claiming those benefits. It is the Commission that is . trying to get us to change that, and I am utterly refusing to do so,’ he . said. Downing Street said there was ‘widespread and understandable concern’  over people coming to the UK and  being able to access benefits. But in an extraordinary attack on the Coalition, the Commission said it had been asking for figures on the extent of benefit tourism in the UK for three years but the  Government had consistently failed to produce them. Spokesman Jonathan Todd said ‘one can but sincerely hope’ for ministers to set the record straight. ‘The vast majority of migrants go to the UK to work, and they actually contribute more to the welfare system than they take out, purely because they tend to be younger than the average population, and of working age,’ Mr Todd told the BBC’s Daily Politics programme. ‘The more EU migrants you have, the better off your welfare system is.’ The Commission insisted its own report showing there are more than 600,000 ‘non-active’ EU migrants in the UK did not provide enough evidence for them to act, since the figure included older schoolchildren, students, the spouses of migrant workers, and retired people. Only around 38,000 EU migrants in the UK are claiming Jobseeker’s Allowance, it added. The report also disclosed that the number of EU migrants coming to Britain without a job increased by 73 per cent in the three years to 2011. A spokesman for the Work and Pensions department said: ‘It is absolutely right that we have strict rules in place to protect the integrity of the British benefits system and make sure it is not abused. ‘That is why we are pressing ahead with strengthening the habitual residence test and time-limiting how long some migrants can claim benefits. ‘We are also determined to fight court action by the European Commission who want to challenge a key part of our safeguards to ensure that benefits are only paid to people who are legally allowed to live in Britain.’ The Government is embroiled in a deepening row with the European Commission over 'benefit tourism' The department said that as of February this year, more than 5.6million people were claiming working age benefits. Of these 397,000 – 7 per cent – are estimated to have been non-UK nationals when they first registered for  welfare. This is an increase of more than 100,000 since 2008, when the figure was 288,720. Prime Minister David Cameron’s official spokesman said: ‘There is an issue around access to the welfare system, around fairness as well as a cost issue. We don’t think the current system is working, that is why we are looking at changes across the board.’ As well as examining benefit rights, the Government is currently conducting an audit of the cost to the NHS of ‘health tourism’, he added. Conservative backbench MP Stewart Jackson said: ‘The strain in hot-spots, like my own constituency of Peterborough, is very, very acute, and I think that’s why we’re right to be saying there is an element of benefit tourism, particularly from the Czech Republic and Slovakia, and the Government is absolutely right to be saying to the European Commission, “Thus far and no further”.’ UKIP leader Nigel Farage claimed there was a risk of another ‘very large wave’ of immigration from the EU as a result of the economic crisis on the continent and the end to transitional controls on migration from Bulgaria and Romania.","Government embroiled in deepening row with European Commission .

Two proud parents with nine children under the age of seven have welcomed home the first of their new quintuplets - as they swear they didn't use fertility drugs to conceive them. Evonne and Deon Derrico from Las Vegas already had a seven-year-old daughter, a three-year-old son and one-year-old twin boys when they learned they were pregnant with five more babies. Evonne gave birth to two boys and three girls at the Banner Desert Medical Center on September 6, and this weekend, they brought home three of the newborns to a very excited welcoming committee. Speaking with the Today show, the parents shared their joy at having most of their family home. Scroll down for video . Nearly there! Evonne and Deon Derrico, pictured on the Today show on Monday, have welcomed home three of their five quintuplets. The couple now has nine children under the age of seven . Joy: The couple, pictured with three-year-old Deon and one-year-old twins Dallas and Denver, looked surprisingly relaxed as they said everyone is getting enough sleep and they are sticking to a schedule . 'I wanted a large family,' Evonne said. 'No one . expects that overnight but I wanted a large family... So this is just a blessing from God. It really is. It's a dream come true.' The couple hopes to bring another of the newborns home next week and the final baby - Daiten, who was born weighing less than two pounds - the following week. 'As a mother with nine children, you often . think, ""Do I have enough love for all of them?""' Evonne said. 'I think that's been my . number one priority. I don't want anyone to . feel neglected or unloved.' Their doctor had initially told the Derricos that they were expecting four babies, before revealing that there were actually five. Back home: Three of the babies, who were born after 32 weeks on September 6, have returned home to the family in Las Vegas. The other two babies will go home over the next two weeks . When quintuplets are not all the same gender, they could be fraternal quintuplets or a mixture of identical and fraternal. Fraternal . quintuplets are conceived when five separate eggs are released by the . mother and each egg is fertlized by a different sperm. But having quintuplets this way naturally is extremely rare. Instead, quintuplets of different genders could be . a mixture of fraternals and identicals. In identical twins or triplets, . the mother releases an egg which is fertilized by one sperm before . splitting to form identical twins or identical triplets. This means that the Derrico quintuplets could have been formed in a number of ways. All could be from five separate eggs (fraternal) or from as few as two eggs (a set of twins and a set of triplets), three eggs (two sets of twins and another egg), three eggs with a different combination (one set of twins and two other eggs), four eggs (one set of twins and three other eggs) or any similar combination. At . 22 weeks of pregnancy, after they discovered they were expecting . quintuplets, the family moved to suburban Phoenix for care from Dr. John . Elliott, a perinatologist and multiple-birth specialist. After spending her last trimester on bed rest, Evonne gave birth after carrying the babies to 32 weeks - and nearly doubled the family in less than five minutes. Each was delivered between 11.17am and 11.21am on Friday, September 6. In keeping with family tradition, the babies' names all start with the letter 'D': Deniko, Dariz, Deonee, Daician and Daiten. They joined the Derricos' seven-year-old daughter, Dai, a . three-year-old son, Deon, and one-year-old twin boys, Dallas and . Denver. The mother didn't know the babies' genders prior to birth, hospital officials said, and she announced . 'boy' or 'girl' as each baby was presented to her in the delivery room. Even . though they already had twins and have other multiple births in their . families, the couple was stunned. Doctors said they chances of her . carrying quintuplets was one in a couple of million. 'We're not shocked to have the twins,' Deon told Today. 'We . wouldn't have been that shocked to have had twins again, but we could . have never expected this.' Video source TODAY . Making his entrance: Deniko was the first of the . quintuplets to arrive at 11.17am on Friday September 6 . Tiny tot: Dariz was the next boy to arrive one minute later - all weighed less than three pounds at birth . Here come the girls: Deonee was the first sister born at 11:19am - their genders were not known prior to birth . Give me five: Daician was the next girl to be born, one minute after Deonee . Under surveillance: Daiten was the last of the . quintuplets to be born at 11:21am - and although she has put on a pound since she was born, she is expected to return home in about two weeks . Growing: Deon and Evonne Derrico with their . four children, Dallas, Denver, Deon and Dai, before the quintuplets .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 15:55 EST, 14 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:09 EST, 14 October 2013 . Jury selection is finally scheduled to begin tomorrow in Miami for the 2007 murder of All-Pro safety Sean Taylor, after numerous delays. Eric Rivera, now 23, was only 17 at the time of the shooting but faces life in prison for first-degree murder instead of the death penalty if convicted. Jury selection is expected to take four days. There have already been at least . seven previous trial dates set for Rivera. Cooley, for one, said it's . time for justice to be done. Redskins football player Sean Taylor, pictured in 2004, was murdered in 2007 during a violent home invasion in Florida . The last trial date was postponed . when Rivera fired his  attorney, meaning his new lawyer required more . time to work on his case. Nearly . six years ago, Redskins player Sean Taylor was at home nursing an . injury instead of taking the field with his Washington teammates for a . road game at Tampa. A group of young men from southwest Florida drove across the state intending to burglarize Taylor's Miami-area home, thinking he wouldn't be home. When the 6-foot-2, 230-pound player, well known as a ferocious hitter, confronted them with a machete early on Nov. 26, 2007, Eric Rivera Jr. allegedly fired two shots. One missed. The other hit Taylor in the upper leg, causing massive blood loss that led to his death a day later at age 24. Four other people were also charged in the case. One of them, Venjah Hunte, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and burglary charges and is expected to testify against Rivera. The other three are scheduled to go to trial later on lesser charges. Hunte's plea deal calls for a 29-year prison term instead of life. Although Taylor had some run-ins with the law and been fined several times by the NFL for various rules violations, his future seemed extremely bright before he was killed. Eric Rivera, pictured in 2007 after his arrest, faces charges of first degree murder . The son of Florida City Police Chief Pedro Taylor and an All-American player at the University of Miami, the Redskins drafted Taylor with the fifth overall pick in the 2004 draft and he signed an $18 million contract. Taylor quickly became a starter and was nicknamed 'Meast' by teammates, a combination of man and beast, because of his hard-hitting style. He was named to the Pro Bowl after the 2006 season and was also very popular among Redskins players and fans. One of his best friends, wide receiver Santana Moss, said he still says 'a little prayer' for Taylor every time he takes the field. 'I have a few people that have passed away in my life as friends that have meant something to me, and I'm always constantly speaking to them. That's just something I do. He's one of those guys,' Moss said. The Redskins contributed $500,000 to a fund for Taylor's young daughter after he died and, in the first game after his slaying, the team's defense took the field against Buffalo with only 10 players on the first play — leaving Taylor's free safety position vacant to honor him. Fans at that game got towels bearing his number, 21. To many fans, players and others connected with both the Redskins and the U' at Miami, it was heartbreaking to see such a talented player's life and career cut short so brutally. 'He was a young man who was learning quickly how to be a great human being, and, to me, he was the best football player I've ever seen in person,' said former Redskins tight end Chris Cooley, a nine-year veteran who now does broadcasts for the team. 'He was the most physical, the most gifted, the hardest-working guy that I've been around, and it was such an unfortunate thing.' Former Redskins coach Joe Gibbs, now a NASCAR racing team owner, said Taylor began to mature and take a leadership role on the team after the birth of his daughter. 'It wound up being a true tragedy and it had a huge effect on all of us,' Gibbs said of Taylor's killing. 'He was one of those guys that with the way he played and his persona the way he was, he was a natural leader. You could see guys look to him from a leadership standpoint.' The fatal attempted burglary was not the first time there was a break-in at Taylor's home. Police say someone pried open a window a few days earlier, on Nov. 17, and rifled through a desk and other belongings. No one was home that time, and it's not clear exactly what, if anything, was taken. Free Safety Sean Taylor of the Washington Redskins seen playing against the New York Jets in November 2007 - just three weeks before he died . Then came the weekend after Thanksgiving with the Redskins playing the Buccaneers that Sunday. Taylor was given permission to stay home with a knee injury, along with his girlfriend, Jackie Garcia, and their 18-month-old daughter, also named Jackie. Police say two of the men charged had connections to Taylor: Jason Scott Mitchell had cut Taylor's lawn and an older cousin of suspect Charles Wardlow had dated Taylor's sister. Family members also said Mitchell had recently been at a birthday party at Taylor's house, where Taylor was known to keep large amounts of cash. Miami-Dade County's former police director, Robert Parker, said the defendants were surprised to find Taylor home early that Monday morning. 'They were certainly not looking to go there and kill anyone,' Parker said. 'They were expecting a residence that was not occupied.' Authorities say they have obtained confessions from at least some of the suspects, all from the Fort Myers area, but pretrial hearings on whether those statements will be allowed in Rivera's trial were closed by Circuit Judge Dennis Murphy. The judge also imposed a gag order on prosecutors and defense attorneys in hopes of limiting pretrial news media coverage that could make jury selection difficult. The murder weapon has never been found. Prosecutors say it was thrown into the Everglades after the slaying while the group drove home across Alligator Alley. 'Breaking into someone's home, into their personal safety blanket and shooting them in that environment is the most heinous, unthinkable crime that could have happened to a guy like Sean. It's despicable,' Cooley said.","Eric Rivera faces first-degree murder charges for the 2007 death of Sean Taylor .

'It was the result of . the visit by Rihanna. The authorities will be more strict towards . inappropriate shows or wildlife attractions,' the district chief added to AFP. Thai tourist officials were left red-faced after Rihanna's tweets underscored the kingdom's seedier side of the sex entertainment industry. She left little to the imagination with her highly descriptive tweets detailing a live sex show. The 25-year-old Umbrella singer visited the club in the town of Patong and revealed in one tweet that during a performance, live animals including a bird and two turtles were used. Pop singer by day, unintentional animal activist by night: Thai police arrested two men for selling photo ops with protected-species the slow loris after Rihanna posted a picture of herself with one on Instagram . Last month Thai police raided a tourist trap in Bangla Road, Phuket after Rihanna also posted a picture of her snuggling up to a protected species - a slow loris . She was in Thailand enjoying a brief break from her Diamonds World Tour when she ran in to trouble two nights running. On Sept 20 she posted a link on Twitter to an Instagram photo that showed . her in sunglasses snuggling up to a furry primate called the slow loris, . and wrote: 'Look who was talkin dirty to me!' The slow loris, a squirrel-like animal with big eyes, is native to Southeast Asia and is listed as a protected species. Use . of the slow loris and other protected species for tourist snaps - while . common in Thai tourist resorts - is officially illegal. Thai police must have been keeping . tabs on Rihanna, because after she posted the picture, police in Phuket raided Bangla Road the following . day to hunt out touts peddling the lorises for pictures with tourists. 'I . had an order from the Phuket Governor to do a raid today after Rihanna . posted a photo of her with the loris,' Awat Nithikil, leader of the . patrol officers and senior forest academic at Khao Phra Taew Forest . Preserve, told the Phuket News. 'It . is very difficult to do the raids because the touts have spies. If . someone hears that the police are coming their way, there will be a . person who calls the touts and tells them to move,' he said. Vulgar: Rihanna visited a sex club in Thailand over the weekend and documented the experience in a series of tasteless Tweets . Shocking: Rihanna gave a detailed description of what she saw at the nightclub...and even she was shocked . But this time police were successful and apprehended two touts who were selling pictures with lorises. The next night she posted the Tweet saying she was 'traumatized' by the live sex show had witnessed involving animals. She then travelled to Singapore for her next concert on her Diamond Tour. She is now in South Africa. Back to business: Rihanna left her Thailand trouble behind her performing here on Sunday night in Singapore .

Colin Firth bought a whole new audience to the work of Jane Austen when he emerged from a lake with a wet shirt in the BBC adaptation of her classic novel Pride and Prejudice. Now the scene that set viewers' heart racing has been commemorated in a hugely unusual way - with a giant version of the character Mr Darcy emerging from a lake in London's Hyde Park. The fibre-glass made sculpture . caused a stir amongst passers-by as well as wildlife as it rose up from the Serpentine over the sunny weekend. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Pride of place: The giant Mr Darcy model stands in the Serpentine lake in London's Hyde Park . Larger than life character: At 12ft tall, the sculpture dwarfs a row boat . Swimming with the swans: The statue perfectly recreates a wet shirt look . The inspiration: Colin Firth as Mr Darcy in the 1995 BBC adaptation . The model took a team of three . sculptors more than two months to design, construct and paint and measures 12 feet - the equivalent to . the height of a double decker bus. The version of the romantic hero is largely based on Firth's portrayal but lead lead sculptor Toby Crowther said they also got inspiration from the book and the other actors who have played Mr Darcy over the years. In the making: The model took a team of three sculptors more than two months to design . Challenge: Project manager Toby Crowther and sculptor Andy Billett carry the giant head before it's ready to be painted . Various sources: Toby said they were inspired by the book and other portrayals of Mr Darcy to create the statue . He said: 'We took Colin Firth's famous lake scene . as a starting point for creating Mr Darcy but we also read the book and . looked at performances of the brooding hero by Matthew Macfadyen, David . Rintoul and even Laurence Olivier. 'The challenge for us was capturing . the spirit of Darcy as handsome and noble but also aloof and proud. The . Mr Darcy sculpture is a real mix of the many portrayals of Jane . Austen's most famous hero.' A swimmer takes a closer look at the statue: It will soon go on tour around the country before being placed at Lyme Park where the famous scene was filmed . The installation was commissioned to celebrate the launch of UKTV's new TV channel Drama and Mr Darcy was chosen because Colin' Firth's lake exit from the BBC's 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice was named the most memorable British TV drama moment of all time in a recent survey. Adrian Wills, general manager of UKTV . channel Drama said: 'The giant Mr Darcy in The Serpentine is a fitting . tribute to one of the most memorable moments in British TV drama. Jane . Austen spent a lot of time walking in Hyde Park and along the banks of . the Serpentine so we would like to think she would have approved of our . new dashing Darcy.' Those outside London don't have to miss out on the homage. Mr Darcy will embark on a short regional tour to venues including Scarborough beach, before it is installed at Lyme Park in Cheshire, where the scene was first filmed. It will remain in place in the lake at Lyme Park until February 2014. Since 1995, Colin Firth has become a spy and the King of England, played gay and straight men and portrayed a family man as well as a bachelor. He's won countless awards, including an Oscar for the King's Speech, yet for many, he will always be Mr Darcy. 'I dare say if I did spend my waking hours reading my own fan mail I probably would feel Darcy was following me around,' he once told the Daily Mail. 'But I've got family and friends and children and none of them call me Mr Darcy.' Acclaimed: Colin Firth won an Oscar for The King's Speech - but for many he'll always be Mr Darcy . The actor admitted he had never read Jane Austen's novel before taking the role and nearly turned it down because at 35, he couldn't believe he was romantic lead material. And while the part made him a household name, he admitted it wasn't always easy being constantly associated with a literary hero. He said: 'In the years between Pride and Prejudice and Bridget Jones, I don't think there was a single interview in any newspaper that didn't have Darcy in the headline.' Romantic hero: The actor admitted he hadn't read Pride and Prejudice before he took the role . But while for a time he may have resented the fact he could never escape the role, by taking part in the film adaptations of Bridget Jones's Diary the now 52-year-old has proved he can have a sense of humour about it. Author Helen Fielding was inspired by Jane Austen with her bestselling books on hapless Bridget. The character had a crush on Colin Firth in the BBC's Pride and Prejudice and her own love interest was called Mark Darcy. Darcy again: This time in Bridget Jones's Diary . In a stroke of casting genius, Colin Firth takes on the role of Mark Darcy in the films (a third is currently being produced) and one scene where he fights with Hugh Grant's character in a fountain pokes fun at his infamous lake scene. Neither Firth or the director of the BBC production, Simon Langton, had any idea how iconic the scene would become, still beloved by audiences 18 years later. Mr Langton told the Daily Mail: 'Nobody had the slightest inkling that Colin Firth, wearing a lightweight cotton voile shirt with his nipples showing underneath, would have such an effect.'

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg addressed young people at a business start-up centre in London . Nick Clegg weighed into the row about rising energy bills yesterday, claiming that scrapping green taxes would make household bills higher in the long run. He struck a different note from David Cameron, who said last week that green levies should be phased out as quickly as possible. The levies account for 10 per cent of the average energy bill and are set to reach a third by 2020. Despite the focus on how to reduce the cost of living, Mr Clegg said yesterday that subsidies for windfarms and nuclear power were needed to spur the investment needed to keep the lights on. Addressing young people at a business start-up centre in London, he said: ‘Like everyone else I want us to strain every sinew to keep those bills down – but I don’t think anyone should think that by scrapping all the levies suddenly with one bound we will be free. We won’t’. ‘Actually what will happen is that you will have less investment, probably higher bills over time and an increase in fuel poverty. That cannot be the right answer. The whole point of putting some of these levies on bills is to make sure that we do keep lights on.’ Mr Clegg added: ‘People’s bills go down over time by making sure that their homes are more properly insulated and that fuel poverty is properly tackled. Of course we need to keep everything under review – I don’t want to see a penny more going on to bills than is strictly justified.’ In York last week, the Prime Minister said that green taxes ‘should not be there for a moment longer than are necessary... as soon as those industries can pay for themselves’. Mr Clegg’s remarks came after the boss of a power firm warned that bills could rise even more sharply than expected because of a £1billion new tax to boost green energy. Mr Clegg¿s remarks came after the boss of a power firm warned that bills could rise even more sharply than expected . Alistair Phillips-Davies, chief executive of SSE, which last week announced an inflation-busting 8 per cent increase in bills, criticised the ‘carbon price floor’ imposed by ministers in April. He released figures showing the cost to domestic consumers of the carbon price floor would be £194million this year, £374million next year and would soar to £709million in 2015. This means another £7 on the average household bill this year, £15 next year and £26 in 2015. It was likely ‘to have a significant impact on consumer bills’ in future, he said. The tax is designed to make suppliers use less gas, coal and oil and support the growth of low-carbon energy. But analysts have warned that it could drive 60,000 more households into fuel poverty and Tony Cocker, boss of E.ON UK, has described it as ‘a stealth poll tax’. The carbon price floor is a tax on fossil fuels used to generate electricity. Power plants and manufacturers have to pay £16 for every ton of carbon dioxide they emit, rising to £30 by 2020. The cost is passed on to customers. The Department of Energy and Climate Change forecasts that all the various green levies will add £286 a year to the average power bill by 2020. Officials claim this is less than households would pay without green energy.","The Deputy PM struck a different note from David Cameron who said green levies should be phased out .

Surrounded by supporters chanting his name, Venezuelan Melamed crossed the finish line to whoops and cheers, the very last of 45,000 runners who participated. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Triumphant: Maickel Melamed made slow and steady progress and finally crossed the finish line after almost 17 hours of exertion . Melamed suffers a rare muscular condition similar to muscular dystrphy. His condtion, generalized muscle hypotonia, was caused by a complication during birth from nuchal cord, which occurs when the umbilical cord becomes wrapped around a fetus' neck. Hypotonia causes low muscle tone, which makes most activities that require any strength extremely difficult for sufferers. Doctors told Melamed's mother he would never walk. Endurance: The Chicago marathon was Melamed's third; he completed the New York Marathon in 2011 and the Berlin Marathon in 2012 . Melamed began running marathons two years ago, successfully completing the New York city Marathon in 15 hours and 22 minutes after two years of training in his hometown of Caracas. Today, with an entourage of almost 30 people, Melamed finished the 26.2-mile course in Chicago. It was his third marathon, having already competed in New York City in 2011 and the Berlin marathon in 2012. Accomplished: Melamed is also an economist, psychotherapist and motivational speaker . 'If you dream it, make it happen. Your life is the most beautiful thing that can happen to you. So, make the best of it,' Melamed said after the marathon.

I'm not high maintenance: The princess, here with her husband, refutes nickname 'pushy' Her cats are brought their breakfast on trays carried by servants, she has only braved the high street once in 35 years, and she was horrified when she was told she must ‘downsize’ and reside full-time in Kensington Palace. Princess Michael of Kent, however, insists she is ‘not very high maintenance’. In a series of revealing interviews to promote her first novel, the royal – nicknamed Princess Pushy – opened the door to her regal lifestyle. She said she slept in separate quarters to her husband Prince Michael, so they were ‘fresher for each other’. And she said she never learned to cook because she always knew she would have a personal chef when she married. In the frank interviews, she revealed that she disliked her granddaughter Maud’s name and confessed she had never worn Spanx underwear because she feared the fat would be forced south and make her legs ‘bulge out’. The 68-year-old also said she ‘unashamedly hates’ the foxes that roam outside the palace – a problem, she says, that was exacerbated by her neighbour, the Russian ambassador and his wife, who ‘used to feed them’. Speaking to The Sunday Times Magazine, she recalled the moment when she was told she would have to sell their £5.7million 16th century mansion, Nether Lypiatt, in Gloucestershire. They sold the house in 2006 to meet the £120,000-a-year rent on their five-bedroom apartment at Kensington Palace, after being told they could no longer pay a subsidised ‘peppercorn rent’ of just £69-a-week. She said: ‘Of course I miss the big gardens we had at our country house but it became very expensive to run... we couldn’t afford it. ‘For the first time that terrible word . came into my life when our private secretary said, “Ma’am, you have to . downsize.” It was the worst word I’d heard in ages.’ Lap of luxury: The Kent family's 18th Century home, Nether Lypiatt Manor at Bisley, Gloucestershire .

A rare handwritten letter from Dambusters hero Guy Gibson discussing the raid and the demise of the Nazi regime has been unveiled. It was penned on 26 June 1943 - just five weeks after he led 617 Squadron's daring mission using the revolutionary bouncing bomb. Thought to be his only letter ever sold, it is expected to fetch £3,000 at auction next month. He was replying to fellow pilot Flight-Lieutenant Cecil 'Ginger' Parkins who had written to congratulate him on the raid and on his subsequent Victoria Cross. Rare: National hero Guy Gibson was replying to fellow pilot Flight-Lieutenant Cecil 'Ginger' Parkins who had written to congratulate him on the raid and on his subsequent Victoria Cross . Gibson says: 'Life in England is much the same with everyone very optimistic. The Ruhr certainly is getting the biggest bashing of its life. How anyone can stick - I just don't know.' One of the most celebrated figures of the Second World War, he masterminded Operation Chastise - the raid on the dams of the Ruhr valley on 16 and 17 May 1943 - which has achieved legendary status. He was in command of 617 Squadron - 19 aircraft that set out to destroy the Mohne, the Eder and the Sorpe dams in the Ruhr Valley so as to damage a vital source of power to the key industrial heart of Germany. RAF ace: Guy Gibson was just 26 when he was killed in 1944 after his plane was downed by friendly fire . The first two were attacked and breached by mines dropped from specially modified Lancasters using bouncing bombs and the Sorpe was also damaged. The daring night-time raid was hailed a success. At the time Gibson wrote the letter he was still in command of the squadron which had been put together specifically to carry out the raids and was based at Cranfield in Bedfordshire. Writing in the style of the day Gibson - who was killed a year later after his plane was downed by friendly fire in a night-time sortie over Germany - gossips about old times. He said: 'I'm afraid Cranfield is not the same gay place it used to be. I must say G/c F.G. (Group Captain Fighter Group) was a wizard for parties. So old Pauline is out Eh? I hope someone married her!' The letter starts rather affectionately 'My Dear Ginger' and goes on to say how nice it is to hear from him again. Although close chums, at the end he signs it off very formally 'Guy P Gibson'. Bonhams spokesman Andrew Currie said: 'Some of the language is quite old-fashioned and have a different context to today - when he talks about 'how anyone can stick' after the Dambusters raids means he doesn't know how the Germans can 'put up with' living there. 'One way of looking at it would be he could have had a little sympathy for those who were on the end of it. 'Cranfield not being as 'gay' as it once was means it was no longer as much fun - this was a common expression in those days. 'But we have no idea who Pauline was - she has been lost in the mists of time.' Mr Currie said the letter - which is being sold anonymously by its owner - will be of interest to private collectors and institutions. India: Gibson had been posted in India in 1943 during the war. The letter passes on tips to Ginger Parkins . Auction: It is expected to fetch £3,000 when it is sold at Bonham's in Knightsbridge on November 12 . 'Life in England is much the same with everyone very optimistic... Well give any of the boys you may see my love' He said: 'Gibson died young and wrote very few letters during his short life as far as we know - ones that have survived are extremely rare.' Gibson had spent his boyhood in India and passed on some tips. He said: 'I'm sure you must love India! It's not a bad place - Now when I was in POONA - I used to make regular trips to catch Prawns in the Irriwaddy!(sic)' Then referring to the Japanese invaders he said: 'You must try the same when the Japs clear out.' The two-page letter is in good condition with only very light dust-staining and spotting. Parkins met Gibson when they were both stationed at Cranfield in either 1941 or 1942. He was posted to India in early 1943 and ended the war as Squadron leader at No 35 PTC RAF, Calcutta. Gibson's Dambuster exploits were an important boost to national morale and he was considered too valuable to risk in further combat. Having accompanied Churchill to Canada and subsequently served as a staff officer he eventually persuaded a reluctant 'Bomber' Harris to allow him to return to the air.

Guy Gibson Vc Dambusters hero with his devoted dog and fellow pilots tending their beloved garden . Mr Currie said: 'This is the only autograph letter by him of which we can find record that has appeared for sale.' It's uncertain when he and Parkins first met but as the letter makes clear they overlapped at Cranfield where Gibson was stationed as Chief Flying Instructor between December 1941 and April 1942. Mr Currie said: 'Family tradition holds he served as Gibson's best man in 1940 but neither we - nor they - have been able to verify this. 'He is however mentioned in Enemy Coast Ahead as having flown Gibson 'to the north of England' in March 1942.' The letter will go on sale at Bonhams in . Knightsbridge, London, on November 12. National treasure: Guy Gibson V.C. (1918-1944), was commemorated with an English Heritage Blue Plaque on June 26 2006 at 32 Aberdeen Place, London, NW8 . Gibson was the perfect choice to lead the 617 Squadron - colloquially dubbed 'the Dambusters'. He had a flawless record, leadership skills and could fly the new Lancaster. He took control of the mission with no idea what was to come. Unusually, the 24-year-old was given the authority to pick his own team. Gibson flew only the Dambusters raid with 617 Squadron despite them flying more precision bombing missions after. The success of the Dambusters made Gibson the most highly decorated pilot in the RAF and gave him a place in history. He was awarded the Victoria Cross - the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Usually, former commanders moved on to senior office-based roles to see out the rest of the war after a successful raid. Army leaders and politicians encouraged him to do so - if he was captured or killed it would have seriously damaged British moral. But Gibson insisted on operational duty. He was initially posted at a Lincolnshire bomber base at East Kirkby on a strictly non-operational basis. However, after persistent pestering from Gibson, they decided to let him lead a bomber squadron into Germany. On September 19th 1944, Gibson led a huge force into Germany to attack railways and industrial targets at Monchengladbach and Rheydt. Gibson did not return from the operation in his Mosquito. Mystery and controversy have surrounded his crash ever since. He orchestrated the attack and ordered the bombers home but was then never heard from again. His Mosquito was seen plunging into the ground at Steenbergen in Holland. Part of his remains were later found. Air Marshal Arthur Harris openly regretted his decision to let Gibson out into the field again. Sir Barnes Wallis, who invented the bouncing bomb, described Gibson, saying: 'For some men of great courage and adventure, inactivity was a slow death. Would a man like Gibson ever have adjusted back to peacetime life? 'One can imagine it would have been a somewhat empty existence after all he had been through. Facing death had become his drug. 'He had seen countless friends and comrades perish in the great crusade. 'Perhaps something in him even welcomed the inevitability he had always felt that before the war ended he would join them in their Bomber Command Valhalla. 'He had pushed his luck beyond all limits and he knew it. 'But that was the kind of man he was… A man of great courage, inspiration and leadership. A man born for war…but born to fall in war.'","617 Squadron leader talks of England as optimistic and of Nazis struggling .

Duke and Duchess of Cambridge plan to choose university and school friends as godparents to Prince George . Kate’s school friend from Marlborough . College, interior designer Emilia d’Erlanger, is also a contender, as is . one of William’s oldest friends Hugh van Cutsem. William is godfather to Mr Van Cutsem’s daughter Grace, who was a flower girl at the royal wedding. A . royal source said: ‘They are rather unexpected off-the-wall choices for . godparents – not the usual suspects of William’s closest friends who we . anticipated.’ The contenders are a world away from the godparents chosen for William, most of whom had royal connections. They included Constantine II, the former King of Greece, and Princess Alexandra, a cousin of the  Queen. The Duchess of Westminster, who was the youngest at 23, was said to be Diana's sole choice for godparent. Prince William's close childhood friend Hugh Van Cutsem (right) and Kate's schoolfriend Emilia d'Erlanger (left) are believed to be among the contenders for the role of godparent . Fergus Boyd shared a flat at university with the Duke and Duchess . Bookmakers last night slashed the odds for Mr Boyd to become a godparent from 8/1 to 1/2, making him the favourite. Ladbrokes said Mrs d’Erlanger was now second favourite at 4/6, while Mr Van Cutsem was third favourite at 1/1. Prince George’s uncle and aunt, Prince Harry and Pippa Middleton, are also in the running at 4/1. It is another sign that the pair is determined to raise their son in their own way. They . have already deviated from tradition by choosing to hold his . christening at the intimate Chapel Royal in St James's Palace, rather . than Buckingham Palace's music room. Mr Boyd knew William at Eton and shared the same hall of residence as the couple during their first year of university. The trio shared a farmhouse together in their second year, and Mr Boyd, 31, witnessed William and Kate's friendship blossom into something more. At a charity fashion show in 2002, as the duchess strutted down the catwalk in a sheer lace dress, William is said to have turned to Mr Boyd and said, 'Wow, Kate's hot'. Ms d'Erlanger introduced Kate to William's circles and remained close to both of them during their split in 2007. Married to David Jardine-Paterson, a friend of William's from Eton, she is reportedly advising Kate on the renovation of their Kensington Palace apartment. The couple have already broken with tradition by releasing this intimate picture by Kate's father as the first official portrait of Prince George and will hold the christening at Chapel Royal in St James's Palace . The couple want to give Prince George a sense of normality as he grows up . Meanwhile, Mr van Cutsem, 39, is one . of William's oldest friends and his late father, also called Hugh, was . close to Prince Charles. William . was an usher at his wedding in 2005 to Rose Astor. Other likely candidates for the role include Prince William's best friend Thomas van Straubenzee, William's longest-serving adviser Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, and William and Harry's former nanny, Tiggy Pettifer, nee Legge-Bourke. Nightclub owner Guy Pelly, a close friend of William's, has already ruled out a role at the christening, after it was reported he had been asked to be a godparent. He said: 'People have been coming up to me and shaking my hand offering their congratulations. They have got it all wrong. I spoke to William about it and he confirmed I am not going to be one.' It comes after the Mail revealed that some senior members of the Royal Family have not been invited to Prince George's christening on October 23 because his parents want it to be an 'intimate, family affair'. Prince William's aunts, Princess Anne and Sophie, Countess of Wessex, are believed to be among those left off the guest list. They recently moved into their new home at Kensington Palace following a £1.5million overhaul. But one Royal expert says there are spooky goings-on at family home that no amount of redecoration can remove. Royal biographer Andrew Morton says Prince George's nursery in Apartment 1A of Kensington Palace is 'notorious' for its ghostly sightings. He said apparitions of the prince's namesake, King George II, as well as Caroline of Brunswick and Princess Sophia, have all been seen. Mr Morton even said that Princess Margaret's housekeeper once reported seeing a woman in Regency dress before it disappeared into a wall. Mr Morton told The Sun: 'Let's hope little Prince George can sleep peacefully in his cot at night.'","Duke and Duchess of Cambridge plan to break with tradition .

"By . Daniel Martin, Whitehall Correspondent . PUBLISHED: . 17:45 EST, 14 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:49 EST, 14 October 2013 . Ministers were accused last night of betraying pensioners over a pledge they will not have to sell their homes to fund care. The Coalition had promised that no one would have to meet the cost while they were alive. It said Government-backed loans would cover hiring home helps and care home fees, and be repaid from the person’s estate after they had died. But yesterday it emerged that, far from being universal as billed, the ‘deferred payment’ scheme will apply as a matter of course only to those with other assets of less than £23,500. Ministers have been accused of betraying thousands of middle class pensioners over a pledge they would not have to sell their home to fund care in old age . The House of Lords heard that the apparent U-turn means tens of thousands of middle-class pensioners will still have to go through the trauma of selling their homes, denying their children an inheritance. ‘This has been done in a back-door manner which disgraces the Government,’ said Labour peer Lord Lipsey. ‘The Government has welshed on the deal.’ It will be up to local councils to decide whether pensioners with assets that exceed £23,250, excluding their property, can have a loan, the Lords heard. Restricting funding to people with assets less than £23,500 means up to 40,000 people might have to sell up every year to fund care . When Andrew Lansley, then health . secretary, announced the scheme in July last year, it was called . ‘universal deferred payments’ – making no mention of a cut-off and . giving the clear impression that everyone would be covered. ‘From April 2015, we will ensure that people will be able to delay selling their home to pay for residential care,’ he said . His announcement followed a report in 2011 by the Dilnot Commission – set up by the Coalition to examine how to fund the spiralling cost of care, which currently forces tens of thousands to sell their homes each year. Its main recommendation was to limit individuals’ contribution to social care costs to £35,000, after which the state would pay. The Government is proposing to implement a cap on care costs of £71,000 to come into force in 2016. However this cap will not include the ‘bed and board’ costs of a care home – some £10,000 a year. Lord Lipsey, a member of a Royal Commission in the 1990s on the funding of care for the elderly, told peers: ‘The original scheme as put forward by the Dilnot Commission has had its b**** cut off by the Government. ‘There is now a huge restriction which will mean that very few people will take advantage of the deferred payment scheme. Labour peer Lord Lipsey said the 'huge restriction means 'very few people' will use the scheme . When Andrew Lansley, then health secretary, announced the scheme, it was called 'universal deferred payments' ¿ making no mention of a cut-off . ‘If you have got more than that you . have to spend down until you get to £23,250 in the bank or wherever it . is and then you can consider a deferred payment scheme. ‘Most . people who have reasonably valuable houses – and they are most of the . people who are likely to be wanting this – will have far more than . £23,250 in other assets and most of them won’t feel the least bit happy . if before they can get any help from the deferred payment scheme they . have to spend down until they have got less than £23,250.’ Health Minister Earl Howe admitted up to 40,000 people might have to sell their homes every year but denied that the Dilnot recommendations had been emasculated. He said there would be circumstances where local authorities must offer deferred payments but the proposed legislation  provided additional powers to offer deferred payments more widely. The Government was consulting on this. ‘We need to ensure that this arrangement is rolled out in a way that is financially sustainable for the local authority in each case,’ he said. Urging ministers to think again, Lord Lipsey warned of a ‘tsunami’ of opposition to the Government’s plans. Labour’s Lord Warner, a member of the Dilnot Commission, said it was ‘pretty rough’ for the Government to give the impression that it was implementing its recommendations on deferred payments ‘when they palpably aren’t’.","Coalition had previously pledged no one would need to sell homes to meet care home costs while they were still alive .

In a emotional 15th birthday message to her daughter Abigail, Zenya Hernandez begged for the schoolgirl to come home . The last call made on a missing New Hampshire girl’s cellphone was last Wednesday about four hours after she was last seen, investigators said on Sunday. Abigail Hernandez, 15, of North Conway was last seen leaving Kennett High School on Wednesday afternoon. Police say she made it home but was gone when her mother arrived later. Police said they have not located the girl’s phone but have determined that the last call was made at 6.30pm. It was used about two miles from her home at a spot near Cranmore Mountain, a ski resort popular with tourists. Several agencies, including the FBI, have been involved in searching for the girl by land, water and air. The mother of the missing 15-year-old pleaded for her daughter's safe return on Sunday, saying: 'Please come home. We miss you so badly.' Speaking in front of Conway police station on Sunday, Zenya Hernandez wished her daughter Abigail a happy birthday. Kieran Ramsey, from the FBI, confirmed today that teams are continuing their searches using five sniffer dog teams. Officers are also canvassing and chasing up tip-offs from the public, though no new information has come to light. Abigail, a Kennett High School student, has been missing since Wednesday last week after walking home from class. The last sighting of the girl, who ran on . the track team for her school and was described as quiet and bright, . was around 2.30pm. Investigators believe Abigail made it back to her home, but when her mother came back from her nursing job, her daughter was gone. The schoolgirl's 15th birthday was on Saturday. Since then local police and the FBI have searched on foot, in boats, and by helicopter but have failed to turn up any new evidence about the disappearance. Zenya Hernandez held a press conference on Sunday at the Conway police station in New Hampshire where she pleaded for her daughter's safe return . FBI fixed-wing planes have been . drafted into the search, and on Saturday lines of officials meticulously . searched four square miles of woodland. Despite . searching over 3,000 acres Major Kevin Jordan of the Maine Fish and . Game Department, said: 'We are nowhere near done. We are here to find . Abi and to bring her home.' Five specially trained teams of sniffer dogs were also used, but so far to no avail. The search has been so thorough that officers have found the body of a hiker who went missing over the weekend, and bone fragments from another case, possibly that of a hiker who went missing in 2006. Both sets of evidence are unrelated to the Hernandez case. New Hampshire's White Mountains are full of tourists at this time of year as they come to take pictures of the leaves changing in autumn. Police, FBI, New Hampshire Fish and Game personnel and volunteers have all helped to search for the teenager but have not found any leads . Sniffer dog teams, police helicopters, and FBI fixed-wing planes have been drafted in as police reveal they have been sent 200 leads from as far away as Texas . This weekend the holidaymakers were handed flyers of the pretty girl and told to watch for anything suspicious. Hernandez's picture was also plastered over store windows in North Conway Village and in the popular shopping mall. Police officials said they are still treating Hernandez's disappearance as a missing persons case, but added that foul play has not been ruled out. So far officers say they have received over 200 tip-offs, some from as far away as Texas. Abigail is 5ft 4in tall and weighs 118lb with . brown hair and eyes.

Price prediction patriarch: Eugene Fama showed decades ago that stock prices are easier to predict years in advance than within a few days . Americans Eugene Fama, Lars Peter Hansen and Robert Shiller won the Nobel prize for economics on Monday for developing new methods to study trends in asset markets. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said the three had laid the foundation of the current understanding of asset prices by developing a prediction model based on fluctuations in risk, risk attitudes and how they interact with behavioral biases and market friction. ‘The Laureates have laid the foundation for the current understanding of asset prices,’ the organization said in a statement announcing the winners. Mr Fama’s study of the financial markets began in the 1960s. He soon theorized that, while stock prices are hard to predict in the short-term, it is actually less difficult to predict long-term fluctuations. He also proved that 'value' and small-cap stocks provide better returns than 'growth' stocks, Bloomberg noted. Building on the revelations made by Mr Fama, 74, Mr Schiller proved that stock prices are much more volatile than dividends paid by a company since they tend to fall as the ratio between them grows. Dividends are based mainly on a company’s performance, but stock prices can be influenced by any number of factors, just one of which is performance. ""These findings, which might seem surprising and contradictory, were made and analyzed by this year's laureates,"" the academy said. Housing guru: Robert Schiller's work led to the creation of the S&P/Case-Schiller housing price index, as well as index funds . Mr Schiller’s 1980s proof of theory led to innovations such as index funds. Similar to mutual funds, these investment vehicles have become popular alternatives to financial advisors for individual investors, Bloomberg noted. His findings also apply to the bond markets. Further proof of Mr Schiller’s impact on the financial world are the S&P/Case-Schiller home price indexes created with Karl Case. Despite his revolutionary findings, Mr Schiller was in disbelief he won. 'I did not expect it,' he said via phone during a press conference announcing the winners, according to Bloomberg. Proof of the last decade’s housing bubble can be seen with home prices doubling in the years leading up to 2006 before cratering during the Great Recession. The housing bubble: The S&P/Case-Schiller housing index shows the steep rise in home prices in the decade leading up to the Great Recession, and the subsequent nosedive starting in late 2006 . Building on the work of predecessors, and in compliment to the two men he shares this year’s Nobel with, Mr Hansen’s research led to the rational investor theory. Mr Hansen set out to show how a rational investor might react when faced with long-term asset price uncertainty, and concluded that borrowing limits and risk restrictions prevent smart investors from trading in mispriced markets. The rational investor: Lars Peter Hansen's rational investor theories led to the modern understanding of trading behavior and risk controls . These findings have led to modern risk controls and long-term risk predictions. Deviations from this theory are able to explain buying and selling in just about any market condition. Mr Fama and Mr Hansen, 60, are associated with the University of Chicago. Mr Shiller, 67, is a professor at Yale University. American researchers have dominated the economics awards in recent years; the last time there was no American among the winners was in 1999. The Nobel committees have now announced all six of the annual $1.2 million awards for 2013. The economics award is not a Nobel Prize in the same sense as the medicine, chemistry, physics, literature and peace prizes, which were created by Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel in 1895. The inventor of dynamite, Mr Nobel died only a year later. Sweden's central bank added the economics prize in 1968 as a memorial to Nobel.","The trio's findings have laid the foundation for the current understanding of asset prices and behaviors .

Forget listening to music, a new slow motion video helps you see your favourite tracks by using paint to show how the sound waves move. Oxford-based SlowMoGuys, also known as Gavin Free and Daniel Gruchy, poured different coloured paints onto a speaker driver cone. As music is played through the speaker, a video shows the the paint bouncing in time with the vibrations created by the music to give a visual representation of the track. Scroll down for video . Speaker driver cones vibrate back and forth to create a change in air pressure, that ultimately creates a sound wave. When these waves hit a listener's eardrums, it causes the drum itself to move forward and backward in a similar motion. This causes the person to hear the sound exactly how its being produced. The cone is moved using an electromagnetic process created by a coil of wire, called the voice coil, at the base of the cone. Electrical . impulses coming from the amplifier, or amplifiers, move this voice . coil, which then interacts with a permanent magnet attached to the . speaker’s cone. In the video, SlowMoGuys, also known as Gavin Free and Daniel . Gruchy, turn the speaker of a 1980s Sony cassette player on its side before pouring the paints onto the speaker driver cone. Music on a cassette tape is then played at full volume through the speakers to highlight which areas of the cone move as the song plays. For copyright reasons, Free and Gruchy don't play the actual song but replace it with stock audio. The green paint is showing rising and falling the most because, as Free explains, it is the most watery, while the more viscous orange paint stays still. During a second test, Gruchy mixes up the various colours so that they each have a similar consistency. Free then adds a macro lens to a Phantom Flex camera and shoots the paint at 2500fps to capture 'the initial blobs of paint just as they rise to the top and look cool.' As the speaker cone vibrates and the paint bounces, the colours mix together and form a cream colour.

Staffordshire Police will become the first force in Europe to have every officer equipped with such devices . The force is spending £330,000 on 500 lapel-worn cameras for officers, PCSOs and volunteer specials. It will become the first in Europe to have every officer equipped with the devices. Police say video footage is much more effective in securing convictions than police verbal accounts, which can be challenged in court. They say the cameras are a huge money-saver because they save court preparation time and often force an early guilty plea. But critics have described them as an unnecessary extension of State surveillance. Nick Pickles, director of Big Brother Watch said: ‘As a bare minimum, no member of the public should be subjected to this kind of surveillance without being fully aware it is taking place, why and how they can access a copy for themselves. ‘This is hardly a measure that will reassure communities that the police are working for them, not treating everyone as suspects to be recorded. ‘Is it worth such a serious shift in the relationship between the police and the public to save a few hours of paperwork, rather than to ask why the paperwork is there in the first place?’ Critics have described the cameras as an unnecessary extension of State surveillance . The cameras record high-definition video and can record sound from up to 20 feet away. Staffordshire’s Police and Crime Commissioner Matthew Ellis said: ‘These cameras are exceptional value for money. ‘They will free up officer time and create thousands of extra hours of visible policing. ‘It will help officers get the best possible evidence. It will protect people who are being arrested and it will save a vast amount of time by providing actual pictorial evidence in court rather than thousands and thousands of words. ‘One of my officers went to break up a fight at a pub in Newcastle the other day - and as soon as he pressed the record button, the fighting stopped.' The move was backed by frontline officers’ representatives. Andy Adams, chairman of the Staffordshire Police Federation, said: ‘I imagine that as a matter of course officers will turn on their camera during violent or domestic incidents, but they will have some discretion over when they choose to record arrests.’ In May, Home Secretary Theresa May said all officers walking the beat should wear body-mounted cameras. As well as helping convict criminals, they help make sure ‘vexatious’ complaints against officers are promptly dismissed, she said. Improvements in technology make them much more affordable than in the past. Mrs May said five forces were already using them routinely in England and Wales. They are also in use in Scotland. She told the Police Federation annual conference in Bournemouth: ‘Body-worn cameras can help improve the collection of evidence.’","Staffordshire Police the first force in Europe to equip every officer .

A Europe-wide study found pregnant women exposed to 'safe levels' of pollution still have an increased risk of giving birth to small baby . Pregnant women exposed to ‘safe’ levels of air pollution still have an increased risk of giving birth to small babies, researchers have warned. Nitrogen oxides and fine particles produced by traffic pushed up the risk of low birth weight by almost 20 per cent, a study found. But the impact also persisted at levels well below those imposed by EU air quality directives. In addition, the average size of babies’ heads was found to decrease, despite accounting for factors such as smoking, age, weight, and education, the study of 74,000 women from 12 European countries found. Experts have now called for new measures to reduce levels of microscopic particles known as PM 2.5. The study by a Europe-wide group of researchers and published in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine journal, found that raising the exposure to pollutants by five micrograms per cubic metre caused an 18 per cent greater risk of small babies. Newborns weighing under 5lb 8oz can suffer health problems later in life. But simply cutting levels of PM 2.5 to 10 micrograms per cubic metre could prevent more than one in five cases of low birth weight, say experts. Lead author Dr Marie Pedersen from the . Centre for Research in Environmental Epidemiology in Barcelona, Spain, . said: ‘Our findings suggest that a substantial proportion of cases of . low birthweight at term could be prevented in Europe if urban air . pollution, particularly fine particulate matter, was reduced.’ Lower birthweight may cause the child health problems immediately after birth and while growing up. Microscopic particles largely generated by diesel exhausts have previously been shown to damage the lungs and cause harmful changes in blood vessels and clotting. Dr Pedersen said ‘The widespread exposure of pregnant women worldwide to urban ambient air pollution at similar or even higher concentrations than those assessed in our study provides a clear message to policy makers to improve the quality of the air we all share.’ Nitrogen oxides and fine particles produced by traffic pushed up the risk of low birth weight by almost 20 per cent . Previously exposure of pregnant women to . traffic-related air pollution has been linked to pre eclampsia, and to . asthma and autism in offspring. Professor John Wright from the Bradford Institute for Health Research, said: ‘Unlike risk factors such as diet and smoking, air pollution is an exposure that we cannot reduce through individual actions. ‘Our research provides a wake-up call to policy makers.’ Dr Patrick O’Brien, spokesperson for The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said ‘Exposure to some level of air pollution is unavoidable in day-to-day life and the risk still remains fairly low. Other factors, such as smoking, high blood pressure or excessive alcohol consumption, may contribute more to the risk of having a low birth weight baby.’ Dr Jenny Myers, NIHR Clinician Scientist/Clinical Senior Lecturer, Maternal & Fetal Health Research Centre, University Of Manchester, said ‘The size of the effect of air pollutants on birthweight was smaller than the effect associated with maternal smoking, so for individual women smoking has the largest effect on low birthweight. ‘For the whole population, however, air pollution has a greater effect because more women are exposed to air pollution than do smoke. ‘The mechanism by which air pollutants cause growth restriction is unknown, but it is plausible that environmental toxins could have a toxic effect on placental growth and function.’","A Europe-wide study traffic pollution increased low birth rate by 20% .

Dr Tony Cole said the Liverpool Care Pathway scandal would not have been exposed without the Daily Mail and a free Press . A leading medical figure who helped abolish the Liverpool Care Pathway has praised the Daily Mail’s campaign as he condemned attempts to fetter the free Press. Dr Tony Cole – who persuaded ministers to set up the official inquiry that led to the demise of the LCP – said: ‘We would never have got it off the ground if it had not been for the Daily Mail and the Press. I am very concerned about freedom of the Press and anything which might endanger it.’ Dr Cole spoke in the wake of the proposal by ministers that newspapers should accept a new regulator which gives MPs a final say in how regulation should work. Newspapers are thought likely to reject the plan by Culture Secretary Maria Miller because they fear it would give politicians power to censor and intimidate the press. Dr Cole, a prominent paediatrician, praised the Mail in a speech at the Royal College of Medicine on Saturday. He said the Press had stood up for truth while the Government and the medical profession closed ranks to try to silence criticism of the Liverpool Care Pathway. ‘Had it not been for the Press, the relatives who have suffered would not have been able to link up and get their stories heard,’ Dr Cole said. ‘That’s why you need a free Press.’ During the summer the Government changed its mind and abolished the LCP following the verdict of Baroness Neuberger’s inquiry. The inquiry found patients and their families were suffering ‘poor care, appalling communications and of a lack of attention or compassion’. The inquiry was set up after the Mail made a series of damaging disclosures about the system, which had been introduced across the NHS hospital network, and which was meant to provide dignity and comfort to patients in their last hours of life. The Government abolished the LCP after an inquiry into standards of care prompted by the Mail's investigations (file picture) This newspaper highlighted the disquiet of senior doctors who thought the LCP was being used to get rid of elderly patients and free up hospital beds. We reported the agony of families whose loved ones had died, usually after being drugged and refused liquids. The Mail also revealed the ‘bribe’ system under which hospitals were paid millions in bonus money in return for hitting targets for numbers of patients dying on the LCP. The official inquiry said in July that desperate patients were being denied water and there were suspicions that patients had been ‘hastened towards death’ for financial reasons. It said the LCP should be abolished. Dr Cole, a member of the Medical Ethics Alliance which campaigns against euthanasia and abortion, was one of two senior medical figures who persuaded Lib Dem Health Minister Norman Lamb to establish the Neuberger inquiry. He said: ‘In this business we have come up against the entire establishment – the Government, the Royal Colleges, the bulk of the medical profession, all closing ranks – and we came in for a fair amount of stick for having actually questioned the LCP. Newspapers are thought likely to reject the regulation plan by Culture Secretary Maria Miller (pictured). Dr Cole expressed concern at any rules that would impinge on the freedom of the Press . ‘But had it not been for the Press, the . relatives who have suffered would not have been able to link up and get . their stories heard. ‘And their stories were absolutely dreadful – people were dying of thirst, people were being rendered unconscious unnecessarily, some very emotionally upsetting things were happening. That’s why you need a free Press.’ Dr Cole spoke as he received the Schindler Prize from disability rights campaigner Baroness Campbell for his work to expose the effects of the LCP. He added: ‘The British Medical Journal published a report that most GPs supported the LCP, but the Press were publishing more and more stories of awful deaths. ‘If I may say so, the demented elderly who were in great danger from the misapplication of the LCP, are now in a safer place. We must all acknowledge the importance of the Press in all of this from their first description of the so-called “death pathway”.’ Dr Cole told the Mail yesterday: ‘The medical establishment were trying to silence criticism. Damn right they were. Health Minister Norman Lamb called the LCP a 'national disgrace' The medical profession condemned the Daily Mail’s disclosures about the Liverpool Care Pathway.A string of professional bodies and charities combined with NHS managers to form a front to isolate and shout down our coverage of the Pathway. On September 24 last year, 22 organisations, including professional associations and the NHS End-of-life Care Programme, united to issue a ‘consensus statement’ endorsing the LCP. ‘Published misconceptions and often inaccurate information about the Liverpool Care Pathway risk detracting from the substantial benefits it can bring to people who are dying and their families,’ it said. On October 18, Royal College of General Practitioners council chairman Dr Clare Gerada said: ‘The RCGP is appalled at the media coverage in the Daily Mail and elsewhere about planning for end-of-life care. 'As well as being inaccurate and deliberately misleading, this coverage is creating unnecessary distress and fear for patients who might be nearing the end of their life and for their families.’ The Lancet, which describes itself as ‘one of the world’s leading medical journals’, said: ‘The reporting of the story has been appalling.’ In July this year, the inquiry set up by the Department of Health found the treatment of many patients on the LCP had been ‘uncaring, rushed and ignorant’ and called for its abolition. Health Minister Norman Lamb agreed, saying: ‘This is not civilised. It is a national disgrace.’ On the day the inquiry reported, Dr Gerada put out a new statement, saying her Royal College ‘supports the move away from the end-of-life pathway’ and adding: ‘We have expressed concern about the implementation of the LCP.’ ‘They were not willing to contemplate any possible criticism. I can remember one chap from a Royal College telling me that he knew hospital registrars were getting it wrong, but that was no reason for them to change their minds.’ Dr Cole, who retired last year after serving as a hospital paediatrician in London and Worcester, spoke as the row over Press regulation appeared to be reaching a crisis. Ministers have rejected a proposal for self-regulation put forward by newspapers that would incorporate the recommendations of Lord Justice Leveson in his inquiry into the culture, practice and ethics of the press. They prefer a system agreed by the political parties in a late night meeting in the offices of Labour leader Ed Miliband, at which several representatives of the anti-Press campaign group Hacked Off were present, but no representative of the newspaper industry. The regulation method proposed by Mrs Miller would be imposed by Royal Charter. It would allow the system to be amended by a two thirds majority in Parliament. Newspapers have indicated they will reject the scheme, which would mean statutory controls on the Press for the first time in 300 years. Documents from GCHQ leaked by US fugitive Edward Snowden (pictured) were reportedly copied on to a USB memory stick and sent by FedEx . The Guardian newspaper reportedly sent top-secret files to the US by household courier FedEx in a move security experts branded ‘astonishing’. Former anti-terror law watchdog Alex Carlile QC said the suggestion that the paper used the courier may have put the lives of British spies in danger. He said: ‘I think it is astonishing that top-secret material has been placed in a public parcel delivery system.’ He also called on the Attorney General to consider legal action against the newspaper and accused the Guardian of playing a ‘parlour game’ with national security. Last week, the head of MI5 warned that publishing confidential documents handed a ‘gift’ to terrorists and caused harm to the work of security services. Security chiefs are ‘very concerned’ at the reported use of the courier service. A source said: ‘Any leak like this is extremely concerning and part of that concern is the handling arrangements.’ Documents from GCHQ, the Government’s secret listening post, leaked by US fugitive Edward Snowden, were reportedly copied on to a USB memory stick and sent by FedEx. Last night, the Guardian refused to say how the material was sent.","Dr Tony Cole persuaded MPs to launch inquiry into Liverpool Care Pathway .

Dan Price was once a successful but stressed out family man in Kentucky but left it all behind twenty years ago to live underground in the Oregon woods. He's the Hobbit hole man who walked away from the 9-to-5 life, dug himself a house under a horse pasture and he has never looked back. ‘When you get rid of things and you’re willing to have less, you’re given a gift of more,’ said Price as he sat in his 8-foot abode. Scroll down for video... Simple life: Dan Price left his workaday family life in Kentucky behind and has lived in the woods of Oregon ever since . Necessities: Price says his 8-foot Hobbit hole in a Joseph, Oregon horse pasture has everything he needs including electric lights . Price once worked as a photojournalist to help support his wife and two young kids and to pay the family mortgage. ‘I told myself, “buck up and pay the bills,”’ Price recalled to NBC News. ‘This is just the way normal life is.’ Then, at 33, Price read a 1974 book called Payne Hollow by Harlan Hubbard, which espouses a rejection of modernity in favor of a primitive lifestyle. Price decided to model his own life after Hubbard’s. While Hubbard found his peace on the shores of the Ohio River, Price headed west to his home state of Oregon. On the cheap: Price lives on $5000 per year and pays just $100 in rent every year for his two acres of land. He does off jobs and publishes a zine about the simple life to make money . Life guides: Price first got the idea to leave his typical life behind when after reading Harlan Hubbard's Payne Hollow, right, about leading a primitive lifestyle. Price himself has published under the pen name Hoboartist, left . He lived in a string of rustic dwellings—a cabin, an old flophouse, even a tepee—before building the tree-covered Hobbit hole out of mostly found materials in Joseph, Oregon. Now, twenty years after seeing the light in simple living, Price is still in his 8-foot dwelling in the ground. In the carpeted, wood-lined circular room, Price has everything he needs. There appears to be electricity in his hobbit hole and a hot plate for cooking. Though it barely seems to fit, a cushion rolls out for sleeping. While he prefers his surroundings relatively bare, Price’s life isn’t without its modern comforts: he has both an iPad and a MacBook Air. He also pays $53 per month for his cell phone. Care free: 縄 don縯 believe in houses or mortgages,' says Price. 'Who in their right mind would spend their lifetime paying for a building they never get to spend time in because they are always working?' ‘I like being able to do what I want to do,’ Price told NBC. Untethered by the workaday lifestyle, Price is free to do just that. Every winter, when life on the horse pasture becomes too cold, Price heads to Hawaii where he surfs each year from November to April. Price supports himself with a zine about his simple lifestyle called Moonlight Chronicles and by working odd jobs. He also penned a book called My Tiny House under name Hoboartist. One around $5000 a year, Price is able to pay the $100 per year rent on his two acres of land, provide himself with necessities, and presumably the travel costs to Hawaii. ‘I don’t believe in houses or mortgages,’ he told NBC. ‘Who in their right mind would spend their lifetime paying for a building they never get to spend time in because they are always working?’","Dan Price parted with his family and job in Kentucky to eek out a living in the Oregon woods .

Tens of thousands of 14-year-olds will leave the traditional classroom two years early and be taught to become chefs, health technicians and carers in plans for a series of technical colleges to be announced today. The so-called ‘career colleges’ – a new network of around 40 technical colleges modelled on technical high schools in New York – will forge links with local employers who will design and help to deliver their curriculum. In one of the biggest shake-ups of secondary schools in more than 60 years, 14 to 19-year-olds will prepare for jobs in the service sector, while also studying GCSEs in maths, English and science. The pioneering colleges are set to offer vocational training in a range of subjects, including construction, catering and healthcare. The plans will be published today by Lord Baker of Dorking, the former Tory Education Secretary. The scheme is backed by Matthew Hancock, the new minister for skills, who will call for more vocational colleges to be opened. Lord Baker said the colleges would provide youngsters with a head start in the workplace.He said: ‘With a million young people unemployed it is a disgrace that we have a skill shortage.’ The plans would build on his network of university technical colleges (UTCs) which specialise in the so-called Stem subjects – science, technology, enginering and maths. Lord Baker said: ‘By starting at 14, youngsters have a head start in preparing for the world of work as they do in Austria, Denmark and the Netherlands, where young unemployment is much lower. ‘We have one million young people unemployed and we are issuing visas to people from overseas who have the skills that are needed – it is about time that we filled the skills gap with our own young people.’ There are already 17 UTCs operating . in Britain, with 27 more in the pipeline and proposals for a further 15 . being assessed by the Baker Dearing Educational Trust. The trust was set up by Lord Baker and the late Lord Dearing, a senior government adviser on education. Cooking will be among many subjects on the curriculum at the new colleges which have link to local businesses. Posed by models . About 40 career colleges are planned over the next four years. At least 140 technical and vocational schools of different types for the 14-19 age group are now planned by 2018. Each career college will teach between 600 and 800 students aged 14 to 19 and each will have the specialisms reflecting skills needed in its local economy. They will follow a similar model to Lord Baker’s UTCs for 14 to 19-year-olds which specialise in engineering, design, construction and applied sciences. Students will wear business dress and have a longer day from about 8.30am to 5pm, with two days a week spent on practical hands-on learning. But with these colleges, the experience will be applied to different industries such as hospitality, finance, healthcare and events management. The first college is scheduled to open in Oldham next year, and will focus on giving its students the skills to work in the digital economy. Former Education Secretary, Lord Baker, will publish the plans today . It will partner with the University of Salford, which specialises in degrees connected to the media.A further four careers colleges are to open, including one in Purfleet, Essex, which will specialise in the creative and cultural industries. Another in Oxford will cover ‘human health’, which includes nursing care for the elderly, residential care and social care in the community. A college opening in Bromley, Kent, will focus on food and enterprise careers. A college covering sports science and the management of sporting events is also in the pipeline. The radical new breed of colleges will not just cover vocational training, but will also ensure their pupils study English, maths and science at GCSE. At present, the division between the two in the UTCs is 40 per cent vocational and 60 per cent academic study. The career colleges will be set up on the sites of existing further education colleges but operate as separate institutions. They will be approved and monitored by the charity Career Colleges Trust. Technical colleges were proposed under the 1944 Education Act and intended to sit alongside grammar schools and secondary moderns, but few local authorities set them up.","Thousands of 14-year-olds will be sent to colleges which vocational skills .

Fighting spirit: 5ft 6ins Rosie Millard screamed as loud as she could until her attacker fled . Her reaction was, by her own admission, ‘pure instinct’ and certainly not what her attacker was expecting. Former BBC arts correspondent Rosie Millard yesterday described how she fought off a 6ft-tall thief who grabbed her mobile phone as she walked her border terrier in a park close to her £2million home. The 48-year-old broadcaster, a mother of four, had decided to take Disney for a stroll and was leaving a message for her husband when the mugger crept up behind her and snatched the device from her hand. However, instead of meekly accepting her plight, Miss Millard, who has a slight build and is 5ft 6ins tall, found herself grabbing hold of the robber and screaming repeatedly as loud as she could. So alarmed was the man he threw Miss Millard into a lavender bush and dropped her Nokia Lumia phone as he fled. Describing her actions as ‘pure instinct’ and probably ‘ill-advised’, she said yesterday: ‘‘I was leaving my husband a message on my phone when I felt this hand coming over my right shoulder and grabbing it. At first I thought it was a friend. ‘It was like a dream. I was thinking: ‘This is actually happening. My phone is being stolen.’ ‘I then grabbed his hand and screamed ‘Aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh’ as loud as I could. There was no one close to me so I just kept screaming. ‘The robber then pulled his arm away because I was screaming so loudly. I’ve got a really loud voice which my children are well aware of.’ Neighbours and a park warden heard her screams and chased after her attacker, who Miss Millard describes as mixed race and around 28 years-old, but without success. The attack took place 20 yards from her £2million terraced home in the fashionable enclave of Islington, north London, at 12.20pm on Sunday. Day job: Here the slight presenter is working on a feature where she tries to get by without a supermarket . Miss Millard praised her neighbours for coming to her aid and the police who arrived within two minutes. She said: ‘‘The park warden and another person came running over. Lots of the neighbours heard my screams and gave chase.’ ‘I now feel more vulnerable and I’m definitely going to keep my phone out of sight. It’s ironic, because I’m always telling my children to be careful where they use their phones. ‘Thinking about it, perhaps I should have let him have the phone because I worry about people with knives. ‘I hope it will make him less likely to attack a woman in the future.’ Prized possession: Miss Millard, 48, clung onto her Nokia Lumia during the 12.20pm attack. The 6ft-tall thief ran . Miss Millard, who is married to TV documentary maker Pip Clothier, 53, also described the incident to her followers on social networking site Twitter. She admitted that her reaction was ‘pure instinct’, but perhaps it was also ‘ill advised’. Last night a Scotland Yard spokesman said officers were called to reports of a street robbery. He said: ‘The area was searched but there was no sign of the suspect. The phone was recovered to its owner. The victim was uninjured.’ The broadcaster was the BBC art correspondent between 1995 and 2004 and now works on a freelance basis. During the coverage of the 2001 Oscars, presenter Michael Buerk said Miss Millard had ‘the best supporting dress’ after she appeared on screen in a daring strapless Vivienne Westwood dress.","Former BBC arts correspondent Rosie Millard fought off 6ft-tall thief .

The Queen is living in ‘crumbling surroundings’ and faces a £50million repair bill to bring her palaces up to scratch, it emerged yesterday. More than a third of the royal estate has been designated as below ‘target condition’. National treasures such as Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle have walls riddled with asbestos, badly need rewiring and have leaking roofs. The Queen pictured in Buckingham Palace with French President Francois Hollande . Staff have to catch the rain in buckets to protect priceless works of art and antiques, particularly in the Queen’s Gallery at Buckingham Palace. Keeper of the Privy Purse Sir Alan Reid revealed that it will cost tens of millions to return royal residences to their former splendour. Details of the Queen’s ‘penury’ emerged as her courtiers were accused by MPs of dragging their feet over a huge backlog of repairs. Sir Alan, the Royal Family’s senior treasurer, was questioned by members of the Commons Public Accounts Committee after a National Audit Office report revealed the Queen will enjoy a 22 per cent increase in income over two years. She is expected to be given £37.9million in 2014/15 to run her Household and conduct official engagements, up from £31million in 2012/13. But most of the state rooms used for . entertaining foreign heads of state have not been decorated since the . Queen came to the throne 60 years ago, while Princess Anne was almost . hit by falling masonry as she got out of her car at Buckingham Palace . just a few years ago. It was claimed staff in Buckingham Palace have resorted to using rain buckets to protect the priceless art hung in the Queen's Gallery from the leaking roof . Keeper of the Privy Purse Sir Alan Reid revealed that it will cost tens of millions to return royal residences,like Buckingham Palace, to their former splendour . Palace . officials blame the backlog on a ‘real terms’ squeeze of up to 60 per . cent in funding by government over the past 20 years, forcing them to . ‘make do and mend’. Windsor . Castle has had its lead roofs ‘patched up’ so many times that an area . the size of both Centre and No1 courts at Wimbledon needs replacing. MPs were ‘shocked at the complacency’ of the backlog, which means some buildings such as Victoria and Albert’s mausoleum at Windsor could be lost to the nation. The ageing Royal Train is likely to be scrapped in the next five to ten years as the cost of replacing it would be ‘staggering’, aides admitted yesterday. Despite now being used by the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh and Prince Charles barely a dozen times a year – at a cost of more than £25,000 per journey – palace officials have always insisted it was a necessary mode of travel. Asked whether it was a ‘sensible’ option in the future or offered ‘effective value for money’, Sir Alan Reid admitted the train, built in the 1970s, ‘doesn’t have much life left in it’. He even confessed it was ‘noisy, slow and uncomfortable’. They also questioned why the Queen’s energy bills have soared by 50 per cent in a year to £3.1million, when money could have been saved if courtiers had had the ‘wit’ to fix their bills as millions of her subjects do. Sir Alan yesterday blamed the high energy costs in part on ‘antiquated’ boilers which have not been replaced for 60 years. Labour’s Austin Mitchell said: ‘I gather from the report that you’ve managed the finances by letting the buildings deteriorate, and freezing staff costs and by digging into the reserves. Work is being carried on while they are living in crumbling surroundings.’ Tory Richard Bacon said he had been told the Buckingham Palace wiring had not been done since 1949. ‘Everyone knows that the longer you leave something, the worse it gets and the greater the overall cost of maintenance and restoration in the longer term,’ he said. Labour’s Fiona Mactaggart said: ‘I have to say I am rather shocked at the complacency, and what I want to know is what you have done to ensure that these buildings are secure for the nation.’ Sir Alan replied: ‘I would love to do the whole of the property backlog right away, but we have limited funds, there’s a head of state to support as well as buildings to maintain. We have to make priorities.’ Some of the rooms in Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle (pictured) haven't been decorated for 60 years . Windsor Castle have walls riddled with asbestos, badly need rewiring and have leaking roofs, it was revealed . He admitted that some 39 per cent of the royal estate was below ‘target condition’. The committee chairman, Labour’s Margaret Hodge, was dismayed when Sir Alan initially said he could not give the precise cost of repairs, a figure he later estimated to be around £50million. After the hearing, Mrs Hodge said: ‘They’ve got to get a bit real. The rest of the world is coping, why can’t they? I was pretty shocked that they hadn’t got a clear view of what work needed to be done, what was the cost and where the priorities lay. ‘You don’t run national heritage assets that way, from hand to mouth. They can serve Her Majesty better.’ Sir . Alan told the committee they were hoping to make ‘major inroads’ over . the next decade. As well as questioning the big increase in energy . bills, MPs asked why the Royal Family’s gas use had soared by 14 per . cent. Sir Alan said that while the . Household did not ‘fix’ its bill, it set up multi-year deals to obtain . power from the wholesale markets. Last . week’s NAO report highlighted previous ‘significant reductions’ in the . monarchy’s funding. In order to cope the Queen’s money men have reduced . net expenditure by 55 per cent in real terms. The . Queen has repeatedly eaten into her savings – known as ‘drawing down on . reserves’ – over the years and is, apparently, down to her last . £1million in the bank.

He is one of Britain’s most prolific and successful novelists. But Anthony Horowitz has revealed how he feared having to give up his lucrative writing career after a serious eye condition threatened to leave him blind. The bestselling author was warned by one specialist that he would have to stop writing after developing cysts at the back of both of his eyes. He admitted that he briefly considered stopping after his vision deteriorated, but concluded that ‘writing is my life’ and that ending his career early would be ‘ridiculous’. He then met with several further specialists, who have said there ‘is nothing that can be done about it’. The 58-year-old, who has penned more than 45 novels and 11 TV series during an illustrious 34-year writing career, told the Lady Magazine: ‘It’s been a very choppy year, health-wise. ‘My South African book tour got cancelled because of a disk in my neck.

Blockbuster success: Horowitz's books have been a hit in the cinema, like the Alex Rider series, Stormbreaker . Among his most popular are the Alex Rider children’s spy series, while he also wrote the Sherlock Holmes novel, House of Silk, which was released in 2011. He has also written the scripts for ITV series Agatha Christie’s Poirot, Midsomer Murders and Foyles War. However, Horowitz has also revealed that due to a series of other health scares in recent years, he now compiles a series of detailed notes about the books he is working on, and which he hands over to his assistant so they can finish the book in case he dies before he finishes. He reveals he works 11 hour days and has just completed his latest Alex Rider novel, Russian Roulette, while working on his second Sherlock Holmes novel and his latest series of Foyle’s War. He added: ‘People say that once you pass the age of 50, all you’re doing is dodging ailments. I don’t think I’m particularly old yet at 57, but these things happen and it just makes me work harder. ‘I do have a funny habit, though. I always leave notes for my assistant on how my books finish, so if I drop dead in the middle of one someone else can finish it. ‘The solution to my new Sherlock . Holmes book is so pleasing that if I died, my last thought wouldn’t be . about my wife and my children but: “Who’s going to finish this book?” Horowitz . has also opened up about how he feel children and teenagers, who many . of his books are aimed at, are being deprived of proper childhoods . because they are ‘stuck indoors, with computer games’. ‘Our children are an unfortunate generation in many ways.

Eric Pickles said the UK should emulate Austria, Belgium and Sweden in rewarding those who dared to build their own homes . Britain should be turned into a 'nation of self-builders' by offering people subsidies for creating their own homes, the Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles has said. Helping tens of thousands of people build their dream properties would stop them from putting up 'homogeneous, pasteurised housing', he claimed. The senior Tory said the UK should emulate Austria, Belgium and Sweden in rewarding those who dared to build their own homes. He revealed that self-builders would have access to a £47 billion loan scheme. Mr Pickles suggested too many people watch Grand Designs and believe building a home was the 'preserve of the elite'. He said he wanted to double the number of self-build projects in the coming years, up from 7,000 today. Ministers want 20 per cent of homes to be self-build projects, up from ten per cent last year. Councils would be encouraged to release land they were holding to residents hoping to self-build. Those already living in the countryside would be less likely to oppose innovative, small-scale developments than large-scale estates, he said. Local authorities would also be urged to reduce red tape so that self-builders did not have to 'bang their heads against walls' to get planning permission. Anyone building their own home would not have to pay a community infrastructure levy, or planning tariffs, slashing the cost of self-building by thousands of pounds. 'We’re taking practical steps which will unlock the potential and will turn our country, which is famously a nation of shopkeepers, to a nation of self-builders too,' Mr Pickles said. 'In some countries - Austria, Belgium, Sweden - as much as half of the new housing is custom built. But they have a system which supports and encourages and rewards self building. We must do likewise.' Mr Pickles said he wanted to double the number of self-build projects in the coming years, up from 7,000 today . He added that the government was working to get self-builders access to finance. 'Because we believe that custom building should not be the preserve of the elite and the wealthy, we’re offering £47billion worth of loans to aspiring self builders,' he said. 'This Government believes in supporting ambition. The more people who build their own homes the better.' Mr Pickles added that the 'level of resistance to self-build small development is much less than some of the larger developments'. Families across Britain should in future be able to design and create a property regardless of how much money they have to spend, he said. Mr Pickles also ruled out 'imposing' new garden cities on parts of the country to solve the housing crisis. Planning Minister Nick Boles has previously called for increasing the amount of developed land in England by a third. He said that this would address the housing shortage. The gap would be filled by building 'beautiful' housing that was sensitive to the local area.","Eric Pickles wants Britain to be turned into a 'nation of self-builders'

Plans to regulate Britain’s 300-year-old free Press are in breach of the law, a senior peer and lawyer is warning. Lord Lester, an eminent QC who is the architect of reforms to Britain’s notorious libel laws, suggested that punishing newspapers that refuse to join a new Press regulator with exemplary damages would violate Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects freedom of expression. The Liberal Democrat peer said: ‘The British Press is subject to our plentiful criminal and civil laws. There is no need for further state intervention, as proposed by the “Hacked Off” celebrity campaigners. ‘We need a system of independent self-regulation that encourages professional standards and provides effective redress, avoiding unnecessary litigation.’ Boris Johnson yesterday urged newspapers to boycott the Government’s proposed Royal Charter on Press regulation, branding the exercise a ‘monstrous folly’. The London mayor said the Leveson Inquiry into media standards had arisen from a ‘string of essentially political embarrassments’, including the MPs’ expenses scandal. Last week, the three main parties agreed the detail of a Royal Charter setting up a system of regulation in the wake of the Leveson Inquiry. An alternative put forward by the Press, which would have meant a new independent regulator having strong investigative powers and the right to impose fines of up to £1million, up-front corrections, with inaccuracies corrected fully and prominently, and independence from the industry and politicians, was rejected.","Plans to punish papers who do not sign up to the new Press regulator would violate human rights laws .

The trend for foreigners to have libel disputes settled in Britain could soon be a thing of the past following a landmark High Court decision. Britain is a popular destination for so-called libel tourism because complainants believe they have more chance of winning a case in our legal system. But yesterday, two libel cases involving allegations of corruption and crime in Eastern Europe were thrown out by judges because they were deemed to have little connection to Britain. No Defamation: Judges ruled that William Browder, pictured, could not have defamed a former Moscow policeman accused of fraud because he had no established reputation in Britain . The decisions were hailed as a victory against libel tourism, which has become an embarrassment to Britain after a number of US states introduced laws enabling their courts to refuse to enforce defamation judgements handed down here. One of the two cases was brought by a former Moscow policeman against City fund chief William Browder, chief executive of Hermitage Capital Management, who said he had covered up a £150million fraud by causing the torture and murder of a prisoner. But Mr Justice Simon said that the policeman, Paul Karpov, had no established reputation in Britain and so could not have suffered harm from the allegations. ‘The connection with this country is limited to the presence of some of the parties and it being the place where some of the defamatory material was, and continues to be, published,’ he said. Justice: Libel tourism become an embarrassment to Britain after a number of US states introduced laws enabling their courts to refuse to enforce defamation judgements handed down here . The judge said that there had been denunciations of the murder in America and Europe, but in Russia the official view was there was no reason for an international response to a fraud against the Russian state and the death of a Russian citizen. The second case was brought by a Serbian tobacco baron, Stanko Subotic, who was accused by banker Ratko Knezevic of murder, drug smuggling and altering his appearance with plastic surgery. Only one copy of the newspaper which carried the allegations, Politika, found in Britain. Mr Justice Dingemans said Subotic had . suffered no damage in England and Wales and that even though there had . been ‘minimal’ internet publication, the case was not ‘worth the . candle’. Media lawyer . Mark Stephens, part of the legal team that successfully saw the Russian . case thrown out, said it was ‘a truly landmark judgment’. ‘Crooks, . brigands and oligarchs will be discouraged from the abuse of British . courts,’ he said.

Carole Waugh, a former oil executive who went under the name ‘poshtottyfun’ on an escort site, told her brother she was close to the Libyan dictator’s family while working as a oil firm clerk in Tripoli.

Her . mother Margaret Waugh, who died two months ago, said in a police . statement that Miss Waugh was ‘obsessed about money’.

Kansas Republican Pat Roberts has been a member of Congress since 1981 and a Senator since 1997, but he's never run this hard to the right before. On Friday he demanded the resignation of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, and his newly minted tea party challenger thinks he knows why. Milton Wolf, a fire-breathing conservative radiologist who's also a second-cousin to Barack Obama, announced on Tuesday that he would run against Roberts in 2014 for the Republican nomination. Three days later, Roberts released a video message saying Sebelius 'won’t shoot straight with the American people' in the face of 'systematic, profound and indisputable' problems with the online rollout of the Obamacare health insurance exchanges. 'If you think those two developments aren’t connected,' a Kansas City Star columnist wrote, 'then you probably think the Kansas Jayhawks are headed for the national championship this year – in football.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Pat Roberts, a Republican senator from Kansas, says Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius should get the axe over the Obamacare website debacle . Barack Obama's fire-breathing conservative cousin Milton Wolf claims his tea-party-fueled challenge to Roberts' re-election candidacy has Suddenly moved the senator to the right . Wolf told MailOnline that Roberts himself bears some responsibility for putting Sebelius, the former Kansas governor, in charge of introducing Obamacare to the nation. 'Of course Kathleen Sebelius should resign,' he said, 'but we wouldn't be in this mess today if it wasn't for Senator Pat Roberts himself.' Roberts, he explained, 'provided the critical support Barack Obama needed to place Kathleen Sebelius in charge of Obamacare. ... [he] publicly endorsed Kathleen Sebelius and voted for her – twice.' Roberts was one of just two Republican senators who voted twice to confirm Sebelius after the president nominated her in 2009 – both in committee and in a final floor vote. (The other was Maine Sen. Olympia Snowe.) But now Roberts is singing a different tune. 'In the absence of a full repeal of Obamacare, which is my preference, we need new leadership from top to bottom,' Roberts declared. 'I am calling on the secretary to resign.' Roberts isn't alone: Robert Gibbs, the communications guru who briefed reporters during much of President Obama's first term, said on Monday that heads should roll over Obamacare -- but stopped short of naming names . Wolf has made a name for himself with a series of Web videos in which he lambastes his more famous second-cousin for being a 'socialist' bent on turning America 'into a second-rate welfare state' Roberts has targeted parts of the Affordable Care, including a vote in March to support a defunding effort spearheaded by Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz. He voted against the law itself, and also introduced unsuccessful legislation in June that would have repealed the Obamacare insurance exchanges if they weren't ready for enrollment by October 1. Wolf, a Kansas radiologist, could give Roberts a run for his money -- or the tea party pressure could make Roberts move further to the right in a state where conservatism wins elections . Since that date, a federal government website operating 36 of the exchanges has been plagued by problems. Millions of taxpayers haven't been able to sign up because of poor technology planning. Two HHS data crunchers told MailOnline that during its first week of operation, just 51,000 people successfully enrolled. Robert Gibbs, the Obama White House's first press secretary, threw gasoline on the fire Monday, telling MSNBC viewers that heads should roll. He didn't specify who should get the guillotine treatment, however. 'When they get it fixed, I hope they fire some people who were in charge of making sure this thing was supposed to work,' Gibbs said. 'This is excruciatingly embarrassing for the White House​ and the Department of Health and Human Services.' Roberts' office didn't respond to a question about whether his sudden turn against Sebelius was driven by politics. But Wolf said in a statement that when Roberts voted to confirm Sebelius in 2009, he 'joined with the Washington insiders and other career politicians and decided to give her even more power that she used to ram through and then oversee the most disastrous government program in our lifetimes.' 'We need more senators like Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, and Mike Lee,' he added later, ,bolstering his tea party street-cred. Star columnist Steve Kraske wrote on Friday that Roberts 'wasn't always so hard right. He was seen as more pragmatic in the ’80s and ’90s and once savaged the Kansas GOP’s rightward plunge in the late 1990s as akin to a death march.' 'Roberts these days is die-hard conservative,' he noted. 'In Kansas, that’s the only safe place to be.' Roberts (C) chaired the Senate Intelligence Committee until Republicans lost their majority in 2007. he also serves on the Agriculture, Ethics, Finance, Rules, and Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions committees . The senator's campaign manager told Reuters last week that 'it will be pretty hard for anyone to get on the conservative side of Pat Roberts.' Roberts told Politico in September that he was indifferent to a primary challenge from Wolf, claiming he is 'not vulnerable' and 'in a very strong position.' 'Obviously the water is fine: Anybody can enter a primary – for that matter, an election,' he said. Wolf, 42, thinks he's up to the challenge, even while he acknowledges that he will likely need to raise $4 million by next year to mount a credible challenge to the 77-year-old senator. 'If you think that the career politicians in both parties have failed America, join us,' he says on his campaign website. 'We are building the Wolf Pack – an Army of Davids to defeat the Goliaths.'","Sen.

President Barack Obama took a break from sorting out the shutdown of the federal government on Monday to make sandwiches for low-income and homeless families. Nobody would argue that feeding the homeless is a noble cause. However, the president's wife might not be too thrilled with what was on the menu. Sticky situation: President Obama makes PB&Js for homeless children. His wife probably won't be too thrilled . Somebody might have some explaining to do as President Obama made PB&Js for homeless people on Monday, which doesn't jibe with his wife's health initiative . Processed: In addition to the PB&Js, Obama packaged up sandwiches made with processed meat - another no-no, if you ask his wife . Dozens of photos were taken showing Obama smearing peanut butter and 'sticky' jelly on what appears to be processed, white bread. Menu option number two appeared to be stacks of processed meat, also on white bread. This doesn't exactly jibe with Michelle Obama's primary initiative as first lady: healthy eating. Mrs. Obama started the 'Let's Move' movement, a program billed as 'America's move to raise a healthier generation of kids.' The first lady has been very vocal - at times even demanding - in her crusade to slim down America's youth. Nailed it: At one point, the president asked for pointers on how to seal a Ziplock bag . Hungry: Martha's Table is a D.C.-based non-profit that provides meals to homeless and low-income families . 'In total, we are now eating 31 percent more calories than we were forty . years ago–including 56 percent more fats and oils and 14 percent more . sugars and sweeteners. The average American now eats fifteen more pounds . of sugar a year than in 1970,' Mrs. Obama's organization explains on its website. Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches have roughly 350 calories per sandwich, depending on the amount of peanut butter and jelly added to the sandwich, according to an online calorie counter. Additionally, a peanut butter and jelly sandwich has 122 fat calories and 46 grams of carbohydrates, which primarily is found in the bread. To promote her initiative, Mrs. Obama even has written a book about the White House garden entitled 'American Grown.' Crusade: Mrs. Obama's crusade to slim down America's youth has even prompted a book about the White House garden . Diet: According to the first lady, The physical and emotional health of an entire generation and the economic health and security of our nation is at stake . Change: According to Let's Move, The average American now eats fifteen more pounds of sugar a year than in 1970 . The book includes gardening tips, recipes and even instructions on how to build your own compost bin. While making the sugary sandwiches at Martha's Table, a D.C. nonprofit that helps low-income and homeless families, the president even joked about how sticky the gooey peanut spread and jelly were. 'Can I just say just in the few moments I've been here I'm feeling a . little sticky,' Obama joked. 'I think I got some PBJ on my fingers.' The situation might get even stickier when the president gets home and has to tell his wife that he's been wrist-deep in peanut butter and jelly all day.","President Obama made sandwiches at Martha's Table, a non-profit that helps feed homeless and low-income families .

A British teacher is believed to have been murdered in Qatar hours after flying back to the Middle East from her grandmother’s funeral. Friends of primary school teacher Lauren Patterson, 24, said she was last seen at a nightclub in the capital, Doha, with two Qatari men, one of whom was an ex-boyfriend. A friend said the ex-boyfriend had since gone to Saudi Arabia and Doha police had taken the other man, who had a bruised lip, in for questioning. Last night there were suggestions from friends that Miss Patterson had left a nightclub at five-star hotel La Cigale with a group of Qatari men and had texted friends to say she was being taken to the wrong house. One close friend posted a message on Twitter saying: ‘Lauren was raped and brutally murdered. Her body was found in the dumpsters behind La Cigale.’ The £180-a-night hotel has three nightclubs. Its website boasts ‘welcome to the best party in Doha’. Miss Patterson was last seen outside La Cigale at 1.20am on Saturday, but it is not clear what happened next. The man who was arrested, a friend of Miss Patterson’s ex-boyfriend, claimed he got his bruised lip after a fight with a taxi driver. He claims the driver had dropped Miss Patterson at the wrong address. Police searched the man’s apartment but he was later released. After Miss Patterson disappeared, her family and boyfriend launched a frantic campaign on Facebook and other social media to find her. But 40 hours later, her boyfriend, James Grima, posted a message saying she was dead. It was followed by dozens of other tributes, praising a ‘truly amazing’ young woman.

Business leaders will today attend a meeting of the Cabinet to unveil a blueprint for the return of powers from Brussels designed to save British firms tens of billions of pounds. In a highly unusual move, the heads of companies including Marks & Spencer and Diageo have been invited to address senior ministers in Downing Street on EU rules and regulations that are hampering economic growth. They will condemn ‘inflexible and unclear’ rules on working hours and the hiring of agency workers, onerous environmental and food labelling rules and a proposal to require 20 weeks’ maternity leave on full pay. Heads of companies including Marks & Spencer have been invited to address Downing Street on EU rules and regulations that are hampering economic growth . In all, they identify 30 areas where ‘problematic, poorly understood and burdensome European rules’ are hitting British firms, with small and medium-sized enterprises particularly badly affected. They also complain that while in the US companies can get new products licensed and to market in a matter of days, it takes weeks or months in Europe. The six business leaders on the taskforce are Marc Bolland, chief executive of M&S; Ian Cheshire, CEO of Kingfisher; Glenn Cooper, managing director of ATG Access; Louise Makin, CEO of BTG; Dale Murray, an entrepreneur; and Paul Walsh of Diageo. David Cameron will take their proposals for reform to a European summit next week in what is being seen as the first stage of attempts to renegotiate a new relationship with Brussels before holding an in/out referendum on EU membership in 2017. In a letter to other EU leaders last night, the Prime Minister said businesses had to do most of the work to kick-start growth, create jobs and foster innovation - and pointed out the European Council had agreed that removing unnecessary red tape was essential to help them thrive. ‘I firmly believe that we need to go further and faster, and we must also put business at the heart of this debate, listening to what they need to successfully compete in the global market place,’ he wrote. The Prime Minister said it was time for Brussels to 'commit to more concrete measures to get rid of the unnecessary regulation which holds our businesses, and Europe, back' The Prime Minister said it was time for Brussels to ‘commit to more concrete measures to get rid of the unnecessary regulation which holds our businesses, and Europe, back’. He added: ‘It’s vital that business can take full advantage of the EU’s single market. 'But all too often EU rules are a handicap for firms, hampering their efforts to succeed in the global race. 'Business people, particularly owners of small firms, are forced to spend too much time complying with pointless, burdensome and costly regulations and that means less time developing a new product, winning contracts or hiring young recruits. 'I’m determined to change that and to get the EU working for business, not against it. ‘At next week’s European Council, I’ll be calling for a clear commitment to sweep away unnecessary bureaucratic barriers and to unleash private sector growth - helping to secure the economic recovery for all.’ Other proposals in the business’ leaders report include scrapping EU-wide requirements for small businesses in low-risk sectors to keep written health and safety risk assessments, which would save businesses across the EU an £2.3 billion a year. The EU should abandon plans to force small businesses, such as one-man gardening firms and carpenters, to pay fees to register to collect and transport waste, even when the materials involved are harmless and the quantities small. Brussels should also fast-track measures to set a maximum cap on the fees that can be applied to card, internet and mobile payments, reducing costs for retailers and consumers. The report also argues the EU should not seek to interfere in the exploitation of shale gas, with estimates that Britain could be sitting on enough gas to meet out needs for 50 years. Simon Walker, of the Institute of Directors, said: ‘Many of these recommendations will be supported by IoD members up and down the country, who too often find their hands bound by European red-tape. Efforts which could otherwise be spent on innovation and investment are instead exhausted battling complex regulatory burdens.’ David Cameron will take the proposals for reform to a European summit next week . European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said: ‘The European Commission has been listening to the concerns of businesses’ and other stakeholders for some time, and I welcome all ideas for reducing unnecessary regulatory burdens. 'In the last five years, the European Commission has slashed the cost of administrative burdens by 32.3 billion euros [£27.4 billion GBP] and scrapped 5590 legal acts. And we are determined to go further. ‘Common rules are essential to make the single market work properly but I also want to make sure that the EU does not meddle where it should not and member states do not add additional burdens.’","Heads of companies such as Marks & Spencer and Diageo invited .

Message: Prep school headteacher Mark Brearey has asked parents to 'avoid bringing any party invitations into school that do not include all children' A headmaster has told parents to invite the whole class when their child has a birthday party – to avoid upsetting those left out. Mark Brearey says including only a smaller circle of friends is ‘divisive and unkind’ to other pupils. A letter from the private mixed preparatory school to parents says its Christian ethic is about being inclusive. But yesterday critics said his policy would only drive up the cost of children’s parties. Mr Brearey, head of Kingswood Preparatory School in Bath, wrote a letter to parents in which he asked: ‘Please could you avoid bringing any party invitations into school that do not include all children in a particular class or year group. This goes completely against our policy of inclusion for every single child and is divisive and unkind.’ Parents criticised the decision, with several using Facebook to call it ‘ridiculous’. Michela Helen Mills said: ‘I think children should be allowed to hand out invites and the head teachers should bear in mind that not all parents can afford to invite the whole class – some classes have 20+ in each class.’ Joanne Oliver said: ‘Kids should invite their friends in numbers the parents have budgeted for. Why invite a kid who’s been harassing you at school all term?’ Jo Whittock added: ‘Most parents do a party on a budget so cannot afford to invite all in the class. Also if you have a theme party you are sometimes limited to a certain number. Kids have to learn that they can’t have everything.’ But several parents came to Mr Brearey’s defence. Nicholas Roper said: ‘He’s not forcing parents to host 30+ kids, just don’t hand out the invites at school. ‘Teaching kids is hard enough without extra drama in the classroom.’ Yesterday Mr Brearey said he stood by his decision, which was designed to prevent children who are left out feeling upset. Grand: The Kingswood Preparatory School building, which said that just inviting a few friends to parties in front of others was 'divisive and unkind' ‘We consider kindness to be one of the key values of our school,’ he said. ‘What . we are saying is that actually handing over party invitations to some . of the group in front of people is not the way we would like it to . happen. 99.9 per cent of our parents are in total agreement with that.’ He . said that if parents wanted to invite just a few of their child’s . friends, they should do it privately, adding: ‘Do it by email, not in a . public place where you find one or two or three people are left. ‘If . children feel like they have been left out by one of the class it can . have a serious impact and it is something that doesn’t need to happen. Why choose to exclude in a public context when you don’t need to?’ Grand: The entrance to the prep schooll in Bath, Somerset, which costs up to £20,000 a year . At the school yesterday, parents appeared to back the headmaster’s stance. One, a mother of three who requested not to be named, said: ‘It is not nice to leave people out. ‘I . usually invite the whole class until they have really made close . friends, but when they are older you just ring the other mums.’ A . mother of eight-year-old twins said parents understood the rule. ‘We . just tell the children about the party outside of school. It would be . too many to invite the whole class.’ The . school, which costs £19,818 a year for boarders and up to £10,602 year . for day pupils, was opened by John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, in . 1748 for the sons of Methodist clergymen. It has 306 pupils aged three to 11 and ‘seeks to be a caring community based upon Christian principles’.","In letter, headteacher Mark Brearey said just inviting a few friends is 'divisive and unkind'

Hunter: Police believe Alois Huber, 55, is behind the attacks which have left four people dead . Police hunting a suspected poacher who shot dead three policemen and a paramedic in Austria have found a charred body inside the farmhouse where he was hiding, it emerged this morning. Alois Huber, 55, allegedly went on a killing spree on Tuesday before barricading himself inside a property near Melk, about 40 miles west of Vienna. Armed police commandos and army tanks surrounded the farmhouse before SWAT teams stormed the house and found the charred body, which they believe to be the gunman, after pushing through a wall into a smoke-filled hidden basement on the farm grounds. Regional police spokesman Roland Scherscher told reporters SWAT teams discovered the body after extinguishing a fire in the small cellar that was accessible only through a hidden door. He said the corpse was so badly burned that it was impossible to identify it but police assumed it was that of the gunman, who had been holed up on the farm grounds more than 24 hours before the charred remains were found. Police 'had to push against the wall to enter the room,' he said. And because 'the perpetrator could have been hiding behind each corner,' the search took more than four hours as police cautiously combed through the two story building, said Schercher. Police said final identification and cause of death would have to wait until forensic experts had finished their work. They said the assumption was that the suspect had laid the fire. The gunman had killed three police officers and a paramedic early on Tuesday morning before barricading himself in a farm building near Melk. During the 12-hour standoff, he shot sporadically at heavily armed police. Scroll down for video . Hideout: the alleged killer was hiding from officers in this house near Melk . The Krone tabloid quoted a friend of . the suspect as saying he had confessed in a telephone call from his home . as a police helicopter circled overhead and officers closed in. 'Unfortunately . it is true. I shot three policemen tonight,' the paper quoted the . conversation as related by the friend. 'I am the Annaberg poacher. They . shot me too, in the stomach. But it doesn't matter. 'I shot Burgi (his German shepherd dog) and they are not going to get me either.' The newspaper quoted the friend as saying the suspected gunman had confided two weeks ago that he was schizophrenic. Police said he fired the last shot about an hour before helmeted officers wearing body armor and toting assault rifles piled into three Austrian army tanks and moved in. More than 100 police officers cordoned off the area. Heavy armour: army tanks have been called in to protect officers from the man who was thought to have access to a high powered rifle capable of piercing bullet vests . Austrian army APCs discovered the body of a policeman in his car near the shooter's home . The killings began about 24 hours before the suspect barricaded himself, after police stopped the man on a road near a wilderness area west of Vienna where there has been frequent poaching. The gunman fled in his car, which landed in a ditch near the central Austrian town of Annaberg, then shot and wounded a member of Austria's Cobra SWAT team at a police checkpoint, said Interior Ministry spokesman Karl-Heinz Grundboeck. The police officer later died. An ambulance raced to the scene, but the gunman shot and killed its driver as he tried to give first aid to the wounded policeman. The gunman also shot and wounded another officer at the scene. Grundboeck said he was expected to recover. The attacker then fatally shot another police officer at a roadblock before barricading himself in the farm building. On the run: the suspect fled in his car before wrecking it and running the final distance on foot . Deadly: the driver of this ambulance was killed while trying to help a wounded officer . Later on Tuesday, another officer who had been missing was found shot dead in his patrol car near the farm, said Grundboeck. Scherscher said that officer was apparently killed after the suspect carjacked the police vehicle and took him hostage. Scherscher said he could not confirm an Austrian media report that the suspect was shot in the abdomen by police before he sought refuge inside the farm building. The provincial government of Lower Austria ordered black flags flown from all public buildings in honor of the victims. Violent . crime is rare in Austria, but hunting is a centuries-old tradition in . the Alpine republic enjoyed by tens of thousands, many of them farmers . and landowners. The attacks happened after officers tried to stop the man following reports he had been hunting illegally . Shootings: police vehicles have been riddled with bullets after the hunter opened fire in Annaberg .

This is essential when going out with your pet in public places.' Denise Elphick, co-founder of PetsPyjamas said: ‘Always take your dog for a walk before you go out to a restaurant so that they’re calm and well behaved when asked to sit for an extended period of time. ‘My most important tip is to ensure that your dog sits under the table, not under diners' feet. And you don’t to want to trip anyone up with long dog leads. Take a dog toy and a collapsible dog bowl.’ Rod Harris from Hurlingham added: ‘When out dining with your pet the key thing is to respect other people. ‘If you’re a good dog owner you’ll keep your pet well groomed as this is essential. Also never take a wet pet to a restaurant. They’ll be wet and smelly giving off D.O. (dog odour) which isn’t pleasant for fellow diners.’ The Olde Bell, Hurley, Berkshire .

Boris Johnson took a swipe at George Osborne’s plans for visa reform yesterday – as the potential Tory leadership rivals went head to head in China. The London Mayor, whose aides are irritated by Mr Osborne’s presence on the trip, suggested that an overhaul of Chinese visas does not go far enough. In the first part of a week-long charm offensive, the Chancellor announced plans to fast-track the visa system for wealthy Chinese tourists and businessmen. Mayor of London Boris Johnson (right) said George Osborne's (left) plans for Chinese visa reforms is 'unclear' But Mr Johnson, who has campaigned for a much more liberal regime, said: ‘We will have to see how this scheme actually works. The detail is a little bit unclear to us at the moment.’ Mr Johnson yesterday went out of his way . to steal the limelight from the Chancellor, with a series of florid . speeches and interviews. His bid to win over students at Peking University misfired slightly when he joked that Harry Potter’s first kiss with Chinese Hogwarts pupil Cho Chang illustrated the future for China and the UK. But critics pointed out that Cho Chang is thought to have been Scottish and the relationship quickly fizzled out. Mr Johnson insisted he and the Chancellor were like ‘a pair of harmonious doves’. Mr Osborne, whose speech was received in near silence, replied they were like the ‘yin and yang’ of politics. But behind the scenes there is some . resentment in the Mayor’s camp at the Chancellor’s decision to time his . visit to China to coincide with Mr Johnson’s. The two Tories are in China at the same time and Mr Johnson went out of his way to steal the limelight from the Chancellor . Mr Johnson insisted he and the Chancellor (pictured together at Peking University) were like a pair of 'harmonious doves', whereas Mr Osborne said they were the 'yin and yang' of politics . Chinese banks will be able to apply to set up wholesale branches in the City of London under plans announced by George Osborne. The Chancellor described the move, agreed with China after two days of talks, as 'good for UK jobs and investment'. The Prudential Regulation Authority will enter discussions with Chinese banks in London which will allow them to apply to set up wholesale banks in the UK. Chinese banks will not be able to open high street branches under the plans but will be able to conduct business with other banks and companies.The agreement also contains plans to cement London's position as the global hub for trading in the Chinese currency renminbi (RMB) by giving investors the chance to invest RMB directly into China through London under a pilot scheme. Mr Osborne said: 'A great nation like China should have a great global currency. 'Today we agreed the next big step in making London - already the global centre for finance - a major global centre for trading and now investing the Chinese currency too. 'More trade and more investment, means more business and more jobs for Britain.' The Mayor had hoped to . be the first senior British politician to visit China following a recent . thaw in relations, which had been in the deep freeze since David . Cameron met the Dalai Lama last year. But Mr Osborne then announced he would . visit China at the same time - a move which some in the Johnson camp . view as a ‘spoiler’. Both men yesterday faced criticism for failing to raise China’s abysmal human rights record with communist party officials. Amnesty International described the pair’s attitude to China’s human rights record on their visits as ‘disappointing’. Allan . Hogarth, of Amnesty UK, said: ‘We are very concerned about continued . use of the death penalty in China, police torture and harassment of . human rights and political activists and minority groups, and . restrictions on freedom of expression.’ Mr Osborne said the purpose of . the trip was to strengthen trade relations with the emerging economic . superpower. He said Britain should show more respect for China and stop treating the country like a ‘sweatshop on the Pearl River’. He added that there was ‘no limit on the amount of business we can do together.’ Meanwhile, . the Mayor said it was not his role to challenge China on human rights . adding: ‘I don’t walk into a meeting and say, “I say, you chaps, how’s . freedom doing?” ’ 'I’m not . saying there isn’t a role for the British government to stand up for . what is right in the world, or what the British government sees as being . right. 'All I’m saying is . it’s not really my core function as Mayor of London to go around . aggrandising myself in that way and presuming to take on all the pomp . and panoply of foreign secretary and international relations and all the . rest of it.’ However Mr Johnson's attempt to sell . Britain's relationship with China mis-fired with a Harry Potter . analogy which lacked magic. The . London Mayor is in Beijing talking up closer links with China, claiming . it was like the wizard's first girlfriend 'Cho Chang - who is a Chinese . overseas student at Hogwarts school'. But . the latest attempt to upstage Mr Osborne quickly unravelled, with fans of the JK Rowling . series pointing out that Cho Chang was British, and their relationship . fell apart soon after starting. Both men have been criticised for failing to raise China's poor human rights record during their trip . Highlighting Britain's close relationship with China, Mr Johnson drew on the literary works of JK Rowling. Speaking at a Q&A session at . Peking University, he said: 'If you want one final proof of how fast the . world is changing, the cultural interpenetration between Britain and . China, let me ask you a question, brilliant students of Peking . University. 'Who in English . literature is the most famous student? Who is the most famous student . in contemporary British writing, would you say? I will give you a clue - . he sometimes has a wand... Harry Potter.' He . went on: 'Where does the train go from which Harry Potter has to catch . to go to his school? King's Cross, absolutely right, which is where? London. 'Where does Harry Potter buy his . uniform and his wand and stuff like that and his books? I think it's in . Diagon Alley which is in London. Where is the location of the Ministry . of Magic? London. 'And who . according to JK Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter novels, was . Harry Potter's first girlfriend? Who is the first person he kisses? That's right, Cho Chang - who is a Chinese overseas student at Hogwarts . school. 'Ladies and gents I rest my case. I don't think I need to argue any further, that is the future of Britain and of London.' However, . it was quickly noted that Cho Chang was not described as a Chinese . overseas student in the series of novels, and was played in the films by . British-Asian actress Katie Leung with a Scottish accent.","Boris Johnson suggested George Osborne's plans do not go far enough .

People earning £60,000 a year might not feel ‘particularly rich’ and should not be targeted by tax increases, said shadow Treasury chief secretary Rachel Reeves, who earns an MP's salary of £66,396 a year. She insisted Labour had ‘no plans or desire’ to increase taxes for people in that income bracket, but instead the focus would be on the ‘privileged few’ at the very top of the income scale. Ms Reeves also indicated a Labour government would ensure that the national minimum wage would rise to keep pace with prices and average earnings as the party looks set to put cost of living issues at the centre of its election campaign. Creditworthy? Ex Bank of England employee Rachel Reeves MP said those on £60,000 a year aren't rich . Ms Reeves told The Daily Telegraph: ‘I'm not going to make promises about individual tax rates, but we've shown which side we're on. Our manifesto will reflect those priorities.’ But she added: ‘The focus should be on a privileged few right at the top, and that's not people earning £50,000 or £60,000 a year. 'If you're a single-earner family in the South East on (that income), you don't feel particularly rich, and you'd be aggrieved that people earning between £150,000 and £1 million are getting a tax cut. ‘We don't have any plans or desire to increase tax on people in that band of income.’ The Liberal Democrats were forced to play down suggestions that people earning more than £50,000 would be ‘clobbered’ with tax rises after a briefing to MPs during their party conference suggested the figure. Enforcing the minimum wage and ensuring it rises in line with the cost of living look set to be part of the party's election pitch to voters, Ms Reeves indicated. ‘If it had kept pace with the FTSE 100 top pay, it would be worth almost £19 an hour,’ she said. ‘Making sure that it keeps pace with prices and average earnings will be part of our offer at the next election.’ There will be ‘more prosecutions’ and ‘employers need to know they can't get away with paying less than the minimum wage’, she added. Ms Reeves was recently branded 'boring, snoring' on Twitter by Ian Katz, the editor of Newsnight. The MP said the comment made her feel 'humiliated and frustrated' and Ian Katz was forced to issue a series of humbling public apologies.

Sylvia and Kelvin Rostron attacked a boy and a girl both aged under 16 over a number of years in east Lancashire, the jury was told. One alleged victim claimed Mr Rostron, 70, would come into her room on school nights while everybody else was asleep and wake her up before cuddling and sexually assaulting her. 'Indecent assault': Kelvin Rostron, 70, (left) and his wife Sylia, 65, (right) attacked a boy and a girl aged under 16 'over a number of years' during the 1960s and 1970s, the jury at Burnley Crown Court was told . She finally decided to go to the police after telling a former worker at the home she had been abused when they bumped into each other again by chance years later, Burnley Crown Court heard. Kevin Donnelly, prosecuting, said: 'She felt dirty and horrible about herself. It would make her cry. 'She said that she had been frightened and had not known what to do. She had never been able to look at herself in the mirror. 'She believed that Sylvia knew about her husband’s abuse of her. She had regularly run away from home as a result of the abuse that she was suffering.' The court was told that one woman, who had lived in the homes at the same time as the alleged victims, remembered Mr Rostron being ‘more tactile’ with the girls in the house, rather than the boys. Mr Donnelly added: 'Mr Rostron is a man who had been very tactile with the girls in the home. 'He would commonly pick them up and tickle them. Abuse claims: The couple, seen outside Burnley Crown Court, attacked two children in east Lancashire during the 1960s and 70s, it is claimed .

Rising up: Carole, pictured after visiting her grandson George for the first time at St Mary's Hospital in London, has long been seen to have aristocratic aspirations . The agonies of how to design a new family coat of arms is one no doubt familiar to every aspirational family. So it can come as no surprise that faced with such a challenge the astute former air stewardess Carole Middleton - mother of the Duchess of Cambridge - sought the advice of those valued by other great British families - even those that don't actually exist. Downton Abbey has been revealed as the unlikely source of inspiration as the socially mobile Mrs Middleton set out to design her family crest in the run up to the 2011 royal wedding. The family even went to Highclere Castle, the set for ITV's award winning period drama, to meet etiquette expert historian Alastair Bruce who advises the show on social protocol. They were so delighted by the royal equerry's knowledge they asked him for help with the design of their own crest which was later used to adorn the programme at the Royal Wedding in April 2011. Mr Bruce, 53, is an expert on protocol and advises the actors and production team on the set of the show to make sure every aspect of every scene is historically accurate. Affectionately nicknamed the Oracle he has been known to stop filming because he spotted that the 'wrong' shoebrush was being used to shine some boots and is often found pacing the length of the Downton dining room adjusting cutlery and pleading with actors to keep their hands off the table. A source told The Sun: 'Alastair is also a Queen's Herald, so he has a lot of experience. 'But I'm sure people will be amused to know the Middletons looked to Downton Abbey for help in coming up with the coat of arms.' Although as a royal bride Kate would have been entitled to apply for a heraldic design in her own right, it was decided that her parents would commission one. How it might have been: Had she been without the help of her aristocratic advisors this is how the Middleton crest might have turned out . A high-class line-up: The cast of the popular show Downton Abbey . Painstaking process: After much discussion about the design Herald Painter Robert Parsons, sketches the Coat of Arms for the Middleton family . Coats of Arms came into being during medieval tournaments like jousting when knights would be recognised by the motifs on their shields or helmets and heralds quickly learnt the different ones in use, taking up responsibility for the control of their use.Over time their use began to decline in competition and battle but they became more widely used in society.The College of Arms, a branch of the Royal household, is the official body in the UK that deals with coats of arms and their team of experts - funded by the fees they charge and not taxpayers money - design and research heraldic or genealogical issues.The arms are given for free while the money people pay is for the research and design of the coat of arms.However, that doesn't mean that just anybody can pay the fee and get a coat of arms. The cumulative knowledge of the Earl Marshal gathered over hundreds of years has given them the skill of tactfully suggesting that people don't proceed with their application.The late Peter Gwynn-Jones, a former Garter King of Arms, once said: 'In practice, eligibility depends upon holding a civil or military commission, a sound university degree or professional qualification, or having achieved some measure of distinction in a field beneficial to society as a whole.' This gives his entire family – including their other children, Pippa, 30, and James, 26, the right to use the emblem. They met with Mr Bruce and his colleague Thomas Woodcock the College of Arms Garter Principle King of Arms and Senior Herald to invent their crest. Together they settled on a simple design, with three leafy acorns representing each of the couple’s three children – an idea suggested by Kate herself. Acorns were chosen for the analogy that they grow into great oaks. Oak is also a symbol of England and strength, and West Berkshire, where the children were brought up, has many oak trees. Most eye-catching is the gold chevron in the centre of the design representing Kate’s mother, Carole, at the heart of her family with the colour a subtle reference to her maiden name, Goldsmith. The two thin white chevronels on either side allude to mountains and the family’s love of skiing and outdoor pursuits. The background colours of red and blue were chosen as they are the principle colours from the flag of the United Kingdom and match Prince William’s recently revised coat of arms. The College of Arms also likes to include a pun wherever possible and has made the two colours meet squarely in the centre as a play on the words ‘middle tone’. But while Kate's brother James will be able to pass down the coat of arms to his children Pippa, as a woman, will not and can only use it during her lifetime. Yesterday a spokesman for Downton Abbey confirmed: 'Alastair worked with the Garter Principal King of Arms on developing the Middleton crest.'

"By . Lucy Waterlow . PUBLISHED: . 03:34 EST, 15 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:02 EST, 15 October 2013 . When author Jane Yeadon recalls her nursing days in the Sixties, she speaks of the 'fun and companionship' she shared with her colleagues and happy days spent bonding with the community as she carried out her daily duties. It seems a far cry from the experiences of nurses today who often work long and stressful hours. Jane, now 69 and living with her husband in Forres, trained as a midwife in Belfast before qualifying as a Queen's . Nurse in Edinburgh, and then worked as a district nurse in the . Scottish Highlands. Times have changed: Jane Yeadon says she may well not have chosen to be a nurse if she was starting out on her career today . She told MailOnline she loved her job but if she was starting out on her career today, she's not sure she would have chosen nursing. 'When I was young, there weren't as many careers for women to chose from,' she said. 'I started training to be a nurse when I was 17 but it was very different then to how it is today. Things have radically changed. Now it's much more academic and they have longer working hours, I'm not sure how girls do it today.' The differences seem most striking - for both patients and staff - when comparing how maternity wards operate today compared to in the Sixties. Jane with her nursing colleague: She said they shared great fun and companionship despite facing some challenging moments through their work . Jane explains: 'Today women have a baby and are often discharged within a day or two. Before, they would stay in hospital for six days - ten if they'd had a caesarean. It gave the anxious new mothers the chance to develop their confidence with the support of experts. 'Cleanliness is a basic thing but hospitals seem to have been prettied up with things like carpets today' 'Today the maternity wards are more like factories, there isn't time or staff available to support mothers staying for longer.' She also believes it's harder for new mothers to find support from their communities today because everyone leads busy lifestyles and many aren't friendly with their neighbours. Jane wonders if more mothers would choose home births today if there were more midwives available to help them. In the past, as portrayed in the TV show Call The Midwife, she and her colleagues would cycle to the homes of mothers-to-be to help deliver their babies - with all the equipment they needed in a basket on their bicycles. BBC's Call the Midwife: The author has written her own memoirs of her time as a midwife and said she can relate to the show based on the book by Jennifer Worth . Real deal: Jane, far left, lived through the times Call The Midwife portrays . She said: 'We used to cycle everywhere and that did make us feel part of the community and gave us a chance to speak to people. Sex education wasn't as good then though, the children I spoke to used to think we were delivering the babies to the new mothers in our baskets!' Of the BBC show, based on the experiences of midwife Jennifer Worth in the Fifties, Jane said she can 'relate to a lot of it although some scenes have obviously been modified to be more entertaining than reality'. Home births were commonplace in the Fifties and one in three newborns were delivered in British homes in the Sixties. By the Seventies, the majority were on labour wards after the Peel Report recommended that all births should be carried out in hospitals. Today the number of women booking to have a home birth is rising but the service is limited by some health authorities and only about 2.5 per cent of pregnant women in the UK choose this option. Jane said: 'Anyone who has had a home birth will tell you it's great but I expect there's not enough midwives today to provide the service.' Tellingly, when Jane had her own two children, who are now in their thirties, she chose a hospital birth. 'I suppose it's because of my job I knew all the worst case scenarios so I wanted to have full medical support,' she said. Sharing her memories: Now retired from her nursing duties, she has penned three memoirs of her experiences. The latest, Call Me Sister, right, is published this week . Jane wrote about her midwifery days in her memoirs 'It Won't Hurt a Bit!' and 'It Shouldn't Happen to a Midwife!' Her third memoir, 'Call Me Sister', published this month by Black & White Publishing, recalls her time training to be a district nurse in Scotland. She was faced with all manner of challenges, from . unwilling patients and life-threatening emergencies, to badly-behaved . dogs and runaway chickens, all with the 'back-up' of the . community she served. 'We weren't dressed for comfort. 'The uniforms were constricting so we were always having to hike up them up' When it comes to the hospital wards, Jane said 'cleanliness was God' in the Sixties and there were less instances of people contracting super bugs like MRSA. 'Cleanliness is a basic thing but hospitals seem to have been prettied up with things like carpets today. It's common sense you can't hose them down. 'I think standards were higher back then. If you were seen spending your time talking to a patient you were frogmarched off to clean instead, it was all very military. However the more experienced you got the less time you were expected to spend cleaning.' Jane said the nurses were all referred to by their surnames and their level of experience was denoted by the colour of their belt. She concedes that when it comes to uniform, nurses today have a better deal. In the Sixties they had to wear dresses and stockings with pillbox hats. 'We weren't dressed for comfort,' she said. 'The uniforms were constricting so we were always having to hike up them up so we could move around better - but we were then told off for our rising hemlines. We had to wear starched aprons - a new one every day that had been freshly laundered.' In the book, she recalls how the hats worn for nursing lacked style credentials and couldn't be worn at a trendy, jaunty angle. She writes: 'They only stayed in one position, were the same colour as our coats and defied any sort of creativity, unless you could do a fancy bow with the ties.'

A fighting bull bred to take on matadors escaped from his enclosure and gored a German cyclist to death, it emerged today. The horrific killing took place on Monday in beautiful countryside near Mejanes, in the Camargue region of southern France. The 54-year-old cyclist, who has not been named, was riding with his 47-year-old wife on a quiet road near an estate owned by the Paul Ricard liquor company. Horrifying: A fighting bull bred to take on matadors escaped from his enclosure and gored a German cyclist to death, it emerged today (file photo) As they passed an enclosure full of bulls, one weighing around 350kg escaped through a broken fence and attacked them. ‘The bulls had been fighting among themselves, and that’s how their fence was broken,’ said a local police spokesman. ‘The victim was charged and then gored in the chest,’ added the spokesman, who said the man was rushed to hospital in nearby Arles but died of his injuries. Although accidents of this kind are extremely rare, they always lead to further calls for bullfighting to be banned. While Spain is the bullfighting centre of Europe, it is also very common in the south west of France. A 1951 law banned cruelty to animals in the country, but there are exceptions for towns with a long tradition of bullfighting and cockfighting.","Horrific killing took place on Monday near Mejanes, southern France .

There are said to have been at least four aftershocks measuring five on the Richter scale. Cebu province, about 350 miles south of Manila, has a population of more than 2.6 million people. A university, a school and two shopping malls, public markets and many small buildings sustained damage in the quake. Several of those who died in Cebu were crushed to death in a stampede at a sports complex, where  people had gathered to collect regular government cash handouts, according to the provincial disaster council chief, Neil Sanchez. He said two other people were killed when part of a school collapsed on a car they were parked in, while four others died at a fish market that crumbled.

The earthquake also was deep below the surface, unlike the 6.9-magnitude one last year in waters near Negros Island, also in the central Philippines, that killed nearly 100 people. Regional military commander Lt Gen Roy Deveraturda said that he recalled soldiers from the holiday break to respond to the quake. He said it damaged the pier in Tagbilaran and caused some cracks at Cebu's international airport but that navy ships and air force planes could use alternative ports to help out. Passenger flights were put on hold until officials check runways and buildings for damage. Earthquakes are common in the Philippines, which lies along the Pacific 'Ring of Fire'. The deadliest recorded natural disaster in the Philippines occurred in 1976, when a tsunami triggered by a magnitude 7.9 earthquake devastated the Moro Gulf on the southern island of Mindanao. Between 5,000 and 8,000 people were killed, according to official estimates.","Buildings and roads were destroyed in the earthquake at 8.12am local time .

A toddler died in agony because of a 'very large number of serious failures' by medics who did not spot a fatal brain condition in time to save her, a coroner ruled today. Two-year-old Alice Mason died 'prematurely' after her illness went 'undiagnosed and untreated', an inquest at West London Coroner's Court heard. Coroner Sean Cummings apologised to the child's parents for Alice's 'avoidable' death and added, 'I am very very . sorry that you had to endure this.' 'Serious failures': Alice Mason, two, pictured, died after doctors repeatedly failed to spot a fatal brain condition, a coroner has ruled . Alice had successfully undergone treatment for a brain tumour two months before she was taken ill in March 2011. She died days later having developed fluid on the brain. In a narrative inquest verdict, the coroner stated: 'Alice’s death was avoidable'. He noted that Alice had died 'prematurely' at home on March 31 2011 from an illness which had gone 'undiagnosed and untreated'. He ruled 'there were a very large number of serious failures' in Alice’s care and he would be making a report to NHS London with a copy to the Care Quality Commission about the issue. The youngster’s care was shared between her family’s local district general hospital, Kingston Hospital in Surrey, cancer specialists at the Royal Marsden Hospital, in Chelsea, west London, and a neurosurgical team at St George’s Hospital, south London. Dr Cummings accepted there 'have been improvements in the main,' at the hospitals but added: 'What I continue to have concerns about is the ability of the consultants to effectively lead their teams.' Before bringing the inquest to a . close, Dr Cummings turned to Alice's parents Rosalind and Gareth Mason and said: 'I am very very . sorry that you had to endure this and it has gone on for such a long . time. 'You had Alice . taken away from you in such a circumstance that was hasty. A parent I . think you would want to be in a position where they can look after their . children right the way through to the end. 'I am sorry and you have my sincere condolences.' Illness: The inquest heard there had been failures 'at almost every pathway,' including unclear information about Alice's MRI scan, inadequate communication and lack of overall care plan . The inquest heard that Professor Martin Gore, medical director of the Royal Marsden, who led an inquiry into Alice’s care at the hospital and Kingston Hospital following her death, found more than a dozen failings by medical staff. Dr Cummings said the report had shown failures at 'almost every pathway' of care given to the toddler including unclear information about her MRI scan, inadequate communication, lack of overall care plan, lack of monitoring of her hydrocephalus - or 'water on the brain' - and a failure to listen to Alice’s parents. Prof Gore told the inquest Alice’s death had 'shaken many, many people within the organisation'. 'I don’t think anyone involved in this case will forget it,' he said. 'I certainly won’t.' The inquest heard that Alice's parents were told at the Royal Marsden on March 23, 2011 that an MRI scan had shown some signs of fluid accumulation and that their daughter should be taken to Kingston Hospital if her symptoms worsened for a CT scan. But by the time tests were carried out, Alice had suffered irreversible brain damage and emergency surgery could not save her. Responsible: Alice's care was split between Kingston Hospital in south London, pictured, the Royal Marsden Hospital in Chelsea and St George's Hospital in south London . Lawyers for the family claimed there were also further delays in transferring Alice to St George’s Hospital and in the surgery taking place. Alice’s parents Mr and Mrs Mason hugged after the coroner delivered his verdict. In a statement after the inquest, they said: 'Our daughter’s death at two years of age, which the coroner has today described as ‘avoidable’, has devastated us. 'She died in pain whilst under the care of medical professionals in whom we had placed our trust and who we were forced to beg to get her the help she needed. 'Expert evidence has made clear that if the doctors had done what they should, Alice would be with us today. 'The inquest has clearly shown that despite Alice being under the ‘shared care’ of three hospitals, these hospitals did not work together as they should. 'We are grateful that the inquest into Alice’s death has at last allowed us to hear from the medical staff involved in Alice’s care and heard how an abject failure of leadership led to our daughter’s untimely death. 'The evidence has been shocking and should cause concern for all those who are patients of shared care systems across the UK. Action: Rosalind and Gareth Mason, pictured, will 'continue to pursue legal action against those involved' their lawyer Nicola Wainwright has said . 'We would like to know what has been done and being done to ensure nothing like this ever happens to another family. 'We hope the serious concerns the coroner will now communicate to all parties, including the CQC and NHS London, will lead to a real change in the way care is provided to children in London and across the UK.' The Mason family, based in south west London, will 'continue to pursue legal action against those involved,' according to their lawyer Nicola Wainwright. She said: 'The evidence the coroner heard at the inquest has confirmed the numerous failings in Alice’s care. The lack of responsibility taken by the consultants and the complete lack of communication of vital information about Alice’s condition between and within teams was just astonishing.' The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust said in a statement: 'The Royal Marsden carried out both its own internal investigation and a joint investigation with Kingston and St George’s hospitals into the circumstances surrounding Alice’s death. 'A comprehensive action plan has been put in place to address the issues raised in these inquiries. We are constantly reviewing our systems and processes and will continue to do so in light of the Coroner’s findings.'","Alice Mason, 2, was taken ill in March 2011 and died from fluid on the brain .

A puppy which was forced to have his leg amputated after being found injured on a railroad track has been fitted with a prosthetic paw. Hudson, a young pit bull, was fitted with the 'blade runner' limb after his paw became infected thanks to the ordeal of being dumped by his previous owner. The man who dumped Hudson and two other puppies - one of which later died - was sentenced to six months in prison for animal cruelty. Recovery: Hudson the pit bull puppy is pictured running around using his artificial paw . Plight: Hudson was abandoned by the railroad tracks in Albany, New York in September last year . Technology: He has been fitted with a 'blade runner' paw which allows him to run around again . The three dogs were found on the tracks in Albany, New York by a railroad worker in September this year, according to WNYT. They were injured and starving having apparently been neglected before their abandonment, and one of the puppies was unable to survive the ordeal. Another dog, Pearl, lost two toes to infection, while Hudson had to have his rear left paw amputated. The puppy was adopted by the Nash family, and fitted with a prosthetic limb in November last year. However, he eventually outgrew the artificial paw, and last week had to be fitted with a new one made by a specialist manufacturer. Injury: The infection in Hudson's paw meant it had to be amputated so the illness did not spread . Replacement: Hudson was fitted with a prosthesis last November but has now grown out of it . Grateful: Hudson's new owner Richard Nash thanked well-wishers for their 'support and love' The new limb includes a flexible blade which allows the dog to run around in comfort without putting too much pressure on the stump of his leg. Derrick Campana, president of Animal Ortho Care based in Chantilly, Virginia, was so moved by Hudson's plight that he agreed to drive six hours to Albany and fit the new prosthesis himself. He also measured the dog for a new one, as the one-year-old is likely to grow more and therefore need a new paw. Callous: Anthony Walker was sentenced to six months in prison for abandoning Hudson . Found: Hudson was discovered along with two other dogs on this stretch of railroad track . Mr Campana did not charge the Nashes for the treatment, which would normally cost up to $700, saying: 'It's really nice to be able to see Hudson in person.' 'It means a lot to me and my family and I'm sure to Hudson,' owner Richard Nash told WNYT. 'The outpouring of support and love that people have for him is just amazing.' Anthony Walker, who abandoned the dogs on the tracks and also left four other pets in a freezing truck, served a six-month prison service earlier this year, and has been banned from owning animals.","Pit bull puppy found on the railroad tracks in Albany, New York last year .

All construction came to an abrupt halt at the new $1.2 billion San Francisco 49ers showcase stadium after a delivery truck driver was crushed early Monday by a bundle of rebar being unloaded from his truck. Police, firefighters and state workplace safety officials are investigating the Santa Clara, California incident, which was the second deadly workplace accident on the site in less than four months. The 61-year-old Vacaville, California resident was severely injured by the heavy mass of steel bars as an ambulance rushed him to a local hospital, where he died. Tragic: On the ground is the bundle of rebar that presumably rolled off a 61-year-old driver's truck as he delivered it to the new San Francisco 49ers stadium. He was rushed to the hospital and pronounced dead . ‘We are deeply saddened to confirm that the driver has passed away as a result of his injuries,’ spokesman Jonathan Harvey said. The man was an employee of Gerdau Ameristeel's Napa Reinforcing Steel facility, a subcontractor on Levi Stadium, said Gerdau Ameristeel spokeswoman Kimberly M. Selph. In a statement, the 49ers said their ‘sincerest thoughts and prayers are with the family, friends and co-workers affected by this tragedy.’ Again: The 61-year-old Vacaville man was the second worker to die at the Santa Clara site of the new $1.2 billion stadium . The Santa Clara stadium is replacing Candlestick park, which lies about 40 miles to the north. It will be known as Levi’s Stadium. Construction is slated to be finished in July, and crews have been working in high gear to meet that deadline. Officials say the accelerated work plan involves a highly coordinated scheme to maximize efficiency and avoid delays. Construction firm investigators also were on-scene Monday, to see what could have been done to prevent what is now the second deadly accident at the site.

Actor Sir Derek Jacobi has said that traditional Shakespeare performances where lines are recited like poetry 'send me to sleep'. The 74-year-old said that the plays should be delivered in the way that a character 'thinks, feels and speaks'. Speaking at the close of the Cheltenham Literature Festival, Sir Derek said actors should be looking to ensure that the audience understands. Delivery: Sir Derek Jacobi, seen here on stage performing in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, said that actors should deliver lines clearly rather than reciting them like poetry . Performer: Sir Derek Jacobi who has appeared in Henry V, Gladiator, Gosford Park and the King's Speech . He joked that the old-fashioned . approach of focusing on the rhythm of each line 'enhances my ignorance . of what they're saying', the Daily Telegraph reported. Sir Derek is an acclaimed theatre actor but has appeared on screen in Henry V, Gladiator, Gosford Park and the King's Speech. In the past he has claimed that William Shakespeare's plays were in fact written by Edward de Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford. He claimed the Earl hid behind the Bard because a nobleman could not be seen as a common playwright. He said: 'The simple fact is the earl could not be seen as a common playwright. He was living in a Stasi-type London,' he said. Addressing . the literature festival, Sir Derek said actors should ignore the . punctuation in Shakespeare's plays and read the lines normally and . naturally. He said that actors need to show 'a healthy disrespect for punctuation'. He added: 'Go for the meaning, that meaning that will ricochet round the auditorium. 'They . will then not have that fear that a lot of audiences have, sitting . there thinking I don't understand this.

The images have fueled concern that China has discovered a way of cloning the military hardware. It has already successfully cloned some of America's most advanced weapons systems, The Aviatonist reports. It is not clear when the pictures were taken, but they recently appeared on the China Defense Blog. In 2011, it was reportedly claimed that China was able to build its first stealth bomber using technology gleaned from a downed U.S. fighter. Beijing unveiled its state-of-the-art jet – the Chengdu J-20 – in April, 2011. At the time, military officials said it was likely the Chinese were able to develop the stealth technology from parts of an American F-117 Nighthawk that was shot down over Serbia in 1999. Other theories suggest that the helicopter is a full-size movie prop, or one of the U.S. Army Apaches downed or crash landed in Iraq, that was later fixed and exported in China.

Karen Cooper, 42, suffered the injury as she played with son Zac while on holiday in Mallorca. She noticed something was awry the next day when applying suncream to the area and it felt sore. Lucky diagnosis: Karen Cooper, 42, was hit in the chest with a ball as she played with her son Zac while on holiday in Mallorca. When the area was still sore a few days later, she saw a doctor who detected a lump . Worried, she saw a doctor as soon as she returned home to Manchester. She said: 'When I went to the doctor, there was a little lump there - but I was told it wouldn't be anything serious.' But tests and a biopsy later revealed that she had aggressive stage three cancer, which can be life-threatening. Mrs Cooper said:' I just feel so lucky that Zac hit me in the chest with the ball, or I wouldn't have noticed [the lump]. I didn't feel ill and wasn't in any pain.' She added that Zac, 15, had been worried he had caused the cancer. Mrs Cooper said: 'At first he thought that he had caused it, so we had to reassure him. He was shocked and upset but we told him that he had found it for me. He saved my life, definitely' The mother-of-two said: 'At first he . thought that he had caused it, so we had to reassure him. He was shocked . and upset but we told him that he had found it for me. He saved my life, definitely.' Cancer Research UK says that physical injury of a breast is unlikely to result in cancer. Instead, because the area is sore or injured, the breast itself is being examined and followed . more closely than usual, and that is why breast cancer is detected, . rather than it being due to the actual injury. After 15 sessions of radiotherapy, she has been told the cancer is no longer present - and is now fundraising for cancer charities . Mrs Cooper's treatment began in September 2010 with six rounds of chemotherapy at The Christie hospital in Manchester, which specialises in cancer treatments. She then underwent surgery to have the lump from her breast and the surrounding lymph nodes removed. In April 2011, after 15 sessions of radiotherapy, she was told the cancer was no longer present - and says she is healthy again despite having weaker muscles. Despite this, she ran a Cancer Research Race for Life this summer. Just five years before, she had run the same race in aid of a colleague who lost a battle with cancer. Mrs Cooper said: 'It felt strange doing it again after my cancer, but it was a great experience and I raised £282.' She added that living through breast cancer had been a terrifying experience, but that her husband Darren and two children Zac and Kayley, 23, were very supportive. She said: 'When it was confirmed I had cancer, I was just so frightened. But I was determined to beat it and I just kept positive. 'I was also really lucky to have such fantastic friends and family who supported me throughout.' Generally, doctors don't believe that an injury to the breast can lead to cancer, according to Cancer Research UK. An . injury can cause fibrous scar tissue to form and this may be mistaken . for cancer. Or inflammation may make a breast lump that is already there . more obvious. Some women wonder if a past injury could have caused . their breast cancer. One study by scientists at the University of Lancaster found that physical trauma (a blow to the breast area) could cause breast cancer. However, other experts contest that because of trauma to the breast, the breast itself is being examined and followed more closely than usual, and that is why breast cancer is detected, rather than it being due to the actual injury. Experts add that cancers are fundamentally caused by faulty or damaged genes and take a very long time to develop, and it's much more likely that injuries draw attention to tumours that are already there.","Karen Cooper was playing ball with son Zac, 15, in Mallorca .

"By . Martin Robinson . PUBLISHED: . 06:57 EST, 15 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:14 EST, 15 October 2013 . The heartbroken parents of a stillborn baby who died after a series of blunders had to grieve on a packed maternity ward because the hospital's bereavement suite was being used for storage. Kerry Watson, 28, had to endure the torment of delivering her lifeless child Cameron naturally after hospital staff ignored a scan which revealed he was being starved of oxygen in the womb. A review into maternity services within Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust has now revealed that if he had been delivered just one day earlier by emergency caesarean, he would have survived. Scandal: Kerry Watson, 28, had to endure the torment of delivering her lifeless child Cameron at Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield and then grieve surrounded by other mothers . Appallingly, Kerry and husband Craig, 27, were then left to recover on a ward alongside new mums because the bereavement suite was being used to store records - something the report describes as 'almost beyond belief'. Kerry, who also has an eight-year-old son, said: 'I was in labour for 24 hours and for most of this time, we were left alone. I felt that the staff didn't want to face us and we were totally unsupported through the process. 'This was the most horrendous experience of my life but to top it off, midwives said the only place available for me to recover was on the ward with all the new mums. 'There was no way I could do it so we were sent home.' The couple of Normanton, West Yorkshire, had struggled to conceive so were 'overjoyed' when they found out she was pregnant with their second child. But she started suffering pains on Boxing Day 2011 and visited Pinderfields Hospital having not felt the baby move for some time. Damning: A review of care at Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust found if Cameron had been delivered a day earlier he would have survived . Staff carried out tests but put it down to Cameron being a sleepy baby, despite Kerry pointing out the fact he had always been very active. By 3 January 2012 Kerry was still concerned so she and Craig went back to hospital - and only a faint heartbeat was detected. However, as Cameron had not met the essential criteria on the monitor, Kerry was referred through to the Consultant - who failed to check the results that had been printed from the monitor and instead told the couple to return the following day. Ms Watson said: 'After a student midwife and a senior midwife could not find a heartbeat, a doctor eventually came in and placed a scanner on my stomach and turned the screen to face us. 'It was obvious our son's heart was not beating. We asked whether our son was alive but no one would answer and a radiographer was then called in. 'She took pictures on the scanner for five minutes. We were totally distraught by this point and finally she said, ""I'm sorry, he's gone"". 'We were in complete and utter disbelief. We had known for days that something wasn't right but hospital staff made us feel that we were being a nuisance and tried to brush it all under the carpet. 'It just breaks my heart to know that if Cameron had been delivered by caesarean or even the day before when we saw the consultant, he'd still be alive today but instead we felt we were ignored and dismissed because we were blocking up the Consultant's clinic, which was the first clinic back after New Year.' A review into maternity services within Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust following Cameron's death revealed concerns about staff's professional behaviour after a consultant was described as being unprofessional and rude in his approach with Kerry and Craig. It also found that midwives were afraid to question the consultant's decisions when it was apparent the patient could be in danger and there was inadequate documentation. There was inadequate assessment of clinical information and although a fetal heart scan identified Cameron's heartbeat as weak, it was not acted upon. Finally, the investigation revealed a lack of skills in managing bereaved families and a lack of bereavement facilities. The couple are speaking out for the first time after experts at Irwin Mitchell secured an admission of liability from Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust. The consultant is now being investigated by the General Medical Council (GMC) and has restrictions on his practice. Anna Bosley, a specialist medical lawyer at Irwin Mitchell's Leeds office who represents Kerry and Craig said: 'This couple has been devastated by the loss of their son Cameron and they understandably wanted answers about what went  wrong. 'Whilst we welcome the fact that the Trust has admitted responsibility, we back the couple's calls for proof from the trust that improvements have been made to maternity services to protect patient safety and prevent the same catalogue of failings being made again.' Dr Richard Jenkins, medical doctor at Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust, apologised and said they recognised failings in care. 'We started an investigation immediately after these events with input from an independent clinician and we have already implemented changes as a result. 'While sadly we cannot change the outcome for Cameron, we believe the steps we have taken will minimise the risk of a similar tragedy occurring in the future.'","Review of care at Pinderfields Hospital reveals series of failures by staff .

Lawyers defending James Holmes, who is accused of killing 12 and injuring 70 in a Colorado theatre shooting, will argue his conversations with police immediately afterwards cannot be used as evidence. In today's hearing, Holmes' defense will argue that police did not read him the Miranda rights informing him that anything he says may be used in evidence against him. The prosecution will argue that their question to Holmes before they read him the Miranda rights was legal under a public-safety exemption. Police say they asked him if he had an accomplice, according to Fox News. Holmes is charged with killing 12 people and wounding 58 when he opened fire at a Dark Knight Rises screening in the Denver suburb of Aurora last July . Holmes pleaded not guilty by reason of . insanity for the mass murders in a crowded Aurora movie theater during a . midnight show on July 20, 2012. He faces 166 counts, including murder . and attempted murder. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. It is the second week of hearings focused on what evidence will be submitted in Holmes' trial. Some of the evidence in dispute comes from two dating websites where Holmes set up accounts before the shootings. Prosecutors . say that in his website profiles on Match.com and . AdultFriendFinder.com, Holmes asked, 'Will you visit me in prison?' Prosecutors say they plan to use that to show Holmes knew the shootings were wrong, undercutting his insanity plea. According . to the judge's summary of the arguments, Holmes' created the Match.com . account in April 2012 and the AdultFriendFinder.com account just 15 days . before the shooting on July 20. Both were last accessed two days before . the shooting. Evidence? James Holmes created a profile on a popular sex website just days before the massacre . Photos posted . to both accounts showed Holmes with the orange-dyed hair made infamous . in his first court appearance after the shooting. The titles associated with Holmes' postings on both sites were, 'Will you visit me in prison?' Holmes . created the profile on AdultFriendFinder.com on July 5, just two weeks . before the shooting and included a picture of himself with reddish, . orange hair. Holmes, who . used the screen name classicjimbo included a cryptic message on the top . of the profile which read, 'Will you visit me in prison?' In his profile, he described himself as 6ft and single with an athletic body. He . said he was a 'light/social drinker', however in the section where he's . asked if he smokes or does drugs, he answered, 'I'd prefer not to say.' He also states his penis size as 'short/average'. Clean-shaven James Holmes in a court sketch from Sept 30, left, and bearded at an earlier hearing (right) 'A . reasonable inference may be drawn that the user of the accounts posted . the question because he anticipated doing something that he was aware . would warrant prison time,' Arapahoe County District Judge Carlos . Samour's wrote. The judge . also wrote that evidence from both dating sites could be used in the . trial in relation to the identification, sanity, intent, deliberation . and culpable mental state of the suspect. Samour . overruled several distinct objections defense attorneys made in their . attempt to have this evidence barred. That included objections about . online dating posts' relevance, timing and the direct connection to the . suspect. The judge has already rejected one defense attempt to suppress the website evidence. Bargaining: The evidence against Holmes is so strong he may accept a plea agreement before trial . Lawyers . for the accused have challenged the admissibility of . almost all the key evidence in the case — from photos found on Holmes' iPhone to explosives seized in his apartment to statements he made to . police after his arrest. Defense . attorneys argue that investigators seized the evidence without . establishing a proper legal foundation, initially entered Holmes' apartment without a warrant and questioned Holmes after he asked for an . attorney. Prosecutors . contend the evidence was seized properly and that their methods were . justified by ongoing fears for the public's safety even after Holmes was . arrested.

An autopsy report has revealed that a popular Miami radio personality died of a bacterial infection related to cosmetic surgery. Betty Pino, 65, underwent surgery in June to remove silicone that had been injected into her buttocks four years earlier. She died on August 7 after being admitted . to hospital with sepsis caused by a bacterial infection. In the days . before her death the infection had spread and doctors amputated her . hands and feet. Beloved voice: Radio announcer Betty Pino in February this year . According to the Miami Herald, the . autopsy report states that Pino had received 'hard' implants in her . buttocks 20 years earlier. A decade later, she had them removed and replaced with saline implants, which caused her pain when she sat down. Four years ago Pino had the saline implants removed and had silicone injected into her buttocks. 'Over . time the tissue in the buttocks hardened and deformed, causing pain,' states the 17-page autopsy report obtained by El Nuevo Herald. It is illegal to inject silicone into the buttocks in the United States due to the likelihood of serious complications. The . silicone can harden and cause chronic inflammation, or drift and spread . down the legs. It can also cause blood clots and infection. Deaths . from black-market buttocks injections have been reported in Alabama, . Georgia, Florida, Pennsylvania, Nevada and New York and despite a lack . of official data due to the back-room nature of the procedure, there is . anecdotal evidence it's becoming more common. The . Miami Herald reports that Pino sought out a doctor to remove the . silicone but could not find a one who would perform the operation for . fear of the risk of complication. Finally, she found Coconut Grove surgeon Dr Constantino Mendieta, a buttocks reconstruction specialist who is certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery. He operated on Pino on June 14 and she went home that same day. Following her surgery, Pino's surgical wounds became infected. Music lover: Pino, seen here in the studio with singer Willy Chirino, is credited with helping to launch the careers of many Latin artists . Glamorous: Betty Pino (right) was known for her youthful looks . 'She was admitted to the hospital with sepsis due to infection of her surgical wounds, and after a period of hospitalization with multiple medical and surgical complications, she died,' states the autopsy report. Pino fell into a coma on July 17 and developed septic shock and a huge infection. Doctors amputated her hands and feet on August 6. The following day, Pino's family elected to switch off her life-support machines and she passed away at Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital. 'At the end she did not suffer. We were responsible for disconnecting her and that’s what we did,' Jorge Gaviria, a close friend of Pino’s, told the Miami Herald. Distinguished career: Ecuadorian-born Pino (center) began her radio career began in 1973 . The Miami Herald reports that Dr Mendieta refutes the findings of the autopsy. According to Mendieta, Pino did not die from complications relating to his operation but from the illegal buttock implants she received. Ecuadorian-born Pino was host of a weekly show on Univision’s Amor 107.5 FM . Miami where she played the latest hit songs. She was referred to in the Latin community as the 'Queen of radio' and counted stars including Julio Iglesias, Gloria Estefan and Shakira among her friends. Pino worked as a maid in a hotel when she first arrived in the U.S., eventually becoming a receptionist at a radio station before beginning her on-air career in 1974 on the now-defunct FM-92. The Spanish-language announcer was known for her youthful, surgically-enhanced looks. It is not known who gave Pino the silicone buttocks injections that eventually led to her demise. Miami-Dade detectives say Pino's death remains under investigation.","Miami radio announcer Betty Pino, 65, died in August .

She is the model of the moment, with millions of girls worldwide desperate to emulate her distinct look. And now, celebrity make-up artist Lisa Eldridge has revealed exactly how to recreate Cara Delevingne's model make-up at home. Lisa was inundated with requests asking her to re-create the look she gave Cara at a recent party, so she has shared her step-by-step guide, favourite products and hints and tips exclusively with FEMAIL. Get the look: Lisa says she was inundated with requests for the beauty look she gave Cara at a recent party so decided to create a video tutorial . 'I've done Cara's make-up lots of times and I love working with her, she's really polite, super intelligent and a lot of fun, so I really like doing her make-up. 'But I had so many requests for this one particular look that I did on her for a party recently. It's a nice make-up look, it can work on lots of different skin tones and faces. It's not about looking like Cara but more about recreating the look for yourself at home,' said Lisa. In her tutorial, she suggests starting with L'Oreal Infallible Foundation in Golden Beige. 'Put a really nice thin layer all over using a big fat buffing brush to really buff the product out. 'Use a clean brush, that way you get to spread the foundation without building up more and more of the product,' she explains. She then applies Nars Pro Prime Smudge Proof Eyeshadow Base to hold the eye make-up in place. 'Cara wore a silver suit to the party so I wanted a little bit in her make-up but without matching too much. 'So I used this metallic almost greeny, silvery grey Chanel Illusion d'Ombre Eye Shadow, which I applied fairly strongly all over Cara's eyelid to give a great metallic sheen,' she said. Silver fox: Lisa used lots of silver eyeshadow to match the suit Cara wore at the recent W magazine party . She then applied Maybelline New York Colour Tattoo 24hr Gel-Cream Eyeshadow in Charcoal to create more definition along Cara's socket line.

Tragedy: Daniel Kapis died walking to a wedding ceremony he had been invited to because he was lonely . A 'lonely man' who a couple invited to their wedding was knocked down and killed clutching the gift he bought them as he walked to their ceremony. Daniel Kapis, 64, from Canonsburg, in Washington County, Pennsylvania, was found on Route 19 in North Strabane on Friday, with the wedding card and a $25 gift certificate. Thomas and Denise Yakopin had invited Mr Kapis because he was extremely lonely and didn't have much in his life. They even requested that he shouldn't buy them a present because him just being there would have made them happy. According to the couple Mr Kapis had told them how excited he was to be attending their special day. But tragedy struck when Mr Kapis was walking to the church and he was knocked down by a passing vehicle. He died just before 5pm at Allegheny General Hospital. Speaking to the Pittsburgh News, Reverend John Batykefer said: 'When I found out it was him, it took me back and there was a gasp from the church when I made the announcement yesterday.' According to the priest, Mr Kapis was an usher at 10 o'clock mass every Sunday. 'From what I understand, he had the gift in his hand that they found at the scene of the accident.' The couple are said to be devastated by the news and on Saturday Mr Yakopin posted a tribute to Mr Kapis on his Facebook page. Scroll down for video .

Before he was admittedly trying to 'screw' his business partners out of the company they helped found, Twitter co-creator Jack Dorsey had a softer side - one in which he shared his feelings of love, loss, beauty and his affinity for Ani DiFranco in the form of poetry he posted on the Internet. As Twitter is about to become a publicly traded company - and Dorsey is poised to make hundreds of millions of dollars - his Internet poetry has long been erased from his personal website. But his web-based musings live on through a website called Archive.org. Much of the poetry and random streams of consciousness were posted to Dorsey's site about a decade ago, just a few short years before he and Twitter co-founders Evan Williams, Noah Glass and Biz Stone launched their uber-popular social media website. Dapper: Twitter founder has abandoned his teenage angst for fancy clothes and ruthless business tactics . Sensitive artist: Before 'screwing' his co-founders, Dorsey wrote sappy poetry and posted it on his personal website . Sensitive: In one of Dorsey's poems, he simply writes 'give me the courage to forget my...' On beauty, a far-more sensitive Dorsey than the man who forced Glass out of Twitter - after he was essential in bringing the site to fruition - laments, 'beautiful people, but none for me. I find my beauty behind broken key.' In a poem Dorsey entitled 'Find Yourself,' the conniving entrepreneur writes of inadequacy and his dissatisfaction of everyday life. 'Find yourself amongst the train yard where the freights bring the winds brings that rapidly approaching dust storm to your eyes sitting in the forgotten lazy-boy strewn over discarded liquor bottles. Can you please toot your horn for me?' he writes. 'Screwed': Dorsey admits that he tried to 'screw' business partners Evan Williams, Noah Glass and Biz Stone out of their share of credit for Twitter . Secretary: While Dorsey is expected to make hundreds of millions of dollars when Twitter goes public, Noah Glass is expected to make 'as much as Dorsey's secretary' The poem goes on to describe Dorsey's disconnect with a 9-5 lifestyle, before he concludes the piece with 'this is going nowhere and you're smacked into 5 oclock realization that neither are you.' In another rather cryptically titled nugget of Dorsian wisdom entitled 'Forget,' Dorsey leaves readers guessing with a simple, seven-word vignette. 'Give me the courage to forget my...' he writes. Dorsey's sensitive side doesn't appear to carry over into the business world, however, as it is being revealed that he is a ruthless corporate shark who abandoned his teenage angst and rebellious blue hair for cut-throat business dealings and Christian Dior dress shirts. In a scathing excerpt from the upcoming book Hatching Twitter: A True Story of Money, Power, Friendship and Betrayal that was published in the New York Times last week, author Nick Bilton tells the story of how Dorsey 'forced out the man who was arguably Twitter’s most influential co-founder before the site took off.' That man was Noah Glass, whom - when Twitter goes public - Bilton suspects will 'make about as much as Dorsey's secretary,' as Dorsey himself will make several hundred million dollars. Co-founder: Dorsey admits that he may have been trying to 'screw' over co-founder Evan Williams. Williams, however, still stands to make close to a billion dollars from Twitter . Besides the money, Bilton argues that Dorsey has re-written history in terms of how Twitter was started, and who should get the credit. 'In dozens of interviews, Dorsey completely erased Glass from any involvement in the genesis of the company,' Bilton writes. 'He changed his biography on Twitter to “inventor”; before long, he started to exclude Williams and Stone too. At an event, Dorsey complained to Barbara Walters that he had founded Twitter, a point she raised the next day on The View with Stone and Williams. Dorsey told The Los Angeles Times that “Twitter has been my life’s work in many senses.” He also failed to credit Glass for the company’s unusual name.' Of course, Bilton's narrative remains a far-cry from the Jack Dorsey who - less than a decade ago - wrote a poem he entitled JAKD, in which he wrote 'we'll give our creation to the first street dweller we stumble upon...remember to follow the rules.' Unless, of course, that street dweller is Noah Glass.","Dorsey's collegiate poetry has been deleted from his website, but lives on on the website archive.org .

A growing number of Mormons are pushing their church to relax its rules on homosexuality as families struggle to come to terms with teachings that conflict with their own situations. Wendy and Tom Montgomery became part of the group calling for acceptance after discovering that their teenage son is gay. 'It made me question everything,' Mrs Montgomery, who had campaigned against gay marriage in California in 2008, said. Scroll down for video . Campaign: Wendy Montgomery is calling for changes in the Mormon church after learning her son is gay . The 37-year-old mother is part of a group that is encouraging the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to teach homosexuality isn't a sin - and she is having some success. The Utah-based church has softened its stance on homosexuality since leading a multi-million dollar campaign over California's Proposition 8. A website started this year encourages more compassion toward gays, implores them to stay in the faith and clarifies that church leaders no longer 'necessarily advise' gays to marry people of the opposite sex in what used to be a widely practiced Mormon workaround for homosexuality. In May, church leaders backed the Boy Scouts' policy allowing gays in the ranks. Some gay Mormons who left or were forced out of the church say they are now being welcomed back - even though they remain in same-sex relationships. Nearly 400 members of the church have also taken part in Utah's gay pride march in Salt Lake City in the past two years. It may seem like negligible progress to outsiders, but Mormon scholars say 2013 has been a landmark year for the religion on gay and lesbian issues. 'For those who have been around as long as I have, to have Mormons and gays in the same sentence is quite something,' Bob Rees, a visiting professor of Mormon Studies at the Graduate Theological Union and the University of California, Berkeley, said. Support: Tom and Wendy Montgomery had protested against gay marriage in California but now they want tolerance . Fears: Jordan Montgomery was worried his parents would disown him because he is gay . The church has only gone so far though. At a conference this weekend, church apostle Dallin Oaks reiterated that human laws cannot 'make moral what God has declared immoral'. The website, set live in December, reinforced that while same-sex attraction itself isn't a sin, succumbing to it is. The contrasting messages have left many Mormons struggling to figure out where they stand. Mrs Montgomery is among them. Her world changed after she read her son's journal last year and learned he was gay. 'I'm looking at this 13-year-old boy who is totally innocent and pure and an amazing kid and I think, ""Either everything I know about homosexuality is wrong, or my son is not really gay. And, he's obviously gay"".' she said. 'I kind of had to unlearn everything I had learned.' The family, from Bakersfield in California, set out on a six-month spiritual journey as they reconciled their love for their son, Jordan, with the teachings of their faith. They let family and friends in the church know he was gay and established that they wouldn't tolerate harsh treatment of their son. Change: Mormons march in Salt Lake City's gay pride parade in June . They remain faithful Mormons, but have switched congregations after enduring ridicule from friends and fellow church members. One woman told Mrs Montgomery her children should be taken away from her and given to somebody who follows the teachings of the prophet. Mrs Montgomery and her husband had to step down from their church positions - he was the assistant bishop and she was a Sunday school teacher for teenagers - after parents flooded the bishop's office with complaints that they were teaching homosexual propaganda. Their story is featured in a documentary made by the Family Acceptance Project at San Francisco State University. The Montgomerys found the organization after becoming frustrated with church therapists who told them Jordan was just going through a phase. The organization works with conservative religious families to help them navigate their doctrines while accepting their gay children. Caitlin Ryan, the project director, has written a pamphlet specifically designed for Mormons that has been distributed throughout Utah churches. She said she believes the church is paying attention to research that shows suicide has been a major issue with LGBT Mormon youth for decades. In the documentary, Jordan said he had suicidal thoughts and was worried about how his parents would react to his sexuality. Acceptance: The church has become more tolerant, with members joining the gay pride parade for the past two years . 'Our most important value in the church is family. I was mortified at the idea of being disowned by my parents,' he said. Mrs Montgomery doesn't know how long her son will remain in the church, but steps taken in the past year have given her hope that church leaders will one day reverse their stance on homosexuality. 'There are so many that grew up in my situation, in conservative, religious homes that are being taught this,' she said. 'It's just not accurate. It's not right. And it's so damaging to the kids.'","Parents who campaigned against same-sex marriage have joined calls for more acceptance .

Online TV giant Netflix is rumoured to be in talks with cable companies in a bid to launch a TV service. Reed Hastings, chief executive of Netflix, has allegedly met with some of the biggest cable companies in recent weeks to discuss plans which could present a rival to HBO. Three people who claim to be close to the talks said the service would come through set-top boxes, with a fourth adding that it could be an extra option added to a viewer's bill. Leading online TV company Netflix is rumoured to be in talks with cable companies about a deal which could see it become a paid on-demand service to rival HBO . The move would represent a major about-face in relations between the company and TV providers, who initially saw the internet giant as a big threat to their $100billion-a-year (£62.5bn) industry. Hastings has strongly hinted at investor conferences in recent weeks about the possibility of Netflix one day being a cable channel rival to premium networks such as Time Warner's HBO. He said: 'It's not in the short term, but it's in the natural direction for us in the long term. Many (cable service providers) would like to have a competitor to HBO, and they would bid us off of HBO.' While many played off the remarks as general speculation about the future, others have suggested that at least one cable provider could experiment with the service by the end of the year. Talks are though to involve Comcast Corp and Suddenlink Communications, though Netflix will not comment on the rumours. The move would give Netflix more room to expand its subscriptions as internet capabilities stuggle to keep up with demand. The service already accounts for a third of all peak US internet traffic, using almost twice as much bandwidth as YouTube. The market potential is clear too, as in a recent survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers 70 per cent of those polled said they still subscribed to cable, while 41 per cent said they used Netflix. A PricewaterhouseCoopers poll in June showed that, while 41 per cent of people use Netflix, a whopping 70 per cent still subscribe to cable TV . However, the world's most popular streaming service still has some way to go in order to compete in the TV market. Despite producing the award winning show House of Cards, its original content falls way behind the likes of HBO, who are behind dozens of hit series including Game of Thrones, True Blood, Boardwalk Empire and Curb Your Enthusiasm. Time Warner Inc Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes famously dismissed the idea that Netflix was a serious threat by equating the service to the 'Albanian Army.' It must also face down stiff competition online from the likes of Google, Apple and Amazon who are thought to have major plans in the works. Even if a deal is reached in the near-term, actually receiving Netflix through a cable provider could still take months to launch. Hastings would first need to rework his licensing deals with programmers since most existing contracts will not allow Netflix to deliver their shows on a cable box, according to a senior programming executive. Netflix is currently the world's leading internet television network with more than 37 million members in 40 countries watching more than one billion hours of TV programmes and films every month. On the back of the news Netflix shares gained almost 8 per cent in trading yesterday closing at just under $325 (£203) per share.","Sources claim internet service is in talks with cable companies .

Fifteen years ago today, a small online bookseller made its first sales in Britain. Now it has grown into a global internet phenomenon, offering everything from clothes to car parts, raking in £4billion a year and causing carnage among high street retailers. And it all happened with a substantial helping hand from some Harry Potter hocus pocus. A list of Amazon’s best-sellers released to mark its birthday shows the part JK Rowling’s magical books, and the associated films and computer games, have played in the website’s transformation. In a list released to mark the website's 15th birthday, Ms Rowling's franchise - including films and games - comes top . Billions: The small-scale British bookseller now sells car parts and clothes earning £4billion a year . In 1998, the best-selling product was Amsterdam, a Booker prize-winning morality tale by Ian McEwan. But the next year the third Harry Potter book – Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban – proved a runaway success, while later instalments topped the list in 2000, 2003, 2005 and 2007. The Tales Of Beedle The Bard, a related book of stories, sold most in 2008. Harry Potter films led video and DVD sales in four years, and a computer game was a 2001 best-seller. Amazon’s vice president of EU retail, Xavier Garambois, said: ‘The annual best-sellers help to tell a story of the phenomena that have gripped the UK. Since starting out as an online bookseller in 1998, Amazon.co.uk has expanded year on year and now offers customers more than 100million products.’ Best-seller: The book and the film versions of JK Rowling's Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban boosted Amazon sales in 1999 and 2003 respectively . Flagship sellers: EL James' Fifty Shades Of Grey and Jamie Oliver's cookbooks also boosted sales for the site . The list, released by the website, gives a snapshot of Britain’s buying habits, from gadgets and kitchen products to films and music. Last year, EL James’s erotic novel Fifty Shades Of Grey topped the book list, initiating a new literary genre of so-called ‘mummy porn’.  Stieg Larsson’s dark thriller The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo was number one in both 2010 and 2011, while ultra-violent video game Grand Theft Auto 5, created in Britain, is a best-seller this year, reaching a bigger audience than most blockbuster films. On a more wholesome note, TV chef Jamie Oliver’s books were top sellers in 2001 and 2010. The figures record the company’s rapid expansion, with best-selling home goods first listed in 2003, and MP3 music sales in 2008. the amazon phenomenon by numbers . Amazon’s fierce discounts and low overheads have helped it build UK sales of more than £4billion. The retailer enjoys an advantage over high street rivals since it does not have to pay to maintain stores, including rent, rates and staff. Controversially, it has also avoided tax, paying a paltry £2.4million to the UK Treasury last year. It also received £2.5million in Government and EU grants for operating warehouses in less prosperous areas. The figures have angered MPs on the Commons Public Accounts Committee. Its chairman Margaret Hodge has said: ‘Its behaviour is not only unfair, it is anti-competitive, putting British businesses that do pay the proper tax at a disadvantage.’","Global retailer earns £4m a year selling anything from clothes to car parts .

Prince William is set to step up as a senior royal this week when he hosts his first investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace. William will represent the Queen during the hour-long event on Thursday, when he will hand out medals to luminaries – including an OBE to British tennis star Andrew Murray – and dub new knights with a sword. The 31-year-old prince has told aides he is ‘a bit nervous’ about the service, when dozens of recipients will be honoured. A royal insider said: ‘William has been practising using the sword and pinning the medals on a servant so that he gets it right. ‘He obviously doesn’t want to slice anyone’s ear off or stick a pin into their chest. ‘Above all he realises this is the biggest day in the lives of some people who are being honoured, and he wants it to go well for them.’ The source added: ‘His biggest challenge is being tall – it’s not easy to stoop down and talk to some of the smaller recipients and to pin the honours on.’ Last month Kensington Palace announced that the second in line to the throne was to leave his full-time job as an RAF search-and-rescue pilot in order to take on a greater royal role. The prince was immediately criticised, however, for suggesting that he would not significantly increase the number of official duties he does each year - which stands at just 40 or so, compared to more than 300 conducted by his grandmother – in favour of a ‘transitional year’, learning more about the way the monarchy works. The prince will hand out honours to deserving individuals, including tennis star Andy Murray . Although he has represented the Queen on official visits abroad, Thursday’s investiture will be the most significant role he has carried out her behalf to date – and is one he will regularly conduct when he is king. It is not clear why the Queen has asked her grandson to go as she has no official engagements in her diary on that date. But it is known that the 87-year-old monarch finds standing for up to an hour at a time, leaning forwards to pin on the medals and wielding her heavy sword, rather tiring and a great strain on her back. Joanne Harris receives an MBE from the Queen at an Investiture Ceremony at Buckingham Palace on October 10 . ‘The Prince was always going to start doing more royal duties but he wants to add them in slowly and do each one well without rushing into things,’ said a source yesterday. Around 25 investitures are held every year, mostly at Buckingham Palace, but also at Windsor Castle and Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh. As well as the Queen, they are sometimes performed by Prince Charles and, on rare occasions, Princess Anne. At the start of the ceremony William will enter the Ballroom attended by two Gurkha orderly officers, a tradition begun by Queen Victoria in 1876. Having served in the Army, Royal Navy and RAF, William will have a choice of uniform, but Prince Charles normally wears a Royal Navy outfit. Also on duty will be members of the Queen’s Body Guard of the Yeoman of the Guard, created by Henry VII in 1485. Music will be provided by a military band or an orchestra from the Purcell School of Music. After the national anthem has been played, either the Lord Chamberlain or a Lord in Waiting will announce the name of each recipient and their achievement. William will then award them the decoration before congratulating them, shaking their hand and having a brief chat. Those who receive a knighthood kneel on the investiture stool and are dubbed on the shoulder by the royal using a sword which belonged to the Queen’s father George VI. Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, attend the Tusk Conservation awards on September 12 . As well as Andy Murray, other notables taking part on Thursday include Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Christopher Allison, National Olympic Security Co-ordinator for London 2012, and comedy producer Jon Plowman. In October last year Her Majesty pulled out of an investiture at Windsor Castle with a bad back and Prince Charles had to fly down from Scotland to hand out 90 honours. The Queen has suffered from sciatica, which causes lower back pain and numbness in the legs, as well as knee problems that required surgery. She stands for the entire hour during every investiture, and two years ago the dais in the Waterloo Chamber at Windsor Castle was lowered by a few inches so that she didn’t have to stoop down so far to pin medals on. ‘It is quite a strenuous exercise to hand out the medals without mistakes, engage people in conversation and to keep bending down,’ said an insider. ‘The Queen has done it without complaint for years but she is now 87, and she will be delighted that William is stepping up to support her by taking on some of her duties.’ A Buckingham Palace spokesman declined to comment, saying details of royals taking part in investitures were never announced until the day.","Prince set to 'step-up' as a senior royal at first investiture ceremony .

The man had allegedly struck a female usher and was resisting arrest when he was sprayed. Gone viral: A photo has emerged of the moment a police officer sprayed a handcuffed football fan in the face with pepper spray from just inches away . The Michigan fan appears to have his arms secured behind his back by police officers as they try to escort him away from the crowd. But the man's face is contorted in pain as the painful anti-riot device is blasted near his right eye. Photos show he had already been sprayed in his left eye leaving a trail of what appears to be blood across his face. Some members of the crowd are oblivious or unperturbed by the scene as they smile and clap during the long game which started at 5pm, while others turn and watch in shock.

It is irritating to the eyes and respiratory passages and used as a disabling device. It is generally used by spraying it directly into an individual’s eyes, forcing them to close them. The spray gives a burning sensation which will last approximately 30 minutes. The idea behind the use of a pepper spray is that the receiver suffers from reduced vision and is therefore less likely to approach police in a threatening way. There are many criticisms of the use of pepper spray ranging from the fact that it does not work on all individuals to the suggestion it could cause more damage to the eyes than first thought. Penn State Police Chief Tyrone Parham acknowledged the incident in a statement released by the university Monday. 'Fans in section NL asked an usher for assistance when the man became disruptive and offensive toward them. 'When the usher tried to eject him from the stadium, he allegedly struck her, which is when police were called to assist. 'Four officers responded - two from State College and two from Penn State - but when they tried to remove him from the stadium he continued spewing expletives, became physical and resisted arrest. 'At that point it became a safety issue and that's when the decision was made to use the pepper spray and attempt to handcuff him.'

Grocery stores in New York City have been accused of hundreds of health violations including infestations of cockroaches, dead mice and meat left to rot by being kept at unsafe temperatures, it has emerged. The supermarkets which recorded large numbers of serious breaches include upmarket brands such as Whole Foods Market. Among the most off-putting incidents found were a store using a baseball bat to grind meat, fridges with mould inside and the mouse droppings which were discovered in dozens of outlets. Worst offender: This grocery store in Brooklyn, now a branch of Met Foods, recorded 72 serious health violations between 2008 and this year . The scale of the health violations found in the city was laid bare in an analysis of public health records from 2008 to 2013, carried out by the New York World. Annual inspections of every grocery store in New York are carried out by the state Department of Agriculture and Markets, which records any incidents posing 'an immediate threat to the public health and welfare'. Last year, inspectors found 597 serious violations - down from 1,100 in 2008. The most common major offence of all is the presence of 'animal activity', particularly mouse droppings, which have been discovered in grocery stores more than 700 times in the past five years. Use this graphic to browse all the offenders across New York . Upscale: But Whole Foods Market on the Upper West Side recorded 12 serious offences last year . Another of the most frequent violations is the preparation of food on contaminated surfaces, or by workers who have not washed their hands properly. In addition, meat and fish are often kept at the wrong temperature, the records showed, which causes them to go off more quickly and encourages the formation of illness-causing bacteria. More unusual violations include the discovery of 200 cockroaches inside the basement of a branch of Pioneer Supermarkets in the Bronx. The worst offender of all since 2008 has been a branch of Met Foods, formerly Fine Fare, in the Cypress Hills neighbourhood of Brooklyn. A total of 72 serious violations were recorded at the supermarket over the past five years, including six mouse carcasses and hundreds of mouse droppings. Safe: Trader Joe's recorded just a single violation across all of its branches in New York City . Other stores to have come in for criticism include high-end supermarkets such as Whole Foods, whose branch on Manhattan's Upper West Side recorded 12 major offences last year. The store, which has become emblematic of the affluent middle class in New York, was found to contain fresh mouse droppings near the bakery, while meat grinders were encrusted with old food. A spokesman for the company told the Daily News that 'citations are taken very seriously' and said that the firm was co-operating fully with health inspectors. However, other popular chains did much better in the health records - Trader Joe's, one of the leading competitors to Whole Foods, recorded just one serious violation from 2008 to 2013. The worst chain was Associated, a network of independent stores, with 739 serious offences across its 130 branches.","600 violations posing an 'immediate threat' found in New York last year .

A promising George Washington University medical student told police he killed his best friend after catching him having an affair with his girlfriend. 24-year-old Rahul Gupta was charged with second-degree murder in relation to the stabbing death of his best friend and Georgetown law student Mark Waugh early Sunday morning in Silver Springs, Virginia. According to police, Gupta, his 23-year-old girlfriend, Waugh and one other had spent Saturday out celebrating Gupta's birthday. Best friends: Rahul Gupta (right) told police that he killed his best friend, Mark Waugh (left), after catching him having an affair with his girlfriend . Dark turn: Gupta, his girlfriend, Waugh and another spent Saturday night out celebrating Gupta's birthday. The first three later returned to the girlfriend's apartment where they continued to drink shots. Waugh was found dead at 3:30am Sunday morning . After drinking, Gupta and Waugh returned to Gupta's girlfriend's apartment in Silver Springs where the three continued drinking shots of alcohol. Neighbors later reported hearing loud noises coming from the apartment, like people were moving furniture. Shortly before 3:30am Sunday morning, police responded to a 911 call made by the girlfriend. When they arrived on the scene, police reported hearing movements and yelling inside but no one answered the door when they knocked. Trouble in paradise: Gupta told police that he caught Waugh and his girlfriend cheating and that's why he killed him. Above, two pictures of Gupta with a girlfriend uploaded to his Facebook within the last year . Police opened the locked door and the girlfriend approached the officers with blood on her and said: 'I don't know what happened. Can you tell me?' Officers noted seeing blood on the walls of the kitchen and living area and Gupta lying on the floor, covered in blood. They asked Gupta if he was hurt but he said: 'I don't think so'. When they asked him what had happened, he replied: 'I walked in on my girlfriend cheating on me. My girl and my buddy were cheating. My girl was cheating with my buddy. I walked in on them cheating and I killed my buddy.' Officers found Waugh lying on the floor unresponsive and he was pronounced dead. He was covered in blood with 'multiple cutting and defense-type injuries to his body'. Police say a knife was used in the attack. Who to believe? While Gupta says he was woken up by his girlfriend yelling, the girlfriend told police she was woken up by Gupta's yelling. She says she found him kneeling next to a bleeding Waugh and he told her to call police. Above, a picture of Waugh . Gupta and his girlfriend have a differing account of what happened before police were called. Gupta told police officers that he was woken up by his girlfriend yelling. It's uncertain whether he actually saw something going on, but he told officers that he thought Waugh and his girlfriend were in a relationship behind his back and that Waugh had tried to harm him and his family. At police headquarters, Gupta admitted that he made a mistake, but added: 'He tried to kill me, though'. Defense? While being questioned by police, Gupta admitted that he made a mistake but also said that Waugh tried to kill him . But the girlfriend says Gupta woke her up and not the other way around. She says she doesn't remember anything after having the last shots back at the apartment but that she was later woken up by Gupta yelling and telling her to call 911. That's when she woke up and saw him kneeling next to Waugh who was bleeding heavily. As of Monday, Gupta was being held at the Montgomery County Jail on $2million bond. The Gazette spoke to Nancy Waugh, the victim's mother, yesterday who said she was still in shock and couldn't believe what had happened. She said her son and Gupta had been best friends ever since they met attending Langley High School in McLean, Virignia. Close: Both Waugh's mother and Gupta's father expressed shock after hearing about the killing. Waugh's mother Nancy says the two were best friends ever since they met attending Langley High School . 'It's very hard right now,' Mrs Waugh said. Full of promise: After graduating Magna Cum Laude from James Madison University, Waugh spent a year teaching debate in South Korea.

WJLA was able to speak with Gupta's father over the phone who said he was 'saddened' and 'very surprised' by Waugh's death and his son's subsequent arrest. Waugh had graduated Magna Cum Laude from James Madison University in May 2012, and went on to spend the following year in Daegu, South Korea teaching debate. This fall, Waugh had started his first year of law school at Georgetown, and was inducted into the Phi Beta Kappa honors society. Gupta had a similarly bright future. He earned his undergraduate degree from George Washington University and was back at the school studying to become a doctor. He also earned a master's degree in physiology from Georgetown. Fellow Langley High School-alumnus David Barton spoke about both men in The Breeze - James Madison University's student newspaper. He remembers both men for being extremely intelligent in their respective fields, Waugh in liberal arts and Gupta with science and math. 'It's very shocking when something like this happens when you know each person involved,' Barton told The Breeze. 'You think that - how can people you think to be rational have something like this take place. You just hope that the situation could have de-escalated'. Smart: Gupta was similarly accomplished.

Heavily armed soldiers inspect the room where an explosion occurred at Traders Hotel in central Rangoon late last night . A female American tourist has been rushed to hospital with wounds to her thigh and hand after a time bomb blew up in her room just before midnight yesterday. The 43-year-old woman had just arrived in the room with her family at the five-star Traders Hotel in central Rangoon, Burma. The bomb was attached to a clock in the bathroom and was designed to go off when the next guests checked in to the ninth floor apartment. The woman's husband and their two children, aged five and seven, 'miraculously' escaped injury, said officials. It is understood the family were all in the main hotel room when the explosion occurred. The explosion was powerful enough to blast toiletries and a purse into the entrance hall, rip a wardrobe door from its hinges and blow out windows, showering the street below with glass. Police said today that they had detained three men in connection with the bombing, including a 27-year-old man who had previously stayed in the room. 'It is still too early to say it was he who planted the bomb without further investigations,' said a police official. The American woman, who has not been named, was deeply shocked, said officials, but her condition was improving. 'We're still investigating and it's an ongoing process,' said Police Lieutenant General Min Aung of the intelligence and security department. The hotel, part of the luxury Shangri-La group, is located in the heart of the city and is popular with foreign tourists and visiting business people. Miss Lori Lincoln, a spokeswoman for the Hong Kong-based hotel group, said staff were working closely with police. 'Our priority right now is to look after the guest that was injured and the guest's family and to assist the police with their investigation.'

A dozen police and heavily armed soldiers . with a sniffer dog entered the glitzy hotel soon after the explosion. Later, many of them crowded into the destroyed room, blocked off with . yellow security tape, to inspect the damage. Others carrying assault rifles and wearing bullet proof vests strolled through the main lobby. Sarah Hutchison, the U.S. Embassy press officer, told The Telegraph: 'Our consular officers in Rangoon (Yangon) have visited the U.S. citizen and are providing appropriate consular assistance,' but refused to comment further. Mysterious explosions in other parts of the country have resulted in two other suspects being detained for questioning, said police. Last Friday a man and a woman were killed and another person injured when a bomb went off at a guest house in the town of Taunggu. Two other devices exploded in Rangoon . on Sunday - one at a bus stop and another under a truck. Two teenagers . were injured in the truck blast. In . yet more terror attacks, two makeshift devices were found in Rangoon . and in the city of Mandaly on Monday, and earlier today blasts occurred . at a restaurant and near a pagoda in the north western region of .

Officers say it is a miracle that the woman's husband and two children, aged five and seven, were not hurt . Police have arrested two other men after a series of bombs went off across the country, killing several, while other devices were found unexploded . It is not known if the blasts are linked, but officials said groups determined to derail democratic reforms could be behind them as the country prepares to host a major regional sporting event and a meeting of  the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Alarmed at a time bomb being left in a hotel room, Presidential spokesman Ye Htut said the blasts were intended to spread fear. ''This is being done too make people worried and scared' said Mr Htut. 'It is being done to make the international community misunderstand the situation and peace in Myanmar' he told Radio Free Asia's Myanmar Service. Government officials fear that as news spreads about a time bomb being left in a hotel room, tourist numbers will drop. As alarm began to spread that terrorists were mounting a campaign to upend the ASEAN conference, police urged the public to keep their eyes open for any suspicious packages, particularly in market places, bus stops and railway stations.","Blast happened just before midnight yesterday in Rangoon .

Chicago is famous for its soaring skyline, but hidden from view is a 62-mile grid of abandoned freight tunnels once considered an engineering masterwork. Although the impressive grid connects all major railroad freight houses and many commercial . establishments in downtown Chicago, few people ever saw this system from construction in 1899 to its abandonment in 1959. It wasn't until a contractor kicked a hole into the side of the one of the bores during the 1992 floods that the doomed passageways became big news. Out of business: Almost a century after construction, the doomed Chicago tunnels had helped facilitate the Chicago Flood of 1992, despite chief engineer George W. Jackson¿s original intention that measures to prevent flooding be maintained . Chicago: The Illinois Telephone and Telegraph built the first 26 miles of this concrete tunnel by 1905. But the Illinois Tunnel Company which took over, building another 60 miles, went bankrupt in 1909 and construction stopped . Multi-purpose: In 1912, the Chicago Tunnel Company started using the track to move merchandise, coal and ash before abandoning the unprofitable tunnels in 1959 . In 1899, Illinois Telephone and Telegraph laid narrow-gauge railway in underground tunnels to help it excavate the tunnels, according to The Weather Channel. Under the watchful eye of chief engineer George W. Jackson, the company built the first 26 miles of tunnel to hold telegraph and telephone cables. In 1905, the Illinois Tunnel Company took over construction, expanding the network to 60 miles before it went bankrupt in 1909. The network, widely considered cursed, was taken over by the Chicago Tunnel Company which sold the communication installations and . cables but continued to use the track to move merchandise, coal and ash in 1912. The group was finally forced to abandon the unprofitable tunnels in . 1959.

After it was abandoned, many Chicagoans forgot about the concrete tunnels until April 1992 when one of them under the Chicago River near Kinzie Street was punctured, flooding most of the system and two dozen downtown buildings with open tunnel connections.

Liverpool Crown Court heard Paula Clinton was brutally stabbed by her husband, John, after she 'goaded' him over the size of his manhood . A man inflicted multiple fatal stab wounds on his wife after she taunted him about this size of his manhood, a court heard. John Clinton, 52, brutally attacked Paula Clinton, his partner of 24 years, before slashing his own throat in a bid to end his life. Liverpool Crown Court heard Mrs Clinton became disgruntled about her husband's heavy drinking and - on the day she was killed - he arrived home from the pub to find her discussing their prospective divorce over the phone. Clinton, who had drunk 10 pints, plunged a knife into his wife's back four times during a row at their home in Aintree, Liverpool, on November 28 last year. Jurors heard Clinton, a partner in a company that makes concrete products, would regularly stop at the pub on his way home. On the day she died Mrs Clinton had been to visit the Citizens' Advice Bureau to discuss dividing the couple's assets. She was on the phone to one of their advisers when Clinton came home drunk. The . mother-of-two, who worked at the Giro social club in Bootle for 30 years, . was seen staggering from the family home and down the street bleeding heavily before . collapsing. She had multiple stab wounds to her body, . hands and her left eye and died from shock and blood loss before paramedics arrived. Armed . police were called to the family home where they found Clinton had . slashed his wrists and neck in a 'serious attempt' to kill himself. There was blood all over the house, including splattered on a set of papers marked 'ending a marriage'. Clinton, who admits manslaughter but denies murder, told detectives he had killed his wife after he just 'lost it'. He told police his wife was pushing him and goading him, asking who would look after him with his bed-wetting and small manhood. 'This man, with 10 pints inside him, lost . his temper but still had the presence of mind to go into the kitchen, . select a knife from the drawer and go after his wife with it' - Ian Unsworth, QC . Ian Unsworth, QC, told Liverpool Crown Court: 'It is apparent that the marriage was in some difficulties in the days leading up to her death and on the day itself. 'Paula was seeking advice as to divorce and the financial arrangements which would follow. 'According to things she said to others, the reason she sought a divorce arose largely out of the defendant’s drinking, culminating with an incident in October when he was stopped by the police as he was driving his vehicle and had drunk in excess of the legal limit. 'That seems to have been the last straw so far as she was concerned.' Mr Unsworth said Clinton had threatened his wife with a knife a few weeks before her death and that 'in drink he had become a bully and a dangerous one at that'. He added: 'No doubt the defendant bitterly regrets his actions that night but it is clear from what he has said that he does seek to justify his actions, at least in part, by painting a picture of his wife and her conduct which is not a true picture. 'Whether it was the revelation that his wife was seeking financial advice of her own or something else that happened, this man, with 10 pints inside him, lost his temper but still had the presence of mind to go into the kitchen, select a knife from the drawer and go after his wife with it.' The trial continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","John Clinton claims partner Paula was 'pushing and goading' him .

The army is soon to announce its new $4 billion camouflage pattern and standard uniform to be worn by its soldiers as it comes under criticism for ‘wasting’ $5 billion on its last uniform which lasted less than a decade. The billion-dollar experiment to create a universal pattern, known as the Universal Camouflage Pattern, or UCP, is being phased out as the army gets ready to reveal the new uniform. The army decided to scrap the two traditional camouflage uniforms that had long been used by the military - one meant for woodland environments, another for the desert – in favour of the UCP, which they said could be worn anywhere and blend in with any environment. Out with the old: The army's UCP grey uniform is being scrapped after less than 10 years . 'Blends into a parking lot': Critics say the pattern of the UCP does not work in combat areas . However, after less than 10 years in use, soldiers and critics say the UCP was a waste of money. In 2009, Congress responded to soldiers’ concerns about the current combat uniform which they indicated provides ineffective camouflage given the environment in Afghanistan. The result was the MultiCam uniform, which is currently being worn by US troops in Afghanistan. But the uniform was only meant to be an interim substitution for the UCP, which is still the army’s official uniform and the one worn by all soldiers who are not overseas. Temporary solution: The MultiCam uniform was introduced in 2009 after soldiers complained their UCP uniform did not blend into the Afghani environment . Put to good use: The MultiCam is the uniform currently being used by troops in Afghanistan because it blends into the environment better than the UCP . The UCP provided 'ineffective camouflage given the environment in Afghanistan', which is why the army now wears the substitute uniform, shown here . Former Army Officer Matt Gallagher said during his 15-month deployment to Iraq from 2007-2009, he became well acquainted with the shortfalls of the universal camouflage pattern, according to The Daily Beast. In an attempt to blend in with all kinds of environments, the pattern instead wound up sticking out everywhere, its grey, gravel design that only a help to soldiers hoping to blend in with a parking lot. Army Sergeant Matt Pelak laughs at the mention of the universal camouflage pattern. ‘It is one of the things that drives me craziest about the army I have to admit,’ he told The Daily Beast. We started rolling it out in 2005 and everyone was baffled by it.’ While Pelak admits there were some upsides to the design, such as easy-to-access pockets, his complaints outweighed the positives. ‘Even currently, in my unit, we wear the normal uniform, the UCP when we’re back on base, but when we go in the field we wear MultiCam,’ he said. ‘We have to carry two uniforms around, one that functions properly and one that’s merely administrative.’ Former Army Officer Matt Gallagher said during his 15-month deployment to Iraq from 2007-2009, he became well acquainted with the shortfalls of the universal camouflage pattern . Soldiers day they have to carry two different uniforms at the moment - one that functions properly and one that¿s merely administrative . For the new, as-yet-unreleased uniform, the army solicited designs from companies for patterns with three variations, one for the desert, another for woodlands and jungles and a third, traditional semi-wooded pattern similar to the one currently used by soldiers in Afghanistan. After several rounds of testing, four patterns with three variations for each, from companies in New York, Virginia and Alaska were submitted to the army to choose a winner. The winner has yet to be announced. Last year, the Government Accountability Office, a federal watchdog agency, issued a report about the army spending $5 billion on the UCP uniforms and field equipment, only to spend an estimated $4 billion on the new design. The Natick Army Soldier Systems Center conducted two studies on the UCP - once in 2006 and again in 2009 - both times finding that the UCP¿s performance came up short . The Natick Army Soldier Systems Center, which does research and development on things like food, clothing, shelter for the military, conducted two studies on the UCP - once in 2006 and again in 2009 - both times finding that the UCP’s performance came up short when compared to other, more popular camouflages, like the Marine Corps desert pattern or the MultiCam. Whether the current quest for the consummate camouflage will prove time and money well spent or yet another waste remains to be seen. According to Pelak, the soliders are still ‘stuck with a uniform we can’t wear in the field’.","Army to announce its new $4 billion camouflage pattern and standard uniform to be worn by its soldiers .

It's not what you would call a traditional method of saying goodbye to a loved one, but one woman has turned urn designs into something of an art form. Anne Leigh, 65, has created the containers in a range of shapes, including a flat cap and a boat, in a bid to emulate the personality, likes or hobbies of the person who has passed away. The artist from Aslacton, Norfolk, started making her unique designs when she created a suitcase for her mother's ashes to represent her love of travelling. She has since constructed shopping bags and even musical instruments to hold the final remains of beloved individuals. Unique: Artist Anne Leigh has spoken of how she creates bespoke urns in a bid to illustrate the personality of the departed. Pictured are urns in the shape of a tea set . Heartfelt: Ms Leigh's unique designs started when her mother died and she decided to create an urn in the shape of a suitcase because she loved to travel . Design: One of her more original designs is this flat-cap urn she created . Musical: Ms Leigh has even created urns in the shape of musical instruments, such as this ukulele . Her unique designs started when her mother died and she wanted to make the perfect container for her final journey. She said: 'The more quirky designs started when my mum died, I wanted to create something that represented her life. 'I made her a suitcase urn because she loved to travel and I added labels for all the places she loved visiting.' The designs are created from paper, card, paints and adhesives as well as string, cotton and leaves. Ms Leigh said: 'The main challenge is the materials used, making sure they are all biodegradable is very difficult. 'I love the challenge of making them but also being part of a moment significant to other people' At work: Ms Leigh makes the urns from paper, card, paints and adhesives as well as string, cotton and leaves . Challenge: Ms Leigh said the main challenge of making the urns was to make sure they are biodegradable . Bespoke: One of Ms Leigh's more intricate creations was this boat on a globe (left), made for a sailor. Ms Leigh also created this Harrods bag (right) for a self-confessed shopaholic . Intricate: Many of the creations are intricately designed and are all made from biodegradable materials . 'The most difficult urn I've ever created was the ukulele urn, which was made of paper and cardboard but was incredibly difficult to shape.' Ms Leigh also created an urn of a boat on a globe for a sailor. She said: 'The boat was a model of the actual boat, set on the globe so that when put in the sea, the globe containing the ashes would sink, freeing the boat to take its chances on the ocean. 'It is very challenging because each urn needs to be fool-proof because it is such an important moment and the rituals have to be perfect.' Among the artist's numerous other creations are a range of teapots and tea cup urns and a Harrods bag urn for a self-confessed shopaholic. Personal: Ms Leigh said each urn is 'intensely personal to the person it holds' 'Moving': The artist described making each urn 'an incredibly moving process' One of her more original pieces is a flat-cap urn she created for one woman's grandfather. Ms Leigh said: 'His granddaughter said he loved his flat cap and he was never without it. 'Each urn is intensely personal to the person it holds and making them is an incredibly moving process. 'An important aspect of the urns I make which is very important to me is their impermanence - they all go into the earth or water. 'Some of the detailing on the suitcase and the ukulele look as though they are metal. However they are made of paper, card & a couple of toothpicks.'","Anne Leigh started designing more unusual urns after her mother died .

From Hollywood starlets Judy Garland and Audrey Hepburn, to freedom fighters John F Kennedy and Rosa Parks, there is even a moving tribute to the Sandy Hook shooting victims . The designers, Passion for Pumpkins, will spend 30 days from October 3 until November 3 tending to the prized pumpkins, which are all lit with LED lights. The artworks, like this one featuring rock legend Bruce Springsteen, are drawn with a permanent marker before special carving tools are used to add highlights .

The crew from Passion for Pumpkins, led by John Reckner, consists of full-time artists and many part-timers who use ballpoint pens, oil-based markers and paring knives to create spectacular pumpkin art. Instead of cutting through the pumpkin, the crew shaves off the skin, then the bottom is cut out and the inside is cleaned, leaving the skin about a quarter of an inch thick. This allows the light bulb to illuminate the image on the outside.","One exhibit in Rhode Island features famous faces .

Any mother with a teething child will know that anything and everything becomes a target for a baby's gnawing gums - especially the jewellery dangling temptingly within their grasp. But not only does that mean your favourite beads becoming covered in a fine layer of drool and tiny tooth imprints, but beads can be dangerous for babies to put in their mouths, whether because they are covered in toxic paint, easily breakable or sharp. Now one company Gumigem is aiming to tackle this problem by creating a range of fashion jewellery mothers will actually be keen to wear - but that babies can use to soothe their painful gums. Gumigem allows mothers to keep following fashions while also removing the worry that their little one will put something dangerous in their mouths . All Gumigem pieces are made of non toxic siilcone that is free from lead, latex, BPAs, PVC and phthalates . Kerry Katona and Nell McAndrew have spoken out about their love for the product . The aim is that mothers should still be able to look fashionable while wearing something that baby can safely get their teeth into (literally). Started by Jenny McLaughlan, 37, from Dundee, Gumigem already has a celebrity following, with the Daily Record reporting that Sienna Miller, Nell McAndrew, Coleen Rooney and Kerry Katona are fans. Jenny, mother to Maisie, five, and Miller, three, came up with the concept for Gumigem when Miller was teething. The products are simple and elegant, but most importantly safe for baby . Gumigem's Miller heart pendant in Mercury, £12.95 (left), Gumigem's Pip in Autumn, £15.95 (right) Jenny said: ‘Miller was a nightmare . teether. There were times I would strap teething rings to my neck so I . always had something to hand. ‘Then it struck me that I could come up with something that looked good and doubled as a teether.’ Some babies are born with their first teeth, others start teething before they are four months old, and some after 12 months. Early teething should not cause a child any problems, unless it affects their feeding. You may notice that the gum is sore and red where the tooth is coming through, or that one cheek is flushed. Your baby may dribble, gnaw and chew a lot, or just be fretful. As well as giving safe things to chew, cool drinks, sugar-free teething gel and infant painkillers can help. If you baby is dribbling a lot, be sure to wipe their face often to prevent a rash. Some people attribute a wide range of symptoms to teething, such as diarrhoea and fever, however, there is no research to prove that these other symptoms are linked. Source: NHS.uk . Originally . working on the company in her spare time, Jenny has now left her job in . the pharmaceutical industry to focus on the company, along with her . husband Stuart, 44. The pieces, which cost from £8.95 for a bangle, are simple but elegant and include pendants, beaded necklaces, bangles and even dog tags for men. As . well as allowing mothers to continue accessorising during their child's . teething, wearing the teether means there is always something available . for the baby to chew on. In . addition to easing discomfort, chewing while teething is beneficial as it helps the new teeth erupt. The dishwasher-safe necklaces, which are made of non toxic silicone that is . free from lead, latex, BPAs, PVC and phthalates, all feature a breakaway clasp so they come away if baby pulls rather than hurting the wearer. Silicone is ideal for the pieces as it is odourless, tasteless and will not support the growth of bacteria or mould. Gemigum stress on their website that the necklaces are only intended for an adult to wear and children must only have access to it when worn by an adult. However, the bangles can be left with the child unattended.","Gumigem started by Jenny McLaughlan, 37, from Dundee .

Killed: A bomb attack on a mosque in Afghanistan killed Arsala Jamal the governor of a province south of Kabul . The governor of a province in eastern Afghanistan was killed by a bomb hidden in a microphone during morning prayers at a mosque, officials said. Arsala Jamal was killed as he was making an address on the first day of the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha, officials said. He was governor of Logar . province, a strategically important province on the southern approaches . to Kabul and home to one of Afghanistan's richest mines. A friend of the country's president, he had previously been governor of violence-plagued Khost province on the Pakistani border and the killing of such a senior official will raise new fears for Afghanistan's security as foreign troops prepare to leave by the end of next year. 'When the governor was giving a speech it detonated. He is martyred,' said Jamal's spokesman, Din Mohammad Darwish. No-one has claimed responsibility, and Jamal was the sole fatality. Jamal was a close friend of President Hamid Karzai and served as his campaign manager during his successful bid for re-election in 2009. He had already survived at least one . attempt on his life, when a suicide bomber in a car attacked him, . killing his guards and a local official in 2007. Emergency: An ambulance shifting injured victims of the bomb blast targeting governor of Logar province, stand outside the hospital, in Pul-e-Alam . Killed: Governor Arsala Jamal was the sole fatality in the blast in the capital of Logar province, Pul-e-Alam city . Darwish . said the bomb had been planted inside the mosque and detonated . remotely. Police initially said a suicide bomber had been responsible. A . group supporting Afghanistan's administrative development said it . suspected Jamal's work to get the Aynak copper mine in Logar province up . and running was the reason he was killed. 'Jamal... had done considerable work for the excavation of copper at the Aynak . mine,' the Independent Directorate of Local Governance agency said in a . statement. 'These activities were not acceptable to the enemies of the country and that is why they martyred him on the first day of Eid al-Adha,' it said. It did not elaborate on who it thought was behind the attack. Jamal spent part of his life in Canada, where his wife and two children continue to live. Taliban insurgents fighting to expel foreign forces have stepped up attacks on government targets ahead of the withdrawal of foreign combat troops by the end of 2014. The Taliban have rejected government calls for peace talks and have denounced a presidential election due in April as illegitimate. Investigation: Afghan security forces inspect the entrance gate of a mosque where Logar governor Arsala Jamal was killed . Cause: No-one claimed responsibility for the attack earlier today . A Chinese consortium is running the Aynak mine under a massive deal agreed in 2007. It is Afghanistan's largest foreign investment project but Taliban attacks on the site have prevented work from getting going. The Chinese investors in August demanded a review of the deal, putting the project at risk. Production was originally scheduled to start this year, but now is seen as unlikely before 2019. The Taliban's elusive leader, in a message to mark the Eid holiday, urged his fighters to step up their fight against the government. 'My advice to all mujahideen is to stand up to the enemy firmer than before,' Mullah Omar said in the message, distributed via email, referring to Muslim holy fighters.","Arsala Jamal was governor of Logar and a friend of Afghan president .

Authorities in Pennsylvania are to file criminal charges against three students involved in a brutal beating on a school bus on Wednesday - and the bus driver who did nothing to stop the attack and didn't allow the two victims to flee from the vehicle. Police in Chester acted after they viewed video posted onto Facebook that shows one student on the Delaware County Alternative High School bus allegedly hitting 17-year-old Dylan Fonner in the face repeatedly. The grainy video which shows Fonner's face being bloodied, lasts seven minutes and was posted on the Facebook page belonging to one of the alleged offenders and was tagged to the second alleged offender, both 16, as well as the 16-year-old girl they were with on the bus. Scroll Down for Video . Beating: Dylan Donner is punched by the outstretched arm and fist that can be seen here in the middle of this grainy video filmed by one of the alleged attackers on the bus in Chester, Penn . In addition to the beating on Fonner, the three alleged attackers also hit his friend CJ Buonadonna once and both he and Fonner claimed that after the attack, which the bus driver did not stop, all three retreated to the back and watched their video. Pictures provided by Jackee Fonner, Dylan's mother show the 17-year-old with a swollen and cut lip, a bruised nose and three chipped teeth. Bleeding: Dylan Fonner's nose can clearly seen to be dripping with blood and the floor also (right) after he was punched repeatedly on his way home . Painful: Dylan Fonner's face is cut up from the alleged attack he experienced on the way home from school last Wednesday in Chester, Penn . Inaction: The bus driver can be seen at the top left hand of the screen - it is alleged that the driver did nothing to stop or intervene during the beating on Wednesday . Their neighbor, Judy Blair told CBS Philly that she was stunned the bus driver did nothing to intervene. 'Why didn’t the bus driver, I can’t understand how he can sit there and see this happen and not put a stop to it? I know things happen on a bus but kids will be kids but this went too far, it really did.' While the three attackers, not the bus driver have been identified, Dylan's mother said she was appalled at the inaction from the only adult at hand as her son was beaten. 'Very frustrating and very angry because our children are supposed to be safe and now it’s not only do you have to worry about your child being safe in school but now you have to worry about the bus ride too,' Dylan’s mom said to CBS Philly. Outraged: Dylan's mother Jackee Fonner said that she wanted charges pressed and the role of the driver examined . Appalled: Chester City Police Commissioner Joseph Bail says that if a grown up was present it is unacceptable for them not to have intervened . 'He didn't even give my son a cotton ball to clean the blood off of him, my son had to use his flannel shirt to clean his face off. He just did absolutely nothing,' Jackee Fonner said to ABC 6. Chester Police Commissioner Joseph Bail confirmed to CBS Pilly that police detectives are in the process of filing criminal charges against three students and the bus driver. Buonadonna said that he suspected the assault was because of an argument that began earlier in the day at school for children with behavioral issues during his wood shop class. 'It started about three minutes into the drive,' said Buonadonna to the Delco Times. Both Buonadonna and Fonner said that they have both been bullied before by the same two students.

Top solicitor: Helen Dugdale, 44, who is a partner at DDE Law who specialise in drink-driving cases, was banned from the roads for 18 months . A solicitor who specialises in defending 'loophole-style' motoring cases was banned from the road herself after being caught drink-driving in her Mercedes. Helen Dugdale, 44, was arrested in her own driveway after a passer-by spotted her driving erratically and called police. The single mother wiped her eyes with a handkerchief at Manchester Magistrates Court today as she pleaded for a lesser driving ban claiming it would have a detrimental effect on her family life and 'dent' her reputation. Dugdale - a partner at a Liverpool law firm who regularly defends clients facing traffic charges - was disqualified for 18 months, fined £800 and ordered to pay £650 costs. She must attend an awareness course for convicted drink drivers. 'I don't intend to say anything about the offence itself - your line of work you know all about it,' district judge James Prowse told her. 'It has cost you your good character. The submissions made to me don't fall on deaf ears. I'm aware that the disqualification will hit you harder than most people. 'You and must attend a drink drivers awareness course. As somebody of previous good character you are an ideal candidate. I remind everybody of the serious consequences of driving whilst disqualified.' Dugdale is a partner at Castle Street-based solicitors DDE Law and has worked as a solicitor on Merseyside for around 20 years. She has helped a number of the region's charities with free independent legal advice. On the DDE Law website she is described as having a 'niche speciality' in motoring law with a 'vast knowledge' of dealing with drink driving cases. She also specialises in representing clients accused of serious crime including murder, manslaughter and driving offences, and one of her cases was featured on the late-1990s BBC TV documentary Mersey Blues. Dugdale generally covers cases from the Knowsley area and frequently represents clients at Liverpool and Knowsley magistrates' court. She also carries out work on cases where police seek to recover assets. The incident occurred on July 12 after a member of the public saw Dugdale coming out of Schmooze Wine Bar in Allerton, and walking to her dark grey Mercedes. Mr Roger Brown prosecuting said: 'The witness was concerned that she was staggering and holding on to the car in order to move herself along. The witness was so concerned that they telephoned the police.' Police traced the owner from the registration plate and arrested her at her home in Mossley Hill, Liverpool. 'I don't intend to say anything about . the offence itself - your line of work you know all about it,' - District Judge James Prowse . On arriving they saw Dugdale on the drive smelling of alcohol and noticed the car's engine was warm, along with other signs that it had recently been driven. She failed a breath test and was asked to step into their patrol car. When tested, Dugdale had 76 microgrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath. The maximum legal limit is 35mg. Dugdale initially denied drink driving but pleaded on the day of trial. Her barrister Mr Harpreet Sandhu said in mitigation: 'She has been entirely co-operative. In so far as aggravating factors in this driving there is nothing. 'As far as the disqualification period is concerned she is somebody who will be badly affected both personally and professionally. 'She knows she has nobody to blame but herself. But she is a single mother to an eight-year-old child and she has an elderly and ill mother who lives in very close proximity and is reliant on her. 'She has lost her good character and there will be a sizeable dent on her reputation.'","Helen Dugdale, 44, was spotted driving erratically after leaving a bar .

A woman has been sent to prison after conning her best friend out of her life savings by pretending that she was dying of cancer. Devious Tracey Pascall told trusting couple Wendy and Andrew Petford that she was dying of lung cancer to avoid paying back £4,500 she had borrowed. Pascall had befriended Mrs Petford when they both attended teaching training college in the late 90s, and the pair were reunited when Pascall got back in touch via Facebook in February 2011. Former friends: Tracey Pascall, left, was sentenced to two years in prison after conning best friend Wendy Petford out of £4,500 by pretending she had cancer . Reunited: Pascall and Mrs Petford had met at teacher training college and became reacquainted when Pascall got in touch via Facebook in 2011 . After meeting up she asked to borrow money from Mrs Pascall, claiming she was waiting for funds to clear on her account. To back up her claims Pascall forged letters, claiming she had £54,000 in a Post Office account. After months of avoiding returning the cash Pascall developed a persistent cough and told the couple, of Telford, Shropshire that she had lung cancer in order to delay their requests for the money. It was only when Mr Petford went with her to the solicitors that the letters were revealed as fake and the police were called. Behind bars: Tracey Pascall was sentenced to two years in prison after she admitted 19 dishonesty offences . Pascall appeared at Shrewsbury Crown Court on September 16 this year, when she was sentenced to two years in prison after admitting to 19 dishonesty offences. It emerged that she had previous convictions for fraud dating back to 1990, including forging cheques from her own daughter. Speaking after the sentencing, Mrs Petford, 47, said: 'She said I’d get the money back and I never doubted her for a second. 'We were very close at college. She called me Blossom and we did everything together. 'To say she had cancer, that’s lower than low. The only thing that keeps me going is knowing she won’t get to spend Christmas with her grandchildren.' 'When we were younger we told each other everything and I used to see her every day. We were part of a big group, but we spent a lot of time together. 'She got back in touch and we went for a drink. Tracey ordered a bottle of champagne. That was her all over - she was always glamorous and I never saw her in the same clothes twice.' The pair were so close that Mrs Petford didn’t need to think twice about lending her best friend money in May 2011. 'At first I thought Tracey said £300, but it turned out she said £3,000,' said Mrs Petford, who added that she had been forced to leave her job due to stress. 'She told us she was just waiting for some money to clear, and had a letter to prove it. It said she had £54,000 in her account. Marital strife: Andrew, left, and Wendy Petford had to focus on the wedding of their daughter Michaela, pictured with baby Olivia, to husband James to take their mind off the stress caused by Pascall's fraud . 'I didn’t think about it at the time, but why did she have the letter with her? Why did she need to prove it?' At first the couple asked for their money back once a week, but the court was told that Pascall had always had an excuse, along with a letter from the bank or solicitors to prove it. She was then said to have developed a persistent cough before announcing she was dying from lung cancer, prompting the Petfords to stop pressuring Pascall for the money. A month later, in November, Mr Petford went to meet Pascall to collect a cheque from the solicitors. Mrs Petford said: 'Andrew said he would go with her, not to try and catch her out, just because he thought it would be easier. I didn’t realise until afterwards but she looked panicked. 'He got there and was told there was no cheque, and when he showed them the letter they said it wasn’t one of theirs. Happier times: Mrs Petford and Pascall during their time at teacher training college together . Blast from the past: Pascall, left, and Mrs Petford shortly after meeting in the 1990s. Mrs Petford described Pascall as 'glamourous' and said she never wore the same clothes twice . 'They had to call the police. Andrew came home and told me. That’s when the realisation hit home. If that letter’s forged, are the others? 'The next day the police called us and us and asked us to go down. We took all the letters.' The forgeries were so convincing that even the police were not sure immediately if they were real or not. Mr and Mrs Petford instead focussed on organising their daughter Michaela’s wedding to take their mind off things. Mrs Petford said: 'The wedding was supposed to have been in 2013, but when Michaela sets her mind on something she always wants it done straight away. 'We had three weeks to prepare the wedding, and without the money it was going to be tough, but we wanted to get through. 'Originally they were going to deal with it all themselves. They were going to go to a pub for the reception, but it was a very small pub. They wouldn’t even be able to get us all in there. Convincing: Mrs Petford said that Pascall had shown the couple forged letters from banks and solicitors to back up her claims . 'We decided that because we had nothing but bad luck, hurt and pain that we wanted to do it better than the pub. 'We scraped together, and although it wasn’t the big wedding she should have had, it was still a wonderful day.' Michaela married her fiancee James Corfield on December 9, 2011, at The Lord Hill Hotel in Shrewsbury. After appearing in court, it emerged that Pascall that she had previous convictions for fraud dating back to 1990, including forging cheques from her own daughter. Mrs Petford said: 'It makes me so angry - I want her to get the maximum sentence of three years. We’re appealing for her to get longer. 'It broke me apart. I was off work with depression and had to leave my job. I’m too scared to go outside alone now. 'She never even said sorry.'","Tracey Pascall tricked pal to avoid paying back borrowed money .

Murdered: The body of Janet Gilson was in the bottom of her niece's sofa four days after she was reported missing while on holiday in Hong Kong . A murdered former Salvation Army worker was found dead inside a sofa after her family noticed drops of her blood on the floor, an inquest has heard. Janet Gilson, 64, was strangled days after she arrived on holiday in Hong Kong after travelling there to visit relatives. Ms Gilson, from Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, was missing for four days before family members spotted blood on the floor close to a sofa. They called police who found her body hidden in a hole cut out of the bottom of the piece of furniture, Chelmsford Coroner's Court heard. Ms Gilson was reported missing on March 15 2011 having arrived in the Far East 10 days earlier. But it wasn't until March 19 that her body was found at the home of her niece Julia in Lamma. A post-mortem confirmed that Ms Gilson had died of suffocation, but coroner Yvonne Blake refused to read out further details of the report because it was deemed 'too distressing' for family and friends who had attended the inquest to hear. She recorded a verdict of unlawful killing, adding: 'I understand Janet Gilson was a Salvation Army worker who did a lot of good work. 'It is very tragic her life was taken in this way.' Speaking after the inquest, Ian Payne, 55, a former Salvation Army officer from Bromley who attended with his wife Judith, paid tribute to his friend and colleague. He said: 'Janet was one of those one in a million people. 'She had a unique ability to connect with people and had a huge impact on all our lives. 'It is difficult to put into words all her good qualities. 'She was the true embodiment of what a Christian should be. 'We went to Hong Kong for the trial - in some ways today gives us a sense of closure but she will always be a part of our lives.' Grim discovery: The body of Major Gilson, 64, was found hidden at her niece's home in Lamma, the third largest island in Hong Kong, in March 2011 . Janet set up one of Russia’s first ever Salvation Army churches after travelling alone to the outskirts of Moscow and learning the language in the early 90s. Throughout her 40-year career with the Salvation Army she also worked with teenagers in England and Ireland. She had retired shortly before leaving for Hong Kong. Ahmed Fareed, reportedly the ex-husband of Ms Gilson's neice, was found guilty of the murder at the High Court in Lamma in June this year and jailed for life. The court had heard that she had been strangled with a rope and was found with a towel stuffed in her mouth and four broken ribs. Fareed, from the Maldives, was arrested at Hong Kong’s ferry harbour shortly after the murder. Following the court case, Ms Gilson’s niece, Julia, told the South China Morning Post: 'To those people that are in relationships with violent partners: I strongly urge you to get away. 'I made the mistake of believing I could help change my ex-husband, giving him many chances. 'I realise the error of that judgment now and hope that others can also learn from that.'","Janet Gilson, 64, went missing ten days after arriving in Hong Kong .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 08:40 EST, 15 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:49 EST, 15 October 2013 . Former Liberian President Charles Taylor has been flown to Britain to serve his 50-year sentence for sponsoring atrocities in Sierra Leone's brutal civil war. The Special Court for Sierra Leone announced that the 65-year-old warlord-turned-president was put on a chartered plane to Britain on Tuesday, where he was turned over to prison officials. Britain's offer to enforce any jail sentence, which could cost tax-payers up to £80,000 a year, was crucial for his trial to go ahead in the Hague, justice minister Jeremy Wright said when it was announced the UK would impose his sentence. Convicted: Former Liberian president Charles . Taylor, left, at the Special Court for Sierra Leone for his . appeal judgment at The Hague this month, where judges confirmed his 50-year . sentence for crimes against humanity . Taylor was convicted in April last year of 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including terrorism, murder, rape and using child soldiers. He . aided murderous rebels in Sierra Leone's 11-year civil war that ended . in 2002. His conviction and sentence were upheld on appeal last month. Taylor always maintained he was innocent. The controversial decision to send Taylor to Britain was announced earlier this month following his failed appeal against his convictions - which made him the first former head of . state convicted by an international court since Nuremberg trials of Nazi . leaders after the Second World War. After the announcement, Mr Wright said: 'The conviction of Charles Taylor is a landmark moment for international justice.' The court's ruling came more than a decade after Taylor helped rebels go on a murderous rampage across war-torn Sierra Leone, raping, murdering and mutilating tens of thousands of innocent victims. Taylor had aided and abetted crimes . committed by Revolutionary United Front and Armed Forces Revolutionary . Council rebels, while knowing well the kinds of crimes they were . committing. Presiding Judge . George Gelaga King said: 'Their primary purpose was to spread terror. Brutal violence was purposefully unleashed against civilians with the . purpose of making them afraid, afraid that there would be more violence . if they continued to resist.' Charles Taylor aided rebels in Sierra Leone during a brutal civil war in the 1990s which left 50,000 people dead. Thousands more were left mutilated in the conflict that became known for the extreme cruelty of rival rebel groups who hacked off the limbs of their victims and carved their initials into opponents. Taylor helped to plan attacks in return for 'blood diamonds' mined by slave labourers in Sierra Leone and political influence in the volatile West African region. He was convicted not only of aiding and abetting Sierra Leone rebels from Liberia, but also for actually planning some of the attacks carried out by Sierra Leone rebel groups, the Revolutionary United Front and the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council. The trial opened in June 2007 in The Hague. Taylor boycotted the initial proceedings and dismissed his legal team. He pleaded not guilty to all 11 charges. Witness testimony began in January 2008, and ended in November 2010. Closing arguments took place in February and March 2011. The court heard live testimony from over 90 prosecution witnesses, and received written statements from four additional witnesses. The defence presented 21 witnesses. Court hearings included testimony from supermodel Naomi Campbell about a gift of diamonds from Taylor. 'Governments . and the international community were also afraid that unless the RUF . and the AFRC demands were met, thousands more killings, mutilations, . abductions and rapes of civilians would follow.' Taylor was sentenced to 50 years in jail in May last year, and the Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL) dismissed the appeal and confirmed the sentence on September 26 this year. The head of the SCSL then requested that Taylor now be transferred to a prison in the UK to serve his sentence. In a statement to MPs today, Justice minister Mr Wright said: 'The United Kingdom’s offer to enforce any sentence imposed on former President Taylor by the SCSL was crucial to ensuring that he could be transferred to The Hague to stand trial for his crimes.' The International Tribunals (Sierra Leone) Act was backed by all parties in 2007 knowing it could mean Taylor would serve his sentence in the UK with the taxpayer picking up the bill, he said. 'International justice is central to foreign policy. It is essential for securing the rights of individuals and states, and for securing peace and reconciliation. 'The conviction of Charles Taylor is a landmark moment for international justice. It clearly demonstrates that those who commit atrocities will be held to account and that no matter their position they will not enjoy impunity.' During Taylor's four-year initial trial, judges heard accounts from Sierra Leone civilians who had been mutilated by rebels or who had seen their close relatives murdered. They also heard evidence from supermodel Naomi Campbell, who was questioned about blood diamonds Taylor was accused of having sent to her hotel room. She described the objects she received as looking like 'dirty pebbles.' The court found Taylor provided . crucial aid to rebels in Sierra Leone during that country's 11-year . civil war, which left an estimated 50,000 people dead before its . conclusion in 2002. Thousands . more were left mutilated in a conflict that became known for its . extreme cruelty, as rival rebel groups hacked off the limbs of their . victims and carved their groups' initials into opponents. The . rebels developed gruesome terms for the mutilations, offering victims . the choice of 'long sleeves' or 'short sleeves' - having their hands . hacked off or their arms sliced off above the elbow. Prosecutors . said he used the proceeds from so-called blood diamonds mined in the . conflict zone to finance Taylor's activities, which included advising . and helping the rebels. 'Dirty pebbles': Naomi Campbell is seen holding the bible being sworn in at the Special Court for Sierra Leone, where she was questioned about blood diamonds Taylor was accused of having sent to her hotel room . Civil war: In this June 10, 1997 file photo, soldiers from the Revolutionary United Front supported by Taylor ride in a pick-up truck at their base on the outskirts of Freetown, Sierra Leone . Morris Anyah, Taylor's lead . defence lawyer, complained that Taylor had been prosecuted because of a . lack of friends in high places. Referring . to the diplomatic row over action against the regime in Syria, Mr Anyah . said: 'But for two powerful nations, two members of the Security . Council - Russia and China - Bashar Assad would have been charged and . indicted by the International Criminal Court. That is not happening . simply because of political reasons. 'Had . Charles Taylor had as friends any of the five permanent members of the . Security Council ... this case I dare say would probably not have had . the sort of traction it had.' Because . Syria is not a member of the International Criminal Court, only the . Security Council asking the court to investigate could trigger . jurisdiction there. The reaction back home: Men gather at a popular downtown Monrovia tea shop known as a hotspot for political debate to watch the announcement of today's appeal verdict . And Taylor's supporters in Liberia remained loyal to the former warlord who was later democratically elected the country's president. The very idea of international courts has come under fire across Africa. The ICC has been accused of neo-colonial meddling in Kenya as it pursues cases against its president and deputy president. 'This is complete international gangsterism,' said Cyril Allen, former secretary general of Liberia's National Patriotic Party. 'The ICC was set up for Africans, to intimidate them and get their resources.' Taylor's brother-in-law Arthur Saye said he was not surprised by the verdict. 'From day one my position has been that the trial of Mr Taylor was orchestrated by the powers that be - the Western powers,' he told the Associated Press. 'This was an international conspiracy.' Several African states are considering withdrawing from the ICC, which has only ever prosecuted Africans.","Former Liberian leader convicted on 11 counts of war crimes .

This archaeological dig less than a mile from Stonehenge has found early Brits feasted on frog's legs 8,000 years BEFORE the French . They might seem the epitome of French cuisine, but the English were feasting on frogs' legs up to 8,000 years before the French acquired a taste for them, archaeologists have claimed. A charred toad's leg has been discovered alongside fish bones at a site just one mile away from Stonehenge in Wiltshire and is the earliest evidence of a cooked toad or frog anywhere in the world, scientists said. The leg dates to between 6,250BC and 7,596BC - some 5,000 years before the prehistoric monument was built - and eaten 8,000 years earlier than the French and Czechs were documented as enjoying the delicacy, which they claimed as a national dish. Archaeologists unearthed the leg alongside small fish vertebrate bones of trout or salmon as well as burnt aurochs' bones (the predecessors of cows) at the Blick Mead dig site near Amesbury. David Jacques, senior research fellow in archaeology at the University of Buckingham, said: 'It would appear that thousands of years ago people were eating a Heston Blumenthal-style menu on this site, one-and-a-quarter miles from Stonehenge, consisting of toads' legs, aurochs, wild boar and red deer with hazelnuts for main, another course of salmon and trout and finishing off with blackberries. 'This is significant for our understanding of the way people were living around 5,000 years before the building of Stonehenge and it begs the question - where are the frogs now?' The latest information is based on a report by fossil mammal specialist Simon Parfitt, of the Natural History Museum, who examined the discoveries from the dig which has resulted in 12,000 finds, including 650 animal bones, all from the mesolithic era. A charred toad's leg has been discovered alongside fish bones at a site just one mile away from Stonehenge (pictured) in Wiltshire and is the earliest evidence of a cooked toad or frog anywhere in the world, archaeologists said . Dr Jacques said it would appear people were eating a Heston Blumenthal-style menu near Stonehenge thoudands of years ago, including toads' legs, (frog's legs are pictured) Mr Jacques said that he hoped the discoveries would help confirm Amesbury as the oldest continuous settlement in the UK. The site includes one of the biggest collection of flints and cooked animal bones in north-western Europe. Andy Rhind-Tutt, chairman of Amesbury Museum and Heritage Trust and co-ordinator of the community involvement on the dig, said that the studies at Amesbury could help explain why Stonehenge was created. He said: 'No one would have built Stonehenge without there being something unique and really special about the area. 'There . must have been something significant here beforehand and Blick Mead, . with its constant temperature spring sitting alongside the River Avon, . may well be it. 'I . believe that as we uncover more about the site over the coming days and . weeks, we will discover it to be the greatest, oldest and most . significant mesolithic home base ever found in Britain. Currently . Thatcham - 40 miles from Amesbury - is proving to be the oldest . continuous settlement in the UK, with Amesbury 104 years younger. 'By the end of this latest dig, I am sure the records will need to be altered,' he added.

A Washington state jury has convicted a man accused of strangling his wife to death in 2006 and dumping her body in the woods. David Pietz was found guilty Monday of second-degree murder in the death of 32-year-old Nicole Pietz. Prosecutors say David Pietz, 36, tried to cover up his wife's death by reporting her missing. Her nude body was found about a week later. Scroll down for video . Emotional scene: Martin 'David' Pietz, right, is taken from court Monday in Seattle after a jury found him guilty of murdering his wife, as her sister, Tonia Zurcher, left, yells, 'You're going to hell, Pietz' During the Monday hearing, members of the victim’s family wept openly in the courtroom when the guilty verdict was announced following a day and a half of deliberations. Pietz was arrested in March by cold case detectives who had spent six years building a case against him based largely on circumstantial evidence. January 28, 2006: Nicole Pietz, 32, reported missing by her husbandFebruary 6, 2006: Her naked body found in the woods near Burien, WashingtonFebruary 12, 2006: Memorial service held for Nicole PietzMarch 2012: David Pietz arrested and charged with second-degree murderSeptember 12, 2013: Murder trial begins in SeattleOctober 8, 2013: Defense and prosecution rest their casesOctober 14, 2013: Jury reaches guilty verdict . Prosecutor Kristen Richardson later told the press that in the end, the case hinged on minor clues, including Pietz's alleged affairs with at least four different woman and his wife's mouthguard, which she was wearing when her naked body was found in a wooded area near Burien, The Seattle Times reported. During closing arguments last Thursday, Richardson told the 12 members of the jury panel that Pietz had grown tired of being married to Nicole because of her reluctance to pursue a more adventurous sex life, and was 'cold and callous.’ In the course of the trial, four women testified they had sexual relations with Pietz while he was married to Nicole. One of the husband's alleged lovers told the court last month that the 36-year-old defendant regularly spiked his wife's drinks with ecstasy to get her to take part in threesomes. Pietz’s defense lawyer said the defendant was wrongly accused and that prosecutors failed to establish a motive or come up with hard evidence such as DNA or witnesses to the crime. ‘Dave Pietz isn’t the first guy to step out on his spouse,’ attorney David Allen told jurors Wednesday. ‘Is it a motive to kill his wife? He had bad boundaries; he’s oversexed.’ On trial: David Pietz is accused of murdering his wife after prosecutors claim he was unhappy in their marriage . Killed: Nicole Pietz, 32, was found dead in February 2006. She is pictured with her husband, David Pietz . The defense built its case on Nicole . Pietz's history of addiction to painkillers and claimed that the . 32-year-old woman suffered a relapse after eight years of sobriety and . disappeared while out looking to score drugs. However, . toxicology reports showed only trace amounts of prescription pills in . Nicole's system and no signs of recent drug abuse. Pietz, . 36, showed little emotion beyond beads of perspiration glistening on his brow when . the guilty verdict was announced at around 2pm Monday. He faces between . 10 and 18 years in prison when he is sentenced at a later date. Emotions . ran high in the King County courtrhouse, where the victim's relatives . and friends sobbed with relief in reaction to the verdict. Nicole . Pietz's sister Tonia Zurcher yelled out, 'You're going to burn in hell, . Pietz,' as he was led out of the courtroom following his conviction. ‘I . just wanted justice for my daughter and we got it,’ said Nicole’s . mother, Gael Schneider. ‘These last 7 1/2 years have been torture for . us.’ Miss Schneider then added, 'She'll never come back, we got justice for her, but I'll never get to hold her again,' the station KING5 reported. Scene: Her body was found in a wooded area in 2006. Police said evidence suggested she had been killed at night - not in the day as Pietz suggested - as she still had her night mouth guard in . Search: Investigators search their home after the disappearance and remove their computer . For years, there were no charges . brought in connection with the murder - until police arrested Pietz, 36, . last year and charged him with second-degree murder thanks to advances in . technology. Detectives were initially interested in Pietz as a suspect after learning that he was unhappy in his marriage and now they say they have built a case on circumstantial evidence. Pietz, who had been married to his wife for four years, was finally arrested earlier in March 2012 after DNA and phone GPS linked him to the crime scene, police said. Investigators claimed there were contradictions in his statements and he failed a lie detector test before refusing to undergo a second. Mr . Pietz told police that on January 27, 2006, he got home from work around . midnight and briefly said goodnight to his wife, who was already . sleeping, KOMO reported after his arrest. Emotional: Earlier this week, Gael Schneider, Nicole Pietz's mother, unleashed an emotional rant when she came face-to-face with the accused killer in court . Cover? in 2006, Pietz had appeared on television beside Schneider pleading for information in the case . The next morning he said left for work at 8.30am without speaking to Nicole and had no contact with her throughout the day. Mr . Pietz told police that he called 911 when he went straight to a planned . dinner with friends that night and his wife never arrived. He claims that she must have vanished as she headed to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting that morning where she was going to celebrate 8 years of sobriety. He claimed that he believed she had fallen back into her old drug habit. However, police said that forensic . tests - including undigested food in her stomach - showed that Mrs Pietz . had been killed around midnight on January 27. When . her body was found, she was wearing a mouthguard she only wore at . night and her wedding ring was in cleaning solution in the bathroom; . friends said she only took it off at night to clean it. Loss: Investigators believe the couple was having marital problems and that Mr Pietz had cheated on his wife . Phone records also show her phone was allegedly used at her husband's workplace. And . DNA evidence showed that Mr Pietz's was the last person to drive her . car, which was found two weeks after her body in a parking lot near the . University of Washington.

When state patrol troopers responded to the crash scene, they found Mrs Nordhagen gripping her husband's hand. 'You don’t see that every day,' Trooper Rob Spencer told KREM. 'We actually had to ask her to let go of him, so we could get him out of the car.' Loss: Floyd Nordhagen, 92, and Margaret Nordhagen, 88, were holding hands in a car wreckage when troopers arrived on the scene on Sunday. The couple both died from their injuries . In love: Friends said it was right that the couple, who had been married for 68 years, died together as they had done everything together in life. Floyd often boasted about how pretty his wife was, they said . The couple both passed away at the scene. The two passengers in the pick-up truck were not injured, although a dog was thrown from the vehicle in the impact and he was found to be unharmed. Friends and family said that although the deaths were tragic, they were relieved to know that the couple, who were from Chattaroy, had died together - as this is how they had lived their lives. A friend of the Nordhagens, Britches Peden, said: 'I don't know if they were holding hands before he passed, or if she grabbed him afterward but it doesn’t matter. 'They would have been holding hands if they could. so that's the way we all want to remember them.' Friends added that Mr Nordhagen, who owned a farm and ranch land and reared cattle, always bragged about how pretty his wife was, and told them he made sure to kiss and hug her every day.

A farmer has created purple, green and orange varieties of cauliflower in a bid to get more people eating vegetables. The 'rainbow' caulis are part of Andrew Burgess' plan to improve the diets of people across the country by making the vegetables more appetising. The 48-year-old has set aside a small patch of land in Peterborough to grow his experimental vegetables - which took him years to develop. Bright idea: Farmer Andrew Burgess has created three colourful varieties of cauliflower - called Grafitti, top, Ortoli, left, and Vitaverde, right - in a bid to get more people eating vegetables . The weird and wonderful creations, which are all organic, are made by cross-breeding ancient varieties. All of the hybrids were hand-pollinated by Mr Burgess, who farms 15,000 acres in total. As well as brightening up everyday dishes, the colourful vegetables are also healthier than regular cauliflowers. The purple variety, called Grafitti, is packed with antioxidants while the orange ones, called Ortoli, contain carotene - a form of vitamin A that encourages healthy skin. The green variety, Vitaverde, is a hybrid cauliflower with similar features to broccoli and so is high in vitamin C and fibre. Mr Burgess, who is director of agriculture for his family business Produce World, said: 'We started off growing the coloured cauliflowers for show. 'The purple and the green varieties . tasted just like normal cauliflower but then we found the orange ones . had a really nutty flavour. Long process: The organic vegetables are created by cross-breeding ancient varieties and were all hand-pollinated by the farmer - who said the colourful varieties took years to develop . 'We created the colours by cross-breeding. We pick out the various traits we want, then hybridise the variety to make sure they are stable. 'It takes a long time to develop different varieties though - some can take up to five years to get right. 'The cauliflowers are grown over half a dozen plots in the test field, which works out about a quarter of an acre. 'Next year I will step up the orange cauliflowers with the hope that they could be on supermarket shelves in the near future. 'One idea we had was to sell the caulis ready floreted, perhaps as a mixed colour bag. Unusual: The purple Grafitti cauliflower, pictured, is packed with antioxidants . Weird and wonderful: The green variety, Vitaverde, left, is similar to broccoli and is high in vitamin C. The orange variety, called Ortoli, right, is nutty in flavour and contains carotene that encourages healthy skin. 'There are health and taste benefits but also it's about making food a bit more fun. 'Growing is a passion for me. I enjoy my job so much it is more like a hobby - I love to discover new things. 'Every other year I take a trip to a different part of the world in search of new ideas and new varieties. The cauliflower is a member of the Brassica oleracea species - which also includes broccoli, cabbage, brussels sprouts and kale. There are hundreds of varieties of cauliflower  - which is grown around the world. The unusual vegetables were originally developed for show, but Mr Burgess soon realised they could be produced on a mass scale. The colours are created by cross-breeding. The farmer would pick out a desired trait in a variety and would then breed that with another to create a hybrid product. Although it sounds reasonably straight forward, it can take a long time to develop - with the farmer saying it can take up to five years to get right. Mr Burgess grows the cauliflowers over half a dozen plots in a test field, which works out about a quarter of an acre. He hopes the orange variety - with its distinct nutty taste - will be in supermarkets within the year. 'If I see something I like that I think might work I bring it home and experiement with it in the trial field - it's like my playground. 'If I think we can grow it successfully we will try maybe an acre and if that goes well we will scale it up. 'The idea behind the trial field is to change people's perceptions of vegetables. 'If we ate a healthier diet with more vegetables we could save the country millions of pounds but we have to convince people to do that. 'Our ultimate goal is to try to create healthy, appealing vegetables that people want eat more of.' The cauliflower is a member of the Brassica oleracea species which also includes broccoli, cabbage, brussels sprouts and kale. There are hundreds of varieties of cauliflower being grown around the world. The vegetable is known for being low in fat and carbohydrates but high in vitamin C and dietery fibre. The Burgess' farming business produces 500,000 tonnes of vegetables each year and employs 1,000 staff. Mr Burgess is the latest in a long line of farmers in the family, who started growing vegetables in 1898. The Produce World company boomed in the years following the Second World War as the nation emerged from rationing.

Freda Pickering with daughter Carol Davis, who she has recently been reunited with after giving her up for adoption at birth . An amazing coincidence saw Freda (left, 83) and Carole (right, 65) ride the same bus every day for seven years while Carole was at school, with neither knowing of their connection . Each day young Carole caught the same bus to get to school - and Freda was the conductor. Mother and daughter were within feet of each other on a daily basis for seven years without either knowing who the other was. They only realised how close they had been when mother-of-two Carole finally tracked down Freda in 2005. Widowed Freda said: 'It’s unbelievable to think that we were so close to each other for all the years Carole was at school. 'I don’t think I would have said anything even if I had known because I had to wait for Carole to make the first move. 'It’s nice to think that I was a part of her life when she was younger when I thought I wasn’t. Carole, pictured as a school girl, rode the same bus as her birth mother through-out her childhood . 'My husband Ron and I couldn’t have children, and that’s the only thing I regret is not having a family. 'But now I have a big family - Carole has two children and grandchildren so now I’m a great-grandma. Freda, pictured here in her bus conductor uniform, had Carole when she was just 19 years old . 'It’s marvellous, I’m very happy at how it’s all turned out.' Freda worked as a bus conductor between 1945 and 1982 and regularly worked with her late husband Ron who was a bus driver. She added: 'I worked on the school buses which ran to Tadcaster Grammar every day. 'Ron drove the bus. We both could have seen Carole every day for all those years - it’s incredible.' Freda, who lives in Collingham, West Yorks, was found by Carole in December 2005. Carole had been adopted age five by Tom and Dorothy Freedman, and went on to train as a teacher before marrying in 1970, aged 21, and having two children. She subsequently divorced and has since remarried. Carole was living in Dudley, West Mids, with her children Michelle and Paul and it was Michelle who found Freda’s brother Gordon online. Carole got in touch with a letter which said: 'Before you start reading this letter, I suggest that you make yourself a cup of tea, and sit down in your best comfy chair. Freda's late husband Ron Pickering worked with her on the bus. The couple were unable to have children of their own . Wetherby bus station where Freda worked on the buses between 1945 and 1982 . 'No, it’s not bad news, but it is information that may shock and surprise you and be emotional for you. 'My name is Carole Davies, born on 05/12/1948. My birth was registered on 06/01/1949 in Wetherby, and I believe that you are my mum. 'I was adopted by Tom and Dorothy Freeman when I was aged five. 'I have always known that I was adopted. 'I don’t really know why you were unable to look after me, but whatever the reason, I believe you did what you thought was best, or had to do, at that time. 'I do not blame you, I am not angry with you, and I have always understood that it must have been a difficult and emotional choice that you had to make. 'However, I realise that this letter, coming like a bolt from the blue, must be a terrific shock to you, and understand that you may not want to see me at all, and for all sorts of reasons.' Freda said: 'As soon as I read the letter I picked up the phone and rang Carole. 'It was so strange hearing my daughter’s voice. After all, I never knew what she sounded like before.' Speaking today Carole said: 'My mum asked me if I went to Tadcaster Grammar School and said ""Did you used to get the school bus?"" 'I replied 'Yes, twice a day' to which mum said 'I was the bus conductor'. 'I had absolutely no idea that the lady who checked my bus pass twice a day was my mum. 'It was a complete shock when we began talking about our past and my school life, and that was mentioned.' She added: 'My adopted brother had found his family and I thought it was about time I found mine. My daughter had found a missing persons' website and uploaded information up of who I was. 'I tried to find her myself but got absolutely nowhere. 'However, my daughter amazingly got a response from someone who looked up family ancestry as a hobby. 'I . used 192.com to trace a number for the name I had, and the nerves I had . were unbelieveable. I can remember feeling anxious, sick, not knowing . if my mum would pick up. The letter Carole wrote to Freda in 2005, telling her she was her daughter . 'I asked ""Is it Freda?"", she replied 'Yes, is this Carole?' and I said ""Oh hello mum!"". 'We phone each other when we can and go up to see her as much as I can. It has been amazing to spend the lost birthdays and Christmases together. 'I don't remember anything about the bus conductor, and all along it was my mum. It's incredible how we've been able to find each other.' Carole’s father was a Croatian exile who married another woman after a brief relationship with Freda. Freda recalled: 'I was 19 at the time and I didn’t know where babies came from. 'One night I got this pain in my tummy. I thought babies had to be cut out of you but all of a sudden this baby dropped out. 'My mum was in the next bedroom and I went to her and said ‘Mum, I think I’ve had a baby’. 'I named her Carole because it was around Christmas time when she was born and I thought it was appropriate. 'Carole was a month or so premature so she had to stay at the hospital for a while. 'Every Saturday I would go up to see her and I was allowed one day visit when I brought her home, but the decision was made that she would be adopted. 'I knew that it was what had to happen, so although I wished I could keep her, I knew there was nothing I could do. 'Over the years I always thought about her, where she was living, whether she worked, whether she was married. 'I would have loved to see her but didn’t know how to get in touch. 'Now it’s lovely to be in contact again. 'Carole works so she can’t come and see me as much as she’d like, but we speak on the phone every few days and she comes to see me often.'","Freda Pickering, 83, gave birth to Carole, now 65, in 1948 when she was 19 .

Heat-sensitive cameras on board West Midlands Police’s helicopter picked up unusually high temperatures seeping from the walls of the high-rise home in Nechells’ South Tower in Birmingham. The ‘glowing’ light is a tell-tale sign of cannabis production because the plants require high heat and light to grow. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . A general view of the block of flats in Nechells in the day (left) and the image picked up by the thermal imaging camera which was on board West Midland's Police's helicopter .

Benjamin Edwards, 28, was given a two-year prison sentence suspended for 24 months when he admitted cannabis cultivation at Birmingham Crown Court last Friday. He was also ordered to attend a three-month drug rehab course, made a subject of a two-year supervision order and told to pay £100 costs. West Midlands Police Deputy Air Operations Manager Martin Knowles said: 'The crew were heading back from a search in the Solihull area when they noticed a clear heat source at a flat in Nechells.

'Our thermal cameras can detect unusually high temperatures coming from properties several thousand feet away - anyone growing cannabis on a commercial scale, using rows of heat lamps, runs the very real risk their criminality will be rumbled from the skies.' The den was caught on camera just after 10.30pm on May 2 this year as the helicopter made its way back to Birmingham Airport after providing air support in the search for a wanted man in Acocks Green.

A British soldier was killed in a firefight in Afghanistan today - the first UK death for nearly six months. The serviceman, from 14 Signals Regiment (Electronic Warfare), died while taking part in a daring mission to disrupt insurgents and destroy weapons and bomb-making equipment. He was on patrol with the elite Brigade Reconnaissance Force in Helmand Province when he was fatally wounded by gunfire. Casualty: A British soldier on patrol with the elite Brigade Reconnaissance Force in Helmand Province was killed today (file picture) A military spokesman said the soldier was 'the brightest and the best' who had heroically 'died defending his comrades'. Next of kin have been informed. A total of 445 UK personnel have now died since operations in Afghanistan began in 2001. It is the first British death in the warzone since three soldiers - Corporal William Savage, Fusilier Samuel Flint, and Private Robert Hetherington - were killed when their Mastiff armoured vehicle hit an improvised explosive device (IED) on a routine patrol on April 30. The latest soldier lost his life while supporting the Afghan National Security Forces on a mission near Kakaran, north east of provincial capital Lashkar Gah. The number of UK troops taking part in patrols has significantly reduced since last year as responsibility for ground operations is handed to the Afghan army and police. This means fewer Coalition forces are placed in danger before combat operations cease at the end of 2014.

Despite receiving immediate medical attention, he died from his injuries at the scene, said the Ministry of Defence. The victim had been in Afghanistan 'a matter of weeks' after deploying with 7th Armoured Brigade, known as the Desert Rats, which took over command of the British mission in Helmand.

'Those who served alongside him were privileged and feel his loss most deeply. Our prayers and thoughts are with his family at this extremely difficult time.' The role of 14th Signal Regiment (Electronic Warfare) includes locating the enemy's communications and disrupting them by jamming electronic systems and preventing them from working properly. The troops of 7th Armoured Brigade are expected to do little fighting on the nine-month tour - three months longer than usual - as Afghan forces take the lead on all operations. Part of its job will be the closure of bases around Helmand and the return of equipment to the UK. Patrol Base 2 (PB2) was the last to close this year and only five bases remain into 2014, including Camp Bastion. The British presence in Afghanistan will be almost halved by the end of this year to 5,200.","The soldier was in the elite Brigade Reconnaissance Force in Helmand .

There is no specific law preventing women from getting behind the wheel but they cannot apply for driving licences and have previously been arrested on charges relating to public order or political protest. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Women in Saudi Arabia have been defying the driving ban and are getting support from male drivers . The photos and footage show various women driving on busy streets in the capital Riyadh. One clip shows a woman driving in the traditional veil with only her eyes showing but as the footage shows men are supporting an end to the ban by giving her the thumbs-up. Activist Eman al-Najfan, known as Saudiwoman on her Twitter page, has been tweeting updates from the campaign. Another female campaigner, who asked to remain anonymous, said the publication of the video clips and photographs was the first part of a two-stage campaign designed to change attitudes towards women drivers. One of the new video clips shows a woman behind the wheel driving through Riyadh . Women will be asked to get behind the wheel on October 26 as part of the protest. She said 'to drive with a licence . should not be against the law' adding that many Saudis, including senior . officials, had become more open to the idea of women driving. 'The authorities, the country, how people think has changed,' she said. Conservative supporters of the ban, including members of Saudi Arabia's powerful clerical establishment, have said allowing women to drive will encourage the sexes to mix freely in public . which would threaten public morality. In this photo a child can be seen waving at the female driver who is banned from having a driving licence . Opponents of the ban say it means families have to employ expensive private drivers which makes it . difficult for women to work or to do many other basic daily tasks. They also point out that women in rural areas of Saudi Arabia frequently drive without being . stopped by police. A female member of the Shoura Council - a body appointed by King Abdullah to advise the government - proposed on Tuesday lifting the ban on women drivers. The council's transport committee must now decide whether to accept her recommendation and put it to the transport ministry. Her proposal was widely reported in more liberal parts of the Saudi press and some newspapers . published opinion pieces arguing that women should be allowed to drive. Earlier this month a Saudi sheikh warned that driving could affect women's ovaries and pelvises.

With its friendly face and welcoming greeting, a Japanese fridge manufacturer's new mascot was supposed to amuse visitors to the firm's website. But the egg-shaped character has caused an online outbreak of the sniggers for all the wrong reasons. Fukushima Industries says it is now considering rebranding its cute but somewhat awkwardly named mascot - 'Fukuppy'. Oops: Fukushima Industries is reconsidering the name of its mascot - Fukuppy . The bizarre character, which has wings and red shoes, has become the source of much ridicule on Japanese social media sites since he was unveiled in April. He greets visitors to the company's website with a friendly 'I'm Fukuppy. Nice to meet you.' But rather than intending to amuse or offend, the unusual moniker, which is unlikely to inspire confidence among consumers regarding the reliability of the firm's products, is meant to reflect the company's ethos. The name blends the first part of the company's name - Fuku - with the last part of the word 'happy' - reflecting Fukushima Industries' claims that it is a 'happiness creating company'. And while Fukuppy claims to be the 'scatterbrained' one, company bosses are probably regretting not putting more thought into his name. The company said in a statement that the name was mistaken for 'an inappropriate word among people in English-speaking places or its meaning was misunderstood on the Internet'. No link: The company's unfortunately named mascot bears no relation to the Fukushima nuclear plant which suffered a series of catastrophes . It added: 'We sincerely apologise for worrying many people and creating misunderstanding among them. 'We will look into the name, including a rethink of it.' The firm, which makes industrial cooling systems and has offices in China, Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Taiwan, said its name was nothing to do with the stricken Fukushima power station - though many people commenting on the mascot's unfortunate title said that such an association would be apt following the string of catastrophes suffered by the prefecture. Unusual custom: Asahikawa Prison, unveiled Katakkuri-chan as its mascot in a bid to soften the image of the jail . The clean-up at the site, where reactors flung radioactive substances into the air, soil and sea in the days and weeks after it was hit by the March 2011 tsunami, has been beset with problems, and continues to come under the spotlight. A series of leaks of radiation-contaminated water over recent months came on top of a power outage caused by a stray rat, adding to the widely held impression that the plant's operator is hapless. It is common for companies and organisations in Japan to have a cuddly mascot character that they use as part of branding. Many are brought to life by adults in full-size costumes who wander around sponsored events posing for photographs with children. In September, Asahikawa Prison in Japan's far north unveiled 'Katakkuri-chan', a 6ft 6ins humanoid with a huge square face and an enormous purple flower for hair, which bosses hoped would soften the image of the jail. Tokyo Metropolitan Police has had its own crime-fighting mascot since the 1980s who is now well-loved across the nation. The use of English, or English-derived words, is also very common in Japan, where despite many years of compulsory language schooling, standards remain relatively low. This leads to occasional hilarity among visitors to the country, who struggle to understand why someone would drink the unappetising-sounding Pocari Sweat or the off-putting Calpis. Bizarre phrases born of poorly understood English lessons frequently make their way onto t-shirts, stationery and into advertising copy.","Fukushima Industries apologised for 'worrying' customers with the name .

One in 2,000 people in the UK carries abnormal proteins linked to variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) - the human form of mad cow disease . One in 2,000 people in the UK carries abnormal proteins linked to variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) - the human form of mad cow disease, new research has shown. Experts said their study has 'important implications' for how blood and blood donations are managed and for the handling of surgical instruments. The findings suggest a 'high prevalence of infection with abnormal prion protein, indicating vCJD carrier status in the population'. But the researchers noted that, despite the higher number of carriers, just 177 vCJD cases have been reported to date in the UK. vCJD is a fatal, degenerative brain disorder which is the human form of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE). The disease is believed to have passed from cattle to humans through consumption of meat products contaminated with BSE. Large numbers of the UK population were exposed to BSE prions in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The new study, published online in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), involved analysis of more than 32,000 appendix samples from people of all ages who had their appendix removed between 2000 and 2012 at over 41 hospitals in England. Of these samples, 16 tested positive for abnormal prion protein, indicating that one in 2,000 of all people are likely to be carriers. The researchers, including a team from Public Health England, found that prion protein in those born between 1941 and 1960 did not differ significantly from those born between 1961 and 1985. Presence of the protein was also similar in both men and women. The researchers expressed concern that some of the 16 samples produced information which might suggest people may be susceptible to developing the condition over a longer time than previously thought, or may not show any signs of disease at all. But they said the number of patients diagnosed with vCJD is still well below the number suggested by the prevalence of abnormal proteins. Professor Noel Gill, lead investigator . at Public Health England, said: 'Prevalence studies such as this are . important as they enable us to interpret the impact of the BSE epidemic . on the population of Britain and strengthen the basis for ongoing risk . assessments. A scientist examining a screen with a segment of brain displayed showing the incidence of CJD on a human brain (indicated with black rings round the white cells). 177 vCJD cases have been reported to date in the UK . 'There are already extensive measures in place to prevent the potential spread of infection. 'Prion diseases can have very long incubation periods, and an understanding of prevalence can help researchers devise measures to prevent further transmission of the disease.' It is not known whether all infected individuals will develop disease. The peak of the vCJD epidemic in the UK was in 2000, where 27 probable or definite cases were diagnosed that year. Only one case of vCJD has been diagnosed in 2013 in the UK.' He said further research on samples from the 1970s and earlier - before BSE appeared - were now underway to see whether prion proteins also occurred then, which could reduce the significance of the new findings. Dr Graham Jackson, from the Medical . Research Council Prion Unit at University College London's Institute of . Neurology, said: 'While the study is much needed and offers both . confirmation and refinement of previous studies, further work is still . required. Further research on samples from the 1970s and earlier - before BSE appeared - are now underway to see whether prion proteins also occurred then, which could reduce the significance of the new findings . 'Given the high levels of infection indicated by this research It is now crucial we establish how many people in the UK harbour that infection in their bloodstream in order to adequately assess the risks of transmission through contaminated blood donations. 'Studies to develop new blood tests for CJD must remain a priority to assist with screening and protecting the UK blood supply.' Professor Azra Ghani, a reader in infectious disease modelling at Imperial College London, said: . 'The results from this large-scale survey are important in confirming the presence of a higher prevalence of abnormal prion protein compared with the 177 confirmed cases of vCJD. 'While the lack of new cases remains reassuring, these results highlight the need to maintain both case surveillance and precautionary measures to prevent onward transmission, over the coming decade.'","The abnormal proteins are linked to variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) - the human form of mad cow disease .

Passengers on U.S. planes are finding themselves in a tighter squeeze as airlines install new slimline seats that take up less space from front to back, allowing for five or six more seats on each plane. The changes, covering some of the most common planes flown on domestic and international routes, give the airlines more paying passengers and a smaller fuel bill because the seats are slightly lighter - although that may be cancelled out by the extra passengers. Some passengers seem to mind the tighter squeeze more than others. The new seats generally have thinner padding. And new layouts on some planes have made the aisles slightly narrower. Uggh: Frequent fliers say air cabins are tight enough already but United, Southwest and Alaska Airlines are now fitting slimmer seats to squeeze in more passengers . Whether the new seats are really closer together depends on how they are measured. By the usual standard, called 'pitch', the new ones are generally an inch closer together from front to back as measured at the armrest. Airlines say passengers will not notice. The seats going onto Southwest's 737s have thinner back magazine pockets. Alaska Airlines will have slightly smaller tray tables. United's new seats put the magazine pocket above the tray table, getting it away from passengers' knees. And seat-makers saved some space with lighter-weight frames and padding. This allows airlines to claim that passengers have as much above-the-knee 'personal space' as they did before, even if the seats are slightly closer together below the knee. Sittin' pretty: The new seats are slimmer so they are being fitted closer together . Out with the old: The newly designed seats will mean an extra row of five or six passengers can be squeezed in at the back . New seats going into United Airlines' Airbus A320s are an inch closer from front to back. The new seats . Southwest has put on nearly its entire fleet are 31 inches apart, about . an inch less than before. In both cases, the airlines were able to add . an extra row of six seats to each plane. International passengers are feeling crowded, too. As recently as 2010, most airlines buying Boeing's big 777 opted for nine seats across. Now it is 10 across on 70 per cent of newly-built 777s, Boeing says. The extra seat has generally meant narrower aisles, and more knocks from the drinks trolley for those at the end of the row which is the biggest complaint from travellers according to Mark Koschwitz of SeatExpert.com. 'We used to recommend the aisle seats, because you could stretch out more,' he said. He now tells passengers who want to sleep 'to bring a jacket and prop up against the window'. United, Alaska and Southwest Airlines in the U.S. are all buying into the slimmer, closer together seats option .","United, Alaska and Southwest Airlines are all opting for more seats .

A four-year-old boy is lucky to be alive after he was kicked in the head by an untethered horse. Lewis Harrison was with a friend in a playground metres from his home in South Bank, Middlesbrough, on Friday when the unsecured horse kicked out at him. The little boy was rushed to hospital with blood streaming down his head having suffered a serious wound. Injury: Lewis Harrison, four, was playing with a friend in a play area in . South Bank, Middlesbrough, when an unsecured horse kicked out at him - leaving him with a wound to the head, pictured . Hospital staff told his mother Melissa Bird - who is now calling for parents to be more aware of the dangers of horses - that her son had been lucky not to be killed. Lewis, who attends Teesville Primary in the town, was playing at South Bank Park when he approached the small white horse and stood behind it. Ms Bird, 28, said: 'I was in the house when his brother Lee came in screaming ""mam, it’s Lewis, his head is gashed open"". Then I saw him coming towards me, blood streaming down.' She said staff at the James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough, where her son was taken, were very concerned about the nature of the injury. She said: 'They said that if he’d been struck an inch away from the spot he was kicked, or if he’d have been kicked straight in the eye socket, he’d have been killed. 'And if he’d been standing directly behind the horse, rather than slightly to the side, he wouldn’t have stood a chance. Dangerous: The family say the horses, pictured, were roaming next to the playground in an open public space often used by children . Appeal: Lewis' mother Ms Bird, pictured next to the playground in South Bank, Middlesbrough, has said more parents should be aware of the dangers of unsecured horses . 'I could have been planning my son’s funeral today.' Ms Bird stressed the horses were walking free on a public open space, always used by children. She . said: 'Lewis knows not to go behind the back legs of a horse, but . that’s when a grown-up is there. But horses shouldn’t be there on a . playing field - it’s as simple as that.' Thankful: Ms Bird said if Lewis had been hit in the eye he would almost certainly have died . A spokesperson for Coast and Country Housing, which manage Redcar and Cleveland Council homes and land, said: 'We deplore the irresponsible actions of horse owners who are allowing their animals to roam in public areas including those where children play. 'We take the issue of stray horses very seriously and have been working with fellow members of the local Joint Equine Group to tackle the problem. 'We would urge members of the public to report stray horses, and any information about their owners, to the police.' A spokesman from Redcar and Cleveland Council said: 'Initially we issue warnings and in the Greater Eston area these warnings have led to more than 300 instances of illegally tethered horses being removed from council land. 'If these warnings go ignored we will consider enforcement action and to date we have instructed bailiffs to impound 15 horses. The council does not tolerate irresponsible owners illegally grazing their horses on its land.' A Cleveland Police spokeswoman said the force 'strongly supports' the Joint Equine Group initiative and remains 'committed to tackling the problem of tethered and untethered animals.'","Lewis Harrison was in a playground near to his home in South Bank, Middlesbrough, when he approached the unsecured animal .

Major League Baseball umpire Wally Bell has died of a suspected heart attack aged just 48. Bell, who worked the Nl playoff series between the Pittsburg Pirates and the St. Louis Cardinals just a week ago, had been feeling ill over the weekend and was scheduled to see doctors on the same day he died. The father-of-two had quintuple bypass surgery in February 1998 and his father also survived two heart attacks before dying. Scroll down for video . Wally Bell (left) has died aged just 48 following a reported heart attack at his home in Ohio. He leaves behind a girlfriend, Renee, and two teenage children . He is reported to have suffered a massive heart attack at his home in Youngstown, Ohio. In a statement commissioner Bud Selig said: 'All of us at Major League Baseball are in mourning tonight regarding the sudden passing of Wally Bell. 'I always enjoyed seeing Wally, who was a terrific umpire and such an impressive young man. On behalf of our 30 clubs, I extend my deepest condolences to Wally's family, fellow umpires and his many friends throughout the game.' According to Bell's biography on MLB.com, his proudest moment as a big league umpire was returning to the field after having open heart surgery. Two of his arteries had been 100% blocked, two more had been 80% blocked and another 70%. Bell came back for a game in San Diego and plate umpire Mark Hirschbeck took the first ball out of play and kept it as a souvenir for Bell. Bell worked the 2006 World Series and three All-Star Games, including this year's event at Citi Field, where he was stationed at first base. A veteran of 21 big league seasons, he also had worked four league championship series and seven division series since joining the major league staff in 1993. The umpires for Game Three of the NL Championship Series at Dodger Stadium heard about Bell's death an hour before they took the field. Gerry Davis, crew chief for the series, commented that the game was tough but they had to focus and remind themselves that Wally would have wanted the game to go on. The Los Angeles Angels went on to beat the St Louis Cardinals 3-0. In action: Wally (centre) watches home plate during a game between the New York Mets and the San Diego Padres in San Diego in 1998 . After the game Davis added: 'It was a devastating loss for us. Wally was a true umpire's umpire. I think if you'll check with the players and teams they felt the same way because Wally always gave 110 percent on the field.' Several players from around the majors expressed their condolences on Twitter including Dodgers catcher A.J. Ellis, who wrote: 'Wally kept game fun and loose and I always looked forward to catching with him behind plate. I will miss his personality and professionalism.' Meanwhile Toronto slugger Jose Bautista remembered Bell for his banter, saying: 'He always had great spirits on the field, i will always remember how he teased me about my beard.' Finally, Red Sox outfielder Shane Victorino commented: 'My thoughts and prayers go out to the family of Wally Bell. So sad to hear (and) will remember him tomorrow as I take the field.' Bell is the first active MLB umpire to die since John McSherry passed away of a heart attack on the field in Cincinnati on opening day in 1996. Joe Torre, MLB executive vice president for baseball operations, also offered his condolences, saying: 'I am deeply saddened and shocked at the loss of umpire Wally Bell. 'Umpiring was his life, and he touched so many people within the game of baseball. Aside from being an accomplished, All-Star-calibre umpire, Wally was a loving dad to his two teenage children. 'I extend my deepest condolences to them, his girlfriend Renee, the rest of his family and his admirers across Major League Baseball.'","Wally Bell had been a Major League Baseball umpire since 1993 .
