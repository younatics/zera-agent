"London (CNN) -- British police said Sunday they would examine evidence suggesting that celebrity chef Nigella Lawson took cocaine. The news came days after Lawson's two former personal assistants were cleared of fraud in a trial that saw the chef admit to occasionally using drugs including cocaine. In a statement on Sunday the Metropolitan Police said a specialist team would examine ""all the evidence emerging as part of a review into this matter and in conjunction with the Crown Prosecution Service, will determine an appropriate way forward."" However, police added that there was ""no imminent prospect"" of a prosecution being mounted against Lawson. ""The Senior Investigating Officer received legal advice that the witness's admissions did not by themselves provide sufficient evidence to bring charges."" On Friday Lawson spoke out angrily against what she said were false claims of habitual drug use made against her in the trial of sisters Elisabetta and Francesca Grillo. Francesca Grillo had been accused of defrauding Lawson and her ex-husband Charles Saatchi of $950,000 (Â£580,000), and Elisabetta Grillo of defrauding them of $172,000 (Â£105,000). Both denied the charges. The case gripped UK media, thanks to revelations of drug use by Lawson and insights into her troubled marriage to Saatchi, a millionaire art collector. The couple divorced this year. At the trial, both sisters claimed to have seen signs of repeated cocaine and cannabis use by Lawson. However, both testified that they had never seen her take drugs. Saatchi likewise said he had never seen his ex-wife use drugs. Elisabetta Grillo told the court that Lawson had smoked cannabis with her two children from her marriage to her first husband, the late John Diamond. In her own testimony, Lawson confirmed she had taken cocaine half a dozen times, during two periods of her life, and used cannabis in the past. But she denied being a habitual user. Lawson, who was a prosecution witness, said she was ""disappointed but unsurprised"" by the verdict. She slammed what she said was a sustained campaign to ruin her reputation. ""Over the three week trial the jury was faced with a ridiculous sideshow of false allegations about drug use which made focus on the actual criminal trial impossible,"" Lawson said in a prepared statement. ""My experience as a witness was deeply disturbing. When false claims about habitual drug use were introduced I did everything possible to ensure the (Crown Prosecution Service) was aware of the sustained background campaign deliberately designed to destroy my reputation.""","UK police to examine evidence that celebrity chef Nigella Lawson took cocaine .

"(CNN) -- Thousands of Ontario, Canada, residents made do without power Monday in the aftermath of storms that toppled trees and brought down power lines. Meanwhile, residents in the upper Midwest prepared for bitter cold wind chills. More than 300,000 customers remained without electricity Monday across Ontario, including 200,000 in Toronto, officials reported, in the wake of what Mayor Rob Ford called one of the worst ice storms to hit the city. Still, the city was functioning and conditions were ""not even close"" to warranting an emergency declaration, he told reporters Monday. Toronto Hydro CEO Anthony Haines said major power lines are being restored at a rate of one every few minutes, but street-to-street work remains, and he couldn't offer a guarantee everyone will have power by Christmas. ""My caution continues to be my caution. Let's really plan for the worst,"" Haines said Monday evening. ""I am encouraged in the progress we have made today, obviously, with well over 100,000 customers being restored today."" Ford said 100 trucks from other cities were on their way to Toronto to help restore power to more people. Toronto had opened more than a dozen warming centers some were expecting up to 300 people, officials said. In the United States, areas that had been as warm as the 70s on Sunday began a slide into frigid territory as Canada sent some of that cold air sliding across the eastern United States. Dangerously cold wind chills were on tap in parts of Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri and Illinois. Wind chill warnings were posted for parts of Minnesota, warning of of wind chills as low as 45 below zero. Still, the picture was much calmer than over the weekend, when storms left at least 10 people dead. At least five people died in Kentucky floodwaters, two people died in Mississippi storms, and one person died in a traffic accident during Missouri's severe weather, officials said. A weather-related wreck Saturday near Wichita, Kansas, left one person dead, according to CNN affiliate KWCH-TV. And a tornado Saturday also killed a woman in Arkansas, CNN affiliate KARK-TV in Little Rock reported. The tornado was one of two rated at EF2 to hit the state on Saturday. Northeast: Hot and cold . New York City set a record high Sunday at 71 degrees, National Weather Service meteorologist Ashley Sears said. The previous record, set in 1949 and matched in 1998, was 63. But temperatures will fall each day until Wednesday, and by Christmas, New York might not even reach the freezing mark. And in northern New England, another round of snow and ice is set for Monday, the National Weather Service said. Southeast: When it rains, it pours . Rain was finally tapering off in Georgia, South Carolina and states in the Mid-Atlantic. A wave of cold temperatures will take its place Tuesday. Temperatures will likely be 10 to 15 degrees colder than normal on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. Midwest: Ice and dangerous wind chills . The storms left some Michigan residents dealing with no electricity. Sara Hadley's family lost power after an ice storm struck her hometown of Lansing. She sent photos of some of the countless icicles in her neighborhood. ""Last time we had ice like this was 1998,"" Hadley told CNN's iReport. Pacific Northwest: Another storm brewing . Coastal and valley rain as well as mountain snow is in the forecast through Tuesday, the service said. Higher elevations could get dumped with 6 to 12 inches of snow. CNN's Sean Morris, Adam Shivers, Todd Borek, Jareen Imam, Leslie Holland and Janet DiGiacomo contributed to this report.","NEW: Power restored to 100,000 customers in Toronto, electric company official says .

"(CNN) -- West Ham United will ban fans for life if they are found to have aired anti-Semitic chants during their English Premier League clash with Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday. The English Football Association (FA) has confirmed they have launched an investigation into chants from the stands during the match at White Hart Lane. Tottenham have strong links with London's Jewish community and it is alleged West Ham's supporters sang songs about Adolf Hitler and referred to an incident last week which saw several Spurs fans stabbed in Rome. West Ham confirmed two of their fans had been cautioned by police for ""racially aggravated gesturing"" on their official website. ""One of those fans has since been identified as a season ticket holder and has, this afternoon, been sent a letter containing a banning order from the club,"" they said. ""Any other individuals identified can expect a similar swift and robust response."" It is the latest racism storm to engulf England's top flight, after recent high-profile cases involving Chelsea captain John Terry, who was banned for racially abusing an opponent. Last week Chelsea's complaint of racist language towards one of their players from Premier League referee Mark Clattenburg was dismissed by the FA due to a lack of evidence. A statement on the FA's website read: ""The FA Governance Department has this morning contacted both clubs and will continue to make enquiries into the matter in the coming days. ""We note the statement issued by West Ham United FC and encourage clubs to identify and ban for life any individuals involved in incidents of abusive chanting. ""There is no place for anti-Semitism or any form of discrimination in football. The FA is committed to working with the clubs, Leagues, fans groups, the police, CPS and community stakeholders to play our part in addressing this unacceptable behavior."" West Ham's Israeli midfielder Yossi Benayoun took to micro-blogging site Twitter to express his dismay at the chanting. He wrote: ""I have a great relationship with the West Ham United supporters, from my first spell at the club and again now I am back on loan here, this why I was very disappointed to hear some of the songs yesterday and it was embarrassing. ""But we need to remember that it was made by a minority group of fans and I'm sure the FA together with West Ham United football club will do everything to find and punish them."" Ahead of Tottenham's Europa League clash with Lazio in Rome last week, a group of their supporters were attacked while drinking in a bar in the city center. During the match Lazio's fans were alleged to have sung anti-Semitic songs, prompting Tottenham coach Andre Villas-Boas to call on European football's governing body UEFA to act. Lazio were fined $50,000 in October over racist chanting towards a trio of Tottenham players who are black. The FA called on UEFA to sanction Serbia after another Tottenham player, Danny Rose, was reported to have been subjected to monkey chants while on duty with England's under-21 team. Tottenham's close association with the Jewish community has led to some of their fans to identifying themselves as ""Yids"", a term which at different times throughout history has been used by Jews and also to abuse them. A portion of the Spurs' support have attempted to ""reclaim"" the word, using terms like ""Yiddo"" and calling themselves the ""Yid Army."" Peter Herbert, chairman of the Society of Black Lawyers, who referred Chelsea's complaint over Clattenburg to the police, said they were prepared to do the same for this incident. He told CNN: ""We're in discussions with the Metropolitan Police, I understand the FA have already reported it which they should do with such incidents. ""There has to be zero tolerance, if these people can be identified they should be prosecuted and banned from football. ""We've been in conversation with the Met Police this morning and we're waiting for a few more complaints to come in from the Jewish community and we'll make the formal complaint that this should be investigated as a racial incident."" West Ham vowed to track down and ban any more of their supporters who were at fault during Sunday's match. ""West Ham United are in contact with Tottenham Hotspur to assist them with their investigation into the conduct of a small number of supporters and alleged inappropriate chanting during yesterday's match at White Hart Lane,"" a statement read. ""The majority of West Ham supporters went there and supported their team in the proper fashion. They were let down by a tiny minority. ""West Ham United will take the strongest possible action against any of their supporters, including enforcing life bans from the club, that are found guilty of behavior which is categorically not condoned by West Ham United.""","West Ham United vow life bans for any fans found guilty of inappropriate chanting .

"(CNN) -- Philip Chism, 14, pleaded not guilty Wednesday to murder, aggravated rape and robbery charges in connection with the killing of his high school math teacher, Colleen Ritzer. The Massachusetts teenager is accused of killing Ritzer, 24, on October 22 in the girls' bathroom of Danvers High School with a box cutter he had taken to school. In Wednesday's Superior Court hearing, Chism -- wearing khakis, a blue sweater, a white shirt and tie -- was ordered held without bail; his next court date was set for 2 p.m. on January 30. During the 11-minute hearing, he sat quietly, his hands cuffed in front of him. According to a police affidavit unsealed last month, a ninth-grade student told investigators that Chism became visibly upset when Ritzer spoke after class on the day of the crime about his home state of Tennessee. When Ritzer noticed that Chism was upset, she changed the subject, said the unidentified student, who described Chism as ""talking to himself."" Denise Regan, Chism's public defender, has declined to comment. The affidavit includes testimony from witnesses as well as a school video surveillance timeline showing Chism and Ritzer in the same area of the school during the teacher's final moments. In the video, Ritzer appears to enter a second-floor girls' restroom -- apparently a faculty restroom was occupied -- and Chism, wearing gloves and red sweatshirt with the hood pulled over his head, appears to enter the restroom about a minute later, according to the affidavit. Shortly after, a female student enters the bathroom and then quickly walks out, according to the court papers. She told investigators she saw the back of a person who appeared to be changing clothes; the person's rear was exposed, with clothes piled on the floor. The video shows Chism leaving the restroom, returning later with a recycling barrel, and again leaving the restroom pulling the barrel -- this time with a black mask on his forehead, the court papers say. He pulls the barrel outside the building and toward the student parking lot. Investigators said the video shows what appear to be blood stains near the bathroom and on Chism's pants. After Chism was reported missing by his mother on the evening of October 22, police had his cellular phone company ""ping"" the location of his phone. The phone was found to be in the vicinity of the Hollywood Hits Theater, where investigators learned the teen had purchased a movie ticket and then left. The affidavit said that, when Chism was spotted by a police officer the next day, he was carrying a knife; a search of his backpack turned up a bloodstained box cutter. Asked where the blood came from, Chism allegedly responded: ""The girl."" He was also allegedly carrying credit cards and driver's licenses belonging to Ritzer, as well as a pair of woman's underwear. The armed robbery indictment alleges that Chism robbed Ritzer of credit cards, an iPhone and her underwear. Police discovered Ritzer's body in a wooded area near the school, covered with leaves and debris in an apparent attempt to conceal it, the court papers said. Her throat was slit. Court papers detail horrifying final moments of teacher's life . The green recycling bin seen in the surveillance video was found 20 yards from the body. Clothing and other belongings were scattered near the body, along with the blood-soaked gloves Chism appeared to have been wearing in the video. The handwritten ""I hate you all"" note was folded near her body, according to the documents. Investigators used the affidavit to secure a warrant to search Chism's home. Chism's mother, Diana, told investigators that she had recently moved to Massachusetts from Tennessee amid a ""stressful divorce"" from the teen's father. Friends, relatives bewildered by arrest of 'storybook kid' in teacher slaying . Documents filed 12 years ago in a Tennessee court shed light on a troubled relationship. The court papers showed that Chism's father agreed during a separation from his mother to have restricted time with his son, who was then 2, because of ""prior physical and emotional abuse as well as alcohol abuse."" Chism's uncle, Terrence Chism Blaine, told CNN that the boy's parents are separated and that the father -- a former military man -- lives in Florida. On the aggravated rape and armed robbery indictments, Chism was charged as a youthful offender, but prosecutors said they would move to join those charges with the murder case in Superior Court.

"(CNN) -- In an attempt to reduce open street prostitution and to improve security for sex workers, Switzerland's largest city, Zurich, is opening ""sex drive-ins"" Monday. The nine garage-style structures, located in Sihlquai, a former industrial zone in the city, are equipped with alarm buttons and guarded by security personnel to ensure the safety of the prostitutes. Customers are not allowed to leave the area with the sex workers. Read more: Brazil drops 'happy being a prostitute' ad campaign . ""Prostitution has escalated in the city,"" said Michael Herzig, from the Zurich social services department. ""It was done out in the open on the street and men harassed passers-by. ""It was noisy and dirty because men took the prostitutes to a side street and left used condoms on the streets. The drive-ins are more discreet and safer."" Herzig leads the project, which has cost 2.4 million Swiss francs ($2.6 million) to set up. ""The project is extremely controversial. Prostitution is about morals and religion. But we leave these things aside and see it as a business. The humanitarian aspect is more important for us,"" said Herzig. Around 30 to 40 women are expected to work at the site each night. Sex workers have to pay 5 Swiss francs per night to make use of the so-called ""sex boxes,"" but customers don't have to pay an entrance fee. Read more: Ahead of Brazil World Cup, free English classes planned for prostitutes . The drive-ins are open daily from 7 p.m. to 5 a.m. and can only be accessed by car. Drivers have to follow a clearly marked route to get to the area, where customers and sex workers can discuss the services offered and agree on a price. The client can then drive into the allocated box, where the service is provided. There are also showers, toilets, a kitchen and washing machines for the women to use, as well as an advice center where they can seek help from social workers. A gynecologist comes in once a week to offer health checkups for the women. The city's social services department is running the whole operation and also offers crash courses in German and self-defense courses for the women on site. ""All of this will enhance the sex workers' living and working conditions,"" Herzig said. Prostitution and consumption of paid sex are legal in Switzerland. Prostitutes are considered self-employed and are liable for taxation. ""We are trying to promote the independence and self-determination of the sex workers,"" he said. ""It's not a unique concept. We went to Utrecht in the Netherlands and Cologne and Essen in Germany, where similar projects exist, to speak to organizers. In Utrecht it's been successfully implemented since 1986."" As well as backing from the authorities, the project in Zurich has a democratic mandate: A referendum was held in March 2012, with 52% of voters in favor.","Sex workers will operate from garage-style structures with alarm buttons and guards .

"(CNN) -- A cruise ship returned to Charleston, South Carolina, on Friday after more than 400 passengers got sick during a trip to the Caribbean. The Celebrity Cruises' ship Mercury ended a voyage marked by an outbreak of a gastrointestinal illness that sickened 435 of 1,838 passengers, said Cynthia Martinez, a company spokeswoman. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, said the outbreak was the result of norovirus, which can spread from contact with contaminated food or drink, by touching objects infected by people who are already sick, or through close contact with people who are infected, the agency says. Norovirus is a common cause of viral gastrointestinal illness outbreaks on cruise ships, the CDC says. So far this year, three such outbreaks have occurred on cruise ships that docked at U.S. ports, according to the CDC. And in 2009, norovirus was the cause of two outbreaks on the Mercury, the CDC reported. The outbreaks reported and investigated by the CDC infected at least 3 percent of the people aboard cruise ships carrying at least 100 passengers on cruises lasting between three days and three weeks. The Mercury left Charleston last week for the eastern Caribbean. In addition to sick passengers, at least 32 crew members became ill, Celebrity Cruises has said. Symptoms included upset stomach, vomiting and diarrhea, the cruise company said this week. The sickened passengers and crew responded well to over-the-counter medicine, it said. A doctor and two nurses joined the cruise medical staff Monday to help deal with the outbreak when the ship stopped in Tortola in the British Virgin Islands, the cruise company said. Guests who were in isolation during the cruise received compensation in the form of a credit to their onboard account, Martinez said Friday.","Celebrity Cruises' ship Mercury returns to Charleston, South Carolina .

"(CNN) -- Sergio Perez was announced as Force India's new driver Thursday, but is the Mexican racer already getting itchy feet? The 23-year-old lost his drive with McLaren less than a month ago and Perez is determined to prove he deserves another chance with a front-running Formula One team. ""I learned a lot at McLaren last year,"" Perez, who last year finished 11th in the drivers' championship, told CNN. ""McLaren made me a better driver than I was before I joined them. I learned a lot and I'm really looking forward to proving myself in 2014; achieving great things, good results. ""Hopefully we can have a strong car and confirm once again to top teams that I'm the right one for them. ""Hopefully I can do that and have another chance in a top team in a winning car."" For now, the Mexican's immediate future lies with Force India, the British-based team who were ranked as 2013's fifth fastest team before the introduction of new Pirelli tires halfway through the season saw their early season form fade. The team, overseen by Indian tycoon Vijay Mallya, finished sixth in the team standings with German Adrian Sutil and Scotland's Paul di Resta at the wheel, both of whom are now without a drive in F1. Next season sees Perez partner highly-rated German Nico Hulkenberg, who is returning for a second stint as a Force India driver. ""I'm happy now that I know what I'm doing for next year,"" said Perez, who took three podiums for Sauber in a breakthrough 2012 season that helped earn him a step up to McLaren as Lewis Hamilton's replacement. ""I'm very excited to join a young team full of energy, full of hunger to prove itself. ""Nico is one of the best drivers out there, there's no doubt about it. He's still looking for a great opportunity for his future and it's the same for me. ""I think we are one of the strongest driver lineups on the grid."" Mallya insisted neither of his 2013 drivers had done anything to warrant the axe but that that the time had come for a change. With a major technical rule change on the horizon in 2014 and a smattering of new rules, which include a dose of double points at the season finale in Abu Dhabi, the Indian businessman believes he has chosen the right duo to drive forward a new era for his team. ""I'm very, very happy with our driver lineup,"" Mallya told CNN. ""I couldn't have done better than Nico and Sergio. ""I've always backed those drivers who have exceptional talent and who are basically gutsy and hungry and Sergio certainly fits that bill. ""I watched him at Sauber and he did an excellent job, no surprise that McLaren picked him up. ""I saw at times what Sergio did to my own drivers on the track and I said that this guy meets the criteria I'm looking for, exceptionally talented, quick and he has fire in his belly."" Hulkenberg has some history with the team, joining them as a reserve in 2011 before being promoted to a race seat in 2012. The 26-year-old then joined Sauber as Perez's replacement last season. Despite the German being a known quantity, Mallya insists he will not be the team leader in 2014. ""There is no number one or number two or senior and junior, they should have healthy competition amongst themselves,"" he insisted. But, if Perez wanted an extra incentive to prove his talents when the new season beings in March, then his new boss might have given it to him. ""Nico Hulkenberg, I have a huge amount of respect for his talent,"" Mallya mused. ""One day I think he will be world champion.""","Sergio Perez to partner Nico Hulkenberg at Formula One team Force India in 2014 .

"(CNN) -- Nearly 600 soldiers have been disqualified from being Army sexual assault counselors, recruiters and drill sergeants for a variety of infractions that mean they cannot serve in those positions of ""trust,"" according to an Army official. The 588 disqualifications come as the result of an internal review, conducted by the Army at the behest of Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, that began last August. The disqualifications were first reported by USA Today, which found that the troops involved were barred as a result of ""infractions ranging from sexual assault to child abuse to drunken driving."" This development came the same day a Senate Armed Services subcommittee held a hearing on the impact of sexual assaults in the military. During that hearing, victims of sexual assault testified to the backlash they faced from fellow service members and commanders after coming forward and the difficulties they had in securing mental health counseling. ""Even years later,"" said retired Marine Lance Cpl. Jeremiah Arbogast, ""the constant stigmatization, personal attacks, ostracism and PTSD was never ending. Choosing death was my way of taking responsibility for my circumstances."" Arbogast survived a suicide attempt that left him paralyzed in his lower body. His attacker was discharged from the Marine Corps but did not receive any jail time. Subcommittee Chairwoman Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand is leading an effort to reform the way sexual assaults are addressed in the military and has proposed removing prosecutorial decision making out of the chain of command. ""If you listen to the survivors of sexual trauma and sexual assaults,"" Gillibrand told CNN's Jake Tapper in an interview Wednesday, ""they will tell you what needs to be done is the decision making has to be taken out of the chain of command in order to create transparency and accountability and have that decision maker be objective."" That proposal has met with resistance, notably from Gillibrand's fellow Democratic senator, Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, who introduced a competing set of reforms. Instances of unwanted sexual contact and sexual assault increased by 36% in 2012, according to a report by the military's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office. In that same time period, the number of incidents reported to commanders decreased to just 9.8% . During Wednesday's hearing, Gillibrand, D-New York, contradicted a senior SAPRO adviser, Dr. Nathan Galbreath, who said the military has made progress encouraging greater reporting since that time. ""Please do not say we're succeeding,"" Gillibrand fired at Galbreath. ""If eight out of 10 victims stay mum because they don't believe justice is possible or they fear retaliation, we are failing eight out of 10 severely.""","588 soldiers cannot be trusted in positions such as recruiters, review finds .

"Madrid (CNN) -- The ""fat one"" is about to get thinner. For the first time, big winners in Spain's annual Christmas lottery will have to pay a 20% tax on their winnings if the prize is greater than 2,500 euros, or $3,425. In Spain's deep economic crisis, the government started taxing all major lottery winnings in 2013 and expects to collect about $1 billion this year. On Sunday alone, in the annual Christmas lottery that will pay out about $3 billion in prize money, the government anticipates collecting tens of millions of dollars in taxes, the Treasury Ministry told CNN. Most of the prizes are relatively small, but the lucky ones holding part of the $875 million (640 million euro) first place prize, known as El Gordo -- ""the fat one"" -- will face the tax bite. A $27.40 (20 euro) lottery ticket that matches all the numbers of the first place El Gordo prize would win $548,000 (400,000 euros), but the winner would have to pay $109,000 (80,000 euros) in taxes, the Treasury Ministry said. Spaniards typically spend 20 euros or less to buy a share of a full ticket, trying to spread the purchase among friends or family, at the local bar or at the workplace. But Spain's economic crisis and unemployment rate, which still tops 25%, has not spared the lottery, whose intake has declined for five consecutive years, according to the Spanish Gaming Yearbook 2012-2013. The lottery officially began in 1892. Year after year, the biggest winner is the state, which keeps $1.3 billion -- or 30% -- of the entire lottery intake, which reached $4.3 billion this year. The remaining 70% is distributed for prizes.","Big winners in Spain's annual Christmas lottery will have to pay a 20% tax .

"(CNN) -- The world's most famous scientist, with his iconic wild hair, crumpled suit, and pens peeking from breast pocket, poses not in a laboratory -- but on the deck of a ship. It's a candid image of Albert Einstein in his leisure time, taken on one of many trips aboard Red Star Line vessels between Europe and America in the 1930s. Three years after this photograph was taken, the Nazis came into power in Einstein's homeland Germany, and he traveled to the U.S. on one of these huge passenger steamers for good, in a journey that may well have saved the Jewish physicist's life. The Nobel Prize winning scientist was one of 2.5 million people who sailed across the Atlantic with the boat company between 1873 and 1934 -- a quarter of them Jewish. Now their remarkable stories -- many escaping persecution in Europe and investing their savings in a better life in the New World -- have been immortalized in a new $25 million Red Star Line Museum in Antwerp, Belgium. ""The most important artifact we're showing is the actual building -- it was the control center for all third class passengers,"" said museum co-ordinator Luc Verheyen, of the renovated red brick warehouses on the Rhine Quay, which until now had been left to rot. ""Inside we have a collection of ship models, stories, pictures, letters, even a Belgian waffle iron, and the piano of composer Irving Berlin -- it shows something about what was important to people of the time."" Lifesaver . Along with Einstein and Irving Berlin -- the composer of famous songs ""White Christmas"" and ""There's No Business Like Show Business"" -- was another passenger who fled Europe to forge a successful career in the U.S. Lawyer, author and prominent feminist, Sonia Pressman Fuentes, was just five years old when her family traveled from Antwerp to New York in 1934. Today she is believed to be one of just five surviving Red Star Line passengers, and the only who attended the museum's opening last month. The daughter of Jewish Polish clothing merchants living in Berlin, 85-year-old Fuentes says she would have died at the hands of the Nazis if her family hadn't caught the SS Westernland that fateful day. ""It was a lifesaver, absolutely,"" said the mother-of-one, adding that the Antwerp authorities had planned to deport the family before they boarded the ship. ""There's no question of the role the Red Star Line played in the lives of people who escaped the Holocaust."" Historic journey . While Fuentes was too young to remember the 10-day journey across the Atlantic, her 18-year-old brother Hermann, who had convinced the family to join him in Antwerp, kept a diary of the voyage, copies of which now appear in the museum. ""My brother wrote that we were seasick the whole time,"" says Fuentes, and indeed, life on the ships was cramped and dreary for third class passengers. ""In the early years, third class passengers were in large, communal cabins without water or light. They could go outside for some air once a day,"" said Verheyen. ""But towards the end, it got a lot better and they started investing in small dormitories with six people in a room."" ""First class however, was more like a luxury hotel, with huge ballrooms for dancing."" With a third class ticket valued at around $1,300 in today's money, a laborer would have had to work 75 days to cover the cost. Third class passengers also had to undergo rigorous health checks before boarding, with anyone refused entry at Ellis Island immigration center in New York sent back at the expense of the shipping line. Passengers would take hour-long showers with hot vinegar and benzene, cleaning them of lice, while their luggage was disinfected in large steam sterilizing machines. Ship-shape . Founded by Antwerp and Philadelphia ship brokers almost 150 years ago, the Red Star Line heralded a golden era for transatlantic ocean travel, and during its heyday two vessels left for North America each week. ""People left Europe for a variety of reasons -- poverty, the rise of industrialism meant a lot of small family businesses went bankrupt, political or racial persecution, and adventurers with small capital who had heard about the prosperity on the other side of the ocean,"" said Verheyen.

"(CNN) -- Just did some power lunges. Quads getting huge. Can only speak in fragments. Because my quads are so huge. Quads. Huge. Admit it. Your favorite part of working out is actually telling people that you just worked out, especially when you can filter this information into a completely unrelated conversation. ""Dude, earlier today I swear I saw a pigeon eating a pigeon. It was insane. Happened right when I got out of the gym ... that's where I exercise. My muscles."" Deep down, for some reason, you just want people to know that your morning was spent inside a weight room, sweating, as opposed to, say, inside a bathroom, thumbing through an old Garfield book. Of course, some people don't even try to be coy about their workout brags. Instead, they flat out share their stats and results with the world via social media. And it's the worst. ""Just biked 70 miles. Time for a beer. LOL."" This is unacceptable behavior, and it needs to stop. I would do something about it, myself, but I've got a big run coming up. ""Twenty miles. LOL."" Just kidding. I don't run. It requires pants. However, in Moscow, there's a perfectly good reason for working out in public and letting everyone know without having to be one of those people. Because at the Vystavochnaya subway station, riders can now perform 30 squats in exchange for a free metro ticket. It's all a part of a promotion for the upcoming Winter Olympics in Sochi, and the Russian Olympic Committee is hoping to ""add elements of sport into daily life."" Though, to be fair, this was accomplished many years ago when the two-piece track suit legally became the country's official outfit for business casual. To earn the free metro ticket, which costs about $0.92 American, commuters have two minutes to complete their squats in front of the ticket machine's special counting camera. But you have to do all 30. No fewer. Otherwise, a bear crawls out of the machine and mauls you. In Mother Russia, failure has consequences. But, really, if you fail to do all 30, you just have to pay for your ticket. There's no reward for participation. And squats are no easy task. Right now I'm in week four of the Insanity home workout program -- see how I slipped that in there? -- and it's basically 40 minutes of squats, broken up by short moments of lashing out with profanities toward Shaun T and Tania. I cry during the 30-second rest breaks, and check my e-mail during Level 1 drills. Because ain't nobody got time for that. The point is that squats are hard, and the following activities may prove to be far more satisfying: . 1) Sleeping . 2) Eating . 3) Being trapped in a car fire . Regardless, the squat machine in Moscow will remain at the station until the beginning of December, and the Olympic Committee is planning more chances for people to get fit in public with exercise bikes that charge your phone and bus handles converted into stretchy exercise bands. So, remember Russians, drink your recovery fluid and log onto Team BeachBody dot com. And good luck with that bear.

"London (CNN) -- Strong winds and heavy rain battered Scotland and eastern England Thursday, disrupting rail and road traffic as northwestern Europe braced for heavy storms sweeping across the North Atlantic and North Sea. A truck driver was killed in West Lothian, west of Edinburgh, when his truck overturned and struck other vehicles. Four others involved in the collision suffered minor injuries, Police Scotland said in a statement. Farther south, England was facing the most serious coastal tidal surge in more than 60 years, the Environment Agency warned. Residents in some towns and cities on the Norfolk coast were evacuating. ""In some areas, sea levels could be higher than those during the devastating floods of 1953,"" the agency said in a statement, although it said the flood defenses are better now than they were then. The 1953 North Sea storm surge killed about 1,800 people in the Netherlands and more than 300 in the UK, according to the British Met Office. Gales of up to 90 mph spread across the region. In some mountainous areas, wind speeds of more than 140 mph were recorded overnight, the Met Office said. Operator ScotRail, suspended all service, as tracks were flooded or covered in debris, and motorists were advised to delay journeys. Some flights serving Scotland were also disrupted. In some cases, trees, factory roofs or giant hay bales had been blown onto rail lines. Glasgow Central Station was evacuated after debris damaged the building's glass roof, said Nick King, a spokesman for Network Rail in Scotland. The worst of the storm later passed in some areas, and train service in Scotland began to run again. ""It will be many hours yet before services return to near normal levels, and so the network in Scotland and the north of England will continue to be severely impacted by today's storm,"" British train operator Network Rail said in a statement, adding that hundreds of engineers were working to clear trees and other debris from rail lines. High winds spark power cuts . Thousands of residents were being evacuated in the Great Yarmouth area in eastern England, Norfolk police said. ""Around 9,000 properties are being visited by police officers and staff over the next few hours to advise on plans for imminent evacuation,"" police said in a statement. The strong winds also hit electricity networks. Scottish and Southern Energy said engineers had restored power to around 33,000 customers and were working to get electricity back to 48,000 more in ""extremely difficult conditions"" after the gale-force winds. ""Access is being hampered by roads blocked by fallen trees and other wind borne debris,"" it said in a statement, adding that it expected most people to have their electricity supply restored by late evening. Elsewhere, Northern Ireland Electricity said emergency crews had been working since morning to restore power to more than 25,000 homes. About 2,700 remained without electricity, it said. British Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted that he had asked his environment minister to chair a special meeting on the storm disruption, adding that he was ensuring all government departments and agencies were ""doing all they can to help with (the) storm."" Germany braces for severe storm . In Germany, the DWD weather service issued high-level warnings for northern coastal regions, expecting the storm to peak Thursday evening. It said arctic polar air would stream into the country, but spokesman Andreas Friedrich said DWD did not expect as strong wind speeds as in Scotland. ""We don't expect the storm to be as bad in Germany, however it will be a severe storm nevertheless,"" he said. He said wind speeds of up to 103 kilometers per hour (64 mph) were expected inland, rising to 140 kilometers per hour (87 mph) in the mountains. ""This is only the beginning, and the storm will pick up speed and strength throughout the day. We are expecting the peak to be tonight. ""It can be dangerous, and people should stay inside their houses, especially in the North and around the coast,"" Friedrich said. In the Netherlands, KLM said it had canceled a significant number of flights to European destinations. CNN's Saskya Vandoorne and Stephanie Ott contributed to this report.","Thousands lose power at homes in Scotland, Northern Ireland; some power restored .

"(CNN) -- It's a question that's plagued mankind for centuries -- how do you create an earthly structure worthy of the divine? Should it be a lavish building of rich materials and awe-inspiring stature, a grand gesture to the grandest of beliefs? Or perhaps a humble place of reflection, a simple sanctum bowing to a power far mightier than itself? For authorities in India, it seems bigger is better, as they have recently unveiled plans for the world's largest Hindu temple -- a sprawling, maze-like complex stretching across 190 acres. At 123 meters tall, Viraat Ramayan Mandir in Motihari district will be almost three times the height of BAPS Swaminarayan Akshardham in New Delhi, currently the world's largest Hindu temple. Featuring 18 dusky pink temples with golden spires reaching to the clouds, the mammoth building in the north west of the country will have enough seating for 20,000 people. Modern marvels . Should the dream come true, it would be a remarkable feat of engineering. And as architecture continues to develop -- both technologically and stylistically -- so too do the ways we imagine our sacred structures. A Hindu temple can now be the size of seven American football fields, if plans for Viraat Ramayan Mandir are anything to go by. At the same time, a church no longer requires a pointed roof with a steeple. It can be a black steel cube, as slick as the skyscrapers surrounding it. Or even be transformed into a concrete bunker, partially submerged from the hot desert sun. How is religious architecture morphing in a modern age? It was this question which prompted editors Lukas Feireiss and Robert Klanten to compile their book ""Closer to God: Religious Architecture and Sacred Spaces,"" which examines spectacular contemporary buildings from across the globe. ""Architecture covers a wide span across the history of mankind -- from the basic housing of the mud hut to the complex system of a medieval cathedral, all the way to a modern day skyscraper,"" said 36-year-old Feireiss, who lectures on architecture and culture at design colleges across Europe. ""Yet even now many architects see the sacred or religious building as the architectural brief par excellence, because more than any other type of building, they demand spatial and artistic coherence."" World of wonder . From minimalist Buddhist shrines that mimic the womb, to sci-fi wedding chapels resembling glowing pods, the book's sumptuous images reveal a surprising array of sacred structures built in the last few years. In the small town of Plasencia, in central Spain, an abandoned 15th century seminary has been converted into a home for retired priests -- with a playful twist. Inside Casa Sacerdotal Diocesana de Plasencia, you'll find lime-colored walls, neon crosses, whacky wheel benches, and an assortment of vintage lamps. ""The whole building was organized to watch over the lives of the young males being educated there,"" explained architect Andres Jaque. ""It was all about sacrifice, control, and austerity."" ""We completely transformed it into a building where life would be seen as a celebration -- from breakfast, to laundry, and gardening. And we did that by using colors that were related to social happiness."" While the bold design was initially met with some skepticism, it appears to have opened up the once-secretive grounds to the community. ""The challenge we face as designers isn't just about architecture, it's about religion as a whole -- what role does it play in society?"" said Jaque. Function and feeling . Indeed, not only must religious architecture evoke an otherworldly feeling -- it must also function as a community center, study area, and even business space. So how do architects tick all the boxes? ""It's quite a challenge,"" says Feireiss. ""Architecture's usual criteria of purpose, access, capacity, construction, and financial viability are simply not enough -- in religious buildings the question of meaning, image and symbol are also integral to the task."" ""What I find particularly curious and inspiring about this topic is it's inherent contradictions,"" he added. ""Religious buildings always have to bridge the gap of being literally a 'concrete' implementation of a highly abstract idea."" Sound of silence . Cast your eye across these striking photographs, and the most evocative buildings are often the most unassuming. Like the simple aluminum chapel in Chile, a warm glow emanating from its pine wood interior. Or the white cube prayer and meditation room in Sudan, bare except for two small trees inside. It's part of a growing trend in religious architecture to shy away from ostentatious iconography, and instead allow the visitor to immerse themselves in light-filled serenity. ""This concise style leaves visitors free to fill it with their own thoughts, wishes, and prayers,"" said Feireiss. ""The interplay of light, emptiness and stillness seems to express a sacred quality in these spaces."" See: World's most exquisite libraries .

"(CNN) -- Not every athlete gets to train with their heroes, but Jennifer Pinches is lucky enough to be friends with one of hers. The 17-year-old is one of the Britain's most promising gymnasts, and she is hoping to line up at her home Olympics this year with Beth Tweddle -- the first competitor from the UK to win a medal at the sport's world championships. ""She's a good mentor to me. It's really good to have that relationship with Beth,"" Pinches told CNN's Human to Hero series. Pinches has made a good start in her bid to emulate her hero, having been crowned English junior champion in 2007 before representing Britain at the 2011 World Artistic Gymnastic Championships in Tokyo, Japan. She says representing her country at London 2012 would be ""the biggest honor."" Early days . Born in a small town south of Manchester, Pinches' love for gymnastics blossomed at an early age, and she worked her way up to become English champion in 2007 when she was 13. ""I started when I was six years old after seeing some clips on the telly of a gymnast swinging around and really wanted to try it out because I had just quit ballet. So I started it at the gym and carried it on,"" she says. Heroes . Pinches met triple world champion Tweddle at Liverpool Gymnastics Club after family moved north to Cheshire when she was young. Now aged 27, Tweddle made history for British gymnastics when she won a bronze medal at the 2003 world championships, and repeated that feat two years later. The South Africa-born athlete went to an even higher level when she claimed gold in the discipline at Aarhus in 2006, and then again in Rotterdam in 2010. ""I didn't start gymnastics because of a certain hero but when I was younger I always looked up to Beth,"" Pinches says. ""And when I moved to this club she was here, so I was a bit starstruck to meet her. But obviously now we're friends and she's a good mentor to me. It's really good to have that relationship with Beth."" Pinches could also line up against another of her contemporaries -- 17-year-old Russian Aliya Mustafina, who won two golds and three silvers in Rotterdam. ""She's incredible. I've met her -- that was an honor,"" Pinches says. Favorite apparatus . Pinches trains for seven hours a day on all the disciplines that make up gymnastics, but there is one form of the sport that is her clear favorite. ""I enjoy floor the best because I like the tumble,"" she says of the discipline in which Tweddle won gold at the world championships in London in 2009. ""You get to have music on and dance with choreography. It's good to perform."" London 2012 . If Pinches needed any extra motivation, it comes with the realization that her first Olympics could also be the only one in her lifetime staged on home soil. She is so determined to make the London Games, she says everything in her life has taken a back seat. ""To get to the Olympics I have to put that full commitment in, especially this year. So I have dropped back on everything else to commit my life to achieving my goal, which is to get to the Olympics,"" says Pinches, who helped Britain qualify with fifth placing at the worlds in Tokyo last year -- the team's best performance yet. ""The biggest honor is to be representing your country at the Olympic Games, and especially in London as it would be incredible. I would be over the moon if I was chosen the compete there."" How would you define success? Pinches' best performance at an international meeting so far was a bronze in the floor discipline at a World Cup event in Scotland, but she says medals are not everything. ""Success for me is when I perform to my best potential. So, if I were picked for the Olympic team and complete my routines like I trained them with no major mistakes, that would be ultimate success for me. If medals come from that then so be it.""","British gymnast Jennifer Pinches hoping to reach her first Olympics later this year .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- More than one in five people live in extreme poverty globally, according to a new report, though China's continued economic growth has improved the lives of millions. The poverty rate in the world's most populous country fell by nearly three-quarters in the last six years, from 26% in 2007 to 7% by 2012, the report by Gallup, a U.S.-based research company, said. Such a trend is attributed to the economic reforms within the country in the last couple of decades. One particular aspect of this socio-economic success has been the rapid industrialization of the country, with a major pivot of people moving from the poorer rural areas of the country to more well off jobs in urban centers, particularly within the manufacturing sector. Improved education and healthcare have also played a role in helping many out of poverty in China. Growth factor . But China's remarkable economic growth, which has rebounded to 7.8% this quarter, up from the previous quarter's growth of 7.5% has been crucial -- though forecasts by the International Monetary Fund estimate growth will slow down in 2014, falling to 7.25%. These substantial strides by China meant overall poverty across the globe was halved from 40% to 20% within two decades, according to World Bank President Jim Yong Kim. Gallup interviews more than 2,000 people per year within China to obtain its results. Many remain in poverty . Despite China's stellar improvements, the data found that many across the globe still live in extreme poverty, which Gallup classifies as those living on US$ 1.25 a day or less. Sub-Saharan Africa was found to have the highest levels of poverty, with the majority of the population in the region -- 54% -- living under extreme poverty. The statistics in Liberia and Burundi are even more dire, with 90% of the population classed in this category. At the other end of the spectrum, the United States, Europe, Australia and New Zealand all had the most positive results, with 1% or less of the overall population in these regions living in conditions of extreme poverty. The World Bank is aiming to cut the extreme poverty rate to 3% globally by 2030. This ambitious aim means that many countries in Africa and Asia would need to slash their ""extreme poverty rates"" by over half. Gallup surveyed 131 countries and its findings were solely based on self-reported income.","Gallup report shows China growth responsible for reduction in extreme poverty for many .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Bush admitted mistakes but defended his accomplishments in the final White House news conference of his presidency Monday. President Bush addresses reporters at the White House on Monday in his final news conference. ""Clearly, putting a 'Mission Accomplished' [banner] on an aircraft carrier was a mistake,"" Bush said about how his administration handled the fall of Baghdad to U.S. troops. ""It sent the wrong message."" He termed other aspects of the U.S. invasion of Iraq ""disappointments,"" including the failure to find weapons of mass destruction and the treatment of prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison. ""I don't know if you want to call those mistakes or not, but they were -- things didn't go according to plan, let's put it that way,"" Bush said. Admitting another mistake, Bush said that he should have pursued a comprehensive immigration overhaul after the 2004 election, instead of Social Security reform. He said that Congress did not have the political willpower to tackle Social Security at the time because the program was not facing an ""imminent"" funding crisis. But Bush said plenty went right during his eight years in office, including the economy for most of his term. ""I inherited a recession, I'm ending on a recession.

"(CNN) -- Jerusalem, and Ramallah, West Bank: two crucial stops for U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in his ongoing attempt to broker peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Kerry will travel to those cities on New Year's Day to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, respectively, ""to discuss ongoing final status negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians, among other issues,"" the State Department said in a statement Saturday. This will be the ninth trip to the region for Kerry, who has said that leaders remain ""as determined as ever"" to negotiate a peace deal. He kicked off talks in July, but in November, both sides dug into their decades-old trenches and passed around blame. Israelis and Palestinians are four months into a nine-month deadline given to them by Kerry to reach a peace deal, with little visible progress. But just hours after Kerry's plans were made public, Israel announced that 26 Palestinian prisoners will be freed over the next two days. The release is part of the deal that set in place the current peace talks, Netanyahu's office said in a statement. All of the released prisoners perpetrated offenses prior to the Oslo accords and have served sentences of 19-28 years, the Israeli statement said. With direct negotiations between the two sides flailing, the United States seems to have moved into a more muscular role as mediator by presenting its own bridging proposals to the parties instead of relying on the Israelis and Palestinians to negotiate among themselves. On Kerry's last visit to the Middle East, earlier this month, talk of Iran's nuclear program took center stage. That visit was the first following the deal Iran reached with the United States and five other world powers over its nuclear program. The agreement calls for the easing of economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for increased inspections and limits on the country's uranium enrichment program, which many international analysts fear is meant for military purposes. Netanyahu has strongly criticized the agreement. As for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Netanyahu has said that security is a must. Israel has insisted its own troops must remain in the Jordan Valley, as opposed to the international troops that patrol the tense borders with Syria and Lebanon. Palestinians have rejected, out of hand, having Israeli soldiers within the borders of their own states. Palestinians have further argued that Israel has been sowing distrust by continuing the construction of thousands of Jewish settlement units on the West Bank and other land that Palestinians claim as theirs.

"(CNN) -- For years as he chased his dream, shooting hoops and racing up and down the court, professional basketball player Jason Collins wore the No. 98 jersey. It was a personal gesture, a way of remembering Matthew Shepard, a gay college student whose own dreams were ended in 1998, when he died after being tied to a fence post, beaten and tortured. But when Collins came out as the first openly gay NBA player in history, that number suddenly took on a broader significance. ""I've grown so much as an individual, I've come across so many great people, great organizations, heard so many great stories, inspiring stories,"" Collins said, adding ""... it's nice to have a positive impact on someone's else's life, and I feel like with my actions that I've had a positive impact on someone's else's life."" This week, that jersey became the top-selling one in the NBA. The NBA announced Friday that it will donate all proceeds from the sale of Collins jerseys to the Gay, Lesbian & Straight Education Network (GLSEN) and the Matthew Shepard Foundation. In addition, the league will auction off Collins' autographed, game-worn jerseys to benefit the same organizations. ""It's really cool to see the support that's out there,"" Collins told CNN's Rachel Nichols in an interview set to air Friday evening. ""And yeah, it's cool to see that people are going out there and buying the jersey and, you know, wearing it with pride. So I hope that continues, and you know I'll keep wearing the jersey and keep going out there and trying to, you know, do my job."" Collins became a symbol for the gay rights movement after disclosing that he is gay in an April Sports Illustrated magazine column. Since then, he's received a warm outpouring of support from basketball colleagues, league officials and fans. ""I know everyone in the NBA family is excited for him and proud that our league fosters an inclusive and respectful environment,"" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said after Collins' signing last Sunday. Collins' path from a little-known, aging NBA center to gay rights icon who was invited by first lady Michelle Obama to the State of the Union is one that speaks to the nation's changing attitudes about homosexuality. Last week, he signed a 10-day contract with the Brooklyn Nets. According to a national Quinnipiac University poll conducted in September, 56% of the nation supports marriage for same-sex couples, compared with only 25% who supported it in 1996.

"(CNN) -- Eight women and four men convened regularly over 13 months. They heard from dozens of witnesses, considered 30,000 pieces of evidence. All of it with one question in mind: Who killed 6-year-old JonBenet Ramsey? On October 13, 1999 -- nearly three years after the diminutive Colorado pageant queen's body was found in her home -- the 12 grand jurors went back to their own homes, sworn to silence and with nothing apparently to show for their effort. ""We do not have sufficient evidence to warrant the filing of charges,"" then-Boulder County District Attorney Alex Hunter said. The presumption was that the grand jury hadn't voted to indict anyone. That included failing to take action against JonBenet's parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, whom Boulder police had said were under ""an umbrella of suspicion"" in the girl's death. Yet the Boulder Daily Camera, the newspaper in that Colorado city, now says there was more to the story. Citing several unidentified jurors as well as an assistant district attorney in Hunter's office, the paper reports that the grand jury did, in fact, vote to indict the Ramsey parents on charges of child abuse resulting in death. ""We didn't know who did what,"" one juror told the Camera, ""but we felt the adults in the house may have done something that they certainly could have prevented, or they could have helped her, and they didn't."" ""Or saying that they as a grand jury did not know what happened,"" retorted Lin Wood, an Atlanta attorney who has represented the Ramseys over the years. His comments came on CNN Tuesday after being asked to respond to what the anonymous juror told the paper. Wood said the grand jury was ""likely confused."" Hunter, the man who presented the case to them, didn't sign the indictment, however, the Daily Camera reports. Paper: Panel voted in '99 to indict parents of JonBenet Ramsey, DA didn't sign on . It's a decision that Bill Wise, a former prosecutor who wasn't directly involved in the grand jury proceedings, confirmed to the paper and said makes sense. ""The state of the evidence in that case was simply inadequate to file a charge, in my opinion, and that obviously was Hunter's opinion, too,"" Wise said. ""Whether it's against one or two people, you just didn't have the evidence."" Wood called Alex Hunter a ""hero."" ""Jon and Patsy Ramsey had been told back in '99 by their attorneys they should expect to be indicted,"" he said. ""You have to go back 15, 16 years to remember there was a media frenzy of false accusations against this family. There was an incompetent and prejudiced Boulder Police Department investigation, the investigation that focused on day one on the Ramsey family and refused to follow the evidence that would have led to the killer of this child. ""They (the Ramseys) expected that they would be indicted and they expected they would have their names cleared in front of a judge or a jury,"" Wood said. The attorney pointed to the 2008 findings from then-District Attorney Mary Lacy that DNA tests ruled out any Ramsey family member's involvement in the girl's death. ""The DNA tests performed after the time of the Boulder grand jury not only prove the Ramsey family to be innocent and the grand jury wrong, they also make former District Attorney Alex Hunter a hero who wisely avoided a gross miscarriage of justice,"" Wood told CNN in an interview Monday. Those now in the Boulder County District Attorney's Office aren't commenting on the report in the Daily Camera, spokeswoman Catherine Olguin said Monday. Mom: 'There's a killer on the loose' It was December 26, 1996 -- a day after JonBenet got a bicycle as a Christmas gift -- when Patsy Ramsey said she discovered a three-page ransom note in her Boulder home. Police came and, later that day, found JonBenet's beaten and strangled body in the family's basement. Days after burying the girl in suburban Atlanta, where they had previously lived, the Ramseys appeared on CNN. ""There's a killer on the loose,"" Patsy Ramsey said January 1, 1997, in an interview that brought an intense national spotlight on the case. ""I don't know who it is. I don't know if it's a she or a he, but if I were a resident of Boulder, I would tell my friends to keep your babies close to you. There's someone out there."" The parents insisted an intruder committed the crime, but no one was caught and no description was given. In time, the focus turned on the parents: Could they have done it? Investigators didn't find any sign of forced entry. A paintbrush from her mother's hobby kit was used to tighten the rope that choked JonBenet. And the alleged ransom note was written from paper inside the house and referenced little-known details about the family's past and its finances. Despite the suspicions, the Ramseys were never named as suspects. But they were a focus of the grand jury, which first convened in September 1998. On Monday, CNN talked with one juror and another's spouse, both of whom indicated that -- at the behest of the district attorney's office -- they would not discuss the case. Messages left by CNN with several other jurors were not immediately answered. But according to Wise and several jurors who talked with the Daily Camera, the decision was eventually made to indict John and Patsy Ramsey. This was even though the jurors weren't sure who, exactly, had killed young JonBenet. 16 years later, still no arrests or charges . According to Wise, who worked as a prosecutor for 28 years before retiring, there was disagreement among the eight or so involved in the prosecution about what to do after the grand jury voted to indict. He told the Daily Camera that he thinks his former boss did the right thing not pressing forward with the case, arguing that the evidence didn't show whether Patsy or John Ramsey may have been more directly responsible. ""If I were on a jury, I would not convict either of them,"" said Wise. As is, while there have been many twists and turns since the grand jury was discharged in 1999, there's been no closure. The Ramseys were busy in March 2000, releasing their book ""The Death of Innocence,"" filing multimillion-dollar lawsuits against media organizations who they say libeled their son (who was 9 at the time of JonBenet's death) and settling a lawsuit with a tabloid newspaper. That May, the Ramseys returned to CNN to face off with Steve Thomas, a former Boulder police detective who'd released a book of his own. Thomas claimed the girl died after ""an explosive encounter"" over a bed-wetting incident, something the Ramseys fiercely denied. The district attorney's office, then led by Lacy, took over the case from Boulder police in 2002. Four years later, there was an apparent breakthrough with the arrest of 41-year-old teacher John Mark Karr in Bangkok, Thailand. This came after he freely -- and repeatedly -- said he was with JonBenet the night she died, although he insisted her death was an accident and that he ""loved"" her. But soon after his arrest and return to Colorado, prosecutors announced DNA evidence proved Karr had nothing to do with JonBenet's death. That same year, 2006, Patsy Ramsey died at the age of 49 following a fight with ovarian cancer. Then came Lacy's 2008 letter to John Ramsey, exonerating him and the rest of his family after tests of DNA evidence found in the girl's underwear and beneath her fingernails. ""To the extent that we may have contributed in any way to the public perception that you might have been involved in this crime, I am deeply sorry,"" Lacy wrote. Since then, authorities have said they'd continued to try to find answers. But despite their work, the case remains as cold as it was on that late December day, 16 years ago.","Atlanta lawyer Lin Wood: Comments given to Boulder paper show grand jury didn't know truth .

"Washington (CNN) -- With the rollout of HealthCare.gov -- the portal for enrollment in the new Obamacare health care exchanges -- getting hammered by critics and users, CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta sat down with Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius for an exclusive interview. Here are Gupta's takeaways from the interview: . 1. Full speed ahead . I was surprised to learn just how extensive the concerns were before the October 1 rollout. Congressional investigators claim that just weeks before the planned rollout, more than two-thirds of insurers had concerns about the system being viable by October 1. Just days before the launch, the website crashed while being tested with just a few hundred people logging in, according to the Washington Post. Despite all that, the White House decided to move forward. When I pressed Sebelius on this point, she said, ""We moved forward because millions of people have been waiting for health care insurance,"" and they didn't want to delay any longer. Sebelius on the spot over Obamacare rollout . She made that point a few times: A few weeks won't make that much of a difference given that open enrollment lasts until the end of March, and that millions more people could have health insurance by that time. 2. Obama didn't know? According to Sebelius, President Barack Obama was not aware of any significant problems until a ""couple days"" after the website had been launched. The Affordable Care Act is touted as a signature achievement for the Obama administration, and it surprised me that the President was not being kept up to speed -- according to Sebelius -- on the concerns around the rollout. Sebelius: Obamacare website rollout problems blindsided President . 3. A-Team late to arrive . Sebelius said in order to get the website running smoothly, she has asked that contractors bring in their ""best and brightest,"" their ""A-Team."" I was surprised that the A-Team hadn't been assembled earlier, given the magnitude of the ACA, and the challenge of setting up the website. When I pressed the Secretary on this point, she just said that she wants new eyes and ears, and to put all hands on deck, working toward a solution as quickly as possible. 4. Open to delaying fines? Sebelius did not back down on the individual mandate, which requires people to have health insurance or pay a fine. I asked how it was possible that people could face a fine, if they had tried to sign up and were unsuccessful. At that point, it seems she might have left the window open to a delay, saying only: ""I don't think that that really is the question right now."" ""The issue is will people be able to sign up for affordable health care in the six-month open enrollment period? And I think the answer is absolutely yes."" Whether or not this issue comes up again is unclear. For now, the Secretary said the individual mandate is here to stay. Administration to kick off effort to encourage enrollment . 5. Falling on her sword? Finally, I asked her about the calls for her resignation. Over the past few days, her friend, Sen. Pat Roberts, as well as 2012 Republican vice presidential candidate Rep. Paul Ryan, have raised the possibility. While not giving a decisive no, Sebelius again reinforced the mission of this task, saying it was the most important job she has ever had. She also reinforced that she served at the pleasure of the President.","Sebelius said they pressed on with rollout because they didn't want to delay access to health care .

"Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN) -- Somalia's Parliament ousted the country's Prime Minister in a vote of no confidence Monday after a dispute between him and the President over Cabinet picks. The move against Prime Minister Abdi Farah Shirdon is the latest government shake-up for a country that has struggled to achieve an effective central government since a dictator's overthrow two decades ago. Shirdon, in office less than 14 months, lost the confidence vote 184-65, Parliament Speaker Mohamed Osman Jawari said. He said the current government will remain until a new prime minister takes office. Somalia's constitution gives President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud a month to appoint a new prime minister, who would need to be confirmed by Parliament. Al-Shabaab attack on Somali police station kills at least 12 . Mohamud appointed Shirdon to the post in October 2012, just a month after lawmakers elected Mohamud to his office. But relations between the two leaders soured when Shirdon, who was supposed to serve a four-year term, refused to put Mohamud's picks into the Cabinet, which was going to be reshuffled and expanded. ""Some members of the Cabinet who are looking for their own interest, and not the interest of the nation, are the ones behind"" the no-confidence vote, Shirdon told reporters in his office on Monday. He said before the vote that he would comply with whatever decision the Parliament made. Mohamud said Monday that he recognized ""the effort and the dedication of the outgoing Prime Minister and his Cabinet."" ""I also congratulate the speaker and his deputies (for) their leadership of the Parliament's deliberation in this critical time of the Parliament's history,"" Mohamud said in a news release. Shirdon is the fifth Somali prime minister removed from his post without finishing his term since dictator Mohamed Siad Barre was overthrown 22 years ago. When he accepted the position in 2012, Shirdon, an economist who used to run an import business in neighboring Kenya, told the Parliament that his government would do more to ensure the security of the country and to fight against terrorism and piracy. Somalia plunged into chaos after Barre was overthrown in 1991. After his ouster, clan warlords and militants battled for control, sparking a civil war and nationwide mayhem. Central governance has been shaky since then. One of the largest challenges is Islamist militant group Al-Shabaab, which is fighting the government in hopes of turning Somalia into a fundamentalist Islamic state. CNN's Jason Hanna contributed to this report.","Prime Minister, President had clashed over Cabinet picks .

Instead, the group has made it its mission to re-enact famous scenes from movies -- romantic comedies, action, fantasy films, you name it -- in ordinary situations. The group's most recent stunt took place at Katz's Delicatessen, the setting for the classic fake orgasm scene in 1989's ""When Harry Met Sally."" Meg Ryan's Sally was proving a point to Billy Crystal's Harry that women can indeed simulate pleasure without actually being satisfied, and her performance was so convincing, another customer wanted to ""have what she's having."" But what would happen if that scenario was repeated in real life? Better yet, what would happen if not one, but 20 women pretended to orgasm simultaneously in the middle of Katz's lunch rush? Improv Everywhere set to find out. The organization says on its website that the employees at Katz weren't aware that a loud, uninhibited flash mob had descended on the restaurant, but everyone seemed to be amused by the show. ""When Harry Met Sally"" isn't the only film Improv Everywhere has experimented with.

"(CNN) -- Retail marijuana licenses issued by Colorado -- the first in the nation -- should arrive in the mail by the end of this week, according to the state Department of Revenue's Marijuana Enforcement Division. The state sent out 348 retail marijuana licenses to prospective retail marijuana establishments on Monday, including 136 marijuana stores, 178 marijuana cultivation facilities, 31 products manufacturing facilities and three marijuana testing facilities. The state's retail marijuana licensing process includes fingerprint-based background checks and financial checks. The businesses must also receive approval from the local authorities before they may operate. Thomas Behler, assistant manager at Ganja Gourmet, a medical marijuana dispensary in Denver, said he is happy about the licenses. ""Business should increase exponentially; every 21-year-old on the planet is going to come here,"" he said. ""We already have a successful business, but we are not in it for the money. We are helping people and providing them with a service."" Mason Tvert, director of communications for the Marijuana Policy Project, also praised the development, which he said will affect efforts in other states. ""Colorado will be leaving prohibition behind in the new year,"" he said. ""The movement taking place in Colorado has piqued the interest of voters and elected officials around the country, many of whom will be taking the issue on in 2014."" But Kevin Sabet, director of Smart Approaches to Marijuana, called the sale of recreational marijuana a ""social experiment."" ""This is the beginning of an era we will come to regret later -- where corporate greed in the name of ""Big Marijuana"" openly promotes a product that every credible scientist has concluded is connected to mental illness, IQ loss, car crashes, and lung problems,"" said Sabet, who co-founded the group with Patrick Kennedy. ""Hang on, we're in for a wild ride, and sadly Colorado will be using its kids as guinea pigs for this social experiment."" In November, Colorado voters resoundingly supported taxing recreational marijuana. A year earlier, voters approved legalizing it. Opponents argued that it was unfair to single out marijuana for higher taxation over products such as beer. But strong support came from the fact that the nonpartisan Colorado Legislative Council projected it would generate nearly $70 million in additional state tax revenue next year.","Colorado's retail marijuana licenses, the first in the nation, to arrive by mail this week .

"(CNN) -- An earthquake in central Oklahoma prompted a few calls to the police but no apparent damage Saturday. The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake had a preliminary 4.5 magnitude to the quake and said it was centered near Jones, Oklahoma, 14 miles northeast of Oklahoma City. The shaking lasted 3 to 5 seconds at 12:15 p.m. Central Time, said Oklahoma City police Lt. Jason Samuel. He said a few people called the department to ask what happened. No damage had been reported. Samuel said the quake was strong enough to wake him from a nap at his home. He said it seemed stronger and longer-lasting that other earthquakes in the area in recent years.

"(CNN) -- When pictures leaked out in December of the late Steve Jobs' new yacht, Venus, leaving The Netherlands, interest was once again sparked in the mysterious world of the super mega yachts, and in those who build them for the super mega rich. I say mysterious because the business of yacht building is full of rumors and speculation until the ship is seen leaving the sheds of the family-owned builders, whether in Amsterdam, Hamburg or Bremen. Read more: Steve Jobs' yacht impounded over pay dispute . A bit of the veil on this industry was lifted in London in January when the builders and designers of the biggest yachts celebrated the launch of the 2013 Top 100 Forecast from superyachts.com. The backers of this event are at pains to remind people this business employs thousands of people (craftsmen, architects, builders, designers, deckhands), and when a new anchorage is discovered by the rich and famous to park their yachts, it can generate a lot of income for a region. Read more: Sailing the world's most beautiful lakes . And since they aren't allowed to talk about those who buy these yachts, they are only to happy to talk all about the business. Herbert Aly, the CEO of Blohm+Voss, told me that superyacht building was actually hurt during the economic crisis. It took some time for the slowdown to filter through as orders can take five to seven years to fulfill, so 2011 and 2012 were the tough years. But that's coming to an end. Watch here: Yacht sales down amid austerity . ""We've seen the rock bottom of it,"" Aly stressed. ""And I think 2013 will be a promising year for the industry, for the big ones."" Aly said the bigger yacht side of the business is coming back faster than the smaller side. Read more: Adventurers recreate 'greatest survival story' of the Antarctic . Aly's competitor Peter Lurssen would agree. His famed Lurssen shipyard in Bremen will soon unleash the world's longest mega yacht, codenamed Project Azzam. While Lurssen is not allowed to confirm the owner, or the specifics, he can talk a little bit more once aficionados caught a glimpse of it. ""The yacht had to leave one shed and flowed through the river to the next shed, and even though the nose wasn't on, specialists were there with their instruments and they figured out it, yes it will be longer than what is flowing today."" Watch here: 'Super yachts' gather in London . The '""specialists"" estimate it will be around 180 meters long, beating out Roman Abramovich's Eclipse, built by Blohm+Voss, which comes in at 163.5 meters long. Will they just keep getting longer? ""Maybe we will see 200 meters, but I think that's it,"" said Aly. ""Why do you go for a bigger one if you are alone on it?"" Read more: Olympic yachts glide into London for a colorful makeover . Well, not exactly alone, since some of the mega yachts need 60 to 80 employees when the boat is in full use. But he has a point. We could ask one of the owners, but they tend to like the yacht to do the talking. Henk de Vries of Feadship built the Venus for Jobs, though he won't confirm that. But he says building for the mega rich also means building an intimate relationship. ""It's very personal. I have the cell phone number of my customers."" And they have his. ""Oh, yes, and they call me when something breaks down."" Does that mean de Vries will do whatever it takes to strike a deal with a tech billionaire or Saudi sheik? ""I had someone ask me the other day, 'but you can't say no to a prince?' I said, yes, we do. We do it all the time,"" de Vries said, laughing. All the builders stress that the ship takes on the personality of the person paying for it, and that things like the interior can change over the years it takes to build the ship. But since they only can book a profit once the yacht is delivered, they work hard to find a compromise. And de Vries has something new and special coming out of the shed soon. ""Whereas the Venus was about eliminating everything, and going back to even than more than basic, just purity and form in design. This project that will be shown to the world, again I can't say anything, except that it is very large, and it's immensely complex and has everything that is included in that one."" In other words, while the roofline of Venus looks like -- you guessed it -- an iPhone, the next one will be all about the bling. Project Azzam will be all about the yacht's length. With the business of big yachts coming back, it's possible other builders might want to get in on the action. Europe's family-run yacht builders caution against it. ""We see military shipyards, commercial shipyards who think, 'oh, OK. I'll do a frigate, paint it white, put a nice interior in it, I have a nice yacht.' No way,"" said de Vries. It's about the personal touch, as Lurssen stressed. ""We had a client that had in the contract that I could never resign as a director as long as the yacht is still not delivered, in fact not out of warranty."" At a time that Europe is very worried about jobs, the uptick in interest for mega yachts should be looked at in a positive light, even if news reports will soon be filled with gossip (and jealousy?) over Project Azzam and the ""bells and whistles"" yachts to soon sail away from the shores of Europe to the Middle East.","Aly, CEO of Blohm+Voss, told CNN that super yacht building was hurt in the crisis .

"New York (CNN) -- A Newtown, Connecticut, police officer haunted by the horrific images of the mass shooting at an elementary school there said Monday that he could lose his job after being diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Thomas Bean was one of the first officers to respond to the December 2012 shooting that left 26 dead, including 20 children. He told CNN that he has contemplated cutting himself with a razor, continues to have flashbacks, and is left crying some nights by memories of the bloodshed. ""Nothing could prepare you for that,"" Bean, a 12-year veteran, told CNN's Susan Candiotti. ""The worst possible scenes you could think of ... because all there was, was horror."" Bean was diagnosed with PTSD and has not been able to return to work.

The union that represents Newtown police officers may file a lawsuit.

""The last thing you want is a first responder getting ready to enter a situation and have them think, 'I wonder what long-term harm this will do me?'"" In an e-mail, Newtown Police Chief Michael Kehoe declined to discuss the matter. Local officials did not return calls or e-mails seeking comment. Bean told CNN that he broke down in tears after Sandy Hook Elementary School was cleared. He drank and smoked excessively. He even contemplated cutting himself with a razor. ""I didn't want to kill myself but I wanted to feel something,"" he said. ""Had no feeling, no sensation, no nothing."" Adam Lanza, 20, shot and killed 20 young children and six teachers in the school before taking his own life -- a massacre that prompted a national debate over tougher gun laws. Bean said he knew he was in ""deep, deep trouble"" after entering a store one day. ""I looked at everyone in that store like they was going to kill me,"" he said. ""I could not get out of that store fast enough. I looked around, and there was a crowd of people, and all I saw were flashbacks -- (the) firehouse with the families or what I saw that day."" Bean, 38, who's married with two children, remains in therapy. He said he is grateful for support from one group in particular, called Save a Warrior. Bean urges others suffering from PTSD to seek help. ""The Save A Warrior program that I went through is free,"" he said. ""We even had some law enforcement from LAPD and NYPD go through the program."" Other Newtown police officers were diagnosed with PSTD, but Bean was the only one unable to return to work, union officials said. ""If I had my arm chopped off, they'd would say, 'Oh yeah, he's hurt.'

"(CNN) -- Southern Britain is getting hammered by a major Atlantic storm, which could be its worst in years, and the search for a missing teenager swept out to sea ended for the night with no sign of the boy. The unidentified teenager disappeared from Newhaven, East Sussex, on the southern coast, according to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. Strong winds blew and heavy rains fell late Sunday. Conditions were expected to worsen as the night progresses. ""This weather system is typical of what we expect to see in winter, but as it's coming in during autumn -- when trees are in leaf -- and while the ground is fairly saturated, it does pose some risks. We could see some uprooted trees or other damage from the winds, and there's a chance of some surface water flooding from the rainfall -- all of which could lead to some disruption,"" said Martin Young, chief forecaster at the Met Office, the UK's national weather service. Gusts of 60 to 70 mph are forecast in southern parts of England and Wales, with bursts of 80 mph or more in some places. ""While this is a major storm for the UK, we don't currently expect winds to be as strong as those seen in the 'Great Storm' of 1987 or the 'Burns Day storm' of 1990,"" Young said.

"Sao Paulo, Brazil (CNN) -- A pregnant 14-year-old raped, a grenade tossed into a crowd by robbers during a getaway. Those are just a few of the stories tucked inside Rio de Janeiro's main newspaper, O Globo, this week. Crime and violence are chronic problems in Brazil, where the murder rate is even higher than in Mexico. Which helps explain why news of the grisly killing and beheading of a former professional football player didn't even make front-page news in many papers. Police believe that 35-year-old Joao Rodrigo Silva Santos was abducted on Monday evening. When his wife opened the door to leave for work the following morning, she found a backpack with her husband's head inside. According to Brazilian media, Santos' eyes and tongue had been cut out. Santos played for a number of mostly second-tier Rio de Janeiro football clubs before retiring and opening a health food store. Police refused to comment on lines of investigation, but media have speculated that it could be related to a break-in at Santos' store this year. Some newspapers also pointed out that his wife works for the police department in one of the shantytowns that recently came under police control, although she reportedly is a social worker there. The news did, however, make headlines around the world, shining the spotlight yet again on violence in one of the host cities of the 2014 World Cup. And while World Cup tickets are selling at record rates, experts say the violent protest marches that erupted during the Confederations Cup, combined with headlines about crime and violence, might make fans think twice about bringing their families to Brazil. In April: Tourist raped on minibus in Rio . Brazilians themselves were horrified by the story, but to a certain degree, they have become accustomed to crime and violence. In Rio de Janeiro, cars drive through red lights at night. The drivers don't stop for fear of being robbed. Brazilians rarely carry cash, using debit cards even to pay for a cup of espresso. In Sao Paulo, criminal ""sweeps"" of restaurants and bars are common. An armed gang moves through in a matter of minutes, relieving patrons of all their valuables. Despite that, murders in the states of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro actually dropped 76% and 44% between 2001 and 2011, according to the Rio-based Brazilian Center for Latin American Studies. The murder rate in Brazil as a whole has risen 132% over the past 30 years but has dropped since reaching a peak in 2003. 10 cops in Brazil accused of killing and hiding body .","The horrible killing of a footballer wasn't even on the front page of newspapers .

"(CNN) -- It was spring. I was in love. No, not with a man. But with a New York City apartment. An apartment I had yet to find. But I knew exactly what I was looking for, and exactly how it would make me feel. Like a city girl, tough and tender, coming home. My place would be clean, bathed in sunlight, in an elegant prewar building, with a spare room for my college-age daughter. It would certainly not be fixer-upper (a ""wreck,"" as we say around here), and would have updated plumbing and wiring. I'd walk out of there every day feeling like a character in a Woody Allen movie. I simply couldn't live anywhere else. Not so long ago, I wrote about a similar quest -- for a good man. That didn't quite pan out. Now, after selling my suburban Long Island house of 22 years, I set my sights on finding an affordable apartment in Manhattan in a vibrant, safe neighborhood. I know what you're thinking: Good luck with that. New York 2013 is the Wild West of real estate. A seller's market? That's an understatement. According to The New York Times, a go-to place for apartment listings, in October 2009 there were 8,150 apartments listed for sale in Manhattan. Three years later, there were 6,241. By October 2013, that number had dwindled to 4,344. Based on their listings, the average price for an apartment in Manhattan, according to the Times, is $1.1 million. New York, we have a problem. The ""man-apartment"" similarities abound. Sometimes, if you're online dating and reach out to a good prospect, he doesn't respond. Busy, or not interested -- who knows? But unavailable, for sure. Trolling the real estate websites, you click on a link and find the apartment of your dreams. But it's already taken: ""Contract Signed."" Strolling the avenue, you see a nice-looking guy. Dare to lock eyes with him? Stop right there. Didn't you see that little gold ring? A good man in New York is like prime real estate, snapped up before you can blink. Photos are a source of hope and despair for both apartment- and man-hunters. Any veteran online dater knows how important attractive profile photos are -- and how deceptive they can be. Feeling butterflies before a first date? Perhaps because you're not entirely sure the person you've been chatting with online even resembles his profile photo. Only by meeting will you know if this relationship is doomed, because more often than not, you'll be burned by the big reveal. It's the same with properties. Using wide-angle lenses, photographers can make a closet seem like a ballroom. To help find my apartment ""match,"" I signed with an experienced buyer's broker: Roberta Moser of Halstead Property. I might be in love with New York, but I needed a reality check. ""Be prepared to be disappointed,"" Roberta said. ""It's OK to fall in love with an apartment, but you can't get too attached to an apartment."" Forget negotiating. Unless you're making an offer on a dump, expect a bidding war. Dozens of people show up for open houses, even waiting on line in the bitter cold to see apartments. A broker may hand you the sales sheet, which lists the apartment features and price, while declaring: ""That's not really the price. It's going up today."" It's a head-spinning exercise. You think you're close to clinching a deal, and suddenly another buyer swoops in to offer cash for an apartment. Your bid may be accepted, but until the seller signs the contract, you're in limbo. Could another buyer steal your apartment, and your heart, away? Moser and I found a lovely place on the Upper West Side. The moment I walked in, I just knew. ""I want that apartment,"" I told her in the elevator. We entered a bid within hours. For days, the selling broker flirted with me, toyed with me. ""There are other offers, but she's a great candidate,"" he told Moser. We entered our ""best and final"" bid, but were tied with another buyer. In the end, someone offered $12,000 more. I guess best and final wasn't really ""final."" Deceived again. How far will New York buyers go to get an apartment they want? Once, when there were multiple offers, Moser recalled, ""a buyer delivered a signed contract with a check for $100,000 over the asking price of the apartment."" There had been no negotiation. ""The seller, of course, went with them,"" she said. After losing two bids, I finally found the apartment I would buy. Moser, the ultimate real estate matchmaker, found me the right space at a decent price. It wasn't love at first sight. (The '80s decor was nearly enough to kill all desire.) And it was not the prewar building I had pined for. But it was a good deal -- and with a little luck, everything fell into place. My bid was accepted. Contract signed. How could meeting a man in New York possibly be as difficult as landing an affordable apartment? New York matchmaker Maria Avgitidis, of Agape Match, says it's infinitely harder. Just as in real estate, there's a dearth of inventory. ""In general, you have four single straight women to every single straight man,"" Avgitidis explains. ""It's the worst city. Men here have so much choice that it gets distracting,"" she adds. ""Manhattan, specifically, attracts the most ambitious people on the planet."" And all those type-A personalities don't work well for matchmaking. ""You're talking about the top 5%, or top 1% of women. They don't take no for an answer and they have incredibly high standards,"" says Avgitidis. As for men, ""you have single dads, divorced dads, widowers, a good portion looking for women 10 years younger than they are. It's a huge mismatch."" So, now that I've gone to all the trouble of moving here -- how can I ever meet a nice guy? Maybe I should try another city. In Seattle, for example, ""there are four single men to every single woman,"" says Avgitidis. ""The men look incredibly good. They all work out, they all dress nice, they all have nice apartments."" That is, if I can ever bear the thought of moving again.","CNN producer Ronni Berke has written about her online dating misadventures .

"(CNN) -- Rebecca and Roni Kopelman have been celebrating Christmas and Hanukkah since they got together in 2006, building the foundations of an interfaith household. Some of the Ohio couple's holiday traditions are blended, like their Christmas tree decked out in menorah ornaments and blue and white lights; others adhere more closely to the standard formula. During Hanukkah, her husband prepares a latke feast, they light the menorah each night and exchange small gifts. For Christmas, they hang stockings, bake cookies, go to church on Christmas Eve and open presents the next morning. ""To some people, this might seem challenging and strange, but to us, it's a wonderful way of celebrating and respecting each other's history and tradition without taking anything away from our own,"" Kopelman said in a CNN iReport. ""I love sharing my husband's memories and passed-down family traditions at Hanukkah, and he happily decorates -- and eats! -- Christmas cookies and shares memories with me as we hang ornaments on the tree."" Some families keep strict religious and family traditions around holidays, but more families are blending religious and cultural traditions. Outside of the holidays, the Kopelmans don't consider themselves extremely religious ""in the textbook way,"" she said. She was raised Methodist and he was raised Jewish and both went through the traditional rites of their religion. But when they went away to college, they became less fastidious in their religion pursuits, and remain so today. ""Our family history and backgrounds are important to us both, so our religions have become more like a culture or tradition we like to honor,"" she said. ""We were both raised to be good people who value love and acceptance, and this is the shared part of our religions that we tend to focus on at home."" Families across the country have long celebrated more than one holiday in December, but only recently did those traditions gain the name ""Chrismukkah."" Jill Erickson and her partner have embraced the label ever since it was first coined on the television show, ""The OC,"" in the mid-2000s. To Erickson, who is Episcopalian, and her Jewish partner, Chrismukkah represents their efforts to incorporate their respective traditions into the holiday season. ""We try to have a good sense of humor about the whole blending thing,"" said Erickson, 56. Erickson shared images on CNN iReport that show mixed holiday decorations in their Falmouth, Massachusetts, home, from a menorah and advent calendar to stockings bearing the phrase ""shalom"" and plates decorated with dreidels on a red plaid table cloth. ""I grew up loving Christmas. My partner does his best to go along with all my enthusiasms. He has grown to love Swedish meatballs, which I make for Christmas. The one thing he won't do is help decorate the tree, but he has become very adept at putting Christmas lights outside!"" But mixed families don't necessarily need to embrace the label to create the foundations of their interfaith households. Cassie Pham, of Los Angeles, California, and her boyfriend of two years moved in together recently, making this the first year they merge holiday traditions. She's a Vietnamese-American who celebrates Christmas and he's Jewish. Like the Kopelmans, they have a Christmas tree with dreidel ornaments and a menorah, which they light each night. Pham learned to cook matzo ball soup. ""For me, Chrismukkah represents our relationship at its best,"" Pham said in a CNN iReport. ""We blend our two cultures and lives together not just during this time, but through the year and different events in our families. I like that we are both open mind and are respectful of each others' cultures."" This year is especially meaningful for the Kopelmans as they celebrate their first holiday season with their son, who was born December 28, 2011. ""With this as his first 'Chrismukkah season' -- not a blended holiday, but rather just the season when both are celebrated at our house -- we couldn't be more excited to introduce him to the fun, the food, and the spirit of each holiday.""","Interfaith households blend religious and cultural traditions of Christmas and Hanukkah .

"(CNN) -- Minimalist blogging platform Posterous drew its last breath earlier this week. The service, a favorite among mobile bloggers who liked to post on the go, officially shut down four years after it was originally created, one year after it was purchased by Twitter, and two months after it informed users that it was closing. That came on the heels of other closures, and announcements thereof. Google Reader, the popular RSS tool, will shut down July 1 and EveryBlock, the hyper-local news site, was shuttered in February. It's a reality of the Internet that sites are constantly starting up, shutting down or getting acquired. But that doesn't make the loss of a beloved site any less upsetting or inconvenient for its faithful fans. To preserve your sanity, and your data, here are a few tips for handling the death of a favorite website or service. Pay attention to warnings . Most sites won't shutter without giving their users official notice. To avoid being caught off-guard, read any updates, e-mails, blog posts or tweets from the company warning of major changes or sharing goodbyes. There are also less obvious signs. When a company starts neglecting a site's design or features, that could mean it's shifting resources to other projects or running low on money. Google Reader's last significant update happened in late 2011. Nearly a year and a half later, Google finally announced the beloved RSS reader was being ""retired."" So ask yourself, does a site seem like it's stayed exactly the same for the past year, unloved and a little retro around the edges? Does it still have a button to share content on Google Buzz but nothing for Pinterest? It might be time to pack it in. The decision to close a site might come suddenly after an acquisition by another company. If the purchase is labeled an ""aqui-hire"" that means the purchasing company is interested in the people on staff, not in the product they've built. Of course, a slow, steady drop in popularity can be a solid sign of a site nearing the end. If you are the last of your friends using a social network, it might be time to move on before Justin Timberlake shows up. Save your data . A site shutting down can be especially upsetting if you've invested time in it, become part of a community, or created or uploaded content. Blog posts, photo libraries, bookmark collections, conversations, messages, friend networks and carefully curated folders of RSS feeds will typically disappear with the site. Most services do the courteous thing and offer a way to save data. Posterous added a way for bloggers to export their sites as XML files before it closed. Google has a site dedicated to exporting data from all its various services called Google Takeout. When a major site announces it is closing, competing sites often step up and offer ways to transfer content directly to a new blog, RSS feeder, album or other service. But not all companies follow these rules. When NBC shut down EveryBlock, the announcement was sudden and the closure immediate. There was no way for community members to preserve or download the lively discussion threads that were the heart of the site, and they weren't publicly archived. If you have valuable content stored on a site, make periodic backups, even if you think that company will be around forever. Stay in touch . If a site includes a strong community, find other ways to connect with the friends and contacts you've made once it is offline. Even when you can export your own data, connections with other people will disappear with the site. Be sure to connect on e-mail, IM, Twitter or Facebook. You can also reunite on the site you move to next, which is what some EveryBlock members did when they migrated to NextDoor, a newer hyper-local community site. Delete your profile . Once you've extracted all the content you need from a dying site, consider hitting the self destruct button on your profile. Any information left on the service can linger on the Internet for years, and personal information might even be sold off to other companies. When people abandoned MySpace for Facebook's greener pastures, many left behind old profiles adorned with what seemed like hysterical photos at the time. Now those people are older, perhaps trying to get jobs or dates, and old MySpace pages still haunt their search results. Unless you remember your password, getting rid of old profile pages can be difficult. Find an alternative . Once you've been dumped by a favorite website it can be hard to learn how to trust again. Early adopters are used to constantly signing up for new services that close months or a year later. But most people might be hesitant to jump right in and invest time and energy in a new site. When you are ready, there are some things to consider when choosing a replacement. New startups are still finding their legs and could be bought or go under, but if you don't mind the uncertainty, they often have some of the most exciting new designs. Look for sites that offer ways to import your old data, and if you crave stability, for companies that are profitable and still growing. There are many good alternatives to Posterous vying for the attention of the newly homeless bloggers. WordPress is established and dependable, Tumblr is easy and attractive, and newer companies like Medium are exciting, but their futures are uncertain. If you can wait a bit, two Posterous co-founders are working on a new project called Posthaven. They pledge never to sell the company and to keep all URLs online no matter what. ""This one is made to last forever,"" reads the site's tagline. Forever is a pretty bold promise online. Make a backup, just in case. The gallery above shows some sites that have disappeared over the years. What websites would you add to the list?","Popular or not, no site's future is guaranteed on the Web .
Blogging platform Posterous was shut down for good this week by new owner Twitter .
Make sure to transfer data, get contact information for online friends .

"Leicester, England (CNN) -- Elliot Higgins has never been to Syria. He has no friends and family there. Nor does he have any military experience or background in weapons analysis. But when he lost his job last year, he used the extra hours to indulge an interest in current events, particularly the Arab Spring. Sitting in his living room in Leicester, England, he started a blog under the handle Brown Moses, after a Frank Zappa song. ""I literally thought: No one is going to read this. But I'm doing it for my own entertainment."" In fact, by sifting through hundreds of battle videos posted online, Higgins has shown the Syrian army's use of cluster bombs -- now documented by Human Rights Watch -- although Syria has denied using cluster bombs. He's also showed a trail of Croatian weapons supplied to Syria's rebels by Saudi Arabia with the consent of Western allies -- an investigative expose published in the New York Times. ""It's really about finding the patterns of what's going on,"" Higgins says. ""With the cluster bombs the Syrian government still seems to have the official policy of refusing to state that they are using them. And I've collected a vast amount of evidence of cluster bombs in Syria. There is video of cluster bombs dispersing from helicopters. That's something that can't really be faked."" He tracks the weapons of the war in Syria on his laptop from a cream-colored sofa in his living room. ""When the Syrian air force started using helicopters, I was looking at that,"" he recalls. ""Then I saw my first partly exploded bomb and identified that. That was really the start of weapons identification."" Higgins describes a daily routine that's part Mr. Mom, part intelligence analyst. ""I have to take care of my 18-month-old daughter during the day. So, I'm sort of checking my e-mails off and on, just keeping an eye on Twitter. And when my daughter's in bed, I'll sort of sit down and look at videos. I've got a list of about 450 activist channels on YouTube."" Elliott shows CNN one video of a Syrian rebel fighter with a grenade launcher tucked into his shoulder. He freeze-frames and points to two tiny bolts that he says prove this is a Croatian weapon, not a South African version. ""It shows a Croatian RPG-6 grenade launcher. And one of the things I was looking for was the specific type. Because they're an exact copy of another grenade launcher that's virtually identical."" It's this unerring eye for detail that has made him a bona fide member of an online community of experts that's monitoring the war and has put him in high demand with Syria watchers. He now contributes to Foreign Policy magazine and helps to compile a cluster bomb database for Human Rights Watch. ""I think I'm sort of a hybrid between an analyst, a researcher and an archivist,"" Higgins says. ""One thing, I don't consider myself a journalist. I find things that I want journalists to make use of themselves."" But as far removed from the war as Higgins is, the images of war can still be disturbing. He never watches these videos with his daughter in the room and he tends to play them with the sound turned down. He shows CNN video of a 4-year old being handed an AK-47, his tiny finger on the trigger. ""Some of the videos are disturbing just because of content. It sort of amazes me the sort of footage you see. Some of it is incredible."" He shows another video where his talent for weapons spotting reveals a terrifying image. ""This is a group of children and that's a 240mm mortar that's not exploded and that's the largest kind of mortar in use today. Look, they're kicking at it.""","Elliot Higgins sifts through Syria battle videos to identify weapons .

"(CNN) -- Merrill Newman -- the 85-year-old American detained by North Korean authorities earlier this fall -- has been ""deported,"" North Korea's state news agency KCNA reported early Saturday. His son announced late Friday that he is on his way home to the United States. ""We are absolutely delighted to confirm that Merrill Newman is on his way home,"" Jeff Newman said. A senior Obama administration official said soon after the North Korean announcement that U.S. authorities have Newman ""in hand."" State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf subsequently tweeted that U.S. Embassy officials met ""Newman at the airport in Beijing and provided all appropriate consular assistance."" Video showed him smiling as he walked past a cavalcade of reporters through the Chinese capital's airport. The out-of-the-blue release became all the more real for Newman's relatives in the United States shortly before 8 p.m. (11 p.m. ET), when they talked with Merrill by phone, his family said. The KCNA report stated that investigators determined that ""Newman entered the DPRK with a wrong understanding of it and perpetrated a hostile act against it."" ""Taking into consideration his admittance of the act committed by him on the basis of his wrong understanding (and the) apology made by him for it, his sincere repentance of it and his advanced age and health condition, the above-said institution deported him from the country from a humanitarian viewpoint,"" the official North Korean report added. On Thursday, Harf said American officials had spoken the previous day with relatives of Newman and Kenneth Bae, another American being held in North Korea, but added little else. Hours later, Harf issued a statement saying Washington was ""pleased that Mr. Merrill Newman has been allowed to depart the DPRK and rejoin his family."" ""We welcome the DPRK's decision to release him. This positive decision by the DPRK throws into sharper relief the continuing detention of ... Bae,"" she added. ""... We call on the DPRK once again to pardon and grant Mr. Bae special amnesty and immediately release him as a humanitarian gesture so that he too can return home to his family."" Coincidence or not, the news of Newman's release came on the day that Vice President Joe Biden was in South Korea, where he was to lay a wreath at a memorial for veterans of the war that pitted North Korea against its southern neighbor as well as the United States. Biden told reporters in South Korea that he ""played no direct role"" in the release. He added that his office offered to let Newman fly home with him on Air Force Two, but State Department officials said he'd take a direct commercial flight to San Francisco. ""It's a positive thing they've done,"" said the vice president, who talked Saturday morning by phone with Newman, according to another Obama administration official. ""But they still have Mr. Bae, who has no reason being held in the North (and) should be released immediately."" Former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, who has undertaken private diplomatic efforts with North Korea seemed more perturbed over Newman's detention than he was pleased at his release. ""While the release of Merrill Newman is welcome news indeed, he never should have been detained in the first place. The North Koreans should also release Kenneth Bae as a humanitarian gesture,"" Richardson said in a statement. According to his family, Newman went on a 10-day organized private tour of North Korea in October. From phone calls and postcards he sent, the trip was going well and there was no indication of any kind of problem, son Jeff Newman said. The day before the Palo Alto, California, resident was to leave, ""one or two Korean authorities"" met with Newman and his tour guide, the son added. They talked about Newman's service record, which left ""my dad ... a bit bothered,"" according to Jeff Newman. Then, just minutes before his Beijing-bound plane was set to depart Pyongyang in late October, he was taken off the aircraft by North Korean authorities. For weeks, the Pyongyang government didn't explain why they were holding Newman. An explanation came a few days ago, when state media published and broadcast what they described as the Korean War veteran's ""apology."" In fact, that word -- ""apology"" -- was written atop the first of four handwritten pages detailing his alleged indiscretions. In the note -- which was dated November 9 -- Newman talked about his having advised the Kuwol Unit, part of the ""intelligence bureau"" fighting against Pyongyang during the Korean War. He detailed how he commanded troops to collect ""information"" and wage various deadly attacks. ""After I killed so many civilians and (North Korean) soldiers and destroyed strategic objects in the DPRK during the Korean War, I committed indelible offensive acts against the DPRK government and Korean people,"" Newman said, according to that KCNA report. The reported message also touched on his return 60 years later to North Korea, admitting that he ""shamelessly ... had a plan to meet any surviving soldiers and pray for the souls of the dead soldiers."" His statement ended: ""If I go back to (the) USA, I will tell the true features of the DPRK and the life the Korean people are leading."" This public apology -- which University of California, Berkeley, professor Steve Weber characterized as ""highly scripted political theater"" -- left some wondering what would happen to Newman. Would he join Bae, an American arrested in North Korea in November 2012 who last May was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor after North Korea's government found him guilty of ""hostile acts"" and attempts to topple the government? Or would he be released? As Weber said days ago: ""When it comes to North Korea, nobody knows very much."" Pyongyang has long been regarded by many as a repressive state, with its insularity, sharp restrictions on speech and other freedoms, and decades of saber-rattling primarily targeting its chief foes, South Korea and the United States. Its isolation is exacerbated by widespread uproar over its nuclear program. The East Asian nation's reported quest to create a nuclear weapon, as well as its resistance to international monitoring of its activities, have resulted in economic sanctions, compounding difficulties in getting enough energy and food for its people. But there have been some indications of change of late. Is Newman's release signal even more of an opening by Pyongyang? Will it lead to even more of a thaw? Given the ups and mostly downs in these relationships, it's hard to tell now what will happen. Still, this news affects the global political landscape, at the least it appears that the Newman family -- including Merrill's wife, Lee, who last month told CNN that ""we need to have Merrill back at the head of the table for the holidays"" -- should be complete once again. CNN's Jill Dougherty and Joseph Netto contributed to this report.","NEW: Newman's son confirms that the released American is on his way home .

"(CNN) -- The first time I met Nelson Mandela was almost exactly 20 years ago. It was my first week in the Clinton administration and I had joined a trip to South Africa with my boss, Commerce Secretary Ron Brown. South Africa had yet to complete its transition to representative democracy, yet to put the stain of apartheid behind it. But the transformation had started. A reception was held for our delegation and Mandela was present. Charismatic, preternaturally graceful and dignified, he quietly chatted with each member of the group, posing for photos, smiling. One can only imagine how discordant his new role as hero and dignitary and certain future president was with his fairly recent past as a prisoner. But on a rolling green lawn in an elegant setting, he was the still center of the universe for all present. This father of change seemed to embody the unchanging, the enduring. I stood to the side, not wanting to get between him and the visiting CEOs and dignitaries. After a while, he and Brown seemed to notice that I was at the edge of the gathering, clearly shy. They exchanged a word or two and then Ron beckoned me over. He introduced me to Mandela and for just a few minutes the three of us spoke. This would be a better story if I remembered a word of what was said. But I don't. I just remember that Mandela took the time, made the connection, seemed to listen to what I was saying and that at the end of it all, he said, ""Thank you for coming to South Africa."" The notion of him thanking me for anything, even as a polite gesture, was absurd. Of all the leaders I have known in my life, and it has been my good fortune to meet quite a few, none conveyed leadership as effortlessly. While he had yet to achieve his apotheosis -- the moment when the old South African regime ended and he, its onetime victim, was elevated to preside over a new, hopeful, incomparably more equitable era -- even by the time I met him, he had achieved a unique status on the world stage. He had made his remarkable journey and achieved victory in his nonviolent way. He had entered history and hearts worldwide. He didn't need an election to lead his people. He simply led. He inspired. But there was something more. Mandela was a great symbol, but he was elevated further still by a particular moment in the history of the planet. Seven years earlier, in the Philippines, Corazon Aquino had led the People Power Revolution that ousted the Marcos regime. Three years after that, people crowded Tiananmen Square and sent the unmistakable message that China must change. They were put down, but their spirit so endures that the memory of their uprising still galvanizes the Chinese people and puts fear in the heart of many in the Chinese leadership. And just a few months after that the Velvet Revolution toppled the Communist regime in Czechoslovakia. Elsewhere throughout the former Soviet Union, pillars of its strength were crumbling and by 1991, that onetime superpower had fallen. Mandela had been released from prison in February 1990. Imagine the upheaval in those years. The unshakable had been shaken. The unbreakable had been broken. Those whose power seemed unassailable had been deposed by those who had moments earlier seemed powerless. Mandela was the avatar of an era that reminded us that history is made by men and women of courage and that it can dismiss in the blinking of an eye all that seems unchanging. Mandela is a symbol of resistance to apartheid. He is a father to his country. But he was also a powerful symbol of the times in which he lived. He was hope incarnate. He was a message to all those brought down by injustice that no matter what the odds, no matter how impossible ultimate victory may seem, not to give up. Today, many lament the injustices and grave errors of these times. Growing inequality. Enduring racism. Insensitivity to the frailties of our planet. Oppression of countless groups, simply because of ethnic origin or religious beliefs or because they are women. We are frustrated that our governments seem to have lost their ability to govern. We worry that we are unable to rise to the challenges of our moment. And so in the death of Mandela comes yet another of his gifts to the world: a reminder not only of what he did but of the stunning changes that swept the world in the time of his triumph. It is a coda to a great life, a reminder to cast aside resignation and defeatism and know that great hearts do exist. And they sometimes do make the impossible happen. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Rothkopf.","David Rothkopf met Mandela after he was freed from prison .

"(RollingStone.com) -- The toy company behind the viral advertisement that used a parody of the song ""Girls"" to mock stereotyped toys for young women has filed a lawsuit fighting copyright infringement claims by the Beastie Boys. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Goldieblox filed their suit in California federal court on Thursday seeking a declaratory judgment that the video falls within fair use. GoldiBlox, which makes engineering and construction toys targeted to girls, sparked widespread discussion about gender stereotyping in children's toys when it posted the video on Monday. The ad features three young girls building an elaborate Rube Goldberg machine while singing the Beastie Boys' 1986 hit with the lyrics changed to express their dissatisfaction with conventional girls' toys. RS: See where 'Licensed to Ill' ranks among the 100 best debut album of all time . ""You think you know what we want -- girls/ Pink and pretty it's girls/ Just like the fifties it's girls/ You like to buy us pink toys/ And everything else is for boys."" The video has been viewed more than seven and a half million times on YouTube. GoldieBlox claims in the lawsuit that the Beastie Boys have threatened the company with copyright infringement.

"Las Vegas (CNN) -- After six days, 3,250 booths and 20,000 new products, a few interesting trends bubbled up at last week's Consumer Electronics Show. There were plenty of generic 5-inch smartphones, cheap tablets and ginormous televisions, as well as prototypes of fun, futuristic technology like the 20-inch 4K tablet from Panasonic or the self-driving car from Audi. We also spotted plenty of odd gear, like the manicure machine that can print photos on your nails and the mind-controlled helicopter. And we learned a few things about where consumer tech is going in 2013. Here are six trends that caught our eye. Transportation for people who hate walking . Shiny, futuristic smart cars were on display from big companies such as Audi, Toyota and Ford. They showed off self-driving car prototypes and in-car displays for reading maps, playing music and even checking social networks. But some of the more inventive transportation tech was smaller and geekier. There was the ZBoard, a motorized skateboard that senses your weight to propel you in the right direction, going up to 15 miles per hour. The eFlow E3 Nitro Electric bike will set lazy bikers back $4,000. People wearing electric roller skates and strange two-wheeled boots zipped around the show floor at low speeds. The Solowheel electric unicycle actually looked like a lot of fun, but at $1,795, you might be better off catching a few cabs. Overhyped pricey TVs . Televisions are the biggest product category at the Consumer Electronics Show, with major companies such as Samsung, Sharp, Sony and Panasonic using the occasion to launch their latest and greatest screens. The big hardware feature pushed at last week's show was the Ultra High-Definition 4K screen, which offers a crisper picture than traditional HD displays. While the technology is closer to being available to consumers, it's still mostly just hype. The prices are sky-high for 4K TVs, and you'll notice the difference only if you're sitting close to the set or if you spring for a giant television measuring 60 inches or larger. Even if you can afford a 4K TV, there's not much in the way of content for the medium yet. Crowdfunded gadgets . The crowd-funding and conference worlds merged nicely at this year's CES. Companies that got their start on Kickstarter or Indiegogo, like the people who made the Pebble smart watch, managed to parlay that early momentum into higher visibility at the show. Crowdfunding sites also are proving to be more than just great ways to raise money; they're places where people with offbeat inventions can test the waters to see whether there's a market for their product. And then there were the startups with protoypes that announced plans to raise money on crowdfunding sites in the coming months. One CES darling was the HAPIfork, a ""smart"" fork that tallies how many bites you take in order to help fast eaters slow down. The product has received a lot of press, both adoring and mocking, which should help it rake in money when it debuts on Kickstarter this spring. Help for senior citizens . The elderly tend to get overlooked in the tech world, but this year's CES featured a surprising number of products aimed at the grandparent set. Connected smart-home devices make it possible to monitor family members from far away, which can be comforting to primary caregivers dealing with aging parents. New sensors can text family members or a doctor if something is amiss in the senior's daily routine, such as not getting out of bed or skipping medication. If you're concerned about an elderly relative's safety, you can use smartphone apps to remotely control security systems, thermostats and even kitchen electronics. For people in poor health, sensors and gadgets will monitor vital signs and send alerts if someone needs assistance right away. In case of emergency . Whether inspired by Hurricane Sandy or ""The Walking Dead,"" a number of intriguing gadgets promised to help users handle emergencies. The Luci inflatable lantern, for example, is both solar-powered and waterproof. Also popular were mobile-charging devices that offer backup power on the go for smartphones and tablets. These battery packs can be pricey, though. The solar-powered Yeti 150 generator has enough juice to power a smartphone for 15 hours, but it will cost you $400. The junk . CES is huge, spanning 1.92 million square feet. For every interesting gadget or prototype, there were dozens of small booths hawking digital detritus. Though Apple doesn't have an official presence at CES, the iPhone accessory was a popular item on the show floor, There was a neverending supply of cheap cases, covers, Bluetooth keyboards, power packs and charging stations for iPhone and iPads. Speakers and headphones were as omnipresent as flu germs. Some big companies introduced cool audio products, but the big trend continued to be celebrity-endorsed headphones. Beats by Dre has done so well that every earbud now clamors for some famous support, even from the likes of MotÃ¶rhead frontman Lemmy Kilmister or, um, ""The Jersey Shore's"" Snooki. Finally, there were the massagers. There wasn't anything terribly innovative or new in the massage field, but the booths demoing massage tech were always packed with stressed-out or weary attendees who needed a little back rub after wandering the show floor all day. The latest trend in this field? Little robot massagers that wander around on your back. We'll find out soon enough whether they catch on in the real world.","20,000 new products were showcased at the Consumer Electronics Show .

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. ambassador to Syria visited the embattled town of Hama Thursday as part of what the State Department called an effort to show U.S. support for Syrians fighting for democracy. Ambassador Robert Ford visited Hama ""to make absolutely clear with his physical presence that we stand with those Syrians who are expressing their right to speak for change,"" said State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland. Hama has been wracked with violence and a general strike this week after a series of peaceful demonstrations, including a huge anti-government demonstration last Friday. A fierce crackdown ensued in the area, with activists and Human Rights Watch reporting many arrests and deaths. President Bashar al-Assad fired the Hama provincial governor Saturday and security forces removed tanks to the outskirts of the city, a sign that the tensions there could be easing. Ambassador Ford met with over a dozen Hama residents and visited a hospital that has treated some of those wounded in the security forces crackdown, Nuland said, adding that he was greeted with a ""very warm welcome."" The state news agency SANA reported that a Foreign Ministry source accused Ford of going to Hama without obtaining prior permission from the government. According to the report, the Foreign Ministry official said Ford's visit was ""clear evidence of the U.S. involvement in the ongoing events in Syria and its bids to aggravate the situations which destabilize Syria.'' Nuland, however, said U.S. officials notified the Syrian government that an embassy team was traveling to Hama. ""The embassy informed Syrian officials that an embassy delegation, without specifying whom, would be heading to Hama. And they then proceeded to make their way there and were allowed to proceed,"" Nuland said. Ford's delegation did not include any official Syrian ""handlers,"" Nuland said, adding that Syrian authorities allowed him through check points to reach the town. ""For him to go personally at this time and stand with the people of Hama, I think expresses in physical terms -- not to mention political terms -- our view that the people of Hama have the right to express themselves peacefully and that we are concerned about the posture that the security forces have taken,"" Nuland said, adding that Ford plans to stay through protests planned on Friday. It is unclear whether Hama residents will turn out for nationwide demonstrations on Friday after Muslim prayers. Last month, Hama was the site of violent crackdowns by security forces that killed 60 protesters. The city is a sensitive spot for Syrian authorities. In 1982, it was the scene of a brutal military crackdown targeting Sunni Muslims by the Alawite-dominated government of Hafez al-Assad, the current president's late father. Thousands were killed, with Human Rights Watch putting the toll at 10,000.","NEW: The State Department says Syrian authorities were told of the planned visit .

"(CNN) -- The bleary-eyed caveman is furious. He's been waiting for ages for a file to download only to be failed by slow internet speeds. Frustrated, he slaps his computer screen and then slumps down defeated on his seat. Behind him, another caveman connected to high-speed internet pokes fun at him. Showing off, he clicks a button and downloads his favorite song in just a couple of seconds before bursting into a highly entertaining dance. Featuring what has become one of Kenya's most popular TV characters, this catchy and memorable 3D ad for the Faiba internet service went viral in the East African country when it was first aired last year. And this was exactly what animator Michael Muthiga hoped to achieve when he created it for Kenyan telecommunications operator Jamii Telecommunications Limited (JTL). ""Firstly, it was the fact that it was a new medium of advertising and people didn't expect it,"" says Muthiga, director at Fatboy Animations, citing the reasons for the ad's popularity. ""Second, the creativity in it and the story, the whole concept, it was a funny one. Thirdly, we actually sat down to decide how we wanted this character to look and I think that went a long way also in making it a big success."" Read this: Kenya's politicians in 3D animation . The popularity of that first ad spurred the creation of a whole new series of cavemen ads, which in turn helped JTL to become a household name. ""I think it gave a freshness that then got people thinking and saying, 'these guys have brought on something that is new to the market, let's give them a chance,'"" says Cyrus Sang of JTL. ""That gave us the advantage."" But this gain did not come cheap. Creating a 3D animation commercial in Kenya will set a company back several thousand dollars. ""We spent, I mean, quite a huge sum on this advertising project and it was worth every penny that we put into it,"" says Sang. Read this: Africa's mobile tech startups . Though 3D animation is nothing new in Kenya, it has not been widely used in TV commercials. But after the big success of the five-part animated cavemen series, Muthiga says that the industry is now growing at a fast pace. ""As far as advertising is concerned 3D animation is booming,"" says Muthiga. ""Most clients want to go that way, animation -- whatever creates a buzz with the audience, that's what the client will want to go for,"" he adds. The emphasis on advertising is also a sign of a changing and improved economic environment. According to the World Bank, the Kenyan economy expanded by 4.6% last year, in line with a wider trend that sees many African countries routinely among the fastest growing economies in the world. This big growth potential is increasingly attracting profit-seeking international investors. Read this: Africa's smartphone future . Cynthia Nyamai, a Kenyan public relations consultant says that the new players in the field are shrinking the market share and forcing local companies to spend bigger sums to be more visible. ""For a very long time in the African markets, and also in Kenya, people didn't really take advertising that seriously,"" she says. ""In fact, if you look at most companies, when it comes to advertising, when it comes to their budget, unfortunately advertising used to take a very small percentage,"" adds Nyamai. ""This is a market and new people are coming in so they need to be heard, they're fighting for the same market space so a lot of companies now have to spend more in advertising."" This can only be good news for people like Muthiga. The young animator says the only way is up for the industry as it has only scratched the surface. ""We've just tapped into a very small segment of the animation industry, very tiny,"" he says. ""There's so much which we can do which we still haven't done and I believe in my lifetime, and the lifetime of my company we might not even get to do half of the whole industry.""","3D advertisements are becoming increasingly popular in Kenya .

"(CNN) -- A 19-year-old Detroit woman who was shot and killed on the front porch of a home was not shot at close range, according to an autopsy report. Police have said that the homeowner's shotgun accidentally discharged, shooting Renisha McBride in the face. Lawyers for McBride say she was simply looking for help after a car crash, while those representing the homeowner say the 54-year-old was justified in his actions. As reported by the Detroit News, McBride's autopsy left many questions unanswered. It confirmed that McBride had been shot in the face, but revealed little about how the early morning incident on November 2 unfolded. ""There was an entrance shotgun wound to the face, with no evidence of close range discharge of a firearm noted on the skin surrounding this wound,"" said the autopsy report, which ruled her death a homicide. Police said McBride was in a car accident earlier that morning, but that hours passed between the crash and the time of her death. A woman told police that she helped McBride after the car crash, but that McBride said she wanted to go home and walked away from the scene, the Detroit News reported. The wreck happened about 1:30 a.m. and the shooting at 3:40 a.m. The homeowner, whose name has not been released, has said that he was awakened before dawn and believed someone was trying to break into his home.","The autopsy report of Renisha McBride is released .

"(CNN) -- The co-owner of a supply company. An insurance broker. The director of housing preservation and development. A sales broker. A probation officer. A high school teacher. A computer systems analyst. They are seven guys headed to the Baltimore-Cleveland NFL game on Thursday night. At the beginning of the week it didn't look like they'd make it. But thanks to a new contract with the NFL, veteran officials will work the game. Those seven men have a second, part-time job as NFL officials. Referee Gene Steratore and his six officials have been given the assignment of replacing the replacement refs, whose three weeks during the regular season produced many memorable moments, the kind that made fans and players actually wish for the old officials to come back. Goodell apologizes to fans . But it's not like the 121 NFL officials who had been locked out of the league were just sitting on the couch all day. Most officials have a primary job, though a few are retired. And what they really do for a living varies from airline pilot to claims adjuster to sporting goods store owner to educator. One of the NFL's best known referees, Ed Hochuli, a partner at a law firm in Phoenix, told ESPN's John Clayton earlier this month that officials often spend as many as 30 hours a week during the season at their part-time gigs. Factor in travel to games and meetings and it can be as many as 50 hours, said Hank Zaborniak, who was a fill-in official during the lockout. SI: NFL's most embarrassing moments . They watch film for hours, have to take a weekly rules test and read what are called case books -- thick binders full of plays that give guidance on rules. And there's also conditioning. SI: Hochuli gives inside peek at typical play . There are 17 crews in the NFL, so weekends like this, when four teams have the week off, there are only 15 games. The crews that don't work don't get paid. And it can be a very hard job to get. A quick scan of the 2012 roster of officials showed there are no rookies, and only 21 officials had five years or fewer of NFL experience. Most have been in the league for 10 years or more. Line judge Tom Barnes is in his 27th season. According to the league's website, applicants need to have 10 years of officiating experience, five of which must be above the high school level. The career path generally is work as a high school official, get some big game assignments, get hired by a college league and apply for an NFL position. And wait for the call. Points of contention in negotiations . For Zaborniak, it never worked out despite 15 years in with the Big Ten and 12 years at lower-division leagues. Work had something to do with that. He has been assistant commissioner at the Ohio High School Athletic Association for 17 years. For Steratore it did work out. A former college quarterback, he told the New York Times that he jumped into football officiating in 1983 and spent time as a Big East official. Eventually he was hired by the NFL in 2003 as a field judge and became a referee three years later. He also officiates college basketball, the only NFL referee to do so. So he's very used to being in the spotlight, being booed and jeered. On Thursday night, he and his six co-workers will be back at their second jobs, and for a change, there probably will be some cheers in the air. SI's Don Banks: Pressure is on for real refs .","For most NFL officials, this is their weekend job .
It's a hard profession to break into with only 121 spots .
Most start out officiating high school games .

"(CNN) -- CNN Latino, the Spanish-language programming block custom-made for the U.S. Hispanic market, is expanding to New York, Orlando, Tampa and Phoenix, CNN en Español announced today. ""We are taking the power of the CNN brand with all the content from around the world and customizing it for different shows and blocks for CNN Latino,"" said Cynthia Hudson, senior vice president and general manager of CNN en Español and Hispanic Strategy for CNN/U.S. CNN en Español's ""Conclusiones"" and ""Cala"" are the only shows that are repurposed for CNN Latino. ""We believe that CNN Latino programming is a great alternative to the current offering of Hispanic broadcast content in the U.S.,"" said Hudson. These four markets -- in addition to the existing local channel in the Los Angeles area -- will serve markets that represent about a quarter of Hispanic households. This growing population, at more than 50 million, with spending power of $1 trillion by 2015 is projected to represent 30% of the U.S. population by 2050, according to Forbes. ""Sin Limites,"" hosted by Elizabeth Espinosa, will continue to be CNN Latino's production for the Los Angeles market. Why CNN Latino will be different from every other Latino media outlet . CNN Latino signed with WBQM-LD Channel 3, a low-power television station in New York, the second-largest Hispanic market with 1,360,660 Hispanic TV households that account for about 18 % of total households. The joint venture will carry the CNN Latino eight-hour programming block from 3-11 p.m. ET, as well as its current mix of local production and programming from Latin American partners, including shows from ColorVisión Channel 9 in the Dominican Republic, Jorge Barón Televisión in Colombia and RBC Televisión in Perú. CNN Latino brings in LA's Elizabeth Espinosa . In Orlando, CNN Latino will be carried on WATV-LV Channel 47.1, which covers the area of Orlando, Kissimmee, Sanford and Poinciana. Orlando is ranked 17th among Hispanic TV markets and has over 232,000 Hispanic TV households. In Tampa, CNN Latino will be carried on WTAM Chanel 30.1, which covers the area of Tampa, Clearwater, St. Petersburg, Bradenton, Sarasota, Zephyrhills, Brandon and Riverview. Tampa is ranked 19th among Hispanic TV markets and has more than 220,000 Hispanic TV households. ""For many years, the Central Florida region has been anxiously waiting to watch high-quality Hispanic television outside of the traditional novelas, dramas and game shows which narrowly defines the interests of Hispanics,"" said Francisco Moll, SIMA Communications Operations Manager and business partner of Tampa. SIMA partners are also part of the TMA-TIG joint venture. All the affiliated stations will transmit CNN Latino programming, including ""Sin Límites con Elizabeth Espinosa,"" ""Panorama USA,"" ""Cala,"" ""Magazine CNN,"" ""Archivo CNN,"" ""Nuestro Mundo,"" ""Cruzando Fronteras,"" ""Showbiz Latino,"" ""Contrastes,"" ""Dra. Azaret,"" ""Deportes USA"" and other original content for the U.S. Hispanic market. These new markets will join the likes of News Corp and Colombia's RCN Television, which are behind the Spanish-language network MundoFox, and ABC News/Univision (now Fusion) in launching a 24-hour English-language network, all aimed at the U.S. Hispanic audience.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan has released Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, one of the founding members of the Afghan Taliban, foreign ministry spokesman Aizaz Chaudhry told CNN on Saturday. Baradar, who had been held in a secret location, used to be the organization's second-in-command, after Mullah Mohammed Omar himself. ""Afghan President's office welcomes the release of Mullah Baradar from jail in Pakistan,"" Aimal Faizi, spokesman for Afghan President Hamid Karzai, said on Twitter. Pakistani officials this month announced their plans to release Baradar ""in principle."" Baradar was captured in 2010 in Karachi, Pakistan's largest city, which is known to be a haven for many militants from across the country and its bordering regions. This is the second peaceful overture by the newly elected Pakistani government to neighboring Afghanistan. On September 7, it released seven Taliban figures to facilitate the peace process. That release came just two weeks after Afghan President Hamid Karzai visited the capital of Islamabad and stressed Pakistan's assistance in a path to peace. Karzai has long pushed for Baradar's release; his government was suspected to be in secret talks with the wanted militant when he was captured. The Afghan Taliban said this month that it welcomed the Pakistani government's plan to release Baradar and that it was assessing the wider situation. ""Pakistan's move to release seven top commanders at the weekend and plans to release Mullah Baradar is a positive development. We'll respond as things shape up over the coming days and weeks,"" spokesman Zabiullah Muajhid told CNN at the time. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad, Meghan Gregonis, had said Pakistan and Afghanistan should have proper coordination to ""ensure releases are effected in a responsible manner."" Baradar had been under United Nations sanctions since February 2001, with his assets frozen and travel banned. The U.N. had forbidden selling weapons to him.","Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar was a founding member .

"New York (CNN) -- The New York Stock Exchange conducted an electronic systems test Saturday in preparation for Twitter's highly anticipated initial public offering. Only a small number of people were on the trading floor for the test, which NYSE spokesman Eric Ryan called successful. The exchange tested connectivity and running data and did a simulated auction. ""We're grateful to all the firms that chose to participate. We are being very methodical in our planning for Twitter's IPO, and are working together with the industry to ensure a world class experience for Twitter, retail investors and all market participants."" The date of the IPO hasn't been announced. In a regulatory filing earlier this month, Twitter set a preliminary price range of $17 to $20 per share for its IPO, though that price could change. Twitter will have to set its final price the night before it begins trading. The IPO price, however, is really meant for institutional investors such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which can purchase shares directly from the Twitter IPO's underwriters. Regular investors will get their first chance to buy Twitter the following day, when shares will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker ""TWTR."" Twitter's choice to go with NYSE was considered a snub to the tech-heavy Nasdaq exchange, which caught major heat for the massive fumbling of Facebook's IPO last year. Facebook was the most anticipated IPO of 2012 and one of the largest ever for a tech company, but an array of problems and misjudgments led to a botched IPO in May, and the company's stock plummeted. The initial offer price of $38 was too high, too many shares were issued, its opening day was marred by Nasdaq's technical glitches and underwriter Morgan Stanley was fined for improperly influencing share sales. Facebook's stock has since recovered and is now trading above $50, helped in large part by its swift success in selling ads on mobile devices.","NYSE wanted to avoid a repeat of Nasdaq's Facebook bungle .

"(CNN) -- Toronto Mayor Rob Ford, infamous for admitting he smoked crack and drank too much, called allegations that he tried to buy an incriminating video from criminal suspects ""an outright lie"" on the Washington-based Sports Junkies talk radio show Thursday morning. Ford's saga began in May, when allegations emerged that he appeared to be smoking crack cocaine on a pipe on cell phone video taken months earlier, in the winter of 2012. After initially denying that he smoked the drug, he admitted in November that he did. On the show, when asked about how he handles all the media attention he's received in the past few months, Ford said he is staying focused on serving his constituents. ""All the other stuff is nonsense,"" he said. Ford got testy with the hosts when they asked him about the tape, telling them that they could talk to his lawyers if they wanted to keep asking him questions about controversy. ""I'm here to talk about football,"" he said. Ford described what a huge pigskin fan he is. He said that his home is full of football jerseys and regalia, and that he used to play center. He also said he has a football pool in his mayoral office. Documents: Criminal suspects claimed Ford tried to buy damaging video . The hosts asked him if he is a fan of online poker, and he enthusiastically said he is, and then told the hosts that if they came to Toronto, he would treat them like ""kings,"" and maybe they'd go out for chicken wings. The hosts asked him what the future holds for him. The ""future is I'm getting re-elected,"" Ford replied. The hosts asked if Ford has the support of the people. ""Absolutely,"" he answered. Asked who is running against him in the October 27, 2014, election, he said, ""I don't know. There's a ton of names out there."" Then he added: ""The more the merrier. Let my record speak for itself."" Mayor Rob Ford: A man of contrasts . Allegations about damaging tape . The sports radio interview aired a day after the release of documents that say Ford tried to buy a damaging tape from criminal suspects -- months before a tape was publicized showing him smoking crack. That's according to documents CNN obtained from Ontario Crown Counsel Arielle Elbaz that are tied to a Canadian investigation into organized crime called Project Traveller. Ford wasn't the focus of this investigation, and he has not been charged with a crime. But, after allegedly interacting with several players who were involved in the probe, he ended up getting ensnared in it. Ford vows 'outright war' after council strips his powers . The mayor's camp did not return a CNN request for comment. According to the documents, police translating a March 27 phone conversation, primarily from the Somali language, believed that the men were talking about ""receiving an offer from Rob Ford in exchange for a video."" The men discussed an apparent offer of $5,000 and a car in exchange for the video, as well as selling the tape to the Toronto Star newspaper and an unnamed website. The court documents state: ""At the end of the discussion, (one of the men) said he does not want to go to the media but would just see him (believed to be referring to Ford), ... He says he'll ask for 100 or 150"" -- possibly referring to $100,000 or $150,000. These conversations don't delve into specifics about what's on the video. But earlier this year, allegations surfaced in two media outlets that Ford had been recorded last winter using crack cocaine. In May, the Star and the website Gawker published stories saying their reporters saw 90 seconds of a cell phone video showing Ford, as the Star described it, ""inhaling from what appears to be a glass crack pipe."" Later in the video -- as described by the Star -- an ""incoherent"" man both the Star and Gawker claimed was Ford ranted about a number of subjects. After that report came out, Ford said he had no reason to resign. Yet pressure on him increased earlier this fall when Toronto's police chief announced investigators had recovered a video that purportedly showed Ford smoking from a crack pipe. The next week, on November 5, Ford admitted that he'd ""smoked crack cocaine ... probably in one of my drunken stupors, probably approximately about a year ago."" He denied being an addict. Even after this admission, Ford refused to resign. Instead, he vowed ""outright war"" on the city council when, later in the month, it slashed the mayor's budget and transferred most of his duties to the deputy mayor. ""If you think American-style politics is nasty, you guys have just attacked Kuwait,"" Ford said then to groans and laughter in the city council chambers. The mayor's voice is less apparent in the documents released Wednesday, although he is not necessarily insignificant. Authorities say that phone intercepts from early on April 20, for instance, indicate one woman telling a man ""that Rob Ford is at the residence."" Two minutes later, at 12:54 a.m., another man allegedly tells the first ""to go to Princess's ... house to deliver drugs to Rob Ford,"" the court documents say. Ford on controversial team names . Whenever the Washington, D.C., radio hosts asked Ford about his political life Thursday, he tried to steer the conversation back to sports. ""Mayor, what is your link to the Redskins -- 'cause your people have told us that you actually were a Skins fan or you went to Skins camp?"" Ford said he went to a youth football camp in Pennsylvania for three years that was staffed, at least in part, by Redskins players. ""These guys literally taught us how to play football -- banging on your door at 7 a.m. It was great discipline at a young age, so I went back there three years in a row."" One of the hosts asked him what he thought about opposition to the name Redskins, which some think is offensive to Native Americans. ""Why don't we look at the Cleveland Indians,"" Ford replied. ""What are we gonna call them next, the Cleveland Aboriginals? Like, where do we go with this? It's been around for years and years and years and if they were offended they should have come out when the name was first initiated. You started playing -- how long have the Skins had their name for? How long have the Chiefs had their name for? How long have the Cleveland Indians had their name for? Years and years and years and all of a sudden the politically correct people have to come out now? I think everything's fine and I would just stick with the name.""","Toronto mayor denies trying to buy an incriminating video from criminal suspects .

"(CNN) -- Before the distressing 911 call even connects, the caller breathes heavily. ""I need an ambulance. Oh my God. Please hurry,"" the caller says. That's the agitated voice of Michael Tuller, the owner of Wild Cat Haven Sanctuary in Clackamas County, Oregon, a private place that houses some 60 big cats. He discovered the lifeless body of head keeper Renee Radziwon-Chapman, 36, inside an enclosure Saturday. The 911 tapes, released this week, tell of the horror.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- One of the largest Jewish cemeteries in the Los Angeles area has agreed to an $80.5 million settlement of a lawsuit that accused it of desecrating remains, according to court documents. The suit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, alleged that employees at Eden Memorial Park, in Mission Hills, California, ""intentionally, willfully and secretly desecrated the remains of deceased individuals,"" often moving them to make room for new remains. The cemetery is owned by Service Corporation International, or SCI, the largest owner of cemeteries in the United States. The court granted preliminary approval of the settlement Thursday. The case was brought on behalf of more than 25,000 Jewish families, according to plaintiffs' attorneys. ""This settlement is a testament to the thousands of Jewish families who have been traumatized because of the conduct of Eden Memorial Park and SCI,"" lead attorney Michael Avenatti said in a statement. ""We have been honored to represent these families and as promised nearly five years ago, we did not rest until truth prevailed. We are pleased with the settlement and are proud that this lawsuit resulted in SCI immediately changing its business practices at Eden to ensure this never happens to another family again,"" he said. This is not the first time Service Corporation International has faced allegations of digging up graves and moving bodies to make room for new remains. It reached a $100 million settlement with families of victims whose remains were desecrated at Menorah Gardens in Florida. The company also reached a $14 million settlement with the Florida state attorney's office over issues related to those same claims. CNN's Carma Hassan, Abbie Boudreau and Scott Zamost contributed to this report.","The allegations involve employees at Eden Memorial Park, in Mission Hills, California .

"(CNN) -- Cyndi Lauper had a hit in the 1980s called ""Money Changes Everything."" She has a point. It may or may not buy happiness, but money -- especially truckloads of it -- does change things, including endowing the holder of the checkbook with power. Now, take a teenager and give him that power. What happens? Justin Bieber, Lindsay Lohan and the other teen stars that have crashed to earth in a shower of tabloid sparks, may only be doing what a great many teenagers would be doing -- if they could. There are teenagers like Justin Bieber on every block. But imagine the kid who cuts your lawn suddenly having a net worth of about $130 million. The same teen brain that convinces its host that he won't get caught if he throws a party at the house while mom and dad are away now knows it owns the house -- and it's a mansion, with Lamborghinis outside loaned gratis by a friendly dealer. Woohoo! It's long been said that by age 5 or 6, a child's brain is 95% of its adult size. But neuroscientists, enlightened by MRI technology, are discovering it is still changing -- creating connections, adding and shedding cells. That process is particularly active in the prefrontal cortex -- the part that makes judgments like drag racing through residential neighborhoods. Dr. Jay Giedd at the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Maryland, led studies that found the teen brain development was a process of adding and pruning. Significantly, he said, brain cells at that age are influenced by what the teen does. If he plays sports, the brain cells will make connections that help with that. If he sits on the couch and plays video games, then the cells will be hardwired for those activities. The only real moderating influence -- as it is for any teenager -- is the parents. But instilling discipline and values can be a daunting exercise when the child is the breadwinner. It can be difficult to tell your child they can't have the car tonight -- when he's the one who paid for it. Some parents -- like the Lohans -- are simply not up to the job. Others -- like the parents of Britney Spears or Amanda Bynes -- may have had their job complicated by what appear to be mental problems. Unfortunately, today, those problems are there for all to see. Every failure of a troubled celebrity teen spreads like digital wildfire. Still, for every Justin Bieber, there is a Ron Howard, Natalie Portman or Jodie Foster -- child stars who navigated the rocky shoals of teen years into successful adulthood. Actor Rance Howard, in an interview, said he raised well-adjusted child star sons, Clint and Academy-award winning Ron, by removing their money from the family's life. ""We chose not to live on what the boys could afford,"" he said, ""but what I could afford."" Let's hope Justin will find his way. But romping in a mountain of money like most kids play in a pile of leaves, and surrounded by an entourage of dependent cheerleaders, won't make it easy. As the developing cells of his teenage brain react to the world around him -- money does change everything. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Peggy Drexler.","Peggy Drexler: There are teenagers like Justin Bieber on every block .

"(CNN) -- For most people, keeping fit involves an established exercise routine built around a regular weekly schedule. But what if your job involves large amounts of travel? Many people come back from trips away carrying extra pounds from disruption to regular exercise, as well as an increased tendency to overindulge on business dinners paid for on the company card. According to the World Health Organisation, lack of exercise not only impairs your waistline, but can also reduce energy and concentration levels -- the exact qualities that are required when conducting business abroad. Shani Anderson is a personal trainer and managing director of Anderson Fitness Consultants. The British former Olympian says that with the right foresight, it's possible to incorporate a healthy regime wherever and however you travel. 1) Don't treat business travel as a ""holiday"" from your health regime . There's a temptation to regard exercise as a means to looking good on holiday, rather than as an ongoing strategy for health and well-being. ""A lot of people diet or work out to go on holiday. And for me that's a problem, because you have short-term goals,"" says Anderson. ""You switch off when you reach the goal, and your body goes 'great, I'm done' - and in two weeks you're back the way you were before."" According to Anderson, this exemplifies the most common obstacle to keeping fit while traveling: Attitude. People tend to perceive trips away from home as in some way separate from the rest of their lives and that therefore the same rules no longer apply. 2) Prepare and do research . Before you travel, investigate the best locations for your preferred form of exercise. If you're into cycling, see if there's a local bike hire company nearby; if you're a jogger, plan the most scenic route to get the most of your new environment. Anderson's motto is ""plan, plan, plan."" She says that a common trap during hectic business trips is failing to schedule and prioritise your adapted exercise regime before you leave. ""It should be exactly the same process as planning a meeting. You put it in your diary. If you had a meeting at work you would have to be there, it's the same thing"" instructs Anderson. ""It's a mental battle more than anything else."" 3) Bring portable fitness equipment . Sometimes there simply won't be an opportunity to access a gym. If so, there is an extensive range of portable exercise equipment, from simple skip ropes to more sophisticated gadgets -- such as the magnetic tension mini-bike. For Anderson's money, the tiny TRX suspension system is hard to beat. ""It's basically using gravity against your ankle, it's a nice idea. It's completely portable. You can even put it in your handbag. I use it a lot."" 4) Don't overindulge at business dinners . There's no getting away from it -- maintaining a healthy diet during a business trip is a challenge. There's little or no opportunity to prepare your own meals and the most delicious eat-out options will rarely flatter your physique the following day. This, combined with a generous expenses card, is a recipe for disaster. Anderson, though, has a few simple tricks: . ""Instead of using calories, you look at your plate, and put your fist next to your carbohydrate section and it should be the same size,"" she says. ""The size and thickness of your palm is the amount of protein you can eat. So it would be the size of a chicken fillet or turkey."" Additionally, you can prevent yourself gorging out at the end of a long day by making sure you eat small amounts at regular intervals. 'It's all about not getting hungry. People starve themselves thinking it's going help, but it really doesn't, especially if you're travelling,"" explains Anderson. 5) Take advantage of hotel fitness services . Malcolm Hendry is general manager of London's prestigious Hotel 41. They have introduced a ""sports buddy"" program, whereby staff with particular sporting skills are teamed-up with guests keen to keep fit during their stay. ""It came along about seven years ago,"" he says. ""We had two guests that were very keen sports people. But they were single travellers -- and things like playing tennis and squash, you need another person to play with."" His hotel reflects a growing trend within the hospitality industry to provide high quality, bespoke fitness options. ""We think a bit more about the health and fitness of our guests than we did 30 years ago,"" he notes. ""We got a great gym and we got great relationships with local places... and I have about a dozen people on my team who play sports from golf, through horse riding, squash, tennis to cycling."" So, if Hendry has his way, trips abroad will no longer be occasions where you escape from exercise, but where you go especially to keep fit.","Many people come back from trips abroad carrying a few extra pounds .

"(CNN) -- Toronto Mayor Rob Ford said he suffered a ""setback"" this week after a video posted on social media showed him babbling about the city's police chief Monday night while he was at a fast-food restaurant. The mayor, who became infamous for admitting he had smoked crack and drank too much in the past, has said he only had a small amount to drink and didn't take drugs Monday. ""As you know, I'm a human being -- the same as every one of you. And I'm entitled to a personal life, and my personal life does not interfere with the work I do, day-in and day-out, for the taxpayers of this great city,"" he told reporters Wednesday. ""Monday was unfortunate. I had a minor setback. We all experience these difficult bumps in life. I am telling the Toronto residents that I'm still working hard every day to improve my health and my well-being. But again, this is completely a private matter."" The mayor, who has pledged to refrain from alcohol, stopped briefly to talk to reporters Tuesday when he was asked about the video that shows him incoherently talking to customers at a Steak Queen in Rexdale. ""I was with some friends and what I do with my personal life, and with my personal friends, that's up to me,"" he said then. In the video, which lasts 66 seconds, Ford speaks at times in Creole with a Jamaican accent. He is dressed in a suit and tie, with his back to the counter. He uses a profanity at the beginning of the clip to describe Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair. It's the latest embarrassment for Ford. His saga began in May, when allegations emerged that he appeared to be smoking crack cocaine on a pipe on cell phone video taken months earlier, in winter 2012. After initially denying that he had smoked the drug, he admitted in November that he had. The city council later voted to strip him of most of his power as mayor, reducing him to primarily a figurehead. Ford has ignored calls for him to resign or enter rehab and has said he will run for re-election in October.","He speaks after a video shows him babbling about the city's police chief .

"(CNN) -- He started his first business venture as a street vendor with capital of just $200 but two decades later Fomba Trawally has become one of Liberia's most prominent businessmen. Like many in his country, Trawally fled Liberia in 1989 to escape the West African country's ruinous civil war. He found refuge in The Gambia but in December 1991 Trawally decided it was time to return to his native country. Once back in the capital Monrovia, the former refugee quickly realized he could capitalize on a need for one product: rubber flip-flops. ""When the war took place people had to be displaced from another point to another point,"" remembers Trawally, founder of Kumba Beindu and Sons. ""So in the process of that, they don't take their shoes and they walk with their bare feet. And the $200 that I brought from Gambia, I decided to invest that into the slippers."" Read this: 'Nigerian iTunes' dances to the mobile phone beat . That initial investment in rubber flip-flops made quick returns. Trawally's business grew steadily and by 2005 the self-made businessman owned three retail stores selling items such as paper products and cosmetics imported from all over the world. With an entrepreneurial spirit, Trawally next set his sights on making the transition from being an importer to becoming a manufacturer. Thus, in 2010 he launched National Toiletries Incorporated, Liberia's first paper and toiletry product manufacturing company. ""I figured out that our population is about four million,"" he says. ""Out of the four million, no one is producing paper -- everybody is going out to bring the paper to import. Even if two million people buy from me by day, I feel that it's something like we'll grow the economy of this country."" The company's factory became operational earlier this year, producing four different kinds of products: baby diapers, paper towels, napkins and toilet paper. Liberia: From warzone to holiday paradise? With sales having so far reached more than $600,000, Trawally says his plans are to double the factory's capacity by the end of next year. ""Since I started this company with $200 I feel like other people can make it too,"" says Trawally. ""I do not hire family; I personally find citizens, some who have never seen such a machine in their life and I train them and watch them improve. I believe if I can do it, so can they and that's what's gratifying."" Yet, running a manufacturing business in Liberia -- a country torn apart by a civil war that left an estimated 250,000 people dead and destroyed much of its infrastructure and economy -- is not without big challenges. ""Number one, we don't have the power or energy in our country at this time -- we're running on a generator,"" says Trawally. ""You tell anyone that I'm running a factory as big as this only on a generator, they'll tell you that you are crazy,"" he adds. Unreliable power and poor infrastructure, coupled with high energy costs and a lack of skilled labor, are all major problems for entrepreneurs doing business in Liberia. Read this: Guns become weapons of mass creation . But there is one business area Trawally is not concerned about. ""For the challenge of distribution,"" he says, ""I don't have a problem with that."" ""One supermarket in Liberia, Harbel supermarket, they are the number one customer to me -- they don't buy tissue from anyone beside me,"" adds Trawally. ""And out of all the other small shops and centers I already have over 1,500 members."" Looking ahead, Trawally says his next goal is to expand the business outside Liberia. ""I would like to see myself outside of the country,"" he says. ""I want to get other countries in Africa and export to Europe and to American markets. That is my dream.""","Fomba Trawally is a Liberian businessman who started his career as a street vendor .

"(CNN) -- Russian authorities have charged all 30 people aboard a Greenpeace ship with piracy after two activists tried to scale an oil platform in a protest of Arctic drilling last month, the Russian Investigative Committee said Thursday. The charging began Wednesday and finished Thursday. If convicted, the 28 activists and two freelance journalists could be sentenced to up to 15 years in prison. None of the 30, who hail from at least 18 countries, pleaded guilty, the committee said. The defendants include Americans Peter Wilcox, who is the captain of the Arctic Sunrise, and Dmitry Litvinov, who Greenpeace says also holds Swedish citizenship. Greenpeace ship captains defies orders, Russians resort to towing . They were arrested after two of the activists left the Arctic Sunrise and tried to climb the side of an oil platform owned by the Russian energy giant Gazprom in the Barents Sea on September 18. The Russian coast guard detained the pair and the rest of the Arctic Sunrise's crew, and towed the ship to the northwestern Russian port city of Murmansk. Greenpeace said the two activists were trying to hang a banner from the side of the rig in what the group called a peaceful protest against the ""slow but unrelenting destruction of the Arctic."" But Russian authorities accuse them of trying to commandeer the platform. The authorities and Gazprom also say the activists endangered the lives of the company's employees and that their action could have led to an environmental disaster. Lawyers acting on Greenpeace's behalf have filed appeals in court seeking the defendants' release, Greenpeace said Thursday. ""Our activists have been charged with a crime that did not happen. They are accused of an imaginary offense,"" Greenpeace International Executive Director Kumi Naidoo said Thursday. ""There can be no doubt about why the charge of piracy has been brought and the legal hammer wielded. ""An effort is under way to intimidate us, but our peaceful, passionate campaign against Gazprom and all other Arctic drillers will not be silenced."" The charge of piracy is ""over the top,"" Phil Radford, executive director of Greenpeace USA, told CNN earlier this week. ""I think they (Russian prosecutors) will take it all the way to trial,"" Radford said. ""I think Gazprom is using its political muscle to have the courts really crack down on these peaceful protesters. It's a serious and overblown charge. ""They need to have the piracy charge because it's the only way they can save face from illegally arresting these activists and journalists."" Russian President Vladimir Putin has indicated he does not consider the protesters pirates, but Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, quoted in the Russian media, said Wednesday: ""Environmental concerns cannot be used as a cloak for illegal acts no matter what lofty considerations such acts are based on. They cannot manifest themselves in illegal methods or methods that are eventually unsafe for people and technological facilities."" Six protesting Shell by climbing London's Shard arrested .

"(CNN) -- Last spring, the Senate Finance Committee held a hearing on implementation of the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare. Sen. Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat and the chairman of the committee, was not pleased with how things were going. The Obama administration originally had asked for more than half a billion dollars to spend on public relations and outreach for the law. House Republicans had returned with an offer of nothing. That's right: zero dollars. Without necessary funds, the Department of Health and Human Services worried it would not have the necessary money to pay for navigators to help people enroll in health care, for the technology needed to implement the exchanges and for the public relations campaign that was required to inform citizens about what the law actually did. HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius made the controversial move of asking insurance companies and nonprofit organizations to donate money and help. Republicans were outraged. She asked for more money. She was refused. Then, when she tried to move some money from the PR budget to replace cuts to other areas, Baucus became quite upset. He was concerned that if the administration did not do more to inform people about the law and get implementation going, there would be problems: . ""A lot of people have no idea about all of this,"" he said. ""People just don't know a lot about it, and the Kaiser poll pointed that out. I understand you've hired a contractor. I'm just worried that that's gonna be money down the drain because contractors like to make money. ... I just tell ya, I just see a huge train wreck coming down."" As I've said before, it's important to note that the ""train wreck"" Baucus was describing was a botched implementation because not enough was being done to make things go smoothly. It wasn't a description of the law itself but of what might occur if the government did not devote enough resources to making it work. Sebelius' response was not surprising to those who were paying attention. She said that she was ""incredibly disappointed"" that all her requests for resources were being denied by Republicans. That was then. Today, implementation has arrived, and if it's not a train wreck, then it's certainly close. The administration is still under fire because people cannot get the insurance they want through the exchanges. But while I will continue to point out the problems with implementation and fault the administration for mistakes they've made, how does one ignore the apparent hypocrisy from many politicians who are now ""outraged"" about the very problems they've helped to create. Republicans refused to appropriate money needed to implement Obamacare. When Sebelius tried to shift money from other areas to help do what needed to be done, she was attacked by Senate Republicans. At every step, Republicans fought measures to get money to put towards implementation. Is it really a surprise then that implementation hasn't gone smoothly? Federal legislators aren't the only ones to blame. Let's remember that original versions of the bill called for one big national exchange. This would have been much easier to implement. But conservatives declared that insurance should be left to the states and kept out of the hands of the federal government. So as a compromise (yes, those did occur), exchanges were made state-based instead of national. As a precaution, the law stipulated that if states failed to do their duty and enact exchanges, the federal government would step in and pick up the slack. This was to prevent obstructionism from killing the law. Surprisingly, it was many of the same conservative states that demanded local control that refused to implement state-based exchanges, leaving the federal government to do it for them. That made implementation much harder. There have been books, webinars and meetings explaining how to sabotage the implementation of Obamacare. There have been campaigns trying to persuade young adults not to use the exchanges. It is, therefore, somewhat ironic that many of the same people who have been part of all of this obstructionism seem so ""upset"" by the fact that people can't easily use the exchanges. For goodness sake, the government was shut down just a few weeks ago because some of the same people who are now bemoaning poorly functioning websites were determined to see that not one dime went to Obamacare. Lest you think I'm defending this month's rollout, I encourage you to review my last article here. I still maintain that the administration has had a failure in management in overseeing and reporting on progress towards October 1. But I'm also sympathetic that they've had a hard job to do. I would like to see this go better. I'd like to see millions more get insurance. I'd like to see the law of the land function as well as it can, and if it doesn't, I'd like to see Congress continue to amend it to make it work better. I'd like a better health care system. What I cannot ignore, however, are the many people who actively worked to see implementation fail now get the vapors over its poor start. The truth is, they got what they wanted. A victory lap is somewhat warranted, not concern-trolling. If, on the other hand, their concern is real, then I'm sure the administration would welcome their help in making things right. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Aaron Carroll.","Aaron Carroll: Sen. Max Baucus warned of ""train wreck"" in Obamacare implementation .

"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- Imprisoned Ukrainian opposition leader and former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko has ended her 12-day hunger strike, Ukraine's Batkivschyna opposition party said Friday. Tymoshenko's daughter, Eugenia Tymoshenko, visited her mother at the prison where she is held in Kharkov, according to the party. Eugenia said after her visit that her mother is ""very weak now; she almost does not get up from bed. This is because it is her third hunger strike in a short period of time."" Eugenia said many people, including European and world leaders, had asked her mother to stop the hunger strike, according to the Batkivschyna party. But her mother's decision followed a request by protesters who have been demonstrating in Kiev's Independence Square for Ukraine's integration with the European Union, her daughter told the party. ""She stopped her hunger strike upon the request of the people on the square. They asked her to take care of her life, her health, so she could be with us,"" Eugenia Tymoshenko said. The government of President Viktor Yanukovich suspended talks with the European Union last month, angering many Ukrainians who say an EU agreement would have opened borders to trade and set the stage for modernization and inclusion. The subsequent protests are the biggest in Ukraine since the so-called Orange Revolution nine years ago, a populist movement that toppled the government. The battle over Ukraine: Toward a new geopolitical game . About 7,000 people were protesting in the capital, Kiev, as of Friday morning, police said. The crowds often swell in size in the evenings as people leave work and join the protest. While many have been demonstrating in Independence, or Maidan, Square, others have rallied outside the Cabinet Office, the presidential office and other government offices. Larger rallies are planned for the weekend. Chief among Yanukovich's reasons for backpedaling on the EU talks was Russia's opposition to it. Russia threatened its neighbor with trade sanctions and steep gas bills if it forged ahead with an EU deal but promised deep discounts on natural gas if it were to join the Moscow-led Customs Union instead. Yanukovich was also facing an EU demand that he was unwilling to meet: free Tymoshenko, his chief political opponent. The Orange Revolution that swept him from office in 2004, when he was prime minister, also swept Tymoshenko to power. Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison two years ago after being convicted of abuse of authority over a natural gas deal negotiated with Russia in 2009. The United States and Europe see the punishment as politically motivated. Yanukovich met his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Russia on Friday, against the backdrop of the anti-government protests. Putin and Yanukovich discussed the strategic partnership between the two countries, Yanukovich's office said. Yanukovich also canceled a planned trip to Malta -- a European Union member -- ""due to the necessity to focus attention on the internal political issues,"" his office said. Journalist Victoria Butenko reported from Kiev, and CNN's Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London. CNN's Marie-Louise Gumuchian contributed to this report.","Yulia Tymoshenko has ended a hunger strike, opposition party cites her daughter as saying .

"(CNN) -- Italy's coffee industry is being hit by the debt crisis as consumers stay home and tap quick-fix machines for their caffeine kick. Italians are increasingly buying their coffee on the shelves rather than ordering cappuccinos in the local cafes and bars, and the impact is reverberating through the industry. Budget blues . Mauricio Galindo, head of operations at the International Coffee Organization (ICO), told CNN family's budgets were being hit by the country's flailing economy. EXPLORE: How is your confidence in the euro? ""People don't drink as many coffees outside because they're more expensive, a little espresso is 2 euro, 2.50,"" he said. ""So they just buy to make it at home, and make it cheaper."" One of the country's most famous brands is feeling the squeeze as coffee-drinking habits change. Lavazza boss Antonio Baravalle told CNN that ""from a consumer point of view, we are facing a crisis in Italy because the market is losing 3% [to] 4%."" Italy has been one of the worst hit countries in the eurozone's financial crisis. The country has had eight consecutive quarters of economic contraction and unemployment is over 12%. Coffee consumption in Italy has dropped from 5.9kg in 2008, as the crisis kicked up, to 5.6kg per person last year, according to the ICO. READ MORE: Eurostar's pitch to open Europe . According to Galinda, people associate Italy with the espresso machine because it invented the style of coffee brewed under high pressure and with very hot temperatures. However, the Mediterranean country drinks less coffee than its reputation might suggest -- Finland consumption comes in at twice the level. The single shot . The arrival of the capsule-based Nespresso machine has attracted coffee-lovers through the U.S. and the UK, Galinda noted. This move toward single-serve devices could change consumption patterns in Europe, he added. ""As these machines become more popular, as they penetrate Germany and France, this could mean that people overall consume more coffee,"" he told CNN. WATCH: Film studio's challenges . For Baravalle, the shift creates an opportunity outside the company's home market. Lavazza currently holds 50% of the coffee market in Italy, the eurozone's third-largest economy, but is looking beyond those borders for its growth. ""We want to create USA as a second market for us... our objective is to become a credible alternative to Nespresso,"" he told CNN.","In 2012, consumers in Italy, Europe's second biggest importer of coffee, drank 5.6kg per person .

"Washington (CNN) -- Proving once again that any controversy will be intensified -- if not illuminated -- by random references to race, class, and gender, Education Secretary Arne Duncan has ignited a storm of protest by noting opposition from ""white suburban moms"" to one of his prized educational initiatives. In a meeting with state education chiefs Friday, Duncan said some opposition to the Common Core State Standards -- a controversial effort to standardize education -- has come from parents displeased that test results have exposed local weaknesses. Duncan said he found it ""fascinating"" that opponents include ""white suburban moms who -- all of a sudden -- (discovered that) their child isn't as bright as they thought they were, and their school isn't quite as good as they thought they were."" Duncan apologized for the remark Monday afternoon. Speaking to CNN, he said: ""My wording, my phrasing, was a little clumsy and I apologize for that."" Duncan said his point was that the goal is to prepare U.S. students for a ""globally competitive work force"" and to challenge education leaders to better explain to parents why higher standards are needed and what it takes to achieve them. ""I didn't say them perfectly, and I apologize for that,"" he added. ""My point is that children from every demographic across this country need a well-rounded, world-class education and frankly we have challenges not just in our inner cities but in our suburban areas, too, and we need to have honest conversations about that."" The ""white suburban moms"" remark was first reported Friday by Politico, which later reported that Duncan backpedaled, saying that he ""didn't say it perfectly."" The incident, if nothing else, is thrusting Common Core State Standards into red-hot glare of politically oriented social media. Duncan has pushed the initiative, which seeks to establish a single set of educational standards for kindergarten through high school for math and English. Advocates say the standards are essential to improve student skills, prepare them for college, and make the United States competitive with other nations. But opponents say the standards instill students with elitist values and rob communities of local control of schools. The remarks triggered a barrage of online comments, and a WhiteHouse.gov petition. As of noon Monday, 1,800 people had signed the petition to remove Duncan as secretary of education. A separate '""National Don't Send Your Child to School Day,"" protest over the standards has gained thousands of supporters on its Facebook page, though the number of children who were kept from school is unclear. Conservative commentator and Common Core foe Michelle Malkin scolded Duncan. ""Ohhhh yes, the red blood underneath my brown skin is boiling. This Obama educrat has stepped in it. Big time. Race card-wielding Education Secretary Arne Duncan is nothing but a corrupt and bankrupt bigot,"" Malkin wrote. Tweeted Randi Winegarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers: ""Arne-if u are reading- you shld walk this back..very insensitive-and not right-moms care abt their kids!! One Virginia-area mother posted a personal response on the left-leaning DailyKos arguing that Duncan missed the point. She said her own son was late to focus and achieve, and standardized testing would have marginalized him. ""I don't fight the Common Core because I think my child is brilliant, but because I'm tired of these one size fits all educational solutions,"" wrote Gretchen Moran Laskas. ""So yes, I'm opposed. Not because I don't understand it. Not because I think it will make my children look bad. But because I know that children already look bad -- and by the time they might get it together and look good the way (my son) could, it might be too late."" A Department of Education official said in an e-mail that, in making his remarks, Duncan was encouraging state education chiefs to better communicate why higher standards are so important. ""The far right and far left have made up their minds,"" spokesman Massie Ritsch wrote. ""But there's angst in the middle -- which includes many open-minded suburban parents -- that needs to be addressed."" ""Arne -- a white suburban dad married to a white suburban mom, with two kids in public schools -- has always been clear that test scores are an imperfect measure of student achievement and school quality, but tests are an indicator nonetheless,"" Ritsch wrote. ""And when that indicator conflicts with parents' notions of their child's abilities or their school's quality, it's understandable that some parents would be concerned."" The White House spokesman also defended Duncan, though Jay Carney said he had not seen all the comments. ""His point was that we need to be honest with kids and parents -- all can agree on that,"" Carney said on Monday.","NEW: In remarks to CNN, Duncan apologizes for his choice of words .

"(CNN) -- Over five years after Lucy Preciado was stabbed to death with a sword in front of her four children, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department has their primary suspect, Preciado's former boyfriend, in custody. Jesus Humberto Canales, an El Salvadoran national who goes by the nickname ""Chuey,"" is in the Los Angeles County Jail following his arrest in Mexico on Thursday, said Jeff Leslie, a sheriff's department homicide detective. Preciado, 26, was stabbed with a sword in her Lancaster, California, home on July 12, 2008. All of her children witnessed the stabbing. Her daughter, who was 9 years old at the time, called 911. In the days immediately following Preciado's killing, Canales fled to Pomona, California, before going to Las Cruces, New Mexico, Leslie said. He said the investigation led him to Las Cruces, where he missed Canales by a mere four hours; Canales had crossed the border into Mexico. In the years since, the case was featured at least twice on the television show ""America's Most Wanted,"" which led to hundreds of tips, Leslie said. Leslie said he and his partner, Detective Sgt. Kevin Lloyd, got a lead that seemed promising and were able to work with Mexican authorities, and also the U.S. Marshals Service, to locate Canales. Marshals arrested Canales Thursday in a small town outside of Jalisco, Mexico, Leslie said. He added that Canales had been living there with a woman and her four children since four days after Lucy Preciado was killed. Mexican authorities expelled Canales from that country and he was flown back to the United States, where LASD partners Leslie and Lloyd took custody of Canales at Los Angeles International Airport. ""After 5Â½ years it was a really satisfying feeling to put him into the back of a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department radio car,"" Leslie said. Canales was arrested on the warrant, issued six days after the killing, and is being held on one felony charge of murder and four felony charges of child endangerment. Bail for Canales has been set at $1.4 million. He is scheduled to be arraigned in L.A. County Court on Monday.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Britain's Prince Harry turned 25 Tuesday in the knowledge that he is now entitled to part of the multi-million dollar inheritance left to him by his late mother. Prince Harry is currently training to become a helicopter pilot with the British Army. Harry was just 12 years old when Diana, Princess of Wales, was killed in a car crash in Paris in 1997. His mother left an estate worth £21 million ($35 million), but more than £8 million ($13.31 million) was paid in inheritance tax, leaving around £13 million ($21.6 million) to be shared between Harry and his brother William, who is second in line to the throne, the British Press Association reported. Much of that money is thought to have been invested but it is not known if the economic downturn has affected the amount. Both princes are prevented from spending the lump sum of their inheritance until they turn 30. But Harry will pocket all income generated by his portion of the estate -- around £300,000 ($500,000) a year.  Watch more about Prince Harry's birthday windfall » . Prince Harry joined the British Army in 2006 and served in Afghanistan for more than two months from the end of 2007 to early 2008, before being withdrawn after news of his secret deployment leaked out to the media. There had been fears that Harry, who is third in line to the throne, could become a target for Taliban militants. According to British media reports, the prince's deployment was subject to a news blackout deal struck between the Ministry of Defence and newspapers and broadcasters in the UK and abroad. He received a promotion to the rank of lieutenant in April last year and is now training to become a helicopter pilot with the British Army's Air Corps. The young royal has also created a few negative headlines, particularly in Britain's tabloid press, in recent years. In February this year, he was formally disciplined by his Army superiors after videos surfaced showing him using offensive language -- referring to a fellow soldier as a ""Paki"" and another as looking ""like a raghead."" A spokesman for the prince told CNN: ""Prince Harry has apologized for his comments and has been subjected to normal Army disciplinary procedures. The matter is now closed."" In a well-publicized gaffe in 2005, Harry apologized after he was photographed wearing a Nazi uniform at a party. ""It was a very stupid thing to do and I've learned my lesson, simple as that really,"" he said in an interview marking his 21st birthday. ""I'd like to put it in the past now. What's done is done. I regret it.""","Harry was 12 when his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, was killed .

"London (CNN) -- Seven years after upsetting favorite Paris to win the right to host the 2012 Olympics, London is in the final straight of a long and often bumpy run-up to stage the sporting showpiece. As the city marks 100 days to go until the opening ceremony on Wednesday, venues are on schedule and within budget, tickets are selling out as quickly as they become available and sponsorship revenue has exceeded expectation. ""It's a big day for us, 100 days to go,"" said Sebastian Coe, the head of the London organizing committee. ""This is the moment when we really do start getting ready for celebrating and welcoming the world."" The UK capital will become the first city to host the Olympics three times in the modern era when the flame is lit on July 27. In 1948, when London last staged the Games in the wake of World War Two, no new venues were built and athletes were put up in army camps or colleges and even asked to bring their own towels. Although nowhere near the scale of those ""Austerity Games,"" London 2012 has faced its own challenges amid the global financial crisis which began after it won the bid in 2005. Still, an organizing committee led by two-time former Olympic champion Coe remains hopeful of delivering the games within the £9.3 billion ($14.8 billion) budget -- albeit a budget that more than doubled from an initial estimate of £4 billion ($6.5 billion). The permanent venues, including the £468 million ($746 million) Olympic Stadium, the Aquatics Center and the Velodrome, are complete, and test events are already under way. ""I think the one thing I'm confident in saying is that those things that are within our control are under control,"" Coe said. ""And we're in shape to deal with those things that inevitably come at you that you don't always see."" During the International Olympic Committee's final visit to London last month, president Jacques Rogge said: ""London has raised the bar on how to deliver a lasting legacy. We can already see tangible results in the remarkable regeneration of east London. This great historical city has created a legacy blueprint for future Games hosts."" The regeneration of a rundown area of east London was one of the cornerstones of the city's winning bid, yet its delivery hasn't been problem-free. As recently as last week, six protesters were evicted from a patch of parkland where a temporary basketball practice facility will be constructed. They claim the land has protected status and is for the enjoyment of all; Olympic organizers insist they will return the land to its original state once the Games are over. The athletes' village has been sold in a joint deal to the investment arm of the Qatari ruling family and a private British company, although 1,379 of the 2,818 homes will be set aside for affordable housing. A major question mark hangs over the future of the games' centerpiece: the Olympic Stadium. The process has been fraught with problems. Football club West Ham was originally awarded the venue, but that deal fell through after complaints from rival bidders. As it stands, West Ham remains one of four parties interested in becoming tenants from 2014. A decision is expected next month. Transport and security concerns . The most immediate concerns for London surround transport and security. Ask any Londoner the worst thing about their city and they will almost certainly reply: getting around. The city's aging subway system already barely copes with the daily demand. During the Olympics, an additional 325,000 people are expected in the city each day. Add in the regular strikes by underground workers that cripple the network -- another of which was called on Monday -- and the potential for chaos only increases. London businesses are being advised to encourage staff to work from home if possible, change their working hours, or use different travel routes. Athletes, officials and VIPs shouldn't be affected. They will have access to special road lanes to get them to the venues with the minimum of fuss. That plan hasn't met with universal approval though, with critics insisting it will leave the rest of the roads gridlocked. Security issues were brought into sharp focus by an incident at the recent Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race when a protester managed to swim across the River Thames and bring a temporary halt to one of the Britain's oldest sporting events. Last year's riots are also still fresh in the memory. While preventing every breach may be impossible, London has a security budget of £553 million ($881 million) dedicated to minimize the risks, which includes the deployment of 35,000 security guards and police at the games venues. There are, however, concerns that budget could increase. Protest fears . Even before the Games begin, there are fears that the 70-day torch relay beginning May 19 could be targeted by protesters. A group known as ""Greenwash Gold 2012"" this week unveiled plans to target three major Olympic sponsors -- Dow Chemical, BP and Rio Tinto -- who the activists accuse of human rights or environmental abuses. The group is led by Meredith Alexander, who resigned from the London 2012 sustainability watchdog after Dow, which has links to a deadly gas leak at the Bhopal plant in India in 1984, was announced as sponsor of the proposed ""wrap"" around the Olympic Stadium. ""We live in a democracy but we always balance protest with the rights of other people as well,"" Coe said Tuesday. ""We have to remember that one man's protest is the destruction of somebody else's dream. I'm sure we will get this in balance."" But the start of the torch relay is also expected to finally spark enthusiasm among a characteristically cynical British public. A recent survey by a foreign exchange company suggested a quarter of those Britons traveling abroad this summer are doing so specifically to avoid the Olympics. As they leave, more than 10,000 athletes from 204 countries will arrive, and the tantalizing prospect of international stars such as Usain Bolt and Michael Phelps competing alongside British hopes like Jessica Ennis and Mo Farah should go some way to appeasing those Britons who choose to stay behind. ""There is an unprecedented appetite among elite-level competitors around the world to get to London, that's the one thing I've learned,"" Coe said. ""On top of domestic engagement, I don't think any Games has ever had that level of excitement.""","Wednesday marks 100 days to go until the opening ceremony of the London Olympics .

"(EW.com) -- If you love the films of Joel and Ethan Coen, you know that they always look at the world through jaundiced, snark-colored glasses; they'll never be warm and toasty. That quality of metaphysical cynicism runs through all my favorite Coen brothers films, from ""Fargo"" to ""Burn After Reading"" to ""A Serious Man."" But I was still taken aback to see their jokey misanthropy applied to ""Inside Llewyn Davis,"" a tale set in the achingly sincere Greenwich Village folk-music scene of 1961. Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac) is a musician who's the definition of ''struggling.'' He's a talented scrounger, crashing on his friends' couches and living off the pass-around basket after gigs. Really, he's a step away from dereliction. 'Inside Llewyn Davis': Oscar Isaac, Marcus Mumford, and the Punch Brothers perform a song from the film . The film opens with Llewyn performing a song at the Gaslight Cafe, and he's a terrific singer — direct, emotional, and pure. Isaac, the Guatemalan-born actor and musician who plays him, has hooded dark eyes set off here by a thick beard and unruly black hair (he's like Lenny Bruce as a hipster rabbinical student). He gives Llewyn an earnest, dweeby-sexy Everyman solidity. But ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" is about how life has played a cosmic joke on Llewyn. The quiet, humble folk scene, though no one really knows it yet, is fading; it's about to be washed over by the tidal wave of Dylan, and by the pop commercialization represented by Peter, Paul and Mary. Prize Fighter: Best Actor shapes up as the Oscars' toughest race . Llewyn is friendly with a musician couple, Jim (Justin Timberlake) and Jean (Carey Mulligan), who is pregnant — possibly by Llewyn, whom she despises. When Jim and Jean get up on stage to perform ''500 Miles,'' we're meant to see that the song, in its lilting loveliness, spells the end for singers like Llewyn. He was once part of a duo himself, but his singing partner killed himself by jumping off the George Washington Bridge, and Llewyn, having gone solo, is now a desperate jerk who treats people like crap because he's hurting deep down inside. The Coens bring the pre-Dylan 1960s Village to life with a spangly authenticity that leaps off the screen. There's now a ""Mad Men"" fascination to this era, and the Coens capture how the wintry streets and scuzzy apartments — the peeling-paint rooms and comically narrow hallways — were romantic in their very discomfort. You had to want to be in the Village, playing folk songs for peanuts (sometimes literally). And Llewyn Davis, though not a nice guy, has that spirit. Top 10 Movies of '13: Chris Nashawaty Picks... The film charts his downward spiral, and for a while I wondered: Why introduce a hero with talent only to mock his dreams? Yet the more I watched ""Inside Llewyn Davis,"" the more I saw that there is something indelible in the Coens' vision of a morosely gifted loser slipping through the cracks. When Llewyn goes into the studio to help record a satirical novelty song called ''Please Mr. Kennedy,'' the movie seems to have the makings of an ebullient folk musical. But the Coens are way too sardonic for that. With ""Inside Llewyn Davis,"" they've made a film that is almost spooky in its perversity: a lovingly lived-in, detailed tribute to the folk scene that — hauntingly — has shut their hero out.

"(CNN) -- The USS George Washington is expected to leave the Philippines once two amphibious ships arrive there Wednesday, Navy officials say. The USS Ashland and the USS Germantown can get closer to the storm-ravaged areas than the massive aircraft carrier, and they have a variety of helicopters, small boats, trucks, equipment to produce potable water and other supplies needed in the relief effort. ""They are the Swiss army knife of the U.S. military,"" Marine Corps Brig. Gen. Paul Kennedy, who is in charge of the U.S. military relief efforts, told CNN last week after he requested the ships from the Pentagon. The two ships picked up 900 Marines in Okinawa to aid in the relief efforts. A third ship, the USS Freedom, is also carrying supplies from Singapore, the Navy said. The George Washington was one of the first in the U.S. fleet to bring large-scale help to Filipinos after Typhoon Haiyan left death, destruction and hundreds of thousands of survivors without food and water.","U.S. Navy says two amphibious ships are to arrive Wednesday in the Philippines .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan would be funded into early 2009 under a compromise plan approved Thursday by the U.S. House. The bill includes $165 billion to fund the wars in Afghanistan, above, and Iraq. The $165 billion measure puts no restrictions on money the Bush administration had requested to continue bankrolling the wars but includes money for key domestic priorities for House Democrats, namely more unemployment assistance for people who lose their jobs and an expansion of the G.I. Bill. The plan also includes more than $2 billion for disaster assistance for areas in the Midwest dealing with massive flooding. A first vote, on the war funding, was approved 268-155. A second vote on the domestic money passed 416-12. President Bush and many congressional Republicans had resisted extending unemployment benefits, but the compromise bill includes another 13 weeks of assistance. Democrats had been pushing for extending benefits to laid-off workers as unemployment rates continue to rise. Democrats also got Republican support for a college scholarships program for U.S. troops, known as a ""new G.I. bill."" This program expands educational benefits for veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan to pay for full four-year scholarships. House Democratic and Republican leaders reached an agreement on the plan Wednesday, and Bush administration officials said they were satisfied with the compromise. Anti-war protesters in the House gallery shouted and chanted briefly during the vote, tossing what appeared to be slips of paper onto the House floor. They were removed from the gallery without incident. The two bills approved Thursday will be combined and sent to the Senate for approval as one measure.","$165 billion measure puts no restrictions on war-money Bush requested .

"Havana (CNN) -- Young and old burn up the dance floor at Havana's Las Canitas nightclub every weekend. On a recent Saturday night, half of the dancers twirling to the latest salsa hits were from Switzerland. Cubans pride themselves on their intricate, hip-swiveling moves and can usually tell the difference between locals and foreigners. ""See, look at him. He needs to move his hips more,"" a young Cuban woman shouted over the blaring sound system as she watched the Swiss tourists. But some of them surprised her. ""Wow, he's got tremendous feeling,"" she said pointing to another dancer as he spun his partner in circles. ""He could definitely be Cuban."" This Caribbean island may be best known among tourists for its pristine beaches and classic American cars, but travelers are increasingly headed to Cuba for salsa dancing. The tropical music has taken Europe and Asia by storm, with salsa clubs and dance studios in high demand, especially in the UK, Germany and Japan. And when it comes time to travel, they've still got salsa on the mind. Cuban dance instructor Marisuri Garcia opened a dance school in Switzerland, where she lives part of the year. Back in Cuba, she receives locals and tourists in her second-story apartment on a rundown street in the center of Havana. Many Cubans like her have bought licenses from the government, which allow them to offer private lessons, charging around $5 per hour. ""Dancing helps you live better,"" she told CNN. ""It helps you to look inside and open up, to be free in mind and body."" Cuba's Culture Ministry also offers salsa packages with state-run dance studios like SprachCaffe, where tourists are paired with individual instructors. A two-week tour including dance classes, hotel and some meals runs about 900 euros, or about $1,300. Garcia has converted her terrace into a studio with a green plastic roof, mirrors on the walls and views of her neighbors' laundry drying in the sun. ""More sexy!"" she shouts to the rows of Swiss visitors as they roll their hips and practice their steps. This group has come on a two-week package that includes beach time and city tours. But their main goal is to go home dancing better than when they arrived. ""I have been dancing for three or four years,"" said Peter Schaffer, an accountant. ""Now I will find my individual style."" The origins of salsa are disputed. It has its roots in Cuba's son and mambo but was heavily influenced by American music and Latin Americans living in New York. Evelyn Hiestand, a flight attendant, says she has been dancing salsa for years but feels that she has found something more genuine in Cuba. ""Because I think it's the roots of salsa,"" she said. ""It's joy. It's joy of life."" Because of U.S. travel restrictions, very few American tourists make it to Cuba. Cuba: Easing of U.S. travel restrictions doesn't go far enough . Garcia thinks salsa dancing could be a bridge as more cultural exchanges are allowed by President Barack Obama's administration. She hopes to help people overcome political differences on the dance floor. ""We've got Swiss and Germans dancing salsa like Cubans,"" she says. ""It's time to see more Americans!""","Many European and Asian visitors are traveling to Cuba to improve their salsa technique .

"(CNN) -- A man with a knife hijacked a school bus in central Arkansas on Thursday morning, taking 11 elementary school students and their driver on a detour that police ended after a roughly 10-mile chase, authorities said. Nicholas John Miller, 22, was arrested after the incident, which began in Jacksonville -- about 12 miles northeast of Little Rock -- and ended in nearby Cabot, Jacksonville Police Capt. Kenny Boyd said. No one -- including the 11 students of Pinewood Elementary School in Jacksonville and the bus driver -- was injured, Boyd said. The incident began with Miller allegedly demanding a car from a woman in Jacksonville, Boyd said. But she ""did not have one to give,"" Jacksonville police added in a news release. The bus had stopped nearby, and Miller left the woman, boarded the bus and, armed with the knife, took over the driver's seat, Jacksonville police said. The woman called police, who eventually found the bus and pursued it north to Cabot. A cell phone video of the chase, recorded by 17-year-old onlooker Kelsey Eggers and provided to CNN, shows a bus moving along a two-lane road pursued by 10 police cars with flashing lights. Police stopped the bus roughly 20 minutes after the hijacking began, according to Boyd. ""We were able to get the bus stopped. The suspect was taken into custody, and nobody was injured,"" he said. According to an arrest report, Miller told authorities that people were after him and that he needed to take the bus to save his life. He said he had no plans to hurt any of the children or the driver. An office worker who answered the phone at the school Thursday morning said parents were being notified. Miller was being charged Thursday with a felony count of vehicle piracy, 12 felony counts of kidnapping, and two felony counts of aggravated assault, Jacksonville police spokeswoman April Kiser said. The incident was not his first brush with the law this year. In May, according to a police report, Miller was arrested on suspicion of breaking and entering a vehicle, and stealing a shotgun and money. He was sentenced in September to 24 months of probation. Miller's grandmother, Elsie Miller, said she didn't know why he would have hijacked a bus, and she hadn't had a chance to speak with him since his arrest Thursday. She said her grandson lives in Jacksonville. ""He has a good heart. I am totally surprised,"" she said. Boy kidnapped from school bus held in underground bunker .

"London (CNN) -- Celebrity chef Nigella Lawson used cocaine during two periods of her life, she admitted Wednesday as she testified in the fraud trial of two former personal assistants in a London court. She told the court she had used the drug about six times with her late husband, John Diamond, when he learned that his cancer was terminal, in order to give him ""some escape from his treatment."" She also used cocaine once in July 2010 when she felt subject to ""terrorism"" by her then-husband Charles Saatchi, she said. At that point she felt trapped, isolated and unhappy, she said, and a friend offered her the drug. But, Lawson said, ""I've never been a drug addict, I've never been an habitual user. ... I did not have a drug problem, I had a life problem."" Saatchi had claimed in an e-mail that Lawson had used drugs regularly, but in testimony Friday he backed off that claim. Lawson's admission of cocaine use came after she earlier testified that Saatchi had threatened to ""destroy"" her if she did not ""clear his name."" She had been asked about her reluctance to attend court as a witness in the assistants' trial -- a case that has gripped the media as claims emerge about the couple's troubled personal life. ""I have been put on trial here where I am called to answer, and glad to answer the allegations, and the world's press, and it comes after a long summer of bullying and abuse,"" Lawson said. ""I find it's another chapter in that."" Referring to Saatchi's request for her to attend the trial, made in a letter sent by his lawyers, Lawson said: ""He had said to me if I didn't get back to him and clear his name he would destroy me."" Lawson said she felt she had to do her civic duty. ""It's difficult for me, it's very difficult for my children, but I want to do the right thing,"" she added. The former aides, Italian sisters Francesca and Elisabetta Grillo, deny embezzling hundreds of thousands of pounds on company credit cards while employed by Lawson and Saatchi. 'No hard evidence' In his testimony last Friday, Saatchi addressed the claim made in an e-mail he sent to Lawson in October that alleged she had used drugs. He told the court he never saw his wife taking drugs during their 10-year marriage and he had no hard evidence she had done so. He also said he was ""utterly heartbroken"" by the end of their relationship. In the e-mail, which was shared with the court by the defense in a pretrial hearing, Saatchi wrote that the assistants would likely ""get off"" because Lawson was using cocaine and marijuana on a daily basis and ""allowed the sisters to spend whatever they liked."" The allegations emerged in June, around the time the couple were photographed in a restaurant having an argument. In the photos, which were splashed across the front pages of national newspapers, Saatchi is seen with his hand around Lawson's throat. Saatchi accepted a police caution for assault, and the couple announced they would divorce soon afterward. 'She was a rock' The two defendants, who worked for Lawson and Saatchi for a number of years, were supposed to use the cards for household expenses, but allegedly spent large amounts on themselves. Lawson acknowledged Wednesday she wasn't familiar with every detail of the purchases made by the Grillo sisters. She told the court she had employed Elisabetta, also known as Lisa, while her ex-husband had hired Francesca. ""I loved Lisa. She came to me in a difficult time in my life. She was a rock,"" Lawson said. She said Elisabetta Grillo had left her job for a while, and when she came back she'd been increasingly bitter and unhappy. ""I do not think her bitterness was towards me personally. I think it was towards her life,"" the chef said. Lawson ignored the crowd of reporters and photographers waiting outside Isleworth Crown Court as she entered earlier, wearing black and looking somber. Transactions top $1 million . Saatchi's accountant gave details of the sisters' alleged spending on luxury goods in court last week, including purchases from Prada, Miu Miu and Louis Vuitton. The prosecution also showed Saatchi a list of the top 50 transactions made by the sisters, totaling more than $1 million, which he said he did not recognize and had not authorized. He did not know whether Lawson had approved them, he said. Lawson, whose culinary skills and flirtatious manner have long entranced UK audiences, has also appeared as a judge on ABC show ""The Taste"" in the United States. A second season of the show is due to air in January.","""I did not have a drug problem, I had a life problem,"" says Nigella Lawson .

"(CNN) -- Officials at Princeton University were to meet over the weekend to decide whether to offer students a vaccine against meningitis after seven cases of the potentially fatal disease occurred on campus. ""We will be discussing it with our trustees this weekend,"" school spokesman Martin Mbugua said Friday. The world's sole meningococcal vaccine that targets meningitis group B is called Bexsero and is manufactured by Novartis. Though it is approved in Europe and Australia, it has not been approved for use in the United States. ""We have filed an Investigational New Drug application for our MenB vaccine in the U.S., but have not yet come to an agreement on a pathway to licensure for this vaccine with regulatory authorities,"" Novartis spokeswoman Elizabeth Power told CNN Saturday in an e-mail. Still, company officials have been coordinating with officials at Princeton, the Centers for Disease Control and the state Department of Public Health about getting a vaccine to the school, she said. ""We took the step to allow the option to vaccinate the students, but the decision to do so has not been made yet,"" CDC spokeswoman Barbara Reynolds told CNN on Friday. Group B meningitis is a strain of the bacterial form of the disease that is rare in the United States. Symptoms can include stiff neck, headache, fever, vomiting, rashes, sensitivity to light and confusion. Untreated, the disease can lead to complications such as hearing impairment, brain damage, limb amputations and death. It is treated with antibiotics. What is meningitis? ""Usually, when you see this kind of meningitis on the campus, it's meningitis C,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University, in a telephone interview with CNN. ""This is very, very unusual."" Schaffner added that, in the United States, Group B meningitis typically strikes infants, and only rarely adolescents and young adults. Though the mechanism needed for health officials to administer an unapproved vaccine in the United States is ""very elaborate,"" it would be justified in this case, he said. ""If I were around the table with the board of trustees, I would be gently encouraging them to do this."" Princeton's first reported case developed in a student who had returned to the campus after spring recess in March, according to the state health department. Two months later, after six students and one visitor had contracted the disease, an outbreak was declared. All have recovered except for the last case, a male student who remains hospitalized after being diagnosed on November 8. No common link has been identified among the cases, New Jersey health officials said. CDC: Bacterial meningitis explainer . Meningitis can spread via the exchange of saliva and other respiratory secretions through kissing, coughing, sharing drinks and living in close quarters, such as in dormitories, according to the health department. The bacteria can reside for months in the back of the throat before causing symptoms, Schaffner said. But the disease is not wholly understood. Cases of meningococcal disease in general -- including Group B -- have dropped in recent years to the lowest levels since the 1930s. ""Nobody knows why,"" he said. And cases sometimes occur more frequently in Oregon. ""We've never understood that either."" The New Jersey outbreak is also puzzling. ""Why this is occurring is not clear, but the trick everybody is working on is how to stop it, how to prevent further cases,"" he said. If the board decides to offer the vaccine, as many as 8,000 undergraduate and graduate students at the school could be offered the vaccine. Meningitis vaccines urged before NYC Pride events .

"(CNN) -- In the latest blow to militants, the French military said Wednesday it has seized the airport in Kidal, the last major town under rebel control in northern Mali. If the forces secure the town, it will be the last major city in their sweep north to flush out Islamist militants in Mali, France's former colony. Read more: Why Mali matters? France sent its troops at Mali's request after the Islamists seized the strategic town of Konna on January 10. The town is back under Malian control. In addition, French-led troops now control Timbuktu and Gao cities, and the swath in between that was an Islamist stronghold for almost a year, the French Defense Ministry said this week. CNN iReport: Timbuktu on my mind . Life trickled back to normal in Timbuktu, the ancient desert city and home to world-famous cultural sites. ""We are winning in Mali,"" French President Francois Hollande said Monday. France, which is leading the offensive, has 2,150 soldiers in Mali and 1,000 more troops supporting the operation from elsewhere. The United States has also stepped up its involvement in the conflict by conducting aerial refueling missions on top of the intelligence and airlift support. What's behind the instability in Mali? The United Kingdom said it is prepared to provide 240 troops to provide military training support, but will not take part in combat. Up to 40 of those troops will be deployed to a European Union military training mission in Mali and the rest in English-speaking West African countries. The nations are teaming up to prevent the Islamists from turning the once peaceful democracy into a haven for international terrorists. As nations pledge more help, additional funds streamed in as well. Among the donors, Japan pledged $120 million, the United States $96 million pending congressional approval and the European Union just over $67 million. Read more: U.S. steps up involvement in Mali . Senegal, Nigeria and Ghana pledged $3 million each, and China and India pledged $1 million each. Islamic extremists carved out a large portion in northern Mali last year, taking advantage of a chaotic situation after a military coup. They banned music, smoking, drinking and watching sports on television, and destroyed historic tombs and shrines in the region. More than 380,000 people fled northern Mali in the past year, the United Nations says. But with the French-led offensive sending the militants on the run, residents once again roamed the streets without fear. Villagers chanted ""Mali!

"(CNN) -- The United States and Israel are ""absolutely in sync"" about the need to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, Secretary of State John Kerry said Friday. Talk of Iran's nuclear program took center stage in close to nine hours of talks Thursday and Friday between Kerry and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Kerry met with Netanyahu for the first time since the U.S. and five other world powers reached a deal with Iran over its nuclear program. His talks aimed to convince the Israeli leader to move beyond the ""first step"" deal and work on a comprehensive agreement that addresses all of Israel's concerns about Iran's program. Once just speculation, differences between the U.S. and Israel on how to deal with Iran's nuclear program have spilled into an open rift between the two allies. Netanyahu has accused international powers that reached a deal with Iran to curb its nuclear program of making a ""historic mistake"" that could put Israel in grave danger. The agreement calls for the easing of economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for increased inspections and limits on the country's uranium enrichment program, which many international analysts fear is meant for military purposes. The Israeli leader wants to eliminate Iran's capability entirely, rather than merely suspend Tehran's nuclear development. He is adamantly opposed to any enrichment on Iranian soil, but this week Wendy Sherman, the lead U.S. negotiator for the Iran talks, said Washington would be willing to consider a limited, closely monitored Iranian enrichment program. ""The Prime Minister has every right in the world to make his views known with respect to his concerns about the security of his country,"" Kerry said upon leaving Israel, but he added that Netanyahu ""has been extremely constructive on the next steps and where we need to go now."" ""He knows that we are now in the real negotiation,"" Kerry said of Netanyahu. He noted that the interim deal freezes the Iranian enrichment program, while a comprehensive agreement is negotiated, and it expands the amount of time by which Iran could develop a breakout capacity. ""I am personally convinced without any reasonable doubt that Israel is safer today,"" as a result of the interim agreement, he said. In public remarks after his private meeting with Netanyahu, Kerry said the United States remains committed to Israel's security. ""I can't emphasize enough that Israel's security in this negotiation is at the top of our agenda,"" Kerry said. ""And the United States will do everything in our power to make certain that Iran's nuclear program -- a program of weaponization possibilities -- is terminated. World powers have imposed a six-month deadline for a final deal. ""We agree on what the goal of the final status agreement ought to be,"" Kerry said. ""And in the days and weeks ahead, we will consult very closely and continually with our Israeli friends in order to bring about a comprehensive agreement that can withstand everybody's test."" Israeli-Palestinian peace . This marked Kerry's eighth trip to the region, making yet another push for a peace deal between Israelis and Palestinians. After his talks with Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, Kerry said the leaders remain ""as determined as ever"" to negotiate a peace deal. He said he believed the parties were ""closer than ever"" to realizing a two-state solution. Kerry said the perseverance of former South African President Nelson Mandela's fight for equality and justice should be a model to skeptics of the prospects for peace. ""The naysayers are wrong to call peace in this region an impossible goal. It always seems impossible until it is done,"" he said. He kicked off talks in July, but in November, both sides dug into their decades-old trenches and passed around blame. Israelis and Palestinians are four months into a nine-month deadline given to them by Kerry to reach a peace deal, with little visible progress. With direct negotiations between the two sides flailing, the United States seems to have moved into a more muscular role as mediator by presenting its own bridging proposals to the parties instead of relying on the Israelis and Palestinians to negotiate among themselves, which has born little fruit. On Thursday, U.S. Gen. John Allen presented Netanyahu with a detailed plan to address Israel's security needs in the event of a comprehensive peace agreement. ""Neither peace nor prosperity is possible without security,"" he said, adding that the U.S. will ""only support a final status agreement that makes both Israel and the Palestinians safer than they are today."" On Thursday, Netanyahu said that Israel is ""ready for a historic peace"" based on a two-state solution but that his country's security needs must be respected. He said finger-pointing that helped derail the earlier talks must end. Security is a must if Israel is going to sign on, Netanyahu said. ""Israel must be able to defend itself by itself."" He appeared to be referring to the Jordan Valley, where Israel has insisted its own troops must remain, as opposed to the international troops that patrol the tense borders with Syria and Lebanon. Palestinians have rejected, out of hand, Israeli soldiers within the borders of their own states. By echoing Netanyahu's language that a peace deal must recognize Israel as ""a country that can defend itself by itself,"" Kerry appeared to be siding with Israel. ""What we need is not grandstanding but understanding,"" he said. Palestinians have argued that Israel has been sowing distrust by continuing the construction of thousands of Jewish settlement units on the West Bank and other land that Palestinians claim as theirs. It is the real source of the ""deep crisis between the Palestinians and the Israeli negotiations team,"" a Palestinian official said. CNN's Michael Pearson and Ben Brumfield contributed to this report.","U.S. secretary of state, Israeli Prime Minister were in talks for nearly nine hours today .

"(CNN) -- Every year on World AIDS Day, old-timers like me are trotted out to say a few words to well-motivated audiences, while over the years, the over-riding themes become more empty and banal. The international theme for World AIDS Day from 2011 to 2015 is ""Getting to zero,"" which UNAIDS defines as zero new HIV infections, zero discrimination and zero AIDS-related deaths. This strikes me as frankly preposterous for the simple reason that such a goal remains so patently unachievable. Of course World AIDS Day provides a welcome opportunity for AIDS charities and others to discuss the latest statistics in public, but one cannot escape the feeling that it all amounts to little more than a convenient excuse for government departments to shrug off the whole issue. On December 2 the whole subject may be conveniently forgotten for another 12 months. The availability of effective treatment drugs from 1996 onwards had an immediate impact on mortality rates throughout the developed world and beyond, with the result that few people under 30 have experienced multiple loss on anything remotely like the same scale as previous generations. Yet today far more gay men of all age groups in many countries including Britain are now living with HIV than ever before. Overall rates of new infections remain high. In the UK, 6,364 new cases were reported last year, compared to 2,938 in 1998. And reported infections among gay men in the UK reached an all-time high. Unsurprisingly perhaps, the young are disproportionately affected, not because they have some of death wish, but for the simple reason that they were not born when my generation began setting up the first AIDS-related charities and self-help groups and grass-roots education campaigns, and many have had no access whatever to targeted HIV education. Many older gay men like me are cautious about sounding like AIDS bores, and often feel obliged to censor what we say about our own experience and emotions. So ironically, younger gay men hear little or nothing about the complex realities of the epidemic, or its history, from which many feel emotionally distanced. Taboo subject . If anything the subject is more taboo than ever. This is why it makes me furious whenever I hear the word apathy used of young gay men in relation to HIV, as if they had some kind of magical access to helpful, reliable advice and information, when nothing could be further from the truth. In the 21st century, HIV has largely disappeared into its own particular closet, for understandable reasons. Who after all would choose to be primarily defined in public by a medical diagnosis of any kind? This has however had the consequence of hiding the epidemic in our midst. The triumphalist rhetoric surrounding the whole issue of treatment these days can alas all too easily serve to undermine prevention work. Messages intended to reassure the newly-infected may be taken by the uninfected as an invitation to minimize the significance of contracting HIV in the first place, or for that matter of infecting others, and only serve to establish the general impression that HIV is in fact no big deal. Just what is so bad then about becoming HIV positive in 2013? What is not initially apparent to many is the fact that while it is easy to get infected, this cannot be reversed. Nothing is said about the fact that following diagnosis there stretches a lifetime relationship to doctors and the world of specialist clinics and primary care. Nothing is said about the need for regular monitoring, and regular compliance with your medication. Most of us come to take this in our stride, but it none the less tethers one daily to the fact of infection and the associations of mortality with which it is inevitably associated. Widespread stigma . Nothing prepares you for the sensation that is very like extreme jet-lag which sets in within an hour or so of taking standard daily anti-HIV medication. Nothing prepares you for waking screaming most nights from hideous chemically-induced nightmares. Nothing is said about the widespread stigma experienced by most HIV+ gay men, not least from our frequently ignorant and prejudiced gay peers. And nothing whatsoever is said about the fact that if you stop taking your drugs you are highly likely to die a very unpleasant death. All of us involved in the long-term community-based response to HIV have long understood that it is both pointless and dishonest to try to scare people into behavior change by pretending that HIV is still an automatic death sentence. It remains, however, a life sentence, and one which over time is likely to profoundly affect one's relationships with other people, from friends and lovers to family members, and it strikes me as misguided folly not to make it very clear to everyone that HIV remains a potentially life-threatening and incurable disease. In relation to HIV I think we can identify two relatively distinct sets of pressing contemporary issues. One concerns the long-term psychological impact for older gay men of living through a disaster of such duration, which is still so easily forgotten by everyone around us. The other concerns the need for targeted support and education for African residents in the UK and gay men, especially relating to the advantages of regular HIV testing which should be understood as a fundamental aspect of self-care. The issues are complicated by the fact that so many gay men grow up with a radically impaired sense of self worth, and there has long been a yawning gulf between excessive attention to physical fitness and appearances, and neglect of our inner emotional well-being. Slow-motion catastrophe . In these circumstances the A-word that interests me is not apathy, imagined as a form of culpable voluntary moral failing, but alliances, above all between different generations of gay men who share such closely parallel contemporary challenges. All too often such vast global problems as global warming or the crisis of the banking system end up merely sapping our energy since it seems so hard for individuals to feel that we can make any measurable improvements. Yet this is not the case in relation to HIV, where there are clear practical targets which could be achieved with sufficient collective determination. This is not a vague general question of ""Getting to zero"" as UNAIDS so unhelpfully frames it, but by contrast of working towards specific achievable local goals. The early fight against AIDS was fought and largely won above all as a cultural achievement on the part of often small grass-roots organizations rooted in traditions of self-help. This is precisely why campaigns to normalize testing are so important, alongside the clear medical advantages of knowing one's own HIV status. It is fashionable in some quarters to attack condom education, but it cannot be sufficiently emphasized that most gay men have got through the epidemic without getting infected because they have indeed been diligent in their use. This is not necessarily always as easy as it may sound. But whatever else may be in the pipeline by way of chemical prophylaxis, it remains every bit as important today as it was 30 years ago when the idea and practice of safer sex was first invented in New York, that any gay man getting fucked who is not 100% confident about his partner's HIV status should insist on their using a condom. If the rates of new infections among gay men were occurring within any other population group, I think there would be riots on the streets. Almost 30 years ago, in my first book on AIDS, I wrote that until gay men are provided with adequate resources to fight this ongoing slow-motion catastrophe in our midst, ""it will be difficult not to conclude that we are regarded in our entirety as a disposable population."" Yes, much has changed, especially in the West, but sadly in many parts of the world that day has evidently yet to dawn. The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of Simon Watney.","World AIDS Day theme ""getting to zero"" is a goal that remains patently unachievable, Watney says .

"(CNN) -- You would think that a black man born and raised in Georgia, who was a teenager during the civil rights movement, would understand the transition of African-Americans from voting overwhelmingly Republican to strongly supporting the Democratic Party. But the GOP presidential candidate clearly didn't have the common sense that he often speaks of having when he went on CNN's ""The Situation Room"" and accused many African-Americans of being brainwashed to vote Democratic. ""Many African-Americans have been brainwashed into not being open-minded, not even considering a conservative point of view,"" Cain said. ""I have received some of that same vitriol simply because I am running for the Republican nomination as a conservative. ""So it's just brainwashing and people not being open-minded, pure and simple."" Cain's off-base and historically ignorant comments have received widespread coverage. In some quarters, they have been criticized, while MSNBC's Pat Buchanan, who has a long history of racially offensive comments, didn't surprise many by coming to Cain's defense. It's not the first time I've heard someone question the reasons for blacks' allegiance to the Democratic Party, but history has to be taken into account. According to the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a think tank focused on African-American issues, in the aftermath of the Emancipation Proclamation, black folks who could vote in the United States quickly joined the Republican Party out of affection for President Abraham Lincoln. Check the political party affiliation of blacks elected during the period of Reconstruction and you will see a lot of R's after their names. The policies of Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry Truman, who desegregated the military, led more African-Americans to vote for the Democrats. Still, Dwight Eisenhower got 39 percent of the black vote when he ran for re-election in 1956; and Vice President Richard Nixon received 31 percent against the eventual winner, Sen. John F. Kennedy. The shift became more noticeable in 1964, when the Republican Party nominated Sen. Barry Goldwater as its presidential nominee. It was Goldwater's ardent stance against the Civil Rights Act that led President Lyndon Johnson to garner 94 percent of the black vote. What's interesting to note is the greatest threat to passage of the bill came from white Southern Democrats, known as Dixiecrats. Moderate Republicans played a crucial role in getting the Civil Rights Act passed, yet as the GOP began to go against civil rights, the national Democratic Party saw a chance to solidify the black vote. In 1968, Nixon returned to the national stage with his Southern Strategy, a detailed plan of racial politics that ignored, denigrated and dismissed black voters while playing up racial issues as a way to gain support from white voters. All of this was an outgrowth of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which led President Johnson to say his signing of the law would deliver the South to the GOP for the next generation. The Southern Strategy became the go-to play for Republicans over the next 40 years, as they virtually ignored the interests of black voters and catered to a largely white party. So on one hand you have a party that totally ignores black voters -- the GOP -- and then you have Democrats who see a chance to capture those same voters. If Republicans today are angry about a high level of animosity coming from black voters, they need to blame their white forefathers who wanted to see the racial divide continue over their refusal to allow African-Americans to be full citizens of the United States. The problem is that the GOP has done little to change the game since then, virtually ignoring African-Americans and advocating policies that blacks believe go against their interests. What is so shameful and asinine about Cain's ""brainwashing "" comment is that he assumes that African-Americans aren't smart and sophisticated enough to make their own choices. Just like whites, Asians, Hispanics, women, Catholics, Jews, Baptists, Wall Street bankers, or any other voting group, they look at the candidates, determine how they line up with their views, and make a selection. So when someone says that blacks don't vote with their brains, that's utterly false. Now, for all of the trolls who usually populate web sites comments sections saying I'm playing the race card, answer this: If I said that Southern whites were a bunch of brainwashed, dead heads who give the GOP their vote, how would you respond? U.S. Census Bureau statistics show that of the 10 poorest states in America, nine are mostly red states. The lowest when it comes to education? Mostly red states. The most obese? Worst health care? Mostly red states. So if the talking points suggest the Democrats advance poverty programs more than the GOP; push for more funding for education; and want a strong health care program, then why are these white voters in these mostly red states voting for the GOP? Have they been brainwashed by virtue of the Southern Strategy to keep voting straight ticket? The GOP has no real plan to even talk to black voters. They are afraid of them. Yes, afraid. If you want to put a Republican in the most uncomfortable position, then see them try to give a speech in front of a room of black folks. There is mistrust on both sides rather than straight talk on the issues. For years I have lamented the GOP's refusal to engage African-Americans. We care about housing, economic development, education, any host of issues. But in the minds of a lot of Republicans, it's all about welfare or affirmative action. African-Americans are largely social conservatives, but the GOP can't even figure out how to reach us even with God! I'm the host of Washington Watch, a weekly Sunday morning news show on TV One Cable Network, a lifestyles and entertainment network targeting African-Americans, and the GOP flat out refuses to even accept our invitations. For two years we've had an open invite for any House or Senate Republican to come on our show, no matter the week. Out of 80-plus shows, Rep. Tom Price of Georgia (twice) and Rep. Allen West of Florida (once) have accepted our invitations. West sat in my studio and told his press secretary to send an e-mail to every GOP press secretary in the House to tell them that my show was a great forum for them to talk to Black America. None followed his admonition. When Michael Steele was chairman of the Republican National Committee, he did my show several times. Steele told me he went to the GOP House and Senate leadership to tell them they should accept my invites, but none did. Now if the GOP is scared to even come on a TV show that targets blacks, do you actually think they'll show up in a black community? If the GOP wants black folks to consider voting for them, they their candidates will have to make an effort to reach out. The distrust is wide and great, but it can be overcome. But doing nothing will get you nowhere, other than guarantee that a strong voting bloc will do all it can to make sure you are defeated at the polls. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland S. Martin.","Herman Cain said that black voters were ""brainwashed"" to support Democrats .

"(CNN) -- Four past or present United States presidents are among the nearly 100 world leaders joining celebrities and tens of thousands of South Africans to celebrate the life of Nelson Mandela Tuesday -- but some of the world's best-known leaders are not there. Some are staying home for health reasons, like Queen Elizabeth II and former Cuban President Fidel Castro. Pope Francis isn't coming because of protocol -- popes simply don't attend the funerals of world leaders. The situation with the Dalai Lama is a little more tricky. The Tibetan spiritual leader -- who is a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, as is Mandela -- was not granted a visa to visit South Africa the last two times he applied, likely because of pressure from China. He last tried to visit in 2011, for the 80th birthday celebrations of Desmond Tutu. The South African archbishop lashed out at his government for failing to grant the Dalai Lama permission to enter, comparing it to the apartheid regime he and Mandela worked to overturn. And the Dalai Lama predicted that, denied the visa, he would never see Mandela again. The Tibetan said at the time he was ""very much hoping to see Nelson Mandela, (who is) now very old. Now I have doubt whether I will have the occasion to meet Nelson Mandela or not."" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is staying away, officially, for more prosaic reasons -- his office cited the cost of the trip and the difficulty of organizing security on such short notice. A delegation headed by Knesset Speaker Yuli Edelstein will stand in for the Israeli leader. Likewise, Prince Charles of Wales will formally represent the Queen and Cardinal Peter Turkson of Ghana attends on behalf of the Pope.

"(CNN) -- Even in retirement Black Caviar -- arguably Australia's most celebrated racehorse with 25 victories from 25 starts -- shows no sign of fading from the media glare. Only recently the mare grabbed plenty of headlines after a statue was erected in her honor. But another equine retirement in recent weeks has passed without quite the same fanfare -- Vote for Lust being put out to pasture. Vote for Lust is the cart horse to super mare Black Caviar. ""He's just really, really bad,"" the horse's owner and trainer John Castleman told CNN. ""He just doesn't go fast."" Retirement came after its 90th run out -- ninety rides that came and went without a solitary victory. For all his lack of pace and panache on the race track -- Vote for Lust's career fittingly ended with him being 12-and-a-half lengths off the pace in his racing finale -- he has enjoyed something of a cult following in Australia, with both a Facebook and Twitter page set up in his name. Vote for Lust is indisputably Australia's worst race horse, with his closest rival being Jordi, who had 67 starts without a win. As for laying claim to being the world's worst, Vote for Lust is in with a good shout, although he has some serious competition. British horse Quixall Crossett was the first thoroughbred to lose 100 races in England in 2000 while the American horse Zippy Chippy also went 100 races without a win and also even lost a race with a minor-league baseball player. Fan favorite . But even Vote for Lust's owner and trainer John Castleman struggles to believe that there could possibly be a worse horse on the planet. Despite the track record of ignominy, Castleman admitted that hundreds of suitors had been lining up to buy this Australian underachiever after his retirement was announced. But family came first for Castleman, who gave Vote for Lust to his 14-year-old granddaughter. She is able to give him the sort of slow-speed riding that the 10-year-old specialized on the race course during his career. During Vote for Lust's career punters laid all manner of bets on him to win -- all to no avail -- though Castleman was wily enough never to dip into his pocket to back the ultimate no hoper. ""He's beaten one or two out there at home but never in a race,"" said Castleman. Twice on Melbourne Cup day, Vote for Lust ran in a two-horse race and on each occasion came home a distant second. His last realistic chance for victory came at the Horsham Maiden in June 2009, a race specifically for horses that have never won. True to form Vote for Lust was nowhere to be seen at the winning post. Sociable horse . Even jockey Glenn Boss -- a three-time Melbourne Cup winner -- could not get anything out of the luckless horse in a one-off outing. With the horse sponsored by the betting company Betfair, Boss was brought in to ride him in his 87th outing in a public relations gimmick. ""There was a point where I thought 'here we go', but that lasted all of about 100 meters before his usual canter kicked in,"" said Boss, who attributed Lust for Last's lack of competitiveness to his amiability. ""He likes the outing but he's sociable and just wants to stay in the pack with his mates. If he could have a beer and a steak sandwich, I reckon he would."" At the time, the jockey was asked if he felt Vote for Lust might finally pull off a victory in what was then the twilight of his career. His answer was, ""never say never,"" though Castleman's assessment, admittedly with a chuckle, was more brutal -- ""never."" There is a certain parental pride from the owner in just how bad Vote for Lust was. ""If he'd have won that would have been no good would it?"" he said. ""Anyway, it just was not meant to be."" In the yard, he was known as either 'Bogey' or 'Lusty' although Castleman admitted: ""There might have been other names too depending on what sort of mood I was in!"" Australians love a trier and to his credit there were times when Vote for Lust showed a glimmer of form -- usually in adverse weather conditions. ""There were a couple of occasions early on in his career when the rain was lashing down and he just kept on ploughing through. I thought he might have done it then. When he didn't do it then, I think I knew he'd never do it."" Calm nature . So why did Castleman keep on entering him in races? ""Well, horses don't pay for themselves do they?"" said Vote for Lust's owner. ""And anyway he'd still pick up some money for his places which would cover his feed and keep really."" For all the negativity about his racing prowess, or lack of it, Vote for Lust was invaluable as a horse for all occasions away from the track. ""He was good to have around the place, he was everyone's mate,"" said Castleman. ""He was quiet as hell and we'd take him to partner horses. He was so good natured, the calming influence on the more jittery horses. He just did everything you'd ever ask of him, that is apart from going fast. ""When we were breaking in horses, we'd have him tied up at the side and he'd just calm everyone down. He's just a bloody good bloke. For us, he was gold dust."" At races, Vote for Lust would welcome bigger crowds than the faster more successful horses. ""He's got quite a cult following, don't you worry about that,"" added Castleman. ""Everyone would want to get his picture taken with him. It's crazy to think someone put him on the internet and he ended up with hundreds of people following him. ""Just as he retired, we had seven radio stations ring up for interviews, and people rang up asking if he was for sale. He's much loved, just sadly not for the right reasons."" Equine genealogy . Vote for Lust would still be racing had it not been for an abscess on his foot. Castleman had hoped to take him to at least 100 runs, after which he planned to host some sort of a party. In the end, that was not to be. As for how he might have fared against Black Caviar, Castleman is certain that would have definitely have been a one horse race. ""There was a suggestion that he'd challenge Black Caviar in a race,"" said Castleman. ""That would have been the mother of all mismatches."" It is just a few weeks since he handed over the horse to his granddaughter, and he readily admits he misses having him around the place. But there is the potential for someone to follow in his footsteps. He has a half-sister and half-brother in Castleman's stable. The latter has been named 'He Ain't My Brother' to distance himself from his equine genealogy. Despite that, he can't quite break the family shackles. In his few races to date, he has yet to taste victory.","Vote for Lust failed to win a single race in 90 appearances before his recent retirement .

"(CNN) -- The memorials and tributes to the late Nelson Mandela have grown way past the flags flown at half-staff and the thousands of flowers and candles left at South African embassies throughout the world. In New York, the Empire State Building lit up in the colors of South Africa and the Apollo Theater in Harlem changed its marquee in tribute. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced Friday that a high school in Brooklyn will be renamed the Nelson Mandela School for Social Justice. The Omni Hotel in downtown Dallas also used lighting to create a South African flag on its faÃ§ade in commemoration. In Paris, the front of the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs was draped with an enormous portrait of the former South African President, who died Thursday at age 95. If this were a contest of creativity, the winner would likely be a massive sand sculpture of Mandela's face and the South African flag at a beach on the Bay of Bengal in Puri, India. That nation has declared five days of mourning. In Washington, the site where hundreds were arrested decades ago in a protest against apartheid was turned into a shrine its most memorable foe. The South African Embassy is under renovation, but a space was cleared in front of Mandela's statute there for mourners to place flowers. And in Johannesburg, people continued to stream to Mandela's home, bringing flowers and ribbons to add to the growing wall of color there.","From light shows to sand sculptures, Mandela tributes get creative .

"(CNN) -- Two weeks before Nelson Mandela's 93rd birthday on July 18, actress Alfre Woodard sits on a couch near her home in Santa Monica, California, reminiscing about the first time she met him. Already an activist and a leading voice against apartheid, Woodard introduced Mandela at a fundraising event in 1990 during his first trip to the United States after his release from prison. ""By the time I got on stage, I literally started to hop around ... I could not stop the electricity in my body,"" she said. ""So I went and I wrapped my arms around him, and I said to him in his ear, 'Oh Madiba, Madiba. How are you? Have you eaten? Have you slept?' And it became a really funny thing because 'Nobody has asked me that, Alfre, in my entire travels,'"" Woodard said with a laugh. ""So that sort of became the basis of our relationship."" Long before they met, Woodard's passion for social justice in South Africa had been growing since she was a student at Boston University. By 1989, she joined a handful of artists and actors, such as Danny Glover and Mary Steenburgen, to found what is now called Artists for a New South Africa (ANSA). They used their celebrity platform to shine a light on apartheid and lobby for sanctions against the regime. ""Once apartheid was crushed ... one of the things Madiba said to us was, 'You've helped us in our struggle to defeat apartheid, but right now we're facing another formidable foe -- and that is the HIV/AIDS pandemic,'"" she said. ""So we've morphed through the years of how we've wanted to be of assistance."" ANSA shifted its mission and in 2005 created an orphan care program called ""It Takes a Village"" to help around 3,500 AIDS orphans in South Africa. While working to combat the disease, Woodard's relationship with Mandela has grown both as an activist and a friend. She remembers receiving an invitation to a state dinner at the White House when Bill Clinton was president -- not from Clinton himself but from Mandela, who was being honored there. ""We were in the receiving line ... and he sees me about three people away and he leans over and he goes 'Alfre, Alfre! Remember me? It's Nelson,"" she said. ""And I said, 'Madiba, I don't think anybody will ever forget you and certainly not me."" Other times, their dinners were less formal. ""We continued to do political work together...and I'd always had the blessing and good fortune to be able to have a private meal with him. The first one was after he became president. ""The thing about Madiba is that immediately it's like having an audience with your ancestors ... because he recognizes you as a young person but he talks to you and expects things of you as an equal. And I think when people expect things of you, you realize that you're capable of it and you can do it."" During one of Woodard's trips to South Africa, she toured Robben Island, where Mandela spent many of his 27 years in prison. ""After hearing so much about it, it's this big, evil fortress that sucks the life out of good people ... I thought I would get there and be angry,"" she said. ""As Ahmed Kathrada [a South African politician who spent 18 years in prison on Robben Island] walked us through the cellblocks and talked about life there, he completely transformed the whole notion of imprisonment. I realized you could not be imprisoned. You can be held. But these men decided not to be in prison. And for me, it almost became a sacred place. ""I think what Madiba has demonstrated to all of us is not what he was capable of but what every single person is capable of ... it doesn't matter what circumstance you're put into. It's how you respond to circumstance. ""He gives us that not as an icon but as a human being, as a man, as a grandfather, as a father, as a person, as a Madiba to everybody.""","Alfre Woodard greeted Mandela on his first trip to the U.S. after his release from prison .

"(CNN) -- The most shocking thing about the arrest of a man linked to 79 killings may be that authorities don't find it shocking. At 20 years old, Juan Pablo Vazquez is accused of killing rivals, a policeman, a stripper and other innocent bystanders. But you won't find authorities in the northern economic hub of Monterrey, Mexico, using any superlatives to describe the alleged killer. Not the worst they've ever seen, not the most ruthless, not the youngest or most prolific. That's because Monterrey and its surroundings are an area disputed by rival drug cartels. From 2010 to the present, an average of 108 people have been killed each month in the state of Nuevo Leon, according to official statistics. Monterrey, the capital, has recorded 223 homicides so far this year. Vazquez's arrest, then, merited a press conference, but no celebration as if an alleged serial killer had been brought down. ""We are witnessing a very severe crisis because of the war between cartels,"" one Mexican official said. Vazquez was caught on October 8, but the arrest was not announced until Thursday. He was arrested together with a woman, Nancy Ortiz, who police said was selling drugs with Vazquez. The pair was caught with 35 baggies of weed and 22 packets of cocaine, the state's security secretariat said. The young man confessed to 45 killings, security officials said, and has been implicated in 34 other slayings between 2011 and this year. Fear of reprisals from the warring cartels means that officials keep details to a minimum, not even revealing what gang a suspect belongs to. The Mexican official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told CNN that Vazquez is a member of the Gulf cartel. The Gulf cartel is fighting with the Zetas cartel for lucrative smuggling routes to the United States. The official scoffed at the idea that Vazquez was any more dangerous or deadly than other alleged cartel hit men. He described Vazquez simply as the latest member of a large cell of assassins to be caught. Vazquez was not necessarily the shooter in all the cases, but was a witness or otherwise involved in the killings, the official said. Sometimes he was just one of several shooters who aimed at their targets. Cartel members who were arrested before him fingered him in connection with the 34 killings he did not confess to, the official said. And if the thought of a 20-year-old having a hand in 79 deaths sounds like an exaggeration, authorities released a list of dates and victims' names. Among the killings he is accused of: . -- A transit officer who pulled him over on March 13. -- An exotic dancer who had been kidnapped from a strip club on July 30. -- A woman who happened to be accompanying a member of a rival cartel on January 16. -- A group of eight rivals who were at a bar on August 13. The list goes on and on. It is just a small fraction of the number of homicides committed in Nuevo Leon, the official said.","Juan Pablo Vazquez was arrested earlier this month .

"ATHENS, Greece (CNN) -- A strong earthquake jolted western Greece on Sunday, killing at least two people and trapping several people beneath collapsed buildings, according to officials and state-run media. Rescuers remove a victim from a collapsed building after an earthquake struck Greece Sunday. Another 37 were hurt as a result of the quake, many as they tried to flee their homes, Greek Interior Minister Prokopis Pavlopoulos said at a news conference in Athens. The temblor struck around 3:30 p.m. [8:30 a.m. ET] and measured 6.1 in magnitude, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Athens' Geodynamic Institute registered the quake at 6.5 on the Richter scale -- which is no longer used by the USGS. Its epicenter was located about 20 miles [32 kilometers] southwest of the Greek port city of Patras. Pavlopoulos immediately dispatched a rescue and recovery team, which includes members of five government agencies, to assess the damage and needs in the quake-stricken Peloponnese region. So far, most of those reported trapped have been removed -- including a 43-year-old villager who died after his house collapsed on him, the interior minister said. The other victim died of a heart attack while being rushed to the hospital, he said. ""This is a very serious quake, but there will be no evacuations,"" Pavlopoulos said. iReport.com: Are you there?

Due to its fault lines, Greece is one of the most quake-prone countries in the European Union. A quake and aftershock both measuring over 6.4 in magnitude struck near Kalamata off the southern coast of the Peloponnese peninsula in mid-February, causing no major damage or injuries.

"Wisbech (CNN) -- Chatting casually over a pot of tea in the sleepy village of Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, Nick Leeson remarks on his time spent in a maximum security prison in Germany in 1995: ""That was the one time I contemplated suicide."" Thrown in with Yugoslav gunrunners, Bolivian drug lords and sex offenders, ""I wouldn't have been able to do it myself though,"" Leeson added, stirring in the milk. ""But there were these two Italian boys. One of them was an ice cream vendor, Luigi, and another well-dressed man, Salvatore. They were connected."" Leeson began sipping his tea, and suddenly laughed at how his story sounded like an episode from Italian mafia drama The Sopranos. Leeson, once considered the whiz kid of the Asian derivative markets before his bad trades on Japanese stocks collapsed UK merchant bank Barings, was thinking of doing a final deal: One with his own life. ""It would have cost me Â£10,000 ($15,268) I think,"" he said, struggling to remember, as if the detail is minor. ""I presumed it would happen in the showers one day, someone would just knife me."" From Watford to a Singapore prison . As the Watford-born Leeson sat regaling the most definitive time of his life, the anthem from Les Miserables ""I dreamed a dream,"" played on loop at the Rose & Crown Hotel, which is owned by his uncle-in-law. Leeson was due to give a speech for charity in the hotel that evening. It provided an eerily fitting soundtrack to his tale. The lyrics ""I was young and unafraid, and dreams were made and used and wasted"" resonate with Leeson's life. He went from high-flying trader to convicted fraudster, spending three and a half years in a gang-ridden Singapore prison. He has now joined GDP Partnership, an Irish restructuring firm. At the Rose & Crown, the couple on the next table appear unaware they are seated next to one of the 20th century's most infamous financial convicts. They're chatting about the hotel's renovations while Leeson is calculating the cost of his trades. ""The press were saying I could spend up to 84 years in prison,"" he said, offering me sugar. ""You don't have to be an MIT mathematician to work out I was gonna be dead."" ""I spoke to my wife and father about it [suicide],"" he said, explaining that they would have to negotiate the assisted suicide on his behalf from outside prison. ""Obviously they cried but you have to deal with the reality of situation."" Surviving jail, divorce and cancer . Almost 20 years on and having weathered incarceration, divorce and colon cancer, the man dubbed the ""original rogue trader"" now makes his money on the after-dinner speaking circuit; a far cry from his lucrative days earning $76,000 a year with bonuses of up to $228,000 as a trader speculating on Asian financial markets. When asked if he would press a magic button to take it all back, Leeson told CNN: ""There is no such button."" Describing himself as a ""realist,"" it may be hard to understand how he could have lost $1.3 billion, destroying a 233-year-old bank in the process. It's even harder to understand why he thought he could hide it away in a secret account known as the ""five eights."" Public perception of him as a symbol of capitalist greed may precede him, but Leeson doesn't shirk the responsibility. ""Nobody other than me should be accountable for what went wrong at Barings,"" he said. Leeson has no sympathy for rogue traders Jerome Kerviel of Societe Generale and Kweku Adoboli of UBS, who lost $6.4 billion and $1.8 billion respectively. ""Anything that they've done and hidden is fraud."" Leeson said abruptly. ""I think it's a macho culture that's evolved. When things go wrong, there's a certain age group that is usually involved; young men."" After leaving his desk and fleeing with his wife to Kuala Lumpur, Leeson resurfaced days later and was arrested in Frankfurt at the age of 28. Imprisoned and awaiting deportation to Singapore, Leeson started to reflect and accept responsibility for his actions. ""Prison was tough,"" said Leeson, who now found himself mixing with dangerous criminals from the Chinese and Malaysian underworld. ""I was the only white guy in there."" He rattled off details of a typical day of incarceration: ""You're locked up in a cell for 23 hours a day with two other people. You wake up at 6am in the morning and it's a hundred degrees outside. You get three books a month. So there's not much to occupy your mind."" Leeson could still recall the sores on his pelvis, ankles and elbows that he developed from sleeping on the floor. At the time, Leeson said he received messages of support to keep him sane, including nude photographs from air hostesses. ""I never got the naked pictures, I just got the letter,"" he joked. ""The Singaporean authorities took the good bit away."" Leeson paused for a moment, before recalling the darkest days of his incarceration. After a strip search and contraband swipe of his cell, he refused an order to return to a cell with two inmates he feared would fight. Leeson was punished, put in solitary confinement for 31 days. ""They would turn the lights on at night and turn them off in the day. There were no windows and there was a hole that they put your food through."" ""I used to walk up and down 780 times in the cell and that was an hour. That's how I passed time. You start singing to yourself."" Leeson chuckled. That was hard, because he didn't know the words to many songs. After his release from solitary confinement, Leeson was diagnosed with colon cancer. ""I had an emergency operation to remove a tumor in my stomach that was 9cm by 5cm. It was big."" Peering over my notebook, he pointed and added quickly as if to make sure I got the all the detail: ""Oh, and I had six months of chemotherapy in prison."" Leeson was released in 1999, aged 32. Broke, and with no job prospects, he returned to the UK, where he continued cancer treatment. Leeson overcame his illness, and set about rebuilding his life. He sold his story for a six-figure sum to the Daily Mail, wrote a book and had a film made about his time at Barings called ""Rogue Trader"" starring Ewan McGregor. But ""I've never seen a penny of it,"" he said. Barings' liquidators had served Leeson with an injunction of Â£100 million and took 50% of proceeds from his story. ""I asked them 'if I got a job flipping burgers, how much would you want?' and they told me ""half.'"" A quiet life in Ireland . Now 46, Leeson lives the quiet life in Galway, Ireland, and it's difficult to see from his retiring demeanor how he could have destroyed one of the world's most prestigious institutions. Leeson is philosophical about his past these days: ""I created a success story that everyone at the bank wanted to believe."" He laughed at how absurd that sounds now. Asked if a rogue trader will ever bring down a bank again, Leeson confidently replied: ""No doubt about it. If you ask anyone in the banking industry, they will say 'yes, but it won't be me.'""","Nick Leeson is dubbed the 'original rogue trader' for bad trades which collapsed Barings Bank .

"(CNN) -- Ronnie Smith believed in three things: teaching, Libya and Jesus Christ. The 33-year-old educator from Austin, Texas, was gunned down Thursday as he went on a morning jog outside his home in the Libyan city of Benghazi. No one has claimed responsibility for the slaying. Libyan authorities have pledged to investigate the killing, the latest in a series of assassinations in some Libyan cities. There have been near-daily targeted killings in Benghazi and Derna, with the victims mainly security forces, activists and members of the judiciary. Smith's death is a reminder of how dangerous eastern Libya has become, awash in weapons and armed groups since the 2011 ouster and street-mob killing of dictator Moammar Gadhafi. Smith moved to Libya a year and a half ago and took a job with the International School Benghazi, a new school on the outskirts of Benghazi where English was taught, according to its site. Hundreds of comments praising the teacher flooded the school's Facebook page within hours of his murder. ""You didn't have to know him to know what he was about -- which was respect, optimism, cooperation, team work,"" posted Noor Hewaidi. ""He believed in his students, and that's the greatest gift any teacher can grant a child."" Some grieved for his wife, Anita, and their young son who Smith often wrote about on his Twitter account. The teacher recently tweeted: ""It's official. I miss my family."" According to members of Smith's church back home in Austin where he served as a deacon, the teacher chose to stay in Libya while his wife and son returned to the States, because he wanted to support his students through midterm exams. Shortly after Smith's slaying, the Austin Stone Community Church removed from its website a video that shows Smith talking about his ""need to spread a spiritual message,"" according to CBS News. ""I want to go where no one could find a church if they wanted to, where no one has access to this gospel,"" Smith said of his impending trip to Libya. The church sent only parts of that video to CNN. In one part, Smith says, ""If there's any single person in the entire universe that you can take a chance on, it's God."" Another clip provided to CNN shows Smith lovingly looking at his wife, with the sun setting in the background, as he proclaims his strong belief that God will be with him in heaven. ""That can never be taken away from me no matter what happens,"" he says. ""I'm good. That gives me peace. I'm OK with that."" On Smith's personal page on the Austin Stone Community Church's site, he wrote about his devotion to Christ. ""I was raised in the church from the time I was an infant. It was only by the grace of God that I went through my high school and college years free from the major struggles that many of those I knew dealt with. It was not always sunshine and lollipops but God's hand was always leading me and He brought me to where I am today."" If the chemistry teacher could spend an evening with anyone who lived in the past 1,000 years, he wrote he would choose Jonathan Edwards, a Christian theologian who died in 1758. Edwards ""understood that God gave us minds for the soul purpose of glorifying Him. All of his writings and personal letters are saturated with Christ and he always seemed to have the glory of God in the forefront of his thinking. As a man of supreme intellect and prestige, he was refreshingly humble and holy. If I could model my life after anyone in the last 1000 years it would definitely be Edwards,"" the teacher posted. ""Ronnie's greatest desire was for peace and prosperity in Libya and for the people of Libya to have the joy of knowing God through Christ,"" Dave Barrett, executive pastor of Austin Stone Community Church, wrote on the church's site. Could Smith's openness about his beliefs have made him a target? Proselytizing has long been illegal in Libya. Since the 2011 revolution there has been a real phobia spreading among certain circles that Christians and Shiites are doing missionary work in the country, particularly in the eastern part of the country. Earlier this year, dozens of Egyptians were accused of proselytizing and were rounded up in Benghazi. According to some reports, Islamist militiamen tortured them. Pictures released at the time showed piles of Bibles and Christian children's coloring books. In the spring, the European Union Delegation in Tripoli said it was worried about the detention and treatment of people held on alleged charges of proselytism in the country. In March Coptic Christians in Benghazi had their church ransacked and set on fire. Before this attack, Egyptian Copts attacked the Libyan embassy in Cairo, burned the Libyan flag and erected a cross over the entrance, according to Foreign Policy. Around this time, Egyptian Christian Ezzat Atallah, arrested on charges of proselytizing, died while being held in Libya. He was reportedly tortured. CNN requested to speak with Barrett, who declined to answer questions and referred CNN to church spokesman Paul Lee. Lee said that Smith was not working as a missionary for the church in Libya but that the church does have missionary programs. Lee declined to say where in the world those missionary programs operate. Apart from being a country where religious expression could result in arrest or worse, Libya has been a particularly dangerous place for Westerners. On September 11, 2012, militants attacked a U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, killing four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens. Several Facebook posts on the international school's site about Smith allude to the ambassador. Mahmoud Agni wrote: ""I wish to God that justice take its way & I hope that God does not waste his blood like Chris Stevens."" ""I understand hatred for what the US government does,"" Brian Kav posted. ""This man was not the US government. He wanted to help kids learn."" Another post refers to Abu Anas al Libi, an alleged al Qaeda operative accused of playing a role in the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. U.S. special forces captured al Libi in Tripoli in October. He has pleaded not guilty to terrorism charges brought against him in federal court in New York. ""This is exactly what I said a few weeks ago after the stupid US foreign policy advisers OKed kidnapping the wrong guy from Libya,"" someone posted on the school Facebook page. ""You think his family will just stand still and wait for mercy? No. They will go around shooting random Americans or kidnapping them for revenge. This administration killed this teacher by their stupid acts. You kidnapped the Libyan guy and you don't even have a case against him and you just have him in a jail in NYC waiting for nothing. and you know you cannot bring a case against him because you have no case..."" A leading Libyan terrorism analyst told CNN that he believes Smith was killed by groups linked or sympathetic to al Qaeda. ""You need to analyze the target,"" said Noman Benotman, a senior analyst at the Quilliam Foundation. ""It was most likely he was targeted because of his nationality, and the groups most interested in doing that are al Qaeda and local Jihadists allied with them in Benghazi."" Benotman pointed to a 17-minute Arabic language video released last week in which American al Qaeda spokesman Adam Gadahn called for al Qaeda supporters in Libya to avenge al Libi's capture. ""I say to the people of Libya in particular and the sons of the Ummah in general: Do not leave this criminal cowardly act to pass without punishment,"" Gadahn stated, according to a translation by the SITE Intelligence group. Three days after al Libi's arrest, the American teacher expressed his opinion about Islamist hardliners. Smith tweeted: ""Libyan Islamists are threatening kidnappings. As if they can fit kidnapping in to their 2 hr work day that already includes a nap. Losers.""

"New York (CNN) -- The February 26 shooting of Trayvon Martin, a black teenager, by George Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, has in less than a month gone from a local story to a huge national story. As we all now know, Martin got into a confrontation with Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch captain patrolling a gated community in Sanford, Florida. Their confrontation ended when Zimmerman, who is licensed to carry a concealed weapon, shot the unarmed Martin. When the police failed to arrest Zimmerman partly because of the state's strong self-defense ""stand your ground"" law, the case raised outcries of racial injustice. In early March, a few major news outlets began reporting the story. By the middle of the month, interest heightened when tapes of Zimmerman's 911 call to the police revealed that he had been told by the dispatcher that he need not follow Martin, suggesting that he had been the aggressor. On March 23, President Barack Obama weighed in: ""If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon."" The most telling criticism of how the Martin case had been handled came from U.S. Rep. John Lewis, D-Georgia, whose involvement in the civil rights movement goes back to the Freedom Rides of the early 1960s. Lewis compared the killing of Martin with the infamous 1955 murder of Emmett Till in Mississippi. Fourteen-year-old Till was beaten and then shot for whistling at a white woman, or according to other accounts, saying ""bye, baby"" to her. No one was ever punished for killing Till. With the publication Monday by The Orlando Sentinel of a leaked police report supporting Zimmerman's version of events, the Martin case has, however, taken a new turn. In the report, Martin is the aggressor, punching Zimmerman in the nose and then beating him as he lay on the ground. This version of events, questioned by some in the wake of a newly released video of a seemingly unhurt Zimmerman in police custody, has been fodder for a counterattack on Martin's defenders. The New York Post carried a front page headline, ""Trayvon Hoodwink,"" above a story titled, ""Tragedy hijacked by 'race hustlers.' "" While the facts of the Trayvon Martin and Emmett Till cases differ and while what really happened in Sanford is still unclear, there is a parallel worth keeping in mind -- the announcement that the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice will open an investigation into the Martin case. From now on in, it will not be necessary to depend solely on Florida and Sanford authorities. The modern precedent for this kind of federal involvement in civil rights violence dates back to 1964. That year, the Justice Department took on the prosecution of the men accused of murdering James Chaney, Michael Schwerner and Andrew Goodman, three civil rights workers participating in the Mississippi Freedom Summer of 1964. It was a project, largely using college students from the North, that was designed to register black voters and begin freedom schools for Mississippi's black children. On the basis of a tip in August, the bodies of the three civil rights workers, who had disappeared in June, were found by the FBI buried in an earthen dam in Philadelphia, Mississippi. Then in December, on the basis of information gathered from informants, the Justice Department charged 19 men, including a sheriff and deputy sheriff, for conspiring to violate the civil rights of the murdered men. The charge, based on laws that had been passed in 1870 in the wake of the Civil War to protect black freedmen and Republicans, was the best instrument the Justice Department could rely on at the time. The alternative to a federal conspiracy case was state prosecution for murder, but in the Mississippi of the 1960s, no one believed that the state could win such a case or had any real desire to pursue it. The week after the bodies of the three men were found, Gov. Paul Johnson, speaking at the Neshoba County Fair, delivered a speech in which he declared, ""Integration is like Prohibition. If people don't want it, a whole army can't enforce it."" Johnson spoke for the majority of white Mississippians, and in December 1964 when the Justice Department sought to bring its case before a grand jury, the U.S. commissioner for the Southern District of Mississippi dismissed the charges against the 19 men, saying that the confession the Justice Department had from one of those indicted was hearsay evidence because only an FBI agent had heard it. In January 1965, the Justice Department managed, however, to win indictments from a federal grand jury in Jackson. Then it ran into another setback when a Mississippi judge, William Harold Cox, threw out the most substantive parts of the grand jury indictments. It took a full year before the Supreme Court overruled Cox and the Justice Department's case was back on track. Finally, in October 1967, the trial began in Meridian, Mississippi, before the same Judge Cox whom the Supreme Court had overruled. The government team was headed by John Doar, the assistant attorney general for civil rights, who through long experience had come to know how hard it was to win a civil rights case in the South. Doar understood that he faced a particularly tough challenge, and he made a point of telling the jury he was personally taking the lead in trying the case not because he was experienced in criminal law but because he headed the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department. For Doar, it was crucial for the jury to understand what was at stake, and he went out of his way to remind them that the defendants were being tried ""in a Mississippi city, before a Mississippi federal judge, in a Mississippi courtroom, before 12 men and women from the state of Mississippi."" In the end Doar and the Justice Department did not get the complete victory they wanted. But they did get a victory that few initially thought possible. Thirteen days after the trial began, seven of the 19 defendants, including a deputy sheriff, were convicted. It had taken three years to reach this point, but what the Justice Department had established was its ability to win a civil rights case in the Deep South even before hostile juries. The conviction of the seven men was upheld, and they began serving time after their appeal was turned down in 1970. Today, Doar's role is remembered by few people who were not part of the civil rights movement of the 1960s. But the case he and the Justice Department won nearly a half century ago lives on, demonstrating that neither local nor state justice need be the last word in the shooting of Trayvon Martin. With the Martin case, the Civil Rights Division has another opportunity to settle justice and if it acts with enough speed, defuse some of the tensions that the killing of Trayvon Martin has raised throughout the country. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nicolaus Mills.","State prosecutors have not brought charges in shooting death of Trayvon Martin .

"London (CNN) -- Britain's Prince Charles made a heartfelt appeal Thursday for the world to come together to end the ""appalling trade"" annihilating threatened wildlife such as elephants and tigers in Africa and Asia. His speech at the London Conference on the Illegal Wildlife Trade called for high-level action by world leaders to be matched by action on the ground to stop the demand for illegal products and punish those involved in the trade. The conference was the culmination of a week of events aimed at galvanizing efforts to halt the slaughter of endangered animals for their bones, hides or tusks -- much in demand in parts of Asia. In a declaration agreed to at the end of the summit, leaders pledged to strengthen enforcement to protect animals at risk of poaching, to impose tougher sanctions on all those involved in the illegal wildlife trade, and to address related corruption and bribery. They also agreed to destroy stockpiles of seized wildlife products -- an issue which has been contentious in the past. Prince Charles in his speech praised the United States, China and France for having recently destroyed substantial stockpiles of seized ivory. John G. Robinson, chief conservationist for the Wildlife Conservation Society, welcomed the declaration, saying it ""sends a strong message across the globe: Wildlife trafficking is a serious crime, on a global scale, and must be tackled at all levels as a matter of urgency. ""The declaration calls for a global crackdown on wildlife crime and on the corruption and organized criminal activities that feed it."" Forest elephants decimated . The conference was held as new figures from the Bronx Zoo-based Wildlife Conservation Society revealed that a massive 65% of forest elephants in Central Africa were lost to poaching between 2002 and 2013. Based on research across 80 sites in five countries, a study shows that forest elephants are being killed for their ivory at ""a shocking 9% per year,"" the conservation group said. As a result, they occupy only about a quarter of the area they once roamed -- with the forests of the huge Democratic Republic of the Congo notably almost empty of elephants. Researcher Fiona Maisels, a co-author of the study, said that at least 200,000 forest elephants were lost between 2002 and 2013, ""to the tune of at least 60 a day, or one every 20 minutes, day and night."" She added, ""By the time you eat breakfast, another elephant has been slaughtered to produce trinkets for the ivory market."" Prince: Dire situation in Africa . Charles said he had been approached a little over a year ago by a group of presidents from Africa who made an impassioned plea for help. ""The situation they described was indeed dire,"" he said. ""The scale of the poaching crisis their countries were facing had reached unimaginable heights. Organized gangs, terrorist groups and militia were slaughtering ever greater numbers of elephants for their ivory and rhinoceros for their horns."" Now, the forests and savannahs are ""frighteningly silent,"" he said, and without elephants to aid in seed germination, the long-term ecology of many forests is ""fatally disrupted."" The problem of poaching is not just in Africa, he said, since wildlife in Asia, particularly India, is also being decimated. The leaders gathered in London will sign a declaration that includes new pledges to tackle the demand for and consumption of illegally traded wildlife products, Charles said. ""Most recently, demand from Asia -- particularly China -- has fueled the trade, but we also know that the United States and Europe are contributing to it,"" he said. At the same time, he said, recent initiatives taken around the world to destroy seized ivory, curb consumption of shark fin soup and protect snow leopards showed that concerted action could work. UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said the issue was an unprecedented crisis that demanded a global response. ""But this is not just an environmental crisis,"" he said. ""This is now a global criminal industry, ranked alongside drugs, arms and people trafficking. It drives corruption and insecurity, and undermines efforts to cut poverty and promote sustainable development, particularly in African countries."" U.S. market for ivory called second biggest . With the issue taking center stage, U.S. President Barack Obama signed off this week on a ""National Strategy for Combating Wildlife Trafficking,"" which sets out ways to stem the illegal trade. Its stated priorities are to strengthen enforcement, reduce demand for illegally trafficked wildlife and work more closely with international partners. U.S. Humane Society President Wayne Pacelle welcomed the step in a blog post Wednesday, but he said the group was still working toward the prohibition of all ivory trade in the country. The United States is the second largest ivory marketplace worldwide, after China, he said, in part because it's still legal to trade in ""antique"" ivory more than 100 years old and non-elephant ivory, such as mammoth ivory. ""Traffickers claim that ivory from recently poached elephants is antique, and they dye it to make it look old and forge documents to substantiate their claim. Or they traffic elephant ivory as 'mammoth ivory' or some other ivory-bearing species because those are not protected by law,"" he wrote. It's almost impossible for members of the public or enforcement officers to tell the old from the new, Pacelle said, which ""adds up to a robust legal and illegal trade of ivory"" in the United States, particularly in Hawaii. ""It's just not worth putting elephants at risk in order to preserve a limited trade in antique ivory or ivory imported before certain dates,"" he said. ""People can live without it, and we know that even a modest amount of trade is likely to lead to widespread killing of elephants."" CNN's Ingrid Formanek contributed to this report.","NEW: Leaders agree to global steps to combat illegal wildlife trade at London summit .

"(CNN) -- It was written as a moving tribute to what seemed a promising love affair. But, in retrospect, even the songwriter acknowledges that the words to ""You're Mine"" -- written months ago for Montana bride Jordan Linn Graham -- are ""a little creepy."" ""Everyone wants a safe place to fall, and you're mine,"" Elizabeth Shea wrote in the song for Graham, months before Graham would be accused of shoving her husband, Cody Johnson, off a cliff during an argument. The song was played at their wedding. ""I used words like 'you helped me to climb higher for a better view. You're my safe place to fall. You never let me go,' "" said Shea, who writes custom songs for a living. ""And so now, when I hear those words, it's a little creepy."" Graham is accused on a federal charge of second-degree murder. Authorities say she pushed her husband of eight days face-first off a cliff at Glacier National Park in Montana during an argument July 7. Court documents say Graham acknowledged pushing Johnson. Searchers found his body days later. According to investigators, Graham had been having second thoughts about the relationship and had gone for a hike at the park with Johnson to discuss her reservations. Shea said Graham seemed like any other bride, nervous, stressed and excited -- if a bit reserved. Graham even worked extra hours to afford the songwriting and recording fee for the custom song, Shea said. ""She was excited when she talked about the wedding. When she talked about surprising Cody, she would light up, and that seemed very genuine to me,"" Shea said. The case is being heard in federal court because the incident occurred in a national park. On Thursday, a judge ordered Graham released on bail to await trial.","Montana bride accused of shoving husband to death commissioned a custom song .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- Cash Burnaman, a 6-year-old South Carolina boy, has traveled with his parents to India seeking treatment for a rare genetic condition that has left him developmentally disabled. You might think this was a hopeful mission until you learn that an overwhelming number of medical experts insist the treatment will have zero effect. Cash is mute. He walks with the aid of braces. To battle his incurable condition, which is so rare it doesn't have a name, Cash has had to take an artificial growth hormone for most of his life. His divorced parents, Josh Burnaman and Stephanie Krolick, are so driven by their hope and desperation to help Cash they've journeyed to the other side of the globe and paid tens of thousands of dollars to have Cash undergo experimental injections of human embryonic stem cells. The family is among a growing number of Americans seeking the treatment in India -- some at a clinic in the heart of New Delhi called NuTech Mediworld run by Dr. Geeta Shroff, a retired obstetrician and self-taught embryonic stem cell practitioner. Shroff first treated Cash -- who presents symptoms similar to Down Syndrome -- in 2010. ""I am helping improve their quality of life,"" Shroff told CNN. After five weeks of treatment, Cash and his parents returned home to the U.S. That's when Cash began walking with the aid of braces for the first time. His parents were thrilled. Before the treatments, Cash could only get around by hopping, his mother said. The results were enough to persuade Cash's mother to go back to Shroff for more help. ""We saw evidence the first time that it's worth trying again,"" Krolick said. ""In this particular case, with Cash's other conditions, we don't have many other options."" For four or five weeks of treatment, Shroff says she has charged her 87 American patients an average of $25,000. It's a big financial hit for Burnaman, a volunteer firefighter and property manager, and Krolick, who attends technical college in Greenville, South Carolina. But the boy's family and friends went into fundraising mode, creating a blog called ChangeForCash.com, and amassing about $50,000 over a year. Are patients like Cash truly receiving treatments that improve their quality of life? Or is therapy giving patients false hope? Doctors say all that work and hope and money Cash's supporters have funneled into his experimental therapy likely will have no medical benefits. There are several types of stem cells. Adult stem cells can be found in mature cells and some organs.  For example, bone marrow cells are a type of adult stem cell that have been used in transplants for more than 40 years.  But because adult stem cells are taken from parts of the body that already have a purpose, they may be limited as to what they can be turned into. Embryonic stem cells are the controversial ones because they're harvested from leftover IVF embryos, which are then destroyed in the process. Embryonic stem cells come from 4-or 5-day-old fertilized eggs and have the ability to turn into any type of cell in the body. Since human embryonic stem cells were first discovered in 1998, researchers have been trying to take these unique cells and coax them into becoming cells for every part of the body, which then could be used to repair damage or regenerate tissue. For many years a virtual ban on funding this type of research slowed the field down. Researchers have developed another source of stem cells: skin cells.  Scientists learned to turn the clock back on skin cells so they're like embryos -- with stem cells that have the same ""blank slate"" properties like embryonic stem cells -- but without the controversy.  These cells are called ""IPS"" (induced pluripotent stem) cells -- and are not yet being used in human experiments. There are no approved embryonic stem cell treatments in the United States. However, the Food and Drug Administration has approved two experimental clinical trials in humans using treatments made from human embryonic stem cells. One of these -- to repair spinal cord injuries -- was stopped due to the high cost of this type of research; the other trial -- to restore vision in people with macular degeneration -- is still underway. There is hope that embryonic stem cells might someday lead to treatments for Parkinson's disease, diabetes, traumatic spinal cord injury, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and other conditions, according to the National Institutes of Health. Someday. Nevertheless, Shroff isn't waiting for further research. She's injecting patients with embryonic stem cells now. ""There is zero evidence for what she is doing being effective,"" said Rutgers University's Dr. Wise Young, a leading U.S. neuroscientist. ""It's concerning no matter how you look at it,"" said CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta. ""Frankly it's the complete wrong way of going about this sort of science."" Inside her clinic, surrounded by patients, Shroff disagreed. ""Success,"" she said, ""is defined differently by various groups of people within that therapy mode. So as of right now, almost everyone -- greater than 90% -- have had success."" But Cash's family has its doubters, too. The boy's father said he still isn't totally convinced the treatment works. ""If we had taken away the stem cells and hadn't done it, is this where he would be naturally?"" Burnaman said. ""And that's where I keep coming back to is -- I'm not sure."" ""It's risky medical therapy,"" acknowledged Krolick, who feared it would worsen Cash's condition. ""But I knew that we were going to have to do it. We did pick this clinic for a reason. I mean, we did look around, and we decided this is the place where we felt safe. She had a good track record."" An energetic doctor who trained in India, Shroff says she acquired embryonic stem cells with the patient's permission after she performed an in-vitro fertilization procedure on a woman more than a decade ago. She would not allow CNN access to the facility where she says the embryonic cells are kept and harvested. Nurses and assistants at NuTech Mediworld routinely inject patients with embryonic stem cells daily simply by sticking the needle into a patient's back. The routine at the clinic starkly contrasts with procedures CNN observed at a sanctioned embryonic stem cell trial at Atlanta's Emory University, where technicians and surgeons took hours to conduct a safe injection. NuTech Mediworld's treatment also includes physical therapy. The patient and a guest receive room and board. The rooms are cramped with bathroom facilities available down a long hallway. Shroff has treated patients suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or ALS, more commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease. Others had spinal cord injuries, cerebral palsy, genetic and muscular skeletal disorders. Pure embryonic stem cells are not meant to be put directly into the body, since they have to the potential to turn into any cell. That's why credible researchers first chemically ""coax"" these stem cells into heading down the path of what they should turn into -- for example nerve cells or heart cells -- before injecting them into very specific parts of the body to achieve the desired results. The doctor offered examples of her successes including a man from Baghdad who she said was a paraplegic because of multiple gunshot wounds and an Indian toddler who she said has a genetic disorder similar to Cash's. Kohl Guffey, an 18-year-old from Illinois who was paralyzed three years ago in a motocross accident, cites himself as another example of success at the clinic. ""Before I came here, I didn't have any movement in my left hand between my fingers,"" said Guffey. ""Now I can retract them really good."" Shroff conceded that when she attempted to present her findings to an internationally sanctioned stem cell conference, her medical abstract paperwork was rejected. But she continues to defend her work. ""I believe that my patients are getting better,"" she said. ""I have proved it time and time and time again."" She was present at a recent meeting of the Indian Council of Medical Research where prominent Indian physicians criticized embryonic stem cell clinics that have appeared in New Delhi and elsewhere throughout the sprawling country. A leading Indian neurosurgeon, Dr. P.N. Tandon, agreed there was zero medical evidence of the effectiveness of embryonic stem cell therapy like that provided at NuTech Mediworld. There is no stem cell treatment proven in India that will make patients like these better, Tandon said, and none ""proven anywhere in the world."" Patients also have traveled for similar therapy in Central America, Mexico and China, although that country has recently clamped down on stem cell clinics. For Young, the money charged for the therapy stands out as an ethical issue. ""It's all about $25,000,"" he said. The cost of the treatment is ""calculated to take a family to the brink of what they can afford, and they take everything."" ""Who doesn't want to get rich?"" Shroff asked. ""Who doesn't work for money? But you also have to work from the heart. You also have to see what you're doing. Is it ethically right? And I believe I am doing everything right.""

"(CNN) -- Just two days before the tragic shooting deaths of 26 helpless people in a Connecticut elementary school, Illinois' governor was lamenting a major court defeat for the state's lonely ban on concealed weapons. The 7th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Chicago had just struck down one of the most restrictive gun-control laws in the nation. Illinois was the last remaining state where it was completely illegal to carry a concealed weapon in public. ""I think it's important that we stress that public safety comes first,"" Gov. Pat Quinn, a Democrat and gun-control supporter, said Wednesday. ""I think that's where the people of Illinois are on this issue and anything having to do with guns and assault weapons like that. We cannot have those sorts of people eligible to carry loaded weapons on their persons in public places, whether it be malls or churches or schools."" Poll: Americans changing on gun control . By ""those,"" the governor meant people with a history of domestic violence or mental illness. Officials in Connecticut have said 20 children and six adult educators died in Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown after a 20-year-old gunman forced his way in and began shooting. The killer apparently ended the spree by taking his own life. Three weapons were found near him, including a Bushmaster AR-15 ""assault-type rifle."" Police later found his mother dead at their home. The horrific event has left many lawmakers, community leaders, families of gun violence victims, and advocates on both sides of the gun-control debate calling for some kind of action -- including a collective re-examination of the extent of rights enshrined in the Constitution, and by centuries of tradition and practice. For all the political talk, however, it has usually been left to the courts -- and ultimately the Supreme Court -- to sort out what is constitutionally acceptable. Judges have taken into account legislative prerogatives, shifting public opinion, and even the headlines from tragedies like Newtown when crafting always controversial decisions. The conservative majority U.S. Supreme Court in recent years has been wary of some kinds of gun-control laws, but say lawmakers can still impose ""reasonable"" restrictions. That somewhat flexible standard will guide any fresh legislative attempts on the state and federal level to impose tighter ownership controls. In the Illinois ruling, the 2-1 majority led by federal Judge Richard Posner gave state lawmakers 180 days to draft a new law ""that will impose reasonable limitations"" on publicly carrying a gun without violating the guidelines they articulated. Opinion: Why Obama shouldn't lead fight against gun violence . ""There is no suggestion that some unique characteristic of criminal activity in Illinois justifies the state's taking a different approach from the other 49 states,"" said Posner, who was appointed to the bench by President Reagan. ""If the Illinois approach were demonstrably superior, one would expect at least one or two other states to have emulated it."" The judge said the law came close to total prohibition on carrying a gun in public, which would prevent ""a person from defending himself anywhere except inside his home"" and would be ""so substantial a curtailment of the right of armed self-defense"" that it ""requires greater showing of justification"" for enacting it. Illinois lawmakers passed the law in response to growing street violence in urban areas like Chicago, which has seen a spike in gang-related shootings, especially involving young people. The appeals judges cited as a precedent a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling in a separate case, also from Chicago. The justices in 2010 tossed out the city's three-decade ban on handgun ownership. The 5-4 conservative majority of justices reiterated its earlier conclusion the Constitution gives individuals equal or greater power than states on the issue of possession of certain firearms for self-protection in the home. ""It cannot be doubted that the right to bear arms was regarded as a substantive guarantee, not a prohibition that could be ignored so long as states legislated in an evenhanded manner,"" wrote Justice Samuel Alito. The justices, however, said local jurisdictions still retained the flexibility to preserve some ""reasonable"" gun-control measures already in place. The debate then and now for judges is how far they can apply competing parts of the 14th Amendment to preserve -- and define -- those ""reasonable"" legislative efforts. Opinion: Gun control: Change is possible -- and fast . Also vexing the judicial debate is whether the constitutional ""right of the people to keep and bear arms"" applies to local gun control ordinances or only to federal restrictions. That basic question had remained unanswered for decades, but the current high court now seems to allow Americans expanded weapon ownership rights. But legal observers noted last week's ruling regarding Illinois' ready-to-use gun law went further than what the Supreme Court has said -- over whether the right of self-defense extends beyond the home, to the street and other public places. The Justice Department estimates as many as 275 million guns are in the United States. In 2005, three-quarters of the 10,100 homicides by firearms nationwide were committed with handguns. Underpinning the legal basis for the court's jurisdiction in these kinds of gun-control appeals is a complex reading of the 14th Amendment, passed in the wake of the Civil War to ensure all citizens -- including newly freed slaves -- were protected from state laws that might restrict their fundamental rights. One part ensures states cannot deprive people of ""life, liberty, or property, without due process of law."" That has been commonly applied by federal courts when it comes to disputes over basic rights, so-called ""ordered liberty"" cases. Such cases include affirming the right to abortion, and to homosexual sex. But another rarely used provision also prevents states from depriving the ""privileges or immunities"" of all citizens. The specific question for the high court in the Chicago case was whether the ""immunities and privileges"" clause should be used to overturn the handgun ban. An 1873 ruling limited use of that provision when considering a variety of state laws. Analysis: Why gun controls are off the agenda in America . All states but Illinois currently allow at least some limited ability to carry a concealed weapon in public, often requiring ""good cause"" by an individual before a permit is issued. Four states -- Vermont, Arizona, Alaska, and Wyoming -- do not require any permit for a concealed weapon. After the latest mass shooting event, several congressional lawmakers have promised to introduce tougher gun-control measures in coming weeks. One pending bill is the Fix Guns Check Act, requiring a criminal background check for all gun sales. Such checks are already mandatory for licensed gun dealers, but not for private sellers -- who, supporters of the law say, may sell weapons at guns shows or online without such background checks. And there have been federal calls for extending the current ban on so-called ""assault weapons"" to include other types of military-style weapons and those with high-capacity magazines. As for the Illinois law, its supporters appeared divided -- at least initially in the wake of the appeals court's decision -- on whether they can or should redraft a ""concealed carry"" law, one that can meet the judicial mandate. One thing is certain: a Supreme Court appeal will come in the next few months, and another potentially history-making test of individual gun rights. Opinion: How UK school massacre led to tighter gun control . ""Today's ruling is a major victory for law-abiding Illinoisans -- and for everyone who understands that the Second Amendment protects the right both to keep arms and to bear arms,"" said Chris Cox, executive director of NRA's Institute for Legislative Action, just after the 7th Circuit decision last week. ""This ruling makes clear that Illinois cannot deny law-abiding residents the right to carry a firearm for self-defense outside the home. This is a step in the right direction for all gun owners. We know it probably won't be the end of this case, and we're ready to keep fighting until the courts fully protect the entire Second Amendment."" Gun control is one of those hot-button social issues that stirs energies on competing sides. The rhetoric naturally becomes more heated -- and personal -- in the raw aftermath of events like the shootings in Newtown. The impact of rulings from the Supreme Courts and lower court judges acting in their mandate always come with lingering reminders of these kinds of tragedies from across the nation, as local communities wrestle with whether banning often the cheapest, most commonly available kinds of firearms will reduce violent crime or leave honest citizens vulnerable. The Illinois concealed carry ruling is Moore v. Madigan (12-1269). Opinion: Put reason back in America's gun debate .","A federal appeals court has struck down an Illinois law restricting guns .
Gov. Pat Quinn said people in the state want officials to put public safety first .

"(CNN) -- Ask Gavin MacLeod about virtually anybody, and he'll have something nice to say. Cary Grant? ""To look like him for 10 minutes."" Gregory Peck? ""What a gentleman."" Frank Sinatra? ""One of the great moments of my life, getting to shake that man's hand."" Except Bette Davis. Oh, MacLeod's not angry. But in his new memoir, ""This Is Your Captain Speaking"" (written with Mark Dagostino and out Tuesday ), he has an amusing story about inviting Davis to dinner during the height of his early '80s ""Love Boat"" fame. The Hollywood grande dame proved to be less than a gracious guest. Davis argued with another guest, upset MacLeod's wife and, afterward, insulted her hosts in the newspaper. But even with Davis, MacLeod looks on the sunny side. ""We got a good story and a good laugh out of it,"" he writes in the book. MacLeod is a happy guy. His enthusiasm and generous spirit run through his new memoir like bright threads. In the midst of recollections about his early stage career, his years as a character actor in countless TV shows and his well-known turns on ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" and ""The Love Boat,"" he'll slow down the recollections to pay tribute to former co-stars and little-known colleagues with a ""Wow!"" and ""Can you imagine?"" He drops exclamation points frequently, still stunned that his life has worked out so well. ""It's been a great, great ride,"" MacLeod, 82, said in a phone interview. ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"": Where are they now? Sure, the ride's had a few bumps for MacLeod, born Allan See in Westchester County, New York. He lost his father when he was 13. He suffered through years of alcoholism, which led to the end of his first marriage -- a tale he tells without self-pity in the book. ""I was ugly when I drank,"" he writes. ""The fighting was miserable, and very much my fault."" Until finally breaking through in his late 30s as ""MTM's"" even-keeled newswriter Murray Slaughter, he had a steady but unexceptional career as a character actor. He got his start on stage in the drama ""A Hatful of Rain"" and later attracted notice in Los Angeles for playing a drug dealer in a play called ""The Connection,"" which led to roles as villains in such shows as ""Hawaii Five-O."" It was Murray -- and then Capt. Merrill Stubing on ""The Love Boat,"" through which he became a spokesman for Princess Cruises -- that established MacLeod's on-screen good-guy bona fides. He has found strength in his Christian faith and in his long marriage to his wife, Patti. CNN spoke to MacLeod by phone from his home in Southern California. The following is an edited and condensed version of the interview: . CNN: Acting can be a very challenging business. How do you stay upbeat? Gavin MacLeod: You get turned down more than you get accepted, so you get used to that negativity. It's just part of the life. A lot of hope goes into being an actor, especially when you're young, and especially not having any hair. CNN: Tell me about that. MacLeod: Being bald at a young age turned out to be an asset for me. When I came out to Hollywood in 1957, I started doing shows at Desilu. I'd do two shows in a week. I'd do one with my hair on, then take my hair off, put on a suit and have another little dialogue change and be the head of a mob. I got a lot of training that way because of being bald. CNN: You played a lot of heavies and small character roles until ""Mary Tyler Moore."" MacLeod: I really did. What surprises me is how people know about your career who you've never met. I was on (a cruise) one time, and one guy asked, ""How is Maisie?"" and I said, ""Who is Maisie?"" and he said, ""In 'Operation Petticoat,' the tattoo on your chest of the naked girl."" You become a part of people's lives in ways you'll never know. CNN: Did you feel like taking ""MTM"" was a risk? MacLeod: Not at all. I had worked with Mary before, and she and (producer) Grant (Tinker), her husband, had seen me do a lot of plays on the West Coast. I knew her a little bit from working with her on ""The Dick Van Dyke Show."" And the script was so good. CNN: They wanted you for Lou Grant. (Ed Asner eventually played the role.) MacLeod: Lou Grant was wonderful, but I wouldn't believe myself in that role. But Murray, I thought I could do something with him. That's something I tell actors when I talk to them. If you have an instinct about something, follow that instinct. If I didn't risk saying (to the producers), ""I really like Murray Slaughter. I think I can do something with it."" ... They had to readjust their thinking, because he wasn't the lead role. And that was the beginning of a wonderful seven-year relationship. CNN: You reveled in the character of Murray Slaughter, but Ted Knight wrestled with the character of Ted Baxter. People confused the actor with the fake anchorman. MacLeod: Well, his character was so vivid. He was so funny. Grant Tinker used to come up in the audience, even by himself, to watch rehearsals, and roar at Ted. (The) concept was based on a lot of different people. There was a big guy named George Putnam. He was the biggest newscaster on the West Coast. I did a Christmas parade, and he was one of the guests. He was riding on a horse, and I was in a car, and he says, ""GAVIN! I'M THE REAL TED BAXTER!"" And he was so proud of it. (But) Ted had that image, and it wore on him. Finally he did get to have ""Too Close for Comfort"" and ""The Ted Knight Show."" CNN: It must be tough. You've had such indelible roles that people may find it hard to think of you as something besides Murray or Capt. Stubing. MacLeod: It becomes a part of people's lives. The thing about Stubing, I tried to make him as likable as I could. He was written differently -- he was written as a stern person. But we realized if you're going to have a series that's going to run, people don't want to see that kind of figure week after week. So we started to change him and tap into me more. That's how he became the caring man, the father figure. CNN: ""Mary"" was beloved by critics. Not so for ""The Love Boat."" MacLeod: The critics hated our show. But I remember when we went to church one Sunday. A lady stopped me, and said, ""Aren't you the captain?"" I say, ""Yes."" She says, ""I love the messages you give us, because they're covered with cotton candy."" What a great phrase that is. And writing on that level is very hard to do. CNN: What lessons do you hope people draw from the book? MacLeod: Never give up. Don't be afraid to risk. And if you have a dream, go for it. Don't let anybody step on your dream. You have one life; you want to make the most of it.","Gavin MacLeod has new memoir, ""This Is Your Captain Speaking""

Ed Parker, the expedition director of the Virgin Money South Pole Allied Challenge, revealed Saturday that he'd made the decision to call off the competition among three teams to reach the pole after five days. ""The reason for this is entirely simple -- safety, which remains the core principal of our expeditions,"" Parker said in a statement. It wasn't bad weather that led to the decision, and Parker even said that ""all three teams were progressing well"" over the first five days. Rather, it was the fact that the mission -- especially as a competition -- was putting undue strain on the participants. ""It was becoming evident that there was a higher degree of stress imposed on the team members, due to unprecedented terrain on the plateau,"" said Parker, a former British soldier who co-founded Walking With The Wounded in 2010. Prince Harry -- himself a member of Britain's armed forces, having served in Afghanistan and elsewhere -- has had a long association with this charity. In several ways, he's been preparing for this latest mission for a long time. That includes taking part in a Walking With The Wounded expedition to the North Pole -- even plunging into the Arctic Ocean's freezing waters -- in 2011 before withdrawing to attend his brother William's wedding. More recently, he traveled to Iceland for training and even spent 24 hours in an industrial freezer in preparation for the South Pole race. Yet, while Harry may be the only royal in Antarctica, he's hardly the only celebrity. Swedish actor and ""True Blood"" star Alexander Skarsgard is an honorary member of the U.S. team, while Dominic West, perhaps best known for his role as McNulty in ""The Wire,"" joins veterans wounded in combat from the Commonwealth nations of Canada and Australia. Still, the stars -- and focus of the event -- are the veterans themselves. The three teams of seven participants each represent the United Kingdom, United States and the Commonwealth, which consists of several countries long affiliated with the British empire. The plan was to trek more than 200 miles (322 kilometers) across the sparse continent, in temperatures as low as -35 degrees Celsius (-31 Fahrenheit). And that's still the plan; it's just that they won't be racing. The participants on Sunday are set to resuming the walk, hoping to traverse the 70 remaining miles to the South Pole ""with no stress being placed on the teams ... enabling them all to do this in their own time,"" Parker explained. Parker said he expects them all to reach that, by Friday or Saturday of next week, all of them will be at the finish ""celebrating."" CNN's Pierre Meilhan, Max Foster and Susannah Cullinane contributed to this report.","The Virgin Money South Pole Allied Challenge is nixed, its director says .

"(CNN) -- Russian authorities have revealed the whereabouts of a convicted Pussy Riot punk rock band member, three weeks after she was moved from a prison where she went on hunger strike over its conditions. On November 2, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova's husband, Pyotr Verzilov, said his wife had not been heard from since she was transferred from a prison in Mordovia, more than 300 miles east of Moscow on October 24 or 25. Under law, authorities had to inform her family about her transfer within 10 days of her arrival at a different penal colony. On Thursday, Russia's prison service confirmed that Tolokonnikova, 24, had been moved to a prison in the Krasnoyarsk region of Siberia and that her relatives had been informed. Verzilov told CNN Friday that he had spoken to his wife, who was being examined in a hospital after her transfer. Tolokonnikova felt OK and was happy with staff at the hospital, he said. He was in Krasnoyarsk and hoped to see her at the beginning of next week. Tolokonnikova was sent to Mordovia last year for her part in a performance of a ""punk prayer"" critical of Vladimir Putin, who was then Russia's Prime Minister and is now the country's President. The performance was held at a Russian Orthodox cathedral. Found guilty of ""hooliganism,"" the musician was sentenced to two years in a penal colony. With less than six months left on her sentence, she began a hunger strike on September 23, declaring the conditions at the Mordovia prison to be intolerable.

"London (CNN) -- The British government has rejected requests to hold a public inquiry into the 2006 death of former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko, a spokesman for the coroner's inquest said Friday. Litvinenko's widow has been pressing for a public inquiry in addition to a basic inquest -- a coroner-led investigation that is held as a matter of course in the case of unnatural deaths in England, where Litvinenko died after being poisoned. UK officials will apprise Coroner Sir Robert Owen in writing early next week of why the public inquiry was rejected, according to a transcript of a hearing held Friday in the matter. A public inquiry, unlike an inquest, can receive evidence behind closed doors. In Litvinenko's case, such evidence could involve matters of national security, and his widow, Marina Litvinenko, had argued that a public inquiry would enable the fullest possible investigation. In a deathbed statement, Alexander Litvinenko blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin for his poisoning, an accusation the Kremlin has strongly denied. Putin foe, exiled Russian oligarch found dead in UK home . Marina Litvinenko told CNN on Friday that ""everybody is down, because we didn't expect this."" She said that with the coroner's backing, she pressed for the public inquiry ""when we realized that the coroner isn't able to prove the Russian state's involvement in what happened."" She called for a judicial review of the government's decision. ""I believe that we will find the truth, because I believe that British law can work,"" she said. Litvinenko, a former KGB agent and fierce critic of Putin, came to Britain in 2000 after turning whistle-blower on the FSB, the KGB's successor. He died at a London hospital on November 23, 2006, after being poisoned by the radioactive material polonium-210 while drinking tea at the Millennium Hotel in London's Grosvenor Square.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama's record on foreign policy has changed dramatically since taking office -- he now has one. What was arguably candidate Barack Obama's biggest weakness in 2008 may become President Obama's biggest strength with the announcement of an interim deal with Iran to slow that country's nuclear program. Since taking office in 2009, the President can boast successes including ending the war in Iraq, winding down the war in Afghanistan and killing al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. But unlike the other events, the Iran deal brings a tremendous amount of risk that could yield high reward or total catastrophe: It could end in either a more peaceful world or a nuclear Iran. State of play . The President has had a rough go of it in the past two months, largely due to the disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov. The latest CNN/ORC poll, which was released last week, has his approval rating at 41% -- the lowest of his presidency. However, the same poll found that 56% of Americans said they would favor the kind of interim deal with Iran that was reached Saturday. 20 questions about the Iran nuclear deal: What it says, what's at stake, what's next . Republican strategist Alex Castellanos said on CNN's State of the Union Sunday that the deal could help the President's public perception. ""Any time you see the President on the world stage, captain of the ship of state, you see him as the father figure for the country,"" Castellanos said. ""That's a good thing for the President politically."" Domestic impact . But that picture could get clouded if he doesn't have the support of Congress. Lawmakers from both parties urge caution on Iran deal . The deal between Iran and the six negotiating nations -- the United Kingdom, the United States, France, China, Russia and Germany -- has been met with staunch opposition, even from members of Obama's own party. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, an important Democratic voice on Iran, said the deal disproportionately favors the Islamic republic, and he predicted bipartisan support in Congress for new sanctions. ""This disproportionality of this agreement makes it more likely that Democrats and Republicans will join together and pass additional sanctions when we return in December. I intend to discuss that possibility with my colleagues,"" the senator from New York said. And on State of the Union, Rep. Eliot Engel, D-New York, said the deal makes it ""very difficult"" to continue sanctions that are considered effective at hobbling Iran's nuclear capabilities. Congress could choose to try to circumvent the deal and impose new sanctions on Iran, starting another battle between the President and the Congress. Such an action would be a huge embarrassment for Obama internationally if Congress successfully undermines him. ""Weakness invites the wolves,"" Castellanos said. ""When you are in a weak position politically as leader of the United States ... you're a little more open to things you shouldn't be open to."" With trust between the executive and legislative branches extremely low, the Iran deal could drive a bigger wedge between the two sides. International impact . Also at stake is the United States' relationship with its allies in the Middle East. On Sunday, Israel and Saudi Arabia slammed the deal, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu calling it a ""historic mistake."" Iran nuclear deal: One agreement, wildly different reactions . ""They're afraid this deal is the start between the United States and Iran that will take us off Saudi Arabia's side and put us on Iran's side,"" Ken Pollack of the Brookings Institution said on CNN's Fareed Zakaria GPS. While allies worry that the deal might weaken their relationship with the United States or put their security at risk, CNN's Zakaria said the alternative could be worse. ""Had the Geneva talks broken down this week, Iran would have continued to expand its nuclear program,"" he said, adding that Iran has increased the number of centrifuges from 160 to 19,000 in the past decade. Russia and China, two countries that have tenuous relationships with the United States and have closer ties to Iran, support the deal. Retreat or redefine? While he has received bipartisan praise for some of his foreign policy initiatives, Obama has been criticized by opponents for acquiescing American leadership. Castellanos said some might look at this deal as another example of the President ""retreating from the world."" ""It's our presence and strength that keeps the world peaceful,"" he said. ""As we approach a more global kind of perspective, we're just one of many countries that is working to make the world a better place, the world is more uncertain."" His supporters, however, have praised his foreign policy philosophy. Bill Burton, a former adviser and deputy press secretary for Obama, said the deal shows ""a significant shift in American foreign policy"" that includes consensus-building and diplomatic engagement. While the interim deal is only the first stage of multistep negotiations that could unravel at any time, only time will tell how it will be remembered by future historians examining Obama's legacy.

"(CNN) -- It is one of the most iconic ports in the world, the dramatic backdrop to everything from ancient Roman sailing ships to World War Two military vessels and gas-guzzling speedboats. Now London's historic River Thames has played host to a new generation of boat -- one which could revolutionize not just the future of nautical design, but scientific research on the high seas. Introducing MS Turanor Planet Solar -- the world's largest solar-powered boat. Sunny disposition . Resembling more ""Starship Enterprise"" than a modern catamaran, the 35-meter vessel arrived in the British capital last week -- its last stop on a scientific expedition across the Atlantic. Featuring an expandable deck covered in over 500 square meters of solar panels, the 60-ton vessel is completely powered by the sun. More than 800 solar panels charge enormous lithium-ion batteries stowed in the catamaran's twin hulls, which power two electric motors at the back. ""On a full battery we can run for 72 hours without sun,"" says captain Gerard d'Aboville, who is also the first man to row solo across the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans. ""I receive meteorological forecasts for the next week, which update on our map every hour, so I can see the sunniest route to take."" Eco expedition . The $16 million vessel cut an impressive figure as it cruised beneath London's raised Tower Bridge, marking the end of an almost three-month scientific expedition along the Atlantic's warm Gulf Stream. Heading off from Miami in June, the boat's team of scientists examined water and air samples, as part of their research into climate change. Led by University of Geneva climatologist Martin Beniston -- a member of a United Nations-backed panel on climate change that won the 2007 Nobel peace prize -- they used high-tech ""vacuum cleaners"" to measure aerosols (fine particles in the air) and winches which plunged 200 meters below the water. Watch: Stunning time-lapse of Antarctic science mission . ""The fact that the boat doesn't create any pollutants means what we measure is as natural as possible,"" said Beniston. ""And in terms of awareness-raising, we're carrying out the research in a boat which could be connected to the future and reducing our carbon footprint."" Record breaking design . It's not the first time the high-tech vessel has made headlines around the world. In May last year it also became the first solar-powered vessel to circumnavigate the globe, traveling at an average speed of five knots. It continued to break the record books earlier this year when it made the fastest solar-powered crossing of the Atlantic -- traveling from Spain to the West Indies in 22 days and breaking its own previous record by four days. See: High-tech yacht aiming to smash speed record . The brainchild of Swiss eco-adventurer Raphael Domjan, the high-tech boat was designed by New Zealand nautical architecture company LOMOcean Design, and built by German shipyard Knierim Yachtbau in 2010. And with room for up to 60 people, you're more likely to see the unusual boat before you hear it. Unlike other diesel-powered ships, MS Turanor Planet Solar glides silently across the water. ""The boat has a very special look, with her expandable deck,"" said d'Aboville. ""In fact, we were two miles off the coast of Monaco when some people called the police to say there was an airplane on the water."" Old name, new look . But for such a futuristic-looking vessel, MS Turanor Planet Solar has an ancient-sounding name. ""Turanor"" was named after the word for ""power of the sun"" in J.R.R Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. It may also prove to be the beginnings of an epic adventure -- this time on the high seas.","World's largest solar-powered yacht cruises beneath Tower Bridge .

"(CNN) -- Octuplets mom Nadya Suleman pleaded not guilty Friday to welfare fraud charges relating to allegations that she did not report money that she earned as a topless dancer and adult film actress, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office. Suleman's next court date is February 3. On Monday, Los Angeles District Attorney Jackie Lacey said that while Suleman applied for public aid, the mother of 14 children ""allegedly failed to disclose that she was also getting checks for personal appearances and residuals from videos."" Suleman -- known in tabloids as ""Octomom"" -- was not arrested, but was ordered to appear before an Los Angeles County judge for her initial arraignment, the DA said Monday. She was not taken into custody Friday . The charges of one count of aid by misrepresentation and two counts of perjury by false application for aid accuse Suleman of not reporting nearly $30,000 in earnings. From June: Suleman books stripper gigs to save home . Her work was no secret, though. Suleman, 38, performed in adult videos and danced topless at a Florida strip club last year. ""This is not a new career for her,"" her rep, Gina Rodriguez, told CNN in June when asked about her stripping gig. ""She is just promoting her new video."" An adult video featuring Suleman was released in June. Suleman revealed in April that she was so determined to build a future for her 14 young children that she would accept adult entertainment offers, although she would not touch another ""human's flesh."" Suleman, who collected food stamps to feed her 14 young children, filed for bankruptcy in May, but the case was tossed out of court because of paperwork issues. Suleman dreams of building a business ""empire"" that will pay for food, shelter and college educations for her 14 children, she told Turner. She ultimately hopes to become a role model for other women facing major struggles, she said. ""I've got to win the battle,"" she said. ""But right now, people don't understand that."" The criminal complaint, filed by Deputy District Attorney William Clark with the public assistance fraud division, said Suleman applied for public assistance in Lancaster, California, in January 2013. It alleges that she failed to report the extra income earned between in the first six months of last year. Suleman faces up to five years, eight months in prison if convicted, the prosecutor said. CNN's Rosalina Nieves contributed to this report.","The mother of 14 is accused of taking welfare money while earning cash as a stripper .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A former Los Angeles school district teacher pleaded no contest Friday to 23 felony counts of lewd acts on 23 children and was immediately sentenced to 25 years in prison, the district attorney's office said. Mark Berndt, 62, who taught at Miramonte Elementary School for more than 30 years, was accused of putting pupils in bondage and then photographing them with semen-filled spoons held at their mouths and 3-inch cockroaches crawling across their faces. The incidents occurred between 2005 and 2010. The sexual molestation victims were 22 girls and one boy between the ages of 7 and 10, prosecutors said. Several tearful mothers of the victims attended Friday's emotional hearing. Berndt's attorney, Manny Medrano, said his client could be released after serving 19Â½ years of the 25-year sentence. Berndt was arrested in 2012. Appearing gaunt, Berndt entered the courtroom in an orange jail jumpsuit, handcuffed and chained at the waist. He responded directly to the judge and never turned around to face the gallery. Parents wept when Berndt walked into the courtroom. His attorney, however, did turn to the gallery when speaking in court and said Berndt was profoundly sorry and remorseful for the pain and discomfort he caused. In statements to the courts, the mothers told the judge that their daughters can never eat cookies again. Mothers earlier alleged that Berndt also gave their daughters cookies with a white substance on them. Last year, in an interview with CNN, the mother of a female student said her daughter went to Berndt's classroom, where ""he would give her some cookies. My daughter told me that the teacher would say the cookies had sugar and some white stuff that was on it,"" the mother said. ""He deserves to be punished,"" one mother said in her statement to the court. ""Back in the day, you burned them in wood."" Responded Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge George G. Lomeli: ""I don't have the power to do that nor would I."" In one written statement that was read aloud by a court employee, one mother of a victim defended Berndt as a ""good man"" and a ""good teacher."" In September, the Los Angeles Unifed School District announced it paid almost $27.3 million to settle 58 of 191 students' lawsuits alleging they were victims of sexually lewd acts by Berndt. Meanwhile, two other lawsuits in the Miramonte case have been settled but are pending court approval. The almost $27.3 million in payments works out to about $470,000 per child, according to the district. On Friday, Superintendent John Deasy said the district wasn't a party to the ""plea deal."" ""We are relieved that the students and families will be able to put this part of the proceedings behind them,"" Deasy said in a statement. ""We hope that we can reach a resolution with the students and families who have yet to settle in an expeditious and respectful manner that will allow them to continue to heal and move forward.""

"(EW.com) -- Bilbo Baggins went after treasure this weekend, and he found a lot of it — just not quite as much as he did last year. Peter Jackson's latest Middle-earth adventure The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug earned $73.6 million in its opening weekend, marking a 13 percent drop from The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey's $84.6 million bow in December 2012. Smaug notched the fourth-best December opening weekend ever, after An Unexpected Journey, I Am Legend ($77.2 million), and Avatar ($77 million), and although it undercut its predecessor's debut, Warner Bros., who co-financed the film with MGM for about $225 million, can't be too disappointed with the result. The first Hobbit film finished with $303 million domestically and over $1 billion worldwide. Even if Smaug can't match those figures (if it plays like Journey, it's headed for $263 million domestically), it will be a hugely profitable venture for the studio. In order to differentiate it from the first Hobbit, Warner Bros. marketed The Desolation of Smaug by focusing heavily on Evangeline Lilly's elvish character, Tauriel, who didn't appear in J.R.R. Tolkien's novel, as well as Orlando Bloom's Legolas, who returned for the prequels, and Benedict Cumberbatch as the voice of Smaug. Still, audiences, which were 60 percent male and 64 percent above the age of 25, weren't all convinced to give the series a second try after being turned off by the more juvenile An Unexpected Journey. The film pulled in 49 percent of its weekend gross from 3-D ticket sales, and IMAX screens made up $9.2 million of its haul. Crowds issued Smaug an ""A--"" CinemaScore grade. In second place, Disney's animated musical Frozen didn't melt despite the heat of dragon's breath. The film fell only 30 percent to $22.2 million in its third weekend, giving it a remarkable $164.4 million — already more than its $150 million budget. At the same point in its run, Tangled had earned $115 million en route to a $200 million finish — and that film is a perfect comparison since it also opened wide over Thanksgiving weekend. If Frozen maintains its current pace, it will hit $285 million domestically. With no new family films on the horizon, it will be the top family choice over the upcoming holiday break. Tyler Perry's A Madea Christmas unwrapped only $16.2 million this weekend, marking the lowest-ever start for one of Perry's popular Madea films — and the second-lowest start ever for Perry as a director after 2007′s Daddy's Little Girls, which opened with $11.2 million. The last Madea entry, 2012′s Madea's Witness Protection, opened to $25.1 million, but Christmas, which cost Lionsgate about $25 million to produce, fell far short of that number. What makes that performance particularly shocking is that advance ticket sales were booming. If there's a silver lining, it's that, unlike the rest of the front-loaded Madea films, Christmas has the potential to hold up nicely in the two weeks leading up to the actual holiday. Audiences gave the picture an ""A--"" CinemaScore. Two blockbuster sequels rounded out the top five. The Hunger Games: Catching Fire dropped 50 percent in its fourth weekend to $13.2 million, giving it a scorching $357 million total — and all against a sensible (for a movie of this scale) $130 million budget. It took the first Hunger Games five weeks to reach the same total on the way to a $408 million domestic finish, so Catching Fire still seems poised to break the $400 million mark. One rung lower, Thor: The Dark World grossed $2.7 million in its sixth frame and has now amassed $198.1 million. It will eke past the $200 million mark soon, and while that's no gross to shake a hammer at, it's slightly disappointing considering the original Thor earned $181 million and Disney was no doubt hoping for more than an 11 percent boost following The Avengers' run — especially given the fact that Iron Man 3 earned 31 percent more than Iron Man 2 ($409 million vs. $312 million) earlier this year. 1. The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug -- $73.6 million . 2. Frozen -- $22.2 million . 3. A Madea Christmas -- $16.2 million . 4. The Hunger Games: Catching Fire -- $13.2 million . 5. Thor: The Dark World -- $2.7 million . In limited release, American Hustle proved its mettle with an eye-popping $115,000 per theater average — the second best of the year after Frozen's $243,390 premiere weekend in one theater. Hustle, which was directed by David O. Russell and stars Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper, Amy Adams, and Jennifer Lawrence, grossed $690,000 from only six theaters, and now appears ready to thrive when Sony pushes it into 2,500 locations next weekend. It certainly outshined Disney's Mary Poppins tale Saving Mr. Banks, which took in $421,000 in 15 theaters for a still solid $28,067 location average. The Tom Hanks/Emma Thompson vehicle expands to about 2,200 theaters next week. See the original story at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- Results for Republican candidates in the most high-profile 2013 races this year -- a resounding re-election win by Gov. Chris Christie in New Jersey and losses for Virginia governor and New York mayor -- stand as a reminder to party leaders that the civil war in their ranks remains a toxic turnoff to voters. A pattern has emerged: GOP candidates who wade into the hottest ideological fights -- such as the government shutdown or the attempt to defund Obamacare -- enjoy a burst of publicity and cheers from right-wing think tanks, conservative donors and media celebrities. But the same rowdy, combative style that delights audiences at tea party rallies tarnishes the party label among independent voters. That makes life politically difficult for middle-of-the-road Republicans. The pattern was on display in the recent races for governor. In Virginia, the GOP candidate, Ken Cuccinelli, narrowly lost a winnable race in no small part due to his longstanding affiliation with the tea party and with attempts to crack down on immigration and drastically limit the availability of abortions. In a showdown against Terry McAuliffe -- a former Democratic National Committee chairman with close ties to corporate leaders and ex-President Bill Clinton -- Cuccinelli tried to mute or distance himself from past stances on divisive social issues, but the damage was done. Women, blacks, Latinos, young voters and government workers -- the same coalition that twice delivered Virginia to Barack Obama -- were highly motivated to block Cuccinelli, who closed out the campaign accompanied by tea party heroes such as radio show host Mark Levin and Sen. Rand Paul. McAuliffe, by contrast, toured with Clinton and used his corporate ties to raise $14 million more than Cuccinelli. Exit polls showed Cuccinelli lost women, blacks and voters under 44. And finally, when totals rolled in from Fairfax County -- home to thousands of federal workers who weren't thrilled by the Republican-led government shutdown -- McAuliffe pulled ahead and won. On the same day, Republican Christie showed how a different path could lead to victory. Eschewing hard-line stances on the government shutdown or immigration reform, he reached out to New Jersey's independents, who outnumber Republicans or Democrats in the Garden State. Christie, who automatically becomes a Republican presidential contender, romped to a victory of historic proportions with a majority of women voters, half the state's Latino voters and 21% of black voters -- groups that are usually reliable parts of the Democratic base. In the hours before his victory, Christie explained to CNN's Jake Tapper why his efforts should be a model for Republicans. ""I think the party cares more about winning the argument than winning the election, and if you don't win elections, you can't govern,"" he said in words that should be plastered on the door of every state Republican headquarters. The battle between Republican factions is deep-seated: Sociologist Robert Putnam tellingly described it as a fight between country-club and Sunday school Republicans. The country clubbers, according to Putnam, are mainstream party members concerned about business development and low taxes, while the Sunday schoolers care passionately about social issues such as abortion. The glue that long held the coalition together -- common opposition to abortion and homosexuality -- has weakened in recent years. A number of Republicans -- looking at polling and voter data -- have become supporters of same-sex marriage and abortion rights. Thoughtful young conservatives such as Ryan Sager and Margaret Hoover have been pointing out for years that the party's future requires moderating its thinking on same-sex marriage and abortion to keep the party relevant to young, live-and-let-live libertarian Republicans. Now a more aggressive response is coming from a Republican group, Main Street Advocacy, that is running ads attacking ultra-conservatives who keep losing elections -- and backing moderate Republicans against them. ""We want our party back,"" says the group's founder, former U.S. Rep. Steven LaTourette of Ohio, who left the House after complaining about the polarizing elements in the GOP. It remains unclear who will win the Republican civil war; not everyone has drawn the same conclusions from this week's elections. Brent Bozell, for example, a nationally respected conservative who runs ForAmerica, an activist group, says the problem in Virginia is that the candidate and party weren't conservative enough. ""The moderate branch of the Republican Party turned its back on Cuccinelli, and that hurt him big time,"" he told the Atlantic. ""Politics is solidifying and mobilizing your base -- and the hell with the middle."" That attitude among many national Republicans -- the hell with the middle -- helped doom the chances of New York mayoral candidate Joe Lhota. As the former deputy mayor under Rudy Giuliani, Lhota tried to run a candidacy similar to Guiliani's -- moderate or liberal on social issues while tough on crime and fiscally conservative. Lhota, in fact, opposed the government shutdown and is pro-same-sex marriage and pro-abortion rights. But voters never heard that message: At every turn, Lhota's Democratic rival, Bill de Blasio, simply associated him with tea party Republicans. In one of their final debates, Lhota turned to de Blasio in exasperation. ""Where I don't agree with the national Republican Party is long and hard,"" he said. ""Do not lump me with the national Republicans. It's unbecoming."" The Republican civil war, decades in the making, will come to a head in the next 36 months, as we begin the run-up to the next presidential election. Expect Christie and other moderate candidates to point to Virginia, New York and other losses as missed opportunities -- the price for choosing to win arguments instead of elections. And expect the tea party to respond that pursuing politics without principles is no way to lead a country.

"(CNN) -- As mobile devices get increasingly slimmer, so too will their corresponding USB connectors. Even better, you won't have to flip the cable when you try to slip it in upside down. Finally. Development for the next-generation USB connector, called the Type-C, is underway and will be thinner and sleeker than current USB 3.0 cables (pictured above), according to the USB 3.1 Promoter Group, which is made up of industry heavy hitters including Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard and Intel. SEE ALSO: 25 Best Free Android Apps . To pack the powerful punch of the USB 3.1 standard, which can move data at 10 gigabits per second, into a smaller cable, it will closely resemble the USB 2.0 Micro-B. But it has a few advantages over existing models: Specifically, it's reversible, meaning users no longer need to worry about plug orientation. The plug design is similar to Apple's Lightning cables and will take away one of USB's main frustrations. The downside is that the new cables won't work with existing connectors. The Type-C connector is built on existing USB 3.1 and USB 2.0 technologies and will have scalable power capabilities, meaning it will be able to charge a wide range of gadgets. ""While USB technology is well established as the favored choice for connecting and powering devices, we recognize the need to develop a new connector to meet evolving design trends in terms of size and usability,"" said Brad Saunders, USB 3.0 Promoter Group Chairman, in a statement. ""The new Type-C connector will fit well with the market's direction and affords an opportunity to lay a foundation for future versions of USB."" The organization said the Type-C connector will be completed by mid-2014. See the original story on Mashable. © 2013 MASHABLE.com.

"Beijing (CNN) -- Xu Zhiyong, a high-profile Chinese activist accused of organizing protests against official corruption, has been convicted and sentenced to four years in prison, a Beijing court announced Sunday. The U.S. State Department immediately released a statement saying the sentence was ""retribution for his public campaign to expose corruption."" Chinese prosecutors alleged that Xu Zhiyong ""gathered a crowd to disturb public order"" after a series of small protests. The demonstrators unfurled banners in Beijing calling for officials to publicly declare their assets, said Xu's lawyer, Zhang Qingfang. Zhang told CNN before Sunday's announcement from Beijing No. 1 Intermediate People's Court that they expected a guilty verdict and heavy sentence because of the case's political nature. He said they would ""definitely appeal."" The trial of Xu -- who founded the New Citizens Movement, which calls for official transparency and rule of law -- attracted widespread attention and authorities have come down hard on international media covering the case. A CNN crew recently was prevented from approaching and filming the courthouse. CNN's Beijing correspondent, David McKenzie, was kicked, pushed and punched by Chinese security before being forced into a nearby van and driven away. Roseann Rife, an official with rights group Amnesty International, called the verdict ""shameful, but sadly predictable."" ""The Chinese authorities have once again opted for the rule of fear over the rule of law,"" Rife said in a statement. ""At best, the injustice of prosecuting Xu Zhiyong is hypocrisy of the highest order."" Lawyer: Xu removed from court . A former law lecturer at the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Xu has a reputation for taking on groundbreaking legal causes. He has campaigned for death row inmates and families effected by a poisoned milk formula scandal in 2009. On July 16, Xu was arrested after spending more than three months under house arrest at his Beijing home. During his trial, Xu tried to read a prepared statement highlighting the goals of the movement and declaring his innocence but was interrupted by the judge when he spoke about wanting top leaders to be transparent about their assets, his lawyer said. ""Calling on officials to reveal their assets was our effort to promote the country's anti-graft system,"" Xu said, according to his lawyer. ""More than 137 countries and regions in the world have established such systems, why can't China? What are those 'people's servants' afraid of?"" Authorities removed Xu from the courtroom after he made those remarks, his lawyer said. Xu's name, 'constitutional rule' blocked on search engines . Well before last week's trial, Xu had become an international figure as activists and others demanded his release. Outgoing U.S. Ambassador to China Gary Locke issued a statement saying he was ""deeply concerned that ... the prosecution of (Xu and) other good-governance advocates advocates are retribution for their public campaigns to expose official corruption and for the peaceful expression of their views."" Searches for Xu's name and ""constitutional rule"" were blocked on Chinese microblogs and search engines around the time of his trial. It began amid new and potentially embarrassing revelations about the wealth of China's elite. The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists reported that close relatives of China's top leaders own offshore companies in international tax havens. The report said that confidential files showed that President Xi Jinping's brother-in-law and the son of former Premier Wen Jiabao had set up companies in the British Virgin Islands. While not illegal, the findings shed light on the wealth of the country's leaders at a time when President Xi is intensifying his campaign against high-level corruption, the report said. CNN's Katie Hunt and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","NEW: Sentence is ""retribution,"" the State Dept. says .

"(CNN) -- Turns out that Bruce Springsteen's scribblings were worth more than the auctioneers imagined. An anonymous $197,000 bid won Thursday's auction for handwritten lyrics to Springsteen's 1975 hit song ""Born to Run."" The purchase was part of a ""Fine Books and Manuscripts including Americana"" auction at Sotheby's auction house in New York. The starting bid was $40,000, and Sotheby's had expected the manuscript, which features 30 lines and marginal notations scrawled in blue ink, to fetch between $70,000 and $100,000. ""Born to Run"" reached only No. 23 on the Billboard Hot 100, but it aged well, earning the No. 21 spot on Rolling Stone magazine's list of all-time greatest songs and being named among the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 songs that shaped the genre. Springsteen explained the song's birth in a statement issued by Sotheby's. He wrote the lyrics in his Long Branch, New Jersey, home in early 1974, after releasing two albums that gave him little commercial success. ""One day I was playing my guitar on the edge of the bed, working on some song ideas, and the words 'born to run' came to me,"" Springsteen said. ""At first I thought it was the name of a movie or something I'd seen on a car spinning around the circuit. I liked the phrase because it suggested a cinematic drama that I thought would work with the music that I'd been hearing in my head."" The 1975 track became Springsteen's first worldwide release. Sotheby's said that although many of the original lyrics never made it to the recording booth, the chorus was ""nearly perfected"" in the handwritten manuscript. CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin and Luisa Navarro contributed to this report.","Sotheby's auction house had anticipated final bid between $70K and $100K .

"(CNN) -- The United States has ""deep concerns"" over China's newly declared East China Sea air defense zone, Vice President Joe Biden privately told Chinese President Xi Jinping during his visit to Beijing on Wednesday, according to a pool report citing senior administration officials traveling with the delegation. According to the pool account of a background briefing by the officials, Biden also told Xi that the United States doesn't recognize the zone -- which includes uninhabited islands that have been the site of tense disputes between China and Japan, both of which claim the lands for their own. ""President Xi was equally clear in laying out their view of the zone and of territorials disputes in the region,"" one of the officials said, according to the pool report. ""Ultimately, President Xi took on board what the vice president said. It's up to China, and we'll see how things will unfold in the coming days and weeks."" Biden had assured Japanese leaders on Tuesday that he would raise the issue with Xi, but it was not mentioned publicly by either leader. In public remarks welcoming Biden that betrayed no hint of the tensions, Xi called the former senator an ""old friend"" and praised U.S.-China relations. ""We're happy to see that in the recent period, our two teams have worked actively to expand coordination and collaboration on bilateral, regional, and global levels,"" President Xi said in greeting Biden on his latest visit to China, according to a pool report. Biden also made no public mention of the controversial Chinese air defense space declaration, instead focusing on the possibilities of good relations between the two nations. He cited discussions between Xi and President Barack Obama this summer seeking a ""new model"" in relations between the countries as China seeks to expand its influence worldwide and as the U.S. pivots its attention from the Middle East to Asia. ""As we've discussed in the past, this new model of major-country cooperation ultimately has to be based on trust, and a positive notion about the motive of one another,"" Biden said. ""The relationship that you and President Obama have established thus far is full of promise, and real opportunity for us,"" Biden told Xi, according to a pool report. ""If we get this relationship right with a genuine new model, the possibilities are limitless,"" he said. Asia trip gives Biden chance to show off diplomatic cred . But in a sign the two leaders had much to talk about privately, a scheduled 45-minute private session between Xi and Biden ran two hours. The meeting covered ""every single topic in the U.S.-China relationship,"" including economic issues and North Korea, said one of the U.S. officials who were briefing reporters . ""They talked at some length about what the Iran example means for North Korea,"" the official said, referring to the recently reached deal between Iran and a coalition of international powers to curb the Middle Eastern nation's nuclear program. The official was referring to how the international community came together to pressure Iran to reach a deal, according to the pool report. Biden's visit to China comes about two weeks after China declared an air defense zone over a portion of the East China Sea, including island territories that China and Japan each claim. The dispute over the islands has led to tense situations between ships and planes from the two countries over the past year, raising concerns that an incident in China's newly declared defense zone could spiral out of control. It has also fueled concern among U.S. officials about how far China is willing to go to pursue its interests in the Asia-Pacific region and push back against U.S. influence. China is asking aircraft entering its air defense zone to identify themselves and submit flight plans. It says the zone is similar to others maintained by nations around the world, saying that it is not asserting territorial control over the airspace and that legitimate commercial traffic will continue to move through the region unhindered. China's declaration prompted pushback from the United States and other nations in the region, which rejected the zone and continued to route military flights through the area. Japan has told its commercial airlines not to comply with the new Chinese demands, but the U.S. government has urged American carriers to follow Beijing's instructions. On Tuesday, Biden assured Japanese leaders that he would press China over the issue. ""We, the United States, are deeply concerned by the attempt to unilaterally change the status quo in the East China Sea,"" Biden said at a news conference alongside Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Tuesday. ""I will be raising these concerns with great specificity directly when I meet with the Chinese leadership,"" Biden said. Biden promises to press China on airspace dispute . U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki reiterated this week that Washington does not recognize the air defense zone or China's demand to be notified of plans by jets from other nations to fly into the area. The Chinese action, Biden said, raises the possibility of ""accidents and miscalculation."" In a statement Tuesday, a spokesman for China's Defense Ministry said the zone is one of ""safety, not risks, a zone of cooperation, not competition."" Without naming the United States, spokesman Geng Yansheng, warned countries about becoming involved in China's dispute with Japan. ""Other parties concerned should also mind their words and actions, and should not do things to undermine regional stability and bilateral relations,"" he said. ""Other parties should not be incited, or send wrong signals to make a very few countries go further on the wrong track, which will follow the same old disastrous road and undermine regional and world peace.""

"(CNN) -- Justin Bieber's defense team now includes Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande. Both singers stood up for the 19-year-old pop star as he was being hammered on Twitter and TV after his DUI arrest Thursday, encouraging their fans to show some compassion and support. ""Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and to stand up for themselves, but I think we should be supportive of Beliebers,"" Gaga told her Little Monsters -- aka her fans -- in a post on her website Thursday. ""We may not understand everything celebrities do because there's only so much we see, but Justin and Beliebers were 'born this way' too. Let's spread love and compassion to Beliebers today. That is what we are all about."" Ellen DeGeneres, who once had Bieber on her show to surprise him with a car as a birthday gift, sounded genuine when she tweeted she hopes the star will be able to mature without injury. Nickelodeon star Grande, who spent some time on tour with Bieber and shares a manager with the pop star, Scooter Braun, didn't directly address Bieber by name, but the timing of her reaction on Twitter spoke volumes. Meanwhile, other stars such as Seth Rogen and Jason Biggs had decidedly less kind reactions to the news that Bieber had been pulled over while drag racing in Miami Beach, Florida, and then arrested on charges of drunken driving, resisting arrest and driving without a valid license. ""All jokes aside, Justin Bieber is a piece of s***,"" Rogen tweeted. Biggs joked, ""50 in a 30. Jesus, Bieber even drag races like a p****."" ""Supernatural"" actor Jared Padalecki said, ""Just saw the mugshot of @justinbieber. I gotta admit, she's kinda hot without all of her usual makeup on."" Over on late night, Bieber was the top joke on both ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" and ""Late Night With Jimmy Fallon."" Kimmel poked fun at Bieber's transformation from teeny-bopper to apparent troublemaker. He also joked about the outcry from distraught Beliebers who were depressed that criminals in Florida got to meet their idol before they did. On ""Late Night,"" Fallon skewered Bieber's mug shot, saying that he mistook it for a commercial for Proactiv, an acne treatment product. But according to Bieber's manager, Braun, and his friend Lil Za, the singer's arrest is no laughing matter. ""He's fine,"" Lil Za posted Thursday afternoon. ""Nobody's happy. nobody thinks it's a joke."" ""Been a long day. Bottom line is we are defined by how we handle adversity. Be there when it counts. Love fully in good times and bad,"" Braun added. ""(Bieber) love you and i will act in the manner of someone who truly cares. that is all I have to say. thanks for all those concerned.""

"(CNN) -- The failure of the P5+1 (the United States, United Kingdom, France, China, Russia plus Germany) to reach agreement with Iran Saturday in Geneva is a good thing if it allows the United States and Israel to sort out what really divides them on the Iranian nuclear issue before negotiations resume in coming days. That the French -- not the United States -- seem to have taken the lead in stiffening the allies' demands with Iran is in itself a reflection of those differences. And while a high-ranking U.S. delegation headed to Israel Sunday to brief the Israelis on the talks, bridging the gap there won't be that easy. Where you stand in life has a great deal to do with where you sit. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's fierce reaction to the effort to reach an interim agreement reflects the realities of a small power with much less room to maneuver on a critical security issue than a great one. And it reveals the sensitivities of an Israeli leader who's far more invested politically in seeing a nuke-free Iran, far more suspicious of Iranian motives and far more worried about the consequences of a bad deal for Israel than a U.S. President who's concerned more about what happens if there's no deal and Israel or the United States slides toward military confrontation with the mullahs who rule Iran. That gap between the United States and Israel is real. And it should neither be trivialized nor exaggerated. But short of a final deal in which Iran abandons its nuclear ambitions, it may not be bridgeable. These two allies will need to manage it as best they can. And here's why. Big and Small Powers . With non-predatory neighbors to its north and south and fish to its east and west, the United States enjoys a level of physical security unprecedented in the history of great and small powers. That gives America a margin for error that the small power simply cannot afford. Indeed, Americans have a hard time internalizing what it's like to be a small nation living on the knife's edge, whose tiny physical size, isolation and sense of vulnerability exists alongside its power and strength. I don't think Iran wants nuclear weapons to launch a first strike against Israel. But it's impossible to ignore, let alone trivialize, Israeli security concerns and vulnerabilities in this regard, particularly in the face of Iran's rhetoric, regional ambitions and support for terrorism over the years. Israel isn't some hapless victim, a piece of driftwood bobbing about on a turbulent sea; it's a dynamic nation (and a nuclear weapons state) with great military power with the capacity if need be to deal with Iran too. But that doesn't take away from the reality that it's a small country living in a dangerous neighborhood. Netanyahu's World View . All Israeli Prime Ministers are said to sleep with one eye open. Benjamin Netanyahu sleeps with two eyes open. No Israeli Prime Minister can afford to take Israel's security for granted. And none does. But ever since I've known him, the key to understanding this Prime Minister is that he's immersed in the proposition that Israel's very survival can't be taken for granted either. All Israeli leaders function in a high threat environment. But in Netanyahu's case, it defines his world and creates an us-against-them sensibility that extends to Israel's adversaries and its friends too. He has been deeply suspicious of American motives for many years and believes the United States doesn't understand the Arabs or Israel's security predicament. You live in Chevy Chase, he's said to me on more than one occasion; we live in a dangerous neighborhood with little margin for error. I never argued with him. What was the point? Unlike Israel, there is no existential threat to the United States from any external enemy largely because of where we are. But Israel's history has been marked by a continuous series of threats -- large and small -- by virtue of where the Israelis are. However powerful they have become, that legacy endures. And combined with the dark history of the Jewish people culminating in the Nazi genocide, it has left an enduring mark. The notion that Israelis fight the Arabs during the day and win and fight the Nazis at night and lose carries particular resonance with this Israeli Prime Minister. The late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin never used Holocaust imagery to describe the contemporary threats to Israel's security. Ehud Barak refused to use Hitler analogies when discussing Iran. Netanyahu does, repeatedly. Iran is Nazi Germany; former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is Hitler and we're in 1938 on the nuclear issue. It infuses his rhetoric and his world view. And while Rouhani has changed the tone and may be genuinely looking for an agreement, the charm offensive hasn't dulled the acuteness of Netanyahu's suspicions. Consequences of Israeli-American Tensions . This world view poses enormous challenges for a U.S. administration, partly because it's validated by Iran's own past rhetoric and actions and because Iran has tried to hide suspected military aspects of its nuclear program. Leaving an angry, aggrieved Israel in the wake of an interim deal with Iran that is judged to be a bad deal carries tremendous risk and consequence. First, the focus is now on an interim agreement -- a first step. That means that we won't know the end state for at least six months. Time is both an enemy and an ally here. The step-by-step approach creates time to test intentions. It also affords time for Iran to continue to advance aspects of its nuclear program and to develop a break-out capacity to dash for weapons. And they are going to be a rocky six months if Netanyahu concludes that the interim arrangements reached in Geneva work to Iran's advantage. Going right to the endgame would be ideal. But it's just not feasible. There's too much suspicion and mistrust. And neither Iran nor the United States are prepared for that. So there's built in U.S.-Israeli tension inherent in the structure of the talks themselves. Second, while the Prime Minister's fierce reaction to events in Geneva is driven by genuine anger and concern, it's also designed to begin to stir up opposition in Congress. And it won't take much stirring. There's zero capacity in Congress to give Iran the benefit of the doubt on anything. And Congress is already inclined to adopt the Israeli view that what's required now is more pressure on the mullahs rather than less, including additional sanctions. The idea that the Obama administration would want to place itself in a position of defending a deal with Iran that Israel and much of Congress oppose -- and appear implicitly to be defending the Iranians in the process -- defies the laws of political gravity, particularly for a much weakened president. To overcome these political downsides and go into battle mode, the administration would really have to have a compelling interim agreement that's sound and defensible. Third, the United States is measuring an agreement with Iran at this stage not against an ideal end state -- Iran capitulates and surrenders any hope of maintaining the capacity to enrich uranium, let alone make bombs. It's evaluating success in terms of what's practical and what will happen if no deal is reached, namely the slide toward the use of military force against Iran. Israelis don't want a war with Iran either; but they are much more comfortable with threatening military action and conditioned to accept the possibility that force may have to be used, even if the end state is an imperfect one and Iran sets about rebuilding a nuclear program. The key issue is putting time on the clock to delay Iran getting nukes -- preferably through diplomacy, but if necessary by force. Fourth, an already problematic Israeli-Palestinian peace process is going to get a lot more complicated. Narrowing the gaps on borders, refugees and Jerusalem was always going to be tough; but now getting Netanyahu to make decisions will be almost impossible. Israel-Palestinian peace process at risk . Whether the administration thought through the overlapping of a peace process with a nine-month timeline and a negotiation with Iran of six months now aligned to come to fruition right around the same time isn't clear. But the coincidence of the timing couldn't be worse. The odds that this Prime Minister would make decisions on historic issues with the Palestinians before there was clarity on Iran's nuclear program were always slim to none. For Netanyahu, the Palestinians are a long-term challenge; Iran is an imminent, acute problem. And a Netanyahu who believes the Americans aren't taking him seriously on Iran is certain to be withholding when it comes to the peace process. To satisfy Israeli requirements, an interim agreement would have to do at least three things: first, avoid doing anything that dismantles the sanctions regime and removes real pressure on Iran to cut the final deal; second, make it impossible for Iran to use the next six months to advance in a significant way any of the aspects of its nuclear program -- not just to freeze Iran's program but to actually set it back significantly. And finally, not to do anything with regard to sanctions that can't be reversed. All of this may not be possible. But in the next 10 days before negotiations with Iran resume, everything should be done to try to make certain that Washington and Jerusalem understand one another and to ensure that there's as much confidence and trust going forward as possible. An orchestrated good cop/bad cop routine between allies could be helpful in negotiating with Iran. A rift that signals the United States and Israel are fundamentally out of step is not. There are no happy or perfect endings here. At best, the choice is between an imperfect interim agreement that buys six months to determine whether Iran is prepared to give up its quest for a nuclear weapons capacity or no agreement and an inevitable slide toward military confrontation. As of now the United States sees the advantage of the former; Netanyahu doesn't. The United States has no stake in concluding an agreement with Iran that leaves Israel angry, aggrieved and vulnerable. So, the two sides will find a way to work this through. But for now, buckle your seat belts. We could be in for one bumpy ride.

"(CNN) -- U.S. prosecutors have filed charges against a security company, accusing it of faking completed background checks to bilk the government of millions of dollars. U.S. Investigations Services used a computer program to ""flush"" or ""dump"" background checks -- labeling them as completed, when in fact they had not carried out a quality review as required by the government contract, prosecutors allege in a complaint. The fraudulent behavior involved at least 665,000 background investigations -- about 40% of the total number the company conducted, prosecutors allege. The company received nearly $12 million in bonus payments from 2008 through 2010, which would not have been given if the U.S. Office of Personnel Management had known of USIS's actions, the complaint says. USIS is charged with three counts: false or fraudulent claims; false statements, and breach of contract. Other filings -- including by the defense -- remain sealed. A USIS spokeswoman described the ""alleged conduct referenced in the civil complaint"" as ""contrary to our values and commitment to exceptional service. These allegations relate to a small group of individuals over a specific time period and are inconsistent with the strong service record we have earned since our inception in 1996."" After the company learned of the allegations nearly two years ago, it ""acted decisively to reinforce our processes and management to ensure the quality of our work and adherence to OPM requirements."" ""We appointed a new leadership team, enhanced oversight procedures, and improved control protocols. From the outset, we have fully cooperated with the government's investigation and remain focused on delivering the highest quality service under our OPM contracts,"" the spokeswoman said. On its website, USIS describes itself as ""the leading industry provider of background investigations to the federal government, with a long-standing reputation for service, quality and timeliness.""

"(Oprah.com) -- Are you truly happy? Where you live, what you do and how much sex you have just might be the answer! The biggest complainer Oprah knows is her makeup artist Reggie Wells. After a recent ""Oprah Show,"" he agreed to take Pastor Will Bowen's complaint-free challenge. Reggie wears a purple wristband, and every time he utters a complaint, he has to change the wrist he wears it on. Oprah Winfrey and her makeup artist Reggie Wells share some laughter. How did he do? Oprah says Reggie ""complained so much that he was getting whiplash from changing [wrists]."" For some extra help in looking on the bright side, Oprah sent him to a class in ""laughing yoga."" First developed in India, Laughter Yoga is now practiced in 53 countries around the world. Reggie's instructor, Jeffrey Briar -- one of 48 certified Laughter Yoga instructors in the United States -- says Laughter Yoga's positive effects are no joke. ""Laughter relieves all the negative effects of stress,"" he says. ""It strengthens the abdominal organs and help you get those six-pack abs we're all looking for. It oxygenates the bloodstream. It releases endorphins, the body's natural painkiller."" The class starts cold, and Reggie remains cynical. ""We're going to start with nothing and laugh for no reason, and you'll feel better,"" Jeffrey says. But as they move on to more advanced moves -- like lion laughter, naughty naughty and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde -- Reggie really starts to catch the laughing bug. Reggie works up a sweat, but can he change his complaining ways? Reggie says that before his Laughter Yoga class, he was depressed. It was the Saturday before Easter, he was lonely and he doubted the class would do much to change that. ""It was very goofy in the beginning ... but you can't fake a laugh,"" he says. ""Once you get into it ... the stress lifted from my soul, it lifted from my body."" Dr. Robert Holden, author of ""Happiness Now"" says chronic complainers like Reggie actually live in fear of happiness. Their condition -- which he dubs ""happy-chondria"" -- is based on a belief that any happiness carries an eventual fall and price. ""Rather than have everything be perfect and full, I'll have it be quite good and complain,"" he says.

""It's not making me happy to sit here at this desk anymore. I cannot blame anyone else for my unhappiness. I completely believe life is short. You do not get a second chance. I was standing at an edge, and for me it was time to jump."" Liz took a 90 percent pay cut and traded the high-wire act of finance for a career as a trapeze artist! Following her dream is ""like laughter in my heart,"" she says. ""It's hard to quantify that fulfillment that comes with it, but it greatly exceeds the compensation that I sacrificed."" Dr. Holden says the key to being happy is overcoming ""destination addiction,"" which he defines as ""living in the not-now."" ""It's always about tomorrow, so you're chasing 'more,' 'next' and 'there,'"" he says. ""You promise yourself that when you get there, you'll be happy. And I promise you, you won't, because you'll always set another destination to go for."" Instead, Dr. Holden says if you are unhappy with your life or looking to improve your score on the satisfaction test, there are two things you can do. ""We have to learn to let go of our past, we have to give up all hopes for a perfect past. Let the past go, it's gone."" After that, he says, ""Take a vow of kindness. Be kinder to yourself and to others. ""It's never too late to be happy,"" he says. Can more sex make you happy? Find out what one woman did to rev up her sex life! Lawreen and Randy were the average suburban couple raising two kids. But after just two years of marriage, something was missing. ""After we had our kids, our sex life just kind of vanished. It wasn't a priority anymore, and if my husband wanted it, I thought it was up to him to initiate it,"" Lawreen says. ""The lack of sex was creating unhappiness in the rest of our life. We were snapping at each other. We weren't very patient and understanding."" After seeing an ""Oprah Show"" about how important sex was to a marriage, Lawreen realized she needed to spice things up in a big way. ""I said, 'This is what we're going to do. We're going to have sex every night. I'm not going to tell him. I'm going to get babysitters. I'm going to make a date,'"" she says. Lawreen also started dressing up, wearing more makeup, learned how to strip from DVDs and took belly dancing courses. She also took sex out of the bedroom and brought it into other places in her home. How did Randy react? ""In my mind I thought, 'I know women hit their sexual peak later,'"" he says. ""I did not question it at all."" Three years after Lawreen thought up this plan, their sex life is still going strong. Lawreen says she and Randy still have sex almost every night. ""If we don't, it's because we're extremely exhausted or Randy's away on a business trip,"" Lawreen says. ""Not because we don't want to."" In fact, having sex every night has brought Lawreen and Randy closer as a couple. ""We're better parents. We're happier people,"" Lawreen says. ""The more sex we have, the more touchy and more affectionate we are with one another. & So we're better parents and our kids. Oh, they pick up on this. They feel happy because Mom and Dad are happy."" Happiness expert Dr. Holden says Lawreen and Randy have the right idea. ""I think the big thing, guys, which I really appreciate about you, is I think you understand that sex is communication. & So there's intimacy here,"" he says. ""One of the big mistakes I think we make in relationships is that we don't give our best energy to the people that matter most. And I think what you're doing is you're making that time to be able to give some of your best energy to each other."" E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- A year ago this week, a monster tornado ripped through Joplin, Missouri, leaving 161 people dead and hundreds more injured. Miles of homes and businesses were flattened by the enormous multivortex storm, one of the worst recorded in U.S. history. Neighborhoods, schools and communities were literally blown away. A year later, Joplin is 'on the mend' In 2011, Impact Your World focused on some of the many organizations that provided immediate assistance to the area, such as emergency shelter, supplies and assistance to victims and their families. A year later, most relief efforts have ceased, but Joplin is still working to recover and rebuild. Hundreds are still homeless, and the destruction of businesses left many owners and workers without income. The city of Joplin estimates that almost 130,000 volunteers have logged hundreds of thousands of hours since the tornado, helping rebuild over the past year in what Joplinites have referred to as the ""miracle of the human spirit."" Americorps St. Louis, which matches needs with resources, has been responsible for coordinating their efforts. What's still needed . Memories of the tragedy are still fresh in the minds of Joplin residents. Lynn Onstot, the city's communications officer, says now that storm season is back, many residents are finding themselves facing fears and anxieties: ""Could such an epic storm hit us again?"" To help them cope, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has granted funds to the Missouri Department of Mental Health for crisis counseling. Although Joplin has worked fast to rebuild, many of the hundreds of businesses destroyed by the tornado have not been able to get back to full speed. The Joplin Chamber of Commerce stresses that the economic effects of a disaster like this can affect communities for years. It has created a charitable arm, the Business Recovery Fund, which raises money to help stabilize local businesses, fund building and retraining, and build a medical school. One of the biggest problems Joplin residents continue to face is housing. A year after the storm, hundreds of families are still living in FEMA trailers and are unable to rebuild their homes. Rebuild Joplin works to construct housing for people whose homes were destroyed. It seeks donations and volunteers. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon is getting involved by spearheading the Joplin Challenge in association with Habitat For Humanity. The challenge needs donations and volunteers to help build 35 homes to contribute to the city's recovery. Volunteers can also join players from seven local sports teams -- the Kansas City Chiefs and Royals; the St. Louis Rams, Cardinals and Blues; the University of Missouri Tigers; and Kansas Speedway in association with NASCAR Unites -- and build alongside their team. Onstot says that as far as long term efforts are concerned, the Joplin Recovery Fund has been instrumental. It was established by the Community Foundation of Southwest Missouri and the Community Foundation of the Ozarks. They have awarded 30 grants totaling $2.43 million since September for various causes including rebuilding Joplin, relief for tornado victims and improving disaster preparedness. They ask that donors note ""Joplin Recovery Fund"" on the fund program box online or on checks. HLN recently featured a fundraising effort by Joplin expats Todd Green and Dave DuCille. Green is the president of Joplin Expats, and DuCille is the founder of Central Park Fitness. They are cycling from New York to Joplin to raise money for 20 storm shelters for families there. You can donate to their cause and follow their journey on their website. Obama calls Joplin High graduates an 'inspiration,' urges them to lead America . Marking the anniversary . To mark the first anniversary of the disaster, Onstot says, everyone who has played a part in the city's recovery is invited to the Joplin Day of Unity. The day will include such activities as a walk along the tornado's path. The city has also developed a website that highlights other anniversary events. Joplin welcomes everyone who would like to celebrate rebuilding efforts and play a part in the city's journey back from the storm.

"(CNN) -- Holders Bayern Munich equaled the record for successive Champions League wins held by their manager Pep Guardiola's former side Barcelona as they reached the knockout stages Tuesday. Bayern eased past Czech champions Viktoria Pilsen 1-0 for a ninth straight victory and a perfect record in Group D with 12 points from four games. They were joined in the last 16 by Manchester City, who thrashed CSKA Moscow 5-2 to remain in second place in the same group with nine points. Bayern had won the home match against Pilsen 5-0, but made harder work of it on the road and had to wait until Mario Mandzukic's 62nd minute headed winner. He connected with a Philipp Lahm cross, only six minutes after coming on as substitute, helping the Bundesliga giants to maintain their remarkable winning streak in Europe's premier club competition. It was the sixth successive time Bayern have made it to the last 16, while City were making it for the first time after two previous attempts. Having beaten Norwich 7-0 in an English Premier League match at the City of Manchester Stadium Saturday, Manuel Pellegrini's team again ran riot against their Russian opponents. Sergio Aguero provided the initial impetus with an early penalty and then a delightful second before setting up Alvaro Negredo for the third. Negredo went on to complete his hat-trick in the second half, but defensive frailties saw Seydou Doumbia twice pull back goals for CSKA, the second from the penalty spot. CSKA, who were given a partial stadium ban by UEFA for racist chanting aimed at City midfielder Yaya Toure in the reverse fixture in Moscow, which the visitors won 2-1, have only a Europa League place to play for now. The thumping victory was particularly sweet for Toure. ""I think today is a special day for the club to go through to the second round for the first time,"" he told Sky Sports. City's neighbors Manchester United stayed top of Group A after a goalless draw at Real Sociedad, but had Marouaune Fellaini sent off in the second half. Robin van Persie also missed a penalty after coming on as a late substitute for United. Shakhtar Donetsk and Bayer Leverkusen shared a goalless draw in the Ukraine in the other match played in the group. In Group B, Juventus kept their qualification hopes alive as they held Real Madrid to a 2-2 draw in Turin. Juve led through Arturo Vidal's first half penalty before Cristiano Ronaldo and the world's most expensive player Gareth Bale scored fine goals to put Real ahead. Fernando Llorente scored a crucial leveler for Antonio Conte's men to deny Real for now their passage into the last 16. With FC Copenhagen's 1-0 home win over Galatasaray, Juve dropped to last in the group, but trail the Danes and the Turks by just one point with two rounds to play. Galatasaray must also next travel to Real, who are all but mathematically assured of their place in the knockout stages. Paris Saint Germain must also wait to progress from Group C and needed Zlatan Ibrahimovic's equalizer to secure a 1-1 home draw against Anderlecht. Olympiakos beat Benfica 1-0 to improve their chances of going through, moving to within three points of PSG in the standings.","Holders Bayern Munich and Manchester City qualify for knockout stages .

"(CNN) -- The immediate destruction from the typhoon are visible and palpable. But after the body bags are removed, the deceased mourned and debris cleaned, what happens next? The toll from typhoons can linger long after and is linked to disproportionate deaths of Filipino baby girls two years after a storm, according to a recent report. In comparison, male infants were not affected to the same extent. The authors posit that female infants in the Philippines suffer ""economic deaths,"" resulting from economic hardships to households and impacts on how families allocate resources. These female infant deaths is 15 times greater than typhoon exposure deaths. ""A lot of times when you think about climate change or disasters, we focus on obvious immediate damage,"" said Jesse Antilla-Hughes, assistant professor at University of San Francisco. ""When you look at the enduring legacy of the events, the lag damage is diffused, long-lasting, but serious -- it takes a long time to show up."" Long before Typhoon Haiyan, the authors, Antilla-Hughes and Solomon Hsiang, conducted research on the cost of climate change. They chose the Philippines because of the frequency of typhoons. The working paper was completed earlier this year, and is now in peer review for an economic journal. It does not examine Typhoon Haiyan, which hit the Philippines on November 8 and killed more than 4,000 people. The authors had collected economic and health data from the Philippines government spanning from 1979 to 2008 on how households were affected by typhoons. The annual average typhoon exposure deaths was 740 and their analysis found about 11,261 ""economic deaths"" of female infants in the year after the storms. ""We saw the big spike in mortality in female infants,"" said Hsiang, assistant professor of public policy at University of California Berkeley. ""What was confusing was the mortality emerged a long time after the storm."" Roughly half of the dying female infants weren't even conceived before the typhoon, so they were not even exposed in the womb. The authors found that families reduced health-related expenditures such as nutritious foods and medical visits after a typhoon. Being struck by a colossal storm can upend a household's finances. For example, a family could lose its roof, toilet and walls, the authors said. And the local economy may be devastated as it's hard for adults to recoup jobs, find income and rebuild homes. ""The storm is having an impact in the first year of life,"" Hsiang said. ""It's the fact the storm destroyed the family livelihood, they have to rebuild and get their economic foothold back. In that process, they have to cut back in what they spent."" Filipino households reduced spending by 7.1%, and the average income per household dropped by 6.6% a year after a typhoon. ""We see every sector deteriorate after the storm,"" Hsiang said. ""People working in agriculture and services, people working in construction suffer income loss. It's hard for families to get back on their feet after they've lost their ability to make more money to rebuild their lives."" Their research suggested that baby girls may inadvertently be bearing the brunt of the economic devastation as families cut back. ""We think what happens is they cut corners, try to use money to rebuild, but that's cutting back and damaging people's health particularly the most vulnerable -- most likely the infant,"" Hsiang said. But boys were not affected like girls. ""The big thing is we don't think it's active, malicious poor treatment of the girls,"" said Antilla-Hughes. ""We suspect it's something more diffuse, something subtle about family's resources in sons versus daughters."" Worse health outcomes for female children in times of economic hardships are common patterns, generally thought to occur as parents allocate less resources to girls in their household in countries like China, India and Bangladesh. But what perplexed the authors is that the Philippines is considered an egalitarian society in terms of gender. It ranked as the top performer in Asia Pacific in terms of gender equality, coming in as fifth overall in this year's World Economic Forum's report. The authors found that mortality among first-born females were moderate, but their risks doubled when the girls had older sisters, and doubled again if they had older brothers. ""We interpret these findings as strong evidence that female infant mortality is driven by resource scarcity within households and not by physical exposure to typhoons themselves,"" the authors wrote. With Typhoon Haiyan, it's difficult to determine whether the female infant mortality could be much worse the storm exposure deaths, as researchers found in previous years. ""It's almost certainly the case there's a risk of high death toll of female infants in the Philippines that's easy to miss if you're not looking for it,"" Antilla-Hughes said. The authors say relief workers and government officials should pay attention to the impact on infant mortality especially in the next few years in the typhoon-devastated areas.","Economic research: Researchers find spike in mortality in Filipino female infants after typhoons .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A Disneyland employee pleaded not guilty Thursday to felony possession of a destructive device in a public place during an incident where two water bottles with dry ice exploded in the theme park, authorities said Thursday. Christian Isaiah Barnes, 22, of Long Beach, California, was arraigned Thursday, and his bail was set at $500,000, said Farrah Emami, a spokeswoman for the Orange County district attorney's office. His next court date is a pretrial hearing on June 7, Emami said. The charge against Barnes carries a maximum prison sentence of six years, the district attorney's office said in a statement. Barnes, an employee at Disneyland in Anaheim, California, allegedly possessed two water bottles containing dry ice -- which can make for a destructive device called a dry ice bomb, the prosecutor's office said. The devices caused small explosions in Disneyland, authorities said. On Tuesday, Barnes was being relieved of his shift at a Disneyland vending cart outside Mickey's Toontown, prosecutors said. When Barnes opened the vending cart, the first water bottle with dry ice exploded, the prosecutor's statement said. Then Barnes allegedly took the second water bottle from the cart and, as he walked to the employee break room through Toontown, allegedly placed it in a trash can, prosecutors said. Barnes allegedly left the area, and a custodian removed the trash bag and placed it on the ground, prosecutors said. The custodian walked away from the bag to clear another trash can, and then the water bottle in the bag exploded, authorities said. Visitors were cleared from Toontown for about two hours as authorities investigated, though the rest of Disneyland remained open.

"(CNN) -- The legendary Bjorn Borg fueled his success with a daily diet of steak and potatoes. Hell raising stars of the recent past were not adverse to sinking more than a few beers after a tough match. But the modern tennis star is more likely to be teetotal and to stick to a gluten free diet -- avoiding the red meat and carbs which five-time Wimbledon champion Borg apparently ate every day. Doubles stalwart and ATP Player Council member Eric Butorac should know. He's been on the circuit for nearly a decade and rubs shoulders with the likes of Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic both on and off the court. ""I think the top players have cut alcohol completely out of their diet and the rest of the players to stay competitive have mostly followed suit,"" Butorac told CNN's Open Court program. ""It's funny because actually our tour sponsor is Corona -- so there are Coronas available wherever we want, in the locker room and in the players' lounge but it's surprising that at the end of the week they are often not even touched. Serious endeavor . ""For the most part guys treat their bodies like a temple and take it very seriously."" Butorac believes the established ""Big Four"" of Rafael Nadal, Djokovic, Andy Murray and Federer have permanently raised the bar as regards fitness and diet issues and there is no going back. With the rewards for success so large -- $31 million on offer at the 2014 season opening Australian Open -- any small margins gained can be worth a small fortune. ""If you look at the amount of money that can be won at the top of the sport or any major sport so you know that line between No.1 and No.5 in the world is worth millions and millions of dollars so I think you see these guys doing every little thing they can to achieve that,"" added Butorac. Former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash said that the move to a great emphasis on fitness and diet started during his glory years in the 1980s and 90s, but his predecessors were not so careful. ""I heard stories that the old Aussie greats used to play hard and drink hard and used to have steak and potatoes,"" said Cash. ""I once asked Bjorn Borg 'what did you eat?' and he said 'every day I had a steak and I had potatoes' and he used to play five sets of practice every day and back it up day in day out with steak and potatoes!"" Gluten free . Modern superstars such as Djokovic would not dream of that approach and it was the Serbian who started a trend with his gluten free diet, cutting out wheat and treats such as chocolate. ""This particular diet changed my life really in a positive way and affected positively my career and my overall feeling on and off the court,"" Djokovic said. As he charged to No.1 and went through 2011 with just a handful of defeats, others took notice and followed suit. ""Novak really made that popular when he really rose to the top,"" said Butorac. ""I don't know if it's a fad or if it's here to stay but it's definitely a thing that a high percentage of the guys on tour now are gluten free or almost primarily gluten free. ""I watch them taking strolls around the breakfast bar in France, bypassing the croissants and the pain au chocolats, all the different tempting things and actually staying away from it. It's pretty impressive to see them do it!"" They are helped by the more healthy offerings available at the ATP and WTA's official tournaments and with players on the road for half of the year, maybe more, this is vital. ""Players are looking to eat a lot of salads, a lot of fruits, pastas and then white meats, chicken and fish are really popular,"" Butorac said. Healthy options . ""The cuisine can vary tournament to tournament but also normally what the tournaments week in week out provide is some really healthy options that allows us to stay very fit."" But with this austere regime -- fat free and alcohol free -- has the sheer joie de vivre gone out of the game? ""I believe the fun on the tour has dropped,"" said American Butorac. ""There is very little alcohol consumed as players take their matches and practice very seriously. ""But the tour is still a great place to be and there is plenty of fun to be had, though the stories we hear about what it was like 'back in the day,' it isn't even close nowadays."" The 1987 Wimbledon champion Cash, who retired in 1997, said in his era there was still a high degree of professionalism but the difference has been advances in sports science. ""You know more about nutrition. In my day it was all about carbo loading and I think it's slightly different now, it's not just about having carbohydrates because you need protein for your muscles to recover as well,"" said the Australian great. Butorac, who is 32, has had to battle to earn a living on the ATP Tour and establish himself as the No.3 American doubles player behind the incredible Byran brothers (Bob and Mike). A recent victory in the doubles at the Malaysian Open with Raven Klaasen was proof he is still a force at the top level and aside from attention to diet, Butorac, like many others, is training smarter. ""I have become more attuned to listening to my body, when it needs rest, icing, stretching, massage and addressing minor injuries. Inspiring veterans . ""Almost every player on tour is hurt or dealing with some sort of minor injury. However, players have all become great at managing these niggles."" Butorac takes inspiration from the likes of Tommy Haas -- ""playing some of his best tennis in his mid thirties"" -- not to mention the 32-year-old Federer, who is the long-time president of the Players Council. Butorac is a vice president on the 10-member board and the group meet about half a dozen times a year to address issues such as prize money, draw sizes and the tour calendar. Player ""burn out"" has been a hot topic in recent years, making attention to diet and fitness all the more important with the increased demands placed on them. ""Players are taking their health very seriously,"" said Butorac. ""Fitness programs have reached new standards and along with that players' diets have become very healthy. ""I haven't seen actual chefs with players yet, but I have seen nutritionists who are getting the food for the player out late at night buying specific products that they want to have in their players' body the next day. Modern trend . ""And a physiotherapist is often in charge, making sure you have the protein shakes right after the match and also a specific diet that has probably been pre-arranged by a chef or nutritionist."" Tennis is not alone in this obsession with fueling the body with the right stuff. ""I think this is a trend in all sports though. I hear Steve Nash is a vegetarian and Kobe (Bryant) takes incredible care of his body,"" said Butorac. At 39 and 35 years of age respectively, the LA Lakers basketball stars serve as a powerful reminder that careers can be prolonged in the most demanding of sports by taking care what you eat.","Modern tennis players stick to rigorous diet plan .

"(CNN) -- There is a new man in Maria Sharapova's life. No, the Russian hasn't split up with tennis playing boyfriend Grigor Dimitrov. Instead she has hired Sven Groeneveld as her new coach. Sharapova has been without a coach since dumping former No. 1 Jimmy Connors in August -- they lasted one match together. Only a month earlier the four-time grand slam champion ended her long partnership with Thomas Hogstedt. In announcing her association with Groeneveld -- who has worked with Ana Ivanovic, Andy Murray and Caroline Wozniacki -- Sharapova also revealed she returned to practice after a worrying shoulder injury that has kept the 25-year-old off the tour since the summer. ""I'm happy to announce my official partnership with Sven Groeneveld,"" Sharapova told her website. ""We've been working together since I got back on the court and after seeing him on the opposing side for so many years, I'm excited to have him become a part of my team. ""It has been a very seamless transition and I have had a lot of fun with the hard work we have put in so far. Looking forward to the year ahead."" The tennis season just passed was a tale of two halves for Sharapova. She won 36 of her initial 41 matches in 2013 and reached another French Open final, losing to Serena Williams. But Sharapova hurt her hip in a second-round defeat to qualifier Michelle Larcher de Brito at Wimbledon and lost to highly touted American Sloane Stephens in Cincinnati with Connors in the stands. It proved to be her final encounter of the campaign, with the shoulder problems resurfacing. The current No. 4 underwent right shoulder surgery five years ago and there were fears her career might be over.","Maria Sharapova names Sven Groeneveld as her new tennis coach .

"(CNN) -- The likely failure of Friday's Geneva 2 conference to produce a credible political process to end Syria's civil war points up the painfully obvious: Syria -- a conflict seemingly without end -- is a moral, humanitarian and strategic tragedy. But it is neither an American tragedy nor the Obama administration's fault nor responsibility. This does not mean the United States is free to ignore the Syrian conflict; nor that its continuation doesn't negatively affect American interests. What it does mean is that the President's risk-averse policy -- containment, humanitarian assistance, helping to organize and supply certain rebel groups, and keeping open the possibility of a political track -- is absolutely right. The administration should continue to ignore its critics' call for a more assertive policy, particularly if after a failed Geneva conference, there are calls for military action. Here's why: . We can't fix Syria . With 130,000-plus dead, thousands more wounded, a traumatized nation, and the social fabric of its society in shreds, Syria is beyond immediate repair or rescue. Short of a major international military intervention, followed by a massive humanitarian and reconstruction effort in the billions and thousands of peacekeepers whose stay would be measured in years not months, the Syrian conflict will go on. The notion that America can now intercede -- or at any point in the past three years, could have intervened -- in a way that would have stabilized the situation, let alone put Syria back together in some new form, is an illusion. With 140,000 U.S. forces in Afghanistan and Iraq and trillions expended over a decade, we have not been able to fundamentally alter the politics of either nation in a way that promises security or good governance. In Egypt, where the United States supposedly had leverage from $1.3 billion in military assistance over its closest Arab partner, Washington has been unable to alter the course of Egypt's politics and has become the object of antipathy by almost every faction in the country. These failures have little to do with U.S. policy, and much more to do with the reality that America doesn't control the world and cannot dictate to societies composed of corporatist, religious and tribal elements who have their own interests and vision. To think we could dictate, let alone significantly influence Syria -- the poster child for sectarian and ethnic conflict and regional intervention -- is sheer folly. We can't even help the Syrians fix Syria . The notion that in 2011, the United States had a major opportunity to avoid the current situation, pre-empt the radicalization of the country through an infusion of jihadi groups, and unify a secular or moderate Islamist opposition is also illusory. Had the Obama administration been willing to supply a vetted opposition with sophisticated weaponry, including shoulder launched ground to air missiles, sophisticated anti-tank weaponry, and been willing to neutralize President Bashar al-Assad's air force through offensive no-fly zones, there would still have been no guarantees that a divisive and inchoate opposition could have remained unified and effective. Even military strikes in the wake of Syria's use of chemical weapons would likely have had to have been followed by a sustained military campaign of some kind. And nobody in the administration, least of all Obama, was prepared to embark on such an open-ended military campaign (for which the American people have shown no appetite). At the end of the day, such an effort would still not have answered the question: Who or what would have been able to hold the country together, stop the vendettas, police the borders and intervene to stop the inexorable struggle for control between Sunnis and Alawis? Military intervention was always a trap . The liberal interventionists and neoconservatives who have accused the administration of failing to lead never laid out an effective case as to what the relationship between U.S. military action and the political end state in Syria would be. The Iraq/Afghanistan wars are a false analogy. Nobody was talking U.S. boots on the ground in Syria. Instead the correct analogy from the two longest and among the most profitless wars in U.S. history was how precisely military action was going to achieve the objective of a stable, pluralist Syria in an Arab neighborhood in which there is not one example of such a state. President Obama was right to resist the use of force and will be right again, if in the wake of Geneva's failure there is more talk of resorting to force. The horrific revelations of mass executions will only strengthen the arguments of those who see U.S. military intervention as the only recourse. Still, the last thing the United States needs right now is a proxy war with Iran, Hezbollah and Russia in a neighborhood where they have distinct advantages. Iran is the priority . Governing is about choosing. And the president clearly made a choice that preserving the possibility of a deal with Iran on the nuclear issue was much more important than involving the United States in a war with Tehran over Syria that Washington could never win. There's no evidence to support this, but I have a strong suspicion that the decision not to respond to Syria's use of chemical weapons with military force was partly shaped by this calculation, particularly the possibility that U.S. military action might have killed Iranian forces in Syria, or to be sure increased not ameliorated tensions at a time the administration was already involved in secret talks with the mullahs who control Iran. There is no foreign policy priority more important to the Obama administration right now than getting an agreement with Iran on the nuclear issue that would prevent an Israeli military strike and make an American one unnecessary. The conventional wisdom is that a proxy war with Iran in Syria would have weakened the mullahs. But it could easily have led to the opposite reaction -- increasing Iran's sense of encirclement and an acceleration of its nuclear program. Amoral but not immoral . Syria isn't Rwanda or the Nazi Holocaust. But it is an arena where mass killings and war crimes by the regime in particular, but also by its opponents, take place routinely. The Obama administration, particularly Secretary of State John Kerry, feels deeply about this. But not so deeply that it's prepared to intervene. That reluctance to intervene militarily reflects a policy that isn't immoral. America has been more active than any other nation in providing humanitarian assistance and helping organize the Syrian opposition. If any kind of sustainable local ceasefires emerge from the Geneva process, the United States will have done much to better a horrible situation. But it is an amoral approach where moral considerations do not dictate. That is to say what drives U.S. policy in the main isn't moral or ethical; instead it is shaped by a variety of other factors, including the public's opposition to military intervention, the President's own priorities for his legacy (the middle class, not the Middle East) Iran and a general sense that the last thing this country needs is another major foreign policy failure or obligation. As a result, the administration has rightly pursued a course that is risk-averse, not risk-ready; one that understands that it cannot act alone and that even multilateral action will only have limited results, and above all, one that recognizes that there are no solutions to Syria right now, only outcomes. It's certainly not a morally or emotionally satisfying course of action. But it is the right one. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Aaron David Miller.","Aaron Miller: Even if Geneva talks fail, U.S. shouldn't intervene in Syria conflict .

"(CNN) -- Bayern Munich's record breaking run continued Saturday with Werder Bremen crushed 7-0 by Pep Guardiola's European Champions who are making Bundesliga history every week. It was an unprecedented 40th unbeaten league match for last season's treble winners and Bayern equaled their own club record of 26 away matches without defeat. But more than just mere records, it was a graphic demonstration of their goalscoring potential, with the returning Franck Ribery at the heart of the attacking prowess. The French international has not played for nearly a month in the Bundesliga through a rib injury but in the 21st minute it was his cross which was turned into his own goal by Bremen defender Assani Lukimy. Belgium defender Daniel van Buyten doubled the lead six minutes later before Ribery scored his first of the afternoon before halftime. Ribery supplied the assist for the fourth from Mario Mandzukic on the hour and a fine finish from Thomas Mueller made it five. Ribery's second and a Mario Goetze with the seventh with the last kick of the match wrapped up the rout in front of a stunned capacity crowd at the Weserstadion. Werder continue to hover above the drop zone in a disappointing season, but Bayern have a four point lead over Bayer Leverkusen, who beat third-placed Borussia Dortmund in a crunch match later Saturday. South Korea striker Son Heung-Min grabbed the 18th-minute winner after a mistake in the Dortmund defense. Both sides finished with 10 men with Leverkusen losing Bosnia defender Emir Spahic while Dortmund, who trail Bayern by 10 points, had Sokratis dismissed for a second yellow card late on. Fourth placed Borussia Moenchengladbach kept up their bid for a Champions League place with a 2-1 win at home to Schalke 04, their sixth in a row. But it is difficult to see who can stop Bayern, who last lost in the Bundesliga in October 2012 and have scored 39 goals in 15 league games this season under new boss Guardiola. Ribery's display will help press his claim for the FIFA World Footballer of the Year honor, which will be announced next month. Meanwhile, Atletico Madrid opened their defense of the Copa del Rey with 4-0 win at minnows Sant Andreu. A double from Arda Turan, flanked by goals from Raul Garcia and David Villa, gave the holders a comfortable advantage ahead of the second leg of the last 32 tie. Paris Saint-Germain went four points clear in France with a 5-0 thrashing of lowly Sochaux as Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored twice and laid on two others. It was a good response from PSG, who lost their first league game of the season in midweek to Evian. Lille can close again to within a point if they beat Bordeaux Sunday with third placed Monaco meeting Ajaccio. In Serie A, Mario Balotelli scored twice to earn AC Milan a 2-2 away draw at Livorno. He put them ahead in the eighth minute before Luca Siligardi equalized for the home side. Livorno went ahead through Paulinho then Balotelli leveled with a stunning late free kick. The sixth draw of the Italian league campaign left Milan in eighth place ahead of Sunday's games.","Bayern Munich thrash Werder Bremen 7-0 .

"(CNN) -- Maria Sharapova made a successful return to the WTA Tour on Monday -- and her boyfriend Grigor Dimitrov also won his opening match of the new season at the same Brisbane International tournament. Sharapova, on her first appearance at the Australian Open warmup event, brushed aside France's Caroline Garcia 6-3 6-0 in 63 minutes as she showed no signs of her recent shoulder problems. It was the Russian's first WTA outing since losing in the first round in Cincinnati in August -- after which she parted with coach Jimmy Connors after just one match together. The world No. 4 is now working with Sven Groeneveld, former mentor of Monica Seles and Mary Pierce, as she seeks to add to her 2008 Australian Open success this month. ""I think I was just really determined to get back on the court,"" Sharapova told reporters. ""It's been a while. I think the whole team was really ready to go out. ""I knew I was going to play Monday night a little bit ago already. I got goosebumps when I heard because I was looking forward to today even a week ago. ""It's those days you work for. It was a big step to come and a big step to play out there tonight."" The 26-year-old, who pulled out of last year's Brisbane event with shoulder problems, will next face Australian teenager Ashleigh Barty. ""She is another future star and someone that I've seen grow up from the juniors and now onto the tour,"" Sharapova said of the 190th-ranked 17-year-old, who beat veteran Slovakian Daniela Hantuchova. Barty's compatriot Casey Dellacqua will also be up against a big name in round two, having set up a clash with world No. 2 Victoria Azarenka by beating 67th-ranked Russian Galina Voskoboeva in three sets. Fourth seed Jelena Jankovic battled past former French Open champion Francesca Schiavone 6-2 7-6 (8-6), while German No. 5 Angelique Kerber, Spanish No. 8 Carla Suarez Navarro and Slovakian No. 9 Dominika Cibulkova also progressed. Dimitrov also changed coach late last season to Roger Rasheed, who has worked with Lleyton Hewitt and Gael Monfils, and they continued their strong start together as the 22-year-old beat Dutchman Robin Haase 6-2 6-3. The Bulgarian, runner-up in Brisbane last season and who won his first ATP Tour title in Stockholm in October, will next play former world No. 9 Marin Cilic. Top seed Roger Federer's first opponent in Brisbane will be Finnish veteran Jarkko Nieminen, who beat 21-year-old Australian wildcard James Duckworth. Meanwhile, Tomas Berdych's Australian Open preparations were hit Monday when the world No. 7 lost to big-serving Croation Ivo Karlovic in the opening round of the Qatar Open. Karlovic fired 24 aces against the Czech in a 7-6 (9-7) 7-6 (7-4) victory in Doha, while two-time runner-up Monfils of France and Poland's Lukasz Kubot also progressed.","World No. 4 Maria Sharapova wins her first WTA Tour match in almost five months .

"(CNN) -- Arsenal means business. A fortnight ago the critics were wondering if the Gunners could last the pace -- now that doubt looks to have been quashed -- and in some style. A 1-0 win over last year's Champions League finalist Borussia Dortmund proved Arsenal can mix it with Europe's elite when it really matters. Having lost the home fixture against the German side in north London two weeks ago, victory was essential for Arsenal to keep hold of its own destiny. And it duly obliged thanks to Aaron Ramsey's second half winner -- his 11th goal in 16 games -- not bad for a player who had only mustered five in 91 apperances for the club over the past two years. ""I was impressed mostly by our focus because we were under consistent pressure from the first to the last minute,"" Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger told Sky Sports. ""Nevertheless, we created chances and we could have scored a second. ""A year ago, I thought it would be difficult for Ramsey to score goals but he's developed tremendously and that's a huge credit to him."" Ramsey has enjoyed a stunning season -- taking the English Premier League by storm. The Wales international has been a revelation at the heart of the Arsenal midfield and his latest strike secured one of the club's most impressive European victories of modern times. Arsenal arrived in Germany to face a Dortmund side which had made its most successful start to a league season since 2010/11. Having won all eight of its home games this season, including the victory in the German Super Cup, Dortmund roared out the traps at their traditional breakneck speed. But despite dominating possession, the German side failed to find the breakthrough. Armenia international Henrikh Mkhitaryan should have done better in the first half after being played through on goal but his effort sailed wide of the post. Dortmund pushed forward again after the interval but it was Arsenal which struck the killer blow with 62 minutes on the clock. Mesut Ozil swung the ball into the penalty area and after Olivier Giroud had managed to flick the ball on, Ramsey stole in to nod home from close range. Dortmund huffed and puffed as they searched for an equalizer but only a superb save by Roman Weidenfeller denied Ramsey a second as Arsenal broke at speed. Per Mertesacker sent a header just over the crossbar as the visiting side looked to double its advantage. And although Dortmund pushed forward late on, it was unable to find the equalizer it so badly craved. ""We dominated, we worked, we had good runs and we did a lot of things right. We played good football and it was not boring,"" said Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp. ""But we lacked the finish. We should have done more from our possession."" Dortmund now faces a fierce fight to qualify for the next stage after Napoli recorded a 3-2 win over Marseille. The Italian side sits second, three points clear of Dortmund, with the two teams scheduled to meet in Germany on November 26. Gonzalo Higuain scored twice and Gokhan Inler was also on target for Napoli, which is level on nine points with Arsenal . Elsewhere, Lionel Messi ended his goal drought with a double in Barcelona's 3-1 win over Milan. The victory books Barcelona's place in the last 16 with two games to spare. Messi fired home the opener from the penalty spot before Sergio Busquets headed a second. Milan, which sits second in the group, did pull a goal back when Barca defender Gerard Pique inadvertently diverted Kaka's cross into his own net. But Messi sealed the win seven minutes from time with a classy finish to ensure Barca's place in the knockout phase for the 10th year in a row. Ajax is still in the mix in Group H following a 1-0 win over Scottish champion Celtic in Amsterdam. Lasse Schone scored the only goal of the game for the Dutch side, which has taken four points from four games -- one fewer than Milan. Chelsea looks in good shape to qualify from Group E following a 3-0 win over German side Schalke. Samuel Eto'o scored twice and Demba Ba was also on target as Chelsea bounced back from its weekend defeat in the Premier League at Newcastle. ""I think it was good response but of course the first 15 minutes were difficult,"" Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho told Sky. ""We were a team without big maturity and stability after the defeat on Sunday. After that we played very well and kept possession in a comfortable way and after the first goal we played well."" Swiss side Basel is still in contention to qualify after it stole a late equalizer to draw 1-1 with Steaua Bucharest. Basel is in third place but just one point behind Schalke with two games remaining. In Group G, Atletico Madrid qualified for the next stage with a comfortable 4-0 win over Austria Vienna. Miranda gave Atletico an early lead before strikes from Raul Garcia and Filipe Luis sent the home side into the break with a three-goal cushion. Diego Costa added a fourth after the interval as Atletico equalled Bayern Munich's feat of qualifying for the last-16 with four consecutive victories. Zenit St. Petersburg sits second in the table following its 1-1 draw against Porto in the day's early game.","Arsenal claims victory at Borussia Dortmund with Aaron Ramsey goal .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- An anti-government protest leader was shot to death Sunday as demonstrators blocked a voting station in Bangkok, police said. Suthin Thararin, a protest leader for the People's Democratic Reform Committee (PDRC), was killed in front of Sri Eiam Temple in the Thai capital, Police Col. Thawatkiat Jindakuansanong said. Nine others were injured in the shooting, medical officials said. Protesters have been calling for the democratically elected Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra to step down. They want to replace her administration with an unelected ""people council,"" which would see through electoral and political changes. After a series of recent outbreaks of violence, Thai authorities declared a state of emergency last week, giving extra powers to security forces. On Friday, a Thai court ruled that elections scheduled for next month could be postponed. Thararin's death came after anti-government protesters blocked a voting station and shut it down after officials agreed to suspend the voting, police said. While the protesters were coming out of the area, there were several rounds of gunshots, police said.. Jindakuansanong could not confirm the identity of the shooter or shooters, but said anti-government protesters encountered pro-government supporters, and the two sides exchanged verbal assaults. Meanwhile, more than 45 out 50 polling stations have been closed due to obstructions by opposition protesters from the PDRC, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Affairs Minister Surapong Tovijakchaikul said.

"(CNN) -- A North Dakota freshman walked in front of his class, made an apology and then shot himself with a handgun Thursday morning, Richland County authorities said. The injured boy was coherent when he was taken to a hospital, said Principal Jay Townsend of Fairmount Public School, which has 112 students from kindergarten through 12th grade. Authorities don't know what the apology was about, Sheriff Larry Leshovsky said. The student wasn't in any kind of trouble that the principal was aware of. The freshman, whose name wasn't being released, has lived in the small, rural community of 380 residents his entire life and has spent all educational years at Fairmount School, Mayor Jon Nelk said. The student was transferred to a hospital in Fargo, but the mayor had no further details. The student's grandparents grew up in the Fairmount area and his parents have lived in town their entire lives, Nelk said. ""As far as I know, he's a well-behaved, good kid,"" the mayor said. ""We're a rural area, but guns are not commonplace."" The shooting was ""an isolated incident"" for the town, Nelk said. ""I'm sure when we sit down this evening and start playing it back, we'll try to figure out what could have possibly happened and why this happened,"" Nelk said. ""It's a very tight community. ""I've had a lot of conversations with parents and some students. They're quite worried and hoping that our prayers go out to the child and the family and the friends,"" the mayor said. A teacher provided first-aid to the boy, and the school went into lockdown shortly after the 8:40 a.m. shooting, Townsend said. An alert system called all parents, and school was canceled for the day, Townsend said. School will resume Friday, when counselors will be on hand, the principal said.

"(CNN) -- Pausing to catch her breath at the bottom of the mountain, Lindsey Vonn was back in business. It may not have been fast, it may not have been smooth but it was still a landmark moment for the Olympic downhill champion. The American skiing star had finished her first race since making a complicated recovery from a knee injury. Vonn needed reconstructive surgery on her right knee after landing heavily on the opening day of the Alpine Ski World Championships in Austria in February. She has waited 10 months to go racing again and in November her return was put on ice when she partially tore one of her reconstructed knee ligaments in training. There were no complications for Vonn on her first competitive return down Canada's Lake Louise course -- but her time did not trouble the leaders. She finished her run in one minute 59.22 seconds -- more than three seconds off the leading time and 40th overall. The start of the race had been delayed by hazy cloud and extremely cold temperatures which dropped as low as -36 Celsius. Germany's Maria Hoefl-Riesch eventually came out on top with the quickest time. Vonn is racing against time to find form and fitness as she attempts to defend her downhill crown at February's Winter Olympics in the Russian resort of Sochi. There she will aim to emulate the feat of fellow American, Picabo Street, who came back the season after reconstructive surgery to win gold at Nagano in 1998. Vonn, who is dating golfer Tiger Woods, is a four-time overall World Cup champion and has won two world championship golds in a glittering career on the slopes.","Lindsey Vonn takes part in first ski competition in 10 months .

"(CNN) -- The Epsom Derby is the most famous horse race in Britain -- and, arguably, the world. Dating back to 1780, it has spawned many imitations -- 140 countries now have a ""Derby,"" perhaps most notably in the U.S. state of Kentucky. Indeed, the word ""derby"" is now generally used to describe any race for three-year-olds. ""To me it's the most significant race in the world,"" says trainer Andrew Balding, whose Kingsclere stables have yards named after great Epsom Derby winners of the past, such as Ormonde and Flying Fox. ""There are more valuable races, but you can't buy 200 years of history. It is a very special event for anyone who is British. It's still very much the race that everyone wants to win."" The Epsom Derby counts the Queen of England as one of its biggest fans. She has attended all but two Derbies during her reign and will be there on June 2 as she kicks off her weekend of Jubilee celebrations with a visit to Epsom Downs. The race is named after its founder, the 12th Earl of Derby who, along with his friend Sir Charles Bunbury, conceived the idea of a race to establish which horse was the best of his or her generation. Today it draws crowds of up to 200,000 people, attracted by the sight of the best three-year-olds from England -- and ever further afield -- competing for a purse of more than $2 million. Ormonde won the race in 1886, while fellow English Triple Crown champion Flying Fox -- also stabled at Kingsclere -- did so in 1899. But there's one name that means more to the folk at Balding's Kingsclere headquarters than any other -- Mill Reef. Trained by Balding's father Ian, Mill Reef was considered by many to be the greatest racehorse of his day. He easily won the 1971 Derby by two lengths from Linden Tree before going on to capture the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in Paris later that year. He doesn't just have a yard named after him, he has his own statue. Now, 41 years after Mill Reef's victory, Balding believes he has a colt capable of emulating the feats of one of the greatest racehorses of the last century -- a sleek dark bay by the name of Bonfire. The horse booked his place in Saturday's race thanks to a sparkling performance in the Dante Stakes at York in May. But Balding concedes that his spirited personality makes getting the best from the colt something of a challenge. ""He is very talented but he is quite a character -- not the most straightforward to train!"" As such he has been only lightly raced, and will go into Epsom with just three starts under his belt. ""It's not ideal,"" concedes Balding. ""At least he's got Group 1 experience (the sport's top level of competition) from last year, so we know he is the caliber of horse that should be running in the Derby."" Balding took over the reins of the racing operation from his father in 2003 and tasted immediate success when his filly Casual Look captured the Epsom Oaks -- the fillies' equivalent of the Derby -- in June of that year. Ian remains a familiar presence on the yard, riding out every day on his retired racehorse, Pinch of Salt. He is an avuncular figure to many of the young exercise riders, although where training matters are concerned he is happy to defer to his son these days. The legacy of Mill Reef is harder to shake off. His statue takes pride of place at Kingsclere, an imperious presence watching over his young pretenders as the mist rolls in from the South Downs. Bred in the United States, the half-cousin to the great Secretariat was sent to the United Kingdom as a yearling as it was thought that his action was better suited to the turf tracks of Europe than the dirt courses of his native continent. It was a gamble that paid off. In 14 starts, he failed to win just twice, most memorably in the 2,000 Guineas -- the first of the English ""Classics"" -- when he was beaten by Brigadier General, who would go on to prove himself one of the greatest milers of all time. But it was his performance in the Epsom Derby that year that earned Mill Reef his place in the pantheon of greats: cruising around Tattenham Corner in fourth place, any doubts over his ability to handle the mile-and-a-half distance were dispelled as soon he passed the two-furlong pole. From that point on the result was never in doubt. But if it was his exploits in the Derby that brought him to the attention of those outside the racing world, it was what happened to him next that cemented his position in the public's affection. It was during a routine training gallop that the colt stumbled and shattered his leg, bringing his racing career to a grotesque and bitter end. An injury such as Mill Reef's is almost always fatal. But rather than euthanize the colt, a veterinary specialist was flown in to operate. During the course of the six-hour operation, a metal plate and three screws were inserted into the damaged leg. He would never race again, but his life had been saved. If Bonfire is to emulate his illustrious predecessor, he will have to get past a strong field including Aiden O'Brien's unbeaten colt Camelot, who goes into the Derby having already captured the Guineas. O'Brien's second and third strings, Astrology and Imperial Monarch, have both impressed on recent outings. In any other year, Bonfire would probably be considered the favorite to land England's premier Classic, but Camelot holds that position with the British bookmakers. Bonfire will be partnered in the Derby, as usual, by Jimmy Fortune, who will be hoping for better luck in running than their last outing at Group 1 level, when he finished third behind French Fifteen. Fortune is adept at managing Bonfire's quirks but he'll need all his experience to cope with the famously fast Epsom course (the track rises 150 feet in the first half-mile, leveling out before a downhill stretch round Tattenham Corner). ""My father managed to win the Derby with a great horse, who was one of the most famous horses of the last century,"" says Balding. ""It would be lovely to do it again."" The stone masons of Kingsclere had better be prepared to work overtime after Derby Day, because there might just be a yard with Bonfire's name on it.","Andrew Balding hoping to emulate his father Ian by training an Epsom Derby winner .

"(CNN) -- A proposed new "".africa"" internet domain name will provide a stronger brand identity than current little known country domains, while preventing registration revenues flowing abroad, say backers. DotConnectAfrica, a non-profit organization registered in Mauritius, is one of the groups vying to establish and operate the dot africa name space for businesses and individuals across the continent. The opportunity has arisen since the Internet Corporation for Names and Numbers (ICANN), the body which manages internet domain names, voted earlier this year to allow new varieties of top-level domains -- the suffix of an internet address. ICANN will be accepting applications for new generic top-level domains, or gTLDs, between January and April next year, with successful applications expected to be operational by 2013. Two other groups -- the African Top-Level Domains Association and the African Registry Consortium -- have also expressed an interest in applying to operate "".africa"", while the African Union has said it plans to endorse a group to apply for the rights to operate the domain on its behalf. The African Union Commission also plans to apply to ICANN to operate the "".africa"" domain, along with the French and Arabic alternatives "".afrique"" and "".afriqia"". It is currently running an open tender process for technical organizations to operate the domains on its behalf, which will be included in the AUC's application to ICANN. DotConnectAfrica executive director Sophia Bekele said that the suffixes for individual African countries -- country code top-level domains, or ccTLDs -- had generally proven unpopular during the decade or so of their existence. Research by her company suggested 80% of African domain name registrants had opted for "".com"" or "".org"" suffixes instead, which were price competitive, reliable to register and had wide recognition. By contrast, the ccTLDs were little known, as they were ""usually owned by governments, and governments are typically not very good at marketing,"" she said. Moctar Yedaly, head of information society for the African Union Commission, said the commission's vision for the .africa domain went beyond the commercial. ""It may well be a very good business in terms of money generating. If it may generate some revenue we can use for the development of ICT in Africa, then that is all very good, but that's not my primary goal,"" he said. ""My primary goal is to ensure the identity of Africa, the image, the culture are well-maintained."" The .africa domain represented all Africans in the same way as the African Union flag, and its dignity needed to be protected. ""I wouldn't like to see '.africa' used for something pornographic,"" he said. It should operate in the ""interests of the community"", rather than the interests of individuals in the private sector. ""This is for Africa, and Africa is 54 states."" Bekele said that in campaigning to build support for DotConnectAfrica's proposal, the group had encountered a strong response from youth and from business for the notion of a pan-African online identity. More than 3,600 prospective registrants had expressed interest by ""pre-registering"" with DotConnectAfrica. She said young developers involved in creating local content felt a stronger affinity with a potential "".africa"" suffix than to "".com"" domains, while it also appealed to corporates, who would be able to unify their presence across the continent under a single online brand. John Kariuki is the founder and CEO of AAR Credit Services, a Kenyan-based micro-finance company. The company also operates in Uganda and Tanzania, where it is looking to expand its operations, but currently uses a Kenyan ""co.ke"" suffix. ""For companies looking to expand throughout Africa, it's a good way of creating a brand identity,"" he said of the potential domain. ""What really appeals to us is expressing that African identity. Sometimes you don't really know where these companies are from."" Bekele said that if her group was successful in its application to establish and operate the domain, it would look offer domains at prices competitive to "".com"" registrations -- $5 for students, or between $9 to $19 for small- to medium-enterprises. A major benefit of the "".africa"" domain would be that proceeds from African domain registrations would remain on the continent, rather than flowing offshore. DotConnectAfrica says it plans to reinvest surpluses into developing the African internet sector. She said there was concern from governments that a "".africa"" domain could jeopardize the existing ccTLDs. ""But I can assure you, if there is no '.africa', I don't think there will be any more uptake of the ccTLDs,"" she said. However, not everyone is as optimistic about the potential impact of the new generic top-level domains. Ray Valdes, vice-president of web services for tech consultancy Gartner, said that because the new wave of gTLDs went ""against the grain of current consumer trends"", his company expected most of them to fall short of their goals. To be successful, the new gTLDs would require a change in consumer behavior, plus a change in how search engines index the internet. Users would have to type unfamiliar text strings into the address bar of the their browser, at a time when consumers were increasingly relying on search engines and social media to navigate the internet. He said that given the $185,000 price tag to apply for the new gTLDs, most organizations would be better served by investing in creating faster, more usable sites that are more easily indexed by search engines, and broadening the social media presence of their organization. However, he did expect a handful of regional-based gTLDs like "".africa"" to be successful, depending on how well they were operated and how consumers responded. ICANN will not make a decision on control of the domain until after the application closes in April next year.","A number of groups are vying for the right to operate the "".africa"" internet domain .

"Zurich, Switzerland (CNN) -- Top international soccer officials are meeting Thursday in Switzerland to discuss whether to change the dates for the 2022 World Cup tournament in Qatar from summer to winter amid concerns over heat. The two-day meeting of FIFA's executive committee in Zurich will also consider allegations that migrant workers employed on huge World Cup-related construction projects are being abused. Dozens of workers' rights protesters, waving flags and brandishing red cards, gathered outside the complex ahead of the meeting as they delivered a letter to FIFA President Sepp Blatter calling on soccer's world governing body to ensure fair labor practices. A FIFA official took the letter inside, saying that FIFA is taking the matter seriously. Members of the executive committee, known as ExCo, declined to answer reporters' questions as they entered. In addition to the issues of Qatar's summer heat and concerns over labor conditions, the committee is expected to hear an update from Qatar 2022 organizers on their preparations for the World Cup. FIFA has been considering the option of moving the tournament because of fears that players and fans could be adversely affected by temperatures that sometimes reach 122 degrees Fahrenheit during the summer. All 54 member associations of UEFA, Europe's governing body, last month voted against holding the tournament in the Qatari summer, adding to speculation that a move to the winter was in prospect. But a winter World Cup would cause chaos with the European domestic season, with many clubs fearing they could lose out financially. Decision, or no decision? The final decision lies with FIFA's executive committee. Its verdict had been widely expected to come Friday -- but UEFA President Michel Platini has reportedly cast doubt on that. ""There will be no decision. It is impossible,"" he is quoted by Britain's Daily Telegraph newspaper as saying Wednesday in Zurich. Platini reportedly added that he was ""much more concerned"" by the allegations of abusive labor practices in Qatar than the question of when the tournament is played. FIFA said last week that it would raise the issue of workers' rights with the Qatari authorities and that the executive committee would discuss claims that migrant workers are being exploited. A CNN report in May highlighted allegations by rights groups that thousands of construction workers building the infrastructure for the 2022 World Cup have been abused, denied their wages and trapped in a situation from which they cannot escape because, under Qatar's visa system, they cannot leave the country without their employer's consent. Allegations made by The Guardian newspaper last week added to concerns. The world professional footballers association, FIFPro, said that ""Qatar must respect the rights of the key people who will deliver the 2022 FIFA World Cup: the workers who build the World Cup stadia and infrastructure and the professional footballers who play in them."" The Qatar 2022 Supreme Committee has said it is committed to ensuring workers' safety and well being. Labor ministry: More inspectors, translators . Ali Al Khulaifi, an international relations adviser at Qatar's Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, told CNN that Qatar is taking concrete steps to ensure its labor rules are enforced, including making it easier for workers to report abuses by their employers. ""We have a plan to double the number of inspectors by the end of the year,"" he said. ""Since many of the migrant workers don't speak Arabic, we are hiring translators to submit complaints."" The Ministry of Labor says it plans to increase the number of branches it has from the current two in the capital, Doha, and five outside, but has not given details. Conditions for workers in Qatar have come under increased scrutiny since a report in The Guardian last week alleging that dozens of Nepali migrant laborers died there over the summer. ""We are a member of the ILO (International Labour Organization). We have ratified the forced labor convention. So we're hiring an international firm to look into the allegations,"" Al Khulaifi said . ""Work-related deaths are really unfortunate. But the numbers are less than what was published."" He said the ministry would investigate any claims that some companies are holding the passports of workers, preventing them from leaving, as has been alleged. The ministry has commissioned an international law firm, DLA Piper, to carry out independent investigation into the allegations and report back to the government, the state-run Qatar News Agency reported Wednesday. Legal action threatened . The question of any shift in the calendar for the 2022 Qatar World Cup -- or, more drastically, any move to take it away from the wealthy Gulf nation -- will be closely watched around the world. Australia, which lost out to Qatar along with South Korea, the United States and Japan, believes it should be compensated if the World Cup is held in the winter rather than the summer and has threatened legal action. A move to the winter months could also have big cost implications for European clubs and for broadcasters. Moving matches means shifting many of the events that the latter have paid multimillions for and, importantly, would be wanting to tie up in contracts for the future. Blatter, the FIFA president, recently said that it would not be feasible to hold a summer World Cup in Qatar. But Qatar disagrees. Hassan al-Thawadi, secretary general of the Qatar 2022 Supreme Committee, told CNN last week that it is ""absolutely not"" too hot during the summer to stage the tournament then. He acknowledged that summer in his country is hot, but said, ""Other nations have hosted similar World Cups in similar if not more severe conditions."" In addition, he said, Qatar is investing in cooling technologies for stadiums, training areas and fan areas. This, he said, ""adds more confidence to us in terms of our ability to host a very successful and very memorable World Cup.""

"(CNN) -- The grim toll from a typhoon that devastated southern Philippines earlier this month continues to climb, with 1,020 reported dead as of Sunday morning, authorities said. Officials fear the toll from the December 4 storm will rise further. Because while rescue crews continue searching, the chances of finding people alive dim with each passing day. With 844 still missing and 1.2 million families displaced, Bopha is the strongest and deadliest storm to hit the Philippines this year, according to the country's emergency management agency. Among the missing are hundreds of fishermen who went to sea before the storm hit. Officials hope that they could yet be found sheltering on small islands out at sea. If the death toll continues to rise, Bopha could eventually prove deadlier than Tropical Storm Washi, which killed 1,268 people a year ago. But its toll would still remain far below that of Tropical Storm Thelma, the country's most lethal storm on record that left more than 5,000 people dead in 1991. The worst of the death and destruction from Bopha took place on the southern island of Mindanao, where the storm hit first and hardest with gusts as strong as 220 kph (138 mph). The storm, known locally as Pablo, was the most powerful typhoon to hit Mindanao in decades. It set off flash floods and landslides that engulfed people sheltering in their rickety houses in remote, unprepared regions of the island.","The chances of finding people alive dim with each passing day .

"(CNN) -- California's Supreme Court on Tuesday denied the San Diego County clerk's request to immediately halt same-sex marriages in the state, the latest, if not necessarily last, key ruling in a years-long legal fight. The decision was announced in a brief ruling, which said: ""The request for an immediate temporary stay or injunctive relief is denied."" Kamala Harris, California's attorney general, also tweeted the news. She is among the state officials who have supported same-sex marriage and opposed the implementation of Proposition 8, a referendum that limited marriages in the state to those between a man and a woman. The U.S. Supreme Court paved the way last month for gay and lesbian couples to resume marrying in the state. In a lengthy court document filed last Friday with California's Supreme Court, San Diego County Clerk Ernest Dronenburg asked the court to order Gov. Jerry Brown, Harris and other state officials to abide by an ""immediate temporary stay"" to once again halt same-sex marriages. ""Petitioner has been placed in an unsustainable position because, among other things, he has been threatened with legal action by the attorney general for exercising his public duties consistent with state law defining marriage as the union between one man and one woman,"" Dronenburg argued. Earlier Tuesday -- before the state high court's decision came down -- same-sex marriage supporters gathered in San Diego to decry the efforts by Dronenburg and his supporters to continue their fight. ""Your religion, I respect it, I don't agree with it,"" LGBT rights activist Sean Sala said. ""But my religion and your religion do not run this land. The Constitution of the United States runs this land."" At one point, Dronenburg himself came out to make his case, addressing reporters as his opponents stood around him. The clerk said he wanted California's Supreme Court to halt same-sex marriages because of what had happened once before: such weddings took place only to be later ruled to be against state law. ""I asked for a stay because it's cruel to set up people,"" the county clerk said. The back-and-forth over same-sex marriage in California has been playing out in the courts and in political forums for years. Fast Facts: Same-sex marriage . In May 2008, California's Supreme Court struck down the state's ban on same-sex marriage, ruling that the state's constitution gives ""this basic civil right to (marry to) all Californians, whether gay or heterosexual, and to same-sex couples as well as to opposite-sex couples."" The tide turned a few months later, when 52% of voters backed Proposition 8 to halt gay and lesbian marriages. Yet state officials declined to stand behind the prohibition, even if private parties did. A federal appeals court subsequently ruled that Proposition 8 was unconstitutional, though it still issued a stay on same-sex marriages until the U.S. Supreme Court could weigh in. That happened June 26, when the nation's high court -- in a 5-4 decision -- dismissed an appeal of the earlier lower court ruling on narrow, jurisdictional grounds. High court lets same-sex marriages in California continue . Two days later, the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals officially lifted the previous injunction and same-sex weddings took place very soon thereafter. Proposition 8 backers tried to get the U.S. Supreme Court to again intervene, but Justice Anthony Kennedy refused to do so. Since filing his petition, Dronenburg has become a champion for those who favor restricting marriage to heterosexuals. In a tweet several days ago, for instance, the American Family Association's Bryan Fischer compared the county clerk to civil rights icon Rosa Parks for refusing ""to violate CA constitution on wedding licenses."" Gay rights groups, like Marriage Equality USA, cheered Tuesday's decision denying Dronenburg's request. Still, San Diego Gay and Lesbian News reported that the long, winding legal battle hasn't necessarily come to an end. ""It's not over!"" tweeted that organization, which describes itself as ""a proud member of the San Diego LGBT community."" ""California Supreme Court still has to has to hear petitions to halt same-gender marriage in August.""","NEW: A county clerk says he asked for a stay ""because it's cruel to set up people""

The man, who also wore sunglasses, placed a package on the teller's counter. It was wrapped with what appears in a surveillance photo to be pink gift wrap. The man handed the teller a note demanding cash. The note suggested the package was harmful, police said. He was given money. Authorities haven't disclosed how much.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Samer Issawi, a Palestinian who once refused solid food in a 266-day protest while in an Israeli prison, was released Monday. Issawi originally had been set free in late 2011 after nine years in prison but ended up back in detention nine months later for what Israeli officials said was a parole violation. He was never charged, however. To protest, he went on a solid-food fast from August 2012 to April 2013, being kept alive by intravenous fluids injections. On the verge of death, he was offered a variety of deportation deals but he refused. And instead of serving out the rest of his original 30-year sentence, he agreed to stay in prison for the remaining eight months of his administrative detention period for the parole violation. After his release Monday, he returned to his home in the Jerusalem neighborhood of Issawiyeh. He was greeted by hundreds of chanting Palestinians who ignored the warning of Israeli forces against celebrating. Many waved Palestinian flags. Issawi had been arrested in 2002 during the second intifada and charged with attempted murder and weapons possession. In October 2011, Israel freed more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners -- including Issawi and hundreds serving life sentences for attacks on Israelis -- in exchange for Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, who had been held by Hamas for more than five years.","Samer Issawi nearly died during a hunger strike that lasted more than eight months .

"(CNN) -- Rory McIlroy may be hoping to exorcise some demons when he returns to the scene of one of his career lows at this week's Honda Classic in Florida. At last year's tournament, the world No. 8 walked off the course in the middle of a dismal second round, blaming a sore wisdom tooth. McIlroy, who lost his number one ranking and took until December to win a tournament in a difficult 2013 season, described his Honda hiccup as the lowest point of the year. ""Probably The Honda back (last) February,"" McIlroy told PGATour.com, when asked for his low point. ""I made a mistake walking off the course and disappointed not just myself. ""Golf can be a frustrating game and emotionally tough. What's important, though, is that I've learned from that episode. I need to stay patient and play my way through the difficult patches."" The Northern Ireland golfer also switched to Nike clubs in a multimillion-dollar deal at the start of last season and found the transition from his former Titleist equipment wasn't quite as smooth as he would have liked. But he believes he has now quite literally got into the swing with his new equipment. ""It would be fantastic to be 100% comfortable with all 14 clubs at the same time,"" McIlroy said. ""It was worth taking the time to get it right. I'm pretty settled with the kit, to be honest."" The tournament at the PGA National course will unite seven of the world's top-10 players -- more than in any event of the season so far. It is also the first tournament of 2014 where the top three -- Tiger Woods, Adam Scott and Henrik Stenson -- have competed in the same field.

"(CNN) -- Jurors in the DWI trial of Kerry Kennedy, daughter of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, on Monday watched the seemingly disoriented defendant allegedly failing three sobriety tests on video recorded by a police vehicle dashboard camera after her July 2012 accident in New York. Kennedy, also former wife of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, faces a charge of driving while intoxicated, accused of driving erratically and striking a tractor-trailer on the morning of July 13, 2012, on an interstate in Westchester. She later tested positive for zolpidem, a sleep aid also known by the brand name Ambien, according to testimony. Kennedy claims she took the medication accidentally when she mixed up medicine bottles. She could serve up to one year in prison if convicted. Her attorney, Gerald Lefcourt, told the jury that while Kennedy does not expect any advantage because of her famous last name, she should not be punished because of it. Among her supporters were brothers Robert Jr. and Douglas Kennedy, and their mother Ethel Kennedy, 85, who was pushed in a wheelchair inside the Westchester County Courthouse in White Plains. A jury of four men and two women was seated last week, along with two male alternates. During opening statements, Assistant District Attorney Stefanie DeNise said that even if Kennedy, 54, had taken the sleep aid unintentionally, she had a responsibility to pull her Lexus SUV off the road safely when she began to feel its effects. Lefcourt disputed that argument, saying Kennedy had no time to react. ""The zolpidem kicks in, it shuts her down, she's in a state of 'sleep driving,'"" he said. Lefcourt told the panel that his client has a legal prescription for the sleep medication to help her as she travels internationally on behalf of the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights. Judge Robert Neary interrupted Lefcourt when he began to describe Kennedy's humanitarian work against sexual slavery and poverty and asked him to comment only on the evidence in the case. Jurors also heard from a motorist who witnessed Kennedy's vehicle swerving off the road repeatedly and another witness who later found her slumped over the steering wheel in the turn lane of an intersection, apparently ""passed out."" The prosecution will continue its case Tuesday morning with the testimony of a New York State Police trooper trained as a drug-recognition expert. Lefcourt has said Kennedy will testify in the trial, which is expected to last for several days.","Jurors watch video of Kerry Kennedy allegedly failing 3 sobriety tests .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Construction has started for about 600 new housing units in the West Bank since the Israeli settlement freeze ended late last month, the group Peace Now said Thursday. Yariv Oppenheimer, the group's director, said the Israeli peace organization has surveyed the construction activity and will come out with a detailed report next week. The group has long monitored Jewish settlement activity in the Palestinian territory of the West Bank. The settlement construction issue is threatening to scuttle the reactivated and now stalled peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians. The Palestinians demanded a continuation of the settlement freeze in order to continue with the talks, and the United States has urged Israel to stop settlement activity. But the Israeli government has not continued the freeze. A source in the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who asked not to be identified because he is not authorized to speak about the issue, said, ""it is clear"" that any ""limited"" construction won't alter ""the future peace map and that there is a need to return to the negotiating table."" The source said a large part of the construction is in the existing settlement blocs. Ghassan Khatib, a Palestinian government spokesman, told CNN that the settlement building reports ""are very alarming because it is happening on the expense of our basic rights, on our land, and because it will reflect negatively on the sincere effort that the United States and the Quartet members are undertaking to resume a meaningful political process,"" a reference to the United States, Russia, the European Union, and the United Nations. ""We also think that this is a big challenge to the American efforts that would require doubling the pressure on Israel to respect the international legality and requirements of the peace process."" Dani Dayan, the chairman of the Yesha Council, which represents Israeli settlers, said life is back to normal in the West Bank. ""In the last 10 months there was no new construction. After the freeze ended, private people and private contractors who already have building permits decide if they want to start building or not; it's their own private decision. Most of the construction is happening in the settlement blocs."" Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, in Israel as part of a mission of world leaders called the Elders, told reporters he hopes Israel will halt its settlement activities long enough for the talks to resume.  He noted that Palestinian leaders said they wouldn't go back to the table as long as the activity continues. Raising the issue of what would happen if direct talks were not resumed, he said the Palestinians could pursue other options, such as asking the United Nations for recognition of a state of Palestine on lands seized by Israel during the 1967 war -- Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Wednesday the U.S. position on settlements is ""well-known and has not changed. And our determination to encourage the parties to continue talking has not wavered. ""We have no illusions about the difficulty of resolving the final status issues of borders and security, settlements and refugees, of Jerusalem and water. And it's no secret that we are in a difficult period."" At a Washington event for the American Task Force on Palestine, Clinton said authorities knew ""there would be setbacks and struggles"" when Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Netanyahu came to Washington in September to relaunch direct talks. ""I cannot stand here tonight and tell you there is some magic formula that I have discovered that will break through the current impasse. But I can tell you we are working every day, sometimes every hour, to create the conditions for negotiations to continue and succeed,"" said Clinton. ""We are urging both sides to avoid any actions that would undermine trust or prejudice the outcomes of the talks. Sen. Mitchell will soon return to the region for further consultations,"" she added, referring to former Sen. George Mitchell, who is the Obama administration's special Middle East envoy. ""We have not given up and neither have President Abbas or Prime Minister Netanyahu."" The American Task Force on Palestine is a nonprofit, nonpartisan group ""dedicated to advocating that it is in the American national interest to promote an end to the conflict in the Middle East through a negotiated agreement that provides for two states -- Israel and Palestine -- living side by side in peace and security,"" according to a statement on its website.

"(CNN) -- I am a movie critic. But because I am not employed by a newspaper, or a television station, Web magazine, ad agency or any institution that contributes to or profits from the media carnival that has become the Academy Awards, I can admit without fear of repercussion that the Oscars leave me colder than an arctic vortex. If there were some remote planet or sun-kissed island where I could flee the din, I would go there. But I bet even remote outposts, windswept Siberian tundra or ships lost at sea, places without water or central heating, have a pipeline to the Oscar countdown. Like Christmas and the presidential campaign, the Oscar race -- a misnomer, suggesting speed -- goes on too damn long. This is true even in a year when the nominees are more exciting than usual, perhaps even justifying the oft-made claim that the Academy has become younger and less stodgy. ""American Hustle"" is a comedy; ""Her"" a delicate love story between a man and a computer program; ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" raucous and controversial, ""Nebraska"" bleak. (Of course, we have been shocked before. Remember ""Midnight Cowboy."") The Academy has never been a barometer of quality, in fact it has a fairly dismal record when it comes to truly great or slightly difficult films. It's tended to favor the inspirational over the fatalistic; high-minded drama over comedy and noir; British over American (""The King's Speech"" vs. ""The Social Network""). When TCM, the channel to which I am devoted above all others, programs a whole month of Oscar winners I lose interest. Other media outlets are not so restrained. The New York Times, like other organs of record no doubt, begins early -- sometime in summer -- with possibilities and probabilities, profiles and features leading up to and exploiting the fall's releases, until it's virtually blanket coverage. Brains that should be doing better things are busy handicapping and making lists. Like the presidential primaries (remember when Hillary was a sure winner?), the forecasts are wrong as often as not, but nobody's ever held accountable. Now that the Golden Globes have become the rehearsal dinner to the Oscar ceremony and fashion gets more coverage than international and domestic news combined, we watch as an armada of reporters is deployed to relay the buzz, and stories spill over into every section except sports. But more important is what this carefully staged mass hysteria and nonstop coverage does to the movies and the stars. Films that open early in the year are virtually shut out by the bottom-heavy pattern of release and ruckus surrounding the end-of-year ""prestige"" films. Gems like ""Before Midnight,"" ""Mud,"" and ""Frances Ha"" might as well have opened seven years ago rather than a mere seven months. Actors who've given outstanding, complex performances are suddenly pleading for love like orphan puppies, parading from one show to another, forever on display. Where are the handlers that used to manage the careers of stars, keeping them at a discreet distance from the fans and allowing them some semblance of mystery? The irony is that as fewer people are going to movies, the annual spectacle that is the Oscars is taking up greater and greater space in the public arena. The upside is supposed to be a rare communal pleasure -- the way such occasions (as the clichÃ© has it) bring the country together. Like Christmas. Or the political campaign. Or a natural disaster. For once in our fragmented era, old and young, blue and red, presumably join hands in a virtual auditorium to admire some dresses and laugh at some jokes. But wait! If I remember correctly (and the evenings do blur into one another), our host last year was someone who had almost nothing to do with movies, who conducted a sort of insider colloquy with the designated demographic, young males who watch television. So much for cross-generational rapprochement. Television grasping for viewers to lure advertisers, newspapers bumping up movie ads, the actors withering from overexposure and the films themselves all but anti-climactic in the final hour: How can even the best keep the sparkle of surprise? ""American Hustle"" with its exquisite choreography and sly tease -- I'm still trying to figure out who knew what when. Spike Jonze's ingenious ""Her,"" a man-machine romance that proves that science fiction and sex are not mutually exclusive. When the night comes, I'll watch of course. And vow to go to bed before midnight. And stay up anyway. After all, the Golden Globes was worth watching just for Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, and maybe Ellen de Generes can make the long hours of Sunday night, March 2, tolerable this year. But in the meantime, I'll fight my uphill battle to ignore Oscar stories. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Molly Haskell.","Film critic Molly Haskell doesn't work for an outlet and can admit the Oscars leave her cold .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's upcoming Christmas message will say Jesus would be a defender of the oppressed if he were alive today. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad will deliver his Christmas message on Channel 4. ""Jesus the Son of Mary is the standard-bearer of justice, of love for our fellow human beings, of the fight against tyranny, discrimination and injustice,"" Ahmadinejad will say, according to a preliminary text of remarks he is planning to deliver in a message to be broadcast Thursday -- Christmas Day -- on British TV. The fiery Iranian leader, who has angered Western countries with his sharp comments on Israel, nuclear power, and the role of the United States in the world, will be delivering the Alternative Christmas Message on Britain's Channel 4. The network, which calls the event a ""traditional alternative to The Queen's Christmas Day broadcast,"" issued the preliminary text. The thrust of his words and the overall message contained religiously inclusive rhetoric, such as his congratulating ""the followers of Abrahamic faiths, especially the followers of Jesus Christ, and the people of Britain."" And his words conjured a hopeful future. But some of his remarks reflected Ahmadinejad's trademark bluntness. ""If Christ was on earth today undoubtedly he would stand with the people in opposition to bullying, ill-tempered and expansionist powers,"" the text says. ""If Christ was on earth today undoubtedly he would hoist the banner of justice and love for humanity to oppose warmongers, occupiers, terrorists and bullies the world over. ""If Christ was on earth today undoubtedly he would fight against the tyrannical policies of prevailing global economic and political systems, as he did in his lifetime."" The alternative address tradition, which began in 1993, has included remarks from the Rev. Jesse Jackson, an injured Afghan war veteran, a survivor of the attacks of September 11, 2001, and Marge from the television show ""The Simpsons."" The network notes that ""relations between Iran and the West"" will play ""a central role in world affairs"" in the coming year. The address -- which won't be broadcast opposite the queen's message -- will be preceded by a ""short introduction"" that will put the leader's ""appearance in context."" ""As the leader of one of the most powerful states in the Middle East, President Ahmadinejad's views are enormously influential. As we approach a critical time in international relations, we are offering our viewers an insight into an alternative world view,"" said Dorothy Byrne, head of news and current affairs.

"(CNN) -- Four-time European kings Barcelona gave Champions League wannabes Manchester City a heavy dose of reality when winning 2-0 at the Etihad on Tuesday. The victory in the first leg of their Last 16 clash was one of two impressive away performances as French side Paris Saint-Germain thumped Bayer Leverkusen 4-0 in Germany. Both Barcelona and PSG will now be strongly fancied to make April's quarterfinals. The buildup to the City-Barca game had been notable for comments made by Chelsea coach Jose Mourinho, formerly in charge of Real Madrid, who said Barcelona had their worst team for ""many years."" Nonetheless, they still fielded players of the caliber of Messi, Xavi, Andres Iniesta, Alexis Sanchez and Cesc Fabregas, with Neymar -- who is returning from injury -- on the bench. Former Arsenal man Fabregas was in no doubt that his team had delivered a reminder of their qualities in Manchester. ""We are top of the league, we had a great result tonight and we are in the final of the Spanish Cup -- there is nothing more you can ask for,"" said the 26-year-old. ""Maybe we had to prove a point in a way but we did it -- and we did it in style. ""Some people have been talking a bit too much, as usual, and hopefully this might have to shut up for a few days."" After a lacklustre first half, Barca took the lead through a Lionel Messi penalty earned after City's Martin Demichelis had been shown the red card for a professional foul. Despite playing with ten men for 37 minutes, City had their moments to equalize -- notably through a David Silva volley -- but they were underdone by a sucker punch when Dani Alves doubled the visitors' lead late on. The result means Manuel Pellegrini's side must score at least twice in the Camp Nou to have any chance of progress. Barcelona knocked out PSG in the quarterfinals last season but the French side have been in ominous form in recent weeks and turned the screw on hosts Leverkusen from the third minute. ""Tonight, we re-found our collective power, as if it was at the beginning of the season,"" PSG coach Laurent Blanc told French TV station Canal Plus. ""You may point out Bayer's weakness but I would rather note the PSG performance tonight. We played as a great team, both individually and collectively. ""The squad is in a very, very good state of mind and I also want to congratulate those who came off the bench. ""I really have many options to make my starting line-up, everyone is motivated and focused."" Despite lying second in the Germany Bundesliga, Leverkusen have been in poor form, having lost five of their last seven games. They got off to the worst start possible when captain Simon Rolfes ceded possession to Blaise Matuidi who slotted home moments later after a neat exchange of passes. With a fair degree of inevitability, Zlatan Ibrahimovic then took center stage. Three minutes after converting a penalty, the Swede fired home a stunning long-range effort to give his side a 3-0 halftime lead. His brace takes him to 10 goals in the Champions League, one more than Cristiano Ronaldo whose Real Madrid side don't play Schalke until next week. Like Manchester City, Leverkusen were also reduced to ten men as defender Emic Spahic, who had conceded the penalty earlier, was sent off in the 59th minute. Yet PSG only scored once more after that as new signing Yohan Cabaye, who joined the club from Newcastle United last month, capped the scoring two minutes from time. ""We lost heart, we were too nervous,"" shell-shocked defender Omer Toprak told Sky Sport Deutschland. ""They walked all over us. It was a shame for the fans."" On Wednesday, the next two matches of a staggered Last 16 phase take place when Arsenal host defending champions Bayern Munich and Atletico Madrid travel to seven-time winners AC Milan.","Barcelona and PSG take major strides towards Champions League quarterfinals .

"(CNN) -- Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy stormed to a seven-under round of 63 in the opening round of the Honda Classic at Florida's PGA National on Thursday. The world No. 8, who dramatically pulled out of the tournament following a disastrous start to his second round 12 months ago, produced a bogey-free round to finish one shot clear of America's Russell Henley. McIlroy, who is looking to repeat his 2012 success at Palm Beach Gardens, came home in just 30 strokes aided by back-to-back birdies at the closing two holes. South Africa's Rory Sabbatini, William McGirt from the U.S. and Wales' Jamie Donaldson are tied for third place after each shot opening rounds of 65. Read more: Latest leaderboard .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- With the Shenzhou-9 touching down in China Friday, expect the inevitable wave of propaganda touting its ""model"" citizens and scientific might. And what a mighty week it has been. China has witnessed the return of a manned spacecraft that successfully docked with the Tiangong 1 space lab -- a first for the nation. China is also still on a high after the deep-sea diving record set on Sunday by a Chinese manned submersible in the Pacific Ocean's Mariana Trench. China hails sea and space exploits . And while China's achievements in sea and space are impressive, do they stir more than just national pride? The Shenzhou-9 may be a stellar status symbol for Beijing but is it awakening a real hunger for adventure among the Chinese people? According to Chinese explorer Wong How Man, the answer is an emphatic yes. ""We're in space... not just making cellphones,"" he told CNN. China sends first female astronaut to space . As the President of the China Exploration and Research Society, Wong has been leading expeditions in China since he founded the group in 1986. In June 2005, he discovered the new source of the mighty Yangtze River. The veteran explorer said China's landmark journeys in recent years have shored up not only national pride but an individual desire to venture forth. Chinese space capsule returns to Earth . ""On a grassroots level, there's this huge urge to explore our own vast country,"" he said. Yunnan native Mei Zhang has seen that curiosity first-hand as the founder of WildChina, a Beijing-based company that offers off-the-beaten-track travel experiences. She claimed a spirit of adventure is very much alive, as traditional values that may have limited exploration take a backseat. Zhang cited one traditional Chinese saying in particular: ""Fu mu zai, bu yuan xing,"" or -- roughly translated -- ""When your parents are around, don't travel far away."" ""The first virtue was to be ""xiao,"" or filial to your parents,"" said Zhang. ""And that held back a lot of people and they stayed home. But with the internet, young people now see the world and say, 'Wow... why can't I do that?'"" She pointed to Chinese polar explorer Yuan Xiao as the ultimate ""unfilial"" son. Shanghai born and bred, Xiao left a 10-year career in banking to explore the world. He's one of the first Chinese to have navigated both the North and South Poles -- where he went to climb, ski and even scuba dive. And yet, ""China's bravest adventurer"" pointed out that he's not that unique. ""Zheng He, Zhang Qian, and the monk in Journey to the West... the Chinese have always been adventurous for different reasons,"" he said. ""The spirit has always been there.""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A bitter legal dispute between Michael Jackson's estate and a business partner of the late pop icon's mother was settled Tuesday, just before a trial on the matter was to begin, lawyers said. In the end, the lawyer for Katherine Jackson, who was not a party to the lawsuit, mediated the agreement, which gives the estate $2.5 million from the several companies involved. A federal judge had already ruled that Howard Mann and several associated companies violated Jackson's copyrights, which are controlled by his estate executors, and the only question for a jury was how much should be paid in damages. ""In light of the court's rulings for the estate on summary judgment, this settlement seems appropriate for all concerned,"" estate lawyers Howard Weitzman and Zia Modabber said in a statement to CNN on Tuesday. Mann's company published Katherine Jackson's 150-page coffee table book ""Never Can Say Goodbye, The Katherine Jackson Story"" two years ago and established a website -- MichaelJacksonSecretVault.com -- that the estate argued illegally used Jackson's images and lyrics. ""This was a long, complex and difficult litigation that in the end will likely be equitable for Mrs. Jackson and the other parties involved,"" Mann said. ""This settlement would not have been possible without Perry Sanders (Katherine Jackson's lawyer), who worked to bridge quite a distance."" ""I really really appreciated the reasonableness of all parties involved, and everyone is served well by getting this wrapped up,"" said Sanders, who helped mediate the settlement this week. The resolution of the dispute represents a new twist in the contentious relationship between the executors who control Michael Jackson's estate and the members of the Jackson family and some of their business associates. E-mails show promoter's doubts before Michael Jackson's death . Mann's involvement with the Jacksons began when he partnered with Henry Vaccaro, who bought a large amount of Jackson memorabilia purchased at an auction after Katherine and Joe Jackson's 1999 bankruptcy. A lien will be placed on those photos and other assets until a portion of the settlement is paid, a lawyer said. Katherine Jackson was not a defendant, but her name and those of her husband, Joe Jackson, and children Janet, Randy, Tito and Jermaine Jackson were on the defense witness list. The estate accused Mann of ""wholesale misappropriation"" of Michael Jackson copyrights and acting with ""arrogant disregard"" for the estate's rights by using unauthorized images . While the estate claimed the book sold about 25,000 copies for $1.5 million in the first two days, Mann's lawyers contended ""actual sales are very minimal and the defendant's businesses have suffered a major net loss."" The copyright violations also included screen shots from the ""This Is It"" documentary about the singer's last days and other ""misappropriated"" images, including Jackson's ""Smooth Criminal Lean,"" which Mann's company used in its corporate logo. Mann's website, which the judge already ordered to be taken offline, ""does absolutely everything in its power to suggest to its visitors that it is the hub for all things Michael Jackson, and that it is sanctioned and supported by the estate, when in fact it is neither,"" the estate argued.","Companies involved agree to pay the estate $2.5 million for copyright violations .

"(CNN) -- On Tuesday afternoon, the New York Times website experienced wide outage for several hours. Who has the nerve and ability to take down one of the most iconic newspapers in the world? The Syrian Electronic Army, which is loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, takes responsibility for the hack. This is not the first time the Syrian Electronic Army has attacked news organizations. The Washington Post, AP and others have been targeted in recent months as well. If the New York Times saw Syrian activists spray-painting slogans on its building, it could summon the minions of the law to detain them. But if you live far away in a place where American law does not apply, you are safe. It does not take much skill to intrude in cyberspace, and you can find free tools on the Internet that will let you stage a protest or an attack. When you log on to the Internet, you can send packets of digital data around the world in seconds. The speed of global connectivity gives the illusion that there are no borders. But this is not true. There are borders in cyberspace, they are just badly defended. The combination of high speeds, global reach and weak defenses means that someone sitting in Damascus or Tehran can take action in New York or Australia as easily as they could against the building across the street -- perhaps even easier as they won't have to leave their chair. The Syrian Electronic Army's attacks are a form of protest against Western media's portrayal of the Assad regime. Most experts think the Syrian Electronic Army is not the Syrian government, but ""patriotic hackers"" who support it. This makes them harder to control and harder to find. The Syrian Electronic Army takes public diplomacy to a new level, letting individuals make their voices known on issues as easily as a government. What we have seen from the Syrian Electronic Army is political action and sometimes political theater. Hacker groups like Anonymous, WikiLeaks or the Syrian Electronic Army have a symbiotic relationship with media that helps turn minor exploits into front-page news. The Syrian Electronic Army likes to go after the media because this is one way to make sure your message is heard. The Syrian Electronic Army's message to the Western media is one of scorn, ridicule and belittlement. This week's attack showed more skill than earlier episodes. It resembled a cyber attack made by Iran against dissidents in 2011. Perhaps the Iranians are helping the SEA in cyberspace, but it's more likely that they provided inspiration. The Syrian Electronic Army broke into the Australian company that hosts The Times' website (called a registrar) and changed its Internet addresses. This redirection was invisible to users who tried to visit NYTimes.com -- they either couldn't connect or were sent to another website controlled by the Syrians. The hackers got inside the target network and made some fundamental changes to how it worked. Some security experts have pointed out that The Times made its own networks vulnerable because of a ""misstep"" and as a result its website was easier to hack. So far, the Syrian Electronic Army's actions have been embarrassing rather than damaging. The attackers probably don't know how to carry out a more destructive attack. But with time they could easily learn. The Syrian Electronic Army's hacking won't change the outcome of the conflict in Syria (whatever that will be), but we don't want to discount the political effect of their actions. Some audiences in the Middle East likely enjoy seeing Western institutions humbled, and the Syrian Electronic Army is helping to dispel a sense of powerlessness against the Western behemoth. It boosts morale. We also don't want to discount the risks. If the Syrian Electronic Army can slip by feeble defenses to make fun of the media, someone else might be able to get in and cause more serious disruption. There are a lot of reasons why the Syrian Electronic Army might choose not to launch this kind of crippling cyber attack, but the strength of our defense isn't one of them. There are things that companies can do to protect themselves. Australia's Signals Directorate, the equivalent of NSA, has a list of mitigation strategies that would have block most of the Syrian Electronic Army does, but they aren't well known in the U.S. The global Internet brings tremendous, benefit but the threats are growing faster than our defenses. It's a vulnerable place with few rules. Until this is changed, hacks on The New York Times and others will be the norm, not the exception. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of James Lewis.","On Tuesday afternoon, the New York Times website went down for several hours .

"Washington (CNN) -- Under fire about disclosures of broad National Security Agency snooping on global leaders, President Barack Obama is offering a two-pronged response: You do it, too, and we'll make some changes. Thousands of documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden have portrayed the vast reach of U.S. surveillance activities, keeping tabs not only on U.S. call data but also global Internet and e-mail traffic. Germany to send intelligence officers to U.S. But Snowden's NSA documents, published recently in the Guardian, Der Spiegel and other publications, also describe spying on foreign leaders and that has now complicated U.S. diplomacy, the Obama administration acknowledges. Lisa Monaco, Obama's homeland security and counterterrorism adviser, said in an op-ed published in USA Today that the president ordered a review of surveillance programs ""including with respect to our foreign partners. We want to ensure we are collecting information because we need it and not just because we can."" It's not clear what changes will come from the review and even if they'll be made public. These programs are, after all, secret. Or they were before the Snowden disclosures. U.S. ambassadors in Europe and Latin America have been summoned by host countries to be scolded about the spying revelations. On Friday, European leaders ended an EU summit in Brussels with a stern warning to the United States about the spying activities: ""A lack of trust could prejudice the necessary cooperation."" The EU leaders didn't mention curtailing any spying activities directed at the United States or elsewhere. Among the leaders in the European response is Angela Merkel, the German leader who is in talks to form a coalition government following elections. Merkel called Obama and raised the sensitivities of Germans related to government spying, because of the activities of the former East Germany's Stasi. White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters that the United States understands the sensitivities but defended the activities. ""There are real threats out there against the American people and against our allies, including Germany, including allies around Europe and around the world,"" he said. The spying activity is part of what's expected around the world, U.S. and foreign officials say. For years, U.S. government officials have been required to leave behind their laptops and phones when they travel to China, Russia and Israel, U.S. officials say. To thwart expected spying they bring specially formatted devices, the officials say. A former senior U.S. counterintelligence official says the United States contends with economic spying from allies, including France, Israel and South Korea. China and Russia remain the top countries with spying operations in the United States. In the 1990s, former French spy chief Pierre Marion acknowledged the activity. In a U.S. diplomatic cable obtained by WikiLeaks and published in the Norwegian newspaper Aftonposten, Berry Smutny, an official with the German satellite company OHB Technology, is quoted as saying: ""France is the evil empire (in) stealing technology, and Germany knows this."" France was among the countries who summoned its U.S. ambassador to protest the reported NSA activities. Former Mexican president Vicente Fox, speaking to Spanish-language media during a visit this week, expressed surprise that his country's current president, Enrique Pena Nieto, had protested spying by the NSA. ""There's nothing new about the existence of spying by every government in the world, including Mexico,"" he said, dismissing any offense taken by Mexican authorities. He said he knew as president that he was being spied on by the United States. But he also recalled that Mexican spies had him under surveillance when he was running for president in 2000. One Latin American ambassador told CNN this week that he wasn't surprised at the reported NSA snooping activities, because all governments spy. But he was astonished at the scale, which he attributes to the money and technical abilities of the United States. ""They do it because they can,"" the ambassador says. ""My country doesn't do it because we don't have that kind of money and we don't have the technology."" Stewart Baker, a former senior U.S. homeland security official in the Bush administration, says the outrage in Europe appears to ignore the scale of hacking from China, most of it believed to be state-sponsored. ""The difference is the Chinese have never leaked documents,"" he said. He also noted that protests by Merkel now are different from 2007 when the German leader traveled to China shortly after revelations that Chinese hackers had infiltrated German computer networks. News accounts then said only that Merkel smiled as she met Chinese leaders. ""When she had a chance of take on some real communists for hacking into her computer, she swallowed her objections,"" Baker said.","Obama orders review of surveillance programs after disclosures of allies snooping on allies .

"(CNN) -- An Eastern European gang of hackers bent on stealing company secrets was responsible for recent attacks on Apple, Facebook and Twitter as well as dozens of other less-publicized hacks, according to new reports. Two unnamed ""people familiar with the matter"" told Bloomberg that the hackers appeared to be looking for research, intellectual property or other private information that they can sell on the underground market. Apple confirmed Tuesday that some of its employees' computers had been compromised after they visited a hacked website for iPhone developers. That site exploited a vulnerability in the Java browser plug-in. Weeks earlier, Facebook said that some of its computers were also compromised after employees visited a developer site. Both Facebook and Apple said no user data were accessed in the attacks. Earlier in January, Twitter said it, too, was attacked and that about 250,000 user accounts may have been compromised, with names and e-mails possibly being uncovered. As news of the intrusions spread, suspicions turned toward hackers in China. The nation's government denies it supports hacking. But experts said it wouldn't be surprising if the attacks originated in Eastern Europe instead. ""We've all been watching China, but they're not the most advanced cybercriminals,"" said Tom Kellermann, the former commissioner of President Barack Obama's cybersecurity council and head of security at Trend Micro. ""The most advanced are from the Eastern Bloc and Russia."" Kellermann said that a ""giant arms bazaar"" has developed in Eastern Europe by which criminals sell cybertools to others. That way, he said, organized crime elements and even terror groups end up with the same kind of advanced tools some governments possess. ""That's what I'm most worried about,"" Kellermann said. ""I wish this stuff were just nation-state on nation-state, so then we could crank up our diplomacy. But regimes don't have a monopoly on Big Brother, and they don't have a monopoly on cyber capabilities."" The recent hacks appear to have used what cybersecurity experts call a ""water hole"" attack. Like a lion waiting for those speedy gazelles to slow down and have a drink, criminals hack and load viruses onto sites they suspect attractive targets will visit, then wait. They don't know exactly who their victims will be. But once the victims are infected, the hackers can follow them back to their own businesses' networks to snoop around. One site used in the attacks appears to be called iPhone Dev SDK, a forum for developers who work with Apple's mobile operating system. ""iPhoneDevSDK has learned it was used as part of an attack whose victims included large Internet companies,"" read a message at the top of the site's home page Wednesday. ""We have no reason to believe user data (were) compromised, but to be safe, we've reset all user passwords."" Security holes in Oracle's Java programming language have been responsible for a number of the recent attacks. The Department of Homeland Security released a warning about the software in January. Apple pointed out in its statement that Macs running the most recent operating system, OS X Lion, have not come with Java pre-installed and that the computers automatically disable the plug-in after 35 days of inactivity. CNNMoney's David Goldman contributed to this report.","Cybersecurity expert says most savvy Web crime originates in Eastern Europe .

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- At the Iron Market, Haitians shopped for everything from vegetables to Voodoo flags. One side was destroyed in a 2008 fire. The January 12 earthquake leveled the rest. By year's end, workers hope to restore the Port-au-Prince landmark to its original splendor. Destined for Egypt in 1889, the market's French-built minarets became Haiti's when the sale to a Cairo train station fell through and President Florvil Hyppolite bought the massive cast iron structures as part of his plan to modernize the city. It is the post-earthquake project that most excites Michael Gay, a Port-au-Prince engineer and co-owner of Haiti's largest supplier of concrete. It's inspiring to see the historical structure rise again amid the rubble, Gay said. But even more, the Iron Market restoration provides hope to those who live and work in its shadow -- especially because everyone knows Haiti's rebuilding process is sure to be slow. By some estimates, it will take three to five years just to clear the rubble and debris still on the streets of Port-au-Prince. There is so much damage and destruction, so few trucks and places to dispose of the mangled steel and concrete and the piles of crushed furniture and personal possessions. The government plans to begin the reconstruction phase of the recovery process late this summer with some of the almost $10 billion pledged at a March donor conference. Haitians say they intend to build differently than they did before the earthquake. The government, awakened to the nation's construction follies, says it plans to crack down to ensure proper materials and techniques. 'We have to change' ""The government has no administrative control on building projects here (i.e. no building code to follow or building permits to take out), so when the Haitians and the outside world ask why did this disaster happen, what can anybody say?""A Canadian structural engineer entered this web post about his trip to Haiti after the earthquake. Engineers agree there are no excuses for the shoddy building that took place in Haiti. ""We're in the state we're in because of one thing, because of poor construction practices,"" said Gay, who heads GDG Concrete and Construction. ""We have to change. I've been saying it for more than 10 years."" Too many people suffered in the earthquake. If nothing else, Gay said he hopes fear will now serve as a guiding factor. Gay's firm built the U.S. Embassy here, as well as telecommunications firm Digicel's glass tower and other structures that withstood the earthquake. But without government regulation, enforced building codes and mandatory inspections, much of the rest of Haiti built as it pleased: cheaply. Gay said concrete and cement companies used sand containing calcium carbonate, a ""recipe for disaster,"" or diluted the strength of the cement with too much water, a cost-saving measure. Steel rebar was smooth, not marked with ridges as it is in the United States, which helps lock concrete in place. Only four bars of steel were used for every column, not eight as in America, . Haitians did the minimum to raise a building, said Georgia Tech engineering professor Reginald DesRoches. Forget about withstanding a magnitude-7.0 earthquake. DesRoches, who has been making periodic trips to Haiti to help assess damage, said complicating Haiti's rebuilding is that structures have to be both earthquake- and hurricane-resistant. The former requires heavy, solid construction; the latter requires reinforcement and malleability. ""A small difference in technique can make a huge difference, DesRoches said. But ultimately ""it's about changing the whole culture of building."" Gay agreed. Thankfully, he said, there isn't anyone left in Haiti who doesn't feel accountable. ""The problem is that there was never any incentive to do it properly. The government has to do its job."" For the first time, the government intends to inspect new construction. It is requiring permits of those who want to repair damaged houses that have been marked as salvageable by the Ministry of Public Works, Transport and Communications. Inspectors have even stopped some questionable reconstruction projects. It is also working with foreign experts to train Haitian engineers and masons; to make sure the nation has the skill set to build wisely. The Department of Public Works partnered with well-known American structural engineer Kit Miyamoto to train engineers. Already, 500 have been trained, according to Leslie Voltaire, a member of the government's reconstruction committee. Miyamoto said the biggest challenge has been the sheer number of damaged buildings. So far, he said, about 70,000 have been assessed. ""We need to come up with a unique strategic idea to deal with hundreds of thousands of structures to be repaired and reconstructed,"" he said. ""It may take some time but they will get there."" The sound of hammers and saws . Construction issues and messy post-earthquake land disputes could slow the rebuilding effort. But with the urgent need for sound housing, some aid agencies have begun to construct transitional homes for thousands of Haitians facing a potentially violent rainy season without a roof over their heads. Some already have permanent materials; others can later be reinforced. Plans call for thousands of these tiny homes to dot the landscape. They go up quickly and relatively cheaply, and are not subject to complex building codes and inspections. The noise of hammers and saws can be heard outside Port-au-Prince, in places like Cabaret and in Leogane, where land was available to build. Joseph Sanon oversees 45 carpenters for Habitat for Humanity. They are constructing plywood and corrugated tin shelters near Cabaret, on empty fields lined by watermelon crops and crimson hibiscus. The Habitat houses consist of nine wooden posts rooted in buckets of concrete that can be removed later if necessary. The heavy-duty tarps that wrap around the posts can one day be replaced by more permanent materials, including concrete. In the near future, Habitat is planning to build 1,000 such homes near Cabaret and another 1,000 in hard-hit Leogane to the west, said Habitat's Ken Meinert. For Blanc Voltaire, the small one-room house is a gift from God, the only bright spot in the four months since the quake. He proudly showed it off. It was clean. Orderly. A carved wooden china cabinet was filled with ceramic cups and dishes. The bed was dressed in crisp white linens. It was a far cry from the forlorn tin shack across the yard. That's where he used to sleep with his wife and four children. He put his hand to his calf to show how high the water rose when it rained. Voltaire said he is thankful for a proper roof over his children's heads. He knows he is among the lucky ones. ""The demand is so high here,"" Habitat's Sanon said. ""There is someone asking for a house every minute."" In Leogane, an American missionary group helped put up neat rows of pre-fabricated compressed wood huts. In each was a dining table, chairs, a bed -- a semblance of normalcy for those left with nothing. Above the door in every house was a wooden placard that said, in Creole: ""Bondye Beni Lakay Nou."" God bless this house.","Reconstruction phase of Haiti's recovery begins this summer .

"(CNN) -- Behind every great woman -- is another great woman. Gabby Douglas' success at last year's London Olympics catapulted her to fame, fortune and glory. The first black woman of any nationality to win gold in the individual all-around gymnastics event, the teenager was hailed as the face of progress, an all-American star and the nation's newest celebrity. But that is just the tip of a story which takes in divorce, financial peril, racism and a mother's fight to give her daughter the opportunity she so badly craved. Fighter . Natalie Hawkins may not be as limber and supple as her teenage daughter, but nobody can doubt her strength. ""My mom has influenced me so much,"" Douglas told CNN's ""An Uneven Playing Field"" documentary. ""She's taught me how to be a fighter and I love her so much. I don't know if this journey could be possible without her by my side supporting me."" Douglas' battle to become an Olympic champion began at the age of six when she began to copy the moves of her older sister, Arielle. Inspired by watching Dominique Dawes, the first African American gymnast to ever qualify and compete in an Olympic Games, Douglas set her heart on emulating her heroine. Along with her mother, Dawes provided another strong role model during a difficult childhood where Douglas' parents divorced and money was scarce. ""I loved Dominique Dawes,"" Douglas said of the 1996 Atlanta gold medalist. ""We did a couple of events together and she's just a such a joy to be around. She inspired me to do bigger and better things. ""I find that funny now because I remember when I was younger and I looked up to my role models. But now the tables have turned and I'm the role model. But I love it. ""I love girls, parents, whoever it may be, coming up to me and saying, 'You inspire my daughter.' "" Struggle . The 17-year-old is aware that life will never be the same following her performances in London -- having overcome difficult circumstances, she is now a bankable star. One of four children at home, her gymnastics was at the heart of the family, with her mom supporting her financially at every opportunity. Even when Hawkins suffered a negative reaction to prescription medication and was forced to leave her job at a bank in 2009, she managed to find a way to support her daughter. While Douglas' father Timothy remained a stranger for much of her childhood, Hawkins was there when it mattered, especially once her daughter became a global superstar. But protecting Gabby -- nicknamed ""the Flying Squirrel"" due to her acrobatics -- from wider attention was quite a different proposition. In a world where social media presents an instant opportunity for people to make a judgment, Douglas found out the hard way when Twitter went berserk with criticism of her hair style. It was an episode which infuriated Hawkins, who was left bewildered by the abuse at her daughter. What it did do, however, was add further backing to Douglas' assertion that female gymnasts are at a far higher risk of criticism than their male counterparts every time they wander into the arena. Strength . ""Us women have to do a lot more than the men,"" said Douglas reflecting on the criticism. ""We've got our hair and makeup to do. The men can just go out there but we have to get ready. ""When we're looking spot-on nobody even notices. They just say, 'Oh, she looks good,' but when you look horrible then everyone is like, 'Whoosh.' ""You just handle it and be yourself. You don't want to let people tear you down. You just kind of make a joke out of it, laugh at it. ""There's always the next time, always another awards show red carpet that we can look fabulous at. You've just got to learn from it and be yourself; don't focus on the negative comments. I want to just focus on the positive."" The gold medals soon silenced those trolling Douglas online, with her achievements transforming her from a potential star to a global superstar. But her journey to the very top was a long and often arduous route, taking Douglas away from the comforts of home and family. From the age of eight, she trained at Excalibur Gymnastics in Virginia Beach -- a club which had provided the U.S. national team with 10 members since 1995. So intense was her schedule that she was forced to undergo home schooling while her mother worked nights to provide extra funds for the tuition. It was there that she began to blossom, winning national titles and competing on the international stage as she began to show glimpses of what was to come. But Douglas' relationship with her coaches began to deteriorate following a wrist injury in 2009. Mocked . It was a tough time for the teenager, who in the past has spoken about how she was mercilessly mocked both for her appearance and her race by fellow teammates. The combination proved too much for both Douglas and Hawkins, who decided that the future lay away from Virginia and in Des Moines, Iowa. For the first time, Douglas would be away from the woman who had inspired her and fought for her opportunity to pursue her dream. It was a difficult time for the youngster, who moved in with a host family in Iowa -- the Partons. ""At first I was really excited,"" Douglas recalled. ""I was ready to take on the journey but my mom and sister came with me for a week and when they left I was just miserable. ""I was so sad leaving my family. I had a time where I said that I needed to suck it up and put on my big girl pants. ""This was my decision. I knew I had to go to the gym and work very hard, because I think in the gym I was kind of giving up a little too. I decided to push myself."" Dreams . And push she did -- both mentally and physically, Douglas began to reach the heights of which she had only dreamed years earlier. Working under the gaze of Chinese coach Liang Chow, the man who helped Shawn Johnson win gold at Beijing in 2008, Douglas spent four to five hours in the gym every day. It was a grueling workload, with Douglas adapting to the Chinese method of coaching rather than the technique she picked up in her formative years in Virginia. ""It is a bit different, but I love Chow's style,"" she said. ""He corrected my technique and the quality of my gymnastics, and him and his wife Li have shaped me up into this amazing gymnast in a year and a half."" Champion . The hard work has certainly paid off. Gold on the uneven bars at the 2010 Pan American Championships catapulted Douglas into the limelight before she took silver in the beam at the U.S. Junior nationals. She was part of the U.S. team which won gold at the 2011 World Championships before a stellar 2012 placed her at the forefront of the national consciousness. Four gold medals, one silver and one bronze all arrived within 12 months before Douglas produced a magnificent exhibition at the U.S. Team Trials to win the all-around competition. Alongside Jordyn Wieber, Aly Raisman, McKayla Maroney and Kyla Ross, Douglas helped the U.S. women's team win gold in London -- the first time the nation had triumphed in female gymnastics since that team including Dawes in 1996. The team, dubbed the ""Fierce Five,"" brought a zest and flair to the Games which captured the imagination of gymnastics fans not just in London but across the world. ""We had this girl power,"" Douglas recalls. ""We just said, 'Let's be sassy,' and we bonded really well, meshed together and it was amazing. ""I think people should definitely be paying attention to women's sport because we can do a lot of things. ""We're very powerful, strong minded and whenever we want something, we go out there and fight. I definitely think people should pay more attention."" Celebrity . Douglas has had no shortage of attention following those triumphs. Now she is one of the most instantly recognizable figures in U.S. sport, hosting awards nights, speaking at events for kids and modeling on the catwalk. Sponsors have quickly realized the value of Douglas' success -- Kelloggs, Nintendo and Procter & Gamble are among the firms to have signed deals with her. ""It's very fun,"" said Douglas about her new-found lifestyle in front of the camera. ""I love doing photo shoots and commercials, it's really fun. They like to keep it exciting with a lot of energy. I have a blast doing all this stuff. ""But with the whole fame thing, I just try to take it one step at a time. It can be difficult to handle everything at once with celebrity, the gym and school. ""So when I'm at school I think about school, when I'm at the gym I think about the gym and when I'm outside and traveling I think about that. I don't like to cram myself with everything."" Role model . Young she might be, but Douglas is wise beyond her years. Aware of her influence on her peers and younger following, she is as keen as ever to inspire those who seek to replicate her success. Whether it be by hosting kids' awards, motivational speaking or just taking time to sign autographs, this is one woman who is desperate to make a difference. ""I have this platform and I love using it,"" she added. ""Some girls or moms come up to me and say, 'You inspire my daughter,' or 'Gabby, you've inspired me to do great things.' ""I just want to help them believe in themselves and I want them to know that anything is possible if you set your mind to it.""","Gabby Douglas was a double Olympic gold medalist at London 2012 .

"(CNN) -- A former U.S. soldier could face the death penalty after being convicted of raping a 14-year-old Iraqi girl and killing her and her family. Former U.S. soldier Steven Green has been convicted of raping and killing a 14-year-old Iraqi girl. Steven Green of Midland, Texas, was found guilty Thursday in U.S. District Court in Paducah, Kentucky, said court spokeswoman Vanessa Armstrong. She said the penalty phase of the trial begins Monday. Jurors deliberated for more than 10 hours before finding Green guilty of murder, rape, conspiracy and obstruction of justice, according to the court's Web site. Green, 23, was accused of leading a group of soldiers that committed the crimes in 2006 in the Mahmoudiya area, south of Baghdad. They killed the girl's father, mother and younger sister before raping and killing her and burning her body. Last year, then-Pfc. Jesse Spielman received a 110-year sentence in the case for felony murder, conspiracy to commit rape, rape and housebreaking with the intent to commit rape. Three other soldiers charged in the case received sentences ranging from 27 months to 100 years. The slayings became public in 2006, angering the Iraqi public and prompting demands from some Iraqi officials that American soldiers accused of crimes against civilians face prosecution in Iraqi courts. U.S. military and civilian officials condemned the attack and vowed to bring those responsible to justice. All the defendants were with the 502nd Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division, based in Fort Campbell, Kentucky. Spc. James Barker, one of the soldiers involved, told investigators that the soldiers were drinking whiskey, playing cards and hitting golf balls when Green brought up the idea of going to the house near the checkpoint where they were stationed to rape the girl. Barker described Green as persistent. The soldiers then allegedly changed into dark clothing and covered their faces before going to the house, investigators said.","Civilian court convicts former GI of murdering Iraqi family, raping girl .

"Johannesburg (CNN) -- With his murder trial approaching this March, South African Olympic runner Oscar Pistorius has hired some help from the United States to challenge the case against him. An American forensic team will give expert testimony to cast doubt on evidence entered against the athlete nicknamed the ""Blade Runner"" for the special prosthesis legs he sprints with, his spokeswoman Anneliese Burgess said Wednesday. The track star, whose legs are amputated below the knees, admitted to shooting dead model Reeva Steenkamp, in his home on Valetine's Day. But he has said it was an accident. Pistorius charged with premeditated murder in Steenkamp death . She was 29 when she died. The state has indicted him for pre-meditated murder, and he faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison, if convicted. Pistorius denies the charge and has said he mistook his girlfriend for a home invader when he fired shots from a pistol through a bathroom door that she was behind. Pistorius also was indicted for allegedly violating South Africa's firearms control act. Some 107 witnesses are to testify against him. The American forensics team, who Burgess would not identify, is already in South Africa and has met with Pistorius' legal team. In previous court appearances, Pistorius has often broken down crying and fought to maintain his composure. Before the start of proceedings he could be seen at times holding hands with relatives and praying. The first phase of the trial will take place in March, but the entire trial could take place at various times across a year or more because of potential motions and postponements along the way. Michael Steenkamp, the victim's uncle, said the model's family isn't focusing on Pistorius' guilt or innocence, and they will not attend any of the related court proceedings. The uncle said his faith has helped him forgive Pistorius. ""If I can't forgive him, and I have been forgiven, then that is our sin. And I very much asked the Lord to guide me before I got to Port Elizabeth when the tragedy happened ... that took a lot of pressure off my shoulders,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- It's the biggest move of his career and it's off the court. Jason Collins, who played with the NBA's Boston Celtics and Washington Wizards this season, has disclosed that he is gay, making him the first active openly gay male athlete in the four major American pro team sports. The center, who said he is now a free agent, made the disclosure in a column appearing in the upcoming issue of Sports Illustrated. ""I didn't set out to be the first openly gay athlete playing in a major American team sport. But since I am, I'm happy to start the conversation. I wish I wasn't the kid in the classroom raising his hand and saying, 'I'm different.' If I had my way, someone else would have already done this. Nobody has, which is why I'm raising my hand,"" he wrote. Collins also wrote that the killing of three people at the Boston Marathon persuaded him to make an announcement. Things can change in a moment, so why not start living more truthfully, he wrote. On Twitter, Collins thanked everyone who sent him messages of support. ""All the support I have received today is truly inspirational. I knew that I was choosing the road less traveled but I'm not walking it alone,"" he wrote. Sports Illustrated's managing editor said Collins was reticent about being a flag bearer. Spike Lee slams the Collins hate machine . ""It is a much simpler, more personal reason. He wants to have a family,"" Chris Stone told CNN. ""He wants the same life that his twin brother, Jarron, has. This is a secret he's kept for a very long time. He didn't even inform his brother that he was gay until late last summer. ... So much for twin telepathy."" Jarron, who played in the NBA for 10 seasons and was Jason's teammate at Stanford, tweeted to his brother: ""Very proud of you."" ""Jason Collins has forever changed the face of sports,"" said the Human Rights Campaign, a civil rights group fighting for gay rights. It likened the announcement to Jackie Robinson, the first African-American to play in major league baseball in the modern era. NBA's first openly gay player . ""At a time when millions are reflecting on the life and legacy of Jackie Robinson, Jason Collins is a hero for our own times,"" the group said. Former NBA player Charles Barkley, now an analyst for ""Inside the NBA"" on TNT, told CNN on Monday night that active players shouldn't be surprised that a teammate is gay. ""I think anybody who thinks they never played with a gay player is an idiot,"" he said on ""AC360."" ""I played with several gay players. It's their own business, and I think they should get to be who they want to be."" Collins is a 7-footer who has played with six NBA teams -- the Wizards, Celtics, Atlanta Hawks, Minnesota Timberwolves, Memphis Grizzlies and New Jersey Nets -- over the past 12 seasons. He has averaged 3.6 points and 3.8 rebounds in 713 career games, and he has had a great deal of playoff experience with the Nets (who have since moved to Brooklyn) and the Hawks. Momentum had been growing in recent months for an active player in the National Football League, National Hockey League, National Basketball Association or Major League Baseball to come out. Just a few weeks ago, the NHL announced a new program teaching tolerance and giving support to gay athletes. Commissioner Gary Bettman said the agreement made the NHL's policy of inclusiveness ""clear and unequivocal."" ""While we believe that our actions in the past have shown our support for the LGBT community, we are delighted to reaffirm through this joint venture with the NHL Players' Association that the official policy of the NHL is one of inclusion on the ice, in our locker rooms and in the stands,"" Bettman said in the joint statement with You Can Play. And NFL player Brendon Ayanbadejo, The New York Times reported, has been in contact with closeted players in several sports. ""What we're trying to facilitate is to get them together and do what they want to do, do what is right for them,"" he told the Times. Collins paves way for gay athletes . In February, former professional soccer player Robbie Rogers announced on his blog that he is gay. His former U.S. teammates showed solidarity in response to the news. Though reaction to Collins' announcement also was overwhelming support, not everyone had a positive response. ESPN basketball analyst Chris Broussard said the Bible calls homosexuality a sin. ""If you're openly living in unrepentant sin, whatever it may be, not just homosexuality, adultery, fornication, premarital sex between heterosexuals, whatever it may be. I think that's walking in open rebellion to God and to Jesus Christ,"" he said. NFL receiver Mike Wallace tweeted Monday: ""All these beautiful women in the world and guys wanna mess with other guys SMH."" He tweeted again, saying he was being misinterpreted. ""Never said anything was right or wrong I just said I don't understand!! Deeply sorry for anyone that I offended,"" he wrote. The Dolphins, Wallace's employer, issued a statement saying the team has spoken with Wallace about the tweets. The team said it will address its policy of inclusion with all of its players. NBA Commissioner David Stern said Collins, a 34-year-old veteran, is widely respected in the league. ""We are proud he has assumed the leadership mantle on this very important issue,"" he said in a statement. Washington Wizards President Ernie Grunfeld said the team is ""extremely proud of Jason and support his decision to live his life proudly and openly."" ""He has been a leader on and off the court and an outstanding teammate throughout his NBA career. Those qualities will continue to serve him both as a player and as a positive role model for others of all sexual orientations,"" Grunfeld said. Boston Celtics head coach Doc Rivers called Collins ""a pro's pro"" and one of his favorite players he ever coached. ""If you have learned anything from Jackie Robinson, it is that teammates are always the first to accept,"" Rivers said. ""It will be society who has to learn tolerance."" Bill Clinton called the announcement an ""important moment for professional sports and in the history of the LGBT community."" Clintons welcome announcement from friend Jason Collins . Collins, who had been traded by the Celtics to the Wizards this season, wrote in his essay that U.S. Rep. Joe Kennedy, D-Massachusetts, helped prompt his decision to come out as gay. Kennedy and Collins were roommates at Stanford. He recounts hearing about Kennedy, who is not gay, marching in Boston's Gay Pride Parade. ""For as long as I've known Jason Collins he has been defined by three things: his passion for the sport he loves, his unwavering integrity, and the biggest heart you will ever find,"" Kennedy said. ""I'm proud to stand with him today and proud to call him a friend."" President Barack Obama called Collins ""to express his support and said he was impressed by his courage,"" a White House official said. Active players posted their approval on Twitter. The Los Angeles Lakers' Kobe Bryant said: ""Proud of @jasoncollins34. Don't suffocate who u r because of the ignorance of others."" Steve Nash, also a Laker, said: ""The time has come. Maximum respect."" Two Wizards players, Garrett Temple and Bradley Beal, said in tweets they were ""proud"" of Collins. ""Much respect to my teammate,"" Temple said. ""Great teammate, mentor and better person,"" said Beal. Collins' announcement comes after the end of the Wizards' season, and he is no longer under contract. He is an ""old"" player by NBA standards who has never been a star. So will he play in the NBA this fall? ESPN.com said only six of 14 team officials reached for an unofficial poll Monday thought he would be back in the league. If he does return, he probably will play only a few minutes a game for a team that needs a veteran leader, the other executives told ESPN.com. Twitter reacts to the revelation . Some male athletes have come out as gay after they've left professional sports. One is John Amaechi, a former NBA player. Amaechi told CNN he hopes Collins will be a catalyst for a wider acceptance of openly gay athletes, saying he believes Collins is better equipped than anyone who came before him to handle the attention that will come his way. But it may take more, Amaechi said. People like to believe one iconic figure can change things, he said, ""but the reality is that when there's this tipping point, or enough people coming together deciding that change is necessary, that's when change happens."" The Women's National Basketball Association, the women's pro league, has had its share of milestones and openness as far as gays are concerned. In 2005, Sheryl Swoopes, a top player in the WNBA, announced she was gay. Brittney Griner, the No. 1 pick in this year's WNBA draft, recently said in an interview with Sports Illustrated that she is gay. Griner finished her college career as the NCAA's all-time leading shot-blocker with 748 and as the No. 2 all-time scorer with 3,283 points. Opinion: Openly gay player is not a distraction .

"Washington (CNN) -- The White House has been tight-lipped about how many uninsured Americans have signed up for health care insurance under the Affordable Care Act, which has led to some concerns about whether enough people are enrolling in private health plans to make the economic model work. Under the law, insurance companies are required to cover anyone. But in order to make that economically feasible, everyone has to buy insurance. The White House has set a goal of enrolling 7 million people in private insurance plans through the new health insurance exchanges by March 31, 2014, the end of the glitch-plagued open enrollment period that started October 1. But it has been tight-lipped so far about how many people have actually enrolled in private insurance plans -- those who have both applied and paid the premiums in advance. Officials announced Thursday that 700,000 people have applied for insurance plans in both the 36 states that are using a federally run health care exchange and the 14 states running their own exchanges. Obamacare website 'fixable' by end of November . But don't apply that 700,000 application figure to the 7 million enrollment goal. For starters, there's no guarantee that all 700,000 will ultimately enroll in a health insurance plan. And those 700,000 applications include Medicaid enrollments. Medicaid programs are the public health insurance programs run by states to provide low-income people with health insurance. As the law was originally envisioned, more than half of the uninsured people in the United States -- 24 million or so, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation -- who would be getting insurance through Obamacare would have been getting Medicaid. Anyone who makes less than 138% of the poverty level -- about $27,000 for a family of four -- isn't eligible for federal subsidies to buy insurance, so Medicaid is effectively their only option. So it's not necessarily a bad thing if more than half of the people getting insurance under Obamacare so far are getting Medicaid. But in many of the states operating their own exchanges, new Medicaid enrollees account for more than half of the people who have obtained insurance under Obamacare since October 1. Related: Finger-pointing over Obamacare . Should it be alarming that so many of these 700,000 new applications are people trying to get Medicaid and not private insurance? Not yet, said Matt Salo, executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors. ""There's nothing in what we've seen to suggest anything like that,"" he said. ""Whether you're able to be eligible for Medicaid or not is totally dependent on your income."" But he did admit ""Some of the numbers we've seen, preliminary, early numbers, do seem a little out of whack."" But he said there's a reason for that. ""In these small handful of states, they're aggressively targeting people they think might be eligible for Medicaid,"" Salo said. Salo pointed to people who the states already know are on food stamps receiving some other kind of state or locally funded health program. ""You know who they are, you know what their income is, you know they're OK accepting government benefits. If you go after these guys, there should be no surprise that these people are being enrolled."" Also, in some states, Medicaid coverage starts immediately, meaning there may be more of an incentive to enroll early because you get coverage sooner than on the private market where no matter when you enroll in the first two and a half months coverage still starts on January 1. In Arkansas they've insured more than 62,000 people in Medicaid since October 1. But in a novel twist they're doing it by using Medicaid dollars to buy people private insurance on the exchanges. Related: Obamacare more than a phone call away . And Oregon has been approved to use food stamps and other metrics as a prequalifier for Medicaid enrollment. So the state sent letters to uninsured welfare recipients that detailed simple steps to enroll in Medicaid -- i.e. just sign a form and mail it back or call a hotline. This has resulted in tens of thousands of enrollees. But Oregon also has yet to allow online registration for private health insurance. It's the one state that elected to fix the glitches in its website before going live. It may very well be that not enough people -- particularly the young and the healthy people who are needed to pay premiums to offset the benefits going out to older and less healthy -- are signing up for health insurance on the exchanges. But with so little information from the government, it is too early to tell. What we learned and didn't from Obamacare website hearing .","Early sign ups for the Affordable Care Act have lagged because of technical problems .
But those first numbers may mask a different set of numbers .
Many states are using Medicaid enrollees in their count toward initial Obamacare applications ."
"(CNN) -- Few things are worse for the traveler than nasty surprises. Yet we keep traveling. Not simply because we like to travel or because we must travel, but because we accept that the world is an imperfect place and the travel industry an imperfect business that likes, when possible, to get by on the bare minimum. Nevertheless, there are some fixes that could be implemented quickly and cheaply that would make travel much more pleasant for everyone. We seek neither the impractical (first-class leather seats in coach), the implausible (teleportation), nor the unrealistic (airport concourses that demand less walking than a breast cancer fund-raiser). Even better, none of the brainstorms below are protected by patents, licenses or other legal restrictions, so Big Travel can feel free to scoop them up and begin making our lives better right away. 1. Update hotel check-in times . In 1946, the Tote'm convenience-store chain extended its hours from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., announcing its groundbreaking move by changing its name to 7-Eleven. In 1974, the company now known as ACCEL/Exchange booted up the world's first 24-hour ATM network. In 2005, England and Wales ushered in the era of never-ending beer drinking by granting licenses allowing pubs to serve liquor round-the-clock. Yet as nonstop commerce has created a sleepless planet, hotels remain mired in conventions of the 1800s, when the steam train rolled in and out of town once each afternoon and again the following morning. With airlines cleaving away from the hub-and-spoke system -- which once rigidly controlled arrival and departure times -- in favor of more or less continuous schedules and red-eye flights, the hotel industry needs to restructure its own arrival and departure policies to reflect modern traffic flow. Few miseries compare to landing in a city at 6 a.m. only to while away the morning in traveler's purgatory awaiting an ""early"" 1 p.m. check-in that you had to grovel to get. The major hotel chain that figures out a way to implement ""anytime check-in"" on a mass scale will become the new Hilton. Unless, of course, Hilton gets to it first. 2. Invent a universal plug socket . A few years ago, tech-connected people lived in an era of many too gadgets and not enough laptop sockets, wondering why the hell devices couldn't just share the same plug-ins. Then someone invented the USB. The travel industry is suffering from a similar connection problem. Two thin pins in the United States; two round pins in Europe; three chunky pins in the United Kingdom; three even chunkier pins in India, with some smaller three-pins occasionally used for really old lamps. There are attempts to paper over this dilemma. But what if you're not lucky enough to be in a business hotel with a full 3x2 foot panel dedicated to a dozen types of plug shapes? What if you don't want to carry around three different personal plug adaptors that might work, if you're lucky? China has started to try to solve this problem, with some hotels employing single, all-purpose wall sockets able to accept various shapes and numbers of pins. Isn't it time everyone started doing the same? 3. Bring us the check . Introducing the future of good service -- the coffeecheck. Nothing spoils a meal like being held hostage to an uppity or lackadaisical waiter's notion of when you'll be allowed to leave the restaurant. Checks should be delivered with the final course, at least for businesses lunches. 4. Abolish institutionalized taxi extortion . One of the enduring mysteries of travel is the shocking percentage of municipalities that allow the first impression of their cities to be an extortionate US$65 cab ride from the airport to downtown. Does the Mafia run every taxi company in the world? Is it too much to ask that visitors to major cities be spared from getting fleeced as if they've concluded a losing transaction with a neighborhood bookie as soon as they get to town? Affordable rides into the city would eliminate a significant amount of the stress and hassle endured by visitors coming to a place for the first time. If private enterprise can't responsibly accommodate tourists, local legislation should be employed to force them into it. 5. Offer upgrades whenever possible . Airline upgrades are the Bigfoot of the travel world. People talk of them in hushed tones, with shrugged shoulders, their faces darkened in some corner of a rural tavern as they exchange secrets on how and where you might be able to score one. Surely this is ridiculous. We understand the consumer psychology behind premium-level status -- you start giving away your exclusive product and suddenly it's no longer exclusive. But while most consumer-facing industries like to improve customer experiences whenever possible, the airline industry seems to go out of its way to keep its passengers grumpy and miserable. The hotel industry is a little better. Taj Hotels has a policy of upgrading to the next level of room or suite if available when you check in. But for the most part hotels avoid upgrading, too, and we suggest at some cost. Wouldn't the word-of-mouth and social media praise be worth it from customers grateful for surprise upgrades if they occurred more often? 6. Retire the beverage cart on short flights . Responsible for more mashed toes and dislocated elbows than the UFC, these 300-pound chariots of doom present passengers in aisle seats with a constant danger, cost airlines millions and keep us from hitting the head at precisely the moment we most need to. To shave expenses, airlines have already done away with most food. The next logical step is ending the tiresome drink service that creates more trouble than it's worth. For flights of two hours or less, hand out bottles of water and sell beer, wine and drinks in the departure lounge. This will save the airlines money and labor and, for customers, eliminate the risk of being sideswiped every five minutes by the polyestered haunch of an exhausted flight attendant horsing a Sisyphun weight up and down the aisle taking drink requests and barking orders -- ""Keep your feet in!"" ""Watch your knees!"" -- with all the Ã©lan of the guy who sits in the booth and weighs you in at the dump. 7. Just stop talking, please . The first port of call for most vacations -- the airport -- is invariably an unending and un-ignorable procession of barely decipherable Tannoy announcements, most of which are entirely superfluous. Noise equals stress, so airports should be minimizing it wherever possible, not adding to it. We know by now to keep our luggage with us at all times, that airports are non-smoking areas and if you have had to call Mrs. Bawdwallah nine times to ""proceed immediately to gate number 12,"" it's safe to say she doesn't care or she isn't able. And while you're at it, how about upgrading those 1930s-quality public address systems in airports and on planes? 8. Eliminate the paper trail . Why do we need a tissue-thin napkin every time someone on an airplane hands us four ounces of water in a urine-sample cup? Former American Airlines chairman Robert Crandall once famously saved his company US$40,000 a year by eliminating the olive from salads the airline once served onboard. A small redwood forest could be recycled from the napkins airlines plow through each year. 9. Make booking more transparent . You think you've found the deal of a lifetime, till you click ""checkout"" and the price suddenly doubles due to the airport tax. Or you spot an airline ad for ""US$10 deals"" to the other side of the world, but you have to book on exactly the right day and on the right flight to take advantage and they don't mention when that is. A little transparency from the start would go a long way to making the booking process far better. 10. Give us our phones back . If you can get a 300-ton hunk of iron and aluminum into the sky, surely you can figure out a way for us to use our iPads without it causing a disaster?","Listen up, Big Travel! These fixes would make travel more pleasant for us and maybe save you money.
Do we really need a napkin every time someone hands us a drink?
Let us check into a hotel any time of day.
Upgrade the quality of public address systems in airports and on planes."
"Colorado Springs, Colorado (CNN) -- A high school gym erupts with cheers as the announcer introduces the women fighting to be the nation's top amateur boxers. Names like Esparza, Cruz and Estrada sound out over the PA system, as young Latinas with impressively defined arms take to the ring. The top four boxers who medaled at the National Championships in late June have a rare distinction this year: Women's boxing has been added to the 2012 Olympic Games in London. The traditionally male sport of boxing was the only summer sport at the Olympics without a female counterpart. The last great domain of men in sports is about to crumble, and a bunch of Latinas, flyweight boxers who tip the scales at no more than 112 pounds, are leading the way . The principal figure in this sport's revolution is Marlen Esparza, a 22-year-old Texan of Mexican descent who was already a five-time national champion in the flyweight division coming into this year's tournament. Esparza is aware that her success represents more than a personal victory. ""I feel like being a woman and Hispanic, and doing something well, would help us out as far as how people view us,"" says Esparza, whose success has drawn sponsors like Coke, Nike and Cover Girl. Boxing has been a huge sport in the Latino world for decades, producing some of the community's biggest stars, such as John ""The Quietman"" Ruiz, a Puerto Rican who defeated Evander Holyfield for the world heavyweight title in 2001. Some boxers say Latinos have a different boxing style that makes them stand out, always pushing forward and playing a strong mental game. ""We Latinas are natural fighters,"" says Raquel Ruiz, who is writing ""Punching for Gold,"" a book about the Olympic journey. ""We fight all our lives to get ahead. Some of us even grow up in the streets fighting with our fists. Boxing has always been a sport of Latino culture, and, like every other area, now the Latinas are taking it and owning it, making it our victory."" Esparza began fighting at 11 when she accompanied her brothers to a gym in Houston because her Mexican-born father, David, whose hero was Mexican boxing legend Julio César Chávez, wanted his boys to take up the sport. As it turned out, the Esparza boys hated boxing, but little Marlen begged their trainer, Rudy Silva, to coach her. He's a police officer who patrols a tough Houston high school, and Esparza, who was having disciplinary problems in school, was just the kind of kid he sought to help. But he couldn't see how a girl could fit into his all-male program. ""I tested her by boxing the boys, figuring she would get scared off,"" he remembers. ""Suddenly it was she who was testing them!"" Silva took her on and helped guide her to the sport's elite level. There are no shortcuts: It takes unbelievable dedication to withstand the punishing training regimen of a champion boxer. But at age 16, too young to qualify, Esparza sneaked into the national championships and won. Since then she has competed in the Pan American Games and the Women's World Boxing Championships. Her success has drawn other Latinas into boxing. ""If I make it to the Olympics it's going to mean so much to my community,"" she says. Esparza has only lost once in the States since she began entering national competitions nine years ago, and it was to another Latina: Christina Cruz, a Puerto Rican boxer who dominates the New York women's boxing scene. U.S. Olympic Coach Gloria Peek, who has trained the United States men's team for 33 years, notes that women's amateur boxing has been dominated by blacks and Latinas from working-class backgrounds, and that many have been transformed by the discipline of the sport. Esparza fits that profile: Once a troublemaker, she graduated in the top 2% of her high school class. Eight women will compete in each of three weight classes at the Olympic trials. They are the winners of the top national tournaments. So far, half the flyweights are Latinas. The other weight classes are dominated by African-American boxers. All the competitors will be chosen by October 8, after the year's last major national fight, the Police Athletic League championships. The trials are scheduled for February 2012. Only one woman in each weight class at the trials will make Team USA and win the chance to compete internationally. Meanwhile, Esparza has tied the record for most national championships by winning her sixth. Esparza says she's winning now by using guile and smarts, as well as her fists. ""I move my head a lot and I time people,"" she says. If her timing is right, Esparza will not only continue to get victories in the American ring, but she may just make a mark for Latinas around the world.","Women's boxing has been added to 2012 Olympic Games in London .

"(CNN) -- If humanitarian crises were listed by some sort of moral -- or editorial -- standards on the stock exchange, to help indicate which ones urgently require international news coverage and political action, shares of the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) would have commanded international news headlines and extensive press coverage over the past 12 years. The U.N. has labeled the DRC, Africa's second largest country, as the ""rape capital of the world"" because of the pace and scope of the use of rape as a weapon of war by proxy militia gangs fighting for control of Congo's easily appropriable and highly valuable natural resources, destined for sale in Europe, Asia, Canada and the United States. The wars in that country have claimed nearly the same number of lives as having a 9/11 every single day for 360 days, the genocide that struck Rwanda in 1994, the ethnic cleansing that overwhelmed Bosnia in the mid-1990s, the genocide that took place in Darfur, the number of people killed in the great tsunami that struck Asia in 2004, and the number of people who died in Hiroshima and Nagasaki -- all combined and then doubled. Yet we rarely hear anything about it. Indeed, one only need contrast media coverage of the latest Israeli airstrikes on the Gaza strip and Hamas rocket attacks into southern Israel, which have made front pages around the world, to the stunningly limited media coverage afforded to graphic accounts of atrocities committed that same week by M23, the newest militia gang terrorizing the local population. Desperate families flee Congo . The same trend has been observed in the extensive coverage of the on-going, fast-moving and difficult-to-report civil war in Syria, which has claimed nearly 40,000 lives. M23's murderous campaigns to besiege Congo's eastern mineral-rich provinces of North and South Kivu have left over 200,000 people in terrible conditions, killed countless and ushered in a dire humanitarian transgression. The Rwandan government has been accused by the United Nations of backing M23 by providing it with arms, support and soldiers, but Rwanda's President, Paul Kagame, has denied the allegation. The question here is not whether the human suffering in Congo deserves more media coverage because it is greater than that in Syria or Gaza, but rather, why has the crisis in Syria or Gaza qualified for extensive media coverage, but not the killing and raping industries in Congo? I doubt that this is because of a shortage of sobering imagery of Congo's killing fields or a lack of first-hand testimonies from survivors, or a lack of human rights and humanitarian reports and assessments of the situation. Is it due to the geographical or cultural distance between London or Washington and Congo? Or are Western media just reluctant, if not uninterested, to cover it because no Western interests or ally is endangered by it? Would the coverage the situation in Congo receives be the same if it was happening in Europe or if Congo spoke English rather than French? What if Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe or his disciples were implicated in funding murderous militia gangs in Congo? Or if the killing was between black Africans and Arabs? Or if minerals funding Congo's killing and raping industries benefited the East more than the West? But as an activist, I believe that the editors of news organizations such as CNN, Al Jazeera and the BBC must flood the airwaves with vivid images and news stories on the human sufferings in Congo. Newspapers such the Guardian, in the UK, and the New York Times must drumbeat front-page news stories on the wars and human tragedy engulfing that country. Unless they tip that balance a little and force policy makers in Washington and internationally to pay more attention and act, the killing, raping and looting that have thus far claimed over 5.4 million Congolese lives, and continue to leave 1,100 women raped every single day, could continue to unfold undetected by the camera lenses of Western media and excluded from Western political agenda. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Vava Tampa.","Vava Tampa: Why does crisis in Syria get extensive media coverage, but not the killing in Congo?

"(Mashable) -- Charlie Sheen may or may not be ""winning,"" in life, but he has won a rare honor: the ""Fastest Time to Reach 1 Million Followers"" Guinness World Record. Guinness community manager Dan Barrett says the agency ""just researched and approved"" the record this morning. According to Barrett, Sheen reached that milestone in 25 hours and 17 minutes. As of this writing, Sheen's Twitter account, @CharlieSheen, has more than 1.3 million followers. Guinness did not have a previous record for that category, Barrett says. Sheen also set a Guinness record for ""Highest Paid TV Actor Per Episode -- Current"" at $1.25 million. Sheen joined Twitter March 1. In a matter of minutes, Sheen acquired more than 60,000 followers and a Klout score of 57 -- without even tweeting. According to a report in Advertising Age, Sheen was able to get his account verified so quickly because Internet startup Ad.ly brokered his account with Twitter. Sheen, of course, has been all over the news since he publicly disparaged Chuck Lorre, producer of Sheen's successful sitcom ""Two and a Half Men"" in a bizarre interview with Alex Jones of InfoWars last month. Since then, Sheen has been interviewed by various other high-profile outlets making equally odd statements. The public meltdown has made Sheen a continual trending topic on Twitter and the subject of several YouTube parodies. For Guinness, this is the second high-profile application of the brand's records system to social media. Last month, the Nabisco cookie brand Oreo and rapper Lil Wayne squared off for the record for the most Facebook likes. Lil Wayne won that contest handily. © 2013 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- An Australian high court ruled Friday that a quadriplegic man has the right to refuse food and water and can be allowed to die, a rare legal finding that some see as a major victory for right-to-die campaigners. An Australian high court ruled Friday that Christian Rossiter has the right to refuse food and water. The ruling means that the nursing facility in which Christian Rossiter has lived since November 2008 cannot be held criminally liable for allowing the patient to die, the Supreme Court of Western Australia said. ""I'm happy that I won my right to die,"" Rossiter, 49, said afterward. But he added that he will further consult with a doctor because he may change his mind. A leading Australian right-to-die advocate called the ruling a significant victory. ""I don't know that many people will want to die this way. But for people who do, it's a very important decision,"" said Dr. Philip Nitschke, founder and director of Exit International, a leading global voluntary euthanasia and end-of-life advocacy group. Nitschke noted that Rossiter's case is significant because his mind is fully functional. ""This is the first time that it's come up with a person that's rational and lucid,"" Nitschke told CNN. ""This is unusual. It's very rare."" Chief Justice Wayne Martin noted that distinction in his order, saying, ""Mr. Rossiter is not a child, nor is he terminally ill, nor dying. He is not in a vegetative state, nor does he lack the capacity to communicate his wishes. There is therefore no question of other persons making decisions on his behalf. ""Rather, this is a case in which a person with full mental capacity and the ability to communicate his wishes has indicated that he wishes to direct those who have assumed responsibility for his care to discontinue the provision of treatment which maintains his existence."" Some family and right-to-life groups opposed Rossiter's request. ""Really, what we should be doing is looking after each other rather than facilitating an escape,"" John Barich of the Australian Family Association said in a TV interview. Peter O'Meara, president of Western Australia's Right to Life Association, said, ""The law which is being applied can be a dangerous precedent."" Rossiter has suffered a series of injuries since 1988 that have left him with limited foot movement and the ability to wriggle only one finger. He is fed through a stomach tube. He relies on staff at the Brightwater Care Group nursing facility in the city of Perth for such routine care as regular turning, cleaning, assistance with bowel movements, physical and occupational therapy and speech pathology. Australian law gives patients the right to refuse life-saving treatment, but helping someone commit suicide is a crime that can carry a life prison sentence. The Brightwater nursing facility sought the ruling to make sure it would not be held liable if it complied with Rossiter's request to stop all nutrition and hydration, except to be given enough liquid to make it possible to take pain medication. Rossiter attended the hearing in a wheelchair, breathing through a tracheotomy tube in his throat. He told the judge he wants to die. It's a point he has been making publicly. ""I can't move,"" Rossiter said in a televised interview this week. ""I can't even wipe the tears from my eyes. And I'd like to die. I'm imprisoned in my own body. I have no fear of death. Just pain."" Rossiter pointed out in a recent interview with the PerthNow news outlet that he once led an active life. ""This is living hell,"" he is quoted as saying. ""I used to be a cyclist, I used to be a keen walker. I bushwalked around the world. ... I've rock climbed in Yosemite Valley in California up very steep cliffs. I've got a degree in economics and now I can't even read a newspaper, I can't turn the pages."" Rossiter joined the Exit International right-to-death organization about three months ago, said Nitschke, who talked with him before the hearing. Nitschke said Rossiter appeared ""very happy"" afterward. A Brightwater executive said the company appreciates that the court's ruling has relieved the nursing facility of any liability. ""The whole organization has been most concerned for Mr. Rossiter but also concerned for our own legal standing and this has clarified things greatly,"" said Penny Flett, the company's chief executive. While hailing the victory, Nitschke decried the fact that Rossiter will have to undergo a slow and painful death through starvation, rather than having a quicker and painless way to end his life. Because he cannot use his hands, Rossiter must rely on others to withhold treatment rather than being able to take his own life. Switzerland has an assisted suicide law, and Rossiter has considered going there. ""It's a bit sad that the best that Australia can come up with,"" Nitschke said, ""is that we can let a person like that starve to death.""","Series of accidents in 1988 left Christian Rossiter unable to live normally .

"(CNN) -- Facebook's flirtation with democracy has come to an end. If it wants to, the social network can now change its policies without user approval. A weeklong open vote on proposed policy changes, including whether to keep public voting and how data is shared with affiliates such as Instagram, closed Monday. If Facebook goes ahead with its plans, this will be the last such public vote. For the results to be binding, more than 30% of Facebook users had to participate in the vote, which was hosted on the site by a third-party app developer. Facebook says it has more than a billion active users, so that meant at least 300 million members would have needed to vote. But only .2% of that amount went to the virtual polls. In his blog post announcing the vote last week, Facebook vice president of communications Elliot Schrage said, ""If turnout is less than 30%, the vote will be advisory."" Even with a sliver of the required votes, it's clear what Facebook users who voted are advising Facebook to do. Of the 668,752 members who did participate, 88% voted to stick with the existing policies. The two documents Facebook wishes to update are its data use policy and its statement of rights and responsibilities. The changes under consideration include updating the language of privacy controls to better explain what it means to hide content from your timeline. Another update would change how Facebook shares user data with companies it owns or partners with, most notably Instagram. The social network also wants to drop the voting system, which it established in 2009 as a response to privacy concerns. ""We will be announcing the results and the next steps regarding the governance process shortly, so check back soon,"" read a post Monday on the official Facebook Site Governance page. Now a third-party auditor will verify the tallies. But unless 299 million virtual votes were somehow misplaced, the results are clear.","An open vote on Facebook policy changes closes after a week .

"Bor, South Sudan (CNN) -- In the South Sudan city of Bor, memories of 1991 are playing out in real time. That was when Riek Machar fell out with John Garang, then the leader of the rebels fighting against the north in Sudan's bloody civil war. That split led to vicious attacks in Bor. People fled. People died. More than two decades later, after South Sudan achieved independence from Khartoum, after it became the world's newest nation, people are again dying. They are again fleeing government troops battle rebel followers of former Vice President Machar. In Bor, the evidence of fresh blood was everywhere Wednesday. On Christmas Day, the stores were looted, emptied of everything. The hospitals had no medicine, no doctors. Even the doctors ran to save their own lives. Homes lay burned. Razed. On both sides of the main roads, streams of people carried their life's belongings. Even chairs. Sporadic gunfire, mainly warning shots now from government troops, pierced the air. The heavy fighting, for now, was done. President Salva Kiir's soldiers were in control. The rebels were battling elsewhere for control including further north in the city of Malakal, the capital of oil-rich Upper Nile state. The fighting between rival ethnic groups, which began mid-month, has led to mass killings as evidenced by mass graves, the United Nations has said. The Security Council voted to add thousands more troops to its peacekeeping presence there to protect civilians in the young nation convulsed by violence. It would bring the total force up to 12,500 soldiers and 1,323 police officers. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon warned Wednesday those responsible for civilian deaths would be held accountable. ""We know many of you are suffering from horrific attacks,"" Ban told the people of South Sudan in a radio address. ""Families are fleeing their homes. Many of you have lost loved ones and are grieving. ""I once again call on the country's leaders to settle their differences peacefully -- and I underscore their responsibility to protect civilians,"" he said. ""I have warned all responsible for crimes that they will be held accountable."" And the Peace and Security Council of the African Union expressed ""deep dismay and disappointment that the continent's newest nation should descend so rapidly into internal strife."" It said it was alarmed by the ""escalation of ethnic mobilization by belligerents, and emphasized that such mobilization of ethnic forces has the potential of causing untold human suffering."" Fighting began months after Kiir dismissed Machar, whose supporters have taken up arms against the government. Kiir and Machar are longtime rivals from two different tribal clans, the Dinka and the Neur. As the crisis worsens, aid agencies predict they will need $166 million from now until March to provide water, sanitation, medical care and food. Even in Juba, the capital, food is running short. ""This is an extremely difficult time for the people of this new nation, and it is crucial that aid agencies have the resources they need to save lives in the coming months,"" said Toby Lanzer, UN Humanitarian Coordinator in South Sudan. In the last 10 days, 90,000 people have been forced from their homes; 58,000 of them are at UN peacekeeping bases. ""In Bor and Bentiu this week, I have seen just how badly the communities caught in violence need our help,"" Lanzer said. ""Our priorities are to stay, protect, and deliver. Bor is where Machar's forces fired on three U.S. military aircraft that were on an evacuation mission Saturday. Four Navy SEALs were injured; the most seriously injured of them was en route Wednesday to the U.S. military hospital facility in Landstuhl, Germany. He had been treated initially in Nairobi, Kenya. ""The fourth injured service member is on his way,"" a U.S. military official with knowledge of the operation said. ""I hear he is doing well."" The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the four SEALs were part of an operation to evacuate Americans in and around Bor when the CV-22 Osprey they were aboard was shot down. The Osprey was flown by an Air Force Special Operations team, and the SEALs were aboard to provide security when they landed, the official said. All four were shot in the upper leg and thigh, the official said. The San Diego-based SEALs were on a routine deployment in Djibouti, a U.S. military hub, when they were called upon to participate in the rescue, the official said. A bipartisan group of U.S. legislators sent a letter Tuesday to South Sudan's president, calling for a halt to rhetoric that condones violence against his rivals. South Sudan's breathtaking descent into widespread conflict comes a little more than two years after the nation was ushered into existence with help from international powers after decades of civil war between separatists in the oil-rich south and Sudan's government in Khartoum. In places like Bor, conflict had become a part of life, except perhaps for a brief time after South Sudan was born. In Bor Wednesday, a 33-year-old woman who had lived through the violence of 1991, found herself questioning the future. Again. ""How long,"" she asked, ""are we going to continue to run?"" Journalist Mading Ngor reported from Bor and CNN's Moni Basu wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Chelsea J. Carter, Azadeh Ansari, Barbara Starr, Nana Karikari-apau and Ben Brumfield contributed to this report.","NEW: Four Navy SEALs were shot in the legs and thigh, an official says .

"(CNN) -- A top Asian football official has urged the game's top law-making body to overturn a controversial ban on headscarves. Zhang Jilong, acting president of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) requested the International Football Association Board (IFAB) review its ruling at their upcoming meeting in London on March 3. ""I would like to request the IFAB to favorably consider FIFA's proposal and review the rule and allow women players to play wearing a safe headscarf that covers the neck,"" Jilong said in a statement on the AFC website. Jilong, who is also a member of FIFA's executive committee member said the review, which will be presented to the IFAB members by FIFA vice-president HRH Prince Ali bin Al Hussein, has the full backing of the AFC. Many women footballers in Asia wear headscarves, Jilong says while pointing out that many new designs of headscarf make safety far less of an issue. Soccer officials defend hijab ban . ""I have personally seen the new designs with a Velcro joined at the neck, which releases if the headscarf is pulled, ensuring the player's safety,"" Jilong said. IFAB is ""the guardian of the Laws of the Game and is responsible for studying, modifying and overseeing any changes to it"" according to FIFA, football's world governing body. FIFA banned the wearing of a headscarf or hijab on the field of play in 2007 and extended the safety rule to include neck warmers or snoods in July 2011. Jilong says a review of the ruling would be in the interests of women's football worldwide.","Acting head of Asian football demands FIFA law-making body review headscarf ban .

"(CNN) -- Thousands of people in parts of the northern United States and southeastern Canada endured at least their fourth consecutive day without electricity Thursday because of ice-related outages, and power companies warned some still might not have power until at least the weekend. More than 232,000 customers were without power in below-freezing temperatures Thursday in parts of Michigan, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, and northern New England. Storms that began hitting Michigan on Saturday and moved through New England early this week knocked down trees and power lines, leaving hundreds of thousands in the dark. At least 19 people died in weather-related incidents since Saturday, authorities said Thursday. Of the casualties, 14 were in the United States, according to various emergency management officials. The majority died of carbon monoxide poisoning, the officials said. In Kentucky, five people died in flooding-related incidents, state officials said. In Canada, three people in Quebec and two in Toronto died from carbon monoxide poisoning, official said. In areas near Toronto, where officials said the storm was one of the worst to hit the city, more than 54,000 were without power Thursday. While that's down from 300,000 at the peak, utility officials there declined to estimate when the last outages would be fixed. ""It's taking long because we haven't seen a storm like this in our history,"" Toronto Hydro spokeswoman Tanya Bruckmueller told CNN affiliate CBC News. ""The amount of damage to both our equipment due to the trees coming down is slowing us down, as well as this morning we've got snow coming, which is much heavier on the branches and is now covering a lot of what we need to be repairing."" Toronto resident Vic Baniuk told CBC on Thursday that his family hasn't had power for five days, and they were using a fireplace and a cast-iron stove to stay warm. ""We're sitting in the dark and cold, and I feel that everybody has ignored us,"" he told CBC. A tree branch pierced his roof, making a bad situation worse. ""This is not an inconvenience. This is an emergency, a disaster,"" CBC reported Baniuk said. Light snow might fall Thursday night and Friday morning in Toronto, where the temperature was -2 C (28 F) around 3 p.m. The temperature isn't expected to get above freezing until Saturday, with a high of 3 C (37 F) possible. Another 16,000 people were without power Thursday elsewhere in southern Ontario; 20,500 had no electricity in the Canadian province of New Brunswick, and another 8,900 still had outages in Quebec province, utility companies said. The Hyrdo-Quebec utility estimated that about 2,000 of its customers in Quebec, mostly in rural areas, would not get power back until Friday. Power to the people . Power crews were working around the clock and called in reinforcements from other states to help them wrangle electric lines back into place. They have made progress. Of the 470,000 customers left in the dark and cold earlier in the week in Michigan, all but 100,000 had electricity restored by Thursday morning, according to two utilities. High temperatures sat in the mid-20s around much of lower Michigan on Thursday. Ice could finally start melting Saturday, when temperatures could reach the high 30s or lower 40s. Michigan utility Consumers Energy warned the melting might not be all good news -- it might snap more tree branches and send them crashing into power lines, causing more outages. Consumers Energy said it expected to have most of the outages fixed by the end of Saturday. Utility crews have had to work against icebox weather conditions this week. One utility truck flipped over on a Michigan interstate Wednesday, as a dozen cars and trucks wiped out on the same patch of ice, CNN affiliate WOOD reported. About 600 customers had no power in parts of Vermont on Thursday morning. Roughly 30,000 people still were without electricity in Maine. With no power in her Litchifield, Maine, home on Wednesday afternoon, Mary Beth King cooked her family's Christmas dinner -- seafood chowder -- on an outdoor grill, CNN affiliate WGME reported. King's husband spent part of Christmas looking for a replacement for a generator that failed on Tuesday night. ""We do have a wood stove in the basement, which is wonderful, so it keeps the house warm. So we're lucky for that,"" she told WGME. 'Room at the inn' The storm clouds had a silver lining for some who lost power. They found generosity and new friends after turning to shelters to stay warm. More than 200 people took refuge Thursday in Red Cross shelters in Michigan and Maine, according to the relief group's online shelter tracker. ""Friends and family."" That's how Bonnie Libby described her shelter mates to WOOD after living with them for three days. The outage was a cure for loneliness on Christmas Day for Larry Sutherland. ""I would be spending it alone, and my Christmas dinner would be a microwave meal,"" he said. On Christmas Eve, power crews put the lights back on at the house of Dennis and Daisy Davis, but Christmas at home no longer felt right, and they returned to the Red Cross Shelter. ""I think it is just all the people pulling together,"" Daisy Davis told WOOD. ""I think it is the true meaning of Christmas."" Bonita Thomas wanted to host her grandchildren in her Flint-area apartment for Christmas, but falling trees cut the power to her building on Monday, and she began to shiver. She wrapped herself in layers. But when temperatures fell to the single digits, it was too much -- she called her grandkids' father, told them to stay home, and she went to a Red Cross shelter. Thomas was sad that she couldn't host her grandchildren, but she's grateful for the room and board, she told CNN. ""It's kind of depressing, but I just believe ... that God's still on my side. And there's room at the inn.""

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A Pakistani man is suing the U.S. government for $500 million over the death of his son and brother, whom he said were killed in a U.S. unmanned drone strike last year, his attorney said. Shahzad Akbar, attorney for Kareem Khan, said his client also wants all drone attacks halted. He said he has submitted a legal notice to U.S. officials, including Defense Secretary Robert Gates, CIA Director Leon Panetta and Islamabad's CIA station chief. Kareem Khan said an airstrike on December 31, 2009, targeted his home in Machikhel, a village in North Waziristan. Khan, a 43-year-old journalist, said he wasn't there at the time but that his family described a huge blast when the missiles hit. He said the reports that the strike killed militants were false. Instead, he says, the missiles killed his 35-year-old brother, Asif Iqbal, a teacher with a master's degree in English literature, his 18 year-old son Zaneullah Khan, a staff member at a government school, and a construction worker who was working on a village mosque. Akbar said drone strikes are killing innocent civilians and also violating international law by ignoring the ban on targeted killings and assassinations away from a battlefield. Kareem argues that the CIA station chief is ""a murderer who is to be taken to task."" Akbar said he is appealing to ""all those innocent victims/heirs of drone attacks to come and joins hands to get justice for their loved ones."" Two intelligence officials told CNN this week that that Kareem Khan was housing Haji Omar Khan, a notorious Taliban commander who also was killed in the strike. Kareem Khan denied that he knew Haji Omar Khan. Khan said news reports on the attacks were ""mostly misreported."" ""When my house was attacked, it flashed on the news that militants have been killed,"" Khan said. ""There were no militants in my house, neither on the day of drone strike nor before. My house wasn't a training center, either. Only innocent people where killed.""","Man is suing U.S. for $500 million in drone strikes he says killed three .

"(CNN) -- The Middle East is currently the setting of a new form of airspace race. As the economies grow in a handful of countries in the region, so too do ambitions -- and few things symbolize a country's aspirations as aptly as an airport. It's no wonder, then, that Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Doha, Istanbul and Riyadh are each vying to throw up the biggest and grandest transportation hub in the region. ""The Middle East likes to use words like 'iconic' and 'world class,'"" says Anthony Mosellie, a managing principal at Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates, the architecture firm in charge of the Abu Dhabi Midfield Terminal Complex design. The total airport expansion for Abu Dhabi, which is slated for completion in 2017, will clock in at $6.8 billion (Delta's $1.4 billion JFK upgrade pales in comparison). Though this sounds like a hefty sum, Mosellie notes that per-square foot, it's pretty reasonable. It just happens that the new complex will take up seven million square feet -- just a little larger than the Pentagon. It will also alter the Abu Dhabi skyline. ""It might be the tallest terminal building in the world,"" he notes. The new airports are already battling for superlatives. Doha's impending Hamad International Airport will house the world's second longest runway, while Istanbul and Dubai are competing for the title of world's largest airport. Fittingly, all are implementing state-of-the-art facilities -- be it specially designed runways or tiered bridges -- to accommodate the Airbus A380 -- the world's largest passenger aircraft. Read more: Google goes inside the Airbus A380 . To a degree, these looming hubs are also meant to be a showcase for the city beyond the passport controls. Retail, five-star hotels and landscaping are as much a part of the designs as customs and security features. The Abu Dhabi terminal, for instance, will also house a museum to pique interest in the city's impending Louvre and Guggenheim additions. ""A number of passengers may not make it to Abu Dhabi, because they're only connecting. The plan is to use the airport to introduce them so they can come back on subsequent visits,"" says Mosellie. Perhaps more telling than the various design features are the airports' planned capacities; combined, they will ultimately accommodate 450 million passengers a year -- a significant jump from the 140 million that currently make their way through the region. ""When you add the numbers together, it feels over the top. It seems it will be quite difficult for them to reach their aspirations when you view them in a cluster,"" says Rend Stephan, partner and managing director of The Boston Consulting Group. Still, Rend expresses doubts that any of the proposed airports will flounder. ""Maybe they won't fill capacity in the next five years, but I don't think any of the airports will collapse. The whole region has adopted an 'if-you-build-it-they-will-come' strategy. When you're advanced structurally, that strategy can work."" The airports are part of a wider expansion scheme across the region. Increased airport activity also means increased landing fees and duty-free revenues. In Dubai, aviation already accounts for 28% of the city's GDP -- a figure that's expected to grow to 35% once the new airport is fully operational. ""This is a country that sees the value of aviation and embraces it,"" says Lorne Riley, head of corporate communications at Dubai Airports. Read more: Inside Dubai's A380 concourse . Since its inception, Dubai International has seen its passenger numbers grow an average of 15% per year (roughly three times the global average). This year, it surpassed Charles de Gaulle in terms of international passenger traffic, making it the second busiest airport in the world. As a result, Riley is not worried they're overreaching with their plans. ""We're not overextended... yet. While it's not an issue now, it could become an issue in the 2020s when we max out our capacity, which is 74 million. By the end of the year, we should reach 66 million,"" says Riley. While Stephan thinks some of the airports might have to ""adjust their aspirations,"" he thinks each holds its own advantage. In particular, he predicts tremendous growth for the projected Istanbul New Airport, which is aiming for a yearly capacity of 150 million. ""Istanbul is growing. They are capturing a market share from European carriers, and compared to the GCC countries, they have a strong domestic market. Will they hit the exact numbers they talk about? Who knows? But they are quite strong, and I have no doubt this will continue into the foreseeable future,"" he says. Of greater concern, perhaps, is the limited amount of airspace available when all airports are up and running. Riley admits that there won't be room for two Dubai airports. ""You probably couldn't operate two airports of that size at full capacity so close to each other because of air traffic. Airspace is a finite thing,"" he says. What will ultimately happen to Dubai International, though, remains to be seen. ""We don't have a firm answer on that right now,"" Riley admits. ""Right now, the master plan is being looked at and fine tuned.""","Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Doha, Istanbul and Riyadh are all upgrading their main transport hubs.
There is pressure in the region to build the most 'iconic' airport.
The combined capacity in the region will number 450 million -- three times current traffic.
Istanbul and Dubai are both claiming their airports will be the world's biggest."
"(CNN) -- Denmark's Nicklas Bendtner has been fined US $125,800 for exposing boxer shorts adorned with the logo of an online betting company as he celebrated scoring against Portugal at Euro 2012. The Arsenal striker, who spent last season on loan to Sunderland, was also handed a one-game ban, European football's governing body, UEFA confirmed. After netting his second goal in the match last Wednesday, Bendtner lifted up his shirt to reveal the top of his underpants complete with the ""Paddy Power"" motif. ""Following the opening of disciplinary proceedings concerning the improper conduct of Denmark's Nicklas Bendtner against Portugal, the UEFA control and disciplinary body has decided to suspend the player for one competitive fixture, UEFA said in a statement.

""It is just a pair of lucky boxer shorts that I used in the first game as well and have used before the tournament,"" Bendtner told reporters. ""I didn't know I was breaking any rules but I am aware of that now."" But the severity of the punishment has sparked outrage on social media, with many questioning the size of the fine compared to those recently issued for racist incidents earlier in the year.

""If racism made money for Uefa like advertising does do you think Uefa would take it as serious?? ‪#priorities."" In April, Portuguese club FC Porto was fined only €20,000 (US $25,208) after their fans racially abused Manchester City striker Mario Balotelli. Paddy Power also voiced its opinion on Twitter: ""We think this is a hysterical and deeply cynical move by Uefa driven by pure commercialism!""

"(CNN) -- It is an imposing property. The World One towers over the coastline on a 17 acre site in the heart of the prime district of Upper Worli, Mumbai. As the sun started to set on our video shoot, the view of the Arabian Sea became hazy after our climb to the highest floor under intense construction. The haze is a good analogy for the economic and political climate in India overall, which is holding back demand in the property sector. This was evident in our visit in and around the financial capital of Mumbai. There is a problem at the core of India right now and that is growth, being held back by infrastructure which is clearly not keeping pace with the needs of the private sector. ""I think Mumbai is suffering today from the way the infrastructure is,"" Abhisheck Lodha, managing director of the company behind the World One project ,told me from the base of the residential towers. He said the government has made an effort over the past five years to improve the climate, but the last 50 years have be witness to woeful underinvestment.

"(CNN) -- The taste of success is sweet for Maria Sharapova -- in more ways than one. The Russian tennis star is focused on completing a coveted career grand slam of titles at the French Open starting next week, but she already has plans for her next off-court project. The 25-year-old is the world's highest-paid female athlete due to her top-end endorsement deals, according to Forbes magazine, and she has another lucrative sideline in the works. Having already designed clothes for Nike and luxury label Cole Haan among her projects, Sharapova is planning to release a line of confectionery called ""Sugarpova."" ""I'm doing everything. The branding and all the shapes of the candy and the gummy-bears,"" she told CNN's Open Court. ""And it is going to launch before the U.S. Open (in September), fingers crossed, so that is my next project."" Sharapova is big business, and she takes it seriously. ""It's such a different type of work to being a tennis player, working with consumers and understanding what people buy, trend reports, what's in and what's out, whether it's something that is going to last for years,"" she said. ""I look at it as something that is fun for me, that is creative for me, the thought process of seeing something that is on paper or just an idea. You're traveling and you see somebody wear a cross-body bag and you're like, 'Wow I love the handle on that,' and something clicks and you put it on paper and a year later you see it in the stores for people to buy. ""I am just fascinated by that, I think it is an amazing process and I've been so fortunate to work with so many great people that teach me so much about different things. I am not a designer, I never went to school for it, but I love being creative and I love learning and understanding what works and what doesn't work."" That attention to detail has also helped put Sharapova in a position to join an exclusive club of nine tennis players who have won all four grand slam titles, known as a ""career slam,"" having resurrected her fortunes in recent years after a serious shoulder injury. Despite having once described herself as ""a cow on ice"" on clay, Sharapova has improved her game on the surface to the point where the world No. 2 is now a top contender to win the French Open and add to her Wimbledon, U.S. Open and Australian Open crowns. Last year she reached the semifinals at Roland Garros for the second time, and she already has two tournament wins on red dirt under her belt this season after retaining the Italian Open title last weekend. ""The French Open is always a big goal of mine because I have always said it is going to be the most challenging grand slam for me to win,"" she said. ""Whether it was when I called myself that cow on ice or whatever it was, but if I go there and play well and physically, I feel healthy and I feel great. There is no reason I can't win it. ""I've been in a couple of semifinals, I believe, last year as well. So, it's really about (whether) I put myself in that position and win it. I believe in that definitely."" Sharapova has suffered just one defeat on clay all season -- to Serena Williams in the final of the Madrid Open -- and is coming into form at the right time. But despite her fluency on court in the past few weeks she revealed just how taxing the transition from hard courts to the much slower clay surface is every year. ""The first few days on clay are brutal, especially with the practices; you're just getting your footwork down and the movement,"" she said. ""It's so frustrating. I never crack rackets but those first few days I crack rackets all the time. I'm like 'Get me extra rackets!' ""Over the years I think the key for me is being physically stronger, where I have been able to play a match whether it's three sets or two tough sets and recover for the next day. ""In Europe one of the challenges you have is in one week you could be playing five, six matches a week then you have the next tournament coming up then a week off, then you have a grand slam. ""The physical aspect of all that and mentally understanding that your body has to be ready for all those matches in a short period of time on clay has always been tough for me. ""I have always recovered so much better and I move a lot better on it, so yeah it's nicer, less rackets cracked!"" The women often suffer from comparisons to the men, with the exploits of Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer cementing this as a golden age of competition in the male arena. But Sharapova insists the women's game is on an upward curve, with players like Victoria Azarenka, Petra Kvitova and Serena Williams battling it out for major honors, and a new generation of talented youngsters snapping at their heels. ""The level of the game from the first round that you play at a women's event is so much higher than you would see five, 10 years ago,"" she explained. ""I kind of felt that I'd come to a tournament, take the first few matches and see it as a warmup, in a way. Everyone in the press was saying why is it always 6-1 6-0 6-2? But now you don't see that very often. ""You could be facing someone in the first round that is maybe not as consistent but they are experienced, they have beaten top players before and it's difficult. ""I think that is why you see so much more attendances from the beginning of the week higher than you saw years ago."" Despite perching on the shoulder of history, Sharapova insists such landmarks do not dominate her every thought, though a newfound dedication to her profession was brought into sharp focus due to a serious injury. ""I've played tennis since I was four years old and when you're in a match situation -- you could be losing or you're winning -- there are so many emotions that go into that,"" she said. ""Even when I was away from the game for nine months with shoulder surgery and trying to get back, I never, never ever felt that. ""There were so many things I did off the court, just great experiences, wonderful people, I got to work on amazing projects but nothing gave me that feeling of being in those positions where I had to pull out of a match when I was losing. ""(When I) had to close it out when I didn't expect myself to win, it was such an adrenaline rush that you don't get in many things in life. ""Whether it's playing some small tournament in a small city in front of 2,000 people or whether it's the finals of Wimbledon where you have an amazing crowd and all that history behind it, it is really at the end of the day trying to make yourself better.""","Maria Sharapova plans to branch out with another business venture this year .

"(CNN) -- Behind nearly every American tragedy is a conspiracy theory. Think JFK's assassination, even the 9/11 attacks. So it's no surprise that there have been similar doubts that a fuel tank explosion caused the 1996 crash of TWA Flight 800, killing all 230 people aboard. That was the government's ruling, yet it never quelled the theory that a missile strike brought down the plane off the coast of Long Island, New York. So why is an upcoming documentary set to air on an obscure cable channel that rehashes this theory getting so much attention this week? ""TWA Flight 800"" is based on the claims of former federal investigators who took part in the initial probe and witnesses who say their accounts were not taken seriously. They want a do-over. Hank Hughes, who was the National Transportation Safety Board's senior accident investigator for TWA 800, is among the ex-investigators featured in the documentary calling for a new probe into what caused the crash. He said the NTSB's final report on the crash ignored witnesses, misinterpreted bomb residue and misanalyzed radar data. Bottom line, according to the documentary producers: ""One or more ordnance explosions outside the aircraft caused the crash."" The documentary does not identify or speculate about who fired the ordnance; it says only that they most likely were launched from the waters off Long Island. They are hoping that the NTSB, the nation's top investigative agency for plane crashes, will determine that by reopening the investigation into TWA 800. All this is fueling suspicion that has been around for years about a possible cover-up. One story that surfaced shortly after the crash laid out an elaborate conspiracy theory that the crash was caused by a U.S. Navy ""friendly fire"" incident that was followed by a huge government cover-up. The report was co-authored by Ian Goddard, Mike Sommers and the late former ABC News reporter Pierre Salinger. Goddard later apologized for the report, saying ""my effort to pin the crash ... on the Navy was reckless and a mistake."" Related: Still 'paranoid' after all these years . Conspiracy talk gets people's attention. As CNN commenter RUDucky2 points out: ""Conspiracies are very comforting creatures."" They give society ""bad guys to hunt."" And any proof that contradicts the conspiracy ""becomes more 'proof' that there's a conspiracy."" And colleagues of the ex-investigators featured in the documentary fear this is nothing more than an effort to stir up conspiracy theories. ""I would never be part of any cover-up. Period,"" former NTSB official John Goglia told CNN. Goglia, who served on the five-member NTSB during the investigation, said he ""took offense"" at any suggestion that his team ignored evidence. None of the evidence detailing how the plane fell apart supports the missile theory, he said. It's not like the missile theory was dismissed at the outset, said the top FBI investigator on the case, James Kallstrom. ""We took the ... possibility a missile brought down the plane very, very seriously,"" Kallstrom told CNN. ""We we're 99% sure that this was not a terrorist."" But what about that remaining 1%? There are parts of the investigation that can point ""any way you want,"" Goglia said. But most importantly, he said, the pieces of the puzzle have to be judged ""as a whole."" How about the former investigators in the documentary who are calling for a new probe? Do they stand to gain anything from all this? ""There's no motive in this other than we want to get it straight,"" said Hughes, who wrote a petition asking the NTSB to reopen its investigation. ""It's a matter of personal integrity for us ... we have nothing to gain financially or otherwise..."" Read the petition . Kallstrom said he doesn't question Hughes' motives, but he added, ""I just wished if someone felt that strongly about speaking like that, they could have brought it to someone's attention ... commencing with the investigation -- not wait 17 years until they get their pensions in their pockets and then come out with it."" Longtime aviation journalist Sylvia Adcock thought one point was worth noting: The documentary boasts that ""investigators finally break their silence."" That's interesting because, Adcock says, one of the investigators actually testified during a Senate hearing in 1999. ""It would seem that if he had something more pertinent to say he would have said it long ago,"" Adcock wrote in her CNN opinion piece. Much of the documentary -- which was made available to the media before its July 17 premiere -- rests its theory on an analysis of the evidence by the film's co-producer, Tom Stalcup, who was not involved in the probe. A longtime and passionate critic of the official investigation, Stalcup has been vexed by witness accounts that are at odds with the fuel tank explosion theory. Of course if the disaster happened today, the world would weigh in almost immediately on what witnesses saw based on countless smartphone videos of the blast that would pop up online. So, will the NTSB have to go back to square one all these years later? Kallstrom -- a former FBI assistant director -- said he wouldn't be opposed to the FBI joining with the NTSB to take another look at the case. The agency told CNN it has received Hughes' petition and ""will respond to the petitioners once a determination is made."" The NTSB noted that petitions must be based on new evidence or ""on a showing that the Board's findings are erroneous."" New evidence? The basic claim that a missile hit the plane isn't new, wrote Adcock. The radar data doesn't appear to be new either, according to journalist James Polk, one of CNN's lead producers covering the disaster. ""As far as I can tell from reading the petition, there's no new evidence,"" Polk said. ""But their alternative interpretation of existing evidence and their assumptions alone probably will not be sufficient to persuade the NTSB to start all over again from scratch."" Whatever comes out of all this, it's unlikely to smother the debate and the conspiracy theories swirling around one of aviation history's most mysterious plane crashes.","Debate rages over documentary about 1996 crash of TWA Flight 800 .

"(WIRED) -- An anarchist social worker raided by the feds wants his computers, manuscripts and pick axes back. He argues that authorities violated the U.S. Constitution and the rights of his mentally ill clients while searching for evidence that he broke an anti-rioting law on Twitter. In a guns-drawn raid on October 1, FBI agents and police seized boxes of dubious ""evidence"" from the Queens, New York, home of Elliott Madison. A U.S. District Judge in Brooklyn has set a Monday deadline to rule on the legality of the search, and in the meantime has ordered the government to refrain from examining the material taken in the 6 a.m. search. Madison, who counsels more than 100 severely mentally ill patients in New York, seems to have first drawn attention from the authorities at September's G-20 gathering of world leaders in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. There he was arrested on September 24 at a motel room for allegedly listening to a police scanner and relaying information on Twitter to help protesters avoid heavily-armed cops -- an activity the State Department lauded when it happened in Iran. A week later, the Joint Terrorism Task Force, armed with a search warrant and backed by a federal grand jury investigation, raided Madison's house, which he shares with his wife of 13 years and several roommates. The squad seized his computers, camera memory cards, books, air-filtration masks, bumper stickers and political posters -- all purportedly evidence that the 41-year old social worker had broken a federal anti-rioting law that carries up to five years in prison. But a closer look at the court documents leaves the unmistakable impression that Elliott Madison is yet another casualty of the government's nasty, post-9/11 habit of considering political dissidents as threats to national security. Madison, his wife and his lawyer Martin Stolar say the search violates the Constitution's protections against general searches and prosecution for political speech. The police also seized mobile phones, citizen emergency kits, manuscripts, posters and even the couple's marriage license. In a motion to throw out the search, Stolar called the search unconstitutional: . In this day and age, federally authorized agents entered the private home of a writer and urban planner and seized their books and writings. The warrant's vagueness and lack of specificity encouraged the agents to use their own discretion and their own views of the political universe to seize, or not to seize, items which they thought were evidence of a violation of the federal anti-riot statute. The law and the Constitution do not allow this. If there really is a grand jury investigation with possible future prosecution under [a federal anti-rioting law], the use of this statute as applied to demonstrations, demonstrators, and their supporters has profound 1st Amendment implications. If Madison were an Iranian using Twitter to coordinate government protests, he'd likely be considered a hero in the West. Instead, the self-identified anarchist -- who volunteered in Louisiana after Katrina -- is now facing up to five years in prison for each count a grand jury cares to indict him on. Oddly, Madison was in jail during the most dramatic of the G-20 confrontations. The day after his arrest by Philadelphia State police on September 24, hundreds of police officers chased protesters around the city, using sonic weapons, pepper spray, batons, projectile weapons and tear gas, and arrested a reporter and bystanders. Some self-styled anarchists broke windows of chain stores and pushed a dumpster towards a phalanx of cops in riot gear. The connection between the federal and state investigation remains unclear, though the feds say they will turn evidence over to the state, if any is found. The affidavits justifying the raid remains under seal, but court documents reveal a grand jury is investigating whether Madison, and possibly his wife, violated 18 U.S.C. §2101, the federal anti-rioting law. That obscure law was famously used to prosecute the Chicago 7 after the 1968 Democratic Convention's police riot. Five of the so-called Yippies were initially found guilty of of inciting a riot, though the convictions were eventually thrown out. Madison and his wife both volunteered as paralegals for the People's Law Collective, their lawyer Martin Stolar said, and he'd worked with them before defending protesters. In fact, he suggests that work might have sparked this entire incident. ""If you do your job effectively, then you draw the government's attentions,"" Stolar said. Madison also belongs to the ""Curious George Brigade,"" which published a book called Anarchy in the Age of Dinosaurs. The group was at work on a follow-up, until 50 copies of the first book and the electronic manuscript of the second were confiscated in the raid. On Monday, Madison described the book in an affidavit to the court as a book of ""political theory and practice."" The published book seems sympathetic to the tactic of confronting police and destroying property of companies considered harmful, usually -- though not always -- multinational companies. Writing such a book is not a crime, though, and many of the other books cited by the police as evidence justifying the search after the fact can be bought on Amazon.com. Madison, who has no prior convictions, works as a counselor at a mental health facility. He says some of the records seized by the government include confidential information that should be covered by a shield law protecting mental health records. The U.S. Attorney's office disputes that contention, saying the shield doesn't apply since Madison isn't a registered social worker. Moreover, the government says, Madison's house was chock full of incriminating materials, including gas masks, pickaxes and air-filtration masks. But Madison says that he'd become a believer in civil defense after the 2003 blackouts in New York and that the seized pickaxes are specialty, anti-sparking devices to be used in emergencies to shut off water mains. In fact, Madison and his wife told the court they'd made a YouTube video about what to put in a rescue pack. A review of the video by Threat Level confirms the pickaxe in the video matches the one seized by police. The government countered that his reading material is also very suspicious. ""As an initial matter, the government notes that a publication entitled 'Manifesto of Rioting' was seized from the Weisses' bedroom,"" the U.S. Attorney's office told the court last week. Some of the other evidence the feds seized that shows he promotes riots? Steampunk magazine, for one. Buffy the Vampire Slayer DVDs. Anarchist political-theory books. A needlepoint depiction of Lenin that belonged to Madison's wife's grandmother. (Not surprisingly, the police don't seem to grasp the irony of an anarchist owning a Lenin bust in any form, given the hatred between the two ideologies since the Spanish Civil War, when the Communists turned on the anarchists and murdered their ostensible allies.) His books on poison looks pretty incriminating, too. But his lawyer wonders why the police seized The Poisons and Antidotes Sourcebook and left the book Deadly Doses: A Writer's Guide to Poisons, both of which he says Elliot Madison uses for his fiction writing. The feds also found caltrops -- four-pronged metal defensive weapons that always land with a pointy side up, used to give flat tires or hobble horses. Neither Madison nor his attorney has mentioned them in their filings. They are not illegal to own. When the feds also found nine packages of fireworks at the rear of a closet, a JTTF agent took him downtown to book him for the infraction -- a ticketable offense. The bomb squad took care of the fireworks, which one supposes must have been impervious to dousing by a regular police officer. Federal agents also seized camera memory disks, Madison's journals, computers and hard drives. These contained his fiction manuscripts, his wife's urban planning work and other writings. The police also confiscated a housemate's laptop that belonged to the Labor Department. How did all of this get taken? Doesn't a search warrant have to specify what exactly is to be seized? According to the U.S. Attorney's office, the warrant was legitimate. Signed by Judge Honorable Viktor V. Pohorelsky on September 26, it authorized the government to seize: . Computers, hard-drives, floppy discs and other media used to store computer-accessible information, cellular phones, personal digital assistants, electronic storage devices and related peripherals, black masks and clothing, maps, correspondence and other documents, financial records, notes, ledgers, receipts, papers, photographs, telephone and address books, identification documents, indicia of residency and other documents and records that constitute evidence of the commission of rioting crimes or that are designed or intended as a means of violating the federal rioting laws, including any of the above items that are maintained within other closed or locked containers, including safes and other containers that may be further secured by key locks (or combination locks) of various kinds. The list of what was taken stretches pages. The Madisons' lawyers are trying to overturn the search on the grounds that the warrant wasn't specific enough to pass constitutional muster. They also argue the feds have no business collecting the names of people Elliot communicated with, and that records from the People's Law Collective, as well as his work notes, are protected under confidentiality rules. But the U.S. Attorney's Office defended the search in court, arguing that the broad search was just like those used in drug warrants, which were increasingly broadened over the last quarter century's ill-fated War on Drugs. The affidavits that supported the search warrant are under court seal, because the grand jury investigation is ""complex and multi-state,"" according to the prosecution. The federal anti-rioting statute is serious business, and is seemingly easy to violate. For instance, it is a felony to ""organize, promote, encourage, participate in, or carry on a riot; or [...] to aid or abet any person in inciting or participating in [...] a riot."" By that token, simply telling a person fleeing cops with batons which way to run makes you a felon. One wonders how the Southern Christian Leadership Council and Martin Luther King, Jr. would have fared under that law, when he was in a Birmingham jail, writing letters urging people to support the direct-action program of sit-ins and marches. Those protesters were later attacked by police using dogs and fire hoses on the orders of Birmingham Sheriff Bull Connor. A spokesman for the New York U.S. Attorney's office, Bob Nardoza, declined to comment on the matter, citing rules forbidding officials to speak about grand jury investigations.

"(CNN) -- German Chancellor Angela Merkel fractured her pelvis in a skiing accident in Switzerland over the holidays, her spokesman told reporters Monday. Merkel was cross-country skiing when the accident occurred. Spokesman Steffen Seibert did not disclose the date of the incident, but said her injuries are not thought to be serious and it is thought she will make a full recovery. Merkel, who has been Chancellor of Germany since 2005, will need aid to walk over the next few weeks and will be canceling some of her commitments, Seibert said. Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) said it will delay its party retreat, originally slated for January 10-11, as a result of her accident. The news of Merkel's fall comes just eight days after her fellow countryman Michael Schumacher, the most successful driver in Formula One history, was critically injured while skiing in the French Alps . Schumacher, who fell and hit his head on rocks while skiing off-piste on December 29 in Meribel, has undergone two operations and is in a medically induced coma. The German racing legend remains in a critical but stable condition, according to his manager.","Angela Merkel fractures pelvis in skiing accident in Switzerland over winter holiday .

But it was her Emmy-winning role as Edna Krabappel, Bart Simpson's teacher with the snarky laugh, that may have earned her the most fame in recent years. It was a part she held since the show's premiere in 1990. ""I was tremendously saddened to learn this morning of the passing of the brilliant and gracious Marcia Wallace,"" executive producer Al Jean of ""The Simpsons"" said in a statement. ""She was beloved by all at 'The Simpsons' and we intend to retire her irreplaceable character."" Jean said rumors that the show had already planned to retire Wallace's character are not true, he added. ""Marcia's passing is unrelated and again, a terrible loss for all who had the pleasure of knowing her,"" Jean said. Wallace was a regular guest star on a host of popular TV shows in the 1970s and 1980s, from ""The Love Boat"" and ""Fantasy Island"" to ""Gimme a Break!"", ""ALF,"" ""Night Court,"" ""Charles in Charge"" and ""Magnum, P.I."" She was also a mainstay of TV game shows such ""The Hollywood Squares,"" ""Password"" and ""The (New) $25,000 Pyramid"" and starred in numerous stage productions, including a touring production of ""The Vagina Monologues."" In recent years, Wallace also advocated for awareness of breast cancer, a disease she battled herself. Her 2004 book, ""Don't Look Back, We're Not Going That Way,"" in part chronicled her fight.

"(CNN) -- In what should have been one of the more emotional and poignant moments of the president's State of the Union address, I'm left with just one feeling after watching the recognition of Sgt. 1st Class Cory Remsburg, who was wounded in an IED explosion in Afghanistan. Frustration. That might seem like a harsh critique, and it's not directed at either the president or Remsburg. It's pointed squarely at some of my fellow veterans and commentators and their reactions to this event, turning the appearance into political theater. A bipartisan outpouring for wounded war hero . As I watched the address Tuesday night, I could feel the emotions of Remsburg. I've felt the same thing. At the All-American Bowl in San Antonio in 2011, I stood in front of thousands of people in a packed football stadium full of cheering fans, on a field with other wounded warriors and heroes. We waited anxiously, appreciative of the people cheering us, but we were also confused. What we did, while viewed as heroic by others, was simply our job. It might be hard to imagine, but the recognition felt misplaced. I understood that thousands of other troops have sacrificed as well, along with our nation's firefighters, police and other first responders. I asked myself, ""Why me? What did I do that was different?"" I bet Remsburg, the Army Ranger, may have felt the same way in front of all those cameras Tuesday night. He said what? Obama's speech explained . That being said, the recognition by President Barack Obama at the end of the State of the Union address was appropriate. He shared a personal anecdote about their previous interactions together, a history of Remsburg's service. Then the President expressed gratitude, saluting in the direction of the soldier being honored. All that was fine. My frustration stems from the public response to that last part of the State of the Union address. Many friends, both veterans and non-veterans alike, are using Remsburg's appearance to further their political or ideological agenda. Opinion: Can Obama deliver action on inequality? Those who are on the right claim it was a fake, propaganda-laden showing that exploited the deeds of our troops. Those on the left regale the commander in chief with praise, having concrete proof that the president does, in fact, support the troops. The reality of the situation, however, is a bit more simple. The President made a respectful gesture of recognition toward an individual soldier and his accomplishments, and showcased this on a national stage. That's it. Regardless of where you stand on health care, gun laws, big government, the minimum wage or other divisive issues, we should all be able to, for just one night, applaud Remsburg and our troops in harm's way. We have plenty of time to return to the partisan bickering and politics of division later. For just one night, it's really OK to simply honor a soldier and his sacrifice. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Heath.","David Heath, a war veteran, says celebrating veterans shouldn't be about politics .

"(CNN) -- Mohamed Morsi is an American-educated engineer who vows to stand for democracy, women's rights, and peaceful relations with Israel if he wins the Egyptian presidency. He's also an Islamist figure who has argued for barring women from the Egyptian presidency and called Israeli leaders ""vampires"" and ""killers."" One analyst describes him as an ""icon"" of those seeking an ""extreme agenda."" As Morsi, 60, battles to win the presidency, questions surround how much of a hard line he would take, and what direction he would steer the country. Morsi leads the Freedom and Justice Party, the political wing of the Muslim Brotherhood -- the most powerful political movement in the new Egyptian government, controlling about half of parliament. His party notes that he was arrested several times under President Hosni Mubarak's regime for protesting ""repressive measures and oppressive practices,"" as well as ""rigged elections."" At one point he spent seven months in jail. Analysts say Morsi is focusing his campaign on appealing to the broadest possible audience. But he ""represents the older, more conservative wing of the Brotherhood and openly endorses a strict Islamic vision,"" Isobel Coleman of the Council on Foreign Relations wrote in a column for CNN.com. ""A vote for Mohamed Morsi will consolidate the Brotherhood's political influence, which could translate into a constitution with weaker provisions for protection of minority and women's rights."" A slogan associated with his campaign, ""Islam is the solution,"" is sparking concerns Morsi could introduce a fundamentalist Islamic theocracy. He told CNN he has no such plans. His party seeks ""an executive branch that represents the people's true will and implements their public interests,"" Morsi told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. ""There is no such thing called an Islamic democracy. There is democracy only. ... The people are the source of authority,"" he said. Asked about the role of women, he vowed that ""women's rights are equal to men."" And asked whether he would maintain Egypt's 1979 accord with Israel, Morsi answered, ""Yes, of course I will. I will respect it provided the other side keep it up and respect it."" Morsi was not originally his party's candidate for the country's top post. He was called on to step in after the first choice was disqualified. Khairat al-Shater was among three candidates who were told they did not meet candidacy requirements. The Egyptian media then portrayed Morsi as ""an accident of history,"" said Shadi Hamid of the Brookings Dohan Center and the Brookings Institution. In a column published by The Atlantic, Hamid said Morsi lacks the charisma and ""crossover appeal"" of al-Shater. The Financial Times notes that the Muslim Brotherhood had originally pledged not to seek the presidency. ""It went back on its word, suspecting that its gains since the January 2011 revolution could be undermined by the military council that has ruled since the fall of President Hosni Mubarak."" Morsi has served as a central behind-the-scenes player for much of the past decade, Eric Trager of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy writes in a column for The New Republic. He was the Brotherhood's primary point man for state security -- ""the repressive domestic security apparatus through which the Mubarak regime monitored and infiltrated opposition groups,"" Trager writes. ""Indeed, Brotherhood leaders trusted Morsi because they viewed him as ideologically rigid, and therefore unlikely to concede too much to the regime during negotiations."" Morsi was also ""an icon of the extremists in the Muslim Brotherhood,"" pushing for an ""extreme agenda,"" Trager writes. Morsi's official biography on the Freedom and Justice Party website describes him as ""one of the most prominent political leadership figures of the Brotherhood, the organization that led the struggle against the ousted repressive regime in its last decade."" He led the Brotherhood's parliamentary bloc from 2000 to 2005 in addition to serving as president of the Department of Materials Science, Faculty of Engineering at Zagazig University. Morsi was arrested several times ""due to his constantly firm stance against the repressive measures and oppressive practices of the overthrown regime,"" the party said. ""After the 2005 elections were rigged, Dr. Mohamed Morsi led demonstrations in support for judges demanding independence, refusing referral of some judges to the Competence Commission to punish them for their outspoken views against blatant elections fraud."" The following May, he was among 500 members of the Brotherhood arrested, the party said. Morsi spent seven months behind bars. ""He was arrested, yet again, on the morning of the 'Friday of Anger' on January 28, 2011, during the revolution of January 25 along with a large number of Brotherhood leaders across Egypt. ... When several prisons were destroyed during the revolution, and many prisoners escaped, Dr. Morsi refused to leave his prison cell. Instead, he contacted satellite TV channels and news agencies demanding the judicial authorities visit the prison and check the legal position of jailed Muslim Brotherhood leaders, to clarify if there were indeed any legal reasons for their arrest,"" the party website says. Morsi -- who has Bachelor and Master degrees from Cairo University and a doctorate from the University of Southern California -- insists that under his leadership, such abuses won't happen. There will be ""no need for worry at all over any kind of abusive power,"" he told CNN. ""It will be impossible to allow these kinds of abuse in the shadow of a constitutional state, a lawful state, a state that protects the dignity of a person.""","Mohamed Morsi promises a democracy with the people as the source of authority .

"(CNN) -- Police arrested another teen Thursday, the sixth suspect jailed in connection with the gang rape of a 15-year-old girl on a northern California high school campus. Jose Carlos Montano, 18, was arrested on charges of felony rape, rape in concert with force, and penetration with a foreign object, said Richmond Police Lt. Mark Gagan. Montano was arrested Thursday evening in San Pablo, California, a small town about two miles from the city of Richmond, where the crime took place. Montano, who was held in lieu of $1.3 million bail, is accused of taking part in what police said was a 2½-hour assault on the Richmond High School campus. Police said as many as 10 people were involved in the rape in a dimly lit back alley at the school, while another 10 people watched without calling 911. The victim was taken to the hospital in critical condition, but was released Wednesday. Four other teenage suspects were arraigned Thursday on charges connected to the rape. Cody Ray Smith, described by the court as older than 14, pleaded not guilty to charges of rape with a foreign object and rape by force. Two other juveniles, Ari Abdallah Morales and Marcelles James Peter, appeared with Smith at the Contra Costa County Superior Court, but did not enter a plea. The court described Morales as younger than 16, and did not give an age for Peter. All three juveniles, who wore bulletproof vests at the hearing, were charged as adults. A fourth person, Manuel Ortega, 19, appeared separately without an attorney and did not enter a plea. He did not wear a protective vest. Another person, Salvador Rodriguez, 21, was arrested Tuesday night, but he was not in court Thursday.","Another arrest made in gang rape outside California school .

"(CNN) -- It's a fun way to address a serious problem. Weightless teachers float around inside a modified 727 with padded walls and ceilings. Many in the U.S. tech industry worry that not enough students are pursuing careers in engineering, math, and science. So the Northrop Grumman Foundation is sending teachers on the ride of their lives -- a weightless experience aboard a plane chartered from the Zero Gravity Corporation. Northrop, an aerospace and defense company, says the idea is for teachers to take their exhilarating experience back to their classrooms -- and inspire in their students a love of science. Northrop Grumman spokesman Tom Henson said the Weightless Flights of Discovery program is aimed at middle school teachers. ""Information has shown us that if kids are going to lose an interest in math and science, it's going to be during these years,"" he said. ""So we've targeted these teachers to try to illustrate for their students how math and science can be cool and relevant and applied to their daily lives, and just fun."" The program is three years old. This year, Northrop conducted weightless flights in California, Florida, Illinois and Georgia.  Watch teachers experience zero gravity » . From a pool of applicants, Northrop selected 60 teachers from each location. Before each flight, the teachers took part in a workshop in which they designed experiments to be conducted on the flight. The experiments were to test Newton's Laws of Motion; for instance, seeing how objects fall in microgravity in order to explain the difference between mass and weight. The flights took place aboard a modified 727. There are seven rows of seats in the back of the jet; the rest of the cabin is open and windowless, except for the emergency exits. The floors, walls and ceilings are padded. CNN accompanied the teachers on one of the Georgia flights, which took off from Atlanta's airport. The plane performed its weightless maneuvers over a chunk of airspace 100 miles long by 10 miles wide over the Atlantic Ocean. Specially trained pilots took the plane into a series of parabolas, essentially a series of up-and-down curves. As the 727 crested and descended each parabola, it created a microgravity environment that lasted about 30 seconds. The plane flew 15 parabolas. The first simulated the gravity felt on Mars (1/3 the gravity of Earth) and the next two recreated gravity felt on the moon (1/6 Earth gravity). This helped the teachers acclimate to the weightlessness of zero gravity felt on the last 12 parabolas. Tracy Heffelfinger, who teaches at Little Mill Middle School in Forsyth County, Georgia, said the experience gave her a great appreciation for what astronauts have to do in space. ""As a science teacher, you're told what all affects how you move, and that gravity is a great portion of that,"" she said. ""It's another thing to get up there and experience it. I would try things like, I just wanted to hover off the ground a little bit, but the problem is if you push up enough to get off the ground, there's nothing to stop you and you keep going until you hit the ceiling."" Heffelfinger said the experience will make it a lot easier to bring science to life for her students. Northrop's Henson said the flights have already helped the 780 teachers who participated in the program in 2006 and 2007, according to a recent Northrop poll of those teachers. ""Roughly 92 percent said there's been a noticeable increase in their students' overall interest in science since this program,"" he said. ""Almost 75 percent saw an increased number of students expressing a desire to continue studying science, which is important, because we're trying to keep students from dropping out of science in the middle school years."" Henson also said nearly 78 percent of the educators reported a rise in the number of students planning to pursue a math- or science-related career. ""I think the program is reaching who it needs to reach,"" he said. Northrop estimated 31,000 students have gotten the ""science is cool"" message from this program. Aboard the Atlanta flight, teachers screamed in delight and amazement as they defied gravity. They launched themselves like Superman, drank floating globs of water and tossed each other around like balls, in addition to performing a variety of experiments. A few educators experienced motion sickness. Parabolic flight is the same technique used to train astronauts, and the NASA jet is nicknamed ""the vomit comet."" But astronauts are sent on 40 or more parabolas per flight, while the teachers experienced only 15, which minimized the discomfort. Heffelfinger said she had no problems, even though her students had teased her about the possibility. ""I'm very proud of the fact that I'll be able to show them my unused barf bag,"" she said with a laugh.","The Northrop Grumman Foundation is sending teachers on zero-gravity plane flights .

"(CNN) -- A Syrian city known for its relative calm during the Syrian uprising has been stormed by security forces, an opposition activist group said Tuesday. The Local Coordination Committees of Syria -- a network of opposition activists -- said security and government forces entered the Tal Refaat neighborhood of Aleppo. Aleppo, Syria's largest city, is the economic center of the country, and the city's merchant class had been largely unaffected by the country's upheaval. Meanwhile, the city of Al-Rastan was being bombarded by the army and ""heavy machine guns mounted on tanks,"" on Tuesday, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The observatory said 20 people were wounded, seven of them seriously, in the Homs province city. Since protests began in March, demonstrators have demanded true democratic elections and the ouster of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, but such protests have often been met with force. Almost 3,000 people have died in the government's crackdown, according to some accounts. CNN is unable to independently confirm death tolls or events in Syria, which has restricted access to many parts of the country by international journalists. The Syrian government has been battling opposition activists for what it calls a campaign against terrorists. At the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid Moallem blamed ""foreign incitement"" for the troubles, which he said were fueled by U.S. and European sanctions. ""This course cannot in any way be reconciled with pronouncements about concern for the interests, security and rights of the Syrian people,"" Moallem told the General Assembly. ""It further runs counter to the basic principles of human rights in defense of which these states base their interference in our internal affairs."" He said Syria had been ""a model of peaceful co-existence"" among its people's religious and ethnic groups, and that disturbing that peace was aimed at ""spreading Western hegemony over the countries of the Mediterranean and serving Israel's expansionist interests."" On Monday, the state-run news agency SANA published a report citing an unnamed military source saying that authorities found Israeli weapons, explosives and stolen military uniforms in Homs and recovered weapons, ammunition detonators and other military supplies hidden in a drum and a water tank in the garden of a house in Naseeb, a city in Daraa province.

"Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- A medical examiner and three employees were suspended Monday pending the outcome of an inquiry into whether they meddled with the body of a slain Mexican drug kingpin, a state prosecutor's office official told CNN. Arturo Beltran Leyva, a drug trafficker known as ""the boss of bosses,"" was killed on December 16 when Mexican navy commandos stormed a luxury condo in Cuernavaca, Mexico, where he was staying. Photos from the scene showed Beltran Leyva's body splayed on the ground, with his pants pulled down past his knees and his T-shirt lifted up to his shoulders. The body was covered in blood-stained $100 bills and Mexican banknotes. The images created controversy in Mexico because it appeared that he intentionally had been placed in that position, in effect altering the scene. The official, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to talk publicly about the case, said the four state employees will remain suspended until an investigation is complete. Two forensic photographers are also subjects in the inquiry but were not suspended, the source said. The end of Beltran Leyva's reign over the cartel of the same name was hailed by Mexico and the United States as a major victory for Mexican President Felipe Calderon's offensive against drug cartels. The offensive has claimed more than 7,600 lives this year, according to a tally by the El Universal newspaper. Six other cartel members and one naval petty officer also died in the raid that killed Beltran Leyva. Four members of the slain officer's family were killed earlier this month, apparently in retaliation. The Beltran Leyva cartel is known for air transportation expertise. A U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration estimate from two years ago said the group smuggled 300 to 400 kilograms of cocaine monthly into the United States. The group is also known to smuggle black tar heroin.","Medical examiner, three employees suspended pending investigation .

"(CNN) -- Honduras suspended diplomatic relations with Argentina on Tuesday in retaliation for having its ambassador expelled from Argentina last week. Riot police stand in front of marchers supporting ousted Honduran President Manuel Zelaya on Tuesday. The move stems from tensions between the two countries over a June 28 military-led coup in which Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya was replaced by congressional leader Roberto Micheletti. When Honduran Ambassador Carmen Eleonora Ortez Williams, who had been appointed by Zelaya, did not protest the coup, Argentina took exception. Most countries in the world -- as well as the United Nations, the Organization of American States and the European Union -- have denounced the coup and demanded that Zelaya be restored to power. Those nations still consider Zelaya president and do not recognize any officials from Micheletti's government or any functionaries who support him. Argentina asked Ortez to leave last week ""for supporting the de facto government of Roberto Micheletti."" On Tuesday, Honduras suspended relations with Argentina and asked the South American nation's diplomats to leave within 72 hours. Honduras' relations with Argentina will be ""channeled"" though the Argentine embassy in Israel, said a release issued in Tegucigalpa, the Honduran capital. ""With regards to Argentine personnel stationed in Tegucigalpa and who are finishing their functions in Honduras, they will be granted, based on the principle of strictest reciprocity, the same treatment, time and facilities that was conceded to Honduran functionaries accredited in Argentina,"" the Honduran release said. The Honduran political crisis stems from Zelaya's desire to hold a referendum that could have led to extending term limits by changing the constitution, despite the country's congress having outlawed the vote and the supreme court having ruled it illegal. Zelaya vowed to hold the vote anyway but was ousted before the voting started. The congress named Micheletti provisional president shortly after Zelaya was detained by the military and sent into exile. Micheletti said Zelaya was not overthrown in a coup, but rather removed from power through constitutional means.","Honduras takes action after its ambassador is expelled from Argentina .

"(CNN) -- Karim Benzema shrugged off his club troubles and a violent challenge to give France a 1-0 win over 10-man Brazil in Wednesday's prestige friendly in Paris. The Real Madrid striker netted the only goal from close range nine minutes into the second half of the rematch of the 1998 World Cup final at the same venue -- which France won 3-0. He was lucky to escape serious injury five minutes before the break when Brazil midfielder Hernanes was sent off for kicking him in the chest. Benzema has struggled to show his true form in Spain since his $48 million move in 2009, but was a constant threat after the red card and should have added more to his new tally of 12 international goals. However, his 54th-minute strike proved enough, set up by winger Jeremy Menez's burst down the right and subsequent teasing low cross. Menez was lucky to stay on the pitch after a bad tackle from behind on Brazil defender David Luiz, whose new English club Chelsea will be relieved he escaped injury. It was France's fifth consecutive win under coach Laurent Blanc, who has revived the team's fortunes after last year's first-round exit at the World Cup in South Africa. Brazil coach Mano Menezes suffered a second successive defeat following November's loss to Argentina. Also on Wednesday, two of the world's best footballers went head-to-head in neutral Switzerland, and once again Lionel Messi came out on top as Argentina snatched a last-gasp 2-1 friendly win over Portugal. His Real Madrid arch-rival Cristiano Ronaldo put the European side level in the 21st minute after Angel Di Maria's opener in Geneva, but Barcelona superstar Messi gave the South Americans the spoils with a 90th-minute penalty. The duo have matched each other almost goal for goal this season in La Liga, and Messi has the upper hand with Barcelona seven points clear and resounding 5-0 victors in the opening ""Clasico"" clash between the two clubs. And the two-time world player of the year was involved in Argentina's 14th-minute opener as he cut in from the right in trademark fashion to set up Real winger Di Maria. But Ronaldo, who followed up Messi's weekend hat-trick with a double of his own to regain top spot in the Spanish scoring charts, pounced from close range soon after from striker Hugo Almeida's flick-on. Ronaldo should have made it 2-1 soon after halftime but hit the bar from close range, then saw Almeida waste an even better opportunity before both were substituted along with Nani. But Messi stayed on the pitch until the end, and got his reward when Fabio Coentrao fouled substitute Pablo Zabaleta. In another rematch of a past World Cup final, Germany were held 1-1 at home by 1982 champions Italy. Veteran striker Miroslav Klose opened the scoring in the 16th minute after fine build-up play by Mesut Ozil and Thomas Muller, beating recalled former captain Gianluigi Buffon in goal. But Giuseppe Rossi -- who shares the surname of 1982 tournament top scorer Paolo -- snatched a late equalizer for Cesare Prandelli's team, beating keeper Manuel Neuer at the second attempt with nine minutes to play. World champions Spain beat Colombia 1-0 in Madrid thanks to an 86th-minute winner by substitute David Silva. Striker David Villa, seeking to move past Raul as Spain's record scorer, was denied his 45th international goal when he hit the post in the first half. The Netherlands, beaten in the World Cup final in South Africa last year, defeated Austria 3-1 in Eidhoven. Wesley Sneijder volleyed a 28th-minute opener before second-half goals from striker Klaas Jan Huntelaar -- his 10th goal in six matches -- and Dirk Kuyt from the penalty spot made Marko Arnautovic's late strike a mere consolation. England came from behind to beat Denmark 2-1 in Copenhagen, as Aston Villa forwards Darren Bent and Ashley Young struck in each half after Daniel Agger's early diving header. Russia suffered a shock 1-0 defeat by Iran in the United Arab Emirates, as Mohammad Reza Khalatbari netted a last-minute winner and was then sent off after being booked for celebrating. The match was reportedly watched by former Portugal coach Carlos Queiroz, who has been linked with the Iran post. South Korea, who were also in action at the Asian Cup recently, drew 0-0 with Turkey. Cameroon warmed up for next month's Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Senegal with a 1-0 win away to Macedonia, with substitute Matthew Mbuta scoring the only goal in the 75th minute in Skopje. South Africa beat Kenya 2-0 thanks to first-half goals from Davide Somma and Steven Pienaar, while Morocco defeated Niger 3-0 and Nigeria edged Sierra Leone 2-1.","France edge Brazil 1-0 in rematch of 1998 World Cup final in Paris .

"Washington (CNN) -- A new national poll suggests that as President Barack Obama prepares to try to convince a skeptical American public why the U.S. should take military action against Syria, he may be partly to blame for the box he's put himself into. The CNN/ORC poll released Tuesday indicates that Americans are divided evenly on whether Obama is a strong leader as well as whether he's honest and trustworthy. ""One concern is the messenger himself,"" CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. ""The public's split right down the middle on whether Obama is a strong leader, whether he is honest and trustworthy, and whether he inspires confidence."" Obama tells CNN a 'breakthrough' is possible on Syria . And the poll also found that only one in five say they completely understand Obama's Syria policy. A little more than half said they ""somewhat"" understand the administration's game plan and about three in 10 said they are not very clear, or don't understand at all, the administration's strategy. Obama will get the opportunity to explain the policy directly to the American people when he addresses the nation at 9 p.m. ET Tuesday. CNN Poll: Most don't approve of how Obama is handling foreign policy . War weariness is also partly to blame, the poll suggests â€” six in 10 say the Iraq war was a mistake and about half say the same thing about the war in Afghanistan. As a result, three-quarters say the U.S. shouldn't play the role of world policeman. ""The president's challenge is profound, both from a personal and from a policy standpoint,"" said CNN Chief National Correspondent John King. ""Personally the country is split on their opinion of the president, and from a policy perspective they have huge doubts right now."" Polls released on Monday showed that more than seven in 10 Americans said a strike would not achieve significant goals and a similar number said they didn't see how a strike on Syria would serve the national interest. A majority opposes Congress passing a resolution that would give Obama the authority to launch military operations against the regime of Bashar al-Assad, which Obama says is responsible for a chemical weapons attack on civilians that killed more than 1,000 people. CNN Poll: Most don't want Obama to attack Syria . Members of Congress say they're hearing that opposition from their constituents. While most members of the House and Senate say they're undecided on how they'll vote, the number of those who have made up their mind they will vote against it by far outnumber those who say they'll vote for it. The president is also up against the fact that Syria is nowhere near the top issue for most Americans. ""Syria may be the topic 24/7 on Capitol Hill and at the White House, but nearly three times as many Americans say the economy's the country's top issue than say the same about Syria,"" Holland added. The poll was conducted for CNN by ORC International September 6-8, with 1,022 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points.","Americans are evenly divided on Obama leadership qualities and whether he's trustworthy .

"(Mashable) -- Online lotteries and poker may be poised to become legal thanks to a new decision by the Justice Department reinterpreting the Wire Act of 1961. The decision, written in September but made public last Friday, found the Act's prohibition of wagers via telecommunications crossing state lines or international borders refers only to bets on a ""sporting event or contest"" and not to lottery tickets sold online. The decision doesn't mention online poker, but some reason that the ruling will pave the way for online poker. ""The United States Department of Justice has given the online gaming community a big, big present,"" Prof. I. Nelson Rose wrote on his blog, Gambling and the Law. ""If the Wire Act is limited to bets on sports events and races, what other federal anti-gambling statutes are left?"" wrote Rose. ""There are prohibitions on interstate lotteries, but Powerball and the other multi-state lotteries show how easily these can be gotten around, even before Congress passed an express exemption for state lotteries. And poker is not a lottery under federal law."" Rose continued that since the Wire Act refers to bets on an event, poker would be except because poker is itself the event. The DOJ has aggressively enforced the ban on online poker. In April, the agency shut down three foreign-based online poker firms -- Absolute Poker, Poker Stars and Full Tilt Poker -- charging that each of the companies had violated the law by serving U.S. residents. © 2013 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- Carlos Tevez scored his first Manchester City hat-trick to send Roberto Mancini's side soaring into the top four of the Premier League after a crushing 4-1 win over Blackburn. The Argentine opened the scoring in the seventh minute after goalkeeper Paul Robinson dropped Martin Petrov's corner. Benjani pounced on the loose ball and Tevez was in the right place to turn home the Zimbabwean's shot with his hip. City doubled their lead six minutes before half-time when defender Micah Richards made a superb run into the Blackburn area -- and was in the right place to fire home when Benjani's shot bounced back off  a post. Benjani also played a part in the third goal, cutting the ball back for Tevez to fire home his second early in the second half. Tevez should have had a hat-trick when he dived to reach Pablo Zabaleta's chipped cross but, with the goal at his mercy, failed to find the target. Mancini then watched his side concede for the first time since takling over from Mark Hughes four matches ago when Morten Gamst Pedersen capitalized on a errors by Vincent Kompany and Shay Given to curl home a fine shot. The scoring was not completed though. Having blown one chance of a hat-trick, Tevez did not miss a second time when he was set up in stoppage time to score his 11th goal in nine matches. The result means City jump above Tottenham into the final Champions League place, seven points behind leaders Chelsea.","Argentine striker Carlos Tevez scored his first Manchester City hat-trick .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- The owner of the stricken nuclear power complex in northeastern Japan said Saturday that it will hike the radiation exposure limit for its workers at the plant from 100 millisieverts per shift to 150 millisieverts, Japan's public broadcaster NHK reported. Tokyo Electric Power Company said some workers at the Fukushima Daiichi plant have already been exposed to more than 100 millisieverts and that the company, citing the unprecedented nature of the crisis, has raised the limit to 150 millisieverts for some outdoor workers. ""This is a considerable amount of radiation,"" said G. Donald Frey, a medical physicist and professor of radiology at the Medical University of South Carolina. ""The limit for radiation workers in the United States is 50 millisieverts per year, but we try to keep them to less than 5 millisieverts per year."" TEPCO said it is doing all it can to protect workers' health and that it will not return to the plant any worker already exposed to more than 100 millisieverts. Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency said Friday that several hundred workers, including non-TEPCO employees, remained on site. After a single acute exposure of 1,000 millisieverts, people tend to start feeling nauseated and vomiting, Frey said. At 5,000 millisieverts over the course of a few hours, ""people start dying."" After exposure to 150 millisieverts per day, ""you're definitely in the range where you have significantly increased risk of radiation-induced cancers."" For work involving recovery and restoration in an emergency operation, the International Commission on Radiological Protection recommends no more than 50 millisieverts in any given year. But in cases where the lives of a great number of people may be at stake, the ICRP says it recommends no restriction on dose as long as ""the benefit to others clearly outweighs the rescuer's risk."" TEPCO Managing Director Akio Komiri, upon leaving a news conference Friday in Fukushima at which worker exposure levels were discussed, burst into tears. The announcement came a day after the country's nuclear safety agency adjusted its assessment of the disaster. NISA raised its rating for the most serious issues from 4 to 5 -- putting those problems on par with those in the 1979 incident at Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island. TEPCO President Masataka Shimizu said Friday in a written statement that he was taking ""very seriously"" the increase in level of seriousness. ""We sincerely apologize to all the people living in the surrounding area of the power station and people in Fukushima Prefecture, as well as to the people of society for causing such great concern and nuisance,"" he said. According to the International Nuclear Events Scale, a level 5 indicates the likelihood of a release of radioactive material, several deaths from radiation and severe damage to a reactor core. Each step on the scale indicates an increase of 10 times the severity of the step below it, the International Atomic Energy Agency says. The Chernobyl nuclear accident in the former Soviet Union rated a 7, the highest level on the scale, while Japan's other nuclear crisis -- a 1999 accident at Tokaimura in which workers died after being exposed to radiation -- rated a 4. The partial meltdown of a reactor core at Three Mile Island was deemed the worst nuclear accident in U.S. history. But the rating change was not due to new problems at the plant, said Hidehiko Nishiyama, deputy head of the nuclear safety agency. In fact, the situation at the plant -- while still serious -- did not worsen Friday for the second consecutive day, according to the IAEA. The change instead came after engineers reviewed images showing damage to fuel rods and other structures inside the reactor buildings, Nishiyama said. Despite the more serious assessment, no expansion of the 20-kilometer (12.4-mile) evacuation zone was necessary, Nishiyama said Friday at a briefing. Earlier evacuation orders took into account the possibility of greater damage to the plant, he said. IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano cautioned against reading too much into the raised disaster assessment. He said it's too early to compare the plant's situation to Three Mile Island, and he said the disaster unfolding at Fukushima is not like what happened at Chernobyl. But Peter Bradford, a member of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission when the Three Mile Island incident occurred, said Fukushima is worse than TMI. ""In terms of severity, this accident left Three Mile Island in the rear-view mirror several days ago,"" he said. Amano also appeared to defend Japan's evacuation response, saying that IAEA guidelines call for exactly what Japan has ordered -- an evacuation radius of 20 kilometers in the event of a reactor meltdown and a suggestion that people 20 kilometers to 30 kilometers stay inside. U.S. officials have urged Americans to evacuate to a radius of 50 miles. The level 5 rating applies to the plant's No. 2 and No. 3 reactors. The Japanese nuclear agency assigned a rating of 3 to the problems with the used storage pool at the No. 4 reactor. That's the spent-fuel pool that a U.S. nuclear official on Wednesday said had run dry, dangerously exposing fuel to the air. Tokyo Electric Power Co. reported Friday that ""we have confirmed that the water level of the pool is secured."" The decision to raise the level was announced as Japanese authorities came under fire Friday over the lack of timely information on the unfolding disaster. People near the plant, which is 240 kilometers (150 miles) north of Tokyo, have expressed frustration over the lack of information from authorities, an official with a city government near the plant said. ""Evacuees, and that can be said of myself as well, are feeling anxious since we are not getting the needed information from the government in a timely manner,"" said Seiji Sato, a spokesman for the government of Tamura City, about 20 kilometers from the nuclear facility. Work at the plant Friday focused on restoring electricity and trying to fill the spent-fuel storage pool at the No. 3 reactor. Soldiers and utility employees sprayed about 50 tons of water from seven fire trucks into the No. 3 reactor building in an effort to refill the pool there, Kyodo News reported. It was unclear how effective the effort was, said Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano. ""We observed vapor after the water was (shot in), so we believe that water did reach the pool, for sure,"" he said. The storage pool at the No. 4 reactor also remains a concern, Graham Andrew, special assistant to the IAEA director, told reporters Friday. But efforts to cool three damaged reactors with sea water appeared to be working, Andrew said. Despite damage to the nuclear core at each reactor, each appeared relatively stable, the IAEA reported. Of the plant's other three reactors, one had no fuel in it and two were being cooled by emergency generators that crews got working on Friday, the IAEA said. They were helping restore water to the reactors' spent-fuel ponds and lower the reactors' temperature, the agency reported. The effort to restore offsite power to the site also continued. Officials had hoped to have power to part of the plant restored by Friday, but the work was progressing slower than expected, they said. Japanese officials have studied a plan to dump tons of sand and concrete on the plant to encase it, putting out any fires and preventing further radiation from escaping, Nishiyama said. But he said they have ruled out such a course as ""not a realistic option"" and will focus instead on restoring power and cooling fuel. Significant amounts of radiation were released after the 9.0-magnitude earthquake on March 11 was followed by a tsunami that knocked out the plant's backup power generators. Radiation levels Thursday hit 20 millisieverts per hour at an annex building where workers have been trying to re-establish electrical power, ""the highest registered (at that building) so far,"" a Tokyo Electric official told reporters. By comparison, the typical resident of a developed country is naturally exposed to 3 millisieverts per year. The company said Friday afternoon, though, that radiation levels at the plant's west gate, at 0.26 to 0.27 millisieverts, had been fairly stable over the prior 12 hours. As of Friday, monitoring of radiation levels at 47 sites across Japan showed minor increases in radiation, but at doses that are ""far from levels which would require action,"" Andrew said. An initial sampling of the air in Tokyo by IAEA monitors on Friday found no evidence of radioactive materials there, Andrew said. A second sampling was scheduled for Saturday.

"Washington (CNN) -- Passengers are not allowed to carry guns onto airplanes, yet the Transportation Security Administration finds hundreds of weapons each year. In 2012 more than 1,500 firearms were discovered by screeners at airport checkpoints, TSA spokesman David Castelveter said. That is an average of more than four weapons a day. iReport: Was your gun banned? A total of 1,320 firearms were found in 2011. Many were loaded, and some had rounds in the chamber. ""We do assume that the vast majority of weapons that come through are (from) people who didn't know they couldn't carry them on or were not aware they were in the bag,"" Castelveter said. Through the end of November, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport led the nation with 80 guns found. The top five airports also included Dallas/Fort Worth International with a total of 75 firearms, Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport with 50, George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston with 48, and Denver International Airport with 36. Read more: FBI gun background checks hit record highs . It's not clear whether the increase in the number of guns found in 2012 is due to more people traveling with weapons or TSA screeners and new screening technologies doing a better job of finding them. When firearms are found at a checkpoint, the TSA calls local police who determine whether the passenger should be arrested, ticketed or have their gun returned. ""They can be permitted to take the weapon back to (their) car and come back,"" Castelveter said. ""If it is illegal (to have the weapon in that locality), then it is confiscated by law enforcement."" Watch: Giving up guns . Under TSA rules, guns are allowed in checked baggage in locked, hard-sided containers. They must be unloaded and declared to the airline, and passengers must follow local gun laws. Guns, ammunition, firearm parts and even realistic replicas cannot be carried on the plane. Guns are not the only weapons banned from the passenger areas of planes. The TSA blog highlights a wide variety of prohibited items discovered in carry-on bags. Poll: Majority favors gun restrictions . In the first week of December, passengers tried to take 40 stun guns through checkpoints. The next week, a walking cane with a sword inside was found, and in the week before Christmas, a spear gun was discovered. In addition, four inert grenades were found inside carry-ons.","Many of the guns discovered at checkpoints were loaded, according to the TSA .

"London (CNN) -- Samsung has launched its Galaxy S III smartphone, which it hopes will help solidify the company as the leading challenger to Apple and its iPhone 4S. The new handset, with a whopping 4.8-inch screen and an 8-megapixel camera, was unveiled at a slick launch party in London on Thursday, complete with a backing orchestra. Billed by Samsung as having been ""designed for humans,"" the phone features voice and eye-recognition technology that the company hopes will set the handset ahead of its rivals in the crowded smartphone market. Samsung has overtaken Nokia as the world's best-selling mobile phone maker, and Juniper Research reported Tuesday that Samsung also overtook Apple in smartphone sales in the first quarter, in what it described as ""increasingly a two-horse race."" Opinion: Samsung Galaxy S III won't be for everyone . The new Galaxy handset, which runs the most up-to-date version of Google's mobile operating system -- Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich -- recognizes when a user is looking at it, and ensures the screen doesn't go dark while it has eye contact. S Voice technology -- Samsung's equivalent of Apple's Siri -- enables users to wake up their phone with a simple voice command. And voice recognition goes further -- saying: ""Hi Galaxy ... picture,"" for example, opens the phone's camera app, and saying ""cheese"" takes a picture. Face-recognition software then identifies Facebook friends within images, and prompts the user to share them. Samsung -- a sponsor of the Olympics -- revealed it will be sending devices enabled with mobile payment technology to the 2012 games in London. Chris Hall, editor of technology website Pocket-lint, said he was ""pleasantly surprised"" by the new phone. ""When you compare it to the nearest rival it feels like they have pulled off a bit of a trick,"" he said. ""They have put some effort into software innovations, particularly the eye recognition. The voice recognition feels like a reaction to Siri on the iPhone, but I don't know many people who actually talk to their phones."" ""I think the success of the Galaxy S II proves people want something different that isn't an iPhone, and I think the S III is a valid successor to the S II."" Samsung said the phone will be available in Europe on May 29, followed by launches in Asia, Africa and Latin America. A 4G version will go on sale in North America, Japan and South Korea in the summer. Samsung did not announce what prices on the phone are expected to be.","Samsung Galaxy S III smartphone unveiled Thursday in London .

"(CNN) -- Here's some good news, a year after Newtown: . States have been restoring funds for mental health coverage. States are the main providers of mental health services. In the recession of 2008-2009, the states together cut $1.8 billion from mental health budgets, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, an advocacy group. Over the past year, 36 states have added money back. Texas just legislated the largest increase in mental health coverage in the state's history, $259 million more over the next two years than over the previous two. Private dollars may soon flow, too: the Affordable Care Act requires insurers to expand their coverage of mental health problems. States have passed laws intended to prevent the mentally ill from doing harm. New York adopted the most sweeping legislation. The NYSAFE Act, as it's known, requires all mental health professionals to report patients who, in the professional's opinion, seem likely to present a risk of serious harm to themselves or others. State police can then check these reports and deny or revoke a gun license. Connecticut and Colorado have also stiffened mental health reporting requirements. Now the sobering news: . Mental health professionals can't report dangerous people if they don't come into contact with them in the first place. Professionals are in short supply. Insurance coverage has historically been thin. Those who most need mental health help are precisely those least likely to seek or accept it. Even if the dangerous mentally ill can be identified, the facilities to protect society have been reduced to desperate inadequacy. In 1959, state mental hospitals housed about 559,000 patients. A generation later, the mental hospital population had dwindled to 70,000 people. This trend is called ""deinstitutionalization,"" but that's an inapt term. The mentally ill do often end up inside institutions: prisons. Almost 1.3 million mentally ill people are held in prisons and jails. Few of these people are adequately treated, and they often emerge more troubled and dangerous. Even if authorities can identify a potentially dangerous mentally ill person and do revoke that person's gun license, the sheer superabundance of guns in the United States puts weapons in easy reach of anyone who wants them. The guns that Adam Lanza used at Sandy Hook were bought by his mother, who could have passed any background check. A society with a lot of guns is going to have a lot of shootings, no matter what else it does for the mentally ill -- especially since the most common form of gun violence is not homicide but suicide. The self-slaughter of a chronically depressed person is a mental health failure, too. A stronger mental health system is not an alternative to gun safety laws. It must operate in tandem with them. That lesson was written in blood at Newtown, yet it remains unlearned to this day. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum: The good news, a year after Newton, is growing state spending on mentally ill .
Yet such worthy efforts won't stop some troubled people from gun violence, he says .

"(CNN) -- When it comes to football, the New York-New Jersey divide is a long and complicated one. Both New York-branded NFL teams -- the Jets and the Giants -- share fans from across the tri-state area, blurring state lines and loyalties. And both teams play at Metlife Stadium in New Jersey, where the Super Bowl will be held February 2. The official Super Bowl Host Committee estimates the game will bring in between $550 and $600 million in revenue to New York and New Jersey. In addition to the influx of Super Bowl-goers eating and staying in the region, there will be concerts, meet-and-greet events with the players and even a toboggan set up smack in the middle of Times Square. But James Cassella, the mayor of East Rutherford, New Jersey, where the game will be played, said it's unlikely his town will cash in much. ""I'm hoping that we at least break even,"" said Cassella, who has been mayor of the town of 9,000 for 19 years. Tax revenue from the town's five hotels will provide a slight bump for East Rutherford, but Cassella is skeptical that it will reap many more benefits. Game-day transportation is set up so visitors must enter MetLife Stadium by bus or train. Cassella said he doubts local businesses will see significant gains from spectators. The town also has had to ramp up its police presence for the week. ""This has already cost us,"" he said, adding that even though the event is in New Jersey, ""It's a New York event."" ""People (of East Rutherford) are proud to say there will be 150 million people watching and looking at East Rutherford, even though all the outside shots will be of New York City,"" Cassella said. The NFL dismisses the theory that the Super Bowl is a New York-centric event. ""There are more activities in New Jersey than New York,"" NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said. The players are staying in Jersey City and all their media appearances and training will be held in the state. Still, the issue is sensitive for some. On Monday, U.S. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey corrected one of his Twitter followers who tweeted the incorrect location of the game. ""NO! The Super Bowl is in New Jersey,"" he responded. At a press conference on Thursday, U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey scoffed at the NFL's official Super Bowl program cover, which shows the Vince Lombardi trophy with New York as its backdrop. A small sliver of New Jersey can be seen in the background. ""For all of those who are geographically challenged, welcome to New Jersey, welcome to the home of Super Bowl XLVIII,"" he said. The so-called Super Bowl Boulevard will be across the Hudson River from MetLife Stadium, in midtown Manhattan. Parts of Manhattan, including the stretch of Broadway from 34th to 47th streets, will be closed to traffic from January 26 through February 2 to make room for a toboggan run, a concert stage and an exhibit featuring the Vince Lombardi Trophy. Mayor Bill de Blasio said the Super Bowl is ""hugely important"" for New York and he believes the event will be ""an extraordinary moment for New York City."" De Blasio will be involved in Super Bowl festivities in some capacity, although it's unclear whether he will attend the game, said Marti Adams, chief spokesperson for the mayor. Cassella, East Rutherford's mayor, said he has not been invited to the game. He plans to attend a community tailgating party and then watch from home. ""I'll be sitting in my recliner,"" he said, ""enjoying the game.""","New York and New Jersey fight for profits from Super Bowl XLVIII .

"(CNN) -- A third person, identified as a minor girl, died from injuries suffered in the Asiana Airlines crash last week, hospital officials said. She had been in critical condition at the Bay Area hospital since the July 6 crash, San Francisco General spokeswoman Rachael Kagan said . The hospital didn't release any additional information about her -- including her name, age or ethnicity -- in keeping with her parents' wishes. ""It's a very, very sad day today at San Francisco General Hospital,"" said Dr. Geoffrey Manley, chief of neurosurgery. ""We have all done everything we could."" Q&A: How does an air crash investigation work? Two others -- both 16-year-old girls from China -- were reported dead soon after the Boeing 777 crash-landed at San Francisco International Airport. One of those teenagers was hit on the runway by a fire truck, though it's unclear whether she was already dead when she was struck, San Francisco police spokesman Albie Esparza said. At the time, firefighters were using flame retardant that ended up surrounding areas immediately around the plane with foam, Esparza said. ""When the truck repositioned itself to get a better aim of the fuselage, they discovered the body of the victim in the fresh track from the path of the truck,"" he added. The foam was thick enough to cover a body, Esparza noted. Moreover, it is difficult for those in the ""industrial-size"" fire trucks that responded to crash to see things on the ground, the police spokesman said. ""Right now, we are waiting results from the coroner to determine if she died from the crash or the fire engine going over her,"" the police spokesman said. ""And that will be part of our investigations, like any other case, by our hit-and-run and major accidents investigations teams."" Of the passengers and crew on board, 304 people survived -- 123 of whom walked away relatively unscathed. The others were sent to hospitals. Opinion: Our terror over flying has cost us . A handful of them remained hospitalized, including six patients at San Francisco General. That hospital's figure includes two adults in critical condition with spinal cord injuries, abdominal injuries, internal bleeding, road rash and fractures. San Francisco International Airport is also working to get back to normal. The plane's fuselage was hauled away on flatbed trucks Friday to a remote section of the airport, San Francisco International Airport said in a news release. On Friday, a Southwest Airlines jet landed on the runway where the crash occurred -- signifying that, for the first time in six days, all four of the airport's runways were operational. ""The tremendous efforts and around-the-clock work of airport staff, government agencies, airline tenants and contractors allowed us to complete all repairs and safety certifications for Runway 28L in a timely and efficient manner,"" airport director John L. Martin said. While the wreckage has been hauled away, investigators still have not pinpointed exactly why Flight 214 crashed, or who was to blame. Did Asiana pilot have enough 777 experience? An in-depth review of the cockpit voice recorder shows two pilots called for the landing to be aborted before the plane hit a seawall and crashed onto the runway, the head of the National Transportation Safety Board said. The first internal call by one of the three pilots in the cockpit to abort the landing came three seconds before the crash. A second call was made by another pilot 1.5 seconds before impact, NTSB chief Deborah Hersman said. The agency has begun wrapping up its investigation at the airport, and crews are cleaning up the debris left by the crash. Investigators turned the runway back over to the airport. CNN's Chelsea J. Carter, Augie Martin and Ed Payne contributed to this report.","All four runways at San Francisco's airport are now operational, airport says .

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods produced some of his best golf to give himself a massive lead heading into final round of the BMW Championship as broke the Cog Hill course record. Woods carded a course-record 62 in the third round of the BMW Championship at Cog Hill, Illinois. The world number one had been tied at the top of the leaderboard with fellow- American Mark Wilson after the second round, but pulled clear of the field after he carded a course-record third round 62. Woods had a 16-under total of 197, seven shots ahead of American Brandt Snedeker, who carded a 66, and Australian Marc Leishman, who posted a 68. Ireland's Padraig Harrington hit a 69 for 205 and is next in line with American Matt Kuchar, who shot a round of 66. The Illinois course has proved a popular hunting ground for Woods who is a four-time winner of the event and his impressive nine-under round included a superb eagle at the ninth. Woods' round broke the previous record of 62 at the course, while he also equaled the tournament record which had been set by Jim Furyk at Bellerive in September 2008, and he admitted something just clicks when he plays the Cog Hill course. ""I played here even as an amateur in the old Western Open - I've always felt comfortable playing this golf course - I've always liked it,"" Woods told the PGA Tour Web site. ""Even though the golf course has changed this year for us, the routing is still the same, and I've always felt comfortable playing this golf course for some reason, and even though, for instance, they changed Torrey Pines South, I still feel comfortable on the property. And this is very similar to that. ""The round just kind of built upon itself. I bogeyed one right out of the gate and birdied three to get back. It just kind of built it over itself. I made a nice save there at five after hitting a really good drive, landed in the fairway and kind of ran into an impossible spot. ""Birdieing six and then good save at seven, it kind of just built. And then going birdie-eagle to finish off the front nine, you're always can make up shot from eight to 11, and I did today. ""The only hole I didn't take care of was 10. I wanted to hit wedge in there so bad, but coming out of the first cut, I wanted to take over the green out of play, and I came up a little bit short."" Woods added: ""I did drive well today. I've driven it good all week. Actually the last few weeks I've felt like I've driven the ball much better. ""You know, when I'm able to get it down there, obviously with my length, I can get in there with some shorter clubs. This golf course has allowed me to kind of get down there a little bit. ""When we were playing at Liberty National, it was kind of hard to get the ball down there. It just didn't fit. Some of the tees were up and some of the angles just didn't quite fit. But this golf course, it fits."" The $7.5 million tournament is the third event in the US PGA Tour's FedEx Cup playoff series and a victory for Woods would put him back at the top of the standings after he relinquished the place to Steve Stricker last week.","Tiger Woods hit a course-record 62 to take control of the BMW Championship .

"London (CNN) -- Moments after Michael Adebolajo had nearly decapitated his victim, the British soldier Drummer Lee-Rigby, he turned to one of the numerous cameras trained on him and his accomplice Michael Adebowale, and said: . ""The only reason we have killed this man today is because Muslims are dying daily by British soldiers. And this British soldier is one. It is an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. We swear by the almighty Allah we will never stop fighting you until you leave us alone."" Here Adebolajo was, perhaps unwittingly, following one of the oldest philosophies in modern terrorism: the propaganda of the deed. Conceptualized by Russian and Italian anarchists during the mid to late 19th century, it refers to the terrorist's belief in the didactic power of violence which they see as necessary not only to draw attention to a cause but to inform and educate people about their movement in the hope that it will encourage increased recruitment. Thus, Rigby's killers did not attack the shocked and curious passers-by in Woolwich who began to film them, and instead invited the curious gaze of their smart phones. This murder was not an irrational act of madness, but a calm and calculated effort both to strike a blow for what they see as Muslims oppressed by Western forces around the world, and to publicize the cause of the global jihad far and wide. In order to maintain a presence in the West, the global jihad movement that was sparked by al Qaeda on September 11, 2001 requires effective propagandists. Such individuals help to define grievances, as well as formulate responses and offer motivation. In doing so, they are able to offer a version of global jihadist ideology that resonates with the experiences of Muslims living in the West. While Adebolajo should not be seen as a key leadership figure or propagandist, his act should be regarded in the same light. Indeed, Adebolajo was also known among members of the extremist group which radicalized him for giving sermons on street corners, where he would emulate well-known propagandists, seeking to replicate their work on a smaller scale. In a 2009 video which emerged after Rigby's murder, he is shown leading his group's protests against an anti-Muslim organization that was calling for the shut-down of a mosque in north London. ""They are pigs,"" he shouted, referring to the anti-Muslim demonstrators, while also encouraging his audience to ""not be scared of the kuffar [unbelievers]."" The Woolwich attackers emerged from an ideological milieu which sees the West as engaged in wide- ranging efforts to destroy Islam and subjugate Muslims. In response, members of this milieu support acts of violence. Some believe that this violence only has a place in warzones involving Muslims, while others add to their target list the home soil of the Western countries involved in these conflicts. Adebolajo and Adebowale are clearly from the latter category, and so would have been many of those with whom they interacted on a regular basis. However, when faced with a grouping like this, it is often very difficult for security services to determine which among them will graduate from non-violent activism of the sort that Adebolajo was engaged with in 2009, and take part in violence. Adebolajo, however, had already been known to authorities as he was arrested by Kenyan security forces in 2010 after travelling there with the intention of joining the Somali al Qaeda-linked militia Al-Shabaab. This act of mobilization should have made him stand out from his British extremist peers as among the most likely to carry out an attack on home soil, and yet it appears he was allowed back onto the streets of London without any sort of monitoring of his movements. The details behind why he was not charged or extensively monitored after attempting to join a proscribed terrorist group are unknown, but British authorities have faced some awkward questions about this revelation. In future, an attempt to join up with a global jihadist group abroad, while not necessarily an indicator of a desire to take part in violence back home, should nonetheless be regarded as a step in the wrong direction. When looking at how authorities can respond to the wider problem of homegrown radicalization and the role of propagandists, one should begin with accepting the limitations of what can be done. What Adebolajo and Adebowale did last spring is, at least in a planning and execution sense, incredibly easy to replicate and difficult to detect and protect against. Thus, no government should be expected to fully guarantee against similar attacks in the future. The propagandists who assist in domestic radicalization often do not directly call for violence and stay within the legal parameters of free speech. Nonetheless, either via the Internet or in face-to-face interactions they use highly inflammatory language and promote extreme interpretations of Islam, both of which play a role in the radicalization process. In order to protect against this, Western countries could seek to pursue legislation that curbs free speech or censors the web. The question is how much do we want our society to change in response to this ongoing threat? Attacks like that in Woolwich are relatively rare in the West. This is instructive, and should serve as a reminder that we are dealing with an extremist minority that cannot simply be ignored or erased from our consciousness through bans and proscriptions. The strength of a truly liberal society is not based on its ability to ban things which it doesn't like, but on the power of its ideas to equip the vast majority of its population with the ability to recognise, reject and confront illiberal and violent ideologies. Rigby and others like him have paid the ultimate price for our open society, as will others in the future. This is not, however, a call for a grim acceptance of the status quo. It is a realistic assessment of the threat we face, and there is still much that can be done without infringing on basic liberties. Civil society is key here, and we must seek to further cultivate strategies that help to delegitimize illiberal ideologies such as global jihadism in the eyes of vulnerable Western Muslims. It is our responsibility to make sure that the deaths of Rigby and others will never be in vain, and use events such as Woolwich as catalysts to develop strong responses to this threat without compromising the very foundations of our society.

"(CNN) -- The Pentagon took issue Friday with the Afghan government's claim that there was a lack of evidence against 65 prisoners released this week over staunch U.S. objections. ""All of these individuals are people who should not be walking the streets,"" said Rear Adm. John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman. ""And we had strong evidence on all of them, evidence that has been ignored, and that's unsatisfactory to us."" He added that the prisoners posed threats not just to U.S. forces, but also civilians, as many of the prisoners were accused of killing innocent Afghans as well. The U.S. military in Afghanistan has said some of the men are linked to attacks that killed or wounded 32 American or coalition service members and 23 Afghan security personnel or civilians. ""They're still very dangerous individuals who should have remained locked up,"" Kirby said. ""There's not going to be an active targeting campaign ... to go after them. That said, if they choose to return to the fight, they become legitimate enemies and legitimate targets."" Mohammad Ishaq Aloko, the Afghan attorney general, said Thursday that the decision to release the prisoners was made ""according to our law,"" and Abdul Shukor Dadras, head of the Afghan Review Board, said the attorney general ordered the releases from the Parwan Detention Center -- formerly known as Bagram prison -- after a careful review of 88 cases. In a statement posted on its website, the U.S. Embassy in Kabul called the move ""deeply regrettable,"" saying the Afghan government ""bears responsibility for the results of its decision."" Kirby suggested the move by the Afghan government endangers the military mission there and is ""unhelpful to the relationship that, that we want to have with Afghanistan."" He said that Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel feels that this decision, along with other recent decisions made by Kabul ""make it that much harder for many of those on the Hill in Congress to further support the Afghan missions."" A 23-page document obtained by CNN Pentagon Correspondent Barbara Starr from a U.S. military official who asked not to be identified said about 19 of the released men were associated with direct attacks that killed or wounded 60 U.S. or coalition force members. There was no immediate explanation for the discrepancy. According to the document, 25 of the men were linked to the production or placement of IEDs; 33 tested positive for explosive residue when processed after capture; and 26 were associated with attacks that killed or wounded 57 Afghan citizens and Afghan National Security Forces. Prior to the prisoners' release, U.S. authorities had repeatedly aired their displeasure over the plans. ""We have made clear our judgment that these individuals should be prosecuted under Afghan law. We requested that the cases be carefully reviewed,"" the U.S. military said ahead of the release. ""But the evidence against them was never seriously considered, including by the attorney general, given the short time since the decision was made to transfer these cases to the Afghan legal system."" NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said he was ""gravely concerned"" by the decision, ""which appears to have been made based on political calculations and without regard for due process before the Afghan courts."" In a statement, he called it ""a major step backwards for the rule of law in Afghanistan."" The U.S. military noted that the group included an alleged Taliban explosives expert, a suspected Haqqani network commander and a specialist accused of building and placing improvised explosive devices. Afghan President Hamid Karzai defended the releases and slammed the United States for criticizing them. ""Afghanistan is a sovereign country,"" he said. ""If the Afghan authorities decide to release a prisoner, it is of no concern to the U.S. and should be of no concern to the U.S. And I hope that the United States would stop harassing Afghanistan's procedures and judicial authority and I hope that the United States will now begin to respect Afghan sovereignty.""

"(CNN) -- Barcelona and Real Madrid have been fined for breaking Spain's anti-competition laws when agreeing a television deal for their domestic league and cup soccer matches. The two clubs, along with Sevilla and Racing Santander, must pay almost €8.5 million ($11.5 million) between them, while TV production company Mediapro has been fined €6.5 million ($8.8 million). They were found guilty by Spain's National Markets and Competition Commission (CNMC) of agreeing a TV rights deal of longer than the stipulated three years. In 2010, the clubs agreed four-year contracts with Mediapro. Real was fined €3.9 million ($5.28 million), Sevilla €900,000 ($1.21 million) and Santander €30,000 ($40,624) -- all in line with the values of their respective contracts. La Liga champion Barca said Monday it intends to appeal its €3.6 million ($4.87 million) fine within the allowed two-month window, but would pay despite it having ""an economic impact"" on this season's operations ""subject to a favorable ruling on future courts involving the refund of payment made."" ""FC Barcelona's appeal is based on the consideration that the signing of the contract was consistent with the provisions of the General Law on Audiovisual Communication, and also that the contract of assignment of rights mentioned has not affected in practice the audiovisual market,"" its website reported. ""The contract was signed by the previous Board, dated June 9, 2010, four days before the presidential elections. That decision was challenged by some candidates."" Sandro Rosell, Barca's current club president, took over from Joan Laporta -- whose reign lasted from 2003-10. Spanish clubs, unlike those in other top European leagues, do not have collective television agreements. Real and Barca hold 50% of the top division's TV income, with the other half shared among the other 18 clubs. It has helped the leading duo not only dominate the domestic competition, but also become two of the world's most wealthy clubs -- allowing Real to splash out $132 million on Gareth Bale in August while also tying star player Cristiano Ronaldo to a lucrative new long-term contract worth a reported $206 million. Barca's financial resources are not quite so deep, though have improved since accepting shirt sponsorship for the first time in 2010 with the Qatar Foundation -- a five-year deal reportedly worth up to $225 million. The club signed Brazil star Neymar for $75 million in May. The CNMC said in a statement explaining the ruling that the four clubs and Mediapro had committed ""a very serious offense"" by breaking its April 14, 2010 ruling on the acquisition of broadcasting rights for football competitions.","Four Spanish clubs fined over four-year TV rights deal with Mediapro .

"(CNN) -- In European soccer, the punishment for racially abusing an opponent is a 10-match ban. In American football, the same offense could result in the offending team being penalized 15 yards. That's the proposal on the table when the NFL's Competitions Committee meets next week, as the body considers penalizing players for using abusive language during games. High on the list of derogatory slurs the NFL is trying to outlaw is use of the 'N-word', while penalties for homophobic comments are also being discussed. A second incident could result in ejection. ""It is a potential rule modification being discussed by our Competition Committee,"" the NFL statement read. ""The committee has not decided on a formal proposal to our clubs, who have to approve rule changes by a 3/4 vote (24 of 32 teams). ""Rule change proposals are presented to our teams at our annual league meeting in late March. ""The game officials already have substantial authority to police verbal abuse/unsportsmanlike conduct and they understand the league's focus on respect."" Should the Competitions Committee decide to approve the proposal, the body will then present their findings to the NFL's owners at a meeting in March. Racism became a major issue in the NFL last year after the Miami Dolphins suspended offensive lineman Richie Incognito for detrimental conduct following allegations of misconduct from teammate Jonathan Martin. An independent investigation found continuing threats and verbal and physical abuse, text messages, racial slurs and vulgar sexual comments made about Martin's mother and sister by Incognito and some of his Dolphins teammates. Another Dolphins player, an unnamed offensive lineman, was allegedly subjected to homophobic name calling and improper physical touching. Incognito's lawyer said the report is replete with errors, adding: ""The truth....is that Jonathan Martin was never bullied by Richie Incognito or any member of the Dolphins' Offensive line,"" said Attorney Mark Schamel, in a statement to CNN. In Europe, racism generated plenty of unwanted headlines throughout 2013 - a year which featured two walk-offs involving famous Italian side AC Milan. Former Ghana international Kevin-Prince Boateng led his team off during a friendly against lower tier Pro Patria in January, while Guinea's Kevin Constant simply left the pitch himself in a separate incident during a match against Serie A side Sassuolo in July. One of the most high profile cases came in 2011 when Liverpool star Luis Suarez was banned for eight games after a football association panel found him guilty of racially abusing Manchester United's Patrice Evra. In Italy, several clubs have been punished after their fans were adjudged to have racially abused visiting players - with Lazio alone having paid $300,000 in fines last year after being charged four times by European football's governing body UEFA. Last year, UEFA announced that players and officials will face a 10-match ban if found guilty of racist abuse. Hidden Dangers? In the United States, Ozzie Newscome -- general manager of the Baltimove Ravens and a member of the NFL's competition committee -- believes the proposals need thorough testing before any implementation. ""With any rule that we put into play, we have to look at it from A to Z and find out what are the unintended consequences as much as the consequences,"" he was quoted as saying on the NFL website. ""But as it was stated in our meeting, there are mics everywhere. So, if something is being said, it's probably going to be captured somewhere. So, it would be an opportunity to get it verified if we had to."" Last week, the head of the Fritz Pollard Alliance, an organization dedicated to promoting diversity and equality of job opportunity in the NFL, said he would be surprised should the move fail to go through. ""I will be totally shocked if the competition committee does not uphold us on what we're trying to do,"" said John Wooten, the group's Chairman, in an interview with CBSSports.com. ""We want this word to be policed from the parking lot to the equipment room to the locker room. Secretaries, PR people, whoever, we want it eliminated completely and want it policed everywhere."" Last December, shortly after the Incognito story broke, Fritz Pollard called on NFL players to stop using the 'N-word'. ""Simply put, from this day forward please choose to not use the ""N"" word. Period!,"" their statement read. ""Do not take the position that you are not bothered by the word. If you tolerate the language being used casually now, at some point in the future, either as a current or former player, you may hear it directed at you. How do you think you will respond?"" In an interview with ESPN, Pittsburgh Steelers safety Ryan Clark, explained that the use of racial slurs is not always as it seems. ""I think it's going to be really tough to legislate this rule, to find a way to penalize everyone who uses this word,"" said Clark. ""And it's not going to be white players using it toward black players. Most of the time you hear it, it's black players using the word.""","NFL Committee to decide on whether to punish slurs with on-pitch penalties .

"(CNN) -- They've sold millions of albums and DVDs and show no signs of slowing. Much more than an overnight sensation like ""Tickle Me Elmo,"" ""The Wiggles,"" have stayed a children's favorite for 16 years. Sybil Lane, right, and her family met the Wiggles after Sam Moran stepped into his role yellow Wiggle. The Wiggles, an Australian band, impart lessons through their songs and performances that some mothers happily admit have helped shape their little ones' views on life. Sybil Lane says that her 6-year-old son Brendan ""has a very positive outlook on life, and I think the Wiggles helped him develop that."" Lane explains that the band members are positive role models who don't wear makeup or dress up. ""They are themselves,"" she says, ""and children can relate to them."" Three of the four founding members of the Wiggles met one another at the Macquarie University Institute for Early Childhood Studies in Sydney. They take their influence on their listeners seriously. One of their campaigns is to teach children the benefits of healthy eating. That lesson has rubbed off on 4-year-old Jeffrey Thompson, who, according to his mom Krista, drinks only water after hearing the Wiggles song ""Gulp Gulp Drink Some Water."" ""He drinks milk at bedtime, but other than that, it's only water."" Jeffrey is so enamored of the Wiggles that he has adopted an Australian accent which his mom says is ""cute as all heck in a 4-year-old."" Carolina Wiegers says that her 4-year-old son Andrew has picked up some Australian pronunciations, too.  She also credits the Wiggles with helping him learn routines and retain lessons. Andrew exercises his memory learning Wiggles dance routines and memorizing songs. She appreciates the content that her son is absorbing,  and likens the Wiggles to ""the teacher that wants to do all the cool stuff and has the money to do it."" She says that their DVDs and live shows have an instructive atmosphere and ""aren't really random at all."" Live shows are an important part of Wiggles culture; Brendan Lane has been to 41 shows. Wiggles parents are ""kind of a community. We catch up with each other at shows, and talk almost daily on Wiggles message boards,"" says Sharon Spray. Suzy Cato's daughter, Catie, has Angelman syndrome, with symptoms such as impaired speech and development skills. Cato says that because of her daughter's disabilities, Catie ""doesn't really show a lot of preference for things. But when she sees the Wiggles she gets very excited. We're going to go see more Wiggles shows. Its one thing my daughter loves so much, I just want to keep doing it for her."" Catie, who is 16, has met the Wiggles several times because of the band's practice of holding personal meet-and-greets with disabled or sick children. Jennifer Zink, whose 3-year-old son Max is autistic and also a huge Wiggles fan, has met the Wiggles three times. Zink explains that once The Wiggles meet a child they arrange future meet-and-greets so that they can keep up with children. Because of this personal contact, many children have developed a strong connection to Greg Page, the original yellow Wiggle. On November 29, 2006, Page announced that he was retiring because of health complications and would be passing his yellow ""skivvy,"" or shirt, off to former Wiggles background dancer Sam Moran. For Andrew Weigers, the news of Page's departure came as a bit of a shock. His mom Carolina says Sam was so upset about Greg's departure that she almost felt bad for telling him about it. It's understandable that children developed such an attachment to Page; he was the voice of the Wiggles for so long. Jenifer Zink describes the first time she and her son Max saw Page perform live. ""My son and I both were absolutely mesmerized by his voice, his charisma, his style, and the way he interacted with the crowd. From that moment, I knew that he was something special!"" By many accounts, though, Page's replacement Sam Moran seems to be holding up well as the Wiggles new lead man. ""Greg left him some hard shoes to fill,"" Sybil Lane says, but he seems very natural in that job."" And quite a job it is. Some would say that Wiggles mania has reached fever pitch. Christine Kielbasa compared watching children react to seeing the Wiggles live to watching the crowd at a Beatles show. ""I must admit I was a little excited myself,"" she confesses. Linda Nuzzo saw her first Wiggles show in 2001, in the basement of a small Australian church in New York. ""You could almost touch them,"" she says. ""And then to see them perform at Madison Square Garden, it was amazing."" And after all of their success? ""They are still down-to- earth, nice people,"" Nuzzo says.

"London (CNN) -- The former British Prime Minister, Sir John Major, has credited the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, William and Catherine, with reinvigorating interest in the British monarchy. Speaking about the couple's wedding last year he told CNN: ""It was a truly lovely day and I think the whole world saw that. And of course, that helps."" Major also acted as a guardian for Prince William's interests after his mother died and maintains close links with the monarchy. In 2005 he was made a Knight of the Garter which is the highest honor the Queen can bestow. Major told CNN: ""People see that iconic figures -- whom they see only at a distance and they perhaps never meet -- have the same emotions, same feelings, the same cares, the same loves that they have in their own lives. I think the Royal Family has communicated that better in the last couple of decades than perhaps at any earlier time in our history and it has had an impact."" Major notes how Prince William in particular has helped modernize the family's image: ""People are very happy with the way he has risen to the challenges he faced and I think even more than that, they see him as a very human individual and I think that is very important."" William is a search and rescue pilot for the Royal Air Force and must decide soon if he wants to stay on in the service for another three years. ""I think his service career is something that matters a very great deal to him, as it does to Prince Harry. So I think he is well aware of the responsibilities that lie ahead but there's a greater freedom these days for members of the Royal Family to pursue their own lives than perhaps there has been sometimes in the past and in the case of Prince William, he's pursuing that in terms of his military career,"" Major said. And what of the newest addition to the royal family? ""I think that Catherine has been faultless so far and I think the whole world has seen that,"" says Major. A royal source told CNN last month that Queen Elizabeth II has given the Duchess of Cambridge a lot of time as she settles in to the family. Major adds: ""Of course she wants her grandson and her grandson's wife to be successful and of course she offers help and they'd be foolish not to take it. Now plainly, one can, even looking from the outside, see what a good relationship actually exists there and one forgets sometimes."" The former prime minister says the Catherine has handled the pressure of her high profile brilliantly. ""It isn't easy -- suddenly to find yourself the focus of world attention, to find whatever you do is the subject of publicity, whatever you wear is the subject of comment. It's not easy at all. It's a tremendous imposition suddenly. It takes a lot to get used to but she has very good advice and I think she has handled it as well as it could possibly have been handled.""

"(CNN) -- It's a Friday in May, 2005, and Schapelle Corby stands in the center of packed courtroom on the tropical island of Bali, waiting to learn her fate. Will the beauty school student from Australia's Gold Coast be found guilty of smuggling a large bag of marijuana into Indonesia -- where the maximum penalty for drug trafficking is death by firing squad? A furrow forms between the 27-year-old's eyebrows as the judge reads out the verdict in Bahasa Indonesia. Corby appears confused. Her piercing blue eyes dart around the room -- at her family, at the cameras broadcasting live to televisions around Australia, at the ground, at her interpreter. Then reality sets in. Guilty -- the judge said. Her sentence? Twenty years in a Bali prison. At the back of the court, members of her family erupt with anger. ""It's not alright! How dare you?"" screams her sister, Mercedes. ""We swore on the Bible to tell the truth and your fellow lied!"" her mother, Rosleigh Rose, booms at the prosecutors. As her daughter is led away, Rose makes a promise: ""Schapelle, you will come home. Our government will bring you home."" Not since Lindy Chamberlain claimed a dingo took her baby in the Outback have Australians become so caught up in a courtroom drama. Nearly nine years on from the verdict, interest remains strong enough to sustain a soon-to-be-broadcast Australian telemovie based on the case. And now Corby has walked out of prison -- on parole but free. Yet Australia remains divided as to whether she is guilty of the crime. To this day, Corby insists she was an unwitting victim of a botched drug smuggling operation. The bust . On 8 October 2004, Corby took a flight with her brother and two friends from Brisbane airport via Sydney to Bali to celebrate Mercedes' 30th birthday. When they landed in Indonesia, customs officials checked their luggage and discovered a plastic bag containing 4.1 kilograms of marijuana -- the largest seizure ever made at Bali's Denpasar airport -- in Corby's boogie board bag. She said she had no idea how the drugs ended up in her luggage. She hadn't locked the bag carrying her board so the marijuana must have been planted there, she argued. Indonesian authorities had a different version of events. Customs officers who were at the airport claimed Corby refused to open the bag when asked -- a claim she denies. They also said she admitted the marijuana was hers. Corby says they had difficulty understanding each other, and that she told them the bag, not the drugs, belonged to her. There was no CCTV footage of the inspection. Corby was arrested and charged with breaching Indonesia's tough anti-drug trafficking laws. She was put in jail without bail pending trial. Her story resonated with many Australians -- those who had been to Bali, a popular tourist destination; those who imagined how easily an unlocked bag could allow drug traffickers to turn a dream holiday into a nightmare; those who held prejudices about customs officials in developing countries; and others who thought, regardless of whether Corby was guilty or not, the penalty she faced was unreasonably harsh. When Corby was sentenced, Australia's then-prime minister John Howard said he understood why Australians felt so strongly about her case. ""The fact that we are a nation whose young travel so much, it is an issue that has touched this country very directly,"" he said. Actor Russell Crowe was an example of a high profile voice on the case. ""When there is such doubt, how can we as a country stand by and let a young lady, as an Australian, rot away in a foreign prison? That is ridiculous,"" he said in an interview with Sydney radio station 2UE. A fair go? Much of the outrage surrounding Corby's case centered on whether she had been treated fairly. Under Indonesian law, Corby had to prove that someone else had placed the drugs in her bag. Indonesian customs officials at the airport did not weigh her luggage. In Australia, Corby's baggage was weighed together with those of her travel companions, not as separate pieces. Corby's defense team asked for fingerprint testing to be carried out on the plastic bag containing the drugs. Their requests were repeatedly denied. Her lawyers claimed that the drugs were planted in Brisbane, by airline baggage handlers involved in interstate drug trafficking, who planned to remove the package in Sydney, but mistakenly sent it to Bali instead. The judges in Corby's trial found her defense team could not prove there was another person responsible for the drugs. As Chief Judge Linton Sirait read out the court's verdict, he said Corby had ""convincingly carried out a crime"" by importing the drugs illegally. ""The actions of the accused were a danger to the community,"" he said. ""This was a transnational crime that could damage the minds of young people."" Is she guilty? As far as many were concerned, Corby was your average young, attractive Aussie. An opinion poll among Australians after she was charged found that more than 90% believed she was innocent. Corby, whose father was a coal miner and mother a fish and chip shop owner, had no previous criminal convictions and no evidence of involvement with drugs in the past. In an interview with Australian public broadcaster ABC, Corby's father, Mick, said she didn't use drugs, except for possibly experimenting in high school. ""Oh, she might have bloody had a puff when she was in bloody Grade 10 or something, round the back of the schoolyard like kids do, I don't know,"" he said. Corby's lawyers relied on a witness -- a prisoner awaiting trial in Melbourne -- who said he overheard other inmates talking about a drug smuggling syndicate that had ""lost"" a package of marijuana after planting it in luggage at Brisbane airport in October 2004. Australian media told the stories of other tourists who said they'd found marijuana in their luggage on arrival in Bali years earlier. One man told Channel Nine, he found a bag of pot about the size of a loaf of bread in his luggage. The man said when he phoned the Australian consulate in Indonesia, they told him ""you get caught with that, mate, and you'll be eating nasi goreng for the rest of your life in jail."" A spokeswoman for the department confirmed that call to a Sydney paper. Then, just weeks before Corby's trial ended, Australian Federal Police and Qantas, the airline Corby used to fly to Bali, announced they had been investigating the role of some baggage handlers in a long running cocaine smuggling operation through Sydney airport. One alleged incident took place on the same day Corby traveled. Corby's defense said they were hopeful of using the evidence in an appeal. However, Qantas said thorough reviews with police found no evidence of links between Corby's case and the alleged cocaine trafficking. Over the years, questions have been raised about Corby's father. A family member accused him of involvement in drug dealing. A book went even further. But Corby's father, who died of cancer in 2008, steadfastly denied any involvement with drugs. For a case under the microscope, no detail -- even involving a family member, is too small. Questions over the integrity of some of Corby's legal team also threatened to damage her case. When allegations emerged that one of Corby's legal advisers requested A$500,000 from the Australian Government in an attempt to bribe Indonesian judges, her flamboyant lawyer, Hotman Paris Hutapea, appeared on an ABC current affairs program ""The 7.30 Report"" to defend himself -- raising other questions in the process. ""So I'm not Mr Clean, but for this case temporarily I am clean,"" he said. ""There is no lawyer in the world is clean (sic) ... If you keep saying Australian lawyer, American lawyer they are all clean, that's totally bulls--t."" What happens now? On Monday, Corby was released on parole amid a swarm of cameras. But she won't be returning to Australia anytime soon. Corby, now 36, must remain in Indonesia on parole until 2017, according to local media reports. It's believed she will live with her sister Mercedes, who has a home in Kuta -- a popular tourist area in Bali. According to CNN's Australian affiliate Seven Network, Corby plans to work in a surf shop owned by Mercedes' husband, where she will design bikinis. It seems the Corby saga isn't over just yet.

"(CNN) -- Rory McIlroy believes he is ""close"" to the form that took him to the top of the world rankings and two major titles and after carding a flawless nine-under 63 to lead the Dubai Desert Classic Thursday few could disagree. Certainly not playing partner and defending champion Stephen Gallacher, who said McIlroy had played ""sublime golf"" to take a two-shot lead after the first round on the Majils course. Gallacher also compiled a fine round of 66 and was not overawed by playing with both McIlroy and current world number one Tiger Woods, who is handily placed after a 68. McIlroy, whose travails in 2013 are well documented, was certainly not getting carried away with his efforts in perfect morning conditions, describing them as ""good"" and my best round ""in a while.""

""I took advantage of how I am driving the ball and just need to do more of the same the next three days,"" he told the official European Tour website. McIlroy finished 2013 with a victory in the Australian Open and has started the new calendar year by claiming second in Abu Dhabi, where his victory hopes were dashed by a two-shot penalty in the opening round. Asked how close he was to peak form, McIlroy added: ""It's close, obviously. This year I've shot a couple of good rounds. This is a little lower than I went in Abu Dhabi and I feel very comfortable with my game."" Last year both he and then new Nike stablemate Woods missed the cut in Abu Dhabi and while the American improved rapidly to claim five PGA Tour titles, McIlroy continued to struggle until the back end of the season, slipping to sixth in the rankings. But with a new management team in place and marriage to tennis star Caroline Wozniacki in the offing, McIlroy has buckled down to a strict practice regime. ""I realize that I've worked really hard in the last couple of months to get to this point and I've realized what I needed to work on, what I need to base my game on and around,"" he said. ""Okay it may feel easy and these scores may look somewhat routine out there, but there's a lot of hard work that goes on behind the scenes to actually be able to go out and shoot scores like this."" Woods missed the cut for the final round at Torrey Pines in his opening tournament of the PGA Tour season last week, but was more satisfied with his efforts in the European Tour event. ""I played all right today. I probably could have got a couple more out of it. I didn't hit a bad putt today which was nice, it was just that sometimes the grain grabbed it pretty hard at the end,"" he said. Gallacher was left in a five-strong chasing group on 66 as the trio were cumulatively 19-under-par. ""Me and Tiger had a couple of holes where we had great saves of par but it was one of those days where we took advantage of the conditions, it was quite benign,"" he said. Sixty eight players from the 132-strong field broke the par of 72, with former major champions Fred Couples and John Daly on two-under 70. Abu Dhabi winner Pablo Larrazabal struggled to a two-over 74, the same mark as 2012 British Open champion Ernie Els and with work to do to make the cut.","Rory McIlroy leads after first round of Dubai Desert Classic .

"London (CNN) -- Two men went on trial Friday accused of the ""cowardly and callous murder"" of British soldier Lee Rigby, who was hacked to death in a London street. Michael Adebolajo, 28, and Michael Adebowale, 22, are each accused of murder, conspiracy to murder a police officer and attempted murder of a police officer. They denied the charges at the Old Bailey court in London. Prosecutor Richard Whittam told the jury that the suspects deliberately attacked an unarmed man from behind using a vehicle as a weapon, ""and then they murdered him and mutilated his body with a meat cleaver and knives."" The court was shown cell phone footage filmed by a witness in which a man who prosecutors said was Adebolajo, holding a bloody cleaver in his hands, spoke into the camera. ""The only reason we've killed this man today is because Muslims are dying daily by British soldiers,"" he said. ""This British soldier is an eye for an eye, a tooth for tooth."" ""You people will never be safe. Remove your governments -- they don't care about you,"" he said, referring also to British Prime Minister David Cameron. ""So get rid of them. Tell them to bring our troops back so you can all live in peace. Leave our lands and you will live in peace."" The killing of Rigby outside the Woolwich Barracks in southeast London on May 22 shocked the nation. He left behind a wife and a young son. Two men plead not guilty to murder of British soldier . Almost decapitated . Describing the events of that day, the prosecutor said the two suspects drove at Rigby in a car traveling at 30 to 40 miles per hour. The soldier appears to have been knocked unconscious by the impact, he said. The court was shown surveillance video of the car crossing to the wrong side of the road before it hit him, and Rigby rolling onto the hood of the car. He was carried on to the sidewalk. Footage from a different surveillance camera showed two men dragging the soldier's limp body from the sidewalk into the middle of the road. Cars driven by passersby stopped at the scene, some with their warning lights flashing. Whittam, the prosecutor, said the defendants were armed with a meat cleaver, knives and a revolver when they got out of the car. ""They both attacked the motionless body of Lee Rigby. He was repeatedly stabbed, and Michael Adebolajo made a serious and almost successful attempt to decapitate him with multiple blows to his neck with the meat cleaver,"" he said. ""Michael Adebowale was using a knife to stab and cut at Lee Rigby's body."" Whittam said the two men dragged the soldier into the road so members of the public could ""see the consequences of their barbarous acts."" At this point, he said, some of the people present showed a ""bravery and decency"" in stark contrast to the suspects' alleged acts. One woman stroked Rigby's body in a gesture of comfort, he said, while another engaged Adebolajo in conversation despite the fact that he was still holding the meat cleaver in his blood-covered hands. Soldier's family to world: Keep calm, don't seek revenge . Conspiracy 'to attack the police' When police arrived at the scene, the two men moved toward their vehicle, Whittam said. Adebolajo carried the cleaver, while Adebowale held the firearm. He aimed it at the officers, although it was not loaded, the prosecutor said. Both men were shot and detained, and the firearms officers gave first aid to keep them alive, he said. The two suspects are accused of waiting for the police to reach the scene, having conspired together to attack an officer. ""It is clear that there was an agreement to attack the police when they arrived,"" Whittam said. Adebolajo got ""very close"" to the driver's side of the police vehicle, he said. While the gun carried by Adebowale was not loaded, he also had on him the bloodstained knife he'd used to attack Rigby, the prosecutor said. The prosecutor also told the court how the firearms officers had to react within moments as they arrived at the scene. One officer ""felt that he was in the most urgent situation of his life,"" he said. The court heard that Adebolajo was shot in the arm by police. Having been given morphine for the pain, he allegedly told paramedics, ""Your government is all wrong. I did it for my God. I wish the bullets had killed me so I can join my friends and family."" Adebowale suffered gunshot injuries to his thumb, abdomen and thigh, the court heard. He was also given pain relief and taken to hospital. Jurors were also shown pictures of the bloodied weapons allegedly used by the two men. Adebolajo had asked to be known as Mujaahid Abu Hamza in court, and Adebowale as Ismail Ibn Abdullah. However, the court has continued to use their given names. The jury was told both men have pleaded guilty to a charge of possession of a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence. Suspects 'bought knives' Whittam said the attack unfolded in a very public place, near a school. Some children, returning from a school outing, had to be turned back by passersby before they saw the gory scene. Friends and relatives of Rigby were in court for the opening of the trial. Some family members left crying as images were shown of the soldier shortly before the attack, as he left the public transit system in Woolwich. The jury also saw CCTV footage of the suspects' movements in the two days before they allegedly launched their attack. They included a visit to a store where Adebolajo bought a five-piece set of kitchen knives and a knife sharpener, the prosecution said. The car allegedly used by the suspects was also caught on surveillance video maneuvering in the vicinity of the street where Rigby was attacked later that day. Security footage from Rigby's last train journey showed he was wearing a ""Help for Heroes"" hooded sweatshirt, in support of a charity that aids military veterans.","Court is shown footage of man with bloody cleaver saying attack is ""an eye for an eye""

"Washington (CNN) -- Claims that workers associated with Animal Planet's ""Call of the Wildman"" show mistreated animals have prompted federal officials to review whether an investigation is warranted. The accusations were made by the magazine Mother Jones, which alleged that ""Call of the Wildman"" staged animal rescues and said it found ""evidence of a culture that tolerated legally and ethically dubious activities."" Those activities include sedating a zebra in violation of federal rules, directing trappers to procure animals so they could be ""caught"" again as part of a script and wrongly completing legal documents. Animal Planet and Sharp Entertainment, the show's production company, have disputed the accusations. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which enforces the Animal Welfare Act, told CNN Thursday it is ""fact-finding"" but has not launched an investigation. The agency said it does not know yet whether Animal Planet or the production company conducted any activities that are regulated under the act. USDA spokeswoman Tanya Espinosa said the Mother Jones article prompted the review. ""Once we have an opportunity to look into the situation, we will work to determine our next steps. If we determine an investigation is warranted, we will open one,"" Espinosa said. On Wednesday, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, an animal rights group, filed a request with the USDA asking it to investigate the allegations. ""Call of the Wildman"" centers on Ernie Brown Jr., also known as ""Turtleman,"" a Kentucky wildlife rescuer who catches ""nuisance"" animals and releases them back into the wild. Animal Planet released a statement to CNN's New Day, saying in part: . ""The life and welfare of all animals is of paramount importance to Animal Planet. It is core to our ethos that every animal's life has value... The notion that there is a culture of 'neglect' at the only network that is devoted to celebrating and protecting animals is absurd. ""Claims in the 'Mother Jones' article were brought to the production company's attention nearly nine months ago. Where appropriate, Sharp Entertainment promptly instituted changes to further ensure the welfare of animals while filming the series."" it read. Dan Adler, senior vice president of Sharp Entertainment, said on New Day Thursday, ""The idea that there is a culture of neglect or abuse on the show is completely false ... Everyone on the show from staff to talent love animals."" ""The idea that animals are killed or drugged on 'Call of the Wildman' is false,"" he said. Adler said nuisance animals in Kentucky are customarily euthanized, but the show has given hundreds of animals ""a second lease on life.""","Magazine Mother Jones accused ""Call of the Wildman"" of mistreating animals .

"(CNN) -- The owner of the dive company on the Indonesian island of Bali helping to search for seven missing divers has said he has ""no clue what happened."" The owner of Yellow Scuba, who gave his name as Putu, spoke to CNN three days after five tourists and two dive instructors, all Japanese women, failed to return to the surface after a dive near the islands of Nusa Lembongan and Nusa Penida, southeast of Bali on Friday. The seven women ranged in age from 27 to 59. ""When the divers plunged into the water, the weather was still good,"" according to local news reports (login required) quoting the ship's captain. ""But about 15 minutes later, it was cloudy. I tried to find them but my efforts produced no results,"" the captain said in a written statement to police. Yellow Scuba said the captain isn't employed by the company, but hired their boat. Yellow Scuba has ""stopped all dives for now,"" Putu said. ""We are still looking,"" said Putu. ""It was their third dive, they went underwater, it was very clear when they were going down. I just get information from the captain, and don't know what happened."" Nyoman Sidakarya, who heads the task force searching for the women, said about 80 people were involved in the search, which will continue until the seventh day after the incident, according to procedure. The search may be extended ""considering the costs and benefits."" The area in which the women were diving is a noted beauty spot, ""but it's also very dangerous,"" said Bali Governor I Made Mangku Pastika, citing ""unpredictable natural aspects."" Heavy rains occurred during the dive that saw the divers go missing, and also on Saturday, hampering rescue efforts. The period from October to April is monsoon season in Bali, which sees strong winds and bursts of heavy rain.

"(CNN) -- Severe weather tore across central Florida on Thursday, causing damage and spawning an apparent tornado in Tampa, the National Weather Service said. A heavy storm with strong winds hit the Sun 'n Fun aviation fair at Lakeland Linder Regional Airport, causing ""extensive minor damage and reports of minor injuries,"" but ""all persons so far have been accounted for,"" said Sgt. Terri Smith of the Lakeland Police Department. The National Weather Service had reported a building collapse that trapped 70 people at the airport, but that report was false, Smith said. The Sun 'n Fun International Fly-In & Expo is a six-day aviation-themed festival that provides the primary source of funding for Sun 'n Fun, a nonprofit organization, and its wholly owned subsidiary, the Florida Air Museum. Greg Lane, a Sun 'n Fun volunteer who is working with a low-power AM radio station at the airport, said the ""sky went from gray to black to bluish green"" as the storm rolled in. ""You couldn't see the tents that were 50 feet across the drive from us,"" he said. The state's emergency management office said it has deployed personnel to the airport and is monitoring the situation, according to spokeswoman Melanie Motiska. In Tampa, meanwhile, an apparent tornado touched down, and parts of Hillsborough County were under a tornado warning that the weather service issued at 11:51 a.m. The warning covered parts of Hillsborough and Polk counties. Tampa Mayor Pam Iorio said there has been some damage to residences and businesses in the city as a result of ""very, very severe weather."" However, she said, there have been no injuries, and ""I think we're faring well."" She said trees, including huge oaks, have been upended and power lines have been downed. The fire department has been at the scene of every structural damage incident, Iorio said. She added that there might be more severe damage outside the city. Iorio added that since Wednesday, media reports had warned residents that ""today's the day to stay inside"" because of bad weather. ""It's going to be a big system for the rest of the day,"" said CNN meteorologist Chad Myers, referring to the low-pressure system and cold front that developed over the Gulf of Mexico and moved east across Florida. ""You need to get inside your home and away from the glass."" The storm damaged about 25 homes in Hillsborough County, Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Debbie Carter said. Severe thunderstorm and tornado warnings have been issued across north and central Florida and will remain in effect until 8 p.m. ET, emergency spokeswoman Motiska said. Additional strong to severe thunderstorms with damaging winds, hail, heavy rain, lightning and isolated tornadoes are also possible through the evening. A photo on the website of Bay News 9 showed an overturned small airplane at the St. Petersburg/Clearwater airport. The affiliate also broadcast images of damaged street signs and billboards as high winds swept through the area.

"(CNN) -- In the ice skating community, Cheryl Davis and Jacqui White are known as ""the moms"" because they have been nearly inseparable for 16 years. That's when their children, Meryl Davis and Charlie White, started skating together as ice dancers. The skating duo, Olympic silver medalists in Vancouver in 2010 and world champions in 2013, were favorites to bring home the gold medal in the Winter Games in Sochi, Russia -- and they delivered. After placing first with a world-record 78.89 score in the short dance, Davis and White earned a world-record 116.63 in the free program on Monday, bringing home the first-ever gold medal for the United States in the ice dancing competition. Their moms, who fly to and from every competition together, planned to be seated side by side at the Olympics: Davis always on the right, White on her left. ""Even in an interview now, Jacqui will say, 'Wait a minute, she's on the wrong side,' "" said Davis, a mother of two from West Bloomfield, Michigan. It's just one of the many rituals these Olympic moms follow as they gear up for what they hoped would be a history-making competition for their children. 'Lucky Uggs' White always wears a pair of ""lucky Uggs,"" and she doesn't change her jewelry, a habit that dates to her years as a hockey mom. (Charlie played 13 years of travel hockey and was part of a state championship winning team.) ""The hockey moms used to see me come in. If I was wearing a different pair of earrings, they'd look at me (and say), 'Hey, you weren't wearing those earrings the last time we won, and it's the first time they scored on us. You are taking them off,' "" said White, a mother of five, also from Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. ""So I am now superstitious ... and I can't get over it,"" she said, chuckling. Davis has her own rituals, including writing down every skater's scores. ""I always take my pad with me, and I always write down every score, and then if I miss one, I'm like, 'Oh, darn ...' but it doesn't matter,"" Davis said with a laugh. The task is pointless, she admitted, since she never looks at the scores again. ""It just keeps us thinking about something else,"" she said. ""It gives us a little distraction."" 'Not sure what we gave up' Davis and White are just two of the thousands of Olympic moms around the country and the world who devoted hours, energy and money -- and a good chunk of their own lives -- to make their children's Olympic dreams come true. But don't mention the ""S word"" to them: sacrifice. They don't believe they've sacrificed to get here. ""I know that people want to call it a sacrifice, and it is in some ways, because you do put a lot of your time and a lot of your money into it. But on the other hand, a sacrifice almost means you are almost giving up a lot,"" Davis said. ""I am not sure what we gave up."" The early years were harder, Davis and White admit, especially as both kids trained for singles' competitions in addition to working together on ice dancing. Meryl, who just turned 27, started skating at age 5. Charlie, 26, began when he was 3. ""We were there every single day. We would drive them, pick them up from school, drive them to the rink, stay with them ... rush over while they were on the ice and get them a bagel with cream cheese or chocolate milk or whatever they wanted,"" White said. ""It's long enough ago so that it gets kind of blurred into the rest of the years, but early on, it was a lot of time. It was a lot more dedication and work for us, but it was work we really enjoyed and really loved, so it doesn't fall in the 'sacrifice' label."" 'Each one is special' An additional challenge for any Olympic family is making sure the other siblings don't feel shadowed by a 24/7 commitment to a sport. Championship figure skating includes four or five hours on the ice every day, dance lessons, physical fitness training, travel to competitions, research for costumes, appearances and interviews. Amy Hughes of Great Neck, New York, is a mom of six whose daughter Sarah won the Olympic gold in figure skating in 2002 and whose daughter Emily competed in the 2006 Games. ""I think because there were six of them, it was much healthier,"" Amy Hughes said. ""People would come in, (and) they said, 'You don't have all of Sarah and Emily's stuff up; you have everybody's.' ""I said, 'Well, each one is special.'"" Hughes recently asked Emily what she did as a mom to raise an Olympian, ""She says, 'Oh, Ma, you got us everywhere we had to go, and then you'd forget to pick us up.' And I laughed, and I said, 'You know, you're right.' "" 'Charlie's my boat' Raising an Olympian, especially in figure skating with the cost of ice time, lessons, choreography, costumes and travel, can take a financial toll on a family. Hughes, White and Davis say they're thankful that wasn't their experience. ""I have to ask (my husband), how did we do it? I can't answer that, because I don't know. I just know we kept going and going,"" said Hughes, whose husband is a real estate tax attorney. ""It wasn't like some skating families (who) have to remortgage their house. We didn't have to do that,"" said Davis, a former teacher. ""When you look at what other people sacrifice -- and people we know, personally, are some of those people -- it breaks my heart that they've put so much into it and not all kids are lucky enough to get where our kids are."" White jokes that she doesn't know how much she's spent on more than 20 years of ice skating because she tries ""not to look."" ""We try not to add it up, because I'm sure if we added it up, then we would start to feel like, 'Oh, my God, we've made such a sacrifice,' "" White said. ""I always tell Meryl she's my cottage,"" said Davis, joking that money spent on skating could have bought the family a second home. ""And Charlie's my boat,"" White added. 'Thank you, Mom' Both Davis and White are part of Procter & Gamble's ""Thank You, Mom,"" program, which highlights the awe-inspiring contributions of Olympic moms. The program includes providing a ""family home"" in Sochi, where U.S. athletes and their families can get free meals and beauty services, as well as help for U.S. families to pay the travel costs to Russia. Each Olympic Games, the company creates an ad that seems to make just about every mom -- this one included -- need to grab the tissues. In the current ad, moms are seen picking up their toddlers after falls on the ice and in the snow and bucking them up when things were not going their way. ""When I watch that commercial, it really grabs my heart,"" White said. ""I think you sit there and you wonder, how many times can you fall and get back up again? Your first instinct is to go out there and say 'Stop hurting yourself; let me take you home to something fun,' but you don't, because the more loving thing is to let them go, let them pick themselves up sometimes and let them continue on and get stronger because of it."" 'You can't help but cry' How much joy did ""the moms"" expect to feel when they watched Meryl and Charlie compete for Olympic gold in Sochi? ""Every time we talk about the joy of it and how much we love it, that's when we start to cry,"" Davis said. ""You are so bursting with pride (about) who they are and what they've accomplished that you always start to cry. You can't help but cry."" White says she's sometimes wondered, does skating create the person that is so awesome, or does the awesomeness of the person create the skater? ""Because I look at Meryl and Charlie, they're such an awesome couple as people, and I just wonder, has the discipline and everything that is involved in their skating career helped to shape that personality? ""We feel proud of the people they are. I feel that that's what we are most proud of,"" White said. Hughes planned to watch Meryl and Charlie, and all the other skaters, from her living room in New York. She knows exactly what it feels like to watch not one, but two children compete for Olympic gold. ""Indescribable,"" she said with a laugh. ""We didn't expect any of this. I just feel like it's all this tremendous gift ... and the whole family was thrilled. We were all there for everybody."" What do you think it takes to raise an Olympian?
