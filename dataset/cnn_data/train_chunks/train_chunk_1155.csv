"Liverpool's poor start to the season is down to 'a dark cloud hanging over Anfield'  according to former Reds star John Toshack. Brendan Rodgers side lost 1-0 to Real Madrid in the Champions League on Tuesday night and have now won just six of their 16 games in all competitions. Toshack, who played for the Merseyside club for eight years, believes his old side are struggling for form because they have not yet recovered from narrowly missing out on the Premier League title last term.

Reds boss Brendan Rodgers (centre) has won just six of 16 games in all competitions this season . Ex-Liverpool star John Toshack believes the Reds are still suffering from missing out on the title last season . Rodgers' men lost 2-0 at home to Chelsea on April 27 before throwing away a three-goal lead at Crystal Palace to draw 3-3 with the Eagles just over a week later. Those results allowed Manchester City to swoop in and land their second title in three years on the final day of the season, something Toshack feels the Reds have not yet forgotten. Speaking to BBC Radio 4 on Wednesday, Toshack said: 'I still think there is a hangover there from what happened at Crystal Palace last season, a bitter pill to swallow.

'They went so close after being so long without winning that championship. I still think they are feeling the effects of that I think.'

"Police prevented a pregnant woman in labor from crossing the street to get to a nearby hospital yesterday in L.A. because President Barack Obama's motorcade was on the way. A Twitter user documented the unidentified woman sitting on a bus bench for roughly half an hour, waiting for the president and his entourage to pass through, as she was attended to by another woman in scrubs.

Kovacik talked to a police officer who told him that the LAPD would allow the woman to go to the hospital 'as soon as we can.' 'It looks like the motorcade is coming through . right about now, so we’ll be able to open it up for traffic,' he said. 'The first . thing we’ll try to get through will be an ambulance.'

"David Cameron has insisted that new powers for HMRC allowing them to seize money from people's bank accounts is necessary if people want to avoid tax rises . Taxes will have to rise unless HM Revenue and Customs is given new powers to raid bank accounts, David Cameron insisted yesterday. Amid controversy over whether the taxman should be allowed to take money to settle debts without permission, the Prime Minister suggested one of the alternatives was to ‘raise tax rates’. In a TV interview he said: ‘We have a choice here. ‘If we don’t collect taxes properly and [don’t] make sure people pay their taxes properly we look at the problems of having to raise tax rates. ‘I don’t want to do that, so I  support the changes the Chancellor set out in the Budget which is to really say that not paying your taxes is not acceptable. ‘It is very clear that they can only do this if there is a debt of over £1,000, they can only do it if there’s £5,000 or more in the account after this has been completed. ‘The principle is do we want to pursue every avenue of making people pay the taxes they are meant to pay before we put up taxes – because that’s the alternative – absolutely, yes we do.’ Joint accounts could also be targeted – even if one of the account holders is not being chased by the taxman. HM Revenue and Customs insists it will not take money from anyone with less than £5,000 in their bank account in order to stop people being left cash-strapped. But accountants say that means revenue dodgers would simply avoid being targeted by moving their money out of their bank accounts. MPs have already warned that the power granted to HMRC to remove cash from bank accounts without court orders is ‘very concerning’. They believe taxpayers could suffer ‘serious detriment’ if officials take money from people who have done no wrong. A string of critics say the proposals, which were contained in the fine print of the March Budget, could also end up  punishing the innocent. Eamonn Butler, director of the Adam Smith Institute think-tank, said: ‘Plans to allow HM Revenue and Customs to take money directly from the accounts of tax delinquents are a fundamental assault on the rule of law. Under new proposals, the taxman would be allowed to take cash from anyone who owed more than £1,000, as long as it left at least £5,000 in their account afterwards . 'Next year is the 800th anniversary of Magna Carta, but the basic civil  protections it gave citizens against arbitrary power are being systematically eroded.’ Emma Carr, from Big Brother Watch, said: ‘These plans represent nothing less than HMRC wanting to act as judge, jury and executioner. ‘These powers would increase the risk of HMRC wrongly collecting money from taxpayers, a warning that the Government and Treasury would be reckless to ignore.’ Confidence in the tax authorities has been eroded by a series of errors, including sending incorrect tax codes to  millions of pensioners over a number of years. Alex Henderson, tax partner at accountants PwC, said the ‘potential consequences have not been thought through’. ‘This could lead to the situation where struggling businesses are pushed under,’ he said. ‘Imagine if it then turned out HMRC had made a  mistake. You might get your tax back but that doesn’t help you if you’ve lost your job.’ Patrick Stevens, tax policy director at the Chartered Institute for Taxation, said: ‘The type of people we’re after, who are smart and have decided to give HMRC the runaround, will make sure there isn’t enough money in their account for HMRC to go after.’ He added: ‘Allowing HMRC a free run at bank accounts will end up with some very unhappy little old ladies.’","David Cameron has insisted that new powers for HMRC are necessary .
Without them, PM warns, government may be forced to raise taxes .

"One of the major financial backers of President Barrack Obama's 2012 re-election campaign has been indicted in an alleged multi-million dollar insurance swindle. Kareem Ahmed, the president and CEO of Ontario firm Landmark Medical Management, is accused of masterminding the scheme and is facing charged of conspiracy, insurance fraud and involuntary manslaughter, according to TPM. Ahmed and 15 of his associates - most of them doctors and one pharmacist - were indicted by a California grand jury, TPM reported. He is accused of developing topical cream formulas 'based on the profitability of the ingredients' and bribing doctors who treated workers' compensation patients to prescribe them. Kareem Ahmed was one of the largest individual financial backers of President Obama's 2012 re-election effort. He is pictured here with first lady Michelle Obama . Kareem Ahmed, who gave $1 million to the Obama re-election campaign in 2012, has been indicted by Orange Country grand jury for leading a major insurance kickback scheme through his company, Landmark Medical Management . Ahmed paid physicians a total of more than $25 million to dispense the compound creams, according to KPCC. The alleged operation is said to have gone on from June 15, 2010, to December 31, 2012. It also involved filing false insurance claims with different insurance companies. The amounts individual doctors received between 2010 and 2013 ranged from $600,000 to more than $2.5 million . Among those Ahmed paid were Daniel Capen, M.D. (more than $2.5 million); Andrew Jarminski, M.D. (more than $1.9 million); pharmacist Michael Rudolph (more than $1 million); and Rahil Kahn, M.D. (more than $1 million), according to the indictment. However mystery surrounds the circumstances of the involuntary manslaughter charge. The incident alleged that on or about Feb. 3, 2012, Ahmed, Rudolph and Jarminski 'did unlawfully and without malice kill Andrew G. (a minor) ... in the commission of a lawful act which might produce death, in an unlawful manner and without due caution and circumspection'. The indictment had no other details. Ahmed has denied the charges through a spokesperson. Kareem Ahmed is pictured here with Simin Hasemizadeh, CEO of the Simin Hope Foundation, at an event in Santa Monica in June 2012. Ahmed is accused of bribing doctors and a pharmacist into prescribing creams his medical firm created . The human resources for his company, Landmark Medical Management, Ladonna Hieber said in a statement to TPM that Ahmed and his staff 'are innocent of all charges that have been alleged'. 'The charges are meritless and we expect full exoneration of any wrongdoing,' Hieber said in the statement. Ahmed gave $1 million to the pro-Obama super PAC Priorities USA Action in 2012. Additionally, data maintained by The Center for . Responsive Politics showed that Ahmed gave tens of thousands of additional . dollars to Democrats in 2013. The practices of his medical firm have been under suspicion for years in California. In a 2012 interview with TPM, Ahmed said he was trying to protect his business by remaining private. 'My problem is, I don't want competition,' he said at the time. 'I like to have a private life. I don't want people to copy my business model, which I have wasted millions on, with legal opinion letters, from whatever, perfecting it over years. 'I don't want people to take it for free, and start giving me competition.' In early October, the Orange County District Attorney's Office raided the offices of Landmark Medical Management.","Kareem Ahmed is the CEO of Landmark Medical Management in Ontario, California .

"Manchester United's win against Crystal Palace on Saturday was only their third by a 1-0 scoreline in the 49 Premier League games played since Sir Alex Ferguson retired. It's a result more readily associated with George Graham's Arsenal than the all-singing cast at Old Trafford but Louis van Gaal won't care with a top-four finish his over-riding priority this season. In fact, the way Van Gaal set up his team for a home game against struggling Palace encouraged a tight match in which United could maintain a possession stranglehold of the game and eventually prevail. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Juan Mata shoots and scores to give Manchester United a 1-0 win against Crystal Palace at Old Trafford . Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie congratulate Mata as United won 1-0 for the third time in 49 matches . United boss Louis van Gaal, pictured with Albert Stuivenberg and Ryan Giggs, set up to maintain possession . The  1-0 scoreline is synonymous with George Graham's Arsenal side of the late eighties and early nineties . Having spent £158million over the summer, van Gaal had become worried by United's soft underbelly, and the ease in which his team had conceded five at Leicester City, four at MK Dons and failed to beat Chelsea or Manchester City in their last two games. This is how the United manager stopped playing fantasy football – and delivered a win. 1: THE RETURN OF MICHAEL CARRICK . Having suffered ankle ligament damage in Van Gaal's first week in the job, this was a first start of the season for the England man. He was asked to sit in front of the back four, give United controlled possession of the ball and be alert to any Palace counter-attacks. It didn't make for gung-ho excitement but United finished the game with 72 per cent possession and Juan Mata took the one chance that counted. Michael Carrick, starting his first game of the season, challenges Crystal Palace striker Marouane Chamakh . 2: WAYNE ROONEY, MIDFIELDER . On paper, the United formation looked as if it would pan out as a 4-4-2 with Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney up front. In reality it was 4-1-4-1 with Carrick sitting and Rooney playing alongside Marouane Fellaini in central midfield. For a home game against Crystal Palace, David Moyes would undoubtedly have been criticised for negativity if he'd used a similar system. But with United having started the weekend a lowly 10th, Van Gaal simply decided on a zero-risk policy, particularly with four centre halves unavailable through injury and suspension. Rooney wasn't a stand-out performer but he was disciplined, kept the ball moving and did venture forward at the right times, firing two shots wide. Rooney, playing in central midfield, gave a disciplined performance and kept the ball moving against Palace . 3: NO MORE FAMOUS FIVE . The hype had us believe that Van Persie-Rooney-Mata-Falcao-Di Maria were going to be United's answer to Tottenham's attacking quintet of Klinsmann-Sheringham-Dumitrescu-Barmby-Anderton. Their attitude was that no matter how many the opposition would score, they would score more. Van Gaal has clearly decided such a line-up and approach is unworkable in reality. Only Van Persie and Rooney stayed on the pitch for 90 minutes on Saturday, and Rooney spent it in midfield rather than attack. Mata started on the bench and soon after he came on, Di Maria made way to keep the balance right and help preserve United's slender lead. Falcao hasn't played for a couple of weeks because of a training ground injury that hasn't been fully explained, and even when he returns there is no guarantee he'll be ahead of teenager James Wilson in the pecking order. Striker Van Persie played 90 minutes  but Van Gaal has since decided against playing all his star men together . 4: DI MARIA SACRIFICED FOR THE TEAM . Soon after he'd completed his record £60million move to United, Di Maria was the star of the show for Argentina against Germany in a rematch of the World Cup final, his heat map showing he appeared all over the field to score and set up goals. But his thrilling brand of football is also risky when attacking moves break down and United had been wounded in previous games, the problem compounded by having to make so many changes in defence. So on Saturday, Van Gaal asked Di Maria to stay wide on the left and not to desert his post; no wandering, no dragging the team out of position. For the Argentine, it was difficult; Palace defended so deep and often doubled up on him, so there was no space. He was replaced with 20 minutes to go, soon after supplying the assist for Mata's strike. Van Gaal was sympathetic and his estimation of Di Maria has probably gone up after his selfless efforts. Not every superstar sacrifices his skills for the team cause at a cost to their own performance. Angel di Maria had a difficult afternoon after the Argentine was forced to sacrifice his skills and stay on the left . 5: BALANCE AT THE BACK . Ironically, Van Gaal's predecessor Moyes was a huge fan of having one right-footed centre back play alongside one left-footed centre back. At Everton, he insisted on it as an unbreakable rule – no matter which individuals might be left out as a result. Van Gaal took a leaf out of Moyes' book and brought in midfielder Daley Blind to replace the injured Marcos Rojo, mainly because he is a natural left-footer. Teenager Paddy McNair and Blind therefore had the right-left combination at the heart of United's defence and though they gave up one chance to Fraizer Campbell by leaving a cross to each other, their overall partnership was good given their clear inexperience of the Premier League – just nine previous starts between them.","Manchester United beat Crystal Palace 1-0 at Old Trafford on Saturday .

"A semi-professional rugby player punched his model girlfriend in the face after she caught him flirting on Facebook, a court heard. Swansea RFC hooker Paul John, 26, is accused of leaving his partner Amy John scarred for life after he 'hit her in the face' during the row at his parents' home in Porthcawl, South Wales. The captain of the Welsh club denied a charge of unlawful wounding when he appeared on trial at Cardiff Crown Court yesterday. Amy John, a model, found flirty messages on her boyfriend Paul John's Facebook, the jury heard. He is accused of 'punching her in the face' during a row at his parents' house in Porthcawl, South Wales . The jury heard how the pair, who are not married and coincidentally share a surname, started arguing after a night spent drinking and socialising. John (left) allegedly attacked his partner (right) in a row over Facebook . The jury heard how the pair, who are not married and coincidentally share a surname, started arguing after a night spent drinking and socialising with friends. They had returned to the house in Porthcawl when Miss John, a pathology graduate, found flirty messages on her boyfriend's Facebook account, the jury heard. She had checked his account while he was in the bathroom getting ready for bed. She told the jury: 'When I found he'd been chatting to other girls - and there were quite a few messages - I was really upset and just wanted to leave. 'But he said I wasn't leaving and hit me with his fist. 'I was genuinely shocked, I thought he was a nice boy and that's why I chose to be with him. 'I turned to the mirror behind me and there was blood dripping out of my lip.' After the row Miss John, a model, was taken  to Princess of Wales Hospital, Bridgend, where she had stitches . The pathology graduate told the jury at Cardiff Crown Court: 'I will have the scar for the rest of my life' Miss John was taken by her father to Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend where she received stitches for her injury. She was later transferred on to Morriston Hospital in Swansea to see a plastic surgeon. She told the court: 'I will have the scar for the rest of my life. I can cover it with make-up but that doesn't mean it is not there.' Swansea RFC's Paul John, 26, (pictured outside Cardiff Crown Court) denies unlawful wounding . John, of Porthcawl, denies a charge of unlawful wounding, and when interviewed police, he told them: 'I would never punch her.' Following the alleged incident, he told officers that Miss John had kicked him twice in the groin as he tried to stop her leaving his parents' home, and he had caught her accidentally in the face. However, Miss John told the court she believed it had been deliberate and denied making contact with John. She said: 'There was no shouting because his parents were asleep but I went down to the porch where we had taken off our shoes and tried to put mine on to go. 'But he said I wasn't leaving, wouldn't give me my keys, and was pulling at my shoes and legs and making me feel trapped. 'The front door was locked. 'He was crouching in front of me and I kicked out, aiming for his groin, but I know I didn't make contact because he stared at me, stood up, leaned over, glared and hit me with his fist.' During the hearing, defence counsel Elwen Evans QC told her: 'You kicked him in his private parts and all he did was push you away.' However, she responded: 'Pushing me away would not have caused me to need surgery.' She accepted in answer to Ms Evans that she was using the experience in her application to study for a doctorate, having already completed her master's degree. 'There are consequences to actions,' she said. 'If I punched someone I would have to face up to it. 'He is dragging me through this [the court] by pleading not guilty.' Ms John, a volunteer with the NHS and the police, said she had decided not to call the police at first but later changed her mind. 'He told me on Facebook that he would lose his job and I felt under pressure,' she said. 'I felt like I was the one in the wrong.' John denies a charge of unlawful wounding. The trial continues.

"They say less is more, and that is certainly true for this petrifying two-minute horror movie. The simple story titled Lights Out starts with a girl turning off her light to go to bed - sparking a terrifying stand-off with a demon. The 120 seconds of classic horror techniques that ensue will leave you never wanting to turn your light off again. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Mystery: The two-minute movie starts with the girl turning off her hallway light to see a mysterious silhouette . Petrified: She grows increasingly tense, turning the light on and off, but seemingly nobody is there . Directed by award-winning short film maker David F Sandberg, the dialogue-free short caused a flurry when it came out last year. Having resurfaced, it is stirring viewers all over again. It starts with a girl, played by actress Lotta Losten, in a pyjama top flicking off the light in her hallway. With seemingly nobody else in the flat, she freezes at the sight of a silhouette. The horror movie by award-winning director David F Sandberg has once again caused a flurry on Twitter . Despite having no dialogue, it is packed full of classic horror techniques as the girl tussles with her fears . Still scared, she tapes the light switch to keep it on, which many viewers may well be tempted to do now . She turns the light back on, and the silhouette disappears. As she continues flicking back and forth, the music intensifies, until she duct tapes the switch to keep it on. An extreme step? Apparently not, for as she lies in bed, the light goes once more. Once in bed, she feels no safer, staring at her half-open door as the light flickers then goes out . Then, it is the bedside lamp that starts going. Burying her head under the covers, she fumbles for the plug . Using just two rooms, two lights, and one actress, Sandberg has terrified viewers . It is a classic build-up to an ending that has sent Twitter users into some sort of frenzy. One user shared the video, exclaiming: 'OMG this is Freaky as hell!!!' Another said: 'I love being scared but I have to admit I watched most of this through my fingers!'

"Train passengers in France greeted their afternoon TGV service with horror yesterday when it pulled in to the station with the body of a dead cyclist crushed onto its front. Drivers of the Paris to Mulhouse high-speed locomotive initially failed to notice the accident in the village of Petit-Croix, near Belfort, in eastern France, on Sunday. Shockingly, the unidentified 48-year-old victim was therefore carried for 25 miles across the French countryside on the nose of the service before it was spotted at the end of the line. It meant that passengers waiting at Mulhouse saw the grisly remains as the train pulled in, with many expressing horror and anguish. Grisly: Drivers of the Paris to Mulhouse service initially failed to notice the accident in the village of Petit-Croix, near Belfort, in eastern France, on Sunday afternoon (stock image) 'It was an upsetting sight,' said a spokesman for SNCF, France's national railway. 'The body was stuck on to the front of the train, but out of the vision of those in the driver's car.' The spokesman made it clear that such incidents were 'relatively rare' and said that a criminal enquiry had been launched. Passengers and rail staff were receiving counselling for emotional trauma. The dead man has not been publicly named, but was 48, and has been identified thanks to personal property discovered around his bike. Horror: It meant that passengers waiting at Mulhouse (pictured) saw the grisly remains as the train pulled in, with many expressing horror and anguish . 'Gendarmes found the bicycle at Petit-Croix,' said a local police spokesman. 'The remains are being examined for clues as to exactly what happened.' The macabre incident would have been picked up by CCTV footage, both at the crossing and at other points along the line.

"Angry: Alana Willetts with her son George, nine, who has been banned from using Black Country dialect at school . Children at a primary school in the West Midlands have been told to speak proper English instead of the Black Country dialect to halt a ‘decline in standards’. Those who say they ‘cor do that’ – ‘can’t do that’ – will not be punished, but they will be corrected every time they utter an outlawed phrase. Angry parents criticised the ban at Colley Lane Primary School in Halesowen, claiming it is ‘snobbish’ and ‘insulting’. A letter posted to parents last week said the school wanted pupils to have the ‘best start possible’. It added: ‘Recently we asked each class teacher to write a list of the top ten most damaging phrases used by children in the classroom. We are introducing a “zero tolerance” in the classroom to get children out of the habit of using the phrases on the list.’ The Black Country includes Dudley, Sandwell, Walsall, and southern parts of Wolverhampton. Other words and phrases on the prohibited list include ‘ay’, meaning ‘pardon’, and ‘I day’, meaning ‘I didn’t’. Alana Willetts, 30, whose nine-year-old son George goes to the school, said staff should be teaching pupils about the Black Country and its dialect. ‘Some of my friends have gone on to be doctors and lawyers and I’m an engineer – [the accent] doesn’t affect you as a person,’ she said. ‘I think it is patronising and insulting to say that people with a Black Country accent are disadvantaged. All the parents are outraged.’ Ann Mills, 62, who has two grandchildren at the school, added: ‘I was raised here and I’m proud of the way we speak.’ Colley Lane Primary School, in Halesowen, West Midlands, where staff have have drawn up a list of offending Black Country phrases that have been banned in the classroom . Here are the phrases pupils at Colley Lane Primary School, in Halesowen, have been banned from using: . 1. 'They was' instead of 'they were.' 2. 'I cor do that' instead of 'I can't do that.' 3. 'Ya' instead of 'you.' 4. 'Gonna' instead of 'going to.' 5. 'Woz' instead of 'was.' 6. 'I day' instead of 'I didn't.' 7. 'I ain't' instead of 'I haven't.' 8. 'Somefink' instead of 'something.' 9. 'It wor me' instead of 'it wasn't me.' 10. 'Ay?' instead of 'pardon?' But Zheyan Kareem, 31, who moved to . the UK eight years ago and whose seven-year-old son is a pupil, . supported the ban, saying:  ‘English is my second language. So for . me … it is good if my child speaks English in the house and not slang . picked up at school.’ The . primary school, which has 592 children aged four to 11 and was judged . ‘good’ at its last Ofsted inspection, defended the move. Headteacher . John White said: ‘We value the dialect but we want to encourage children . to learn when to use it and when not, like for a job interview.’ The Black . Country includes the three Metropolitan Boroughs of Dudley, Sandwell and . Walsall and the southern parts of the city of Wolverhampton, but does . not include Birmingham. Headteacher John White said: 'I think we are seeing a decline in standards of English when children come into school. 'We are seeing that some children coming in are not able to speak very much at all to be honest. 'I . think some of the changes in society - the amount of time people sit . around and talk together and the amount of screen time - seem to be . having an effect on how confidently children speak when starting school. 'We . want to pick them up on that and improve their standards in English. It . is important because it is the foundation of everything. The letter staff at Colley Lane Primary School, in Halesowen, West Midlands, sent out to parents . 'If they can't say it, it is likely they can't read it, and even less likely they can write it. 'We value the dialect but we want to encourage children to learn when to use and when not, like for a job interview. It is, of course, fine to use in other situations and we would celebrate that. 'We know it is a topic lots of people will be interested in, but I'm positive about it. If it starts to get people talking about the issue, that can only be a good thing. 'We will correct children if they get the words wrong.' The school was rated as either Good or Outstanding in a Ofsted inspection report in 2010. The distinctive Black Country dialect of the 'Yam Yams' is spoken in towns like Wolverhampton, Sandwell, Tipton and Dudley, and can be very confusing to outsiders. Scholars find it fascinating because it has preserved grammar from Early Modern English and even Middle English. 'Thee', 'Thy' and 'Thou' are still in use, as is the case in parts of Yorkshire and Lancashire. 'Ow B'ist', meaning 'How beist thou?' is a common greeting, with the typical answer being 'Bay too bah', meaning 'I bayn't be too bad'. 'I haven't seen her' becomes 'I ay sid 'er'. Black Country dialect often substitutes the word 'ar' for 'yes'. Several word pronunciations are also different: 'you' is pronounced 'yow' (pronounced yo  with a silent w), whereas 'go', which is often pronounced 'goo' or 'gooin'' for 'going', is more in line with pronunciations in the Midlands. It is also quite common for broad Black Country speakers to say 'agooin' instead of 'going'. Inhabitants are proud to be known as Black Country 'folk' and resist hints at any relationship to people living in Birmingham, calling Birmingham 'Brum-a-jum' (Birmingham's colloquial name is 'Brummagem', a corruption of its older name of 'Bromwicham' and hence West Bromwich) or 'Birminam' (missing the g and h out and saying it the way it's spelt). Residents of Birmingham ('Brummies') meanwhile often refer to their Black Country neighbours as 'Yam Yams', a reference to the use of 'Yow am' (or yow'm ) instead of 'You are', and not because they say 'I yam' instead of 'I am'. Dudley residents often refer to the people of Birmingham as 'Dummy Brummies'. Also, the town of Walsall can be pronounced either 'War-sall' or 'Wor-sull', with a strong Walsall accent considered to be typical 'yam-yam'. The strong Black Country dialect is less commonly heard today than in the past. However, a stronger variation of the dialect (than the one frequently used) appears to be heard quite often in conversations between older Black Country folk. The word endings with 'en' are still noticeable in conversation as in 'gooen' (going), 'callen' (calling) and the vowel 'A' is pronounced as 'O' as in 'sond' (sand), 'hond' (hand) and 'mon' (man). Other pronunciations are 'winder' for window, 'fer' for 'far', and 'loff' for 'laugh' exactly as Chaucer's English was spoken. Local dialect was (and probably still is to a lesser degree) quite distinctive between the different towns and villages of the Black Country. Although most outsiders to the Black Country can't tell this difference, Black Country folk can quiet fiercely defend the difference between the accent. Here is a glossary of Black Country vocabulary: . Aive - Lift, heaveBawk - ConfuseBeesum - A pert young womanBibble - Pebble, stoneBlithyed - A foolBowler - A large mothBoffle - To hinderBonk - A small hillBroo'us - A breweryCagmag - A gossipy old womanCaw - CannotChicklings - Pig's intestines (a Black Country delicacy)Codding - JokingFizog - FaceFlen - A fleaJed - DeadKench - Back strainMiskin - An outside toiletCarradiddle - A lie, fibTranklements - Miscellaneous items, paraphernaliaWerit - Worry .","Staff at the West Midlands primary have drawn up list offending phrases .

"THE UTOPIA EXPERIMENT . by Dylan Evans . (Picador £14.99) How many thousands of books and films are there containing stories about visionaries who set up utopian societies — with untoward consequences? This book addresses the same subject, but it is not fiction. Dylan Evans tried it for himself, and it drove him mad. Less than ten years ago, Evans was a professional scientist, conducting research into robotics and artificial intelligence. But during a holiday to Mexico in 2005, he perceived striking parallels between the collapse of the Mayan empire 1,000 or so years ago and the state of civilisation today. Could our certainties founder in the way theirs did? Dylan Evans returned from his trip to Mexico with the determination to create a community that could exist without technology and the home comforts we take for granted (picture posed by models) As he describes, many societies collapsed in the past ‘because their energy requirements began to outstrip their energy resources’. But what if a community could rise from the rubble and exist without technology and the home comforts we take for granted? He returned, determined to create such a community as an experiment, simulating what life after an apocalypse might be like. He built it in the Scottish Highlands, mainly from sticks and canvas, and called it Utopia. Alarmingly, but intriguingly, his book starts with a 3am scream in a psychiatric hospital. The scream isn’t his, and it’s at the end of the experiment, not the beginning, when — for his own safety — he has been detained under the Mental Health Act. He recounts how Utopia tested, and finally broke, his sanity. It is a fascinating, troubling and, at times, hilarious tale. The inescapable truth is that Evans wasn’t entirely stable to start with. He became a committed ‘doomer’ — someone who thinks the end of the world, if not exactly nigh, is approaching. He began to envisage his self-sufficient, post-apocalyptic community, not just as an exercise in social observation, not as The Good Life writ large, but as a kind of dress rehearsal for the real thing. Inevitably, once news of the project spread, it attracted a motley collection of fellow-utopians: from engaging idealists to raging crackpots, with a few blissed-out hippies in between. But he didn’t blunder into the experiment unprepared. Evans checked out other ‘eco-villages’ and ‘alternative communities’, including one near where I live in Herefordshire. Indeed, parts of this book reminded me of my own family’s move to the sticks some years ago. Like Evans, I had a romantic notion of becoming ‘a horny-handed son of toil’, only to be completely at a loss the first time I had to wring an ailing chicken’s neck. For Evans, the killing of a pig called Fatso proved similarly traumatic. Very quickly, he also found the utopian ideology was about as watertight as one of his leaky yurts, and the egalitarianism lasted about as long as it took for one volunteer to be more forceful than another. Evans does note, perceptively, that ‘utopias also attract misfits, whose inability to integrate may not be due to the society they blame, but to their own cantankerous personalities’. Adam, given to ululating late at night, was a prime example. Moreover, the society on which they were all trying not to rely had a nasty habit of encroaching on their commune. Terrified that one of his volunteers might get hurt, or worse, Evans took out third-party liability insurance. Which, he concedes, ‘felt like cheating, like I wasn’t fully embracing the radical uncertainty of primitive living’. And though they resourcefully made their own toothpaste by mixing baking powder, sea salt and peppermint, they had no idea how to make the baking powder, so bought it from a local supermarket. Not very hunter-gatherer. Evans’ relentless self-questioning about these small, but forgivable, transgressions against the spirit of his own experiment did nothing for his mental health, which further deteriorated as he realised he had invested so much thought and energy into a project that was doomed to failure. But this book is much more than an account of a naïve undertaking in the life of a rather strange man. For one thing, it radiates an intense intelligence and a candour that is never less than touching and, sometimes, downright heartrending. To have written so elegantly and often humorously about his mental health means Evans must now, to a great extent, be ‘better’. But it’s still an exercise in agonised soul-searching.","Less than ten years ago, Dylan Evans was a professional scientist .

"Drones could soon be delivering everything from drugs to clothing, if companies such as Amazon and Google have their way. And now that vision has come a step closer to reality after DHL was granted permission to carry out the first ever authorised drone delivery in Europe. The logistics firm, owned by Germany's Deutsche Post, will send its 'parcelcopter' flying at up to 40mph (65km/h) to the car-free island of Juist, off Germany's northern coast. Scroll down for video . Drones could soon be delivering everything from drugs to clothing, if companies such as Amazon and Google have their way. And now that vision has come a step closer to reality after DHL was granted permission to carry out the first ever authorised drone delivery in Europe. Pictured is DHL's parcelcopter . The drone is designed to deliver medication and other urgently needed goods to the island at times when other modes of transport are not operating. If the trial is successful, the craft could be used to deliver packages to other remote areas, or in emergencies. However, critics of delivery drones have raised concerns over privacy and whether the technology is safe, claiming drones could hit other aircraft or even people. For the Juist project, Deutsche Post has received permission from the German transport ministry and air traffic control authority for a restricted flight area that will be used only by its parcelcopter. The parcelcopter is designed to deliver medication and other urgently needed goods to the island at times when other modes of transport are not operating. If the trial is successful, the craft could be used to deliver packages to other remote areas or in emergencies . Yael Maguire, the engineering director at Facebook, recently revealed the firms solar-powered drones will be about the size of a 747, but lighter. This will let the plane fly at high altitudes of around 60,000ft (37,200 miles) or more, in order to stay above the weather. Facebook's ultimate goal is to build and launch a fleet of solar-powered drones that can connect billions of people all over the world who are currently living without the internet. Mr Maguire said he expects the drones to be ready to begin testing by next year. The drone will also not fly over any houses, a spokeswoman for DHL Parcel told Reuters. The craft has four rotors, weighs around 11lbs (5kg) and can carry loads of up to 2.6lbs (1.2kg). Its flight is completely automated, although it will be monitored from the ground and, depending on weather conditions, the 7 mile (12km) trip to Juist will take between 15 and 30 minutes. Flights to the North Sea island, home to around 1,700 people, will start from Friday, weather permitting, and will continue until the middle or end of October, the spokeswoman said. DHL joins the likes of Amazon and Google in testing the potential for drones to deliver parcels and packages. Google, for instance, has already built and tested self flying drones designed to deliver packages. Juist is one of the seven inhabited East Frisian Islands at the edge of the Lower Saxon Wadden Sea in the southern North Sea. Flights to the island, home to 1,700 people, will start from Friday, weather permitting, and will continue until the middle or end of October. It will be first to receive a drone delivery in Europe . Called Project Wing, its drones are being developed at Google X, the company's secret research lab, which is also developing its self-driving car and Glass wearable computer. Like DHL, the firm said the drones could eventually be used for disaster relief by delivering aid to isolated areas - and for package delivery. Amazon, meanwhile, is asking the Federal Aviation Administration for permission to use drones as part of its plan to deliver packages to customers in 30 minutes or less. The aircraft can travel at more than 50mph (80km/h) and carry loads of up to 5lbs (2.2kg). About 86 per cent of Amazon's deliveries are 5lbs (2.2kg) or less, the company said.

"Searching for the word ‘drunk’ on YouTube produces more than 10.7 million results. To study how these videos portray drinking and the dangers surrounding it, researchers analysed 70 of the most relevant and popular alcohol-related videos on the site. They discovered that in the world of YouTube, alcohol is funny, drinkers are attractive males and there are few consequences to getting drunk. Researchers from the University of Pittsburgh studied the 70 most popular alcohol-related videos on YouTube. Search terms included ‘drunk’, ‘buzzed,’ ‘hammered,’ ‘tipsy,’ and ‘trashed.’ The study found that videos tended to involve males more than females and almost half referred to a specific brand . ‘Several studies have linked watching movies containing alcohol abuse in them with actual alcohol-related behaviors,’ explained Dr Brian Primack, associate professor of medicine and pediatrics at the University of Pittsburgh. ‘These initial studies were cross-sectional, so it was hard to determine if exposures influenced the behaviours or if people who drank alcohol were drawn to alcohol-related media exposures. Researchers studied the 70 most relevant and popular videos on YouTube related to alcohol intoxication. Search terms included ‘drunk’, ‘buzzed,’ ‘hammered,’ ‘tipsy,’ and ‘trashed.’ They subsequently created 42 codes in six categories. These were video characteristics, character socio-demographics, alcohol depiction, degree of alcohol use, characteristics associated with alcohol, and consequences of alcohol. The 70 videos were each around four-minutes long and combined views exceeded a third of a billion. The videos tended to involve males more than females, and almost half (44 per cent) referred to a specific brand name of alcohol. In fact, 55 different brands featured across the 70 videos. While active intoxication was frequently shown (86 per cent), only 7 per cent of the clips referred to alcohol dependence or withdrawal. 'However, more recent longitudinal studies have suggested that media exposures can be influential.’ Yet YouTube hasn't been studied in this context and with a high degree of rigour, continued Dr Primack. ‘YouTube is an important medium to study for a couple of reasons,’ he continued. ‘If you want to learn about something in general, you will often 'Google' it. ‘However, more individuals are now going straight to YouTube for their searches, because it provides written information, visual information, and group discussion, all together.’ Dr Primack and his colleagues studied the 70 most relevant and popular videos on YouTube related to alcohol intoxication. Search terms included ‘drunk’, ‘buzzed,’ ‘hammered,’ ‘tipsy,’ and ‘trashed.’ They subsequently created 42 codes in six categories.

While active intoxication was frequently shown (86 per cent), only 7 per cent of clips referred to alcohol dependence or withdrawal. There were more 'likes' when humour was present versus when it was not, and more 'positive sentiment' when a brand name was mentioned, when liquor was mentioned, and when there was 'attractiveness' present. This was based on ratings of how attractive the people in each video were. And, there was less positive sentiment when negative emotional or physical consequences from alcohol use were shown. For example, videos featuring people injuring themselves received fewer likes. Elsewhere, hard liquor such as spirits and wine were more common than beer. ‘We are not sure why hard liquor was commonly represented, especially because beer is more frequently consumed in the US, and the vast majority of videos came from the US,’ said Dr Primack. ‘It may be because liquor has a high alcohol content, and so users may find it more edgy and interesting to post and/or view material related to this.’ Results are published in the journal Alcoholism: Clinical & Experimental Research.","Researchers studied the 70 popular alcohol-related videos on YouTube .

"The centre forward: The leader from the front, the No 9, the provider, the talisman, the goalscorer. Since 1992, the Premier League has been blessed with the best, from homegrown talents Alan Shearer and Andy Cole, to foreign imports Tony Yeboah and Thierry Henry. In this international week, we are begging for goals, and these lot put the ball in the back of the net and make it look easy. Here, Sportsmail runs you through Nos 50-41 of the best strikers to have ever graced the Premier League... do you agree? 50. Alan Smith (Leeds United, Manchester United, Newcastle United) Smith burst onto the scene as a teenager at Leeds, scoring on his first-team debut against Liverpool as an 18-year-old and proving an inspirational force in their memorable run to the semi-finals of the Champions League in 2001. Blessed with a tireless work rate, Smith was admired by the Elland Road faithful and twice voted the Supporters' Player of the Year. That turned to hatred when he joined Manchester United following Leeds’ relegation in 2004 and Smith was gradually converted into a central midfielder which curbed his goal threat. He scored 45 Premier League goals in total. Alan Smith celebrates scoring one of his 45 Premier League goals - against Southampton for Leeds in August 2001 . Smith is surrounded by journalists ahead of England's Euro 2004 qualifier against Slovakia in October 2002 . 49. Tony Yeboah (Leeds United) A Ghanaian striker with an eye for the spectacular, Yeboah illuminated Elland Road for two seasons in the mid-nineties, scoring 32 Premier League goals in 66 matches. Capable of beating defenders at will and with a rocket of a shot, Yeboah was a regular contributor to Goal of the Month shortlists. His volley against Liverpool and those kick-ups followed by a blistering shot against Wimbledon are the ones that stick in the memory. Tony Yeboah scores against Liverpool in 1995 with a ferocious volley, one of the most memorable goals in Premier League history . 48. Kevin Davies (Southampton, Blackburn Rovers, Bolton Wanderers) Davies first shot to Premier League prominence with Southampton in the 1997-98 season, grabbing the headlines with important goals against Man United, Chelsea and Liverpool. He failed to live up to his £7.5million price tag at Blackburn but did much better at Bolton after moving there in 2003. A bruiser of a frontman, Davies had his disciplinary problems but was a reliable goal-getter too. In all he scored 68 Premier League goals for the club, guaranteeing heroic status. Kevin Davies scoring against Tottenham in December 2000, but the bruiser made his biggest impact at Bolton Wanderers . Davies scored 68 Premier League goals for Bolton Wanderers, and had a superb finish on him as well as aerial prowess . 47. James Beattie (Blackburn Rovers, Southampton, Everton, Stoke City, Blackpool) Beattie forged a prolific career in the Premier League, scoring 90 goals in all for Southampton, Everton and Stoke City while also representing Blackburn and Blackpool. Part of the aforementioned deal that saw Kevin Davies move to Blackburn, he made a name for himself at Southampton with consistent goal returns. The 2002-03 campaign, in which he scored 23 league goals and helped them to the FA Cup final, was the highlight. He went to Everton in a £6m move in 2005 but couldn't find his Saints form. James Beattie enjoyed a superb season in 2002-03 with Southampton, scoring 23 goals and helping them to the FA Cup final . He then went to Everton in a £6m move in 2005 but couldn't find his Saints form, although he scored 90 Premier League goals in all . 46. Yakubu (Portsmouth, Middlesbrough, Everton, Blackburn Rovers) Plucked from the Israeli league by Harry Redknapp, Nigerian Yakubu proved a tremendous success in the Premier League. He helped establish Portsmouth as a top-flight club with 29 goals across two seasons, earning a £7.5m switch to ambitious Middlesbrough in 2005. He helped Boro to the UEFA Cup final during his first season, also scoring 13 in the league. Everton spent a club record £11.25m to sign him in 2007 but misfortune with injury after his first season there reduced his goal tally. Yakubu rediscovered his touch at Leicester in the Championship and then Blackburn, memorably scoring four in one game against Swansea. Yakubu, signed from Maccabi Haifa by Harry Redknapp, helped establish Portsmouth in the Premier League . He was given a move to Middlesbrough, where he appeared in a UEFA Cup final, before joining Everton for £11.25m . 45. Daniel Sturridge (Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool) One of the brightest and best strikers produced in this country in recent times, Sturridge has spectacularly realised his potential at Liverpool in the last couple of years. His 21 goals propelled them to within touching distance of a first Premier League title last season and his importance to the team has been highlighted by their travails in his absence through injury this time round. It is often forgotten that Sturridge, still only 25, started out at Manchester City before moving to Chelsea when first-team opportunities were not forthcoming. The 2011-12 campaign was the clear highlight of his time at Stamford Bridge but he has flourished at Anfield and is set be the main man for club and country for many years to come. Daniel Sturridge had to work hard for a regular run in a team, moving from Manchester City to Chelsea and then Liverpool . Sturridge's 21 goals for Liverpool propelled them to within touching distance of a first Premier League title last season . 44. Louis Saha (Newcastle United, Fulham, Manchester United, Everton, Tottenham, Sunderland) Fearsome French goalscorer Saha fired Fulham into the big time in 2001 with 27 goals in their promotion season. His strikes helped establish Fulham as a Premier League outfit, with the 13 in 21 he scored in the first portion of 2003-04 persuading Manchester United to fork out £12.4m for him. These weren’t the most successful of times for Sir Alex Ferguson’s side and Saha was by no means a first choice, a situation not helped by injury niggles. In all, he scored 28 goals at Old Trafford before joining Everton, helping them to the 2008 FA Cup final. Louis Saha scored 28 goals at Old Trafford before joining Everton, including this strike against Chelsea in 2006 . Saha celebrates scoring his first goal in the Premier League after helping Fulham to promotion from Division One . 43. Micky Quinn (Coventry City) Quinn was one of the hottest strikers in the Premier League when it launched in 1992 and had been a proven goalscorer for many years with the likes of Stockport, Oldham, Portsmouth and Newcastle United. That reliable scoring touch continued following a move to Coventry City and Quinn scored 10 goals in his first six matches in the new league. Sky Blues fans will fondly remember his Highbury hat-trick in a 3-0 win in 1993-94. Rather, let’s call him, stocky, Quinn had a few unflattering nicknames (his autobiography was called ‘Who Ate All The Pies?') but what a presence in the box! Micky Quinn celebrates his opening day hat-trick for Coventry City against Arsenal at Highbury in 1993 . 42. Peter Crouch (Aston Villa, Southampton, Liverpool, Tottenham, Stoke) Crouch has made a very successful career out of his freakish height, playing and scoring for half a dozen top-flight clubs as well as England, for whom he scored 22 in 42. ‘Two-metre Peter’ first made an impression at Portsmouth in the First Division and joined Villa and then Southampton. Their relegation in 2005 resulted in a £7m switch to Liverpool and he contributed 42 goals for the Reds after a slow start. His hat-trick against Arsenal in a 4-1 win back in 2007 was the highlight. Crouch went on to spend two years at Spurs before joining Stoke in 2010. He has 90 Premier League goals in total. Peter Crouch scoring against Manchester City in 2010 to hand Tottenham a fourth-place finish in the Premier League . Crouch has aerial ability at 6ft 7in and has scored a total of 90 Premier League goals in his career with five clubs . 41. Dimitar Berbatov (Tottenham, Manchester United, Fulham) Probably the most laid-back striker to play in the Premier League, Berbatov’s elegance and style yielded an impressive haul of goals. The Bulgarian arrived at White Hart Lane from Bayer Leverkusen for £10.9m in 2006 and he scored 27 times in league competition for Spurs in his two campaigns there. He was named the club’s Player of the Year and was in the PFA Team of the Year in his debut campaign, then helped them win the League Cup in 2008. That sparked interest from Man United, who paid a mammoth £30.75m for him. In all, he scored 48 league goals for the club, winning league winner’s medals in 2009 and 2011. Highlights include that hat-trick - including an overhead kick - in a 3-2 win over Liverpool and a five-goal haul against Blackburn. He scored 19 goals in 51 league games for Fulham after leaving Old Trafford in 2012. Dimitar Berbatov scores a deft free-kick against West Ham in 2007, one of 27 Premier League goals for Tottenham Hotspur .

"For more facts and stats from the Liberty Stadium go to our Match Zone . There was torrential rain in Swansea, a goal by Alexis Sanchez and the collapse of Arsenal’s painfully fragile defensive unit. Stop me if you’ve heard it before. Five days after his team surrendered a 3-0 lead in Europe against Anderlecht, Arsene Wenger saw another lead washed away. Only these lost points will perhaps prove even more damaging as defeat leaves Arsenal trailing a dozen points behind Barclays Premier League pacesetters Chelsea.

Referee: Phil Dowd. Attendance: 20,812. What a weekend it has been for Jose Mourinho and how Wenger must wonder if it would have been better to bid farewell in the afterglow of an FA Cup win at Wembley. His side struggle with familiar problems: the inability to defend a lead and the character to resist setbacks. Two clean sheets have been followed by two lost leads. For every step or two forward there is one back. The squad lacks depth in defence and the back four is being held together with sticking plaster. Regardless, Wenger maintains his footballing principles. As the Premier League breaks for international football, 11 games into the campaign, Arsenal feel too far off the pace. They are a point behind Swansea, who responded brilliantly after going behind in the 63rd minute. Garry Monk’s side were behind for 12 minutes before Gylfi Sigurdsson levelled with a superb free-kick and Bafetimbi Gomis scored in the winner, his first in the Premier League, seconds after coming on to replace Wilfried Bony. Swansea survived a chaotic finish and a desperate penalty appeal when a header from Yaya Sanogo skidded into Neil Taylor’s arm and, without injured wingers Nathan Dyer and Wayne Routledge and with Jonjo Shelvey suspended, they deserved their win. How they celebrated at the end, no-one more so than former Arsenal duo: goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski and centre back Kyle Bartley, starting his first Premier League game of the season. For an hour it had been a tense struggle, littered by fouls, cautions and treatment for injuries, contrary to expectations from two fluent passing teams. Swansea had started well, Arsenal fought back and, ultimately, Wenger’s team paid the price again for their inability to close ranks and protect a lead. Ecuadorian winger Jefferson Montero tormented Calum Chambers, who has the look of a talented teenager in need of a break. Montero was too quick and direct for Chambers and created the winner with a burst of acceleration down the left wing and a perfect cross for Gomis to head in.

Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny spreads himself as Ashley Williams (right) tries to poke the ball towards goal . Phil Dowd stayed consistent with select group refereeing style of not giving minor infringements by waving away Swansea penalty appeals midway through the first half when Calum Chambers pushed Wilfried Bony in the back right in front of him. It was a clear penalty to any neutral watching as Chambers had no possibility of playing the ball but just wanted to put Bony off. Law does not state that a push needs to be a big one! This policy of low level involvement does nothing to back up PGMOL claims that referees are 95 per cent accurate. GRAHAM POLL . Monk was rewarded for refusing to flinch. Gomis was stripped and ready to come on when Sigurdsson curled his free-kick over the defensive wall and into the top corner from 25 yards, beyond the dive of Wojciech Szczesny. Wenger disputed the free-kick but it was awarded after a cynical trip by Kieran Gibbs to halt a swift counter-attack by Modou Barrow, a Gambian striker. Monk went for the kill rather than attempt to protect the point. On went Gomis as planned and he had scored within seconds, after winning the ball and linking in with his midfield. Play was swept out to the Swansea left, where Montero tore past Chambers and clipped an inviting cross towards Gomis, who climbed above Aaron Ramsey and Nacho Monreal to thump his header inside the post. Arsenal had been 15 minutes from victory but were rarely comfortable and it is hard to escape the feeling that Swansea’s refusal to give up was motivated at least in part by the fact Wenger’s team are so brittle. They can be got at. It is not a new theory but there is, it seems, a psychological weakness within a superbly gifted team, and it is costing them in the toughest competitions.

Bony fell in a heap and there was exaggerated disbelief inside the Liberty Stadium as referee Phil Dowd ignored calls for a foul. It was the sort of reaction commonly found at the Emirates, but Monk has generated a similar feeling in South Wales, after an extended public whinge about poor decisions costing his team. Szczesny saved from Marvin Emnes, but Arsenal grew stronger as the first half progressed and their best moments revolved around Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, and his desire to run at defenders. Neil Taylor and Ki Sung-Yeung were cautioned for fouls on him and Dowd’s yellow card count was in double figures by the end. Fabianski thwarted Danny Welbeck, Ramsey lashed a volley close and Per Mertesacker beat Bartley to a corner only to head wide. The Polish goalkeeper, who left Arsenal after winning the FA Cup in May, also saved a skiddy drive by Santi Cazorla — but was unable to keep Sanchez at bay. Oxlade-Chamberlain broke out of defence, rode an attempted trip by Tom Carroll and found Cazorla. He released Welbeck who pulled his cross deep to Sanchez. The Chilean swept the ball into the net. It was his 12th in 14 games, but that is not where Wenger has problems. It is at the other end, where it always has been. The heavens opened and Arsenal went under.

"Protection: Agents protecting Francois Hollande (pictured) would have been brandishing pretend weapons . Elite secret agents sent to protect France’s new president Francois Hollande at a major overseas meeting forgot to pack their guns, it has emerged. In scenes straight out of an Inspector Clouseau film, highly-trained members of the GSPR (Security Group of the Presidency of the Republic) thought they had placed their weapons in secure suitcases when they travelled to Rio Earth summit last week. In fact there had been an oversight, and when the unit’s luggage was inspected in Brazil in accordance with diplomatic protocol the guns were not there. This meant that the agents wearing sunglasses and earpieces around Mr Hollande would have been brandishing ‘pretend’ guns in their shoulder holsters. Brazil has some of the worst gun crime figures in the world, meaning the French service personnel would have felt particularly vulnerable. ‘As far as anyone can remember, this was the first time this has happened,’ one officer insisted to the French investigative weekly Le Canard Enchaine, which in turn suggested that the agents were ‘ready to fight with their bare hands.’ There were few jokes back at the Elysee Palace in Paris, however. When the diplomatic party including Mr Hollande were safely back in France, the agent responsible for the fiasco was duly sacked. Faux pas: The agents' blunder has been compared with Peter Sellers' bungling Inspector Clouseau character . The President of France is widely . considered to be the second most powerful executive position in the . world after the American President. There have been numerous attempts to assassinate the holder of the job in recent years, with the GSPR set up in 1983 to give him maximum protection. Following an attempted bomb attack on Jacques Chirac in 2002 the number of officers in the unit was increased to 60, and all are firearms specialists. One of Mr Hollande’s first acts on taking office in May was to increase the number of women in the GSPR, including appointing a female head – the first in its history. Hapless: Highly-trained members of the GSPR thought they had placed their weapons in secure suitcases when they travelled to Rio Earth summit (pictured) Jacques Clouseau was the hapless fictional French detective in the Pink Panther film comedies. Made famous by the British actor Peter Sellers, he famously employed a martial arts expert called Cato to periodically ‘attack’ him in his Paris flat so as to sharpen his bare-handed fighting skills. Cato would frequently appear at the wrong moments, however, leading Clouseau to shout: ‘Not now, Cato!’. The Elysee Palace would not comment on the latest real-life security scandal ‘for security reasons.’",Elite agents discovered their weapons were missing when they arrived in Brazil for the Rio Earth summit .
"Graduate students have used a 3D printer to make a limb for a six-year-old boy born without a right arm. Alex Pring, from Groveland, Florida, was given the new prosthetic arm on Friday by a team headed by University of Central Florida student Albert Manero. The limb took seven weeks for the team to build in their free time and cost $350 - compared to the $40,000 that doctors told Alex's family a prosthetic arm would cost. After the little boy put on the arm, which senses muscles in his shoulder and opens and closes, he grinned and gave his mother a hug - the first time he had been able to put two arms around her. Scroll down for video . New possibilities: Six-year-old Alex Pring, who was born without a right arm, speaks with Albert Manero, a University of Central Florida student who built Alex a prosthetic arm with a 3D printer . Getting ready: The engineering students can be seen hooking up the boy's new arm last week . 'I feel good,' Alex told reporters. 'I feel everything good, even my robot arm. It's not even heavy.' The team started building the arm after Manero, an aerospace engineering PhD student, began thinking about how to help the family after reading a letter Alex's mother posted online. On a website for a community devoted to making prosthetic hands, Alyson Pring that because her son had been born without an arm, their insurance company wouldn't cover the costs. The costs are so steep for childhood prosthetics because of their quick rate of growth and the need to always be replacing the limbs. Manero was driving his car when he heard a story on the radio about a man in South Africa who used a 3D printer to make a new hand. 'I was really inspired,' he said. 'When I got back, I talked to my colleagues and friends and said, ""We can do this"".' First hug: Afterwards, the first thing Alex did was run to his mother for his first ever hug with two arms . Trying it out: Alex shakes hands with a reporter after receiving the new limb on Friday. His family had struggled to afford the $40,000 that doctors said it would cost to give the boy an arm . Getting used to it: Alex plays with a ball next to his grandfather after getting the arm, which reacts to muscles in his shoulder. He can open and close the hand and the battery lasts for a whole day . The team - including friends who study electrical, . mechanical and civil engineering - got to work on the arm, which is activated by the electromyography muscle . energy on Alex's bicep, UCFToday reported. By July, they had a large working prototype and they then got to work on making a smaller version. While the batteries can be bought from stores, Stratasys, one of the biggest commercial 3D printer makers in the . nation, also donated some of the supplies. 'My mother taught us that we’re supposed to help change . the world,' Manero said. 'We’re supposed to . help make it better. That's why we did it. The look on Alex’s face when . he used it for the first time was priceless.' He added that the boy seemed to get used to the arm pretty quickly. 'The first thing he did when he could actually control it a little bit . was hug his mother,' he said. 'He said it was their first real hug. There wasn't a . dry eye in the room.' Life changing: Alex is pictured grinning with his new arm with Manero, who came up with the idea . Thankful: Moreno, pictured hugging Alex, is now developing another printed arm for a second family . When he out-grows the arm, it'll cost just $20 for a new hand and $40 to . $50 for a new forearm. Manero later put the plans of the design online so that others could download them for free and improve them. 'I have no doubt that the international community will try to move this technology forward and lower the cost,' he said. Manero, a . Fulbright Scholar, heads to Germany in August to work for the German . Aerospace Center, but he has already promised to help another family . with an arm, so he'll remain committed to the project even when he's . abroad. 'I think 3D printing is revolutionizing our world in . many ways,' he said. 'I believe changing the world of prosthetics is very real. There's no reason why this approach shouldn’t work on adults too.'","Alex Pring was born without a right arm and his family could not afford the steep cost to get him a prosthetic one .

"PETA claims to be the world's leading animal rights charity - but this shocking picture of garbage bags filled with dead cats has led to claims that the group is actually abusing animals rather than helping them. The photograph shows the interior of a dumpster outside a North Carolina supermarket, which reportedly contains a pile of garbage bags each filled with the dead cats. The picture is one of many photos that Nathan Winograd claims depict rampant animal abuse at the organization that took the felines in with the promise of finding them homes. Bloodshed: Piles of garbage bags containing dead cats are pictured outside PETA's Virginia headquarters . The photo was taken in 2007, when two PETA employees were charged with animal cruelty in connection to the dead cats, according to the Roanoke-Chowan News-Herald. Veterinarians testified in the case that the cats found in the bags were found to be healthy before their deaths. In another photo provided by Mr Winograd, a 'pet-killing kit' that was found in the back of a PETA van is seen. Mr Winograd, the director of the No Kill . Advocacy Center, says that images such as this exhibit the horrific reality of pets that enter PETA's doors - and don't make it out. He claims that PETA has killed more than 29,426 animals in . the last 11 years. Winograd branded the animal rights group 'little more than a slaughterhouse' in a February blog post. Saddening: More than 1,0000 cats were euthanized by PETA last year, according to statistics from the Virginia Department for Agriculture and Consumer Services . In an emailed statement, PETA spokesman Ben Williamson said: 'Anyone who is shocked to learn how many animals have to be euthanized annually in the U.S. should ask themselves if they're spaying and neutering their own companion animals, adopting from shelters instead of buying from breeders and pet stores and demanding higher animal-care standards in their own communities. And more importantly, they should look at the photos of animals PETA U.S. served in the impoverished areas in the vicinity of its headquarters in Virginia.' Mr Williamson added that the euthanasia figures are distorted, and do not include the almost 10,000 dogs . and cats PETA provided with no-cost to low-cost sterilization . services, the number of animals delivered to large high-traffic . facilities for adoption, as well as counseling and preventive services. The organization has released a video of its own that examines the danger of no-kill shelters, which Williamson says turn away animals due to overcrowding. Watch video here . Euthanasia: This 'pet killing kit' was found by police officers in the back of a PETA van, according to Winograd . PETA told MailOnline last month that the animals they take in at the center are 'unadoptable.' In figures from the Virginia Department for Agriculture and Consumer Services last month, it was revealed that PETA killed nearly 90 per cent of dogs and cats placed in the care of the shelter at its headquarters last year. The charity, well-known for attention grabbing publicity campaigns such as the 'I'd rather go naked' anti-fur campaign, euthanized 1,647 cats and dogs last year and only placed 19 in new homes according to data submitted to the Virginia Department for Agriculture and Consumer Services. However, the figure that 89.4 per cent of euthanized animals is much higher than their own approximation that half of pets taken to shelters end up being killed. According to the statistics 1,110 cats and 733 dogs were handed in to the charity in 2012. 22 . cats and 108 dogs were transferred to another shelter, two cats and . three dogs were reclaimed by their owner while 1,045 cats and 602 dogs were . euthanized. Criticism: PETA, well-known for its hard-hitting adverts such as the one pictured, has come under fire for the number of animals it kills at its shelter in Norfolk, Virginia . Defense: The charity says euthanasia at its Virginia HQ shelter, pictured, is a 'necessary evil' as aside from those suffering they can't find homes for all the cats and dogs handed to them . 34 cats and 7 dogs were placed under a category entitled 'Miscellaneous.' The statistics have been promoted by a restaurant advocacy coalition called Center for Consumer Freedom, which has had numerous run-ins with the charity in the past. Justin Wilson, CCF's senior research analyst said: 'The animal rights group is talking out of both sides of its mouth – on one side preaching its animal liberation agenda, while on the other signing the death warrant of over 89 percent of pets in its care. It’s beyond hypocritical.' 'It seems PETA is more dedicated to . publicity stunts than to keeping the animals in its own care alive. It’s . the height of hypocrisy for PETA to demonstrate for the 'rights' of . rats and pigs, while killing tens of thousands of pets. It’s time that . the Commonwealth of Virginia finally reclassifies PETA’s pet shelter for . what it is – a slaughterhouse.' A PETA spokeswoman told MailOnline that they had no choice but to euthanize the animals. Well-known campaigns: The charity often uses celebrities for its hard-hitting campaigns. It was accused today of being more interested in 'publicity stunts than keeping animals alive' Campaigns: Among its many projects PETA encourages vegetarianism and veganism and is against animal testing . 'We . have a small division that does hands-on work with animals, and most of . the animals we take in are society's rejects; aggressive, on death's . door, or somehow unadoptable,' she said. 'CCF's goal is to damage PETA by misrepresenting the situation and the number of unwanted and suffering animals PETA euthanizes because of injury, illness, age, aggression, and other problems, because their guardians requested it, or because no good homes exist for them.' A later statement added: 'PETA . refers adoptable animals to the high-traffic open-admission shelters . where they have the best chance of being seen and finding a new home.' In a 2009 blog . the charity wrote about their opposition to 'no-kill' animal shelters . saying they often get filled and just have to turn animals away. It said in some cases euthanasia is a necessary evil and PETA is willing to do 'society's dirty work.' Sex sells: PETA often uses models in their campaigns. They hit out at critics of euthanasia at their cat and dog shelters yesterday saying it received many unadoptable pets . 'As long as animals are still purposely bred and people aren't spaying and neutering their companions, open-admission animal shelters and organizations like PETA must do society's dirty work. Euthanasia is not a solution to overpopulation but rather a tragic necessity given the present crisis,' it said. In response to the post, supporters of the charity were torn on the issue but many said a charity in its position on issues such as medical testing, the fur trade and as advocates for veganism should never allow the killing of healthy animals over a lack of suitable home. 'In my book, the only time it's acceptable to kill animals is the same as the only time it's acceptable to kill people: when their illness is painful and terminal.' 'Anything else is a speciesist double standard. As soon as I hear of a campaign to kill homeless people because it's 'more humane' then I might consider it an acceptable option for homeless animals too,' said one post.","Nathan Winograd, the director of the No Kill Advocacy Center, claims that PETA has killed nearly 30,000 animals in the last 11 years .
PETA says euthanasia figures are 'distorted,' and do not include the nearly 10,000 animals saved and put up for adoption ."

Kramer's misfortune also gave his own team their first defeat in 19 matches in all competitions this season and lifted Dortmund, Bundesliga runners-up for the last two seasons, off the bottom of the table.

Kramer has his hands on his head after his second-half own goal gifted Borussia Dortmund a crucial lead . Dortmund had thrown everything at Gladbach and seemed to be running out of options until Kramer, substituted in the World Cup final against Argentina after a clash of heads, did their job for them in the 58th minute. Gladbach were calmly playing the ball around in their own half when it was passed to Kramer and he over-hit an attempted lob back to goalkeeper Sommer, who watched it sail over his head into the net. Dortmund should have been out of sight by then after outplaying third-placed Gladbach. Marco Reus broke down left and fired across the face of the goal in the second minute and then saw his shot tipped onto the post by Sommer. Lukasz Piszczek miscued wildly after being set free by Henrikh Mkhitaryan on the right and the Armenian also fired over from a similar position after Sven Bender opened up the Gladbach defence.

"Read Matt Barlow's match report from the Liberty Stadium here . Arsene Wenger threw in the towel on the title race on Sunday evening after watching Arsenal blow another winning position at Swansea. The Gunners surrendered a lead at the Liberty Stadium, with Garry Monk's side scoring twice in three minutes through Gylfi Sigurdsson and Bafetimbi Gomis to turn the game on its head. Alexis Sanchez had put the visitors in front, but they weren't able to hold on for the second time in a week. VIDEO Scroll down for Arsene Wenger: We were in control but let Swansea back in game . Arsene Wenger looked unimpressed as his side gave up a lead for the second time in less than a week . Bafetimbi Gomis (second left) out-jumps Nacho Monreal to score the winning goal, as Arsenal collapsed again . Swansea's Wayne Routledge mocked Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez after his over-confident tweet on Saturday . ‘Chelsea are on an average of 100 points this season,’ the Arsenal boss explained. ‘If you look at the number of points they have, if they keep that up nobody will catch them. ‘There doesn’t look to be anybody capable of challenging them at the moment.’ Wenger was far less impressed with his own side, who led through Sanchez before a wonderful Sigurdsson free-kick and Gomis’s header left the Gunners 12 points off the pace. The turnaround followed their stunning Champions League capitulation from 3-0 up against Anderlecht in midweek, in which they stuttered to a 3-3 draw. Wenger said: ‘Chelsea are on an average of 100 points this season. If you look at the number of points they have, if they keep that up nobody will catch them, that’s for sure. ‘There doesn’t look to be anybody capable of challenging them at the moment.’ He added: ‘We had a very disappointing week, considering the performances we produced and the end results we got are very disappointing. ‘We were 3-0 up against Anderlecht and 1-0 up here and in the end we lose two points against Anderlecht and three points against Swansea. I think it’s very, very disappointing because you have to be capable, once you are 1-0 up and a big team, to win the game.’ Wenger was at a loss to explain the latest collapse, in which Mathieu Flamini looked furious after being substituted for Jack Wilshere in the second half and then stormed down the tunnel at full time. Gylfi Sigurdsson's stunning free kick flies past Wojciech  Szczesny to level the game for Swansea . Wenger can only watch on as his team again lost a game he believes they should have won . Wenger admitted Flamini’s behaviour ‘is not my biggest worry at the moment’ as he rued a missed chance to climb back into the top four. ‘I don’t know how damaging it is (to morale), but in the table certainly it’s very disappointing,’ he said. ‘We had an opportunity to come back into the top four in a bit more of a comfortable way. That we didn’t take it is disappointing.’ He added: ‘It’s unfortunate to lose a game like that. We produced quite a decent performance for 75 minutes but you have to last 90 minutes. Did Tuesday night play a part in our mind? I don’t think so. I hope not. ‘You have to give Swansea credit - they didn’t give up, they fought until the end, they scored a good free-kick and in the end we lost the three points. That’s very sad.’ Monk, who has guided Swansea to fifth in his first campaign as permanent manager, said: ‘We saw what happened in midweek (to Arsenal) but we prepared for the Arsenal we all know. I know they suffered in midweek but they are dangerous. We managed them very well. ‘We are very happy going into the international break with the points that we have.’ Alexis Sanchez had put the Gunners into the lead in the second half after a clinical counter-attack .

"A Chilean artist has been found dead on the famous Brazilian staircase he spent his working life transforming. Jorge Selaron's body was discovered on the 215-step staircase in the bohemian neighbourhood of Lapa in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday. Police refused to disclose the cause of death but have not ruled out murder and are investigating reports he had received death threats. Visitors look on as Jorge Selaron's body lies on the staircase he spent his life decorating and which became known as 'Selaron Stairs' The artist, 65, was said to have become depressed in recent months after receiving threats, which he claimed had come from someone who had worked in his workshop. Neighbours, tourists and well-wishers braved heavy rain to pay tribute to Selaron, who turned the staircase leading up to St Teresa Convent from a dank and dreary scene to a multi-coloured 'tribute to the Brazilian people'. His body was discovered in front his house, which faces the staircase. The steps had become known as Escadaria Selaron (Selaron Stairs) since he started work on the project in 1990. Friends and collaborators from around the world sent or took tiles to contribute to the steps' facade after he began tiling them and collecting old porcelain bathtubs to use as planters along the sides. The artist was a well-known figure in Rio, with his sweeping handlebar . moustache and friendly demeanour. The candy-coloured steps became a city landmark in 2005 and the artist was declared an honorary Carioca, or Rio resident. 'We . can speak of Lapa before and after Selaron. He changed the face of Rio. His death is something brutish, that makes no sense,' said Jocimar . Batista de Jesus, aka Mestre Duda Pirata, a capoeira master who also . lives along the steps. Jorge Selaron was well known in the district of Lapa and would pose with tourists visiting the steps . The artist's body is guarded by armed police, left, before being taken away on Thursday . 'He had no resources, no support from the city,' he added. 'The neighbours helped as they could. I brought him tiles from my trips, from Spain, Holland, as I travelled. As it grew, people began to contribute, to send him tiles, to bring them to Rio when they came to visit.' The hundreds of tiles depict subjects ranging from a woman in traditional Portugese dress, a seated Buddha, Indian deities, Bob Marley, antique French tiles and others with Arabic calligraphy. Tour guide  Alejandro Martin Barreira said: 'Here in Lapa everyone knew him; he was the face of this bohemian, artistic neighbourhood. 'He was a simple man, who loved this life, sitting here, watching the kids play, chatting people up.' Selaron wanted his staircase to last a lifetime. 'I will only end this mad and singular dream on the last day of my life,' he wrote on the wall nearby. Several steps above, an anonymous contributor answered written on a plain tile painted in the green and yellow of the Brazilian flag: 'Obrigado, Selaron.' 'Thank you, Selaron.'","Jorge Selaron was discovered on the staircase outside his house in Rio .

"It may only be November, but Arsenal's chances of achieving anything this season are already looking bleak. Sunday's miserable defeat at Swansea City has left them 12 points adrift of pace-setters Chelsea in the Premier League, while performances in Europe have mostly been equally uninspiring. Sure, there have been injury problems, but many fans believe Arsene Wenger should have done more to add depth to his squad. As the pressure again mounts on the Frenchman, we take a look at the important questions being asked of Arsenal and whether they can be addressed. Arsenal slipped to defeat at Swansea City on Sunday, meaning they are 12 points behind leaders Chelsea . Questions are again being asked of manager Arsene Wenger as Arsenal's chances of silverware fade . Per Mertesacker is left shell-shocked after the Gunners' abject loss at the Liberty Stadium . Arsenal are already 12 points behind Chelsea, struggling in Europe and out of the Capital One Cup... what's going on at the Emirates this season? After ending their nine-year trophy drought by winning the FA Cup and cementing a top-four finish, morale was high heading into the new season. Unlike previous campaigns, no major players had been sold and Wenger had captured Alexis Sanchez from Barcelona. The addition of the Community Shield with a comfortable 3-0 win against Manchester City left many Arsenal fans giddy and expectant. But with only four wins in the league this season - against current bottom-seven sides Burnley, Sunderland, Aston Villa and Crystal Palace - and two in the Champions League, against teams ranked only 35th and 44th in Europe, Gooners are feeling rather deflated... and it's only November. Arsenal ended their nine-year trophy drought when they defeated Hull City in May's FA Cup final at Wembley . Alexis Sanchez has been a rare positive for Arsenal and he scored his 12th goal of the season on Sunday . The loss at Swansea left Arsenal sixth, 12 points behind Premier League leaders Chelsea . Injuries have obviously played their part... Yes. Olivier Giroud, Mesut Ozil, Mikel Arteta, Mathieu Debuchy, Jack Wilshere, Theo Walcott and Laurent Koscielny have all missed large chunks of the campaign - and in some cases are still out. Is that why Nacho Monreal is playing at centre half? It is. But Wenger should have bought more defensive re-inforcements. He allowed Bacary Sagna, Thomas Vermaelen and Carl Jenkinson to leave in the summer and brought in only Debuchy, who has been sidelined since September, and 19-year-old Calum Chambers, who was miserably exposed by Swansea's Jefferson Montero. Monreal is as much of a centre half as he is a striker, and it doesn't help that Per Mertesacker is suffering from a World Cup hangover. Arsenal have conceded more headed goals than any team bar Burnley this campaign. Wenger will be desperate for Koscielny to return. Laurent Koscielny, who has struggled with an achilles injury, has been a big miss for Arsenal . Nacho Monreal (right) was called into action at centre half again at Swansea and struggled . Calum Chambers was exposed by the pace of Jefferson Montero in Sunday's match . Where's the leadership? That's one of the central problems; there isn't. Arsenal inexplicably threw away a three-goal lead against Anderlecht after searching for more goals instead of holding what they had. And they performed the same suicidal act at the Liberty Stadium on Sunday. Seven Arsenal players were ahead of the ball when they lost possession leading up to Swansea's equaliser. The Gunners have thrown away more points from a winning position than any other team this season. So perhaps Paul Merson has a point when he called Wenger's side 'tactically clueless' on 11 occasions last week? Wenger boasted Tony Adams, Patrick Vieira and Thierry Henry as his first three captains at Arsenal. Leaders on and off the pitch. But his last four have included Williams Gallas (histrionic), Robin van Persie (left for Manchester United) Vermaelen (injured/out of form) and Arteta (best of a bad bunch). That says it all. Wenger reacts with dismay as his team surrender a three-goal lead to draw with Anderlecht . Captain Mikel Arteta limps off during the home draw with Anderlecht, the latest of his injury woes . Who should Wenger be targeting in January? He desperately needs a centre half and a holding midfielder to add some much-needed steel to that talented, but attack-minded and arguably flakey midfield. Mats Hummels is interested in a move to the Emirates and surely Wenger should have swooped for Alex Song in the summer. He has shone at Upton Park this year and was a revelation for the Gunners before he left for Barcelona. Sami Khedira could do a job and what of Chelsea's John Obi Mikel? He isn't getting a game at Stamford Bridge... Borussia Dortmund's Mats Hummels is likely to be in demand in January and Arsenal have been linked to him . Alex Song has been excellent for West Ham this season, raising questions as to why Wenger didn't sign him . But some fans are saying it isn't who Wenger brings in, but his tactics and where he plays those new signings. Why, for instance, has Mesut Ozil been deployed on the left? Shouldn't they be building the team around him? He should. In the rare moments Ozil played at No 10, he's excelled. He isn't the same player on the left. In his early years, Wenger built his team around Dennis Bergkamp, and then Henry. Now he seems unsure who his best player is, or indeed what's his best team. In Sanchez, Santi Cazorla, Wilshere, Ramsey, and even Ozil when he is fit, he has too many players who want to do the same job. It isn't working. Mesut Ozil's talents have been wasted playing on the left instead of in the No 10 role . Sanchez has been Arsenal's brightest spark, but is he in a class of one? The £30million man works his socks off and has been involved in seven of Arsenal's last eight goals in the Premier League. Without him they'd be even worse off. Ramsey has looked a shadow of the player who lit up the Premier League last term. Ozil, on the left, was desperately short of confidence and form before he got injured. Danny Welbeck has done OK, but will never be in the same bracket as Bergkamp, Henry, or Ian Wright. Oxlade-Chamberlain was Arsenal's best player on Sunday, but needs a consistent run in the team while Cazorla has gone off the boil and injury-prone Wilshere is struggling for form. Sanchez looks exasperated with his team-mates as a move breaks down against Swansea . Danny Welbeck has performed fairly well this season but is not in the class of Henry or Bergkamp . VIDEO We didn't perform until the final whistle - Wenger . Arsenal fans must be worried about Chelsea matching, or even bettering, the Invincibles? Sadly, as with Liverpool, Arsenal fans can only boast about their past. As Chelsea have cantered to league and cup titles - not to mention that European Cup triumph in 2012 - Arsenal have won only the FA Cup. Now Jose Mourinho's juggernaut could go the season unbeaten - probably with more points and fewer defeats. That would be an extremely bitter pill for Arsenal supporters to swallow... Arsene Wenger shows off the Premier League trophy after his 'Invincibles' won the title in 2004 . More so than Cesc Fabregas joining Chelsea in the summer? He's been one of the Premier League's best players this season. Wenger had first refusal, so why didn't he sign him? Fabregas and Ozil could not have played in the same side, and when you've spent a club record fee on a player why would you undermine that by bringing in someone who lines up in the same position? Nor can we forget Ramsey’s breakthrough campaign last year. Fabregas was undoubtedly a star player, who stood head and shoulders above his peers, but he is also one who personified a different Wenger era – a move away from the power of Emmanuel Petit, Vieira, Henry and Co and one built around slighter, diminutive players, albeit as skilful – but which ultimately has proved to be nowhere near as successful. Despite his success at Chelsea this season, signing him would have been a step back. Cesc Fabregas has been classy for Chelsea this season but wouldn't have fitted in at Arsenal . Some Arsenal supporters were calling for Wenger to leave after Arsenal's defeat at Swansea. Is it time for him to go? Arsenal fans would have been desperate for the club to kick on after last season's FA Cup triumph, but it appears as though they will be battling only for a top-four finish this season. They seem miles short of what is required to launch an assault on the Champions League. Wenger's stubbornness to adapt his tactics when facing bigger teams is alarming. So too is the fact that his players don't seem to understand the concept of defending as a team. While his squad must take some responsibility for that, doesn't it ultimately fall down to the man who organises them? No longer can Wenger, or indeed the fans blame, a lack of spending either. More than £40m was spent on Ozil and almost £50m on acquiring Sanchez and Welbeck. Is Wenger's time up at Arsenal? Perhaps... but don't expect him to walk away any time soon. What should Arsenal fans be hoping for during the remainder of the season? Sadly for them a decent run in the FA Cup, a battle for the top four, and probably an exit from Europe at the round of 16 stage when they draw one of the competition’s top clubs.

"A cyclist was left in disbelief when he spotted what is thought to be the UK's shortest cycle lane - at just six foot. It appears next to a shared space pavement for pedestrians and cyclists, but has left riders baffled as to why they even bothered. The lane appears out of nowhere, with no other cycle paths in sight, before stopping abruptly just a few feet later when the road hits a junction. The cycle lane, in Frampton Cotterell, Bristol is only six feet long and believed to be the UK's shortest cycle lane . Logan, 4, uses the tiny cycle path in Frampton Cotterell, near Bristol, which is only six feet long . The tiny cycle track is situated on a junction between Heather Avenue and Park Lane in South Gloucestershire . Cyclist David Stone spotted the new lane in Frampton Cotterell, Bristol. He said: 'Is this the shortest cycle lane in the UK? 'I have no idea how long it has been there but a new mini roundabout has recently been located in Heather Avenue, so it may be that they had some paint left over.' This cycle lane in Beetwell Street, Chesterfield, is only 13 feet long. It was painted in April this year by Derbyshire County Council but has already been slammed by the town's cycling community . The bike lane on Ridgeway in Plymouth, Devon was created in December 2012 and is just 8ft 2ins, barely longer than a bike. It was defended by Plymouth council as they said it did not cost them anything . This bike lane on Ridgeway in Plymouth, Devon, was ridiculed by the town's cyclists when it was built in 2012 . South Gloucestershire Council said the cycle lane, situated on a junction between Heather Avenue and Park Lane, had nothing to do with them. A spokesman said: 'It is believed that it is there to protect cyclists who have returned to the road. 'In the planning application for the development, there is an agreement to provide for safety at road junctions.' The cycle lane was created by developer Barratt Homes, who inserted the lane when completing a nearby housing estate as cyclists join the road from a shared pavement. A spokesman for Barratt Homes said: 'The cycleway markings are on the road as part of the termination on the shared footpath and cycleway along Heather Avenue and have been installed as part of the technical requirements of South Gloucestershire Highways under the planning consent and road adoption agreement.' This is not the first time ridiculously short bike lanes have been marked out on British roads. In December 2012, bungling council workers created a bike lane, measuring just 8ft 2ins, on Ridgeway in Plymouth, Devon. A council spokesman said the path did not council anything and was added because it alerted cyclists to the left hand turn into a new facility. The 8ft stretch of cycle lane in Cardiff city centre cost an estimated £2,000 when it was completed in 2010 . Cardiff Council officials spent an estimated £2,000 in painting the red and white markings on the tiny stretch . Elsewhere, council workers in Cardiff were criticised for building an 8ft bike lane in 2010 at the estimated cost of £2,000. Welsh cyclists were left baffled with the logic behind the lane when an official told them it was to 'highlight the interface between the eastbound carriageway and the beginning of a new contraflow facility'. Most recently, cyclists ridiculed a decision to create a path - sandwiched between two junctions - in Chesterfield. The 13 foot cycle lane in Beetwell Street in Chesterfield was developed in April this year and Derbyshire county council bosses said it offered a useful link in a much longer bike route in the town. But users said officials could have saved themselves the bother of marking its start and finish with painted signs – which are squeezed in next to each other on the small patch of pavement.","Cycle lane, in Frampton Cotterell, South Gloucestershire, is only six feet .

"West Ham's in-form striker Diafra Sakho faces up to a month on the sideline with a shoulder injury. The Senegalese was substituted late on after picking up the knock during the Hammers' impressive 2-1 victory over Manchester City at Upton Park on Saturday. If Sakho is out for a month he would miss West Ham's matches against Stoke, Aston Villa and Everton. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Diafra Sakho gives  the thumbs up  after scoring  during West Ham United's 2-1 win over Manchester City . Sakho faces a month on the sideline after picking up a shoulder injury against Manchester City . Stoke (a) November 1 . Aston Villa (h) November 8 . Everton (a) November 22 . The 24-year-old was given a standing ovation by the West Ham faithful when substituted having grabbed the winner with a powerful header which City goalkeeper Joe Hart was unable to prevent crossing the line. The striker was Sakho's seventh in as many games and made him only the second player after Micky Quinn to net in his first six Premier League starts. Hammers boss Sam Allardyce will be hoping the early prognosis is exaggerated and that Sakho will be able to resume his fruitful partnership with fellow summer-signing Enner Valencia sooner rather than later. Sakho celebrates scoring West Ham's second goal in the 2-1 win against Man City with Cheikhou Kouyate . The Senegalese forward's header was awarded by the Goal Decision System after Joe Hart tried to save it . A £4.5million signing from Ligue 2 side Metz, Sakho was one of West Ham's lower-profile summer recruits but he has quickly become one of the fans' favourites. It will be a serious blow to Allardyce and his side, who sit fourth in the Premier League. In fact, Sakho's start has been so impressive that the club are already looking to offer him a contract with improved terms just two-and-a-half months into the season to deter potential suitors. West Ham manager Sam Allardyce will not want to lose his in-form striker Sakho for any length of time .","Diafra Sakho has scored seven goals in seven games for West Ham United .

"Dejan Lovren's wife posted her dismay on Instagram after her husband was dropped from the Liverpool squad that lost 1-0 to Real Madrid in the Bernabeu. Seven first-team regulars, also including skipper Steven Gerrard, Raheem Sterling and Mario Balotelli, were rested on Tuesday night, which led to accusations of Brendan Rodgers waving the white flag in Madrid. Anita Lovren made the trip to the game at the Bernabeu and posted a picture of their daughter in the stands, apparently confused by why her father didn’t make the side.

The image had the caption ‘Why my daddy doesn’t play????’, which suggests that despite Lovren's struggles this season, his family did not think he deserved to miss out completely at the Bernabeu. Lovren was replaced in the Liverpool line-up by Kolo Toure as the visitors' rearguard action meant Real only came out with a 1-0 victory. And the fear for the Croatia centre half, bought for £20million from Southampton in the summer, is that he will not find his way back into the side after Toure's impressive display at the heart of the defence. Toure said: 'I have missed games like this. 'I play with my heart and I am ready to fight for my club. 'These are the kind of games you remember all your life. The last game I played here was with Arsenal when we won. 'People were saying we had no chance against Real Madrid but that gave us motivation. 'When you don't play a lot and a manager gives you a chance to show what you can do you give everything you have got. 'That is what happened and that's the way we need to play in every game now.

"On the eve of its launch in Britain and Europe, the Mazda2 has been named Car of the Year in its native Japan. Mazda promises great performance, economy, safety and driving fun when the supermini reaches Britain early next year, priced from around £13,000. The five-door hatchback will be 'clever, comfortable and confident' with 'convention-challenging capabilities', the firm says. It features the first head-up display in its class, allowing the driver to see key information on the windscreen as he or she looks at the road ahead. The five-door hatchback will be 'clever, comfortable and confident' with 'convention-challenging capabilities', the firm says . The new Skyactiv-D 1.5-litre engine promises low CO2 emissions of 89g/km. There will be five and six-speed manual verions, plus a six-speed automatic transmission option. Safety features include a blind-spot monitoring system. The 50th anniversary of the Government's first drink-drive campaign this week shows how far attitudes have changed in five decades — with nine in ten drivers now agreeing that driving after drinking alcohol is wrong. To illustrate this, the Government released some vintage campaign adverts spanning the decades. But when I viewed that first black-and-white film from 1964 — showing a lively Christmas party and warning how downing four whiskies will double your risk of an accident — it wasn't the drinkdrive message that hit home. Nor how much fashions have changed. No. It was the voiceover message: 'If he's been drinking, don't let him drive,' followed by the printed strapline: 'Don't ask a man to drink and drive.' With women now accounting for nearly half the motorists on the road, that smacks today like the sort of off-key refrain you'd hear from comedian Al Murray as the Pub Landlord: 'And will that be a Snowball or Babycham for the lady?' Times really have changed. Bad news for cyclists as the latest official road casualty figures show an alarming rise in the number of road users killed or seriously injured. Officials blamed 'warmer weather' for bringing out more 'vulnerable' road users such as cyclists on to the nation's highways. From April to June this year 18 per cent more cyclists were killed or seriously injured than in the same period last year. And for 12 months to June there was a 10 per cent rise in these figures. As it happens, driving the correct way down a one-way crescent in Earl's Court, London, recently, I encountered a middleaged cyclist coming straight towards me. Bravely, for you never know what reaction you might get, I wound down my window and, as he passed, gently pointed out that as he was 'a vulnerable road user' and I was a motorist concerned for his safety, did he realise he was heading the wrong way down a one-way street? 'Oh yes, he replied cheerily, but I don't think that applies to bicycles.' A couple of days later, I took avoiding action to give a wide berth to a female cyclist wobbling down the road with a mobile phone clamped to her ear, clearly oblivious to other road users. Go figure, as the Americans say. A new £1 billion centre for research into the cars of the future has been opened by Business Secretary Vince Cable at one of Britain's top universities. The Government and the car industry are investing £500 million each over the next decade into the Advanced Propulsion Centre (APC) at Warwick University. Mr Cable announced a further £32 million for two new projects to research manufacturing technology for electric motors and to develop cleaner internal combustion engines, saying: 'Green technology will drive the cars of the future and UK designers and manufacturers must continue to be leading innovators in this field.' He said the new centre will be 'the hub for projects as diverse as using motorsport braking systems in buses, and streamlining the production of electric motors'. With Ford's best-selling Fiesta leading the way, new car sales accelerated ahead last month . With Ford's best-selling Fiesta leading the way, new car sales accelerated ahead last month with the total for 2014 now well on course to reach a ten-year high. There were 179,714 new registrations last month — 14.2 per cent up on October last year, says industry body the SMMT. Year-to-date sales are up 9.5 per cent over the first ten months of 2013.

"It might look like a bizarre toy car with stablisers, but the Elio could soon be taking over roads across the US. The three-wheeled $6,800 (£4,075) vehicle seats two passengers and goes 0 to 60 mph in 9.6 seconds. It is the same length as a Honda Fit, but half the weight at 1,250lbs (570kg), allowing it to do 84 miles to the gallon. Scroll down for videos . The three-wheeled $6,800 (£4,075) vehicle (pictured) seats two passengers and goes 0 to 60 mph in 9.6 seconds. Phoenix-based Elio Motors plans to start making the vehicles for the US market next autumn . Phoenix-based Elio Motors is now planning to unleash the car on the US market next year, claiming it is the ideal vehicle for commuters. The company plans to start making the cars next autumn at a former General Motors plant in Shreveport, Louisiana. More than 27,000 people have reserved a model, and the firm hopes to make 250,000 cars a year by 2016. That's close to the number Mazda sells in the US. Because it has three wheels - two in front and one in the rear - the Elio is classified as a motorcycle by the US government. But Elio Motors founder Paul Elio said the vehicle has all the safety features of a car, such as an anti-lock brakes, front and side air bags and a steel cage that surrounds the occupants. More than 27,000 people have reserved one , nd Elio hopes to make 250,000 cars a year by 2016.  Because it has three wheels - two in front and one in the rear - Elio is classified as a motorcycle by the US government . Elio Motors founder Paul Elio said the vehicle has all the safety features of a car, such as an anti-lock brakes and a steel cage that surrounds the occupants. Drivers won't be required to have motorcycle licenses . What is it? Because it has three wheels, the Elio is classified as a motorcycle by the US government. How many people does it fit? Two. It has a driver's seat and a passenger seat directly behind that. There is only one door, on the left-hand side. How much power does it have? Elio Motors said the vehicle can go 100 mph (160 km/h) more with its 55-horsepower engine. It goes from 0-60 mph in 9.6 seconds. What is the fuel economy? Elio Motors estimates the Elio will get 84 miles per gallon on the motorway, and 49 mpg in the city. How much is it? The Elio starts at $6,800 (£4,075) Where will it be sold and serviced? Elio Motors plans to set up stores in 60 US markets. It has an agreement with Pep Boys, the auto repair chain, to service the cars. Where will it be built? The company plans to make the vehicles at a former General Motors plant in Shreveport, Louisiana, starting in autumn next year. However, drivers won't be required to wear helmets or have motorcycle licenses. The Elio's two seats sit front and back instead of side-by-side, so the driver is positioned in the centre with the passenger directly behind. That arrangement, plus the low seating position - the Elio is just 4.5ft (54 inches) tall - and the lack of power steering, are said to take a little getting used to. But test drivers claim it feels just like any other small car. That's partly because its two front wheels stick out by a foot on both sides, aiding balance and preventing the vehicle from tipping. The Elio has a three-cylinder, 0.9-litre engine and a top speed of more than 100 mph (160 km/h). It gets an estimated 84 mpg on the highway, and 49 mpg in city driving. Elio keeps the costs down in several ways. The car only has one door, on the left side, which shaves a few hundred pounds off the manufacturing costs, claims the firm. It mixes the compact size of the Smart car with the stability and manoeuverability of the Can-Am Spyder cycle. It will be offered in two configurations - with a manual or automatic transmission - and it has standard air conditioning, power windows and door locks and an AM/FM radio. Germany's Daimler also promised to revolutionise American commutes with the Smart car, but that hasn't panned out, claims Karl Brauer, a senior analyst with Kelley Blue Book. Smart sold just 9,264 cars in the US last year. The Smart has a starting price of $13,270 (£7,900) for a gas-powered car and gets 38 mpg on the motorway- not enough savings or fuel economy to justify sacrificing comfort in the tiny car. The Elio has a 3-cylinder, 0.9-litre engine and a top speed of more than 100 mph (160 km/h). It gets an estimated 84 mpg on the highway and 49 mpg in city driving. It will be offered in manual or automatic transmission . The Elio mixes the size of . the Smart car with the stability and maneuverability of the Can-Am . Spyder cycle (left) But, Mr Brauer said, the equation might work in the Elio. 'If it really gets 84 mpg and doesn't drive terribly, it would justify the compromises you're making in size and comfort,' he said. Elio will also save money by selling the cars directly through its own retailers and not through franchised dealers, similar to electric car maker Tesla Motors. Mr Elio, a one-time stockbroker and New York City cab driver, said he dreamed as a kid that he would one day own a car company called Elio Motors. 'As I matured I decided that was as likely as playing in the NFL,' Elio told The Associated Press. But he did earn an engineering degree at General Motors Institute - now Kettering University - and started his own company engineering products like children's car seats. Mr Elio said so far, reservation holders are older, more affluent buyers who will use the Elio as a second or third car for commuting. 'It's an `and' purchase for a lot of folks,' he said. 'So keep your SUV or your minivan or your large sedan, and when you're driving back and forth to work all by yourself, take the Elio' Eventually, though, he believes the car will appeal to students as well as used-car drivers who want something newer and more reliable. He also hopes to eventually export it to other countries.

"Join Sportsmail's Hands Off In The Box campaign by parading the logo at matches... you could also win an England shirt signed by Jamie Redknapp, Jamie Carragher and Martin Keown by tweeting your support . Former Bolton Wanderers striker Kevin Davies accepts he was no shrinking violet but says that referees have gone too long without punishing the 'dark arts' used by defenders inside the penalty area to stop strikers at free-kicks and corners. Now 37 and still playing for League One Preston North End, Davies reveals he received a litany of black eyes, sore ribs, stamped-on toes and even scratch-marks down the neck during a career in which he has been regularly blocked off by as many as three defenders at a time at set-pieces. He thinks if the laws of the game had been applied correctly, he would have won at least an extra 50 penalties during his eventful career. Davies admits he is torn by the issue of penalty-area grappling. On the one hand, he thinks the physicality of English football is what makes it special; on the other, he realises it is getting to the stage now where honest forwards like himself face an impossible job without more protection from officials, and campaigns like Sportsmail's 'Hands Off In The Box'.

Davies (left) battles for the ball with Gavin McCann of Aston Villa, who has his arm wrapped around the striker . Davies (left) is climbed over by Tottenham's Ledley King and (right) in a grappling contest with Clint Hill . 'The defender's job is to stop you scoring and they will cross the boundaries if allowed to. There is a dark art to how they do it,' says Davies, who regularly topped the Premier League charts for both fouls earned and fouls conceded. Chelsea defender Gary Cahill has become the first defender to back out campaign . This came after Man City manager Manuel Pellegrini also voiced his support . 'I've lost count the number of times I've had one defender in front of me, another one behind, and a third one at the side, using his elbows. Some of them don't even have any intention of going for the ball – their only purpose is to stop you getting a couple of yards for a run on goal. It shouldn't be allowed when the defender is holding you and not even looking at the ball. 'I was always having my shirt pulled. People have their opinion on me but if I am holding my ground and people are all over me, it is still a foul even if I refuse to go down. It would be given as a foul on the halfway line so it should be the same in the penalty area. 'I'd probably be able to find at least 50 occasions where I deserved a penalty but didn't get one. I've spoken to (former referee) Mark Halsey about it, I understand now officials don't want to give penalties unless they are 100 per cent sure because if they get one wrong, they might not be given a game the following week.'

It's something he has never done but given the treatment dished out, he can see why with increasingly underhand tactics from markers, it is considered an option by others. 'The most frustrating thing is I never tried to buy a foul or con the referee. I was too proud to go down if I felt the contact, it'd be my mission to fight back even when they wrestled me,' he explains. 'And the irony is now that I am towards the end of my career and looking to go into coaching or management, I would want one of those defenders in my team, who would do anything to stop a goal.' Centre-forward Davies played for seven clubs but was best known for his decade at Bolton between 2003 and 2013, particularly under Sam Allardyce when he epitomised the club's spirit. He took no prisoners on the football pitch but was equally sinned against by ruthless defenders. 'I wasn't one to complain but I know Sam (Allardyce) sent a dossier to the referees' body after one particular match to highlight the treatment I was getting. He included a picture of me with scratch-marks all down my neck. 'A lot of it's about the way defenders have been brought up. If they have had an old-school defender running their youth team, it will be ingrained in them to stick tight and not give anyone an inch. 'Ryan Shawcross has been highlighted recently but it is a difficult habit to get out of for a defender. It is like they can't stop themselves. From a corner, you are assigned a man and it's your job to stop them any way possible. Ryan Shawcross of Stoke was rightly penalised for wrestling Swansea striker Wilfried Bony to the ground .

Branislav Ivanovic wrestles with Chris Smalling while John Terry grapples Marcos Rojo (left) Referees are being urged to clamp down on the dark arts used in the penalty area after Sportsmail launched our Hands Off In The Box campaign on Monday. 'There might be 18 or 20 players in the box all jostling. It is tough for referees but I guess if they do start giving penalties against defenders, it will stamp it out.' Teams like Arsene Wenger's Arsenal hated to play against Bolton when Allardyce was in charge. Davies was also the subject of rough treatment but he preferred to fight his own battles rather than complain. The one exception led to him getting in hot water after a fall-out with referee Mark Clattenburg after having a goal disallowed for Bolton against Fulham. 'We were fighting relegation and I scored in the last minute which would have taken us up several places in the table. But Mark Clattenburg disallowed it because Brede Hangeland fell over as I challenged him – and that after been genuinely kicked about during the game without going down!' he recalled.

'I was angry and said so because Mark Clattenburg seemed to book me in every game – I received a suspended ban for letting my feelings known.' Davies fears enforcing a 'Hands Off In The Box' campaign won't be as simple as it sounds, however. 'I remember Hermann Hreidarsson being sent off for Charlton after elbowing me in the face (Davies fractures his cheekbone). Later in the game, I want up Amdy Faye, I barely touched him but he screamed and I was sent off to even things up. 'That is the danger for referees, that in their attempt to clean things up in the penalty area, they don't just try to even things up for the sake of it.'","Striker says more must be done to stop the 'dark arts' of defending .

"Two young movie fans have put their own spin on this year's nominees for Best Picture at the Academy Awards, recreating the most iconic scenes from each big screen hit in their own unique way. With direction from their movie-loving mother Maggie Storino, four-year-old Sophia and her three-year-old sister Sadie re-enacted scenes from all eight Best Picture nominees, including Birdman, Boyhood and The Imitation Game, for their photo-based blog, which is aptly-named Don't Call Me Oscar. It is the fourth year in a row that the girls have paid tribute to the iconic Oscars ceremony in this way, with Sophia having first starred on the blog when she was just four months old.

The passing of time: Boyhood, which stars Ellar Coltrane (pictured), Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette, is a coming-of-age drama . 'We are still surprised at how much people like the photos,' Chicago-based Maggie told Today.com. 'Now, my favorite part is looking back at the archive.

It's an amazing way to watch our family grow and to document some of our fondest memories.' While the girls are far too young to have seen any of the nominated movies themselves, both have formed strong opinions about which ones they favor - based purely on their experiences of acting out one pivotal scene from each. Sadie opted for Birdman, which stars Michael Keaton and Edward Norton, with her mother admitting that the youngster even spent time rehearsing her part in the picture, while Sophia picked emotional drama Whiplash, which stars JK Simmons and Miles Teller in the lead roles.

True love: Sophia (L) and Sadie (R) had a chance to play with some fun costumes in order to recreate this scene from the Theory of Everything . Wedding day: Eddie Redmayne (L) and Felicity Jones (R) both received individual nods for their performances in the biopic, which is based on the life of scientist Stephen Hawking . Despite not being able to watch any of the films that they were acting out, Maggie gave her children a brief synopsis of each one after Sophia asked to understand more about the scenes that they would be starring in. And in addition to the background research, the family spent weeks preparing the scenery for each image, with Maggie admitting that the background for The Grand Budapest Hotel, which features dozens of pink packages, took the longest to perfect. 'After a week of glue sticks, scissors and construction paper, they were so looking forward to taking the picture, it felt like Christmas,' she added. Both girls have clearly come a long way since their efforts last year; following the completion of their photos for 2014's nominees, Maggie revealed that working with such young stars had its difficulties, particularly when the girls were left to their own devices. 'We set [the scenery] up when the girls are asleep and then put Sophia in the middle of the picture when she wakes up in the morning,' she explained at the time. Play things: In place of men, Sophia is facing some of her favorite toys on this recreation of the poster for historical drama Selma . Paying her respects: Despite her young age, Sophia still manages to capture the incredible emotion within this poignant image from American Sniper . Impressive performance: Bradley Cooper is also nominated for Best Actor at this year's ceremony . Feel the rhythm: The youngster shows off her most dramatic pose in this re-enactment of a scene from Whiplash - which was Sophia's favorite poster to recreate . Top notch: JK Simmons (pictured) has been commended for his impressive performance in the drama, which also stars Miles Teller . 'With toddlers, if you don't get the photo on the first take it won't work - they eat the props, they play with the dolls, they run amok in a spacesuit.' The Storino family's photo project first began as a light-hearted attempt to make Maggie's sister - a journalist who was covering the Oscars in 2011 - laugh. But after posting them online, Maggie says she was taken aback by the positive reaction the fun images received. 'My sister is a journalist, working on Oscars coverage and we took the photos to make her laugh. And it worked. 'Our friends and family liked the photos so much they suggested we post it online. 'I was nervous about putting my kids on the internet. We are absolutely shocked to see how many people really seem to enjoy the photos.'","It is the fourth year in a row that four-year-old Sophia and her three-year-old sister Sadie have starred in the photo series .

"Sales of ear plugs may well rocket as a result of one poor Australian’s ordeal with a cockroach. Hendrik Helmer, from Darwin, revealed that he was recently forced to seek help from a doctor after a cockroach burrowed into his right ear while he was asleep – and refused to come out. It even defied Mr Helmer’s vacuum cleaner. Disturbing: The cockroach burrowed into Mr Helmer's ear while he slept (file picture) The situation sucked: The cockroach even resisted Mr Helmer's vacuum cleaner (file picture) Mr Helmer was alerted to the presence of the unwanted tenant by a sharp pain in his ear, which woke him up. He told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that his initial worry was that a poisonous spider – of which there are many down under – had burrowed its way into his ear canal. The pain rapidly got worse so Mr Helmer tried to suck out the critter with a vacuum cleaner. When that failed to work his flatmate decided that it would be best to seek medical help. The doctor’s initial strategy, thinking the insect was small, was to put olive oil down the ear, but that only made matters worse. The cockroach simply burrowed further in. Mr Helmer said: ‘Near the 10 minute mark ... somewhere about there, he started to stop burrowing but he was still in the throes of death twitching.’ The doctor eventually pulled the cockroach out with forceps and its size astonished them both - it was an inch long. Mr Helmer told ABC: ‘She (the doctor) said, “You know how I said a little cockroach, that may have been an underestimate.” ‘They said they had never pulled an insect this large out of someone's ear.’ While Mr Helmer hasn’t changed his nightime routine, his friends have apparently taken to wearing headphones in bed.","Mr Hendrik Helmer from Darwin, Australia, woke up with pain in his right ear .

"Just this morning, the Queen attended the Opening of Parliament dressed in her full State finery. The Imperial State Crown was perched on her perfect candyfloss curls and her diminutive figure was shrouded in the impressive 18ft fur-trimmed Robe Of State. Hours later though, the monarch cut a very different figure as she hunkered down under a headscarf (Hermes, naturally) and navy raincoat against the grim British weather. At times, as the rain drizzled down and the corners of her headscarf blew about in the breeze, the monarch's mouth was set in a grim line. But appearances can be deceiving and the Queen, attending the first day of the Windsor Horse Show, would likely have been in her element. What a difference! Left, the Queen this afternoon at the Windsor Horse Show, and right, wearing the George IV State Diadem, her Angela Kelly crystal-studded dress and and an ermine stole at Parliament today . Quick change: Left, the Queen in wool skirt and warm outerwear in the grounds of Windsor castle and right, hours earlier in her silk Angela Kelly dress, carrying a bespoke Launer handbag wearing Queen Victoria's diamonds and pearls . In her element: Despite the odd grimace, the Queen looked overjoyed to be at the horse show, where she would have been able to watch jump competitions and inspect thoroughbreds . The Horse Show, held in the grounds of Windsor Castle, is known to be one of the monarch's favourite events of the spring/summer calender. An occasion for serious equestrians, the Queen would have today taken in a jumping competition and a display of part bred and Arab horses among other events. Quite the departure from the pomp and ceremony from earlier in the day where with a 15 minute speech the Queen unveiled 20 new Bills the coalition will pass into law over the coming year. With that out of the way - and the 2.3lb weight of the crown jewels and 15lb state robe changed for her 'civvies' - the Queen must have felt like a weight had been lifted from her shoulders - literally. Her crystal-encrusted white silk gown - the same one she wore for her Jubilee portrait last summer - had been hung safely away. Instead, the Queen wore a sensible blue wool skirt along with her navy coat. One is not (very) amused: The queen stifles a laugh as her companion makes a joke . Looks like rain... The afternoon proved to be mixed, with grey clouds and drizzle taking place of the bright sunshine of earlier in the week . It was announced this week that the Queen would be scaling back her public duties - primarily cutting back on longhaul flights - a forthcoming Royal engagement in Sri Lanka will be carried out by Prince Charles instead of the Queen. Indeed, Charles attended the State Opening for the first time in 17 years, and was accompanied for the first time by Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall in a clear sign that the heir to the throne is stepping up his royal duties. But today, at the ripe old age of 87, the Queen proved she still has more than enough energy to put on an impeccable show - both with the pomp and ceremony of the State occasion, and getting stuck in among the crowds in the field. No prizes for guessing which event she enjoyed the most. EARLIER THAT DAY... The Queen attended the State Opening of Parliament wearing the Robe of the State, the Imperial Crown, a white dress and gloves, and Queen Victoria's pearl earrings and Jubilee necklace . It has been announce that Prince Charles - attending the ceremony for the first time in 17 years, and for the first time with his wife Camilla Duchess of Cornwall - will take on a bigger role as 'co-head' of the Royal family . Queen Elizabeth wore pearl drop earrings that were given to Queen Victoria by her husband Prince Albert . The necklace worn by the Queen was gifted to Queen Victoria to mark her Golden Jubilee .

"A spectator ran on to the pitch and hit Franck Ribery with a scarf in stoppage time of Bayern Munich's 3-1 victory at Hamburg in the second round of the German Cup on Wednesday. The man ran the width of the field before hitting the former France forward, who had secured victory for the cup holders. The intruder was caught by guards and escorted from the pitch. 'Fortunately, nothing much happened,' a relaxed and smiling Ribery told German television after the match. 'It was a difficult situation, I didn't see him coming.' VIDEO Scroll down to watch Guardiola happy as Bayern better Hamburg . Security staff grab a Hamburg supporter who has struck Franck Ribery with his scarf in injury time . The supporter swore at Ribery, who after the match dismissed the incident and focused on the match . Ribery had been booed by Hamburg fans every time he touched the ball. Bayern took advantage of a dreadful Hamburg mistake and a poor refereeing decision to take a two-goal lead through Robert Lewandowski and David Alaba before Ribery scored with a deflected shot in the second half. Pierre-Michel Lasogga scored a late consolation for the hosts. For Bayern's first, Thomas Muller anticipated a horrible back pass from Heiko Westermann, picked up the ball and fed Lewandowski, whose first effort was cleared off the line by Johan Djourou. But the ball fell for the Poland striker, who drilled it inside the post in the seventh minute. Thomas Muller shouts at the fan, while the referee attempts to keep the Bayern forward away . Robert Lewandowski celebrates Bayern's first goal of the night against Hamburg . David Alaba scored Bayern's second, on their way to a 3-1 victory away at Hamburg in the German Cup . Muller netted himself later but had the strike disallowed for offside before Alaba doubled the lead shortly before halftime. Bayern were given a throw-in although the ball had bounced off Philipp Lahm. With Hamburg's players still out of position, Xabi Alonso got the ball from the throw-in and fed Alaba, who fired home from nearly 30 meters (yards). Hamburg goalkeeper Jaroslav Drobny got his hands on the shot but couldn't keep it out, and Bayern had a comfortable lead despite creating few chances. Ribery's shot from the edge of the box in the 55th minute deflected off Djourou, wrong-footing Drobny, and put the match beyond doubt. The keeper made a pair of late saves to keep the score respectable before Lasogga's token effort. 'Our goal is to stay in this competition until the end,' said Bayern captain Lahm, whose team face Borussia Dortmund in the Bundesliga at the weekend.

"America has made significant progress in race relations since the Civil Rights Act was signed 50 years ago, Attorney General Eric Holder said today, but 'our work is not complete.' 'As it stands our society is not yet color blind nor should it be given the disparities that still afflict and divide us,' he said this morning at a Department of Justice event commemorating the signing of the 1964 legislation. 'We must be color brave and must never forget that all our made better and more prosperous if all are given equal opportunities.' 'We must be color brave': Attorney General Eric Holder said today that America has made significant progress since the Civil Rights Act was signed in 1964, but 'too many' Americans still face discrimination in society . 'And we must never hesitate to confront the fact that... in too many places' in America ' the echos of injustices stretching . back nearly four centuries continue to reverberate,' Holder continued. 'These echos from . times past are still heard by too many in our nation today.' The landmark civil rights legislation banned discrimination on the basis of race, sex, and color, but 'too many' women and minorities, as well as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender individuals, still face discrimination, Holder, the nation's first black Attorney General, told attendees of today's ceremony. And if their problems 'were felt so acutely by the majority of Americans, I believe our national dialogue and the response to these problems could be very different,' he said. Holder called on Congress to 'renew the spirit' of the Civil Right Act by passing Democrats' equal pay for equal work legislation and making reforms to fair housing and lending laws that allow for discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity and marital status. Furthermore, Congress should pass legislation that guarantees non-discriminatory learning environments for LGBT individuals and make updates to to the Voting Rights Act, he said. ‘As a people we have never been content to tie ourselves to an unjust . status quo' no matter how many other people in society are 'content' to do so, he said in encouraging Congress to pass his suggested reforms. The Justice Department official touted his own department's efforts to prevent Republican-backed voter identification laws 'leveled under the dubious guise of voter fraud prevention' from taking effect. Holder and other Democrats claim the laws are unfair to young people, the elderly and minorities, and violate voting rights. The Obama administration has made 'sweeping' changes to ensure that all Americans receive equal protection under the law, Holder said, but the government can't end discrimination in America all on it's own. Americans must take it upon themselves to stop discriminatory behavior. As a society, ‘we must be willing to acknowledge the problems that we face and to talk frankly about inequality,' he said, if we are to 'ultimately eradicate it.' 'And we must look at our great nation and reflect on its history with . clarity and with painful honesty, with open eyes and deep understanding . of who we have been, who we aspire to be and who we are today.' President Lyndon B. Johnson shakes the hand of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. at the July 2, 1964 signing of the Civil Rights Act. Government officials memorialized for the signing of the bill today in Washington, D.C. at historically black college Howard University . The Justice Department held today's even memorializing the July 2, 1964 legislation in tandem with historically black college Howard University, which is located a few miles up the road from the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. Education Secretary Arne Duncan and Labor Secretary Thomas Perez also gave remarks in addition to other Justice officials and Howard University representatives. Holder, who gave the keynote address today, has been the Obama administration's official spokesman on racial issues throughout the last five and a half years, often saying what President Barack Obama - who did not speak at the event - is unwilling or unable to say for political reasons. In a 2009 speech, Holder ruffled feathers by saying that  'in . things racial,' Americans 'have always been and continue to be, in too . many ways, essentially a nation of cowards.' Holder stood by his remarks in an interview over the weekend, telling ABC News' Pierre Thomas, 'I . think we are still a nation that is too afraid to confront racial . issues and to engage 'one another across the color line [to] . talk about racial issues.' In the interview, Holder previewed his remarks today, saying the country has 'made a great deal of progress' since the Civil Rights Act was passed, 'but . there's still more we have to travel along this road so we get to the . place that is consistent with our founding ideals.'","Attorney General Eric Holder was the keynote speaker today at a Justice Department event commemorating the signing of the Civil Rights Act .

Attendance was not considered compulsory but his absence was noted, particularly when all the other squad members chose to come down from their hotel rooms and watch Real Madrid run out 3-1 winners against arch rivals Barcelona. United declined to comment when contacted by Sportsmail on Tuesday morning. Van Gaal added: 'It was the quality of the game - Real Madrid vs Barcelona.

"They fill their monthly magazine pages with glossy photographs of glamorous models wearing expensive clothes, and inform us how we should be dressing each season. But when it comes to dressing themselves, it would appear that some of the world's loftiest fashion editors do so in the dark. Or at least after a couple of Grey Goose martinis.

"For more facts and stats from White Hart Lane, click here for our Match Zone . Jurgen Klinsmann watched this shambles play out from a comfy, cushioned seat in the directors' box at White Hart Lane. The temptation at half-time, when his beloved Tottenham trooped off 2-0 down to a chorus of boos, was to ask him to take charge after the break. Let’s face it, why wait? These days Klinsmann, who turned down the Spurs job last year in the build up to the World Cup, is head coach of the USA soccer team. The Americans, playing catch-up on Tottenham’s 132-year history, get the game better than the group of players allotted to Mauricio Pochettino. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch .

Ratings by NEIL ASHTON at White Hart Lane . There will be another inquest up at the training ground on Monday after Pochettino’s team slumped to their four defeat in five home matches in the Barclays Premier League. Stoke were streets ahead of them: slick, organised, disciplined and focused. All the things Tottenham want to be but never will be. Doesn’t it hurt to be booed off at half-time? Isn’t it humiliating to be dragged off, as Christian Eriksen and Andros Townsend were, after just 45 minutes? ‘Tactical reasons,’ claimed Pochettino. Code for dreadful. It is unbearable. Stoke were rampant in the first half, taking the lead through the wriggling figure of Bojan Krkic and doubling it when Jonathan Walters scored with a simple tap in. Nice, easy money. Bar Nacer Chadli’s glorious strike, a volley at the back stick 12 minutes from time, this was dreadful. There is no patter to Tottenham’s play. We were promised one of the best coaches in world football, one of the most innovative in the Premier League when Pochettino was head-hunted from Southampton. He doesn’t have the answers. To watch Emmanuel Adebayor delay his arrival as a substitute when his team were 2-0 down by electing to changing his boots makes you feel sick. That is what the half-hour warm up is for and the weather conditions hadn’t changed. Instead, the storm clouds are gathering here again. When they were chasing the game seven minutes from time, their dopey right back Kyle Naughton was dismissed for a foolish nudge on Victor Moses. So, to Stoke, then, and this glitzy performance., . Bojan’s first goal in English football was a good ‘un, ghosting - make that coasting - past Tottenham’s non-existent defence to lash the opener beyond Hugo Lloris. Can Bojan, once tipped to be even better that Lionel Messi during his spell at Barcelona, do it on a wet, windy night in Stoke? That’s not so clear cut, but what we do know is that the little Spanish forward found White Hart Lane to his liking. The beauty of playing Tottenham is that you always know they will give you a chance sooner or later. They obliged, of course they did.

Steve Sidwell             90           11.8      6.7 . Even when Stoke were forced into a defensive reshuffle, they were untroubled throughout a first half dominated by Hughes’ side. Phil Bardsley succumbed to injury after nine minutes and was replaced by Geoff Cameron. Marc Wilson was substituted for Marc Muniesa after 26. Moments later, Stoke scored again. This defence needs sorting out because the goal Walters scored was too easy. Mame Diouf bounced through unchallenged, into the danger zone and placed the ball into the path of Walters for the Stoke forward to finish off the job. By this time it was borderline embarrassing. Apart from the scoreline, Spurs’ contribution to the first half was a long range effort from Ryan Mason that hit the side-netting. Seriously, that was it. There are rumblings of discontent around these parts and it is becoming increasingly difficult to protect Pochettino. His team, who fluked a win at Aston Villa last weekend after Christian Benteke was dismissed, were hopelessly under-prepared for Stoke. Even Harry Kane - ‘he is one of us’ as they sing - couldn’t get going, try as he might. Sadly for Kane, Stoke’s giant of a centre half Ryan Shawcross handled him impeccably. The kid hardly got a kick. They hardly had a shot either, barely registering an effort after a half-time team talk that excluded Eriksen and Townsend.

Erik Lamela’s free-kick 15 minutes from time brought a flying save from Begovic, launching himself to the left to turn it around the post. Chadli gave them hope when he picked the ball out of the air to beat the keeper with an angled volley, but the dismissal of Naughton confirmed the worst. Adebayor wasted a chance when he head wide of Begovic’s post and Kane’s desperate attempts to repeat his last minute free-kick against Villa last week was drilled straight at the wall.

A boyfriend became so jealous of his girlfriend's love for her hamster that he threw the pet out of her home. Andrew Walsh, 30, became resentful of the emotional bond between the rodent and Julie Hanson when she broke up with him. To get back at her he broke into her home in Blackpool, Lancashire, while she was out playing bingo with her mother magistrates were told. He then released Harry the hamster from his cage. Walsh broke her front down, opened the door to Harry's cage and then fled with a TV. When Miss Hanson returned the following day she discovered the burglary and that Harry was missing. Tracy Yates, prosecuting at Blackpool Magistrates' Court, said: 'Walsh had repeatedly asked Julie Hanson to re-kindle their relationship.' 'When he saw her at bingo she told him she was to stay at her mum’s that night.' 'The next day she found her front door broken in and the door to her hamster’s cage was open. 'The hamster was missing and it is the Crown’s case that Walsh was very much aware that she loved the hamster and had a string emotional tie to the animal which Walsh did not like.' 'She was very upset.' Revenge: The court heard that Wash resented the emotional bond his ex-girlfriend shared with her beloved pet hamster. (File photo) 'When Walsh was arrested he told police he had opened the cage door to give Harry his freedom.' Robert Castle, defending, said: 'I am delighted to say the hamster has now been found. He was hiding under a rug and is safe and well.' Walsh admitted burglary and was ordered to do 150 hours unpaid work, pay £85 costs and £60 victims' surcharge.","Andrew Walsh broke into his ex's home and released her beloved pet .

"A 'secret' Facebook group has emerged which shows trainee police officers blacked up, wearing Nazi uniforms and posing for pictures surrounded by women in stockings and suspenders. In posts on the page, former students at the Ashford Training Centre, in Kent, have also left sexist and homophobic jokes. Underneath a picture 'of the class of 1984' which shows two trainees with Swastikas and a third person blacked up, one group member has written: 'Cracking pic for the Daily Mail!'. 'Sure you asked everyone if you wanted them on the internet with a Nazi flag?' The picture is understood to have been taken after a jokey end of course sketch. Scroll down for video .

Comments: A user wrote underneath the picture that trainee police officers would not be able to get away with the same things now. There is no reason to suspect anyone posting on the page was involved in the 1984 end of course sketch . Irony: A Facebook user suggests that the picture, which appears to show a police officer blacking up, would make a good news story. There is no reason to suspect anyone posting on the page was involved in the 1984 end of course sketch . Deputy Chief Constable Paul Brandon of Kent Police said: ‘Standards of behaviour have improved significantly in the last 30 years. What was acceptable as shown in an end of course sketch in 1984, would not now be appropriate behaviour by police officers.’ Despite . the offensive comments on the Facebook page, a spokesman for Kent . Police said they are not investigating at all. The pictures . came to light today after a disgusted retired police officer handed the . photos to Kerry-Anne Mendoza at the current affairs website iacknowledge. The Facebook group 'I Survived Ashford Police Training Centre' was initially set up for new recruits who attended the centre between 1973 and 2006. As well as sharing controversial images and jokes, many of the 2,000 members were using it 'almost like a confessional' to boast about inappropriate behaviour and even occasions where they knowingly broke the law. Many of the posts on the page are harmless and are filled with people reminiscing about their time at the training centre. However, because of the more extreme content the group was made secret last month so no-one can see it unless they are invited to join. The administrator wrote on the page: 'It doesn't bear thinking about if some of the stories and photos got in the wrong hands. The media could have a whale of a time.'

There is no suggestion that any of the people who have posted on this page are involved in any wrongdoing . 'Confessions': Former users reminisce about their time at the Ashford Police Training Centre. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing - and many of the posts on the group are harmless . One posting appears to suggest that . part of the training at Ashford was showing potential officers how to . take suspects 'down an alley and sort 'em out'. Other . posts revealed apparent bigoted . behaviour among the trainees, with one officer who claims to have been . recruited in 1995 responding to a message about popular senior figures . by saying his own sergeant: 'certainly wasn't the shaved-headed . ginger-haired Sgt from Sussex that eventually got the sack for . inappropriate gayness!!!' The former officer went on to say that the page shows the training centre was a 'drink fest and a sh*g fest'. She added: 'It's very much a culture of what happens at Ashford stays at Ashford'. Other people who said they were former trainees claimed they had stolen beer from the training centre's bar, removed signs from doors and thrown bangers off the roof. Another officer bragged about driving panda cars to the top of a steep hill, then letting them roll back down without brakes to see how fast they would go. The Ashford Police Training Centre closed in 2006 after training officers for the British Transport Police and Buckinghamshire, Cambridgeshire, City of London, Essex, Guernsey, Hampshire, Hertfordshire, Jersey, Kent, Norfolk, Surrey, Sussex and Thames Valley police forces, as well as the Royal Parks Constabulary from 1973. Recruits: A typical passing out parade at the Ashford Police Training Centre in the 1980s. None of the officers in this photograph have been linked to any wrongdoing . A spokesman for the College of Policing, which was set up in 2012 to set standards in policing, said they had no way of knowing if people who have posted on the Facebook page were still serving police officers. He added that many of the pictures appear to have been taken decades ago. 'As the new professional body for policing, we set standards for the service and the behaviour shown does not reflect what we would expect in modern-day policing,' the spokesman said. 'We encourage officers and police staff to use social media as an important tool to engage with communities, gather intelligence and help keep people safe. 'Each person working in the service needs to ensure their online presence meets the standards expected of them.' A spokesman for Kent Police said they are not investigating the group. 'We can confirm that no complaints regarding this matter have been received,' he said. 'Kent Police is not investigating this matter at present. The images appear to be from the late 1970s or 1980s, and there is nothing we can see that constitutes serving officers making inappropriate comments or being involved.'

"LEAVING BEFORE THE RAINS COME . by Alexandra Fuller . (Harvill Secker £16.99) That awful book, was how Alexandra Fuller’s mother, Nicola, always referred to Don’t Let’s Go To The Dogs Tonight, her daughter’s bestselling account of growing up in Africa. But Nicola — whose love of literature was exceeded only by her passion for alcohol — had always encouraged her daughter to write, and she became the heroine of Alexandra’s second memoir, Cocktail Hour Under The Tree Of Forgetfulness. In her latest memoir, Fuller turns her fiercely observant gaze on her own life as a wife and mother, telling the story of the marriage that took her from the perils of Africa to a very different kind of hazard in Wyoming. ‘When I was breaking down my reason for marrying Charlie to other people,’ she writes, ‘I said, “He looked good on a horse . . . ” What I never would have confessed was the truth: at 22, I was already exhausted and what I projected onto Charlie’s broad-shouldered frame was an embellished biography that made him both my sanctuary and my saviour. ‘I believed if I moored myself to Charlie, I would know tranquillity interspersed with organised adventure.’ Fuller’s early childhood was fraught with adventure of the most catastrophic kind. Growing up in a country undergoing the bloody metamorphosis from Rhodesia into Zimbabwe, she and her sister, Vanessa, travelled in an armoured Land Rover and learned to strip and fire a gun. They dressed for dinner each night, and were taught that the greatest sin of all was to be boring. But just below the brittle surface of old-fashioned, upper-class social mores lay chaos and death. Three of Alexandra’s four siblings died young, and the accumulation of tragedy tipped her mother into depression and alcoholism. ‘It takes a kind of outrageous courage . . . to revel in the pattern of that much definite chaos,’ she writes. ‘I had been raised in this way . . . but at some point, I had lost the mettle and the imagination to surrender to the promise of perpetual insecurity.’ Charlie Ross seemed to offer the ideal combination of excitement and security. Eleven years older than Alexandra, he was a dashing adventurer with a degree in international business, who told stories about white water rafting in Siberia and helicopter skiing in Yosemite. Best of all, he seemed unworried by the prospect of meeting her parents. When she warned him that her father would probably wave a shotgun at him, he said: ‘That’s OK. I’ve spent every summer of my life on my grandmother’s ranch in Wyoming and she waves her shotgun at everyone, especially after cocktail hour.’ Six months later, they were engaged. Six months after that, she married him on her parents’ farm. At the wedding, an old, Polish priest told her: ‘The first year is hard and, after that, it gets worse.’ He was right. Almost as soon as the honeymoon was over, the marriage ran into trouble: ‘The first year was hard and, after that . . . it got more and more silent, and silence frightened me more than almost anything else.’ Charlie’s safari business struggled, Alexandra couldn’t find a job and, when their first baby was born, their charming but mosquito-infested cottage on the banks of the Zambezi River proved an impossible place in which to live with a newborn. By the time they decided to leave Africa for America, ‘Charlie’s love for me was waning — I’d been a disappointment, it was obvious . . . but I was still his wife and the mother of his child; there still remained a residue of dutiful love in sickness and in health’. After 15 years, two more children and much couples’ counselling, that residue of dutiful love was exhausted. Charlie’s real estate business was crippled by the 2008 U.S. mortgage crisis, and Alexandra’s attempts to write them out of trouble weren’t enough. By 2011, they were so trapped by debt that when Alexandra asked for a divorce, Charlie told her they couldn’t afford it: everything they owned belonged to the bank. When circumstances are intolerable, something has to give. Five months after their 19th wedding anniversary, Charlie’s horse, Big Boy, fell and rolled on him. He suffered a series of strokes and his life was saved only when Alexandra insisted, against medical advice, that he be moved to a hospital with an expert neurology unit. In the movies, this would be the moment the couple rediscovered their love. But there is no fairytale ending here: ‘You can have an intense connection to someone without being a good, lifelong mate for him. Love is complicated and difficult that way.’ To use your own life as the raw material for a book is an enterprise fraught with hazard. Yet in this hauntingly beautiful memoir, Fuller combines unsparing — and often very funny — self-analysis with an aching tenderness for the family she and Charlie couldn’t keep intact and a deep love of Africa, the beloved country of her childhood where she no longer really belongs.","She tells of the marriage that took her from Africa to  Wyoming .

"While the woman was giving evidence during a criminal court case, her colleagues took her mobile from her coat pocket and sent nude photographs they found on the device to other friends in the force. They then allegedly taunted the 42-year-old victim by sending her pictures of themselves in provocative poses. The embarrassing affair has emerged after two of the sacked police community support officers took legal action, claiming unfair dismissal and arguing they were just enjoying ‘a bit of banter’. 'Misconduct': Former PCSOs Khalid Akhtar (left) and Joy Shoker arrive at an employment tribunal in Birmingham today, to appeal against being sacked . However, Khalid Akhtar, 42, and Joy . Shoker, 24, both from Wolverhampton, yesterday saw their appeal thrown . out by an employment tribunal in Birmingham. The officers, who have ten years of . police experience between them, were sacked on August 23 last year . following accusations of bullying and harassment. As part of the local . Safer Travel police team, the PCSOs had appeared at Dudley Magistrates’ Court in May 2011 to give evidence during a criminal case. It is claimed that while the female . colleague, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was on the stand, . other members of the team found her phone in a coat pocket in a witness . room. They allegedly took the phone, . trawled through photographs and came across nude pictures of the woman, . which they then shared with other officers. Kicked out: The PCSOs were fired from the West Midlands force after the woman claimed they took her phone while she gave evidence in a case at court . They are said to have followed this . up by bombarding her with their own lewd pictures, mocking her by making . provocative gestures at the camera. The woman reported what had happened . to her superiors and an internal police inquiry was launched. A number . of officers had their phones seized and inspected by investigators. Four . PCSOs were dismissed for gross misconduct, but one was reinstated after . an appeal. A fifth PCSO was also suspended but later resigned. Speaking after the hearing, Akhtar, . who had worked for the force for six years, said his life had been left . in ‘tatters’ since he was dismissed. He said: ‘I have been fighting this . every step of the way. I just want justice for myself. ‘I’m devastated. I’ve lost my job and people look down on me because of what they think I have done. I loved my job. ‘She [the victim] was actually one of my best friends. ‘She thought the pictures were making fun of her, but they weren’t.’ Shoker, who worked for  the force for four years, has since secured a job as an administrator. She said: ‘The whole thing has been . blown out of proportion. It was some text messages between a group of . friends. A bit of banter is all.’ Employment tribunal judge Laurie Anstis rejected the claim of unfair dismissal because it was lodged too late. Chris Rowson, head of human resources . at the West Midlands force, said: ‘West Midlands Police expects the . highest standards of professional behaviour from all of its employees . and will thoroughly investigate allegations suggesting that any employee . falls short of these expectations.’","Two are now suing the authority for unfair dismissal and discrimination .

"Our homes could soon be powered by floating generators that double up as mobile phone masts. Massachusetts-based Altaeros Energies has teamed up with the Alaska Energy Authority to power homes across the northwest state using its Buoyant Airborne Turbine (BAT).

Altaeros claims that at these altitudes, winds are between five and eight times stronger than . those harvested by tower turbines. This equates to a 65 per cent saving on energy costs, and reduces installation time from weeks to days. The BAT uses a helium-filled, inflatable shell to lift to high altitudes. High-strength chains hold the BAT steady while also being used to transfer the electricity created back to the ground. The BAT's lifting technology is adapted from aerostats - industrial cousins of the blimp.

The BAT's lifting technology is adapted from aerostats - industrial cousins of the blimp . Altaeros claims at high altitudes, winds are between five and eight times stronger than those harvested by tower turbines . Altaeros Energies has been developing the technology for the past four years and announced in March 2012 it successfully generated energy from 350ft (106m) with an automated prototype of its airborne wind turbine. It lifted a top-selling turbine to produce over twice the power at high altitude than generated at conventional tower height and landed again in an automated cycle. The turbine was successfully transported and deployed into the air at Loring Commerce Center in Limestone, Maine, from a towable docking trailer. The BAT is designed to have 'virtually no environmental or noise impact' and requires minimal maintenance. The company continued that the Altaeros will displace expensive fuel used to power diesel generators at remote industrial, military, and village sites. In the long term, Altaeros plans to scale up the technology to reduce costs in the offshore wind market. ‘For decades, wind turbines have required cranes and huge towers to lift a few hundred feet off the ground where winds can be slow and gusty,’ explained Ben Glass, Altaeros' chief executive officer. ‘We are excited to demonstrate that modern inflatable materials can lift wind turbines into more powerful winds almost everywhere - with a platform that is cost competitive and easy to setup from a shipping container.’ The company hopes the BAT, pictured, will replace expensive fuel used to power diesel generators at remote industrial, military, and village sites .

"Zuckerberg says his friendship with Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, who had received a liver transplant before he died last year, helped spur the idea . Facebook has helped us share everything from wedding photos to our taste in music - now the social network wants to help you share your organs. CEO Mark Zuckerberg says U.S. and U.K. users will be able to enroll as organ donors via links on the world's biggest social networking site. Zuckerberg says his friendship with Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, who had received a liver transplant before he died last year, partly inspired the idea. The Facebook founder announced the organ donor update to the social networking site on U.S. TV show Good Morning America yesterday. Facebook users who are already organ donors can add that information to their Facebook Timelines. Facebook Inc. is busy preparing an initial public stock offering said to be pegged at $5billion. The IPO could place the company's value at $100billion. Facebook update: Robin Roberts, left, host of Good Morning America, talks to Mark Zuckerberg about the new feature . Motivation: Zuckerberg said he was inspired by Steve Jobs' story and wanted to connect people looking for organs and donors . Facebook Timeline information is available even if a user is not signed in - so the data could be accessed easily by medical staff. The father of a six-year-old boy who was on the brink of death before receiving a liver and kidney transplant has called for Facebook users to register their interest in organ donation online. Philip Barton said if users write about their feelings on the subject on the website, it could save the lives of children like his son, Kian. Mr Barton made his comments as the social media giant announced that users could share their thoughts on organ donation using their timelines. After people have expressed their interest, they are encouraged to sign up to the organ donor register on NHS Blood and Transplant's (NHSBT) page on the site. Mr Barton, from Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, said Kian suffered from liver disease and kidney failure from a young age. ‘The only option for him was transplant,’ he said. ‘There was no other choice. It was that or certain death.’ Other technology: Facebook 'Lifestyle Updates' let users post weight-loss goals as well as broken bone stories . His son received a partial liver and kidney transplant from an adult donor in January 2009. Mr Barton added: ‘He is doing really well now - he had such a bad start to life, he was so ill - but now he is in school and it is fantastic to see. ‘People don't realise that there are children waiting for transplants. ‘I think this new venture is brilliant because Facebook has such a large demographic and it is increasing in popularity. We need to get as many people as possible on to the register. ‘Facebook becoming involved in something like this is a massively positive step.’ From today, users on the site can add information about their thoughts on organ donation by clicking on the health and well-being section on their timeline. But they are not on the official register until they sign up. Sally Johnson, NHSBT's director of organ donation and transplantation, hopes it will make more people sign the register. She said it would also make users' family and friends aware of their views on donating their organs after death. Ms Johnson said: ‘We need more people to sign up to the register and share their wishes with their friends and family. Our job is to make that as quick and easy as possible. Previous donor card systems have been unwieldy - signing up via Facebook could massively increase the number of organs available . ‘This is an exciting new way to use the power of social media to reach a huge audience and encourage people to think about it, act and share that information.’ Facebook's UK director of policy Simon Milner said: ‘Small acts of kindness happen every day on Facebook but we hope that our partnership with NHS Blood and Transplant will use the power of friendship to save lives. ‘We hope that as a result of this partnership, UK Facebook users will together be able to reduce the number of people who needlessly die waiting for an organ each year.’ At the moment, around 10,000 people need a transplant in the UK and three people die every day while on the waiting list.","Could massively increase the number of organs available to patients .

"Vice President Joe Biden wants everyone to know that he has high hopes for the 'nation' of Africa. Biden isn't just a walking gaffe machine – he's a walking gaffe top-ten list. So when he goofed at Tuesday's U.S.-Africa Business Forum, and there was no F-bomb involved, it didn't make headlines. But gaffe he did, in front of 50 world leaders and their entourages at the event held on the sidelines of President Barack Obama's U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Gaffe #4,281: US Vice President Joe Biden told the US-Africa Business Forum on Tuesday that the 'nation' of Africa should be among the world's great economic powers . Africa is a continent made up of 54 separate countries, including island nations off its coastlines. 'If Africa's governance and institutions can put its people in a position commensurate with their possibilities, the sky is the limit,' the veep said Tuesday. 'I mean, it is limitless' ​'There's no reason the nation of Africa cannot and should not join the ranks of the world's most prosperous nations in the near term, in the decades ahead. There is simply no reason.' The skinny-dipping, party guest-groping bumbler who's one heartbeat away from the presidency once chaired the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.

He met Tuesday with South African President Jacob Zuma, Tunisian President Moncef Marzouki and Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan on the margins of the event. He will also attend a dinner tonight at the White House honoring all the African leaders. The event will also include several non-political luminaries. The Obama administration said in a statement on Tuesday that guests will include Essence magazine Editor-in-Chief Vanessa Bush, 'Orange is the New Black' star Uzo Aduba, '12 Years a Slave' actor Chiwetel Ejiofor, NASCAR driver Jeff Gordon, Olympic marathoner Meb Keflezighi, sculptor Wangechi Mutu, Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr., and actor Robert DeNiro and his wife Grace.

Biden, a White House source said Tuesday, is not expected to speak at the glitzy event. That may be just as well. Everybody loves Joe: The veep got a laugh out of White House budget director Shaun Donovan during his ceremonial swearing-in ceremony on Tuesday . It was just four years ago that he noted in a diplomatic face-palm moment how Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen's mother had 'lived in Long Island for ten years or so' before her death. 'God rest her soul,' Biden said somberly, before realizing that  'wait – your mom’s still ... your mom’s still alive. Your dad passed. God bless her soul.' In 2012 he made the sign of the cross while on stage to address a group of more than 1,600 conservative rabbis in Atlanta. Reporters guffawed later that year when he tried to capture the spirit of President Theodore Roosevelt's famous 'Speak softly' philosophy, by noting that 'the president has a big stick. I promise you.' It brought back memories of a 2008 photo-op outside Biden's home where he told journalists that he had just returned from 'a successful dump,' which turned out to be a trip to a nearby landfill. Two months later during an Ohio campaign speech, Biden criticized then-GOP presidential candidate Sen. John McCain for what he called a 'last-minute economic plan' that did 'nothing to tackle the number-one job facing the middle class.' 'It happens to be, as Barack says, a three-letter word: jobs. J-O-B-S, jobs.' Several of Biden's most cringe-worthy moments have riled conservatives who say their own political stars would have been pilloried in print and on television if they had made similar comments. 'You cannot go to a 7-11 or a Dunkin' Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent,' he told an Indian-American man in 2006, with a C-SPAN camera rolling. 'I'm not joking.'","American VP addressed 50 world leaders – all from Africa – on Tuesday .

"The sister of a rising rugby star killed with his father and brother in a slurry tank accident has been released from hospital.

Slurry pits emit poisonous gases such as hydrogen sulphide and ammonia, so can be dangerous if not ventilated properly.

Irish Rugby Union Players’ Association Awards last year, Nevin was a . member of the Ulster Rugby squad that reached the European Heineken Cup . final last season. He could play on the wing or as a centre and was considered a future Ireland international. The committed Christian played for Ulster Ravens, Ulster’s second team, against Munster A on Friday. He had represented Ireland at under-20 . level and was called to the Ireland training squad for the Six Nations . last year. In May he was selected for the Ireland squad ahead of a match . against the Barbarians, a touring team made up of top players from . across the world.

"One fan put the angst of Manchester City's crumbling Champions League campaign to the back of his mind at the Etihad on Wednesday night as he made himself a sandwich in the stands. Amazingly the supporter took out a whole loaf of bread and a jar of peanut butter and was pictured making the 'sarnie' in his front-row seat at arguably City's biggest match of the season. Manuel Pellegrini's side's Champions League hopes were left hanging by a thread after they were beaten 2-1 at home by Russian outfit CSKA Moscow, and unlike most supporters, this fan will have left the stadium fairly satisfied after his mid-match snack.

Perhaps even more inexplicable is the fact that the fan must have pre-planned his late lunch after turning up to the match with the loaf of bread, the peanut butter and presumably a utensil for spreading the filling. Support at the Etihad during Manchester City's campaign in Europe's top club competition has come in for criticism this season, and this supporter's snack-making antics will not have helped the situation. A first-half brace by CSKA's Seydou Doumbia was enough to seal the win for the Moscow club despite Yaya Toure's equaliser as Man City were left staring elimination in the face. Yaya Toure curled home a free kick to haul City back into the crucial Champions League clash . Toure is shown a red card late on in the game as City are reduced to 10 men on a night to forget in Manchester .

"Southampton have opened a new state-of-the-art training centre in honour of their former owner Markus Liebherr. The south coast club officially opened the Markus Liebherr Pavillion on Wednesday, which is the focal point of the Staplewood Football Development Centre. It's hoped the top class training facility will help the club continue its proud record of producing top level talent from their academy. Southampton's new training facility has been named after former owner Markus Liebherr who 'saved' the club from financial ruin . Markus Liebherr, who died in 2010, stepped in and bought the club back in 2009 when the club had suffered several years of decline, following relegation from the Premier League in 2005. The new training facility will house the club's sports science, scouting and recruitment, football administration and medical departments, as well as training, changing and dining facilities. Southampton chairman Ralph Krueger commented: 'We are delighted to officially open our new training facility and, in doing so, we are proud to pay tribute to the memory of Markus Liebherr.

'The role Markus played in saving Southampton Football Club and enabling it to be transformed into the progressive and sustainable company it is today will never be forgotten. 'In naming this outstanding new facility in his honour, Markus's vision and legacy will live on in every player and member of staff who passes through these doors.' Chief Executive Officer Gareth Rogers added: 'Markus bought the club in 2009 and his vision was to create a sustainable football club and one that plays great football. The gym at the Staplewood Football Development Centre, with machines displaying the club crest, is of the finest quality . Southampton want all the players from the different age groups to be integrated into one at the new training centre . 'Integral to that was the building of the training ground. This has required a huge investment, but it is something that we see as incredibly important in terms of the future of our club. The club is about sustainability. 'Most of the cost has come from [Markus's daughter and current owner] Katharina's wealth, so it is right that there is a lasting memory of Markus at the club.' The Saints, currently sitting second in the Premier League after an astonishing start to the season, have a track record of producing fine academy players. The likes of Real Madrid galactico Gareth Bale, Arsenal trio Theo Walcott, Calum Chambers and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, along with Adam Lallana and Luke Shaw are just a selection of recent academy graduates. Arsenal ace Theo Walcott and Real Madrid superstar Gareth Bale both graduated from Southampton's academy before moving on . England internationals Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Luke Shaw also progressed through the Saints academy before moving to Arsenal and Manchester United respectively . Southampton appear to be a club that never rests on their laurels and have already applied for permission to enhance the facilities on offer in the Markus Liebherr Pavilion. Construction of an inflatable dome over Staplewood's 3G pitch is already under way as the club hopes to integrate their academy players with the senior squad on a more permanent basis. 'This is only phase one of a big project. At the moment, we have what we call the Academy Village, which is a portacabin village at the other end of the training ground. It reflects the quality of the people we have that we've been able to produce a world-class academy in what are essentially temporary facilities,' added Executive Director of Football Les Reed. 'We're always looking forward, and the fact that we've done it in phases has meant that we've learned things as we've gone along, and everyone will benefit from that - from the academy through to the first team.'

"Pregnant actress Jaime King has revealed that it was her close friend, and fellow TV star, Lena Dunham who gave her the courage to speak out about her awful struggle to conceive her first child. Speaking to Daily Mail Online about the upcoming release of her new music video for fashion label Grace MMXIII, in which she showcases her impressive vocal talents alongside those of Oscar-nominated composer J. Ralph, the 35-year-old explained that it was only after reading about Lena's own struggles with endometriosis in her book Not That Kind of Girl, that she felt able to open up about her own fertility issues. 'Lena Dunham was a big factor in my speaking out,' she said. Making moves: Jaime King, 35, lends her vocals to a breathtaking new music video for fashion label Grace MMXIII's latest campaign . Expecting: Jaime announced earlier this month that she is expecting her second child with husband Kyle Newman, after revealing last year that she had suffered five miscarriages before conceiving her son James . 'As a dear friend who spoke out in her book about endometriosis, she helped give me the courage to ponder what kind of impact I wanted to make on this world. And I thought, ""Hey, you have a big platform to help other women and couples."" 'I know it's not a sexy topic, I know that it's extremely private and vulnerable, but at the same time I went through years of silent suffering because no one speaks about these things or the symptoms and effects of endometriosis.' Jaime, who earlier this month revealed that she is expecting her second child with husband Kyle Newman, added that she hopes her decision to speak out about her fertility struggles will help her fans to see past the perceived perfection of her 'Hollywood life'. People think I live a picture perfect life, and it started to upset me that I could possibly, in some way be presenting a curated, false idea of what my life is to my fans and to the world,' she said. 'Because that's false, it's a lie. In Hollywood we put out this totally unrealistic idea of a glamorous life because that's a part of the illusion that the public and system wants to see. A way to escape. 'However, why can we not do both? Be beautiful and inspiring yet be honest and support others on their journeys. If one more person can feel supported - then I will sacrifice any level of vanity and privacy for that. 'I will sacrifice anything to help educate and bring awareness to something so common, yet so oddly taboo. Because it shouldn't be. It's not about infertility per se - it's about the disease of PCOS and endometriosis and the prevention and care of that.' When it comes to setting an example for other mothers-to-be, Jaime, who is currently starring as restaurant owner Lemon Breeland in hit CW series Hart of Dixie alongside former OC star Rachel Bilson, could not be a better role model. While already balancing her TV role with her family life at home with her beloved husband and son, who is now 16 months old, the actress is also busy throwing her heart and soul into her music career - and confessed that she has no plans to slow down any time soon. Lean on me: Expectant mother Jaime revealed that she was given the courage to speak out about her own struggles with PCOS after reading about her friend Lena Dunham's own diagnosis in her book . Natural talent: Jaime explained that she has no plans to slow down on the work front, despite her pregnancy, noting that 'working always makes a pregnant woman happy' 'Working always makes a pregnant woman happy,' she said. 'Well, at least an insanely creative woman such as myself.' Thankfully, Jaime has plenty of creative projects to keep her occupied. As well as appearing in the soon-to-be launched video campaign for Grace MMXIII, the little black dress brand founded by Jens Grede and Erik Torstensson of Frame Denim, Jaime is also working on her own album with her Grace MMXIII video collaborator J. Ralph, which, she teased, will be available soon. But music is in no way a new focus for Jaime, who revealed that she has been 'working on music and writing poetry and songs for friends' for as long as she can remember. She has also worked on her fair share of music videos in the past, both in front of and behind the cameras. In 2012, Jaime starred in the video for Lana Del Ray's hit single Summertime Sadness, which was directed by her husband Kyle, with whom she has also co-directed a number of music videos in the past. But when it came to pursuing a singing career in her own right, under her own name, Jaime credits her close friend - and global singing sensation - Taylor Swift with giving her the inspiration that she needed to 'put her work out there'. 'Taylor was really the biggest catalyst for me to put my work out there, she lit a fire under me when she read my writing and her brilliance is unparalleled,' she said. 'She is fearless and incredibly brave, always authentic yet capable of reaching people on such a universal scale - it's very powerful.' And while she is finally ready to put her own music out there in the spotlight, Jaime explained that she still plans to remain a strong support to her friends, whom she describes as being 'the greats in their industry'. Number one fan: Jaime describes herself as a 'cheerleader' for her friends, such as Lena (L) and singer Taylor Swift (R), who she believes are 'greats' in their industries . Family ties: Jaime hopes that her struggles with PCOS will help her fans to see beyond the perceived perfection of her 'Hollywood life' and help them to find the strength to overcome their own issues . Surprise! The Hart of Dixie star announced her pregnancy with this adorable Instagram snap of her son James, who is now 16 months old . Reaching out: Jaime posted a heartfelt message to her fans on Twitter, thanking them for their continued support . 'I have an interesting dynamic with my friends because many of them are the greats in their industry,' she said. 'I have always been there to support their artistry because music has the capacity to reach people globally and truly change the planet by connecting us through song. I find by supporting someone like Taylor, or any friend who has that reach, is very important because I am deeply passionate about artists that have a voice and use it to change things for the better. 'I love being a cheerleader behind-the-scenes because in my industry I'm always front and center.' In her new music video for Grace MMXIII, however, the expectant mother happily takes center stage, showcasing her beautifully raw singing voice, as well as a number of seductive dance moves, in the dynamic and visually breathtaking clip. 'The only nerve-wracking part [about the video] is that my vocals are a live track with no auto tune, no bells and whistles, purely my voice which is the same with J. Ralph,' she said of the filming process. 'He is a visionary artist and carefully selected very rare and beautiful microphones that would naturally lend themselves to our particular style. 'For me, to sing and write, to have a band with J. Ralph is just another form of my expression as an artist. What we make musically is very poetic and dramatic which is how I've always sang - more like an old school jazz singer, not a popstar. 'I really just love every medium of art. And I want people to love it of course, to move them deeply. As a performer my goal is to always make people feel less alone in the world. To feel connected. 'But I will leave it to my friends to dominate the music industry.'","Last year, the 35-year-old, who was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome, shared details about her struggle to conceive her first child .

Ronaldo, sitting on the bench with an ice pack on his left knee after being substituted on 76 minutes, could do little to turn Portugal's fortunes around at the Stade de France after the hosts took a third-minute lead through Benzema before Pogba doubled their advantage in the second half. Portugal substitute Ricardo Quaresma set up a tense finale by slotting home a penalty for the visitors, but France held on to their slender advantage.

Goals: Quaresma (Pen, 78) France wasted no time in dominating the visitors from the offset. A low cross from the left by Antoine Griezmann found Bacary Sagna in space towards the back post, and the Manchester City defender forced  goalkeeper Rui Patricio to palm his shot away. It did little good as the rebound fell to Benzema who, with the goal gaping, tapped the ball in to make it 1-0 with just three minutes on the clock. Replays  on the big screen showed Ronaldo turning away, looking frustrated to relinquish a lead so early in the international friendly. The former Manchester United star tried to trick his way beyond France's back line but his step-overs accomplished little during a less-than-convincing opening 45 minutes for the men in white. Griezmann,  looking sharp  for France, weaved his way through Portugal's defence midway through the first half but a tame shot with the outside of his left foot was comfortably collected by Patricio. Portugal, however, were nearly gifted an equaliser shortly before the break when France tried to pass their way out  from the back. It was Nani who almost punished the hosts' carelessness as the Manchester United winger, currently on loan at Sporting Lisbon, found himself with only goalkeeper Steve Mandanda to beat. His shot across goal, seemingly in slow motion, went agonisingly wide of the  right post and France's half-time lead remained intact. After the break, Ronaldo looked hellbent on testing the France goalkeeper. The 29-year-old, rising above surrounding defenders to meet Nani's cross, saw his header destined for the bottom-left corner, only for the right hand of Mandanda to deny the two-time Ballon d'Or winner. VIDEO Scroll down to see Pogba attempt scoring from behind the goal in training . Ronaldo emerged looking hellbent to test the France goalkeeper after the break but was ultimately substituted on 76 minutes on Saturday . Portugal sensed they were good for a goal but it was France who nabbed the all-important second. Patrice Evra, starting the move from a standard throw-in on the left, found himself charging at goal before squaring the ball to Benzema. The striker in turn set the ball for  Pogba who, with a drop of the shoulder, simply tucked it away into the bottom-left corner to make it 2-0. Again, Ronaldo was shown on the big screen for the 81,000 present before being substituted with 14 minutes remaining. The man on in his place - Joao Mario - immediately had an impact by winning a penalty from a trip by Pogba. Another substitute, Quaresma, calmly slotted the resulting spot-kick beyond Mandanda to make it 2-1 with a little more than 10 minutes to play. It proved too little, too late for Portugal, but those at the Bernabeu will be more concerned by the strapping on Ronaldo's left knee than the friendly defeat. Portugal lost the international friendly 2-1 against France but Real Madrid fans will be more keen to know more about Ronaldo's fitness .

"One of CERN's most senior physicists this afternoon announced firm evidence for the existence of the elusive Higgs Boson, or God particle. Although the signal doesn't meet strict scientific standards for a 'full scientific discovery', it's still enough for researchers at CERN'S Large Hadron Collider (LHC) to predict a discovery next year. Two separate teams of scientists have been running . independent experiments in secret from each other in order to improve . the veracity of the results with the team leader of one, Fabiola Gianotti, proclaiming that they believe they've found signs of the Higgs boson in the past year. A typical 'candidate event' for the Higgs boson, including two high-energy photons whose energy (depicted by red towers) is measured by CMS. The yellow lines are the measured tracks of other particles produced in the collision . Size matters: The CMS detector weighs a staggering 13,000 tons . Higgs hunters: A graphic showing a collision at full power at the CMS detector control room . The existence of the Higgs boson was put forward in the 1960s to explain why the tiny particles that make up atoms have mass. Theory has it that as the universe cooled after the Big Bang, an invisible force known as the Higgs field formed. This field permeates the cosmos and is made up of countless numbers of tiny particles – or Higgs bosons. As other particles pass through it, they pick up mass. Any benefits in the wider world from the discovery of the Higgs boson . will be long term, but they could be felt in fields as diverse as medicine, . computing and manufacturing. Experts compare the search for the Higgs boson to the discovery of the electron. The idea of the electron – a subatomic particle – was first floated in . 1838, but its presence was not confirmed for another 60 years. A century on, the electron’s existence underpins modern science. Our . understanding of it is critical to the development of technology from . television and CDs to radiotherapy for cancer patients. 'We have built a solid foundation for the months ahead,' she said. UK particle physicist Tara Shears was also upbeat, saying that the results represented 'exciting times' with 'more to come'. Professor Stefan Soldner-Rembold, a particle physicist from the University of Manchester, told MailOnline: 'ATLAS and CMS [the two detectors in the hunt for Higgs] have presented an important milestone in their search for the Higgs particle, but it is not yet sufficient for a proper discovery given the amount of data recorded so far. 'Still, I am very excited about it, since the quality of the LHC results is exceptional.' CERN was cautious: 'The main conclusion is that the Standard Model Higgs boson, if it exists, is most likely to have a mass constrained to the range 116-130 GeV [a unit of energy equal to billion electron volts] by the ATLAS experiment, and 115-127 GeV by CMS. 'Tantalising hints have been seen by both experiments in this mass region, but these are not yet strong enough to claim a discovery. 'Higgs bosons, if they exist, are very short lived and can decay in many different ways. Discovery relies on observing the particles they decay into rather than the Higgs itself. Both ATLAS and CMS have analysed several decay channels, and the experiments see small excesses in the low mass region that has not yet been excluded.' The upshot of the experiments, therefore, is that researchers believe the Higgs is fairly lightweight, which could lead to more exciting discoveries, according to New Scientist's Lisa Grossman. She wrote: 'A Higgs of this mass, about 125 gigaelectronvolts, would blast a path to uncharted terrain. Such a lightweight would need at least one new type of particle to stabilise it.' When looking at results, the scale of certainty used by researchers is the sigma, something peculiar to particle physics. Researchers need a five-sigma level of certainty to make a bona-fide . formal discovery, which means there’s only a one in a million chance . that the result is a statistical error. Scientists only formally acknowledge an experiment’s results if they hit a . three sigma level, which means there’s only a 1 in 370 chance of them . being a fluke. The sigma probabilities announced today for the Higgs hunt have not been combined, but the overall ATLAS result was 2.3. Before the press conference began, CERN described the room as 'full to the rafters. People would hang from the lamps if the security guards would let them'. This graphic explains how protons are smashed in the Large Hadron Collider . The Higgs boson is regarded – by those who know about such things – as . the key to understanding the universe. Its job is, apparently, to give . the particles that make up atoms their mass. Without this mass, these . particles would zip though the cosmos at the speed of light, unable to . bind together to form the atoms that make up everything in the universe, . from planets  to people. The Higgs boson’s existence was predicted in 1964 by Edinburgh . University physicist Peter Higgs. But it has eluded previous searchers – . so much so that not all scientists believe in its existence. The hunt for the Higgs boson was one of the LHC's major tasks. The collider, housed in an 18-mile tunnel buried deep underground near . the French-Swiss border, smashes beams of protons – sub-atomic particles . – together at close to the speed of light, recreating the conditions . that existed a fraction of a second after the Big Bang. If the physicists’ theory is correct, a few Higgs bosons should be . created in every trillion collisions, before rapidly decaying. This decay would leave behind a ‘footprint’ that would show up as a bump in their graphs. The CMS – or Compact Muon Solenoid –  is a 13,000-ton machine that sits . 330 feet underground, while the ATLAS, at 148 feet long and 82 feet . high, is the biggest detector ever constructed.

"If Roy Hodgson is genuinely worried about the effect the captaincy of club and country will have on Wayne Rooney, there is a very easy solution. Give the armband to someone else. This is unthinkable, of course. There are no candidates of significance. Phil Jagielka is England’s only other club captain and he is not guaranteed his place. Joe Hart is isolated in goal, Gary Cahill is without leadership experience. So it is not the job that may drain Rooney, as Hodgson fears, but his status in English football. It must be hard being the main man, and that is a position he has occupied, armband or not, since 2004. Wayne Rooney (left) is captain of England and will win his 100th cap against Slovenia on Saturday . Rooney has also been given the armband by his club Manchester United . Wayne Rooney made his England debut against Australia in 2003, aged just 17 . That was the tournament England might have won, had Rooney not got seriously injured in the quarter-final against Portugal. Even so it remains a better campaign than David Beckham ever had, and he is remembered as an England hero. Rooney should win his 100th cap against Slovenia on Saturday and there will, no doubt, be plenty who sneer. Yet he could one day end up as England’s leading goalscorer and most capped player and these are achievements worthy of enormous respect. This is why there is little chance of Rooney being weighed down by the captaincy: he has felt the weight as well as the joy of international football even from his earliest years. Dick Bate, who managed Rooney in England’s Under 17 team, recalls a young man who read aloud a poem at a team dinner speaking of his love of playing for his country. Little has changed. It is perhaps because Rooney wants it so desperately that he can sometimes disappoint, or lose his way in anger. The real pity is that, shorn of team achievement, we are left to celebrate only personal milestones. Rooney suffered an injury against Portugal in the Euro 2004 quarter-final which England lost on penalties .

"A couple have gained thousands of fans after they 'counter-protested' anti-abortion pickets with bizarre slogans like 'Bring back Crystal Pepsi' and 'Who farted?'. Grayson and Tina Haver Currin came up with the idea in March to break the ice with pro-lifers outside an abortion clinic near their home in Raleigh, North Carolina. Since then the photographs of their surreal placards have gone viral - prompting dozens of other pro-choice activists to join them every Saturday morning. Scroll down for video . Not your usual pastime: Tina Haver Currin (right) and her husband Grayson have won hordes of fans with their surreal protests against pro-life activists outside an abortion clinic near their home in Raleigh, North Carolina . Not seeing the funny side: Mr Haver Currin (left) said activists have prayed for him and called him wicked . Odd one out: In many of the photos the protesters look as though they are trying to ignore the comic signs . Music writer Grayson, 31, and copywriter Tina, 27, married last year and came up with the idea to stand next to activists on Saturday mornings with a sign saying: 'Weird hobby'. Others since then have read 'I like turtles', 'World's worst nanny ad' and 'Only racists salt their watermelon'. The slogans earn them some bemused reactions from the activists themselves - who perhaps unsurprisingly, have failed to see the funny side. 'They pray for us,' Mr Haver Currin told MailOnline. 'They tell us that God will destroy the wicked, including us. They tell us that we were once sinners just like them. 'They tell us that we're angry because we believe in God so much it hurts us - this one is particularly cute! Mr Haver Currin said: 'Mostly, they put down their signs and bullhorns and berate us instead of the women' Covert: Sometimes the activists appear behind their rival activists to sneak funny photos behind their backs . Overt: And sometimes, their methods are designed to attract as much attention as is humanly possible . 'But mostly, they put down their signs and bullhorns and berate us instead of the women and families going into the clinic for whatever reason they might have.' He added: 'That is the goal - to provide a distraction and shield for the people who need the clinic. And the ultimate goal is to drive these people away completely.' The couple, who met four years ago at a rock concert, began their idea spontaneously when they passed an anti-abortion protest on their way home from a garden centre. 'We both clinched up a bit, and I said, in an offhand way to Tina, 'It would be funny to make a sign that said Weird Hobby with an arrow and point it at the folks holding Babies Are Murdered Here signs', he said. 'I thought she'd just laugh it off, because I'm full of silly ideas. But she was into it. Provocative: The couple admitted they had experienced hostile reactions from some of the pro-life activists . Surreal: To show what they see as the illogical side of pro-life thinking, the picketers make their signs absurd . Joke: The pro-abortion activists also can't help poking fun at the spelling abilities of their rival protesters . 'On our way home, we did the deed, post it to our various social media outlets, and people flipped.' Their protests over one of the nation's most hotly-contested issues duly made headlines when they posted the images on their blog Saturday Chores. Since then the images have been shared thousands of times, and earned them some heavy flak from pro-life advocates who say they are trivialising an important debate. But Mr Haver Currin said: 'There are things that need protesting in this world, and we're not always sure how to protest them. 'By adding humor, we've refused to have an argument with the pro-life movement, because we know that argument will not be won. The argument must be changed. Bemused: The slogans are deliberately designed to be as ludicrously inappropriate as possible . Positive note: The couple said they wanted to combat protesters with chirpy and irreverant messages . Serious: There are also more earnest messages too after dozens of people began joining the couple . 'This is a conversation about equality and freedom.' Anti-abortion protests are widespread and earned a big boost in June, when the Supreme Court said a 'buffer zone' stopping activists from getting to close to clinics violated free speech. The justices struck down the 35ft zones in Massachusetts saying they was too sweeping, taking in sidewalks which have been a place for political campaigning for hundreds of years. To date the couple have only picketed the same protesters at a single clinic less than 10 miles from their home, the A Preferred Women's Health Center (APWHC) in Raleigh. If they manage to evict the protesters out of embarrassment or simply annoyance, they claim they will move on to the next clinic. Support: Nowadays, the couple are far from alone in their comedic Saturday morning vigils in North Carolina . Catchy: The idea has been taken up in San Francisco, where a copycat protest was held last week (pictured) But some allies are way ahead of them - as a copycat 'counter-protest' sprang up in San Francisco last week. And the couple have no plans to scale down their operation. 'The goal has never been to go viral, to be some cute Internet couple or whatnot,' Mr Haver Currin said. 'The goal has been and remains to shame people who feel like shaming women and families exercising their legal right and to distract them from shaming those people.'","Grayson Haver Currin, 31, and wife Tina began their protests in March .

"A family told of their horror at being threatened with jail by the RSPCA which falsely accused them of animal cruelty and insisted that their beloved family cat be put to sleep. Richard Byrnes and his wife Samantha suffered two years of trauma after an RSPCA inspector seized their cat, 16-year-old Claude, in May 2013 claiming that he was too thin and had matted fur. After 24 hours of agonising negotiations Claude was put to sleep by a local vet against the wishes of Mr and Mrs Byrnes who were threatened with prison if they refused to sign the release form. Scroll down for video . Threatened: Samantha and Richard Byrnes with daughter Eloise, 13, (front left) and son Dominic, 15, (right) They were given no chance to appeal the forced euthanasia despite the fact that Claude was in good health for his age, and their teenage children who had grown up alongside him were not even allowed to attend the clinic to say goodbye. In the months that followed the RSPCA issued proceedings against the family for animal cruelty which saw Mr Byrnes, an accountant at Transport for London, repeatedly dragged to court to plead his innocence. On Friday, more than two years after Claude’s untimely death and after spending around £5,000 on legal representation, the CPS ruled there was not enough evidence to proceed and the case was dismissed. Speaking yesterday Mr Byrnes condemned the aggressive approach of the charity and spoke of the trauma his family had suffered after being treated ‘like criminals.’ He also spoke of his fear that many other loving, law-abiding pet owners could find themselves in the same situation as a result of what he called the charity’s ‘bullying tactics’ and added that any legal costs he may be awarded will come not from the charity but from central funds meaning the tax payer foots the bill. He said: ‘There is no risk for them in prosecuting cases like this, so if they lose the tax payer picks up the bill. Claude had a lifelong aversion to being combed or trimmed meaning his coat frequently became matted . The couple's daughter Eloise Byrnes (pictured with Claude) was not allowed to say her final goodbyes to cat . ‘After all we have been through there is no negative impact on them at all.’ Mr and Mrs Byrnes, from Tring, Hertfordshire, adopted Claude from a friend as a six-month-old kitten when they moved to the rural town in the late nineties. They went on to have two children, Dominic, 15, and Eloise, 13, but always regarded Claude as ‘the original member of the family.’ Claude, a long-haired breed of cat with fine but extremely thick hair, had a lifelong aversion to being combed or trimmed meaning his coat frequently became matted. At first Mr Byrnes, 53, coped with this by taking him to local vets who would give him an anaesthetic before trimming him. But after few times this was stopped as the vets feared that regularly subjecting him to a general anaesthetic would do more harm than good. Mr Byrnes said: ‘From about 2003 on we were left to do it ourselves, I would let him sit on me and stroke him until he fell asleep and then Sam would carefully snip away the worst bits of his fur. ‘The only thing that worked through his hair were hairdressing scissors and so she would sit there hour after hour snipping away. Claude was in good health at the time of his death and Mr Byrnes is still fighting to be given back his ashes . ‘The irony that she should be accused of animal neglect after the care she gave that animal - it couldn’t be further from the truth.’ After a neighbour complained about his appearance an RSPCA inspector visited the family in June 2012 and Mr Byrnes agreed to monitor the animal’s health since he was now approaching old age. But after another complaint the same inspector returned in June 2013 and convinced Mrs Byrnes to allow her to take their cat to the vets for a checkup. She took Claude to a different vet than the one normally used by Mr and Mrs Byrnes and called back within an hour to say he would have to be put down immediately. Initially the couple refused to sign the paperwork to allow the procedure and were told to attend a meeting with the vet and the RSPCA the next morning. That night, lost as to what to do next, Mr Byrnes typed in ‘RSPCA bullying’ to an internet search engine and discovered a charity called The Self Help Group which advises people being prosecuted by the RSPCA. They told him to tape every conversation he had with charity and to seek legal representation - he believes that it is only as a result of that taped evidence that he escaped prosecution. In the meeting the couple found themselves threatened with court action and the police if they did comply with the charity’s demands. In a transcript from the meeting the Inspector says: ‘ If you two don’t authorise that the vet can euthanise Claude then there is the option of overriding that decision where I can go to the police, who will authorise it for me. ‘You can also end up with a fine or potential imprisonment. Imprisonment is very rare but because it’s being dealt with by magistrates’ court that is an option.’ On Friday the CPS ruled there was not enough evidence to proceed and the couple's case was dismissed . The couple found themselves threatened with court and police action if they did not comply to charity's rules . Mr Byrnes added: ‘We came under increasing pressure to sign the forms, she [the inspector] said things like “the law is on my side” and “I don’t want to but I know I can force you to sign.” ‘I didn’t want to the police involved so in the end I signed it, Sam to her eternal credit refused. ‘Then we asked if we could take him home for one last night so the kids could say goodbye to him but they refused. ‘We asked if they could even just delay it until 4 o’clock so we could pick them up from school - the vet was about to agree this and then the inspector interrupted and said it had to be done immediately. ‘I thought my daughter would never speak to me again.’ The procedure went ahead and following a last minute request by the RSPCA in April this year that a post-mortem be carried out, the family were never even allowed to have his body back to bury him in the back garden as they wished. In a final insult the examination only served to prove the defence case that despite being underweight Claude was in relatively good health at the time of his death and Mr Byrnes is still fighting to be given back his ashes. Now he also wishes to warn other pet owners in the hope that others can be spared the ordeal that he went through. He added: ‘We could have ended up with a criminal record for the rest of our lives for something we didn’t even do and there was no-one there to help us. ‘The RSPCA is the only non-statutory body that can bring their own prosecutions, even the NSPCC has to collect evidence and then submit it to the CPS to make a decision, how can this be allowed?’ Yesterday the RSPCA maintained they brought the case against the Byrneses as a result of ‘very real serious concerns about the welfare of Claude.’ It added that the family agreed in writing to having him put down and that the charity ‘only undertakes prosecutions where it considers there is sufficient evidence and it is in the public interest to do so.’ However this is the second time this year that the state has been forced to intervene to prevent the charity from prosecuting a cat owner. In another incident the CPS halted a case after police broke down the door of an autistic woman’s home to remove a cat she refused to give up. Like the Byrneses they ruled there was insufficient evidence to prosecute Julie Nadian, 49, who was later reunited with her pet after an eleven month battle.

"Targeted by MI5: Michael Adebolajo, Lee Rigby's killer, pictured just after the gruesome attack on Woolwich High Street, London, in May . The security services were in the dock last night for missing a decade of opportunities to stop the fanatical killers of Lee Rigby . Just three months before the appalling murder in Woolwich, MI5 was trying to recruit Michael Adebolajo as an informant. He had been on their radar for ten years and in 2010 was even arrested with fellow Al Qaeda followers in Kenya. Adebolajo, 29, and Michael Adebowale, 22, face dying behind bars after they were yesterday convicted of butchering Fusilier Rigby outside his barracks in South-East London. The pair are feared to be part of a new wave of so-called ‘just do it’ terrorists who can explode into action without warning. Yesterday Cressida Dick, the country’s most senior counter-terrorism chief, said police officers must be ready to protect their military colleagues. ‘We know that some people who have a completely perverted ideology do regard soldiers as a target,’ warned the Met assistant commissioner. As senior Whitehall sources said they believed a number of the killers’ accomplices were still on the loose, it can be revealed that: . Adebolajo kissed the Koran when he and Adebowale were convicted of murdering Fusilier Rigby at the end of an astonishing four-week Old Bailey trial. The victim’s parents, estranged wife and fiancée were overcome with emotion as the jury of eight women and four men returned their verdicts in just 90 minutes.

They had endured days of evidence detailing how Fusilier Rigby was almost beheaded by Adebolajo, who was allowed to espouse his twisted views from the witness box. Mr Justice Sweeney told of his gratitude and admiration for the soldier’s family who, he said, had shown great dignity throughout the most harrowing of evidence. ‘I’m extremely grateful to them and can only sympathise with what has happened to them and its continued effect upon all their lives,’ he added. Kissing the Koran: Adebolajo and his accomplice Michael Adebowale were convicted of murdering Fusilier Rigby yesterday after 90 minutes of deliberations at the end of an astonishing four-week Old Bailey trial . The full story of how the two men slipped through the fingers of Britain’s security services can now be told for the first time. MI5 is being investigated by Parliament’s intelligence and security committee and its chairman, Sir Malcolm Rifkind, has said it has serious questions to answer. Adebolajo and Adebowale were brought up in lower middle-class Nigerian Christian families, with parents who dreamed of their going to university. The path to Woolwich began in 2003 when Adebolajo joined high-profile extremist group al-Muhajiroun and changed his name to Mujahid, meaning ‘one who engages in jihad’. Over the following years he cropped up again and again at Islamist events. But it was in 2010 that MI5 appears to have missed the most glaring opportunity to stop Adebolajo after he was caught trying to enter Somalia. The arrest linked him to some of the most dangerous terrorists in the world, including Lewthwaite. Yet, despite being openly accused of terrorism and being deported to London, he was given free rein to continue on his radical path. Mombasa’s anti-terror chief Elijah Rop said he warned the British not to allow his release. He said: ‘We gave very honest advice but the High Commissioner ignored us.’ Adebowale pictured speaking at a demonstration associated with radical cleric Anjem Choudary: A week before the attack, Adebolajo was preaching that jihadis did not need to travel abroad to kill British soldiers . Thames House, headquarters of MI5: The agency is being investigated by Parliament¿s intelligence and security committee and its chairman, Sir Malcolm Rifkind, has said it has serious questions to answer . MI5 focused on trying to recruit . Adebolajo. He was offered money and mobile phones in repeated approaches . by officers who asked him to spy on other Muslims. Three other members . of his family, his elder brother Jeremiah, sister Christiana and . brother-in-law James, were also approached. By late 2012, just months before the Woolwich attack, Adebolajo was so fed up with MI5 that he complained to a lawyer. Fusilier Lee Rigby poses in his ceremonial . uniform: His family were overcome with emotion as the jury  returned . their verdicts at the Old Bailey yesterday . A week before the attack, Adebolajo preached that jihadis did not need to travel abroad to kill soldiers. A Muslim convert, who gave his name only as Abdullah, overheard him preaching outside Glyndan Community Centre in Woolwich after Friday prayers. He told BBC London News: ‘When we were speaking about the killing of soldiers or the Army he said, “We don’t need to go there, their boys are here, their boys are here”. ‘At that point I didn’t have clue what he was talking about. One of his last words he said was, “If I don’t see you now, God willing I’ll see you in the next life”.’ After Adebolajo was arrested for butchering Fusilier Rigby, he refused to tell counter-terrorism police where he lived. But in a telling remark, the Old Bailey was told he said ‘MI5 could provide the location because they had visited him earlier this year’. Asked to elaborate on his contact with MI5 while in the witness box, Adebolajo said: ‘There is a lot more to come out on this.’ Adebolajo’s brother-in-law, James Thompson, who himself converted to Islam in 2005, said the interest of the security services was relentless. He accused the agency of making his brother-in-law more extreme. Ministers must confront doubts about the effectiveness of the £100million Prevent programme, which aims to deter extremism. A radical preacher who taught Adebolajo was offered £100,000 to help fight terrorism but turned it down.","Michael Adebolajo was approached by agents courting him as an informer .

"Walking the dogs very early yesterday, I thought long and hard about Saturday’s match. The Test was there to be won and we came up short. November 8, 2014 must go down as the day this England set-up started smelling the coffee and really taking stock of where they are. England need to move on from all this team-building, pride in the shirt, old players’ names in the tunnel, tweets from fans, ‘You don’t play for England, you represent England’, all that stuff. England complain about a refereeing decision, but the time for excuses is running out . Owen Farrell runs at the All Blacks defence, but England need to start playing nuts-and-bolts rugby, and winning . VIDEO England 21-24 New Zealand highlights . These are all a given in any high-performing team and we don’t need this corporate jargon. Far too much was made of Martin Johnson’s ‘failure’. England won 10 out of 13 games in 2011 under Johnno. I’d love to know what he is making of all of this. From now on it has to be all about nuts-and-bolts rugby. We have lost the last five against New Zealand and now we have to circle the wagons, get some sulphur flying around, add some real anger into this team and concentrate on playing ruthless and world-class rugby. Winning the next match is all that matters. Create a siege mentality . It is time for the England coaching team to step up to the plate. And I mean that positively. What an opportunity for a coach. England will go head to head with a stack of good sides in the next 12 months, with hard-nosed ‘winning’ coaches who all have England in their sights. Warren Gatland and Wales, Joe Schmidt and Ireland, a new-look Scotland under Vern Cotter, Michael Cheika with Australia, Heyneke Meyer for the Boks and, of course, Steve Hansen and his All Blacks. Stuart Lancaster is about to come up against some of the best teams, and coaches, in world rugby . We may love beating them but they love beating us more, especially at Twickenham. This will only intensify as we begin celebrating a home World Cup. We do not have exclusivity over ‘pride in the shirt’. We need to create a siege mentality now. Put a kicker at No 12 . When the game develops like it did on Saturday, England badly lack a natural kicker at No 12. Kyle Eastmond was excellent in New Zealand territory for the first 20 minutes, but England’s lack of a tactical kicking game was so evident in the second half when they got pinned in their own half. I’ve been advocating this for a long time now and I see one or two commentators are beginning to back the notion! Owen Farrell kicks clear on Saturday, but England need a second option for their tactical kicking game . With Danny Cipriani out of favour, Farrell (left) could be picked to play outside George Ford (right) There is a strong argument for moving Owen Farrell to 12. In my ideal XV I’d do just that and start with Danny Cipriani at No 10. Those two in harness would give me the midfield options I am looking for. I’m not sure yet whether George Ford is ready to start at fly-half but I’d love to be proved wrong and to see Ford and Farrell being given a chance to play alongside one another for 80 minutes. Tick some more boxes . England must think seriously about the structure of the team. Keep it simple. What do we need to beat the world’s best? Firstly, a nasty, aggressive, ball-winning front five who come out on top at the set-piece. Box ticked, Graham Rowntree has done an outstanding job in this department. Secondly, a well-balanced back row with pace. Box not ticked. Billy Vunipola, for all his virtues, hasn’t got the pace for this level at present and can’t play 80 minutes. England's pack demonstrated that they could dominated at the set-piece, with the front five excellent . The back row is a problem, and Billy Vunipola lacks the pace to perform at the very highest level . We have options although for unfathomable reasons Steffon Armitage has been declared ineligible. I’d play James Haskell at No 8, Chris Robshaw at No 6 and Armitage at openside. And if we pick dangerous attacking wings, we need to use them. Box not ticked. Other than returning kicks, if Semesa Rokoduguni touched the ball in attack on Saturday, I must have missed it. Lack of caps no excuse . Everyone has to stop talking about England as this young, inexperienced side. This is not an England Development team, this is THE England XV. I applaud the selection of the debutants, even if Anthony Watson’s first cap was well overdue. But to suggest their inexperience is a definitive factor is not accurate. The likes of Dave Atwood in the second row demonstrated that inexperience is not an issue . The evidence for this is in the front five where England dominated. We had George Kruis and Dave Attwood, effectively fourth and fifth-choice second rowers, and and an unfamiliar front row – all were magnificent. What we lacked was the game plan and key selection decisions to utilise the platform the pack provided. Beware the Boklash . This week is going to be one of the toughest of Stuart Lancaster’s career. There will be a huge backlash from South Africa after losing to Ireland. My team from those available: Watson; Rokoduguni, Burrell, Farrell, Wade; Cipriani, Care; Marler, Hartley, Wilson, Attwood, Lawes, Robshaw (c), Armitage, Haskell. The Boks will be up for it physically more than ever, so England must look to out-think and outsmart them and that needs great coaching and great selecting. Mike Brown is experiencing a dip in form and confidence — it happens — so I would go for broke and introduce Anthony Watson at full-back. Make HQ a fortress . The Twickenham crowd can still go horribly quiet and England need them to up their game if home advantage is to count for anything at the World Cup. Building an atmosphere is much more than putting white flags on seats and playing patriotic music. Are you really going to start cheering for England just because the big screen says ‘Come on England’? The Twickenham crowd may have drowned out the haka, but they were still quiet in patches . The boards flash up the message come on England, as Richie McCaw dives over for a New Zealand try . I was put out to see a huge All Blacks billboard just outside the ground, even the electronic boards in the stadium said: ‘We welcome New Zealand’. The fans have a big role to play but first they must be excited by the team. It was very flat on Saturday and as a coach you need to ask why that is. Twickenham must become a fortress, NOT the home of rugby. Life after O’Driscoll . In Ireland, the King is dead, long live the King. Brian O’Driscoll is gone but Ireland have a wonderfully gifted talisman in Jonny Sexton. That was a fantastic, totally convincing win over South Africa. Ireland are profiting from having a nailed-on half-back pairing in Sexton and Conor Murray. Jonny Sexton holds off a tackle during a game in which he showed he can be Ireland's talisman . Optimistic over Wales . Wales can still score tries against the best and if I was England that would concern me. I don’t share some people’s pessimism over Wales falling short against southern hemisphere sides. Once they secure that breakthrough win, there will be others. Wales showed they can score tries against the best teams, and that's bad news for England next year . Hail the great Scots . Scotland are alive and kicking and I expect them to give the All Blacks a good run for their money on Saturday. Don’t underestimate their win over Argentina. I enjoyed Scotland’s speed of thought and deed. The Scots are always at their best playing at pace.","England should move Saracens fly-half Owen Farrell to twelve .
Kyle Eastmond started well but England need a greater tactical kicking game .
Back row needs a shake-up, Billy Vunipola lacks the pace for this level .
England need to make Twickenham a fortress, not just the home of rugby ."
"Jose Mourinho has reignited his feud with Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini by claiming he ‘killed Mark Clattenburg’. Pellegrini criticised Chelsea’s manager after the 1-1 draw between their teams at the Etihad Stadium last Sunday and accused Mourinho of approaching the game ‘like a small team’. Mourinho finally responded yesterday by reminding Pellegrini —who rarely gets involved in confrontations — that he broke his own rules last season by criticising Clattenburg. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Jose Mourinho: Manuel Pellegrini killed Mark Clattenburg . Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has claimed Manuel Pellegrini 'killed' Mark Clattenburg earlier this season . Frank Lampard refused to celebrate after scoring for City against former club Chelsea in last week's 1-1 draw . Referee Clattenburg booked Lampard during Man City's 2-2 draw with Arsenal earlier this month . Man City boss Pellegrini claimed Clattenburg's performance had cost his side victory at The Emirates . The official was in charge when City lost 3-2 at Liverpool at the end of the season and when they drew at Arsenal in the title run-in. Mourinho said: ‘It was not one or two or three times that he told everyone he doesn’t speak about referees. He killed Clattenburg. ‘Three or four times he says he doesn’t speak about me or my teams — he did it once more. It’s for you to comment. When I said I don’t want to speak about him, that’s what I try to do . Mourinho and Pellegrini have never seen eye to eye, with the Chilean attacking the Chelsea manager's tactics . ‘Don’t speak with me. If you want a story, speak with him, not me. I follow my line. I don’t want to discuss any situation.’ Mourinho is preparing for today’s home clash with Aston Villa in the Barclays Premier League without Brazil midfielder Ramires. He has a groin injury and has already been ruled out of the Champions League group game against Sporting on Tuesday and next Sunday’s date with Arsenal. Mourinho hopes Ramires will be available after the international break. Yesterday, he also spoke about his concerns if Spain call up Diego Costa next week for their Euro 2016 qualifiers. The Chelsea forward missed the Capital One Cup win over Bolton on Wednesday but will be available for today’s clash with Paul Lambert’s third-placed Villa. Costa returned from the last round of internationals with a hamstring problem in his left leg, but Vicente del Bosque, Spain’s coach, still intends to call him up for games against Slovakia and Luxembourg. Like our MailOnline Sport Facebook page. Mourinho revealed Brazilian midfielder Ramires will miss Chelsea's clashes with Aston Villa and Arsenal . Mourinho said: ‘The moment a national team wants to select a Chelsea player, I’m nobody. It’s their decision. They can do what they want. It’s completely out of my control. What I think and what I feel doesn’t play a part. 'Everyone is working hard. He (Costa) is the first to do that. He’s working hard in his recovery with the medical staff and the conditioning staff. Mentally, he’s ready for every game. Physically he’s not. ‘I’m nobody to make that decision. Everybody knows what is going on with Diego. Everyone knows he’s in trouble for quite a long time. But I’m nobody. Diego Costa (left) has been in spectacular form since joining Chelsea this summer . Jose Mourinho hopes star striker Diego Costa is not selected for Spain for their upcoming internationals . ‘We can communicate, send exams and reports, but it’s their decision. After the game against Arsenal, or even before that when they make the pre-selection, everything is in their hands. I can do nothing.’ Costa, who has scored seven times already in the Premier League since his move from Atletico Madrid, starts against Villa. Mourinho fell out spectacularly with Lambert last season but claims he is now refusing to discuss other managers or players. Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho had a touchline falling out with Aston Villa's Paul Lambert . The outspoken Portuguese manager (right) is now refusing to discuss other managers and players . It appears the club, along with Mourinho, have made a policy decision to gag the manager after last season’s confrontations. Mourinho said: ‘I respect every opponent’s manager and, when I play at home, it’s my duty to wait for them in the tunnel when they come at the same time as me. ‘If they come later or earlier, I go to their bench and shake their hands. Tomorrow will not be different.’ VIDEO FFP penalties should be points - Mourinho .","Jose Mourinho reignites feud with Manuel Pellegrini by claiming Man City boss 'killed Mark Clattenburg'

"A man ended up in hospital after jumping into a hot spring on the northern Nevada desert to rescue a dog. Gerlach volunteer fire chief Willard Gooch said the man was scalded by water in the Double Hot Springs on the Black Rock Desert, about 120 miles north of Reno. He added that the man was flown by medical helicopter to a Reno hospital, where his condition was not immediately released. The Double Hot Springs in Black Rock Desert reach about 180 degrees with very steep and slippery banks . 'There's three (hot springs) that's out there that you can get pretty burned from,' Mr Gooch told the Reno Gazette-Journal. 'There are several out there that people need to pay attention to.' The hot springs at Black Rock Desert can be streams or deep ponds of boiling water, he added. The Double Hot Springs reach about 180 degrees with very steep and slippery banks. Although the area around the springs is fenced, dogs have been known to jump into or drink from them. Mr Gooch told the paper that he has seen at least six cases in recent years of people jumping into the hot springs at Black Rock Desert trying to save an animal. In 2000, a 27-year-old Reno woman and a friend were walking near the Double Hot Springs when their dogs leaped into one of the pools. They tried to rescue the animals and ended up getting severely burned themselves. The woman died from her burns and her friend suffered second- and third-degree burns over 80 percent of his body. Both dogs had to be euthanized. The status of the dog in the latest accident was not immediately known. Although the area around the springs is fenced, dogs have been known to jump into or drink from them . 'With this being an open bird season, a lot of people are out here with their hunting dogs,' Mr Gooch said. 'That's what's scary is that people don't really know how fast it all happens.' Mr Gooch said he's taken his water-loving hunting dog to Black Rock Desert, but he added that it is important that pet owners take the right precautions. 'Keep your dogs in the vehicle until you look around the area to see where the hot springs are before you let them out,' he said. 'I just suggest people to really be cautions when they let their dogs out near hot springs, especially if they love water.' Many visitors simply do not pay attention to where the springs are, he said. 'Some of those springs reach 180 degrees,' Mr Gooch said. 'That's how hot a lot of these springs are here. I wish people would understand how hot they are.' 'It happens quite often, more often than it should,' he said.","Man injured by scalding water in Double Hot Springs on Black Rock Desert .

"Paul McGinley has made no secret of the fact that Ryder Cups are won with great teamwork, so it should come as no surprise to see him and Justin Rose expertly riding a tandem bicycle together. The duo were taking part in a special race against Ian Poulter and Chinese golfer Wu Ashun ahead of this week's BMW Masters in Shanghai. Just as most of McGinley's pairings at Gleneagles worked perfectly in tandem, his ride with Rose looked to be a great success... even if the Englishman admitted afterwards: 'I was hanging on for dear life.' Paul McGinley and Justin Rose ride a tandem bicycle across the fairways at Lake Malaren Golf Club . Rose looks a little worried as the pair head off on their race (left) but appears to have relaxed later (right) Rose and McGinley were racing against Ian Poulter and Wu Ashun in a special race in China . Perhaps the US Ryder Cup taskforce, set up to address their consistent failures in the biennial showpiece against Europe, should take a look at the pictures. Perhaps Phil Mickelon should be encouraged to ride in tandem with the next American captain. Well, good luck with that. The BMW Masters is the first event of the European Tour's season-ending Final Series, which sees the climax of The Race to Dubai. But after Rory McIlroy's spectacular summer, Rose admits he has little chance of catching the Open and US PGA champion to be crowned Europe's No 1 this year. Instead, the former US Open winner has set himself a new target during the next month: reaching No 2 in the world rankings. Rose is currently ranked sixth in the world but has been as high as third following his triumph at Merion last year. He now wants to go one better. Rose, Poulter, Wu and McGinley play from a bunker on the 18th hole prior to the BMW Masters . Poulter tees off during the pro-am event prior to the tournament, which starts on Thursday . Former US Open champion Rose gets in the swing ahead of the first of this year's Final Series events . 'I’m not sure I can catch Rory in The Race to Dubai,' said Rose, who is eighth in the money list but a long way behind the runaway leader. 'But the bonus pool runs deep down to 15th and I want to strengthen my world ranking as much as possible. 'If I can play well and maybe win a couple of tournaments between now and the end of the season, I could probably get up to second in the world, which would be a personal best. So there’s always something to play for.' Poulter arrived at Lake Malaren Golf Club hoping for a happy ending to a difficult season. The Englishman's latest troubling episode was being branded a 'Lil Girl' by PGA of America president Ted Bishop, who was subsequently sacked for his comments. Captain McGinley celebrates winning the Ryder Cup with his team  at Gleneagles last month . Poulter currently sits outside the top 60 who earn a place in the season-ending Dubai showpiece. But the Englishman was in a positive frame of mind after arriving in the country where he sealed his biggest career win to date, the WGC-HSBC Champions in 2012. A fun warm-up round of match play against Rose on the course they co-designed at Mission Hills appears to have helped Poulter's mood too. 'It’s always nice to come back to Asia and I’ve got a decent record here,' said Poulter. 'I've played well on this golf course in the past, so I’m looking forward to getting going. 'I’ve been in China for five days, and opening the golf course with Justin was great fun. We had a little match play competition yesterday and he managed to beat me 3 and 2, so it would be nice if I can go one up on him this week.'","Paul McGinley and Justin Rose took part in tandem bike race in China .

"Pictured for the first time, these are the two teenage girls who were raped and murdered before their bodies were found swinging from a mango tree in northern India this week. Three brothers today confessed to attacking and killing the young cousins, named Murti and Pushpa, in a case which has horrified India. The crime provoked national outrage after it emerged that police in the village of Katra initially refused to investigate the girls' murder due to their low-caste status. Warning: graphic content . Victims: Teenage cousins Pushpa, left, and Murti, right, were raped and murdered before their bodies were hung from a tree . Agony: Murti's father Sohan is comforted by his mother after the death of the young girl . Outrage: The scene in Katra village in northern India, where three men have admitted raping and murdering the cousins . Grief: The parents of one of the victims, Murti, have spoken of being sidelined by the police because of their low caste . The alleged killers - Pappu, Awadhesh and Urvesh Yadav - are members of the dominant Yadav caste, to which most of the local police also belong. Low-caste villagers from the community in Uttar Pradesh state have expressed concern that they could also be targeted in the wake of the horrifying attacks. Police officer Atul Saxena said today that the three men arrested over the crime had admitted their guilt while being held in custody. He added that the authorities are still searching for two more suspects, and have prepared identity sketches in a bid to track them down. Horror: The two girls were found hanging from a mango tree after going missing on Tuesday night . Demands: Protesters march in support of bringing the girls' killers to justice . Gathering: Villagers standing and watching the arrival of a helicopter carrying Mayawati, a leading Uttar Pradesh politician .

Scene: Police and locals guarding the tree where the two girls were found dead . In addition to the three suspected murderers, two police officers have been arrested for allegedly ignoring the victims' parents when they reported that the girls, aged 14 and 15, had gone missing. The girls' murder has prompted protests in New Delhi and other Indian cities, in an echo of the outpouring of grief which came when a student was raped and killed on a bus in the capital in 2012. In their home village, poor locals described their worries that they would be vulnerable to a similar attack in the future. Murti and Pushpa disappeared on Tuesday night after going to a field near their home to relieve themselves, because they do not have their own toilet. Studies: The mother of one of the girls holds on to her daughter's schoolbook . Bereaved: Murti's father Sohan paid tribute to his daughter, saying she was a keen linguist . Despair: Murti's mother said she wants the killers to be hanged in order to secure justice . Mourning: Sohan is keen to see his daughter's killers brought to justice . Poverty: The girls were killed while relieving themselves in a field because their house does not have a toilet . Most low-caste families are in the same situtation, with only the richest residents have access to a private bathroom. 'We are scared,' villager Renu Devi told CNN. 'If this could happen to them, it could happen with us also.' Murti's father Sohan vowed to seek justice for his daughter as he described how she was a keen language student at the private school where he paid for her education.

"Pregnant Josie Cunningham has revealed how she was tricked for 18 months into believing the father of her baby was Premier League footballer Curtis Davies. The wannabe glamour model, who rose to fame after undergoing a £4,800 breast enlargement on the NHS, claims she was 'manipulated' into having a relationship with a man who pretended to be the Hull City star. Just hours before going into labour, the 24-year-old told her 55,000 Twitter followers she had been 'physically fooled' by the imposter - despite searching images of the player on Google when she was warned the man could be a fraud. Scroll down for video . Wannabe glamour model Josie Cunningham, pictured left, has claimed she was tricked into sleeping with a man who claimed to be footballer Curtis Davies, pictured right . Josie posted numerous tweets, as well as a four-page letter, explaining what had happened . The 24-year-old made the revelation to her 55,000 Twitter followers, saying she felt 'dirty, ashamed and devastated' after finding out the truth . Posting four pages about the situation on Twitter, she wrote: 'I feel so dirty, ashamed and devastated. I've been completely manipulated by a man for 18 months pretending to be a Premiership footballer. 'I feel physically fooled by him and had sex with someone who claimed to be someone he wasn't. 'I let a conman put his hands on me, kiss me with his lips and fill my head with lies.' Josie, from Leeds, described how she met the young man in a hotel in Leicester in April last year and started sleeping with him soon after - but he turned out to 'just be a lookalike'. He had first made contact with her after she had appeared on the front page of a national newspaper and sent her a photo of Curtis Davies, which he had taken from the internet. She continued: 'I'd be lying if I said I didn't get a kick from thinking a Premiership footballer was interested in me. 'I've been called a liar for months and I've had my head held high thinking the whole country was wrong — when it was really me. I've stayed in hotels with him and I've poured my heart out to him.' She went on to explain in a further Tweet that the couple were not in a 'full-blown relationship' which is how he managed to keep up the guise, adding 'I know I'm not that clever'. Her agent Rob Cooper told The Sun said: 'She's been suffering with stress over this whole Curtis Davies thing. She's in bits about it. But hopefully she'll be OK.' Mr Davies, 29, who signed for the club last year, lives with his girlfriend Laura Dearn, 25. There is no suggestion he has been involved with Josie. Hull City declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline. MailOnline has also contacted his agent for comment. She made the announcement as she went in labour, where she is expecting to give birth to a girl . The controversial mother-of-two, who met the imposter in April last year, said she felt 'physically sick' having to make the admission . She reassured followers that she 'of course' Googled Curtis Davies, but was still tricked into believing he was the Hull City FC captain . The revelation is the latest episode in what has been an ongoing drama since Josie revealed she was pregnant. Earlier this month, the mother-of-two stepped out with a Girl Power painting sprawled over her bump, before announcing she would be setting up a trust fund to pay for her unborn daughter's boob job. Josie had previously suggested she would reimburse the NHS for the cost of her controversial breast enhancement surgery. But, using the hashtag #BritishPublic0JosieCunningham1, Josie said she made the decision because '80% of the country are against' her. Josie sent several tweets explaining the situation, adding: 'I know I'm not that clever' She tweeted: 'Getting bored of people being horrible at every opportunity. When I discovered I was having a girl & cancelling the tickets (cont)- I made sure I had a way of getting the £4,800 back to the NHS for my boob job, because I knew people would bang on about that forever. 'HOWEVER, considering 80% of the country are against me, i'll have the £4800 put in a trust fund for my little girl when she's 18 so she can have a boob job. Job done! #BritishPublic0JosieCunningham1'. The mother-of-two had been devastated when doctors told her she was having a third boy. She admitted she smoked a whole packet of cigarettes and drank one glass of wine after the other because she felt 'genuinely gutted'. Afterwards, she decided to sell tickets to the live birth of her child. Four tickets to the home birth had sold out in just 14 minutes - netting her £30,000. There is no suggestion Curtis Davies has had any involvement with Josie Cunningham . It is thought that three of the four tickets were purchased by journalists while the fourth is believed to have been bought by somebody described as 'a super-fan'. She later said that 50 fans would be able to log on to the video chat service Skype and watch the former prostitute's delivery via videolink. But, earlier this month, despite saying some of the money would go back to the NHS, she had a change of heart when she found out she was having a girl. She had asked for a second opinion after using a home scan kit which said she was expecting a girl. Central defender Curis Davies, 29, from Leytonstone, London, was signed by Hull City from Birmingham City in 2013 for £2,250,000. In May 2014, he was named as Player of The Year. The 6ft 2in star has also played for Leicester, Aston Villa, West Bromwich Albion and Luton Town, where he began his career in 2003. Davies represented England under-21s for the first time in February 2006 and went on to be capped three times at that level. He was named in Fabio Capello's first provisional England squad. He has since been named in other England squads but has yet to make his full debut. She said: 'I want to enjoy my precious first few moments alone with my daughter and my mum - not share them with the world. 'I've really started looking after myself. I have never purposely put my child at any risk, but when I was originally told I was having a boy I just lost all willpower to avoid cravings. 'I've now cut down to just one or two fags a day. I'm about to get hypnotherapy to stop completely.' Josie became a household name when she admitted undergoing £4,800 worth of breast enhancement surgery paid by the NHS to increase her bust from a 32A to 36DD. She claimed she needed the surgery because she had been bullied since the age of 14 for being flat chested. Later it also emerged that she received Botox on the NHS over a 'sweat problem'. Josie's most controversial outburst came when she publicly considered aborting the child because the pregnancy prevented her from appearing on Channel 5's Big Brother. The mother-of-two later said she was receiving negative attention on public transport and asked the council to provide her with a £6,000-a-year taxi to take her children to school. She made headlines again when she said now wanted a nose job - funded by the public. She set up a website called fundmynose.co.uk to encourage people to donate towards the £3,000 cosmetic operation. She claimed she was fed up of people comparing her to The Muppets’ Miss Piggy and now wants a brand new nose which is a ‘cross between Michelle Keegan and Jennifer Aniston’. It comes after the former escort, who previously worked a stint as a £1,000-a-night prostitute, told female students 'not to worry' if their exam results were not quite what they were hoping for. As A-level exam results this month, she tweeted: 'Good luck to everyone getting your A-level results today. Girls don't worry if ur results are poor - you can always (cont).

"McDonald's doesn't think its employees should eat the food they serve. The fast food giant has advised employees to avoid meals with burgers and fries and to eat healthier options like salad and sandwiches. The advice was dispensed on the now-infamous McResource Line, the employees-only website that has told workers to sell their things and get second jobs to make ends meet. Good idea, bad idea: McDonald's didn't think its employees should eat the food they serve, as seen in this graph from their staff website McResource Line, which was pulled down this week . The advice is given with graphics depicting the ‘unhealthy choice’ and the ‘healthier choice.’ McDonald’s own food is in the former column. Despite featuring a vast array of deep fried delicacies, the Golden Arches reminds employees that ‘avoiding items that are deep fried are your best bet.’ The sensible advice also tells McWorkers to ‘limit the extras such as cheese, bacon and mayonnaise.’ Tasty add-ons that are staples of many menu items they serve on a daily basis. A hamburger, fries and soda are warned against, because ‘eating a diet high in fat puts people at rick for becoming overweight.’ Many locations offer steep food discounts and short breaks to employees, virtually forcing them to eat the unhealthy food, often forcing the hand of workers without the time or means to eat elsewhere. Solid advice: Don't eat at McDonald's. The fast food chain were forced to admit the embarrassing and 'outdated' information on their site has lead to a temporarily shutdown for 'upgrades' ‘It is hard to eat a healthy diet when you eat at fast-food restaurants often,’ the advice continues. ‘Many foods are cooked with a lot of fat, even if they are not trans fats. Many fast-food restaurants do not offer any lower-fat foods.’ The world’s largest fast food chain wants employees to eat elsewhere. ‘Eat at places that offer a variety of salads, soups, and vegetables,’ the site says. This advice comes after a series of tips telling employees find second jobs, apply for food stamps and sell their things to weather a financial crisis. The site also gave advice on how to tip au pairs, doormen, personal trainers and pool boys. A spokesperson told CNBC that the website has been ‘taken entirely out of context.'","The same website that told employees to apply for food stamps, pawn their things and find second jobs is at it again .

"A dream beach house in Florida has turned into a nightmare for a Missouri couple after the $680,000, five-bedroom home was built on the wrong lot. Six months after the custom house was built along the Atlantic Ocean near Palm Coast,   Mark and Brenda Voss learned it's on the wrong lot in the gated Ocean Hammock community. Mark Voss tells the Daytona Beach News Journal they're in 'total disbelief.' Scroll down for video . Custom-made disaster: Six months after their custom house was built along the Atlantic Ocean near Palm Coast, owners Mark and Brenda Voss learned it's on the wrong lot in the gated Ocean Hammock community . Big, misplaced house: The Florida dream home boasts five bedrooms and over 5,000 square feet of living space . 'We may have moved (to Ocean Hammock) someday. But, with this headache and grief, we're not so sure. The Midwest is looking pretty good right now,' he said. The couple own 18 other residential lots in the community, but the mistake managed to be made on a lot owned by someone else. They bought the lot in 2012 for $160,000 and hired Keystone Homes to build a three-story, 5,000-square-foot vacation rental. The other lot was purchased for $355,000 by a North Carolina couple way back in 2003. Keystone and Voss say the error can be traced to a 2013 survey. The mistake was uncovered in September after the house had been rented frequently. Tough mistake to make: While the Voss family own over a dozen lots in the Ocean Hammock community, the builders managed to build on one owned by another couple--one that cost a great deal more . In June 2012 the Vosses purchased the lot of 23 Ocean Ridge Blvd for $160,000. They then commissioned Keystone Homes to build the 5,000 square-foot home to be used as a vacation rental but the contractors mistakenly began construction next door at 21 Ocean Ridge Blvd. North. Andrew Massaro and his wife Brooke Triplett, who live in Ocean Isle Beach, North Carolina purchased that lot in 2003 for $355,000, but never built their own property there. Keystone claim the mistake is down to a land survey conducted last year when a simple mistake led to the wrong lot being assessed. Mark Boyce, who is Flagler County's chief building official, told The Ledger in Florida that the mistake, though regretable, is understandable. He says the west side of Ocean Ridge Blvd North has a long stretch of around 10 vacant lots all with short grass, with no clear landmarks or markers for builders or surveyors. Keystone vice president Robbie Richmond says the company is trying to negotiate a settlement. The couple hired a lawyer. 'We are in the process of trying to schedule a conference call and find a fair resolution without the lawyers,' Richmond said. 'I have built about 600 homes in Flagler County and this has never happened to me before. It does happen, but it's rare.' We are 100 percent committed to finding a resolution that is fair,' he said. What that resolution will be remains to be seen. Richmond thinks the best solution would be for the owners to switch lot, but Voss sounds as if he could be open to other fixes. 'We have some ideas and plans, but I'm not going to discuss them here,' Voss said. 'We're working all channels to deal with this. We have an attorney.'","Mark and Brenda Voss learned their 3-story vacation home in Ocean Hammock, Florida was misplaced six months after it was completed .

"Parents in a Pennsylvania school district are turning 50 shades of red over word search puzzles given to their middle school students based on an erotic novel and movie.

"The British nurse who survived Ebola has returned to the country where he caught the infection. William Pooley said he was 'delighted' to go back to Sierra Leone in West Africa as he attempts to prevent 'as many unnecessary deaths as possible'. The 29-year-old arrived in the capital Freetown yesterday and will now resume work in an Ebola isolation unit run by UK medical staff. Mr Pooley became the first confirmed Briton to contract Ebola and was flown back to the UK in August, where he was treated at the Royal Free Hospital in London. He said: 'I am delighted to be returning to Sierra Leone. Scroll down for video . William Pooley (left), the British nurse who survived Ebola, has returned to Sierra Leone to continue treating victims of the epidemic. Today he met the International Development Secretary Justine Greening (second left) who is visiting the country to see how Britain's £125 million assistance package is helping . Mr Pooley became the first confirmed Briton to contract Ebola and was flown back to the UK in August, where he was treated at the Royal Free Hospital in London. He said: 'I am delighted to be returning to Sierra Leone . 'I would like to once again thank the team at the Royal Free Hospital and the RAF who provided me with such excellent treatment and support. 'But the real emergency is in West Africa, and the teams out there need all the support we can give them. 'I am now looking forward to getting back out there and doing all I can to prevent as many unnecessary deaths as possible.' More than 4,500 people are confirmed to have been killed by Ebola in West Africa this year, though its spread beyond the three worst affected countries of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone has been brought under control. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has estimated that the coming months could bring about 10,000 new cases per week. Mr Pooley will be working in the isolation unit at Connaught Hospital where he will train local staff and help to set up new isolation units, after previously treating patients in a government hospital in Kenema. Mr Pooley was treated with the experimental drug ZMapp and left hospital on September 3 after making a full recovery. Last week he said he was preparing to return to West Africa to help deal with the Ebola epidemic because it is 'something I need to do'. Mr Pooley was treated with the experimental drug ZMapp and left hospital on September 3 after making a full recovery . Speaking in Whitehall in central London, the nurse said he knew his family and friends would be worried but they should be reassured by his potential immunity to the virus. 'There is still a lot of work to do out there and I am in the same or better position than when I chose to go out before,' Mr Pooley said. 'I know my mum and dad are worried but they support me because they know this is something I have to do. 'My potential immunity is very reassuring for them, or at least it should be, and I will be returning in a more organised fashion than when I was out there originally.' Last month Mr Pooley, from Eyke in Suffolk, reportedly flew to the US to undergo a blood transfusion to help an American being treated for the virus. He will join the King's Health Partners team, a partnership between King's College London and three NHS trusts - Guy's and St Thomas', King's College Hospital and South London and Maudsley. Dr Oliver Johnson, programme director for the King's Sierra Leone Partnership, said: 'It is fantastic that Will has chosen to join our small team here at Connaught Hospital. 'The situation here in Freetown is getting worse by the day and so Will's experience and commitment will be vital as we do everything we can to stem the flow of cases. 'The best way of stopping Ebola spreading even further is to fight it at its source and I look forward to working with Will to do just that.' It comes after a Spanish nursing assistant who became the first person to contract Ebola outside Africa was found to be clear of all traces of the virus. A blood test has revealed that Teresa Romero's immune system has eliminated the infection from her body, according to a statement released by Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's office. More than 4,500 people have died from Ebola, mainly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Britain's latest Ebola aid flight carrying vital medical supplies landed in Freetown on Saturday, International Development Secretary Justine Greening said. A man suffering from Ebola virus lies on the floor outside a house in Port Loko Community, situated on the outskirts of Freetown, Sierra Leone. So far the epidemic has claimed more than 4,500 lives . It was the UK's sixth aid flight and carried almost £900,000 worth of medical equipment needed for the 92 bed treatment facility in Kerry Town, including blood banks, centrifuges and protective equipment such as goggles and gloves. The UK, which has committed £125 million to tackling Ebola, has put pressure on other wealthy countries to do more to combat the spread of the virus. The Prime Minister has written to European Union leaders calling for them to double their contribution to one billion euro (£800 million) this week. Today the International Development Secretary Justine Greening met Mr Pooley in Sierra Leone. Ms Greening is on a two-day visit to see how Britain's £125 million assistance package is helping the country. She will visit the site of a 92-bed Ebola treatment facility in Kerry Town, which is in the final stages of being constructed by British humanitarian and military experts, with the assistance of local contractors. Ms Greening is on a two-day visit to see how Britain's £125 million assistance package is helping the country . She will also visit an Ebola Training Academy for healthcare workers, funded by the Department for International Development. Also today, UK-funded pick-up trucks which will be used in the Sierra Leone aid effort were loaded aboard the Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship Argus at a British naval base in Gibraltar. The 32 vehicles were lifted on to the deck of the ship where they will remain until it reaches Freetown later next week. The trucks will be used to transport staff, medicines and equipment around the country. Ms Greening said: 'These vehicles will be vital to keep Ebola treatment centres running across the country. From transporting medical supplies to ensuring treatment centres are well stocked with protective clothing, they will help increase capacity and capability as we work to control and defeat Ebola in Sierra Leone. There are more than 300 UK military personnel in Sierra Leone from all three services - Army, Navy and RAF - comprised of medics, engineers, logisticians and planners, and the figure will rise to around 750 personnel by the end of the month. Ebola situation is 'much worse' than before and being hindered by a lack of beds and lab facilities . A Welsh doctor who has returned to Liberia to treat victims of Ebola says the situation is 'much worse' than her first trip to the country in the summer. Dr Nathalie MacDermott, from Cardiff, who has been back in Liberia since October 10, said though more aid agency workers are on the ground, there are not 'many more treatment facilities' and there remains a 'huge need for beds'. Dr Nathalie MacDermott, from Cardiff, who has returned to Liberia for a second time, said the situation is much worse in terms of the scale of the epidemic and needs to be urgently addressed . The medic, who went through a self-imposed three-week quarantine following her first trip because the disease has a 21-day incubation period, said: 'We are working flat out and we do need more Western medics to volunteer. 'Right now we also particularly need more laboratory facilities.' She described conditions in the West African country as 'challenging' and said she has made some 'very difficult medical decisions' while treating patients. Before leaving for her second trip she told the BBC she would find it difficult to turn away desperately ill patients knowing they would die, but was involved in a battle against an epidemic and could do only 'small things at the beginning'. She told WalesOnline: 'The situation is much worse in terms of the scale of the epidemic and a lot needs to be done urgently to address this. 'We are struggling a lot with logistical constraints and the unavailability of laboratory testing, which has been promised by many organisations - but few have delivered on this promise in Liberia as yet.' Dr MacDermott believes poverty is the root cause of the crisis. She explained she went to the country because she 'couldn't sit and watch people dying without trying to help' Working for relief organisation Samaritan's Purse, she is developing 15 Ebola community care centres around Liberia. She explained she went to the country because she 'couldn't sit and watch people dying without trying to help'. Despite suggestions deforestation linked to illegal logging is to blame by unleashing Ebola-infected fruit bats into contact with people, Dr MacDermott believes poverty is the root cause of the crisis. She said: 'If you have nothing to feed your family on and you come across a dead monkey in the forest, it will feed your family for many days. 'If you know nothing about Ebola and your children are hungry you do whatever it takes to feed them and keep them healthy. 'If we are looking for a root cause to address it needs to be poverty and the significantly poor infrastructures of these three countries which has enabled this epidemic to reach the levels it has.'","William Pooley has returned to Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone .

"The launch of a Russian rocket carrying an American communications satellite ended in disaster today after it plunged into the sea 40 seconds after blast-off. Grainy footage of the launch being streamed online was cut shortly after 6.56am GMT when the space-bound vessel got into trouble. The Swiss-based Sea Launch company sent up their Zenit-3SL rocket from the Odyssey Launch Platform in the Pacific Ocean on Friday. Scroll down for video . Disaster: The Russian rocket Zenit-3SL was launched from the Sea Launch pad in the Pacific today but crashed 40 seconds later (file pic) However, the vessel – along with its . Intelsat 27 telecommunications satellite inside - suffered a failure . during the first stage of its flight. It is claimed the rocket’s engines shut off stopped automatically because its trajectory was wrong. Odyssey sits on the equator and is a launch pad made from a converted oil rig. A team control its flight from a boat six kilometres away. A team is now searching for the downed rocket.. The first section of the rocket was scheduled to separate after 2 minutes 30 seconds, and it is understood there was an error in that period. Sea Launch said in a statement: 'Approximately 40 seconds after . liftoff of the launch of the Intelsat 27 spacecraft, all telemetry was . lost indicating a loss of mission'. Hitch: A team is now searching for the Zenit-3SL - which looks similar to the Zenit 3F, shown blasting off from the Russian leased Kazakhstan Baikonur cosmodrome in 2011 . Company president Kjell Karlsen added: 'We are very disappointed with the outcome of the launch and offer our sincere regrets to our customer, Intelsat, and their spacecraft provider, BSSI. 'We will do everything reasonably possible to recover from this unexpected and unfortunate event.' It is another knock to the reputation of Russia’s space industry as two years ago a communications satellite fell to the ground soon after it was launched. The Meridian satellite, which was for military and civilian use, did not reach its orbit and fell to the ground near the city of Tobolsk in Siberia, about 1,400 miles from Moscow. Sources blamed the accident on the carrier rocket's failure, and it appears the same may have happened again.",Zenit-3SL got into trouble after it was sent towards space from the Sea Launch platform on the equator .

"Rapper Kanye West's debut as a designer at New York Fashion Week may have gone over well with his most devoted fans - but a number of the industry's elite have spoken out to slam the collection, labeling the musician's first foray onto the runway as a 'joke' and a 'disaster'. Shortly after the 37-year-old's collaboration with sportswear brand Adidas Originals was showcased at a star-studded catwalk show in Manhattan on Friday, Fashion Week creator Fern Mallis revealed to the New York Post that she is 'over' the musician, adding that his general agenda is 'not her style'. 'I’m kind of over Kanye,' she said. “I mean, I’m not a fan of his music, and the attitude and the agenda is not my style.' Scroll down for video . Design debut: Kanye West showcased his first collection for Adidas Originals at New York Fashion Week on Friday . What a joke! Both Fashion Week creator Fern Mallis and fashion publicist Kelly Cutrone slammed Kanye's catwalk show . And the fashion veteran isn't alone in her opinions. Renowned fashion publicist Kelly Cutrone, who is known by many for her appearance on Lauren Conrad's LA-based reality series The Hills, also offered up a harsh critique of Kanye's design attempts, while suggesting that the father-of-one should stick to music and avoid any other fashion-focused ventures. 'I’m not into his fashion thing,' she told People magazine. 'I think he’s fine as a rapper. I think he’s a joke as a fashion designer. 'I just think that you should stay focused at what you’re good at. Just because you’re a good rapper doesn’t mean you’re going to be a good fashion designer.' Nice try! Kanye's questionable fashion fail has already started to spawn its own collection of entertaining memes, including this one which features designer Ralph Lauren . Kelly was also quick to point out that this is not the first time Kanye's attempts to establish himself as a legitimate designer have failed. 'I mean, it’s not, he’s not legit. Have you seen the product?' she said. 'Didn’t he have his own line in London, which was a disaster that he spent $10 million to do, that no one wore?' And it seems that plenty of would-be fashion critics on Twitter also share Kelly's somewhat blunt opinion of Kanye's bizarre collection, which featured a series of unflattering ensembles, including skin-tight nude body stockings which were paired with flesh-colored crop tops. 'I'm no fashion guru but I feel like Kanye is the 2015 version of ""The Emperor's new clothes.""' one Twitter user wrote, while another added: 'I can't believe people are actually buying ripped clothing just bc kanye designed them. Bruh give me your clothes & I'll rip them for free.' Unimpressed: Despite claiming to be incredibly excited at the prospect of showing his Adidas Originals collection, Kanye failed to raise a smile when he took to the catwalk .

"Samantha Cameron looked to be showing support for the England team on the eve of the World Cup last night. She led the way in a bold A-line dress in white and red - the colours of the English flag - for a glamorous date night. She even had a blue blazer slung over her arm, just like our footballing legends might do - though we're not sure if Samantha Cameron's was emblazoned with the three lions. The Prime Minister, meanwhile, trailed behind in his trusty navy suit and blue shirt combo as the couple exited high-profile night spot the Chiltern Firehouse. David Cameron and wife Samantha exit trendy eatery The Chiltern Firehouse via the back door last night . Their visit to the restaurant is thought to be their latest 'date night', which they do at least once a week . Sam was well ahead of the colour trend with three days to go until England's first World Cup match on Saturday. The couple's choice of venue was somewhat of a step up for Cameron, who has recently been spotted dining at Pizza Express and Nandos. They were pictured leaving celebrity hotspot the Chiltern Firehouse in Mrylebone London after spending some quality time together away from the hustle and bustle of Westminster and their children. The couple were not the only famous faces partying in the venue, U2's Bono and The Edge - real name David Evans - were also seen heading for a meal. They were joined by model Laura Bailey, The Wolf of Wall Street star Margot Robbie, socialite Lady Victoria Hervey and actress Lindsay Lohan. But Cameron and his wife seemed keen to hide their following of London's in-crowd, and left via the building's back entrance following their evening together. The couple are the latest high-profile figures to be seen at the venue, which boasts David Beckham and Lily Allen among its regulars .

"Criminals are using the online small ads site Gumtree, which allows people to sell everything from cars to mobile phones and even pets, to steal millions of pounds from innocent consumers. Citizens Advice is issuing a warning today after revealing that one in six of the consumer problems it has investigated associated with Gumtree was a scam or potential scam. Police are receiving around 250 crime and fraud allegations a week that are connected to the site, some of which involve serious thefts and assault. Criminals are using the online small ads site Gumtree, which allows people to sell everything from cars to mobile phones and even pets, to steal millions of pounds from innocent consumers . And figures from the National Fraud Intelligence Bureaux reveal online shopping and auction scams were the most common fraud reported in 2013, costing UK consumers £63.6 million. Gumtree is particularly vulnerable because the website does not vet or take identification details from its users, which means it can be used time and again by criminals who are difficult to trace. The website is owned by eBay, which does have ID checking but is also vulnerable to criminal scams, according to research by Citizens Advice. It said one in ten problems it has looked at associated with eBay was a scam or potential scam. The watchdog gave the example of a flat hunter who saw a property advertised on Gumtree and handed over £1,650 to the person he thought was the landlord. However, when he tried to move in, someone else was already living there. In another case a man bought a car on eBay for £360 and spent another £700 on repairs, however it was then repossessed because the previous owner had failed to pay off an outstanding loan. However, this is just the tip of the iceberg and there is evidence from a large and growing number of court cases and police reports that criminals use Gumtree to: . Citizens Advice looked at problems reported to its offices in the six months to the end of March which concerned products or services bought through Gumtree and eBay. There were 649 cases related to Gumtree and 3,711 to eBay. Victims of online crime are invited to report the case to Action Fraud, which collects the details and passes some of them on to local police forces. However, this regime has fallen into disrepute because many victims, some of whom have lost huge sums, are never contacted by the police. The chief executive of Citizens Advice, Gillian Guy, said: ‘Online marketplaces are at risk of becoming a hotbed for scams. ‘These sites are an important service for buyers and sellers, but con artists are profiting from them too.  Scammers are swindling people out of out of hundreds or thousands of pounds by posting false products and services online. ‘Con artists are preying on those still trying to get back on their feet from the recession. Fake jobs and phoney homes are taking people’s deposits that they strived and saved so long for. ‘Businesses need to get savvy to these spurious practices and take steps to stop consumers falling foul of scams. Gumtree is particularly vulnerable because the website does not vet or take identification details from its users, which means it can be used time and again by criminals who are difficult to trace . ‘It’s time for online marketplaces to up their game and do more to protect their customers from dodgy dealings by strongly policing their websites, carrying out spot checks and immediately removing any risky ads.’ Gumtree said: ‘We do everything in our power to keep scammers off our site and encourage anyone that has fallen for a scam, to report it to us and the police. ‘Gumtree is an open platform which provides a free and easy way to buy and sell, meaning we do not track user information. We are always looking at new ways to improve customer safety such as improving methods of communication between us and our customers. ‘We encourage all our users to adhere to our safety tips on the site and discourage people from transferring any money in advance of seeing an item for sale.’ eBay questioned the validity of the research. It said that the 371 cases examined by Citizens Advice should be put in the context of the fact the UK version of the auction site receives 19million visitors each month. It said: ‘eBay invests millions of pounds each year doing just what the Citizens Advice Bureau recommends: strongly policing our website, carrying out spot checks and immediately removing any risky ads.  Customers who purchase on eBay are covered by the eBay Money Back Guarantee and get the item they ordered, or their money back.’","Citizens Advice revealed that one in six of the consumer problems it has .

"A shocking YouTube video released by World Animal Protection is trying to convince tourists not to book wild animal experiences such as elephant rides the next time they are on holiday. With many tourists unaware of what goes on behind the scenes, the fake advertisement is part of a global campaign to bring awareness to the abuse and torture suffered by enslaved elephants, tigers and other animals. The video starts with an actress welcoming viewers to 'Authentic Elephant Rides', a non-existent tourist attraction, before describing the horrific ways elephants are tamed so they can be ridden by tourists. Ugly truth: 'Elephants won't naturally let people ride on them so to tame them they are tortured' The woman plays the role of an 'Authentic Elephant Rides' employee, telling viewers: 'Elephants won't naturally let people ride on top of them so in order to tame them - and to give tourists that extra special experience - they are tortured from a very early age to completely break their spirit. 'The process is called phajaan  or ""the crush"" while ripping them away from their mother and confining them to very small spaces - like this.' The presenter then points to minuscule pen complete with chains. She adds: 'The elephants are beaten into submission with clubs and bull hooks. It is the fear of being stabbed which is used to motivate them to work. The tip has to be really sharp to make sure it pierces the elephant's thick skin. Torture: The end of the video shows a clearly distressed elephant chained to a tree trying to free itself . 'And of course they are simultaneously starved and deprived of sleep for days on end. There is no other way to ride an elephant.' The clip ends with footage of a clearly distressed elephant desperately trying to free itself as it is shackled to a tree with a saddle and chair strapped to its back.

"The discovery of Martian clusters, known as ‘blueberries’, a decade ago provided some of the first evidence of liquid water on the red planet. This incredible close up, taken by the Mars Rover Opportunity, reveals these spheres embedded in Martian rock like blueberries in a muffin. The image is part of an exhibition by the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum presenting more than 50 of the best photographs from two rovers known as Spirit and Opportunity. These hematite-rich spherules were embedded in this Martian rock like blueberries in a muffin and released over time by erosion. The Mars Rover Opportunity found this cluster at its Eagle Crater landing site and analysed their composition with its spectrometers. Hypotheses about their formation have contributed to the story of water on Mars . Ten years after Nasa landed the two rovers on Mars for a 90-day mission, one is still exploring, and the project has generated hundreds of thousands of images from the planet's surface. The Mars Rover Opportunity found this 'blueberry' cluster at its Eagle Crater landing site and analysed the composition with its spectrometers. Previous theories suggested they were created by simple chemical reactions without the help of life. However, research last year revealed clear evidence that microbes were essential in their formation. This raised the possibility that Martian . ‘blueberries’ may not only reveal that water was present on Mars - but . also ancient microbial life. A view by the Mars Rover Spirit of a sunset over the rim of Gusev Crater, about 80 km (50 miles) away. Taken from Husband Hill, it looks much like a sunset on Earth, a reminder that other worlds can seem eerily familiar. Sunset and twilight images help scientists to determine how high into the atmosphere the Martian dust extends and to look for dust or ice clouds . ‘Spirit and Opportunity: 10 Years Roving Across Mars’, curated by the scientists who have led the mission, opens tomorrow in Washington. Along with unusual ‘blueberry’ clusters, it includes large-scale photographs of craters, hills, dunes, dust clouds, meteorites, rock formations and the Martian sunset. John Grant, a planetary geologist at the museum who is part of the rover mission team, organised the exhibition, in part as a travel log with images on one side from Sprit and images from Opportunity on the other. The rovers landed in January 2004 on opposite sides of Mars and began exploring volcanic deposits and plains, as well as meteorites and impact craters. Rover tracks are shown disappearing toward the horizon in a sea of sand between the craters Endurance and Victoria on the Meridiani Plains. Mars rover Opportunity took the image while stuck in the sand ripple, dubbed Purgatory, for over a month . A wheel that was used to test the Mars Exploration Rovers on Earth before their mission is also on display. After about 800 days, one of Spirit's front wheels stalled and stopped functioning. The engineering team decided to continue driving it in reverse, dragging the broken wheel across the Martian surface . ‘Every one of the images you see here tells a story of discovery that goes along with the story of beauty on Mars,’ Dr Grant said. ‘It's a look at an alien planet through the rovers' eyes.’ Uncovering signs of the past presence of water and a more habitable environment are among the rovers' most important discoveries. Some were made by accident. After about 800 days, one of Spirit's front wheels stalled and stopped functioning. The engineering team decided to continue driving it in reverse, dragging the broken wheel across the Martian surface. That dragging dug a trench behind the rover that soon uncovered a new material as white as snow. This piece of metal with the American flag on it is made of aluminum recovered from the site of the World Trade Center towers in New York City. It is located on Mars Rover Spirit and serves as a cable guard for Spirit, a­s a rock abrasion tool as well as a memorial to the victims of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Mars Rover Opportunity has an identical piece . Cornell University Astronomy Professor Steve Squyres (right) and NasaPlanetary Science Division Director Jim Green (left) look at the 'Spirit and Opportunity: 10 Years Roving Across Mars' It turned out to be silica material that would normally be found in hot springs and hydrothermal systems - habitable environments. ‘It was a total surprise,’ said Steven Squyres, an astronomy professor at Cornell University who headed the Mars Exploration Rover mission. ‘It was just pure good luck. We wouldn't have even seen that if we didn't have the busted wheel.’ The rovers also found concretions and layered sedimentary rocks made of sulphate salt that showed water had once been on the planet's surface. While some panoramic images clearly show the red Martian landscape, other images focus on other colours that can be found in Mars' rocks, soil and sky. One image of the Martian sunset shows a bluish colour in the sky, which is usually pink in the daytime due to the reddish dust in the atmosphere. It turns blue at sunset - the opposite of Earth, Professor Squyres said. Jim Green, Nasa director of planetary science, said the rovers have made huge strides in learning about Mars to eventually send humans there. The Curiosity rover is also now exploring the surface of the red planet, and Nasa plans to send more rovers before humans.

"William the Conqueror: Dr Mari Jones, a leading linguist from Cambridge University, is attempting to preserve the language for the benefit of future generations . The race is on to chronicle the Norman language before it slips into extinction. A Cambridge University linguist is now studying the dialects of the Channel Islands - one of the last enclaves of Norman French - to ensure it is recorded for posterity. Native dialects of the language spoken by William the Conquerer are still used by around 3,000 people on the islands. On Sark they are estimated to number 20, on Guernsey 1,000 and on Jersey 2,000. The dialects on all three islands are distinct. The language - which is also used in parts of Normandy - is now not spoken fluently by anyone under the age of 30 and is expected to disappear within a generation. Dr Mari Jones, a leading linguist from Cambridge University, is attempting to preserve the language for the benefit of future generations. She told MailOnline: 'Language often carries a symbolic force, as an emblem of groupness, a focus of ethnic allegiance and belonging, on a par with other symbols such as a flag or a national anthem. 'This is not work that we can leave until a metaphorical tomorrow: unless considerable support is given to those people working to maintain and preserve the Norman French of the Channel Islands, it will disappear within the next few decades.' The Norman language has been spoken in the Channel Islands for hundreds of years but began declining in medieval times with the stationing of garrisons of English soldiers in Guernsey and Jersey. Jèrriais (Jersey Norman French) Guernésiais (Guernsey Norman French) Sercquais (Sark Norman French) Auregnais (Alderney Norman French ) (this dialect became extinct in around the 1950s) The decline was exacerbated in the 19th century when trade with England increased dramatically with the arrival of steamships. This, combined with a growing number of tourists, led to English being seen as a means to prosperity and social advancement. A further blow to the language was the German Occupation of the islands in World War II. Dr Jones said this led to the evacuation to the UK of large numbers of women and children, the next generation of Norman speakers. 'Five years in the life of a child is a long time, so when they went back they had started to forget Norman French,' she said. Gorey Harbour, Jersey: Experts say the island's Norman French dialect could die out within a generation . In Jersey the endangered Norman . dialect, known as Jersey French, is now spoken by just 3.2 per cent of . the population (an estimated  2,000 people), and in Guernsey their version is spoken . by just 2.2 per cent (an estimated 1,000 people). The Unesco Atlas of the World's . Languages in Danger states that 230 languages reached extinction in the . past 60 years, and some 3,000 languages are currently endangered. The name Normandy came because the Vikings were known as 'North men' and the language that evolved was known as Norman . The origins of the language in the Channel Islands come from the Romans after they finally conquered all of Gaul (modern-day France) - as well as the Islands - under Julius Caesar in 51BC. The language spoken at that time was known as 'Vulgar Latin' ('of the people'). Then, during the ninth and 10th century Vikings began to sweep south from northern Europe for frequent marauding raids along the northern coast of France. Fed up with the constant harassment, the king of the Francs gave them an area of land which is now modern-day Normandy - and included the Channel Islands. The name Normandy came because the Vikings were known as 'North men' and the language that evolved was known as Norman. The language 'Norman' then came to British shores with William the Conqueror when he set foot on Pevensey Bay in September 1066. From then on it was the language of the aristocracy and other social classes seeking advancement, and is now known as 'Anglo-Norman'. It retained its status until the early 15th century when it mysteriously dropped from use. Dr Mari Jones of Cambridge University said no-one knows why this was but it could have been because most ordinary people carried on speaking English, whereas 'Anglo-Norman' was only spoken by the aristocracy and written down. There is one last Norman phrase still in use in Britain to this day. When a Bill has been passed by the House of Commons and the House of Lords it is given Royal Assent - which means the Queen formally approves it - and the phrase 'la Reyne le veult' (the Queen so wills it) is used.

"A beer-pouring robot that can read your body movements and anticipate when you want another drink has been developed by American students. Researchers from Cornell University used Microsoft Kinect sensors and 3D cameras to help the robot analyse its surroundings and identify its owner's needs. The robot then uses a database of videos showing 120 various household tasks to identify nearby objects, generate a set of possible outcomes and choose which action it should take - without being told. Scroll down for video . A robot developed by researchers from Cornell University uses Kinect sensors, 3D cameras and a database of household task videos to anticipate their owner's needs. For example, it scans the surrounding area for clues and when it spots an empty beer bottle, can open the fridge, pick up a full bottle of beer and hand it to its owner . The Cornell robot uses sensors and a 3D camera to analyse the depth of . its surroundings (left). The view seen by the robot in the . right-hand picture shows how it anticipates its owner's actions. It . compares the actions against a database of household task videos and . chooses what it thinks is the most appropriate response. The . more actions the robot carries out, the more accurate its decisions . become . Festival-goers . in South Africa this summer will be able to order beer from their . smartphones and have it delivered by a flying drone dropping a can . attached to a parachute. The . drone has been developed by Darkwing Aerials and will be tested at the . Oppikoppi music festival in the Limpopo province of South Africa this . August. Customers will . be able to place their drink orders through an iOS app that will send . their GPS coordinates to the drone operators. As the actions continue, the robot can constantly update and refine its predictions. As well as fetching drinks for thirsty owners, the robot can also work out when its owner is hungry and put food in a microwave, tidy up, make cereal, fetch a toothbrush and toothpaste, open fridge doors and more. Ashutosh Saxena, Cornell's professor of computer science and . co-author of a new study tied to the research: 'We extract the general . principles of how people behave. 'Drinking coffee is a big activity, but there are several parts to it. 'The robot builds a 'vocabulary' of such small parts that it can put . together in various ways to recognise a variety of big activities.' The Cornell robot can also help its owner tidy up. In this image, the robot scanned the area and noticed that its owner was carrying a pot of food and heading towards the fridge. The robot then automatically opened the fridge door. During tests, the robot made correct predictions 82% of the time when looking one second into the future, 71% correct for three seconds and 57% correct for 10 seconds . The robot was initially programmed to refill a person’s cup when it was nearly empty. To do this the robot had to plan its movements in advance and then follow this plan. But if a human sitting at the table happens to raise the cup and drink from it, the robot was put off and could end up pouring the drink into a cup that isn’t there. After extra programming the robot was updated so that when it sees the human reaching for the cup, it can anticipate the human action and avoid making a mistake. During tests, the robot made correct . predictions 82 per cent of the time when looking one second into the . future, 71 per cent correct for three seconds and 57 per cent correct for . 10 seconds. This image shows the robot anticipating its owner walking towards a fridge and automatically opens the fridge door for him. The first three images show the robot's view, the fourth is from the view of the owner . 'Even though humans are . predictable, they are only predictable part of the time,' Saxena said. 'The future would be to figure out how the robot plans its action. Right . now we are almost hard-coding the responses, but there should be a way . for the robot to learn how to respond.' Saxena and Cornell graduate student Hema S. Koppula will they present their research at the June International Conference of Machine Learning in Atlanta. They will also demonstrate the robot at the Robotics: Science and Systems conference in Berlin, Germany, also in June.","The robot, developed at Cornell University, uses Kinect sensors, 3D cameras and a database of videos to work out what its owner wants .

"Judging by this raunchiest of rumbas, this might have been the moment when the Curse of Strictly struck again. Ben Cohen and Kristina Rihanoff got the judges hot under the collar as they gyrated their way through the steamy routine in the third week of last year’s show. Indeed their chemistry was so apparent in their performance of the ‘dance of love’ that presenter Tess Daly commented: ‘We can all feel the love after that one.’ Speculation is rife that the dance was a turning point in the former England rugby star’s increasingly intimate friendship with Ms Rihanoff – and his marriage to his wife of 11 years . Although they were eliminated in the ninth week of the show, the pair have continued their friendship . Now speculation is rife that the dance was a turning point in the former England rugby star’s increasingly intimate friendship with Ms Rihanoff – and his marriage to his wife of 11 years. On Wednesday Cohen announced he had separated from Abby, 36, the mother of his twin girls, Harriette and Isabelle, six. Cohen has already revealed that she was forced to flee rehearsals in the days leading up to the show after walking in on him and Ms Rihanoff in a passionate embrace as part of their practice. Although they were eliminated in the ninth week of the show, the pair have continued to maintain their friendship. In January, months after they left the BBC programme, a fan tweeted a picture of them walking down the street with the caption: ‘These two go everywhere together!! Lol’. To which the Siberian-born dancer replied: ‘Ha! No I don’t go to the gym with him! Lol’. Ben Cohen, 36, announced he was separating from his wife Abby (pictured) days after a picture emerged of him with his arm around Ms Rihanoff on a train . They have often exchanged messages on Twitter and supported each other’s charity events. While Mrs Cohen was included in earlier online conversations, the two women have not talked to each other on the site for months. Ms Rihanoff’s rumba with Cohen scored straight sevens from the judges. Darcey Bussell said: ‘You created a true intensity between both of you, fabulous.’ Bruno Tonioli added: ‘That was really a touchy feely kind of love.’ Cohen, 36, announced he was separating from his wife days after a picture emerged of him with his arm around Ms Rihanoff on a train. Lawyers for the couple said in a statement: ‘There is no third party involved, and Ben and Abby now ask that their privacy and that of their family be respected at this difficult time.’","Ben Cohen and Kristina Rihanoff had a raunchy dance in Strictly .

"Joe Pearce couldn't afford to rent after break-up from girlfriend . A student who couldn't afford to pay rent bought a boat to live on while studying at university - and saved himself £5,600. Physical geography student, Joe Pearce, 23, bought the 42-year-old yacht online for £800, the equivalent of two months' rent. He lived aboard the 23-foot Falmouth Gypsy class boat in a boatyard for 14 months while studying for his masters at Aberystwyth University. Shipshape: Joe Pearce could not afford to rent so he bought this £800 boat and lived on it while he was studying for his masters degree at Aberystwyth University . Sailor boy: Student Joe bought his yacht Golden Cloud after breaking up with his girlfriend and finding he couldn't afford to rent on his own . Floating home: Joe describes life on his yacht as 'living in a wooden tent' Although sea-worthy, he admitted his yacht, Golden Cloud, had seen better days and described it as a 'wooden tent'. It was built in Penryn, Cornwall, 32 years ago and has a glass fibre hull with a plywood coach roof. Mr Pearce said: 'When I was studying for my masters I realised I couldn't afford to keep living in a flat. I was sharing a flat with my girlfriend, and we would split the £100-a-week rent between us. 'But when we broke up I would have had to pay around 400 pounds a month by myself. So I then came up with a crazy idea to buy a boat to live on.' He bought the boat from the owner in Porthmadog in North Wales. Life at sea: Joe's friends were shocked when they first saw his boats because it was 32 years old and had seen better days . Mind you head: Joe, a physical geography student, saved himself £5,600 while living on his boat for 18 months . He added: 'My friends were excited and I think they were expecting a glamorous yacht - but they were shocked when they saw it. 'It had seen better days and I thought of it as luxury camping, or that I was living in a wooden tent!' The boat had a 1970 engine and the tallest part of the boat was 5ft and Mr Pearce found it difficult to move around as he's almost 6ft. Mr Pearce said: 'I kept it at the Ynyslas boatyard, eight miles outside of Aberystwyth and I would cycle to and from university to save money. 'Everyone at the boatyard was really helpful and helped me fix parts of the boat as I had no DIY experience. It only cost £1 a day to keep it there. 'At times it became cramped and the low ceiling wasn't ideal as I had to crouch down otherwise I would have hit my head. Cosy: At 6ft tall, Joe had to stoop when standing up in the 23ft long yacht, but he has hosted parties on board . Water sport: Joe only had to pay £1 a day to moor a few miles from studying for his masters at Aberystwyth University . Skipper: Joe sailed Golden Cloud back to his parents' home on the Isle of Wight where he is now  renovating the yacht . 'But the boat was the talk of the town and I'd also host boat parties on it.' He graduated last December and has just sailed the 500-miles from North Wales to his home in Totland, Isle of Wight. Mr Pearce said: 'It was so much fun living on the boat - I saved a lot of money and I've still it got it and use it to go fishing around the island. 'It was a fantastic experience and I wouldn't change anything about it. The boat has got so much character and it's officially my boat.' He has secured a river mooring for Golden Cloud, which he is now restoring.","Joe Pearce couldn't afford to rent after break-up from girlfriend .

"Explorer and documentary maker Ben Cropp has set off on a six week mission to find a 500-year-old cannon which could prove for the first time Portuguese sailors were the first to land in Australia in the early 1520s. Mr Cropp, 78, who has more than six decades of diving experience and has discovered over 100 shipwrecks, is searching off the coast of Cooktown in far North Queensland. If the crew find what they are looking for it will re-write Australian history books because the Dutch are now recorded as the first Europeans to visit Australia in 1606. Ben Cropp (above) is on a mission to re-write the history books and find evidence of Portuguese explorers as far back as the early 1520s in Australia . This map from 1542 shows a place called 'Java-la-Grande' (above) which is exactly where Australia is on maps today . Mr Cropp has more than six decades of diving experience and has made more than 150 documentaries on marine life for the National Geographic Channel . Mr Cropp says maps dated from the 1520s show a large sixth continent  in the same position as present-day Australia, called 'Java-la-Grande' in many similar charts and navigational aids. The self-described 'wreck hunter' set off from his base in Cairns on Saturday  on the Freedom IV catamaran. The journey will see him stay off Cooktown in North Queensland for a week before continuing his explorations further north towards the remote Cape York at the tip of the country. He is travelling with four other crew members, including his son Adam Cropp, 31, who is the chief scuba diving guide on National Geographic ships. This is a 500-year-old Spanish map showiing the coast of Australia created by the first explorers . Mr Cropp and his team are on the Freedom IV catamaran for the next six weeks looking for a cannon . Mr Cropp and his crew are searching off the coast of Cooktown, north of Townsville, for the evidence . The film maker and explorer told Daily Mail Australia from out at sea: 'Three Portuguese ships and a Spanish vessel were lost near Cape York in the 1520s before the Dutch arrived. 'I have clues as to where the wrecks might be and we are looking for a cannon which will date it. 'Most historians agree the Portuguese were here first but we have to prove it.' Mr Cropp discovered this anchor at the Ferguson shipwreck in 1977 which sunk in 1841 in the Lockhart River, Queensland . Lynn Cropp captured this cannon at wreckage of The Sun ship in 1985 east of Cape York . 'There was an early chart made in 1522, not released until 1542 and it clearly shows the Cooktown area and shows reefs off the coast. 'It means a lot when something was charted in quite heavy detail and so we know they spent a lot of time here. 'We believe it was a man called Cristovao de Mendonca was one of the first Portuguese men to have charted the coast of Australia in 1522/23 and he would have been the earliest person that we know of. 'We are looking for the absolute proof of Portuguese landing, there are clues but hopefully this voyage will lead to solid evidence. 'The searching is very hard and has already involved lots of swimming, we are looking for things which have been underwater for 500 years old. 'This was 250 years before Cook and appreciate that when Cook's cannons were found they were a metre under the coral. Mr Cropp found these Spanish coins on the wreck of The Sun in 1985 which is east of Cape York on the Ashmore Reef off the coast of Queensland . Mr Cropp and his team will have to spend hours snorkelling looking for historical objects under the coral . 'We are snorkelling in shallow water but we are looking for objects which are probably two metres under the coral.' Mr Cropp, who has produced more than 150 marine documentaries since the 1960s, found the Pandora shipwreck which was 135 miles south east off Cape York in 1977- it is the most historical shipwreck in Australia and that sunk in 1791. 1401: Chinese sailors visit near Darwin . 1451: Dutch documents record the journeys of Indigenous traders from Indonesia to Australia, or as they knew it to ‘Marege’ 1500: Indonesian fishers visit northern Australia, which would last two centuries . 1521: Some historians claim the Portuguese visited Australia during this time, which is what Mr Cropp is seeking to prove. Feb/March 1606: The Dutch East India Company explored the western coast of the Cape York Peninsula. This is the first recorded landfall by a European on Australian soil. 1616-1696: A range of English and Dutch explorers visited different parts of Australia. 1770: Famed English Captain James Cook charted the continent’s east coast in 1770, which later opened the door to British colonisation. He told Daily Mail Australia: 'We have already done a lot of swimming and could not find the cannon that we were looking for. 'IA lot more swimming needs to be done. If we find the cannon I am looking for we can date the period. 'We had other clues, we have ballast rocks- they are the rocks you put in the ship to keep it steady in the water and when a ship is wrecked. We are also have the early maps. 'I am very excited about this trip, it's on my bucket list, I want to find the most important shipwreck in Australia. ''It's likely there were three explorers between 1520 and 1525 that came to Australia but we need positive proof.' Mr Cropp is also on the lookout for other wrecks and said he was going to go back to previous sites he had discovered to check the dating because we could have been on a much older wreck. 'I know the cannon is out there but it is going to be very hard to find. It takes a lot of searching and I am letting the world know this time. I thought I might as well because it is very important.'","Diver and explorer Ben Cropp is on a voyage to find hard evidence of Portuguese sailors being the first Europeans to arrive in Australia in the 1520s .

The 38-page report cited as examples spiked batons and restraint chairs with a desk-like surface in front where arms can be shackled, often with ankle cuffs beneath that force detainees into painful contortions, and neck-and-wrist cuffs connected by a chain. 'There is no excuse whatsoever for allowing the manufacturing and trade in equipment for which the primary purpose is to torture or inflict cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment on people,' Patrick Wicken, security trade and human rights researcher at Amnesty International, said.

Earlier this year, Zhao Chunguang, a national official overseeing police detention facilities, said there had not been a single case of torture used to coerce a confession at any detention centre throughout China for the past five years. Amnesty says it has documented a wide range of physical torture in China, including the use of electric shock batons. And on Monday, the Xinhua News agency reported that a court in northeastern China had convicted three police officers and four other non-police officers of torturing suspects and killing one person.

"Four SLS RS-25 engines will be used to power the world's biggest rocket into orbit. It is set to become the largest rocket ever built, dwarfing the rockets that took man to the moon and paving the way for manned missions to Mars. Nasa today said it is about to start testing the  engines for the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket - on the same stand that were used to perfect the Apollo rockets. Four engines, a modified version of the space shuttle main engine that powered missions into space from 1981 to 2011, will be used on the mega-rocket. 'This test series is a major milestone because it will be our first opportunity to operate the engine with a new controller and to test propellant inlet conditions for SLS that are different than the space shuttle,' said Steve Wofford, SLS Liquid Engines Element manager. Earlier this year Nasa signed a $2.8 billion contract with Boeing to build the giant rocket it is hoped will take us into deep space. 'Our teams have dedicated themselves to ensuring that the Space Launch System (SLS) – the largest ever - will be built safely, affordably and on time,' said Virginia Barnes, Boeing SLS vice president and program manager. 'We are passionate about NASA’s mission to explore deep space. 'It’s a very personal mission, as well as a national mandate.' This milestone marks NASA’s first CDR on a deep-space human exploration launch vehicle since 1961, when the Saturn V rocket underwent a similar design review as the United States sought to land an astronaut on the moon. Scheduled for its initial test flight in 2017, the SLS is designed to be flexible and evolvable to meet a variety of crew and cargo mission needs. The biggest rocket ever made: The SLS will be 384 feet tall and weigh 6.5 million pounds . There will be two versions of the rocket. The smaller, 70-metric-ton SLS will stand 321 feet tall, provide 8.4 million pounds of thrust at liftoff, weigh 5.5 million pounds and carry 154,000 pounds of payload. The massive 130-metric-ton-configuration will be the most capable, powerful launch vehicle in history. Towering a staggering 384 feet tall, it will provide 9.2 million pounds of thrust at liftoff and weigh 6.5 million pounds. It will be able to carry payloads weighing 286,000 pounds to orbit. The initial flight-test configuration will provide a 77-ton capacity, and the final evolved two-stage configuration will provide a lift capability of more than 143 tons. The rocket will be used to ferry astronauts to the International Space Station, and to help us explore the outer reaches of the solar system. 'The potential use of SLS for science will further enhance the synergy between scientific exploration and human exploration,' said John Grunsfeld, astronaut and associate administrator for science at NASA Headquarters in Washington. 'SLS has the promise of enabling transformational science in our exploration of the solar system and cosmos.' Currently under construction, NASA’s Space Launch System will be the world’s most powerful launch vehicle. Designed to enable human exploration missions to deep space destinations, including an asteroid and Mars, SLS is working toward a first launch in 2017. For that first flight test, the rocket will be able to launch 70 metric tons (77 tons) of payload into low-Earth orbit, almost three times what the space shuttle could carry. From there, SLS will be evolved to a configuration that will be able to carry 130 metric tons (143 tons), more weight than any rocket ever has been able to carry. 'While many people think of the Space Launch System in terms of human exploration, SLS could have a wide application in a lot of other areas, including space science,” said Steve Creech, assistant program manager for strategy and partnerships for SLS. How it compares: The SLS is larger than the Saturn rockets than launched man to the Moon. It will also be more powerful than any rocket in operation today. Russia's super-rocket design has yet to be unveiled. However construction of the first stage of Russia's super-rocket - capable of lifting 80 tonnes - is already underway . Nasa's previous rockets, the Saturn, Shuttle and right, the smaller configuration of the new SLS . 'For missions to the outer planets, for example, SLS could make it possible to do things that are currently impossible, such as sending larger scientific spacecraft with more instruments to far off destinations with reduced transit times.' Agency scientific and engineering teams have been evaluating whether there would be potential benefits from launching deep space robotic spacecraft, such as the Europa Clipper, a proposed mission to one of Jupiter's icy moons, on the SLS rocket, and determined the rocket would enable the spacecraft to fly direct trajectories to our solar system’s outer planets, rather than using planetary gravities to gain speed, reducing transit time compared to current launch vehicles. In the case of the Europa Clipper, for example, the transit time would be reduced to less than half of what it would be using other launch vehicles. 'For as long as people have been launching rockets into space, mission designers have had to work within certain limitations – a spacecraft can only be so heavy and it has to fit within a certain width,” Creech said. 'Depending on how large you make it, it can only go so fast, which in some cases limits where you can go. 'Today, if you want to send a mission to the outer planets, you have to be able to make it fit within that box. With SLS, we’re about to make that box much larger.

'With the space shuttle, for example, we were able to launch missions like NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope that were about the size of a school bus. 'With SLS, you can design a spacecraft even larger than the space shuttle that carried Hubble. 'It’s going to open up an entirely new way of thinking about how we plan and design planetary science missions.' 'The Space Launch System could be really game-changing for space science,” said ACO manager Reggie Alexander. 'For some missions, it makes it much easier and quicker to carry them out. 'A Mars sample return mission, for example, could be flown using only one rocket instead of three. 'But for other destinations, SLS lets you do things we could only dream of before – like collecting samples from the geysers of Saturn’s moon Enceladus.' an artist's impression of the rocket heading for the launch pad .

"Cinnamon could be a secret weapon in the battle against Parkinson’s disease. Scientists have found that the spice is the source of a chemical that can protect the brain. Our liver converts cinnamon into sodium benzoate, an approved drug used in the treatment for neural disorders. In a study of mice at Rush University Medical Centre in Chicago, a team of researchers found that the chemical then enters the brain, stops the loss of proteins that help protect cells, protects neurons and improves motor functions. Billy Connelly (left) and Michael J Fox (right) have both been diagnosed with Parkinson's. The study shows that cinnamon could potentially be one of the safest approaches to halt disease progression in patients . Lead researcher Professor Kalipada Pahan told the Journal of Neuroimmune Pharmacology: ‘Cinnamon has been used widely as a spice throughout the world for centuries. 'This could potentially be one of the safest approaches to halt disease progression in Parkinson’s patients.’ Professor Pahan said tests had shown that Ceylon cinnamon is better at halting Parkinson's as it is more pure. He said the next step is testing cinnamon on patients with the disease. The study found that after being eaten, ground cinnamon is converted into the chemical sodium benzoate, which then enters the brain, stops the loss of Parkin and DJ-1, protects neurons, normalises neurotransmitter levels, and improves motor functions in mice with Parkinson's disease. Professor Pahan said: 'Understanding how the disease works is important to developing effective drugs that protect the brain and stop the progression of Parkinson's.' Scientists have found that the spice is the source of a chemical that can protect the brain. Our liver converts cinnamon into sodium benzoate, an approved drug used in the treatment for neural disorders . Parkinson's disease is a slowly progressive disease that affects a small area of cells within the mid-brain known as the substantia nigra. Gradual degeneration of these cells causes a reduction in a vital chemical neurotransmitter, dopamine. The decrease in dopamine results in one or more of the classic signs of Parkinson's disease that includes: resting tremor on one side of the body; slowness of movement; stiffness of limbs; and gait or balance problems. The cause of the disease is unknown, but both environmental and genetic causes have been speculated by experts. While one in six patients are diagnosed before age 50, it is generally considered a disease that targets older adults, affecting one of every 100 persons over the age of 60.","Liver converts spice into sodium benzoate - used to treat neural disorders .

"Zurich's drive-thru brothels have been hailed a success by Swiss social services, a year after they first opened. The experiment in Switzerland's largest city began last August when the authorities opened Europe's first municipal drive-in brothel in an old industrial area. It was hoped the initiative would slash the number of sex workers on the streets, while at the same time offering them a safer space to work. But not all of them are happy with the arrangements. Scroll down foe video . Privacy... Two empty so-called 'sex boxes' at Zurich's sex drive-in, which has been hailed a success by Swiss social services one year after it first opened in an industrial site in the west of the city . A prostitute looks at the facilities: Sex workers agreeing to take part in the scheme have to get a permit and pay tax to avail of the drive-in's creature comforts, which include a laundry, showers and cafe . Authorities admitted that some have complained their earnings have fallen since the new initiative began, and that they are too far from city centre bars and clubs. Running the drive-in, which cost around 2million euros ($2.6 million; £1.6million) to set up, has also proved more costly than originally thought. Zurich's drive-thru brothel opened last August, with sex workers who agreed to move from their traditional haunts in the city centre allowed to ply their trade there safely and with a minimum of fuss. The site to the west of the city boasts helpful signposts and understated wooden drive-in 'sex boxes' where customers can be served in relative privacy in the comfort of their own cars. Sex workers agreeing to take part in the scheme did, however, have to get a permit and pay tax to avail of the drive-in's creature comforts, which include a laundry, showers and cafe. Smoke break: Zurich's drive-thru brothel opened last August, with sex workers who agreed to move from their traditional haunts in the city centre allowed to ply their trade there safely and with a minimum of fuss . Kerb-crawling zone... A helpful pictogram informs any passers-by of exactly what  happens at the site . They didn't have much choice in the matter. At the same time, Zurich launched a crackdown on unregulated prostitution and confined the oldest trade to just the drive-thru and two other zones. City are officials are pleased with the results. 'The new regulation of street prostitution has attained its objectives of protecting the population and the sex workers,' they said in a statement. Social services said that as well as protecting prostitutes, few neighbours were bothered by the comings and goings at the drive-in in the Altstetten district. No increase in street walkers had been noticed in the two other districts of the city where prostitution is tolerated, they said. Crackdown: At the same time as opening the brothel and licensing two other parts of the city as paid-for sex zones, Zurich's authorities curtailed the sex trade across the rest of the city. (Picture posed by models) Residents had risen up in protest at the number of prostitutes descending after dark on the Sihlquai, a main street near the city centre, and the authorities were worried about human trafficking if the trade was left unregulated. 'The first year of the service has been positive,' Zurich social services said in their statement. The number of prostitutes working in the drive-in averaged 15 a night, half the number who worked the old red-light area before the city stepped in to regulate the business. A spokesperson for the Sex Worker Open University, a group which campaigns for the rights of sex workers in the UK, told MailOnline that the initiative, while welcome, had its problems. 'Any initiative that truly makes selling sex safer would be welcome, but the ""cleaning up"" of areas where people engage in commercial sex is often in the interests of the public rather than the sex worker, who is often made more vulnerable by losing earnings and being ""tucked away"" out of sight,' she said. 'Sex worker rights advocates all over the world along with organisations such as World Health Organization, and UN Women all agree that full decriminalisation, rather than Swiss-style regulation and licensing, is the best human-rights based approach to keeping sex workers safe.'","Site in an old industrial part of west Zurich was opened last August .

"Marie McKinlay, 40, pictured arriving at court, is alleged to have run a high-class escort agency called Allure . A brothel madam used the profits from her £500,000-a-year business to put her two children through private school, a court heard yesterday. Marie McKinlay allegedly employed 25 high-class prostitutes able to offer clients everything from ‘girlfriend experience to porn star experience’. They charged as much as £300 an hour and £1,500 for overnight bookings that had to ‘include some sleep’. McKinlay’s online escort agency was no more than a front for a prostitution racket, London’s Southwark Crown Court was told. The 40-year-old rented a £1,500-a-month apartment in central London where clients could romp with two girls from a roster with names such as ‘Sophie Sweetness’ and ‘Beth Angel’. She is said to have made more than £350,000 in profits from the racket in three years. When the officers who arrested her told her what her earnings were she claimed to be shocked but said the money had ‘put two of her children through private school and paid her £1,500 monthly rent’. Edmund Vickers, prosecuting, said: ‘Marie McKinlay ran an internet escort agency which provide prostitutes at what could be described as the high end of the market, the expensive end, for clients who were willing to pay £300 or more an hour for sexual services. ‘She interviewed and recruited the girls, she uploaded their details to the website – not only their photos but the services  that each girl offered and their prices – she dealt with the clients, and she organised the girls’ bookings. ‘She charged the girls 30 per cent commission on all the takings, which made her a small fortune. ‘In less than two-and-a-half years between December 2008 and May 2011, when one looks at her bank account, one can see she received cash deposits totalling something over £350,000. 'You will see that when the defendant was arrested, for the period from January to June 2011, she had already made over £90,000.’ Voyeurism: At Southwark Crown Court (pictured), Parsons also admitted to making or possessing 61 indecent photographs and distributing one image of children between four and ten-years-old . When McKinlay was detained at her . home in Southampton in July 2011 police seized a diary which recorded . ‘the names of the working girls and the amounts owed by each girl for . each day of the year’. In interview in December 2011 . McKinlay admitted setting up the agency and said her ‘ambition’ was that . it should become ‘a top or elite agency’ and that she had 25 girls on . her books. She admitted to officers that she had . rented the flat in London Bridge but had been forced to cancel the . contract in August 2010 as ‘the girls had used it for too many late . night parties’. Mr Vickers added: ‘The defendant was . responsible for putting in services provided by each of the girls that . could range from French kissing to what is described as girlfriend . experience to porn star experience. ‘The Crown say there can be no doubt that this was prostitution and that the defendant was controlling it.’ McKinlay, of Lewisham in South-East London, denies controlling prostitution for gain and converting criminal property.

"It is one of the most spectacular birds of prey, with a wingspan of more than 1.5 metres. So when this magnificent osprey swooped down to poach a trout from a loch near Aviemore in the Scottish Highlands, the outcome was perhaps predictable.

Attack: The osprey attempts to take flight with the trout between its claws - and with the mallard in hot pursuit . As the raptor clasped the fish between its iron-like talons, the outraged mallard – a featherweight by comparison, with a mere 80cm wingspan – launched a full-frontal attack. Spreading its wings, it churned the water into a frenzy, quacking loudly in anger. Had the osprey, also known as a sea hawk, not been so determined, it may well have scored a duck. But in the end, the mallard’s valiant efforts were in vain and the osprey made away with its tasty catch. Leaving the issue of fishing rights still to be decided – by ‘the beak’ perhaps?

"An animal lover was left horrified when she picked her dog up from a grooming salon to find that staff had shaved off all of its fur. Snieguole Ghuman, 50, only dropped off her German Shepherd Simba at the canine beauty parlour for a wash and brush to remove some matted fur. But when she returned she expected to see her beloved pet’s white coat looking fluffy and groomed, but was shocked when she found him almost completely bald, which has left Simba 'depressed'. Shaved off: Snieguole Ghuman with her depressed dog Simba after a traumatic visit to the grooming Salon . Happier days: Simba and his flowing fur before it became so matted the groomer cut it all off . Simba is now only walked at night because people laugh and sneer when they see him, her owner says. Staff at the salon had shaved off all the hair from the dog’s body leaving just his head covered in the inch thick fur. When she asked the staff what had happened, she was told they had no choice and had acted on advice from the RSPCA. Gemma Barnett, owner of the Starz Grooming Salon in Bournemouth, Dorset,explained that Simba had been so matted she had no choice but to call them, and shave it all off. Snieguole, who is also from Bournemouth, says she has now been forced to stop walking Simba during the day due to pointing and staring from members of the public. Furious: Georgia Barnett (19) outside her pet grooming salon in  Bournemouth, Dorset, says she followed RSPCA advice and clipped Mrs Ghuman's dog . Snieguole’s daughter, Brigita Pritchett, 28, said: 'My mum had taken him in two weeks previously and asked for a wash and brush to sort his coat out. 'He can get very matted as his fur is so thick and he loves going in the sea and mud which can make it like it. 'Then the next thing she knew was there was an RSPCA officer knocking on her door and the salon owner had reported her. 'My mum arranged to bring him back there and get it sorted, but when she went to pick him up all his fur had completely gone. Sad: Mrs Ghuman says Simba has become shy and depressed following the incident . Shocked: Simba is now only walked at night because people who seem him laugh, her owner says . 'The problem areas were just his belly and slightly on his legs, so I couldn’t understand why they needed to shave him completely. 'He is a very sensitive dog and my mum said you could tell he didn’t like it, people then started pointing and staring at him as they walked home and he is now very depressed. 'Now she is forced to walk him at night because of all the looks they are getting.'Miss Barnett, 19, said that Simba was so matted she had no choice but to clip his fur to the short length, as less severe blades would only get stuck in the thick coat. 'Simba had been in twice before I called the RSPCA, and I had said to the owner both times that he needed to be clipped as his fur was so matted. 'She then agreed to come in for a clip. I tried to use a different blade but it wouldn’t go through his fur, so I used a shorter one. 'The only reason it looks so short is because it’s a white dog, on a black dog it wouldn’t look so bad. I had to remove as much fur as I did because it was that badly matted. 'His skin was blood red because the knots were pulling it so badly, I do what is best for the dog and their welfare and happiness.' A spokesperson for the RSPCA confirmed that they had received a complaint and are investigating the issue.","The dog was dropped off for a wash and brush and left having had all his fur cut off .

"A widow whose husband, mother and father died within the space of 18 months at Staffordshire hospital angrily confronted staff as thousands staged a demonstration against proposals to downgrade major services. Wearing a sign that read 'My husband drank out of a case! Where were you then!' Heather Wilhelms had to be restrained by police as she made her feelings known to doctors and nurses who are fighting to save their jobs. An estimated 30,000 marched from the town centre to the hospital to voice opposition after Mid . Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust was placed into administration five . days ago and taken over by a team of managers who will spend 45 days . deciding its fate. Mrs Wilhelms, who held up picture frames with photos of her dead parents and husband, was restrained by a police officer during the Stafford protest today . Heather Wilhelms, whose husband and parents died in Stafford Hospital, was a lone protester among thousands of supporters of the scandal-hit hospital today. A sign pinned to her front read: 'My husband drank out of a vase! Where were you then?' Heather Wilhelms told the BBC last month that she did not want Stafford Hospital to close . The trust, which runs Stafford and . Cannock hospitals, has a troubled past and up to 1,200 patients are . feared to have died needlessly due to poor care between 2005 and 2009. In . February, a long-awaited report blamed the disaster on a ‘culture of . fear’, with managers being more obsessed with meeting targets than . patient care. Mrs Wilhelms is one of among nearly 100 bereaved relatives and victims to be paid more than £1 million compensation in the largest ever group claim against a British hospital in 2010. Speaking to the Telegraph at the time, she told how doctors failed to notice her mother Pauline Nicklin, 71, had two cancerous tumours on her ovaries for two years before she died in 2006. Nine months later, her father Percy went to the hospital with a deadly foot infection, but was sent home without treatment. Convinced something was wrong, Mrs Wilhems took him back where he was diagnosed with blood poisoning and gangrene and died four days later aged 76. Her husband Tom was also treated at the hospital before he died from a lethal lung disease but Mrs Wilhelms again complained of appalling conditions. Mrs Wilhelms's husband Tom died at the hospital in 2007 after suffering a lethal lung disease . Thousands of campaigners marched from the town's Market Square to protest against the removal of major services from Stafford Hospital . Hospital staff joined protesters on the march in support of the hospital, run by the scandal-hit Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust . The Trust was put into administration this week - only the second time this has happened in the NHS . She said: 'They went into that . hospital to get the treatment and care to make them better. Instead, one . by one, they came out of that place in their coffins.' Despite . her horrific experiences at Stafford hospital, last month Mrs Wilhelms . told the Midlands Express and Star that she did not want to see it . close. She said: 'People do not want Stafford Hospital to close and I don’t want it to close. 'Although I do think there needs to be a clean sweep. They need to bring someone in to sort it out once and for all.' Campaigners . of all ages today packed into the Market Square in Stafford for the . rally and mile-long march to the hospital, with many holding placards . and banners showing their opposition to the withdrawal of services . including maternity care from the hospital. A public inquiry found that it had . provided 'appalling' standards of care and caused unnecessary suffering . to hundreds of patients over a five-year period up to 2009. Sue Hawkins, chair of the Support Stafford Hospital group, said today that it was important to move on from the past. 'I think we've got to talk about 2013,' she said. 'What happened, happened. The numbers . will be debatable but what we've got to do is move forward and look to . the future for our community. 'We've got a safe hospital today and we're looking to the future. 'We need to have an Intensive Care . Unit here, we need to have an Accident and Emergency 24 hours a day and . we believe that's possible. 'We know there have to be changes, we know there may have to be some alliance with another hospital to achieve that.' The march was organised by the Support Stafford Hospital campaign group, which is fighting cuts to major services, including accident and emergency, at the hospital . The Stafford Brigade marching band, in campaign T-shirts, joined the protesters as they chanted on the route to the hospital . Many of those at the demonstration, . including hospital workers, community groups and political . representatives, said there was hope for the hospital. Heidi Fligg, 46, said: 'People never appreciate anything until it's gone. 'I've had family and friends that have survived all sorts through Stafford and I just say it needs our support. 'We're not the only hospital suffering, I appreciate that, but why should we be the scapegoat for every other hospital?' Admin . worker Jo Van Derwyk, 46, said she had given birth to four babies at . Stafford Hospital - the youngest is now five and the eldest nearly 21 - . and had only good experiences then and since. She . said: 'Stafford is a large town and it needs its hospital, it needs all . its acute services, its emergency services and its maternity services.' Another . supporter, Brian Henderson, said: 'As you can see today, the sense of . feeling that people want services locally is immense.' A young girl held up a placard reading: 'Stafford Hospital saved my life' One canine campaigner wore a 'Don't let it go to the dogs' neckerchief .

"Tragic: Gloria Knowles, who was savaged to death by her daughter's dogs, pictured at Harrington's pie and mash shop, Tooting, where she worked . Fresh calls were made for a change in the law today after a great-grandmother was apparently mauled to death by her daughter's dogs in her back garden. The five animals pounced on Gloria Knowles, 71, after she went into the garden to give them their evening meal as a favour to her daughter, Beverley Mason. The widow was badly injured when the dogs – two 'giant' Bordeaux French mastiffs, two American bulldogs and a small mongrel – seemed to suddenly turn on her. She was found dead at the scene in Morden, South London on Tuesday night. Currently, police can only prosecute owners of dogs who harm people if the attack happens in public - and they can only forcibly remove illegal dogs. However, today further calls were made for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) to change the law to allow dog control rules to apply everywhere. The Communications Union CWU, which . represents postmen, is campaigning to change the law and said the . Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 is failing to protect both dog owners and attack . victims. They pointed to two incidents where postmen in Cambridge and Sheffield almost lost limbs while carrying out their duties. The man who owned two rottweilers that almost tore off the Cambridge postman's arm in 2008 escaped prosecution. Brutal: The court heard how all of the dogs, including two French Mastiffs, two American bulldogs and a small mongrel (all pictured), have been put down after all their bite marks were found on Mrs Knowles' body . Billy Hayes, CWU general secretary, . said: 'The death of Gloria Knowles is another sad reminder of the need . for better dangerous dogs laws. Under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991, dog owners cannot be prosecuted if their animal attacks someone on private property. This has raised controversy, especially when it comes to the case of police officers who are attacked by dogs when making an arrest in a suspect’s home and the owner escapes prosecution. Postal workers, nurses and social workers, who are all lawfully entitled to be on private property, are also affected by the rules. Four children and one adult were killed in dog attacks in private homes between 2007 and 2010. The number of injuries has more than doubled from 2,915 in 1997 to 6,118 in 2010. Currently, the law says only owners can only be prosecuted if a dog attack occurs on public land, not in places such as in family homes. The Communication Workers Union launched a ‘Bite Back’ campaign to change the law to cover attacks on private property. Scotland and Northern Ireland have already introduced new improved legislation and Wales is legislating in the current session. 'The private property issue is again . highlighted in this case. Although it may not be appropriate to . prosecute the daughter for her mother’s death – she will be suffering . all sorts of agonies over the loss of her mother – it could have been . necessary under different circumstances. 'If a person is killed by dogs on . private property there is almost no chance of prosecuting the owner and . getting compensation for victims, regardless of the recklessness of the . dog owner and the viciousness of the attack.' He added: 'This government has procrastinated and . steadfastly refused to act on the issue of dangerous dogs while people . continue to suffer serious injuries and lose their lives in dog attacks.' Police and paramedics were called after neighbours described hearing 'hysterical screaming . and barking' from Mrs Mason's garden. Five . dogs were later seized from the semi-detached property, and it was . revealed that Mrs Knowles had had a heart attack as the animals set on . her. It is not yet known if she suffered a . heart attack before or during the attack. A post mortem examination is . expected to be carried out later today. Nazir Hussein, a friend and neighbour of Mrs Knowles, was alerted . to the attack when he heard her daughter Mrs Mason screaming 'Mum, Mum, Mum' outside . the house. Mrs Knowles lived next door to her . daughter, with her granddaughter, who has a baby of her own. The family . has run Harrington's pie and mash shop in nearby Tooting, for several . generations. Mrs Mason lives with her husband, Dylan, and her other three children. The couple own the dogs together. Mr Hussein, 65, said he had long been afraid of the family's dogs, describing them as 'vicious'. Dog attack: Mrs Knowles (centre) with daughters Jasmine-Jade Knowles (left), and Beverley Knowles (right) 'I would see the dogs being walked in the park but I didn't want to walk near them,' he said. 'They were vicious dogs – you knew by how they pulled on the lead and you could hear them barking from my house. Neighbour: Kevin Hamilton said he heard screaming but assumed it was one of Beverley's children . 'There were so many dogs something like this was bound to happen.' Another neighbour, Kevin Hamilton, described hearing screams from Mrs Mason's house at 5:15pm but mistook the noise, thinking it had come from one of Mrs Knowles's grandchildren. Accountant Mr Hamilton, 65, who lives in the other house next door to Mrs Mason, described hearing 'hysterical screaming and barking' as he watched television. He only became aware of the attack when a police officer told him about it, explaining that Mrs Knowles was alone in the house when she went to feed the dogs. He said officers had told him it was Mr Mason who discovered Mrs Knowles's body. Mr Hamilton described the two mastiffs as 'real muscle dogs' with 'enormous chests', and said the animals had a 'pack mentality'. He added: 'If one jumped on you it would certainly knock you over.' He revealed Mrs Mason also owned cats and that one of them was killed a few weeks ago after the dogs began playing with it. He said: 'About two months ago they had this white cat which died. 'The cat used to sleep with the dogs and one of these dogs started to playfully toss it in the air. They have a pack mentality - so the others started doing it too. 'It survived initially and they wrapped it in a blanket, but it later passed away from shock. They are not the sort of dogs you would want to mess with.' He described Mrs Knowles, a widow,  as a 'fit old bird' who talked to all the neighbours and enjoyed gardening. She had lived on the street with her husband Victor for 40 years, until he died five years ago. Neighbours said her daughter and her family moved into the house next door the year after Mr Knowles's death. They explained that there was a gate between the gardens of the two houses which Mrs Knowles would regularly use, often to feed the animals. Scene: Police have cordoned off the Morden home where Mrs Knowles died last night . Scene: The back garden of Gloria Knowles' daughter Beverley where it is believed the five dogs attacked her . Tragedy: Dog baskets and food bowls can be seen in the garden at the scene where Gloria Knowles may have been mauled to death by the animals . Animals removed: Police have seized the two French Mastiffs, the American bulldogs and the mongrel and are in police-approved kennels pending the post-mortem . Another neighbour, who did not wish to be named, said: 'The dogs were always barking, everyone around here will tell you that. 'They had always had dogs but never . any that big. They were not the sort of dogs I would have around . children, let me put it that way.' Two years ago Barbara Williams, 52, was mauled to death by an eight stone Neapolitan mastiff in Wallington, south London. The . dog had been kept in a cage seven inches shorter than its body. Earlier . this year its owner Alex Blackburn-Smith, 35, admitted failing to . ensure the dog's welfare and was ordered to do 150 hours' unpaid work . and pay costs of £3,300 at Croydon Magistrates' Court. In . January Leslie Trotman, 83, died after he was mauled by a . 'pitbull-type' dog that had broken out of his neighbour's garden in . Brentford, West London. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: . 'Police were called at around 6.25pm on Tuesday to reports of a . 71-year-old woman found deceased at a residential address in Morden.' He added that an investigation was . under way to establish the cause of death, and said the woman had . sustained a 'number of injuries'. A London Ambulance Service spokesman said: 'We were called at 6.12pm to [a house] in Morden to a patient in cardiac arrest. Sadly, the patient was dead at the scene.' The family was too upset to talk last night. Mrs Knowles's death follows a spate of attacks by dangerous breeds. Earlier this year, Leslie Trotman, 83, died after being mauled by a 'pit bull-type' dog that had escaped from his neighbour's garden in Brentford, London. And two years ago Barbara Williams, 52, was killed by an eight-stone Neapolitan mastiff. Its owner, Alex Blackburn-Smith, 35, admitted failing to ensure the dog's welfare after it was discovered to have been living in a cage seven inches shorter than its body.","Gloria Knowles, 71, went next door to feed the animals but was apparently mauled to death .

"This is the shocking moment a mother left her baby in its pram and made a vicious racist attack on a total stranger. Serial thug Amanda Lowe, 26, was only yards away from her daughters, aged four months and eight years, when she shouted abuse at a passer-by. As her boyfriend joined in and punched the victim to the ground, Lowe repeatedly stamped on the man’s head before returning to her children, miming a punch and a kick to show what she had done. Scroll down for video . Thug: Amanda Lowe is seen launching an unprovoked attack on Khuram Nisar in this shocking CCTV footage . A judge called Lowe a ‘disgrace’ after watching horrifying CCTV footage of the attack and warned of the . effects it would have on her children. Judge Lindsey Kushner, QC, told her: . ‘Kids who have mothers who behave like you end up behaving like you. That damage starts from when they are tiny.’ But despite the fact it was a fourth . conviction for assault in six years for Lowe – who is now pregnant again . – the judge spared her a prison sentence for the sake of those . children. Walked free: Lowe's conviction is her fourth conviction in six years . That meant that despite a string of . convictions between them, Lowe’s boyfriend and cousin, who also . intervened, had to be freed as well because they had admitted less . serious offences. Lowe had been drinking with Wesley . Earls, father of her unborn child, and Daniel Wray in Piccadilly Gardens . in the centre of Manchester this May when the attack took place, the . city’s Crown Court heard. The area was crowded with families enjoying the evening sunshine as Khuram Nisar walked through on his way home from work. Without provocation, Lowe shouted . racist abuse at him and added: ‘You’re a terrorist, don’t come near me, . I’m worried you’ll blow me up’ and ‘Go back to Pakistan’. He responded by telling 26-year-old . Earls to ‘control his woman’, but Earls reacted by punching Mr Nisar to . the ground, joined by Wray, 21. CCTV footage shows Lowe leaving her . eight-year-old daughter, along with the pram with her baby in, and . enthusiastically joining in the assault. She is seen repeatedly kicking Mr Nisar’s head and stamping on it in front of witnesses. He suffered cuts and bruises. After the fight was broken up Lowe appeared ‘thrilled’ by what she had done and threw a pretend punch, the court heard. As they left the square Lowe was seen miming a kick. Seconds later the three were arrested. Between them they had 21 previous convictions, the court heard, many for violence. Members of the public watch as Amanda Lowe continues to attack Mr Nisar in Piccadilly Gardens, Manchester . By this point Mr Nisar had been kicked to the ground as Lowe stamped on his head. A passer-by was unable to stop the assault . Mr Nisar's shocked face can be seen as Amanda Lowe, now pregnant with her third child, continues her unprovoked attack . The footage, released by the Crown Prosecution Service, shows the assault which took place on May 21 this year in Manchester city centre . Lowe appears to recreate the attack for the benefit of a friend as she pushes her four-month-old baby girl in her pram . Lowe, pictured chatting to friends after the attack, was arrested with her baby's father Wesley Earls and cousin Daniel Wray shortly after the attack . Dressing gown: Lowe answers the door at her home . Lowe, who has a criminal record . dating from when she was 17 including assaults and disorderly behaviour, . admitted racially aggravated assault occasioning bodily harm. Earls, who was last year given a . restraining order over a domestic violence offence, and Wray, who in . 2009 was convicted of assaulting a police officer, both admitted a . single charge of actual bodily harm. Judge Kushner told Lowe: ‘The damage . you are doing to your children – there at the time and seeing you drunk, . the risk you put them at – is disgraceful. She was in that state in . charge of two children. 'That in itself is a criminal . offence, drunk in charge of a child. How irresponsible can you get? You . could easily have been dealing with a care case here.’ But she said the ‘enormous impact’ that jailing Lowe would have on her children meant it was unfair to lock her up. Lowe and Earls, both of Blackley, . Manchester, were given 12-month jail sentences, suspended for two years, . and two-year supervision orders. Lowe was ordered to attend a ‘women’s programme’ while Earls was sent on a course for ‘violent, angry, impulsive drinkers’. Wray, of Salford, said to have been ‘fleetingly’ involved by punching Mr Nisar before retreating, was given the same sentence. Judge Kushner told all three that if they offended again they would go to jail. Now watch the CCTV footage .","Amanda Lowe spared prison by judge at Manchester Crown Court .

"Return: Nicolas Sarkozy is set to announce  that he will stand for the French presidency in 2017 . Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy is poised to launch his bid for re-election as leader in 2017, it was revealed today. Sarkozy, 59, is set to announce this weekend that he will stand for the presidency of the centre-right opposition UMP party, insiders said. The former leader had told journalists they would 'never hear from him again' after he lost the election to socialist Francois Hollande in the 2012 election. But he then announced last year that he was considering standing for re-election because the socialists were 'ruining France'. Disastrous left-wing policies left him 'no choice' but to make a challenge for the leadership, he said. He added: 'Looking at the disastrous state France risks finding itself in, I will have no choice in 2017. 'The question is not knowing whether I'm going to make a come-back, but if morally I have the choice regarding France to not come back... Morally, I can not let the French people down.' His political comeback is said by friends to be strongly opposed by his own wife Carla Bruni, who has 'begged him' not to stand because people were 'mean to him' as president. Sarkozy's leadership bid could also be hindered by a raft of corruption charges he faces over illegal campaign funding. He is accused of accepting illegal party funding payments from France's richest woman and L'Oreal heiress Lilian Bettencourt in return for tax breaks. He has accused the country's socialist government of 'framing' him with the charges and branded the accusations 'grotesque'. Pascal Perrineau, of the Institute of Political Studies in Paris, said: 'If he becomes UMP president, Sarkozy's political agenda will be constantly pushed around by an investigation into this case or that case, by a judge summoning him for questioning. Decisions: Sarkozy said would be 'letting the French people down' by not stranding against socialist incumbent Francois Hollande (left) at the 2017 French presidential elections. Sarkozy's political comeback is thought to be strongly opposed by his own wife Carla Bruni (right), who has reportedly 'begged him' not to stand . French Prime Minister Manuel Valls won a vote of confidence yesterday in a tense ballot, allowing him to push through economic reforms that have divided his Socialist Party. The government's once comfortable margin was diluted in the 269-244 vote, with 53 abstentions. The result denies the government its absolute majority, but still allows Valls to carry out reforms aimed at lifting France out of its economic crisis. President Francois Hollande's popularity has plunged over failure to cure the nation's high unemployment rate, zero growth and oversized deficit. He had promised to create jobs for the French when he took office in 2012 after defeating the conservative incumbent, Nicolas Sarkozy. 'He had also gradually forged the image of a wise man who stayed on the edge of the river and who only made comments every now and then,' Mr Perrineau added. 'But if he becomes UMP president, he will be asked for his opinion on everything every morning. There is a risk he will be worn down,' he said. While his supporters are desperate for Sarkozy to return to politics, the wider French population doesn't really care. A poll released on Tuesday by OpinionWay found that 64 per cent of French people are not interested in his upcoming comeback announcement. Sarkozy's main rival for the nomination of his right-wing UMP party to run for president is former French prime minister Alain Juppe. He was found guilty in connection with a separate corruption scandal seven years ago and handed a 14-month suspended prison sentence and banned from holding public office for two years, then went on to be foreign minister after the ban expired.","Nicolas Sarkozy, 59, says disastrous left-wing policies have 'ruined France'

"A team of skydivers have taken their extreme hobby to the next level by setting off fireworks as they leap from their plane, thousands of feet above the ground. The latest craze in extreme sports, pyrotechnic skydiving sees the team of four divers activate sets of fireworks strapped to their legs as they fall through the air at speeds of up to 120mph. Professional skydiving team Fastrax, based in Ohio, USA, have long wowed audiences with their ambitious stunts but their latest effort boasts the added danger of fireworks attached to the divers' ankles. Scroll down for video . Sparks will fly: A team of skydivers have taken their extreme hobby to the next level by setting off fireworks as they leap from their plane, thousands of feet above the ground . Latest craze: Pyrotechnic skydiving sees the team of four divers activate sets of fireworks strapped to their legs as they fall through the air at speeds of up to 120mph . After jumping at 13,500ft the divers press one of six buttons on their chest which sends an electrical impulse to trigger the fireworks. The explosives burn at 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit, the equivalent of 100,000 candles, for about 45 seconds each while the team members hang onto each other's arms in free fall. When they get to 5,000ft the team have to carefully release their parachutes while avoiding the flames, which can shoot up to 800ft in the air, before lighting another set of fireworks. The result is an incredible light show illuminating the night sky. Performers: The team has performed in movies and commercial, and regularly undertake stunts for television shows, as well as entertaining crowds at sporting events and air shows . Light up the sky: Professional skydiving team Fastrax, based in Ohio, USA, came up with the idea of strapping fireworks to the divers' legs . Free fall: After jumping at 13,500ft the divers press one of six buttons on their chest which sends an electrical impulse to trigger the fireworks . However, the team risk setting their own parachutes alight as well as the risks involved with jumping at night. 'It's pretty cool how we can actually create firework shows as we jump,' said team leader John Hart. 'It looks meteor when we're falling through the sky with flames flying behind us. 'It's just a long trail of fire. 'Other people do it with theatrical pyrotechnics but it's not genuine - they're small and there's no risk involved. Danger: When they get to 5,000ft the team have to carefully release their parachutes while avoiding the flames, which can shoot up to 800ft in the air, before lighting another set of fireworks . Risk: The result is an incredible light show illuminating the night sky but the team risk setting their own parachutes alight as well as the risks involved with jumping at night . Burn out: Team leader John Hart said divers can find it difficult to adjust their eyes when the fireworks have gone out . 'When we exit the aircraft you feel a lot of energy - it's pitch black apart from our electronic lights that we use to find each other. 'I haven't been on one that hasn't got my heart racing because it can be dangerous. 'The temperature goes up by six degrees just from the heat of the pyrotechnics and it is easy to be disorientated once the pyrotechnics have gone out. 'Your eyes haven't adjusted but you still have to identify your landing location in the dark. 'But it won't stop me because it's such a beautiful thing to be part of.' Mr Hart said the team, which formed in 2002, came up with the idea of adding fireworks to their daredevil routines to help them stand out from other display teams. Setting them apart: Mr Hart said the team, which formed in 2002, came up with the idea of adding fireworks to their daredevil routines to help them stand out from other display teams . Top performer: To even be considered for a part in the pyrotechnic team, divers must have completed 2,000 jumps . Light show: The team travel around the world performing at a number special events, and members believe their fireworks set them apart from other display teams . 'It all started when we were thinking about what could set us apart as a skydiving team,' he said. 'And we thought ""Let's set ourselves on fire!"" 'Now we travel around the world performing at special events where people are hoping to give a presentation or a fireworks display that extra spark. 'We've been to Malaysia, the UAE, Russia and Japan and all over the USA. 'Although we've got 30 people on the ordinary skydiving team there are just ten of us that do pyrotechnics. 'You need excellent freefall skills and stability. Being picked for the pyro team is the pinnacle of skydiving. Team members: Mr Hart, pictured second from left, said although 30 people were part of the Fastrax ordinary skydiving team, just ten performed with pyrotechnics . Equipment: Mr Hart demonstrates the firework sticks strapped to his ankle. They are controlled via buttons attached to his chest . Hot stuff: The temperature goes up by six degrees just from the heat of the pyrotechnics and it is easy for divers to be disorientated once the pyrotechnics have gone out . 'You have to do 2,000 jumps before you are even considered - it's no mean feat.' Photographer Norman Kent joins the team on their jumps to capture the moments the fireworks light up the sky on film. He said: 'It's a very delicate thing because you're basically jumping out of a plane with live explosives. 'I've worked on films like Godzilla and Enders Game filming aerial stunts but watching the Fastrax team skydive with fireworks is something else. Mystery: According to team members some of their night time displays have been followed by calls from members of the public mistaking the display team for UFOs . 'They have to perform the dive perfectly otherwise they're at risk of burning themselves. 'A small error means it could end very differently but it's a really spectacular thing. 'It's difficult to get close to take pictures while avoiding being burnt. 'I have a special suit which means I have great mobility as I freefall. It's really like flying.' Brave: Photographer Norman Kent joins the team on their jumps to capture the moments the fireworks light up the sky on film, and says the team must perform the dive perfectly to avoid any risk of being burnt .

"A football player who was beaten into a coma just took a big step on the road to recovery when he was discharged from rehab after five months. Isaac Kolstad, a former linebacker at Minnesota State University, Mankato, finally got a chance to return home after suffering a skull fracture and traumatic brain injury in a bar fight that happened last May near his school. His wife, Molly, shared the happy news on Kolstad's CaringBridge page. Scroll down for video . Back and doing better: Isaac Kolstad m(above in yellow at a September football game), a former linebacker at Minnesota State University, Mankato, emerged from rehab five months after he was attacked in a bar fight and suffered a traumatic brain injury . Baby girl: While he was in rehab his wife gave birth to a daughter, Malia (above with her father) Sportsman: Kolstad (pictured playing in a 2012 game) had to relearn how to walk . 'It is with a full heart that I update you all that today Isaac was discharged from inpatient care!' she wrote. 'After 5 months of being confined to a facility, of sleeping in a twin sized hospital bed, of reporting daily to nurses, doctors, therapists, and aides, Isaac is finally released and free to go home. He and his entire family are incredibly excited to take this huge step in Isaac’s recovery and start the process of transitioning back to family life.' Just this past September, Kolstad, 24, who graduated in 2013, made an emotional return to the playing field with some of his former teammates, walking out before kickoff during the opening game of ther season. He also became a father for the second time when his baby daughter Malia was born in June, less than a month after he was injured. Kolstand and his wife have another daughter, Haidyn. Rutgers University quarterback Philip Robert Nelson, who once played at the University of Minnesota, has been charged with one count of first-degree assault and one count of third-degree assault for the incident. Trevor Shelley, 21, who authorities believe punched Kolstad, was arrested just days after the attack and charged with felony assault counts. Kolstad, described by a friend as 'a quiet, young man' who was not a big drinker, was with a group of football players in the South Street Saloon just before closing time on the night of the fight. According to a criminal complaint, 20-year-old Nelson was angry that night because a bouncer at the bar had hit on his girlfriend.

Nelson and Kolstad got into a verbal dispute before Kolstad threw a punch that hit Nelson in the back, causing him to fall to the ground, according to a police officer, the complaint says. Graduate student Steph Stassen, 25, told the Star Tribune that the attacker came 'out of nowhere'. 'He [Kolstad] was knocked out on his feet,' she told the paper. 'He fell straight back and smoked his head on the pavement.' He was found at an intersection around 2am by police and taken to hospital in an ambulance. Kolstad suffered bleeding of the brain, skull fracture, brain swelling, brain shifting, and deterioration of lungs from lack of oxygen, according to the criminal complaint. He is now being treated at an inpatient rehabilitation program in the Twin Cities. There, he has bonded well with his new daughter, his wife Molly wrote.","Isaac Kolstad has emerged from rehab five months after entering following a traumatic brain injury he suffered during a bar fight .

"Singing in front of the team is now a rite of passage for any new player, but you wouldn't have seen Roy Keane belting out a tune in his heyday . The Manchester United legend also revealed he turned down the chance to appear on Celebrity Big Brother and I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here. Speaking to ShortList magazine, Keane revealed he doesn't like the tradition of player initiations, but gave fans a tease of must-watch TV that could have been. Roy Keane, on the bench as assistant manager of Aston Villa, has slammed the modern initiation of singing . 'It happens now at Villa, but if I was a player at a new club and someone said, “You’ve got to sing tonight,” I just f****** wouldn’t do it,' said Keane. 'I sing for nobody. People say it’s banter, but I don’t like that type of banter. 'I’d help players by making sure they settled in properly, making sure my wife touched base with their family. That was my way.'

"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers gave up his free Sunday to join striker Daniel Sturridge in a training session to test his fitness ahead of this week's key Champions League clash in Basle. Sturridge, who has missed Liverpool's last five matches after picking up a thigh injury on international duty with England, was put through his paces at the club's Melwood training ground - with Rodgers also taking part in the same routine under the watchful eye of two of the club's coaching staff. The Anfield boss, who has successfully lost weight during his two years at the club, joined his 25-year-old international in a series of sprints, slaloms, jogs and agility drills using rope ladders. Daniel Sturridge was injured while on international duty on September 5th . The 25-year-old was in attendance for the Merseyside derby on Saturday at Anfield . Brendan Rodgers (left) and Sturridge, pictured in July, took part in an extra training session on Sunday . Although Liverpool haven't yet confirmed whether Sturridge is fit to return on Wednesday night, the forward looked pain-free as he completed the strenuous work-out and Rodgers was all smiles 24 hours after seeing his side held 1-1 by Everton in the Merseyside derby. Rodgers was furious that Sturridge received his injury in an England training session after Liverpool's medical staff had passed on detailed information about his condition. Liverpool have failed to win a Premier League game since but they do go to Switzerland having who their opening game in Europe against Bulgaria's Ludogorets. Even so, Rodgers is clearly leaving no stone unturned trying to get Sturridge back - including sacrificing his own free time.

"An Australian woman who paid £800 for two new Apple iPhones lost her money when she opened the boxes - and found two real green apples inside. The 21-year-old Brisbane woman had placed an advertisement in an online buy-and-sell site saying she was looking to purchase a number of iPhones. Police in the Queensland town of Upper Mt Gravatt, near Brisbane, said that not long after the advert was placed in the Gumtree site a woman called and said she had two Apples for sale. The 21-year-old placed an advert online saying she was looking for two Apple iPhones, but was sold two apples . Senior Constable Jess Hopkin of the Upper Mt Gravatt Crime Prevention Unit said the two women arranged to meet at a McDonald's outlet, where the transaction took place. The purchaser handed over $1500, the equivalent of £800, and was given two new iPhone boxes in return, the Quest community newspaper of Queensland reported today. Her mistake was to not look inside. On returning home the young woman opened the boxes and found to her horror that they contained real apples. Senior Constable Hopkin warned people to be wary when they buy anything online. 'Don't stay away because most people are doing the right thing - but be smart about what you buy,' she said. 'If something seems too good to be true, it probably is. It's really just common sense.' On returning home the young woman opened the boxes and found to her horror that they contained real apples . Commentators writing on an online site weren't letting the buyer off the hook with their criticism. 'I don't know anyone that would hand over $1500 to a stranger without checking the item,' wrote one man. 'Besides, you can buy a brand new iPhone5 for $700. So if this is a true story then I'm sorry but she deserved it!' A woman asked: 'And she went to the police?? Seriously, I'd be too embarrassed to go to the police if I'd been that stupid.'

In the advertisement, which has since been removed from Gumtree, Peter said the space junk was found on the Castlereagh Highway, under the Pagan Creek bridge. A fireball spotted travelling over Australia last Thursday at 9.45pm was the third stage of the Soyuz rocket, which was launched from Kazakhstan on July 8. It plummeted to Earth at speeds of 29,000km/h. 'One of the valves is completely burnt off and has left some spectacular flow lines of melting titanium as it re-entered earth's atmosphere,' the Gumtree advertisement read. 'The second valve is still partially intact.' Peter believes the space junk is a fuel cell from a Russian rocket that re-entered the atmosphere over Australia last week . Professor of Planetary Science at Western Australia's Curtin University, Phil Bland, is one of several Australian researchers currently tracking the rocket's flight path. He told the ABC the item Peter was selling on Gumtree certainly looked like space debris, but doubted it was from the Russian rocket seen over Australia last week. 'You may get things scattered a little bit - say plus or minus a few kilometres - but there is no way it can move so far,' he said. Prof Bland said where the item was discovered was hundreds of kilometres east of the path of the re-entry.","Globe-shaped object was found near Walgett in northern NSW on Sunday .

"A New York artist has created a surreal set of images showing body painted models posing before New York City landmarks. The models in these images take on a transparent, almost ghost-like appearance - it is the result of a painstakingly detailed body-painting photo shoot among the city's most recognizable backdrops. Artist Trina Merry, 34, spends eight gruelling hours hand painting her models so they blend in seamlessly with their surroundings. Freedom! A model, her body painted to an incredible level of detail and taking on a ghost-like appearance, stands before the greys and the blues of downtown Manhattan . The resulting pictures show the models posing up against New York City landmarks such as the Freedom Tower, the Empire State Building, Central Park and the Brooklyn Bridge. Merry moved to the city only recently and said painting models into the city-scape was the way for her to engage with her new home. Such is the level of detail on the body painting, the models appear translucent, often with only their footwear left contrasting with their surroundings. Merry has previously stated she believes bodypainting creates a 'special connection' to a person that other art forms do not - it is, she said, a 'distinctly human experience'. Art imitates art: A model at the house of expressionist Willem de Kooning, part of a famed group of New York painters that included Jackson Pollock and Franz Kline . On the left, a body painted model sits on a bridge with her back to the camera, gazing out across the city with houses, the bridge and the skyline all painted across her. While on the right, the model faces the camera with the spectacular Brooklyn Bridge as her backdrop - her brightly coloured shoes left clearly distinguishable . This photo required an incredible amount of work to get the body paint dimensions perfect - the model appears almost translucent as she stands before Coney Island . Fame: These images have been viewed around the world - now body artist Trina Merry has given an insight into how she creates her work, despite run-ins with police .","Images show models painted to excruciatingly high level of detail and posing before New York City landmarks .

"Pictured is Martha - the last remaining passenger pigeon - who died in 1914, marking the rapid extinction of a bird species due to human activity . In 1866, a billion-strong flock of passenger pigeons, 300 miles long and one mile wide, darkened the skies of Ontario for 14 hours as they flew overhead. But less 50 years later, these impressive creatures, once abundant in North America, became extinct as a result of cutting down forests and hunting by humans. Now geneticists in San Francisco are hoping to bring the passenger pigeon back to life using centuries-old DNA. The company, Revive and Restore, will use a process known as ‘de-extinction’ which, if successful, could also be used to bring back hundreds of other extinct species. The process involves using passenger pigeon DNA taken from museum specimens. Scientists can then fill in the blanks with fragments from the band-tailed pigeon. This reconstructed genome would be placed into stem cells of a band-tailed pigeon, which would transform into a cell that could become a sperm or an egg. The scientists would then inject these so-called germ cells into band-tailed pigeons. Their hope is that, as those birds mate, their chicks would have some passenger pigeon genes. ‘The genomes of the two birds will be compared in close detail, to determine which differences are most crucial,’ the company said on their website. ‘The data and analysis will begin with the process of converting viable band-tailed DNA into viable passenger pigeon DNA.’ The process involves using passenger pigeon DNA taken from museum specimens. Scientists will then fill in the blanks with fragments of DNA from the band-tailed pigeon.This reconstructed genome would be placed into stem cells of a band-tailed pigeon. The scientists would then inject these so-called germ cells into band-tailed pigeons. Their hope is that, as those birds mate, their chicks would have some passenger pigeon genes . A century ago, Martha, a red-eyed, grey and brown bird famous as the last surviving passenger pigeon, keeled over, marking an extinction of a species. Revive and Restore will take the long-dead pigeon out of the file cabinets of history as part of their project. ‘Here was a bird like the robin that everybody knew and within a generation or two it was gone - and we were its cause,’ Duke University ecologist Stuart Pimm said. In the 18th and 19th centuries the passenger pigeon was the most abundant bird species on Earth. Unlike the domesticated carrier pigeon used for messages, these were wild birds. They were easy to catch because they stayed together. But they were considered a poor man's food; domestic workers complained about eating too much passenger pigeon. In . the 18th and 19th centuries the passenger pigeon was the most abundant . bird species on Earth. Unlike the domesticated carrier pigeon used for . messages, these were wild birds. They were easy to catch because they . stayed together . Band-tailed Pigeon (pictured) could help bring extinct Passenger Pigeon back to life, according to scientists . ‘Nobody ever dreamed that a bird that common could be brought into extinction that quickly,’ said University of Minnesota evolutionary biologist Bob Zink. Examination of the passenger pigeon's genetic code shows that their population grew and fell regularly from as much as five billion to as few as tens of millions. The chief causes of the extinction - cutting down Eastern U.S. forests and hunting - were man-made, Professor Zink added. By 1900, there were no passenger pigeons left in the wild. By 1914, there was just one - 29-year-old Martha at the Cincinnati Zoo. Then on September 1, 1914, Martha was found lying on the bottom of her cage. The passenger pigeon was now extinct. Pictured are stem cells made from the cell nucleas. These will be a crucial part of the 'de-extinction' process . It was the first public extinction, something people used to think happened only to relics of the past like dinosaurs, or critters stuck on islands like dodos, Pimm and other scientists said. Bringing the passenger pigeon back would cost millions and take at least a decade, said Ben Novak who is leading the project. Some scientists, however, don’t believe the idea is ethical or practical. But Professor Novak sees a world on the verge of a mass extinction of many species and feels something has to be done about it. Reviving some long-lost species, he said, may offer ‘a type of justice for what we're doing now and also teach people it's so much easier to keep something alive than to bring it back to life.’ On September 1, 1914, Martha  - the last remaining passenger pigeon - (pictured) was found lying on the bottom of her cage . By 1900, there we no passenger pigeons left in the wild. By 1914, there was just 29-year-old Martha at the Cincinnati Zoo. People lined up to see her. Then on September 1, 1914, Martha was found lying on the bottom of her cage meaning the passenger pigeon had become extinct. It had gone from billions of birds to zero in around a century. It was the first public extinction, something people used to think happened only to relics of the past like dinosaurs, or animals stuck on islands like dodos. Martha, the last of her kind, was put in a 300-pound block of ice and shipped to Washington D.C. and the Smithsonian. She was stuffed and mounted. When she travelled back to Cincinnati or to San Diego for a big conservation conference, she flew in a first class seat. For the last 15 years, she has been in a metal filing cabinet in the bowels of the Smithsonian, stuck on the same stick with an older stuffed unrelated pigeon named George. On Monday, they were separated, George was put back in storage and Martha was ready for a comeback. An exhibit on her extinction and the 100th anniversary starts June 24 at the Smithsonian.","San Francisco geneticists plan to use a process known as ‘de-extinction’

"Video interviews with victims of celebrity sex abusers including Jimmy Savile and Stuart Hall have been stolen, sparking fears they could have been used in a blackmail plot. As many as 50 testimonies from victims were reportedly taken from a flat used by a film-making company working on behalf of the Crown Prosecution Service. The tapes are believed to include filmed statements made by those accusing a number of high profile names, including notorious paedophile Savile, and former sports presenter Hall, 84, who is serving a total of 60 months behind bars for numerous indecent assault charges. Senstive: Video interviews with victims of celebrity sex abusers including Jimmy Savile (left) and Stuart Hall (right) have been stolen, sparking fears they could have been used in a blackmail plot . Police fear that the tapes, thought to have been stolen by a criminal gang, could have been used for blackmail or leaked online - potentially jeopardising future prosecutions. Four police forces have been deployed to help with the probe, and officers have been sent to Poland to help trace those responsible. So far, six men have been arrested for burglary and handling stolen goods following the break in at the Swan Films premises in Fallowfield, Manchester,on September 11. Police say the items taken have since been recovered. One highly-placed source said: 'There were serious concerns about the implications of this robbery,' a source involved in the investigation told the Sunday Mirror. High profile: The tapes are believed to include filmed statements made by those accusing a number of high profile names, including notorious paedophile Savile - who died in October 2011 . 'Officers were terrified future trials could collapse due to the evidence being compromised and there were also concerns that the videos could be uploaded on to social media or even be used as part of a future blackmail plot.' A CPS spokesman told MailOnline that items thought to have been taken in the break-in included interviews with victims and witnesses that had been sent to Swan Films since August 1. The tapes stolen were not the master copies of the interviews, and sensitive information held on computers that have subsequently been recovered had not been accessed between the time they were taken, and returned. 'Following a burglary at the premises of Swan Films, a Manchester based video editing contractor for the CPS, we are currently cooperating with the ongoing police investigation,' he said. 'During the burglary it is believed that material relating to a small number of cases, including some police interviews with victims or witnesses, sent to the company since  August 1 this year and within the Greater Manchester area, were stolen. 'Master copies of all material are retained by the prosecution. The computers containing this information have now been recovered and we can confirm that the sensitive information they contained was not accessed between the time they were stolen and their recovery. 'The CPS has secured all material which remained at the burgled premises and is asking for an urgent explanation of the security measures in place. We have worked with the police to identify the victims and witnesses who have been involved in the cases affected and are informing them of the successful recovery of the material in question.' Savile is now known to have abused hundreds of young victims over six decades. But the former Top Of The Pops presenter, who received a knighthood in 1990, died aged 84 in October 2011 – a year before the allegations emerged in an ITV documentary after the BBC shelved a Newsnight investigation into the star. Hall was jailed for 30 months last year after he admitted indecently assaulting 13 young girls, aged between nine and 17, over a 20-year period. In May he was ordered to serve an extra two and a half years for sexually assaulting another underage girl.","Up top 50 filmed statements thought to have been taken in break-in .

"Hoax UFO videos have a tried and tested format: shaky footage, a bogus spaceship and cries of wonder from the person filming on a smartphone. But one Hollywood animator has gone the extra mile to produce a convincing UFO 'gag' which is entirely created with CGI effects - including the car, the skies and the scenery. Canadian Aristomenis Tsirbas, who has worked on Titanic, Hellboy and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, created a short clip which appears to show a UFO flying over Santa Clarita, California, seen from a moving vehicle. Scroll down for video . Hoax: The car, the skies and the scenery are all the product of CGI effects, as well as the apparent UFO . Tsirbas said the sci fi effects, such as the UFO and the mothership, were easier to create than the scenery . The video seems to show a car driving through a desert at sunset when a dark, flat, latticed object flies overhead. The driver can be heard muttering 'Woah', before getting out of the car in the breeze to get a better shot of the apparent UFO. It hovers around some pylons before a 'mothership' appears from nowhere, collects the UFO and vanishes, at which the driver says: 'Holy...' Tsirbas, who spent four months . creating the 30 second clip, said he wanted to play a joke to prove to . critics of CGI that the effects can look realistic. The 45-year-old director told Wired: 'The point of the video was to prove that CGI can look natural and . convincing. 'Everybody assumes the background and . car are real, and that the UFOs are probably fake, especially the . over-the-top mothership at the end. CGI effects show the driver pulling over to get a better shot of the UFO as it hovers by electricity pylons . Tsirbas described the mothership as being 'over-the-top' but deliberately made the video shaky to seem more realistic . 'The general reaction is disbelief, . so I usually have to prove it by showing a wire frame of the entire shot . to prove that nothing is real.' Tsirbas said the 'real' elements to the film were the most difficult to create convincingly. The Los Angeles-based director said: 'Without a doubt the real stuff was the toughest because everybody . knows what an actual car driving down a desert should look like. 'Getting it mostly right wasn’t good . enough. We had to nail the car and desert perfectly, otherwise the gag . wouldn’t work. Getting the car, the scenery and the exposure right was vital to making the video realistic . Even the scenery was completely computer generated for the 30-second UFO hoax clip . The exposure was made to look imperfect in order to mimic the settings on an ordinary smartphone . 'Often CGI is too perfectly and uniformly exposed, when reality has . things blowing out or falling into darkness all over the place. 'The car interior was a beautiful model, . but I deliberately crunched down that element in the composite until it . was almost entirely black, because a real camera would do the same if . exposing for the sky.' Tsirbas worked on the hoax with students from the Gnomon School of Visual Effects, where he taught filmmaking classes and served as resident director of an original content division called Gnomon Studios.","Director and animator Aristomenis Tsirbas worked on Titanic and Star Trek .

"He was seriously wounded in the trenches and was later shot down by the Germans at 18,000ft – but throughout his experiences of the Great War, Arthur Greg kept his sense of humour. Now, the horrors faced by Arthur, who came from a wealthy mill-owning family in Cheshire, have been unearthed in an archive of letters and photographs. Like many other families, the Gregs, who built a number of thriving mills, including Quarry Bank in Styal, near Wilmslow, sent their men into battle for King and country in 1914. Letters discovered at Quarry Bank Mill have revealed a fascinating insight into the Greg family's loss during the First World War. Pictured is Arthur Greg seated in a plane . A letter, written by Arthur Greg, unearthed at Quarry Mill Bank in Cheshire by trainee archivist Laura Collins . A family photograph of the Gregs. Pictured are Henry Russell Greg surrounded by his six surviving children, Elizabeth Mary, Alice Caroline, Katharine Henry, Henry Philips, Mary Philips and Sarah Eleanor . Trainee archivist Laura Collins stumbled across the letters at the Mill among the family's extensive collection of . personal and business documents. They reveal how Arthur used a dry sense of humour to mask the horrors of what he endured. He wrote: 'Eighteen days in a fire . trench with heavy engagements only a few hundred yards to our right, and . more critical fighting a mile or so on our left, was not calculated to . act as nerve tonic.' Arthur Greg and his brother Robert were the sons of Ernest William Greg and their other brother, Alexander Carlton Greg, donated Quarry Bank Mill to the National Trust . Arthur was severely wounded after a shell dropped nearby during a German attack on the trenches. He . wrote: 'I went down like a log and was next aware of a loose, horrid . and disconnected feeling about the lower part of my face... At one time I . thought I should not live as I was bleeding so furiously. I thought it a . pity that one more so young should have to go.' Arthur and his brother Robert were the sons of Ernest William Greg and their other brother, Alexander Carlton Greg, donated Quarry Bank Mill to the National Trust. Barely a year after Arthur’s death in April 1917, Robert was stationed near Kummel when a shell was dropped directly on to his dug-out in the support line. Robert was fatally wounded and died days later on 3rd May 1918. Arthur began his military career at the age of 20, when in 1914 he was commissioned as Second Lieutenant of the 3rd (Special Reserve) Battalion Cheshire Regiment, serving as a bombing officer. In May 1915 he was attached to the First Battalion of the Cheshire Regiment, 15th Brigade, 5th Division, and was stationed in Ypres, Belgium. He led several reconnaissance missions, searching for enemy spies, often under heavy shell fire. In November of 1915, Arthur became a captain and in 1917 he was graded as a flying officer and posted to the British Expeditionary Force, 55 Squadron, Royal Flying Corps. But Arthur performed his final sacrifice on April 23, 1917, flying the DH4 bomber A7408. Arthur Greg's fiancee Marian Allen, who captured the bravery and grief of war in a poem written in 1918 .

"Your washing might smell fresh but don't be lulled into a false sense of cleanliness. The move away from the high-temperature washes and harsh detergents of our grandmothers’ era may be kinder to fabrics, the environment and sensitive skin but it could costing us our health. Research has shown that potentially harmful bacteria in our laundry is not being killed off in low-temperature washes, turning the average spin cycle into a breeding ground for germs. How clean is your laundry? Scientists say today's gentle washing methods create a 'bacteria soup' for clothes to swish around in and spread contagious bugs such as E.coli and Salmonella . The levels of bacteria found by microbiologists in our washing machines . and on supposedly ‘clean’ laundered clothes has led leading hygiene . expert, Dr Lisa Ackerley, to call for an increased awareness of what is . being termed the ‘Sick Laundry Cycle’. Dr Ackerley said: 'Consumers believe that normal laundering produces ‘clean’ clothes but this does not necessarily translate to ‘hygienically’ clean. 'The trend towards reducing washing temperatures and water volumes alongside using gentler detergents has affected the efficacy of the laundering process for reducing bacteria on contaminated clothing. It’s time to re-evaluate the hygiene of our laundry.' Do at least one cycle without any clothes in the machine at 90°C once a month to spring clean the interior of the appliance. Wash . bed sheets or underpants and socks in a separate wash from face . flannels and tea towels - especially during a low-temperature wash. Don’t shut your machine door immediately after a wash. Let it air to reduce the growth of bacteria inside. Regularly . clean your washing machine’s door seals and detergent drawer and wash . your hands thoroughly after handling heavily soiled laundry. If . washing at low temperatures without a laundry disinfectant then always . wash your hands after you take wet items out of the machine. In fact a microbial assessment to evaluate the infection risks associated with laundry found an estimated average of 0.1g grams (10,000 organisms) of faecal matter on every pair of ‘clean’ knickers. The Sick Laundry Cycle isn’t just about the inadequate removal of bacteria from contaminated clothes. Cross-contamination also plays a part. 'If you put something ridden with bacteria in the washing machine you will simply be swishing the germs around - creating a ‘bacterial soup’ - unless you do something to kill them. 'I am very concerned about bacteria from soiled underwear transferring onto items such as tea towels which are then used to wipe dishes,” says Dr Ackerley. Items that are most likely to be . contaminated with pathogens are those which come into direct contact . with the body - underwear, towels, facecloths, bedlinen and nappies. Bacteria . lurking inside washing machines can also be responsible for . cross-contamination: 'Studies have shown that a build-up of bacteria in . the interior of the washing machine transfers to the wash water of . subsequent cycles – with as many as one million bacteria found in just . two tablespoons of wash water. Bacteria from soiled underwear and dirty dishrags have been shown to get distributed to other pieces of clothing in the laundry load . 'Low-temperature washing provides optimal conditions for germs to breed and multiply in favourite hideaways such as the detergent drawer and door seals,' explained Dr Ackerley. In particular, the Sick Laundry Cycle is a problem if someone in the house is ill. Segregating clothes, bedding and towels infected by a bout of sickness from the rest of the household laundry isn’t enough to stop the risk of spreading infection if you are handling items washed at low temperatures. Dr Ackerley warned: 'Bacteria on wet clothes are more likely to contaminate hands. Thetransfer of germs from hands to objects in the home and ultimately our mouths is thereforea risk. 'By increasing our understanding of why bacteria are not always removed in the washingmachine, how they can cross-contaminate and the simple everyday steps needed toprevent potential sources of infection, the Sick Laundry Cycle can be broken.'","Low temperature cycles not strong enough to kill disease-causing bugs .

"Ed Miliband was tackled by a disgruntled voter yesterday who said people were deserting Labour because of the party’s failure to offer an EU referendum. In a rare non-stage-managed encounter with a member of the public, the Labour leader was told by an aircraft factory worker that voters wanted to have a say on whether Britain should continue its membership of the EU. In the awkward encounter, Peter Baldwin, an electrician at BAE Systems in Lancashire, told Mr Miliband: ‘This morning we sat in the brew room over there, your workers, and they are all leaning now towards Ukip. Confronted: Ed Miliband (right) was told by aircraft factory worker Peter Baldwin (left) that voters wanted to have a say on whether Britain should continue its membership of the EU . Ed Miliband was today confronted by a factory worker who warned him working class voters wanted a referendum on Europe . ‘The question on everyone’s mind is the referendum. I know what you are going to say but the working-class man in here wants to have a say. We have too many people here, that is why we have all got these people out of work.’ The Labour leader said that if he won office, he would make jobless EU migrants wait two years before claiming benefits and stop firms undercutting the minimum wage, before shaking Mr Baldwin’s hand and saying ‘very nice to meet you’. Mr Baldwin later told the BBC that he was referring to a chat between ‘20-odd working-class blokes’. He said: ‘Basically they are just not happy with Labour at the moment. The big thing with the working-class man is immigration and Europe.’ Mr Miliband was on a visit to the BAE site in Samlesbury and given a tour of its workshops, where the F35 Lightning II and Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft are built. His encounter with Mr Baldwin came as one of Labour’s biggest donors warned that failing to offer the public an in-out referendum could lose the party the election. John Mills, who has given £1.65 million to Labour, said Mr Miliband’s refusal to let the public have a say would ‘certainly’ cost the party votes in key seats. The multi-millionaire owner of retail business JML Ltd told a conference of Eurosceptics in London: ‘I have heard rumours that there is a majority in the Shadow Cabinet who are in favour of having a referendum. I’m sure one of the reasons for this is concern about whether refusing to have a referendum is going to lose Labour votes in what is going to be a very tight election.’ Nigel Farage is likely to jump on Mr Miliband's confrontation with a working class voter in Lancashire . John Mills, who has handed £1.65 million to Ed Miliband's party, has warned Labour could lose the election over Europe . Labour could lose the election by refusing to offer the public a referendum on the European Union, according to one of the party's biggest donors. John Mills, who has handed £1.65 million to Ed Miliband's party, said the Labour leader's refusal to let the public have a say would 'certainly' cost them votes in key seats. A multi-millionaire through his retail business JML Ltd, Mr Mills who is a longstanding Eurosceptic, said he had heard reports that a majority of Mr Miliband's shadow cabinet back an in-out poll. He also cautioned the party that refusing to dangle the threat of leaving the EU would grievously damage their chances of securing any reform to the way the 28-member union works. 'I have heard rumours that there is a majority of people in the shadow cabinet who are in favour of having a referendum', Mr Mills told a conference of Eurosceptics in central London. 'I'm sure one of the reasons for this is concern about whether refusing to have a referendum is going to lose Labour votes in what is going to be a very tight election. 'I think it certainly will and this is one of the major reasons why, from a tactical and strategic point of view, it is in the Labour party's interests to have a referendum sometime between 2015 and 2020.' The businessman was involved in the campaign against Britain's membership of the European Economic Community in 1975, when the Conservatives wanted to stay in and the Labour party was split. He said if there was another referendum, senior people in the Labour party should be allowed to campaign either way. 'What was agreed then [in 1975] was that each side of the Labour party could make speeches and campaign for what they thought was right. My guess is that something like that will happen again', he said. 'I think the unions will probably be split as well.' If Labour do win office, he said he did not rule out the party having a change of heart about holding a vote, saying: 'I don't think it's impossible….a referendum at some time in the next Parliament'. But he warned that party that failing to do so would backfire. Mr Miliband has effectively ruled out a referendum before 2020 saying it would only be trigged by a major transfer of new powers to the EU. His pro-European foreign affairs spokesman Douglas Alexander has said EU membership 'remains central to our prosperity and security' and that Labour would 'set itself the task of reviewing, repairing, and resetting our country's approach to Europe.' Mr Mills said this approach, if Mr Miliband wins, would 'inevitably weaken the UK's bargaining position'. He said: 'Minds in Brussels are much more likely to take renegotiation seriously if they know that there is a substantial risk that the UK will leave the EU if there is not a satisfactory deal on the table to persuade the UK to stay in. 'Whether they want to remain in the EU or they want to leave, there are many in the Labour Party who are united in their belief that the British people must be given an EU referendum to put this issue to bed once and for all.'","Ed Miliband was today confronted by a BAE factory worker in Lancashire .

"Mystery: Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens handed over an explosive dossier about a paedophile ring working from Westminster but the names remain a mystery . The explosive dossier compiled by MP  Geoffrey Dickens is believed to be among  114 files ‘potentially relevant’ to child abuse now known to have been lost or destroyed by the Home Office. In 1983 the Tory MP for Huddersfield West said he had eight names of 'really important, public figures' who unless they were arrested he would ‘expose  in Parliament’. Based on his descriptions, these are thought to include MPs, civil servants, a diplomat and even a Buckingham Palace official. Some had links to the Paedophile Information Exchange, who wanted sex with children legalised, he said. Dickens handed his '40-page dossier' to the then Home Secretary Leon Brittan, which set out allegations of a paedophile circle ‘operating and networking within and around’ the Westminster elite. Another copy was kept by Mr Dickens' wife and another was allegedly handed to the then Director of Public Prosecutions, Sir Thomas Hetherington and then the police. All the copies vanished and nothing came of the investigations but now the Dickens dossier is central to allegations that there was a high level cover-up to protect those in power. There has been speculation about who could have been named in it - MailOnline has considered who the MP could have implicated. Politicians . Was Smith named? Cyril Smith, a notorious paedophile MP, may have been in the dossier . In August 1983, Geoffrey Dickens told the Daily Express that he had given the names of ‘eight prominent figures’ to the Director of Public Prosecutions. He told the paper: ‘I’ve got eight names of big people, really important names, public figures.’ He said that, unless action was taken, he would ‘expose them in Parliament’. He added: ‘One of these people is a friend of mine, but you have to be merciless protecting the young. These people must not be allowed to get away with it just because they are important in public life.’ That 'friend' may have been Peter Morrison, who was Mrs Thatcher’s private secretary despite being described by fellow Conservative Edwina Currie as ‘noted pederast with a liking for young boys’. Morrison was also caught cottaging in public toilets with underage boys but instead of being pursued through the courts was released with a caution. He also went around public gardens 'cruising' for men to have sex with. He died after a heart attack in 1995 aged 51. In 2012 Rod Richards, a former Conservative MP and ex-leader of the Welsh Tories, said he had seen evidence linking Sir Peter Morrison to  North Wales children’s homes where up to 650 children were sexually, physically and emotionally abused over 20 years. Another MP in the dossier was likely to be Cyril Smith, the Liberal MP for Rochdale exposed as a paedophile after his death. Smith’s depravity knew no bounds and was probably known about at the very highest levels of the establishment, including the security services. But the plight of his victims was ignored on the grounds of ‘political expediency’. Police submitted files about Smith’s abuse of boys in his hometown of Rochdale in 1970, 1998 and 1999, but each time prosecutors recommended that no action should be taken against him. A senior Tory politician was also said to be part of a Westminster child sex ring, although he has not been named. The former MP was caught by customs with child porn videos after entering the UK at Dover after an official saw him 'acting suspiciously'. The tapes showed children 'clearly under the age of 12' being forced into sex but when the materials were handed to his bossed the man was never arrested or charged. Last night it emerged at least 12 men have come forward to accuse a Labour peer of abusing them when they were children. The . historical allegations against the man span several decades and include . accusations of rape and other serious sexual assaults. A . source familiar with the police investigation said at least a dozen men had . contacted officers to say they were abused by the peer, making a number . of ‘horrendous’ allegations. The . peer, who the Daily Mail is not naming for legal reasons, has not been . arrested or questioned in connection with the claims. It is not clear if he was known to Dickens. The Palace Official . Claims: Dickens told the News of the World in 1984 that a footman was abused by a royal official . Dickens' dossier is said to have made links between the Paedophile Information Exchange, a group that campaigned to make sex between adults and children legal, and an official who may have been linked to Buckingham Palace in some way. Dickens told the News of the World in 1984 that there was a cover-up at the Palace and a young footman was abused by a a royal official, which was covered up. The civil servant . Dickens said that a senior civil servant was helping to run a paedophile ring from Whitehall. The MP claimed the man had at least 57 obscene slides of men having sex with children. He said: 'I'm concerned about the cover-up of a senior civil servant who is a paedophile and wants sex with children legalised. He is a security risk'. Secret life: Sir Peter Hayman had a double identity he used to rent a flat to keep child pornography . The diplomat . In 1981 he used Parliamentary privilege to name diplomat Sir Peter Hayman, a decorated diplomat who lived a secret life as a paedophile. He was member ‘330’ of the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE), which supported and encouraged illegal sexual relationships between adults and children. He rented a flat at 95 Linden Gardens, Notting Hill Gate, London under the name of Peter Henderson to store PIE literature and graphic correspondence with fellow paedophiles. But Sir Peter made a mistake and left a packet of paedophile material in an envelope on a London bus. It was addressed to Mr Henderson at Linden Gardens in Notting Hill.Soon afterwards, in November 1978, police raided the Linden Gardens flat. What they found there was a huge trove of paedophilia and other extreme pornography. Among it was a library of 45 substantial diaries in which Sir Peter had recorded in detail his sexual experiences and fantasies, the latter including sex with minors. Even the hardened cops of the Obscene Publications Squad were ‘revolted’ by the Linden Gardens haul. He sobbed as he was interviewed and feared he would be exposed and his reputation ruined. And yet he wasn't. Much to the anger and disbelief of the Obscene Publications Squad he was let off with a caution. He died in 1992 aged 77.","Tory MP had 8 people he wanted to expose - but their names are a mystery .

"A TV ad screening in China, aimed at reminding people to be better behaved during their overseas trips, portrays tourists as pandas who publicly urinate, litter, intrude on photos and graffiti on trees. Set in Sydney, 'The Civilised Panda Travel Services' was created by advertising agency DDB China Group and was commissioned by Chinese state television broadcaster CCTV as a 'public service announcement'. In the bizarre video, pandas are seen engaging in rude and lewd behaviour while touring the sights the iconic Sydney Harbour has to offer. Scroll down for video . The Chinese advertisement is aimed at reminding people to be better behaved during overseas trip . In the video, a panda is seen sleeping and taking up an entire public park bench . An elderly woman comes along and wakes it up, and asks it to move over so she can sit down . The first scenario involves a panda snoozing and taking up an entire park bench before an elderly woman wakes it up. She gestures for him to move over and the panda complies. A second panda is then seen walking through a park while sipping on a bottle of water as a gardener is working. The finishes the bottle and disposes of it by throwing it over his shoulder, hitting the man tending to flowers who shakes his head when he realises what has happened. A panda is also seen urinating in public on a wall at iconic Sydney Harbour . Another panda is seen intruding on a photo two other tourists are taking in front of the Sydney Opera House .

"It can take years to master the violin or get to grips with the piano. But an electrical musical instrument in the form of gloves allows a wearer to make music using expressive and intuitive hand gestures. The Aura relies on sensors, a magnetic field and software to make futuristic noises, but to the untrained eye it looks a bit like magic. Scroll down for video . The gloves use a magnetic tracking system. They have small magnetic sensors attached to the fingers. Wearers wave their gloved hands over a magnetic 'base' which emits magnetic fields that the sensors on the gloves pick up. The gloves themselves do not make sound. They are essentially a midi device and simply send out data and different parameters that are interpreted by special computer software. Virtually any noise can be created. Wears control the noises created by spreading their hands apart to increase volume and raising and lowering them to control pitch accordingly. By closing the fingers, the Aura wearer activates flex sensors and muffles the sound, while twisting the hands adds distortion that makes the noises sound extra futuristic. ‘The goal was to create the most . intuitive instrument,’ said Ray Li, an engineering student at Cornell . University, Ithaca, New York, who came up with the idea of an instrument . played by gesturing in the air. Computer scientist Michael Ndubuisi . helped him bring it to life. The gloves are fitted with sensors that report their position and the orientation of the wearer’s hands in a magnetic field. Raising and lowering gloved hands controls pitch and spreading them apart increases volume. By closing the fingers, the Aura wearer activates flex sensors and muffles the sound, while twisting the hands adds distortion that makes the noises produced sound extra futuristic. Through an interface created by Mr Ndubuisi, hand positions are converted to signals in the universal Midi language for electronic instruments and fed to a synthesiser. The result looks something like a person listening to music and pretending to conduct, but the ‘conductor’ makes music by waving his hands in thin air. ‘We’re trying to capture those intuitive gestures and make music,’ Mr Li explained. The duo used magnetic sensors in the gloves that were originally developed for medical applications, motion tracking and manipulating 3D graphics. Before creating the Aura, Mr Li developed an electronic instrument that looked a bit like a cello, in which conductive strips replaced strings and a joystick held in the right hand controlled the sound. Mr Li (pictured) controls the noises created by spreading his hands apart to increase volume and raising and lowering them to control pitch accordingly. By closing the fingers, the Aura wearer activates flex sensors and muffles the sound, while twisting the hands adds distortion that makes the noises sound extra futuristic . He wanted to allow musicians to make noises in a more expressive way and came up with the idea of making Aura solely controlled by a person’s hands in thin air. The duo are building on the idea so that a person will be able to control recorded sounds of different instruments, provide visual representations and add percussion using body movements - all at once. ‘The musician will create a whole song on stage with nothing,’ Mr Li said.","Engineering students at Cornell University, New York, made the gloves that use a magnetic tracking system and can create virtually any sound .
The Aura enables wearers to make music using expressive and intuitive hand gestures so that music lessons are not required .

"A motorcyclist recorded the terrifying moment he veered off Britain's most dangerous road and tumbled down a 40-foot cliff - before escaping with only minor injuries. Jack Sanderson, 21, was riding his 600cc Kawasaki Ninja along a notorious stretch of the Cat and Fiddle road in the Derbyshire Peak District when it slewed out of control and veered off the road. A camera fitted to his helmet captured Mr Sanderson's view as he was thrown off his machine and repeatedly somersaulted down the hill. Scroll down for video . Jack Sanderson was filming his ride through the Derbyshire Peak District when the accident happened . The video shows him riding through winding country roads before narrowly missing a car and plunging over the edge . Anyone watching the film would fear the worst but, after the tumble, the amazing footage shows Mr Sanderson getting to his feet, dusting himself down and clambering back up the hill to greet concerned onlookers who had stopped to help. He cheated death with just mild concussion and a cut hand - caused when he grabbed some barbed wire as he walked to safety. The motorbike, which stopped at the top of the ridge, was written off and is being sold off for parts. Now Jack’s brush with death has become an internet sensation after he posted the video of the 60 mph near-miss on You Tube, where it has gathered more than 100,000 views. Mr Sanderson, an engineer from Knutsford, Cheshire, said: 'I can’t believe I walked out of that, not even with a broken bone. 'When I went over the ridge I was like helicopter spinning. I thought, this is it. I’m a gonner. After rounding a bend, Mr Sanderson's bike veers onto the wrong side of the road into the path of an oncoming car . Faced with a choice of hitting the car head-on or crashing over the edge, he steers off the road and towards the steep hill below . Sky and trees then swirl in the footage as Mr Sanderson tumbles down the 40-foot hill . The video shows the horrific moment Mr Sanderson spins down the hill, smashing through bushes and undergrowth . The camera finally comes to a rest in some long grass at the bottom of the hill after the fall . Mr Sanderson said the world went 'black and white' as he fell down the hill and time appeared to slow down . He said drivers and other bikers at the scene couldn't believe it when they saw him get up after the 40-ft fall . 'My bike stayed at the top of the ridge and I continued down. If my bike had followed me and crushed me, I would not be standing here today.' Mr Sanderson was was enjoying a Saturday ride when he under-steered on a corner and careered into the path of an oncoming Honda car. He added: 'I was going round the corner and I was going wider and wider and wider. When I saw the first bit of the car I knew I was in trouble. 'I chose to go off the cliff, rather than hit the car - it was the best thing I could do. I thought that was me dead. 'I opened my eyes at the bottom of the hill and everything was black and white. 'It was either hit them and possibly kill them or swerve off the ridge possibly killing myself. It is amazing how much time you actually have in those situations, or how slow time goes by.' Motorbike enthusiast Mr Sanderson said he 'thought he was a gonner' when he went over the edge . He went to hospital after the incident but only sustained mild concussion and a cut on his hand from some barbed wire . The couple in the silver Honda pulled over at the side of the ridge to check on Mr Sanderson only to be left stunned when he clambered up the cliff and said:  'I’m ok.' Mr Sanderson added: 'They were so gobsmacked to see me standing there, they could not believe it. ‘By the time they had got back to where it happened I popped back over the ridge. 'They were obviously very worried indeed. I did apologise to them as that must have been a dreadful ordeal for them. I suppose I felt somewhat invincible because I didn’t even have a broken bone and I walked away.' Mr Sanderson went to hospital the day after the incident last month and apart from some mild concussion and a cut on his hand from some barbed wire he unhurt and sent home the next day. Mr Sanderson hopes others will learn from his mistake. He said: 'I put it on You Tube as a kind of deterrent to others not to be as stupid as I was. 'I always have a Go-Pro camera on my head, it’s just for fun normally - but also there if anything more serious happens like this. 'For some reason I always go wide on that corner and I did it again and it nearly cost me my life. The Cat and Fiddle Road is one of the most dangerous roads in the country, mainly for bikers.' Mr Sanderson has put the video online as a warning to other motorcyclists to take care . He wants others to learn from his horrific experience in an area known for fatal motorcycle crashes . More than 100,000 people have seen his shocking video since he posted it online . He thinks that if his bike had not stayed at the roadside it could have landed on top of him and crushed him . The Cat and Fiddle road in Derbyshire has been branded Britain's most dangerous after a series of fatal accidents, many involving motorcyclists . 'It’s worth putting the video up on You Tube - even with the negative comments, if it stops others making the same mistake as me. 'It’s amazing how many people have seen the video. I put it on there as a warning to others as much as anything. I’m a good rider and we often think we are better than we are. If you are going to be stupid things like this will happen.' The A537 Cat and Fiddle Road between Macclesfield, Cheshire, and Buxton, Derbyshire has been repeatedly been branded Britain’s most dangerous due its severe bends and steep drops. The Road Safety Foundation charity report compared accident rates with the amount of traffic using the road and also found many of the crashes involved motorcyclists. The reports began in 2002 and since then the A537 has been top in eight out of 12 reports. There were 44 serious or fatal crashes on the seven-mile stretch of road between 2007 and 2011. Between 2002 and 2006, there were 35. Road safety experts have said the route’s 'grim reputation' is also part of the problem with bikers and motorists seeing it as a 'challenge.' Motorcycle friendly crash barriers have also been installed on one of the worst affected parts of the route. But Buxton mechanic Gary Ward, who recovers many of the vehicles after accidents on the road, said: 'Many of the crashes involve motorcyclists going too fast.' 'They often end up going down grass banking or hitting a wall - sometimes people do get away with scratches and bruises but most the time they are seriously injured. If they are going over 50mph it can be pretty bad for a biker.'","Jack Sanderson was riding in the Peak District when the accident happened .

"Former Home Secretary Leon Brittan was only questioned over allegations he raped a student in 1967 following demands by the Director of Public Prosecutions, it has been claimed. Alison Saunders is understood to have insisted the Metropolitan Police re-investigate claims Lord Brittan raped a 19-year-old woman at his London flat in 1967 because no questions were asked at the time. Lord Brittan was in his late 20s and not yet an MP at the time of the alleged incident, with police saying the woman originally made a complaint in late 2012. Today Lord Brittan released a statement confirming he was interviewed by police in relation to a 'serious allegation', but insisted that the allegation was 'wholly without foundation'. Scroll down for video . Allegations: The Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders (right) is understood to have insisted the Metropolitan Police re-investigate claims Lord Brittan (left) raped a woman at his London flat in 1967 . Denial: Lord Brittan (pictured leaving his North Yorkshire home this morning) has released a statement confirming he was interviewed by police, but insisted that the allegation was 'wholly without foundation' The Metropolitan Police only investigated claims Lord Brittan raped the student after the Director of Public Prosecutions demanded to know why he wasn't questioned when the alleged victim came forward, investigative news website Exaro claimed. As a result of Saunders' intervention, officers questioned Lord Brittan under caution in June at his solicitor's office and the allegations are now  being investigated by officers from the Metropolitan Police’s Sexual Offences, Exploitation and Child Abuse Command. Saunders is believed to have looked into the case herself after the campaigning Labour MP Tom Watson wrote to her asking that she examine the way the police handled the case. The Metropolitan Police has now replaced the officer in charge of the investigation, Exaro claims. This morning Lord Brittan released a statement confirming he had been questioned by police in June, but denying the allegations. 'It is true that I have been questioned by the police about a serious allegation made against me. This allegation is wholly without foundation,' he said. Investigation: Lord Brittan was in his late 20s and not yet an MP at the time of the alleged rape, with police saying the woman originally first made a complaint against him in late 2012 . In his statement Lord Brittan also referred to an 'explosive' dossier containing historic child abuse allegations against at least eight public figures was compiled by ex-Conservative MP Geoffrey Dickens, who died in 1995.

'I would like to put on record that I welcome the fact that there is now to be an independent review to look at the missing files belonging to the Home Office,' he said. 'It has been alleged that when I was Home Secretary I failed to deal adequately with the bundle of papers containing allegations of serious sexual impropriety that I received from the late Geoff Dickens MP,' he added. This too is completely without foundation... I passed this bundle of papers to the relevant Home Office officials for examination, as was the normal and correct practice,' Lord Brittan went on to say. This morning Prime Minister David Cameron said there would be 'no stone unturned' by an independent inquiry into how institutions handled allegations of child abuse, adding that it was 'vital' to find out the truth of what happened and to learn lessons.

"Top table tennis players often return ping pong balls at speeds of more than 100mph (161km/h). By their very nature, the ping pong balls are light and paddles are sturdy, but when fired at supersonic speeds, the whole dynamic changes. An air-powered bazooka has been designed that can fire the little white balls with so much power, they travel as fast as an F-16 fighter jet, with dramatic consequences for paddles that get in the way. Scroll down for video . Now that's a smash: A ping pong ball travelling at around 400 metres a second (Mach 1.2) hits a wooden paddle, travelling straight through it. This video is made in slow motion . Unveiled last year, the air bazooka is made from cheap materials such as plastic tubing and duct tape. It can fire ping pong balls as fast as 400 metres a second or Mach 1.2. Fighter jets typically cruise at Mach 1. The machine is so powerful because it uses a pressure chamber connected to a vacuum tube via a ‘convergent-divergent nozzle’. The hourglass-shaped nozzle is similar to what is used in fighter jets. When the pressured air rushes through the bottleneck it accelerates to supersonic speed as it helps propel the ball through the clear PVC barrel, its inventor explained. The light-weight ping pong balls fired from the gun can bore through wooden paddles, aluminium and even dent steel. John Huhn, from the Department of . Engineering at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, captured the . destruction of one paddle in slow motion, to show what happens when a lightweight ball meets a wooden paddle at supersonic speeds. The action can be seen in the video at 30,000 frames per second,The Blaze reported. In February last year, engineers from the university revealed their deadly weapon – an air-powered bazooka – that fires balls at more than 400 metres a second, or about Mach 1.2. The machine was created by an aeronautical engineer for the U.S. Air Force, Mark French with help from his graduate students at the university, Craig Zehrung and Jim Stratton. The team made the machine - that can blast balls clean though plywood or aluminium and deeply dent steel - using materials including plastic tubing and duct tape. Instructions: This diagram shows how the air bazooka was built. The machine can blast balls though plywood or aluminium and deeply dent steel, despite being built from materials including plastic tubing and duct tape . Game, set, match: John Huhn, from the Department of Engineering at Purdue University captured the destruction of one paddles in slow motion, to show what happens when a fragile ball meets a wooden paddle at supersonic speeds. This frame shows the paddle breaking at its handle after the speedy impact . Despite the low-tech materials, the machine can fire balls that break the sound barrier and can hit 919mph (1,479kph). The machine is so powerful because it uses a pressure chamber connected to a vacuum tube via a ‘convergent-divergent nozzle’. Dr French explained: ‘That hourglass-shaped nozzle is similar to what is used in fighter jets. When the pressurised air rushes through the bottleneck it accelerates to supersonic speed as it helps propel the ball through the clear PVC barrel.’ It is surprising that the lightweight balls - weighting just 0.08oz (2.3g) - can reach supersonic speeds because they have poor aerodynamics. Hole in one: Fired at close range, the ping pong ball blasts a hole through a traditional paddle at speeds of around 919mph (1,479kph) Supersonic: The ping-pong ball fired by the researchers at their lab in Indiana achieved speeds comparable to that of an F16 jet (pictured) racing across the landscape . But they can deliver enough energy to blast through targets equivalent to a brick falling from a tall building. ‘There is not enough money you could give me to get me to step in front of that gun,’ he said. The scientists explained that the ping pong gun is a popular tool for demonstrating acceleration and the power of pressure differentials in air when explaining concepts in physics lectures. 'It has even proven to be a challenging problem for computational fluid dynamics since it encompasses a range of aerodynamic phenomena that are particularly difficult to model,' Dr French said.","Professional table tennis players typically hit balls at 100mph (161km/h)

"Former Prime Minister Paul Keating has suggested a solution for young people who can’t afford their own home – to allow them to access their superannuation earlier. The 70-year-old one-time Labor party leader, said a shortage in financial help and houses available for first-time buyers was a position 'we cannot persist with'. Speaking at property investment company MaxCap Group’s Developers and Dealers Forum last week, Mr Keating said we are in a situation ‘where our children cannot afford to house themselves’. Scroll down for video . Former Prime Minister Paul Keating has suggested a solution to young people who can’t afford their own home . Offering up superannuation funds as a solution, he said: ‘Superannuation funds will have to do things in the spaces traditionally left to banks, such as property development, and we will see a shift in the balance in financing this industry,’ Property Observer reports. In August first home buyer activity hit a new low, with the worst sales levels in 15 years. There were 6,054 first home buyers committed to housing finance over the month, according to RP Data research which used finance data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. In August first home buyer activity hit a new low, with the worst sales levels in 15 years . At the moment, in most cases young people cannot access their superannuation before the age of 60 . The dramatic decline in people joining the property ladder has been blamed on rising property prices, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne. It has also been linked to changes made to the availability of First Home Buyer grants, which vary from state to state. The states showing the most severe first home buyer trends are NSW, Victoria, Queensland and the ACT. At the moment most young people cannot access their superannuation before the age of 60 unless they satisfy one of 14 conditions of release. These conditions include severe financial hardship, death, permanent disability and compassionate grounds.","Former Prime Minister Paul Keating has stuck up first-time buyers .

"A family found their missing pet tortoise in a store room more than 30 years after they lost her, it was reported today. Manuela disappeared from her home in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1982 and despite a lengthy search was never seen again. Her owners, the Almeida family, assumed she had run away after builders working on the house left the front door open. Turtle-ly delighted: The Almeida family plays with their pet tortoise Manuela 30 years after she disappeared from their home in Rio de Janeiro . It was only after their father Leonel died earlier this month that the Almeida children began clearing out a second-floor room which he had filled with broken electrical items and always kept locked. Leonel's son, Leandro, said he was astonished to find Manuela alive inside a box containing an old record player. He told Brazil's Globo G1 website said: 'I put the box on the pavement for the rubbish men to collect, and a neighbour said, ""you're not throwing out the turtle as well are you?"" 'I looked and saw her. At that moment, I turned white, I just couldn't believe what I was seeing.' Alone time: Manuela was finally discovered alive inside a box containing an old record player when the family decided to clear out a locked store room (above) Red-footed tortoises are popular pets in South America because they are relatively inexpensive and have interesting personalities. In the wild, they mainly live in dry forest areas and grasslands and feed on fruit, leaves, dead animals and even faeces. They have a life expectancy of around 50 years. As pets, it is recommended that they are housed outdoors when conditions allow. They are particularly resilient as they can survive for up to three years without food. But they are also at risk from humans as the species is considered a delicacy in many cities of South America. Daughter Lenita, who had been given the . tortoise as a childhood pet, said: 'Everything my father thought he . could fix, he picked up and brought home. 'If he found an old television he thought he might be able to use a part of it to fix another one in the future, so he just kept accumulating things. We never dared go inside that room. 'We're all thrilled to have Manuela back. 'But no-one can understand how she managed to survive for 30 years in there, it's just unbelievable.' Rio de Janeiro vet Jeferson Pires explained that Manuela's red-footed species of tortoise, can go for long periods without eating. He said: 'They are particularly resilient and can survive for two to three years without food. In the wild they eat fruit, leaves, dead animals, even faeces.' He said Manuela may have survived by eating termites from the wooden floors.","Manuela disappeared from her home in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1982 .

"A feckless father who has 18 children by ten women says his human rights have been violated – because council bosses only gave him a four-bedroom house. Peter Rolfe, 64, says the town hall has a ‘duty of care’ to upgrade him and his large brood to a six-bedroom home on the Isle of Wight. A larger property would be worth at least £300,000 but Mr Rolfe, who has not worked for more than 20 years, lives off benefits and claims he had to give up work to care for his offspring. On handouts: Peter Rolfe (seated left), five of his children, two children, and his son-in-law Daniel Beck, who stays at the house four nights a week. Mr Rolfe says the council has a duty of care to give them more space . The single father says his current home is too cramped for himself and the five children and two grandchildren who live there – son Peter, 19, daughters Rose Anne, 18, Marie Anne, 15, Carrie Anne, 14, Leeanne, 17, and her one-year-old twins Lexi and Courtney. Mr Rolfe said: ‘They are making out I’m a bum. Why does it matter that I’m on benefits? ‘They are discriminating against me and the kids. The council has a duty of care, to make sure we have a decent place to live. ‘They have abused my human rights. They are treating me and my children like second class citizens.’ Mr Rolfe said the family like their home in Newport, but claims one room is covered in mould and the fourth bedroom is so small it ‘may as well be a cabinet’. Their living conditions become desperate when four of his other children come to visit at weekends and have to sleep in the living room, he said. The father of Leeanne’s twins Daniel Beck, 24, also stays four nights a week to help take care of his children. Plea: The family says this four-bedroom house in Newport is too cramped and in poor condition . None of the children who are of working age have jobs and Mr Rolfe says he relies instead on state handouts like housing benefit and child tax credit to get by. He said: ‘They are all in further education so they can get some qualifications and get good jobs.’ Mr Rolfe, who claims to have nine further children – with whom he no longer has contact – added: ‘I have 18 children with about ten women. I made some mistakes when I was younger but now I’ll do anything to make my kids happy. ‘I hate to see the children have no . space, no privacy. They have nowhere to do their homework so they are . doing badly at school.’ - Peter Rolfe, 64 . ‘Getting a larger house would mean the world to us. It would mean we could get some peace  and space.’ He said: ‘I hate to see the children have no space, no privacy. They have nowhere to do their homework so they are doing badly at school.’ Incredibly, Mr Rolfe successfully complained to the Local Government Ombudsman that the property, which he moved into in September 2011, was too small. The watchdog agreed that one of the rooms was too tiny to be legally classed as a bedroom and ruled that Mr Rolfe and his family had suffered a serious injustice as a result of failings by the Isle of Wight Council. However the authority this week rejected the ombudsman’s recommendation to pay the family £1,000 in compensation and bump them to the top of the housing register because it was against policy. Members agreed a lesser amount of £250 was sufficient. Councillors in Newport, Isle of Wight, have blasted Mr Rolfe's request, claiming he is working the system to his own advantage. They have also rejected an ombudsman recommendation to pay him £1,000 compensation . Cllr Gordon Kendall, the authority’s cabinet member for housing, said Mr Rolfe was ‘operating the system to his own advantage’. Mr Rolfe said: ‘I spent two years pursuing the case with the ombudsman and the council have ignored his report. ‘What is the point of an ombudsman if all the council do is ignore the findings? They’re basically sticking two fingers up at the whole process.’ However, Mr Rolfe may yet get his dream home. The council says it does not have any six-bed homes available but is now considering buying a property big enough for them – or  knocking two together to create one large house. He said: ‘I don’t care about the money, it is about the children and their human right to live. ‘It’s an ongoing injustice but I will never give up on my children.’","Peter Rolfe, 64, says town hall has 'duty of care' to upgrade his family .

"Group Captain Wendy Williams, 54, claimed that she was wrongly passed over for a top RAF job in favour of a male colleague with less experience than her . The Royal Air Force's most senior nurse who lost out on a top job to a man has won a sexual discrimination case against the Ministry of Defence. Group Captain Wendy Williams, 54, took the RAF to tribunal after she was passed over for promotion in favour of a male doctor who had three-and-a-half years' fewer service than her. Today, in what is being hailed a landmark ruling, Group Capt Williams' claim that the MoD had discriminated against her when recruiting for a senior role because of her gender was upheld. The tribunal, which found that just six of the 470 top jobs in the RAF were held by women last year, agreed with Group Capt Williams' claim and awarded her damages. She brought the case in July 2011 after being passed over for the position as RAF candidate for the tri-service role of commodore of the Defence Medical Group. As a registered nurse and midwife who had served in the RAF since 1984, and who had been a group captain since 2003, Group Capt Williams expected to win the role. But despite her experience, and her being recommended for promotion to a senior non-nursing role based on her experience, the post went to Group Capt John Gaffney. The 1* level role went to Group Capt Gaffney despite him having three-and-a-half years fewer service as a Group Captain. Group Captain Williams claimed the MoD had breached the 2010 Equalities Act by discriminating against her because of her gender when recruiting for a role for which she recommended and well-qualified. The tribunal was told that it was the . RAF’s procedure to fill medical 1* roles that were theoretically open . to doctors and nurses only with doctors. The Royal Air Force only had six women in its 470 top jobs last year, the tribunal heard . In its ruling, the tribunal panel, . led by employment judge Veronica Dean, criticised the RAF for this . practice and also the low number of women in top ranks overall - . amounting to between 1% and 1.3% of the total. Group Capt Williams said she was pleased with the decision, saying: 'Following this decision, I hope that nurses in the Royal Air Force and the wider Armed Forces will have the opportunity to aspire to, and attain, more senior posts. 'I hope that nurses will also gain due recognition for their leadership, commitment and professionalism. 'This judgment represents an opportunity for the Armed Forces to scrutinise internal processes and practices and shatter glass ceilings. The tribunal panel criticised Air Vice Marshal Mike Lloyd, now retired, for his ignorance of legislation . 'It should be used as a platform to ensure that appointments are made with regard to merit and competencies, and not with regard to a person’s gender or their membership of a professional body.' The panel also included scathing criticism of several senior officers, including Air Vice-Marshal Chris Morris who gave the promotion board a 'partisan and not unbiased' assessment of Group Capt Gaffney, who was under his command at the time. Air Vice Marshal Mike Lloyd, who is now retired but was in charge of RAF personnel at the time, was also criticised for his lack of knowledge of discrimination legislation, an ignorance that left the tribunal panel 'incredulous'. 'Viewed with an objective eye against the job specification, we have considered all the evidence and find that for a number of reasons the claimant was not only equal to Group Captain Gaffney but that an objective review of her appraisals and those of Group Captain Gaffney would have led to the claimant being considered as the properly preferred candidate of the RAF,' it wrote in its ruling. 'While the respondents acknowledge that both the claimant and Group Captain Gaffney were competent candidates for the selection... the respondents assert that Group Captain Gaffney was the most likely to succeed in competition with the other candidates put forward by the other services and therefore he was selected on that basis. 'We consider such a rationale to be entirely subjective and unsustainable in the evidence before us and we conclude that the claimant was not selected because of her sex.' Group Capt Williams was supported by the Royal College of Nursing in her claim. Janet Davies, its executive director of nursing and service delivery, said: 'This is a landmark case, and bodes well for the future of nursing careers within the Armed Forces. 'It isn’t right for female staff to be placed at a disadvantage when they get to a senior level. 'The tribunal was clear - not only was Wendy Williams suitable to be put forward for this role, but an objective review would have led to her being considered as the preferred candidate. 'We hope that the Ministry of Defence will take on board the recommendations which come out of this tribunal so that the talents of female officers and nurses in particular are valued and harnessed in the future.'","Group Captain Wendy Williams, 54, lost top RAF job to male colleague .

"The ordeal for one of the victims began after she became desperate for love and attention because she was forced to care for her sick parents. So when Mohammed Karrar entered her life, bought her perfume and treated her like an adult, she believed in him. But the ‘nicey-nicey honeymoon period,’ as she described it, would last barely a year. After grooming her, Karrar made sure she was ‘out of it’ on drink and drugs before raping her on his sofa. Abuse: Mohammed Karrar, 38, left,  and his brother Bassam Karrar, 33, right, forced the young girl to have sex with one of them while she performed a sex act on the other . From that moment she became his ‘property’ and a sex slave loaned out to abusers around the country for up to £600 an hour. Over five years she was repeatedly attacked in what she described as ‘torture sex’. Injected with heroin, she was sold to groups of Asian men who violently gang-raped her in bedsits and guesthouses around Oxford and elsewhere. The victim identified as Girl D for legal reasons, frequently broke down in tears giving evidence via videolink as she described her horrific ordeal. Following the rape, Karrar’s sadistic attacks became commonplace and sometimes he made ‘porn’ movies of her. If she refused, he would beat her up and threaten her with weapons, once beating her with a baseball bat. He even raped the girl, who came from a troubled family, at the home she shared with her parents. Abuse was carried out at the Nanford Guest House in Oxford. Pictured is a room at the guest house . Karrar and his brother Bassam, who have been found guilty along with five other men of a string of sex crimes, forced her to have sex with one of them while she performed a sex act on the other. Sobbing . as she recalled telling Karrar about her pregnancy, she . said: ‘He was f***ing fuming. He said I should have been a bit more . responsible.’ Given . two ‘ecstasy-like’ tablets, she was driven to a house in Reading where . she was forced to undergo an illegal abortion using a long hook. The teenager said she could not remember much of the procedure, but . believes it took place on a hard living room floor. No doctors or nurses . were present, there were no painkillers or medication.On one occasion, Karrar branded her flesh with hot metal. ‘He was branding me so that if I ever had sex with someone else, people would know I was his,’ she said. Convicted: Seven members of a paedophile ring were found guilty at the Old Bailey yesterday of a catalogue of charges involving vulnerable underage girls who were groomed for sexual exploitation . Over the following four years Karrar took the girl around the country and sold her for ‘£600 a time’. She was made to wear short skirts and bikini tops before being repeatedly raped. Parties were held at which she was asked to meet the sexual requirements of up to 15 ‘important guests’. She later moved into a foster family away from Oxford and the nightmare stopped.Two years later she met Karrar after he convinced her he had changed. During a conversation at his home she demanded to know why he had abused her and sold her for sex. He became angry and raped her a final time. One victim said she had been so brainwashed by her abusers that even now she sometimes failed to see the evil in the men who had raped her. Known only as ‘Girl Three’, she endured three years of abuse at the hands of the gang. ‘It was brainwashing. Even to this day I can almost say, “They were OK”,’ she said. ‘It’s delusional. They turned me against my mum. They knew everything that they had to say to get a vulnerable person, a young person, on their side.’ Like many of the victims, she had experienced abuse as a child and was in care. She was later adopted but rebelled by running away and drinking.","Mohammed Karrar plied girl with drink and drugs and raped her .

"A woman diagnosed with MS after losing the ability to walk claims her symptoms were actually the result of mercury poisoning from dental fillings. Eighteen months after Maria Indermuhle had dental treatment, doctors told the 32-year-old she had the lifelong crippling illness multiple sclerosis. They warned the then 29-year-old the condition would leave her unable to walk and prepared her for a life on medication - crushing her dreams of becoming a mother. But Mrs Indermuhle, who is from Inverness but lives in Switzerland, is now back to full health, having had the fillings she claims were responsible, removed. Scroll down for video . Eighteen months after having mercury dental fillings, Maria Indermuhle, pictured with her husband Jacques, was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. She was unable to walk, and was suffering vision loss and weakness in her hands, but tests revealed the then 29-year-old had mercury poisoning . Mrs Indermuhle said she has never been in contact with mercury, other than when she had the fillings fitted. NHS Scotland said amalgam fillings, which are made of mercury mixed with silver, copper and tin, are safe to use. The Scottish Government has paid more than £400,000 since 2008 to have thousands of the fillings removed from patients who have suffered an adverse reaction. Mrs Indermuhle, who married her husband Jacques, 36, three years ago, left her home in Inverness for a new life in Switzerland. But her plans for a life abroad soon came crashing down, as her health deteriorated. She said: 'I started to feel such a strange sensation in my body. 'I started to have pins and needles in my legs and then it started to happen in my hands. Just 18 months later, I could hardly walk. 'I started having panic attacks, collapsing in the street, lost the feeling in my hands, started losing my vision, began slurring my words, I couldn’t concentrate on anything. I couldn’t grasp French. 'I experienced palpitations, and I actually could feel like my brain was moving. 'I started having hallucinations during the night. It was terrifying. I could feel my body was breaking down and not working. I actually thought I was dying.' The 32-year-old said she 'almost died' and urged people with MS to check their symptoms are not the result of a similar poisoning . The interior designer said she wants to raise awareness of the similarity between the symptoms of mercury poisoning and MS, to help prevent other people going through the ordeal she endured. For a year, Mrs Indermuhle was in and out of hospital as doctors tried to establish what was wrong with her. In October 2012 she was diagnosed with MS. She said: 'I was told MS was a progressive disease and that I would get sicker and I would have to inject myself with meds every day for the rest of my life and eventually be in a wheelchair. 'I had a tearful weekend after that diagnosis. I was terrified. I felt completely alone, although my husband was great and very supportive.' Three weeks before Mrs Indermuhle married her husband in Inverness, she had several mercury fillings inserted by an NHS dentist. She claims she immediately sensed something was wrong, tasting metal in her mouth straight after the treatment. 'I brought this to the dentist’s attention but I was informed it was nothing to worry about,' she said. 'For six weeks after that, I couldn’t taste my food. 'I arrived in Switzerland and I just got sicker and sicker. But I refused to believe that this was the end. I had only just married. 'Then one day, I found the missing piece of the jigsaw. I discovered that mercury poisoning has the same symptoms as MS. 'I found a doctor here in Switzerland who is a metal testing doctor. He did various tests and they came back confirming that my body was full of mercury. I did indeed have mercury poisoning.' After contacting NHS Highland, Mrs Indermuhle received a letter expressing sympathy for her problems, but the health authority has not admitted responsibility. An NHS Highland spokesman, said: 'We are very sorry that Mrs Indermuhle has experienced health problems . and the impact it has had on her life. 'The . dental treatment she received was carried out under the NHS General . Dental Services Scotland Regulations which recognise amalgam as the . material of choice for prosterior teeth. 'We . have been contacted by Mrs Indermuhle and have fully investigated and . responded to her complaint. She has also been advised of the contact . details for the Ombudsman should she remain unhappy with our complaint . response.' Mercury has for centuries been used in medicine, to make amalgams - substances formed when mercury reacts with another metal. They are commonly used in dentistry to create fillings, when mercury is combined with silver, tin and copper. Those who suffer high exposure to the metal can develop mercury poisoning. Mercury is a heavy metal, which in all its forms, can produce toxic effects in high enough doses. Severe poisoning can cause kidney failure, respiratory failure, damage to the brain and lungs, and even death. The symptoms of mercury poisoning include: . Children suffering mercury poisoning may also suffer: . Mercury poisoning is also thought to be linked to mental health problems. In the 1800s the phrase 'Mad Hatter' originated after people realised hatters, who used mercury to process felt for hats, often suffered mental health issues. A Scottish Government spokesman . added: 'The Scottish Government believes that amalgam fillings are safe . to use, which is a view supported by the other UK health departments and . the British Dental Association. 'If . there is a proven allergic reaction to a constituent metal of an . amalgam filling which is causing oral symptoms for the patient, a . consultant may recommend replacement of the amalgam fillings. 'This . is quite rare and fewer than 0.04 per cent of the 1,007,169 fillings . placed in 2012-13 were removed on the recommendation of a consultant.' Mrs Indermuhle, said: 'I was told by NHS Highland that the ombudsman cannot normally . look at a complaint more than 12 months after you became aware of the . matter. 'I couldn’t have been in touch before that or within 12 months . because I didn’t know that my ill health was due to the dental treatment . I had in March 2011.' Mrs Indermuhle said she wants to raise awareness of the similarities between the symptoms of MS and those of mercury poisoning. She said: 'It’s very interesting and terribly sad and worrying that the highest amount of MS sufferers are seemingly in the UK. 'Mercury . poisoning has the same symptoms as MS, so maybe many men and woman are . suffering like I was and it’s not MS at all, but mercury poisoning. 'If anyone has MS, I would be asking myself the question, do they have mercury fillings and if so, get them out. 'However, . it’s crucial that mercury fillings are removed safely and that certain . natural supplements are taken before the treatment. 'And . it’s not enough to just get the black fillings removed, you then have . to do a big detox and this is best done with the help and support of a . professional.' The 32-year-old, who is considering pursuing a course at a holistic college in Edinburgh, said she and her husband's plans to have children are now back on track. She said: 'It’s now over three years since I got sick after my dentist appointment. 'However, I have such a big awareness now of things I knew nothing about before. I eat differently and it’s now extremely important to me what I put in my body. 'I am just so sorry I ever accepted having mercury amalgam fillings to be put in my mouth. If I had only known then what I know now. I have removed all my mercury fillings from my mouth. 'I have done a big detox and haven’t touched any medications. It’s all been natural. All of those dreadful MS symptoms have gone. 'There is no time I was ever exposed to mercury other than when I was at the dentist. 'I live and love every day of my life more than I’ve ever done.'

"A Russian student nurse is facing expulsion after uploading pictures of herself holding human organs during operations and mocking patients on social media. Gulnaz Yalalova, 20, is seen holding a spleen in one image and also uploaded a snap of a seriously injured hand before making fun of the teenage patient while working at a hospital in Kazan, 500miles east of Moscow. Yalalova was observing the surgery of a 16-year-old girl who had fallen from an apartment building when she took the pictures, later calling the patient a ‘275lbs schizo’. Inexcusable: Student nurse Gulnaz Yalalova Instagrammed pictures from a surgery during her work experience and mocked the patient in the comments . The student nurse uploaded the images to her Instagram and engaged in conversation with her friends in the comment section, revealing personal details about the patient. The surgery at Kazan Regional Clinical Hospital involved a 16-year-old female who fell from an eighth floor window in the Russian city. As the images of the patient's organs were posted on the web, a friend asked Yalalova: ‘Are you having fun there?’ The third year trainee nurse, who wore full surgical dress for the picture replied: ‘We sure are. 'Look, we do not sleep at night. By the way, the girl is 16. Jumped from the eighth floor.’ Bad doc: The 20-year-old posed holding the spleen of a 16-year-old female and took pictures during the young woman's life-saving surgery at the hospital in Kazan, Tatarstan . Breach of trust: Although the 16-year-old patient may have been injured in an attempted suicide, Ualalova branded her a'275lbs schizo' along with the pictures from the teenager's surgery . The friend said: ‘Nasty. How is she?’ Yalalova, a student of Kazan Medical College, said: ‘In a hard condition - broken ribs, legs, head injuries, spleen is torn, easier to say what is OK. ‘She's a “Schizo”, weighs over 275lbs’ The friend replied: ‘Well now I see why she did it.’ The images has now been brought to light, and Yalalova has been banned from returning to work at the hospital and may be excluded from her degree. ‘I totally disapprove of this. It is a horrible case,’ Regional Clinical Hospital director Rustem Gaifullin said. ‘It was a serious surgery, the young woman fell from the eight floor. The team of doctors saved her life and this girl left the operation scene to take photos. ‘Of course she will never come back here for medical practice. ‘It is a matter of choosing people as medics of the future. The medical college must understand this.’ Rapped: The student, who has since removed her Instagram account, has been banned from returning to do work experience at Kazan Regional Clinical Hospital . The director of prestigious Kazan Medical College,  Zukhra Khisamutdinova, said: Gulnaz entered our college in 2012. Now she is a third year student, studying to be a nurse. ‘ . ‘We had never problems with her as a student,’ she said. ‘It is the first such case in the 177-year history of our college. Of course, social networks appeared not long ago. She added: ‘There are internal rules for the students, about behaviour and clothes, but there are no rules about social networks. We could not even imagine such a thing could happen one day.’ The college director said it was now an ‘open question’ whether Yalalova would remain as a trainee nurse. Sergei Petrushin, a psychology lecturer at Kazan University, said: ‘I think it is a sign of emotional and social immaturity, inanity. ‘It is just like when little children do not quite understand what they are doing. ‘Her age tells us she is an adult, but in terms of psychology, the girl just does not understand that this is not right.’ He claimed: ’It is a general problem of our young people. They are immature, their ethical boundaries are not fixed. ‘They hardly understand what is good and bad. But anyone can make a mistake. ‘If the girl thinks deeply about this mistake and realises what she did, she can still be a nurse in the future.’","Gulnaz Yalalova, 20, pictured holding human organs during surgery .

"Ched Evans has insisted he was guilty only of infidelity - not the rape he was jailed for - as he apologised to his girlfriend in a new video and pleaded for a 'second chance' in football. The 25-year-old former Sheffield United player made the comments on YouTube as his girlfriend Natasha Massey clutched his arm and wore what appeared to resemble an engagement ring. It is the first time he has spoken since his release from prison on Friday after serving half of a five-year sentence he received for raping a 19-year-old woman in his home town of Rhyl, North Wales. Scroll down for video . 'Determined': Ched Evans pleaded for a second chance to play football again - and insisted he was innocent . Relationship: Evans' girlfriend Natasha Massey, who stood by him throughout the trial which found him guilty of rape, clutched his arm in the video and wore a gold-coloured band on the ring finger of her left hand (circled) In the statement he said he has 'constantly regretted my act of infidelity and the damage that has been done on so many fronts because of it'. But he said he was 'determined to continue to fight to clear my name' and has now submitted his case to the Criminal Cases Review Commission. As he made the video address dressed in a black shirt and tie, his girlfriend clutched his arm, a gold-coloured band visible on the ring finger of her left hand. 'I made an incredibly foolish decision and failed those people who trusted and believed in me - most of all, Tasha and our families,' Evans added. 'It is a rare and extraordinary privilege to be permitted to play professional football. Now that I've served the custodial part of my sentence of two and a half years, it is my hope that I will be able to return to football. 'If that is possible, then I would do so with humility having learned a very painful lesson. I would like a second chance but I know not everyone would agree. Evans, left in his police mugshot and right this week after his release, maintains he was innocent . Attention: The statement came days after Evans was released from Wymott Prison in Preston (pictured) Evidence: Evans' victim on CCTV at the hotel in his home town of Rhyl, North Wales, on the night of the assault . 'I don't believe I have a given right to play again, but for any club to take me on, I've learned a valuable lesson and know that, over time, I can prove myself to be a positive influence, not just on the pitch but also in the community.' Evans was driven out of Wymott Prison in Preston in a Mercedes 4x4 at 5am on Friday amid rumours he had been offered a contract by his old club, Sheffield United, worth more than £500,000. Released: Evans and his girlfriend Natasha enjoy his freedom on Monday in Alderley Edge, Cheshire . Sheffield United denied the report in The Sun, calling it 'false and damaging to the Club'. Evans was jailed for five years in 2012 after being convicted of raping a drunken 19-year-old after a former team-mate invited her back to a hotel room in his home town of Rhyl. He admitted having sex with her, but insisted it was consensual. The woman told the jury she had no memory of the incident. An online petition against Evans returning to Sheffield United has gained more than 150,000 signatures. The release of the two-minute video  came hours after the BBC was forced to apologise after BBC presenter and veteran journalist Michael Buerk appeared to criticise Evans' victim for being drunk. In a trailer for Radio 4 discussion show Moral Maze on the rehabilitation of criminals, Buerk said neither footballer Evans nor the woman he attacked emerged ""with any credit"" because she was so intoxicated 'she could barely stand'. His comments have incensed victims' rights campaigners who described the trailer as 'damaging' and 'deeply offensive'. A Radio 4 spokesman said: 'There was no intention to suggest that the victim was in any way at fault, and we apologise if the way this live trail was phrased suggested this. 'Tonight's Moral Maze will ask whether a convicted rapist who maintains his innocence should be entitled to get his job back.' There was also controversy after TV host Judy Finnigan said the disgraced footballer should be allowed to return to Sheffield United. She and her daughter Chloe both received rape threats online after she told the Loose Women programme the footballer should get his job back. She had added the victim was ‘drunk’ and the rape was ‘unpleasant’ but ‘not violent’. Ms Massey (right) has led a campaign to have Evans' conviction overturned in a case review . Evans, pictured in action for Sheffield United, wants to restart his career after serving a sentence for rape . Katie Russell, for Rape Crisis England and Wales, said after the BBC controversy today: 'To infer that being drunk is in any way ""morally"" comparable to committing the serious and violent crime of rape is deeply offensive and will undoubtedly have caused considerable distress to the huge numbers of survivors of sexual violence who will inevitably have been listening. 'Let us not forget that there is a rape survivor at the heart of this story, who is currently living with the devastating and potentially lifelong impact not only of having been sexually violated but of the terrible abuse she has subsequently suffered in the public domain. 'It is partly because of the kind of shaming, victim-blaming attitudes voiced by Michael Buerk this morning that currently only 15 per cent of all those who are raped choose to report to the police.' 'In May 2011 in a hotel in North Wales, by cheating on my partner Natasha I hurt the woman I love with all my heart. 'Since that night I've constantly regretted my act of infidelity and the damage that has been done on so many fronts because of it. 'Foolish': Evans with his girlfriend Natasha Massey . 'The support that's been shown by Natasha, our friends and family during the trial and the time spent in prison has kept me strong. 'It can't have been an easy thing to stand by someone who the court found guilty of such a destructive act. I will be forever grateful. 'Even though I've been released from prison I'm determined to continue to fight to clear my name and it is public knowledge that an application to refer my case back to the Court of Appeal has recently been submitted to the Criminal Case Review Commission by my lawyers. 'The application seeks to demonstrate that the acts I engaged in on that night were consensual in nature and not rape. 'I made an incredibly foolish decision and failed those people who trusted and believed in me - most of all, Tasha and our families. 'It is a rare and extraordinary privilege to be permitted to play professional football. 'Now that I've served the custodial part of my sentence of two and a half years, it is my hope that I will be able to return to football. 'If that is possible, then I would do so with humility having learned a very painful lesson. I would like a second chance but I know not everyone would agree. 'I don't believe I have a given right to play again, but for any club to take me on, I've learned a valuable lesson and know that, over time, I can prove myself to be a positive influence, not just on the pitch but also in the community.

"Nigel Farage has condemned a phone app made by schoolchildren featuring a character called Nicholas Fromage kicking immigrants off the white cliffs of Dover. The UKIP leader said the game where players kick immigrants as far as possible to gain the highest 'racism' rating is 'risible and pathetic' and 'crosses the line'. But Canterbury Academy principal Phil Karnavas said the technology class' project was 'just a bit of fun'. Scroll down for video . A phone app made by schoolchildren features a character called Nicholas Fromage kicking immigrants off the white cliffs of Dover . The student developers, who have formed game design company FonGames, say the game called Ukik aims to 'make a mockery of extremist views'. Mr Farage said he accepted criticism as a public figure but attacked the implication Ukip was racist. He said: 'Those elements are risible and in many ways pathetic. I think I'm quite well known for having a sense of humour. I'm a public figure and of course people are going to have views. But elements of this game appear to cross the line.' He added: 'Fair play to them for having a bit of fun. If they want to go away and look at Ukip policies, they will actually learn a lot.' The game features an apparent manifesto from the fictional Nicholas Fromage, Ukik leader, saying: 'If you are feeling irrational and want to live in a right wing hell hole then vote UKIK this May. 'These people might improve our economy, contribute to our culture and make Britain great but they are different to us so let's kick them all out!' The student developers, who have formed game design company FonGames, say the game called Ukik aims to 'make a mockery of extremist views' Mr Farage said he accepted criticism as a public figure, but elements of the same - such as the use of the term 'racism' - were unacceptable . The migrant-kicking 'Ukik' game was developed by a group of 18-year-old students from Canterbury Academy - John Brown, James Dupreez, Fraser Richardson, John Hutchinson and Joe Brown. It is available on Google Play, where it has been given a five-star rating by 60 players. According to the game's disclaimer, it was developed to 'highlight the importance of a diverse culture for our great nation as well as make a mockery of extremist views'. Its description reads: 'If you are feeling irrational and want to live in a right wing hell hole then vote UKIK this May.' Principal Mr Karnavas said: 'It's certainly topical and should stimulate discussion about political issues amongst young people - something we are constantly told is important. 'But, really as political satire it is just a bit of fun. Many politicians don't need help to make themselves look daft, or to say very silly things, but they should at least have the ability to laugh at themselves. 'This game may be a bit 'edgy' but I suspect it will not bring the British political system crashing down!' The game has been developed by 18-year-olds John Brown, James Dupreez, Fraser Richardson, John Hutchinson and Joe Brown. The group are all learning coding, graphic design and game development and have been making mobile games about spaceships and platform games. FonGames describes itself as 'a team of developers who create games based upon controversial news stories for the purposes of entertainment and to encourage political discussion amongst young people.' Canterbury Academy principal Phil Karnavas said the technology class' project was 'just a bit of fun' Marcus Ball, a co-founder of Ambition House, which was set up at the Canterbury Academy campus two years ago with the aim of fast-tracking 16 to 24-year-olds into setting up their own digital businesses, said: 'What's great about UKIK is that it has been created by young people to encourage others of their age to start talking about politics. 'It's irreverent and a game based upon the British tradition of political satire that pokes fun at a high profile figure and should not be taken too seriously as it is entertainment.' A Ukip parliamentary candidate  has claimed a 'homosexual donkey' tried to rape his horse. John Rees-Evans, who is running for Cardiff South and Penarth in May's general election, told the story to protesters outside a new campaign office in Merthyr Tydfil. An anti-Ukip demonstrator had asked him about controversial remarks by fellow party members - including on from Dr Julia Gasper in Oxford, who allegedly claimed that 'some homosexuals prefer sex with animals' Mr Rees-Evans replied: 'Actually, I've witnessed that. I've got a horse and it was there in the field. And a donkey came up…which was male, and I'm afraid tried to rape my horse.' The horse bit the 'homosexual donkey' in defence, the former soldier said. He added: 'I don't think that's what she meant but it's a coincidence.'","UKIP leader said game was 'risible and pathetic' and 'crosses the line'

One marine scientist has highlighted the incredible diversity and beauty of the group of marine organisms, which to the untrained eye can look like miniature aliens. Crab megalopa larva is pictured. The creature will one day grow into a tiny crab, if it is not eaten by a larger marine animal . His book, 'Ocean Drifters: A Secret World Beneath the Waves', puts plankton under the microscope, so people can appreciate their varied and usual features, from the bulbous eyes and hairy legs of larger zooplankton to the strange geometric shapes of smaller phytoplankton, which can be a type of algae. The organisms include drifting animals, microorganisms, algae and bacteria that live in the sea, or fresh water. The microscopic algae and the tiny animals that eat them float freely in the sunlit surface of the sea, where they underpin the marine food chain, provide the world with oxygen and play an essential role in the global carbon cycle. Dr Richard Kirby has dedicated his career to studying and photographing plankton, which live in huge numbers below the ocean waves. From left to right, a paddle worm, spider crab larva and Maja Sqinado, which is a type of plankton are pictured using a microscope . The book includes high-magnification photographs as well as explaining how the creatures are being affected by global warming, which could have wide-ranging ramifications for the ecology of the planet, if plankton drop in numbers.

The book includes high-magnification photographs and explains how the creatures are being affected by global warming, which could have wide-ranging ramifications for the ecology of the planet, if plankton drop in numbers. The organisms cannot swim against the current and are at the very beginning of the marine food chain and are eaten by fish which in turn are consumed by other sea creatures like seabirds, sharks, dolphins, turtles and seals. ‘Without the plankton there would be no fish in the sea, or creatures that feed upon them,’ said Dr Kirby, a senior lecturer at Plymouth University in Devon.

'Without the plankton there would be no fish in the sea, or creatures that feed upon them,' said Dr Kirby, a senior lecturer at Plymouth University in Devon. Despite its exotic-looking strands, this microscopic animal is actually worm larva . Many people might think of plankton as simply a source of food for larger animals, but these photos highlight their complex features, including bulbous eyes and jaws. The 'mini monster' on the left is the planktonic larva of the nut crab Ebalia, a small, roughly diamond-shaped crab with a rough shell, which at its largest, reaches 12 millimetres long. On the right, another type of swimming crab larva, which has a scary-looking spike on its 'back' is pictured . ‘Not only is the plankton a good place for the young of creatures that live on the seabed to feed and grow, but the currents at the surface also help disperse them to new places, very much like the wind disperses the seeds of plants on land. ‘Increasing global temperatures are raising sea surface temperatures, thereby altering the plankton's habitat and bringing about changes in their abundance, their distributions and their seasonality. ‘If you have ever swallowed some seawater while swimming you will almost certainly have engulfed some plankton too, just like a baleen whale.’ Dr Richard Kirby (pictured) said: 'If you've ever swallowed seawater while swimming you will almost certainly have engulfed some plankton too, just like a baleen whale.'

Pictured right is the zoea larva of crabs, a type of plankton which have been magnified 150 times . Larger zooplankton, which include tiny crustaceans and other animals eat phytoplankton - algae that live near the water's surface - provide carbon to the food web, either by breathing or by dying. A Phyllosoma larva of a Spiny lobster is pictured, complete with its incredible eyes . As well as providing larger marine animals with food, plankton ecosystems play a role in regulating the ocean’s carbon cycle. Larger zooplankton include tiny crustaceans and other animals that eat phytoplankton – algae that live near the water’s surface – to provide carbon to the food web, either by breathing or by dying as their bodies decompose. Because organic material is denser than seawater, carbon sinks deep into the ocean in a process known as the biological pump, which is one reason why the oceans are considered to be the largest carbon sink on Earth.

"Posing with the British ambassador, Ukrainian student Pavlo Lapshyn receives a prize which would send him to England to work at a top technology firm. Three months after arriving, the 25-year-old was yesterday charged with killing a Muslim grandfather and was being questioned on suspicion of bombing three mosques. As his university professor father spoke of the family’s shock at hearing the allegations, pictures emerged of Lapshyn a year ago. Awarded: Ambassador Leigh Turner (left) and Michail Chubenko give Pavio Lapshyn (circled) a prize that sent him to work at an English technology firm . In a ceremony at the official  Kiev residence of then ambassador Leigh Turner, Lapshyn was  presented with third prize for his work as a PhD student at the National Metallurgical Academy of Ukraine. Stabbed in the back: Mohammed Saleem, 75 . Dressed in a suit and pink tie, the student showed little emotion as he posed for a photograph. Also present were university representative Michail Chubenko, his tutor Viktor Laskin and Delcam director Hugh Humphreys OBE. Lapshyn was offered the chance to work for Delcam in Birmingham, which started in April. There he met Denis Negreba, 22, another Ukrainian student, who was also arrested for terror offences before being released without charge on Sunday night. Negreba is now expected to act as a witness in any prosecution faced by his friend, known as Pasha. Speaking from his home town Dnipropetrovsk, 250 miles south of Ukraine’s capital, Lapshyn’s father said: ‘My son went for an internship as a programmer and at the same time he needed to work in mechanical engineering in Britain. I am in shock and I hope it is a mistake.’ His mother Galina, who almost died in a recent car accident, said: ‘I have a very good son, he has two honours degrees.’ His tutor, Mr Laskin, added: ‘He is shy and a quiet guy. He didn’t have any conflicts. He couldn’t defend himself. It is b*******.’ Grandfather Mohammed Saleem, 75, was stabbed three times and stamped on as he returned from evening prayers three months ago. Three mosques across the West Midlands have also been bombed in the past few weeks. Investigation: A police forensic tent stands at the scene of Mr Saleem's murder in Small Heath, Birmingham . 'Anxiety and distress in the local area': Officers patrol the neighbourhood where Mr Saleem was killed . The two Ukrainian students were . initially held last week by detectives investigating the explosions . before Lapshyn was also arrested in relation to ‘a further act of . terrorism’, on suspicion of the murder of Mr Saleem. Mr Saleem’s daughter, Shazia Khan, 45, said: ‘It was an act of terrorism because he was killed for his faith.’ His widow Said, 69, who was married to him for 50 years, said what happened to him was ‘so wrong’. A spokesman for the Foreign Office . said: ‘British ambassadors meet thousands of people every week as part . of their official duties.’ Lapshyn is due to appear at Westminster magistrates’ court this morning.

"A woman rowing 1,500 miles to raise $150,000 for a breast cancer charity has been sexually assaulted a month into her journey. Jenn Gibbons, 27, was hoping to become the first person to row the entire perimeter of Lake Michigan solo, inspiring women around the world to fight cancer with courage. On Sunday, she told the world that a man boarded her boat in Mueller Township in Schoolcraft County and assaulted her - and she's hoping that by reaching out about the ordeal, she can find her attacker and bring him to justice. Today the resilient woman started on her journey again, this time accompanied, but still determined to 'to give something back, even when people try to take things away from us.' Scroll down for video . Victim: Jenn Gibbons was sexually assaulted just two days into her attempt to become the first person to solo-row the 1,500-mile Lake Michigan perimeter . Determined: Despite the horrific ordeal, Miss Gibbons has vowed to continue her quest around Lake Michigan . Miss Gibbons founded Recovery on Water, a non-profit rowing team that trains recovering cancer patients to 'get fit and fight back.' As the coach and founder, she was hoping to row 30 miles per day on her solo trip to raise money for the worthwhile cause. She departed from Chicago on June 15 and was set to row around the shores of Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan and Indiana in her vessel, 'Liv.' She chronicled her journey on Facebook and Row4ROW.com, sharing the photographs, stories and struggles of the endeavor. Police believe her attacker may have carefully tracked her movement through her blog, waiting until she was vulnerable to strike. In the early morning hours of July 22, Miss Gibbons was staying along Lake Michigan in Mueller Township, Schoolcraft County. She said that a man broke into the cabin of her boat and raped her - identifying her by her full name. 'It was terrifying. He told me he knew where to find me,' she said. 'Fortunately I was able to get myself out of the situation and call the police, and get to safety,' Miss Gibbons said in an interview with CBS. 'There was an outhouse on the premises, and so I was able to get to the premises, or get to the outhouse, and go in there, and lock myself in there.' Attacker: The suspect is described as a white male in his 30s, approximately 5¿8¿ to 6¿ tall, with a fair amount of facial stubble hair . Getaway: A yellow Jeep Wrangler with a smiley face cover over the spare tyre was seen in the area at the time of the attack and is being sought by police . The man got away, but police believe he 'traveled a significant distance to commit the assault.' Miss Gibbons was able to provide a detailed description of her attacker as well as a curious vehicle she remembers seeing from the night. He is described as a white man in his thirties, between 5ft . 8ins and 6ft tall, with a moderate amount of facial stubble, short hair . and light eyes. He was wearing a grey/green T-shirt, jean shorts and . tennis shoes. Police have released a sketch of the man and are openly calling for tips about his identity or location. She also said a yellow Jeep Wrangler with a smiley . face cover over the spare tyre was seen in the area at the time of the . attack and is being sought by police. Charity-minded: Miss Gibbons is rowing to raise $150,000 for a breast cancer centre . Police believe Miss Gibbon's attacker may have pinpointed her location by following her adventures on her Internet blog . 'I have always tried to be . transparent and honest about the obstacles of this trip in the hope that . my openness and vulnerability might give someone strength or . inspiration in their fight against cancer, or in pursuing a dream,' Miss . Gibbons shared on her website. 'I . know that I had a choice in telling people about the details of my . attack, particularly that it was a sexual assault.' 'I still believe that life offers us . the privilege, the opportunity, and the responsibility, to give . something back, even when people try to take things away from us.' Jenn Gibbons . 'To go through this at . all, let alone publicly, is extremely difficult.' 'I chose to talk about . it in the hope that someone might be able to provide more information . about the person who did this to me.' Despite the horrific ordeal, Miss Gibbons has vowed to continue on her quest and has been inspired by the outpouring of support. 'I still believe that life is a gift, even when it’s scary and unfair,' she said. 'I still believe that life offers us the privilege, the opportunity, and the responsibility, to give something back, even when people try to take things away from us.' Giver: Miss Gibbons founded Recovery on Water, a non-profit rowing team that trains recovering cancer patients to 'get fit and fight back' Journey: As the coach and founder, she was hoping to row 30 miles per day on her solo trip to raise money for the worthwhile cause . She hit the road today, choosing to travel by bicycle instead of boat to ensure her safety. She will be accompanied at all times by a team of volunteers. Police officers from all over have chosen to stay by her side as well. She . wrote on her blog: 'Regarding the trip, one thing hasn’t changed - I've . still got this. But the trip plan will change in a few ways to ensure . my safety.' Hitting the Road: 'When I took this picture and smiled I realized it was the first time I'd really smiled in days. It felt great,' she said today . At Muskegon, she will reboard her boat and continue the journey by both land and water. 'My chin is up, my eyes are open, and we’re going to get this show back on the road (then water),' she said. She told the MailOnline that so far, even though it's been rainy, being back on the road has raised her spirits. She has a little less than a month until the end of her journey. 'It feels good to be making progress,' she said. 'Being able to focus on something I can control is really helpful. I can control how hard I work, how many miles I'm making;  what's going on in my body.' Miss Gibbons said that she never imaged her philosophy on using exercise as a form of recovery could also apply to sexual assault victims, but the workout has provided her with clarity and peace of mind.","Jenn Gibbons, 27, was hoping to become the first person to row the entire perimeter of Lake Michigan solo .

"Video games have been blamed for everything from encouraging violent behaviour to making us more antisocial. And now, one expert has claimed that ultra-realistic games played using virtual reality headsets could kill people. Denny Unger believes that the technology is so immersive that the first incidence of someone being scared to death, is not far away. Scroll down for video . Denny Unger believes that virtual reality technology - including Oculus Rift (pictured) is so immersive that the first incidence of someone being scared to death by playing a video game, is not far away . Virtual reality headsets, such as Oculus Rift, allow gamers to use a pair of hi-tech ‘goggles’ with a screen instead of glass to play video games. While they are currently only available for developers, commercial virtual reality headsets are expected to launch next year. A set of lenses on the screen focuses and reshapes an image for each eye, which creates a 3D image. This image matches a wearer’s movements and makes it seem as if they have stepped into the realistic world they are seeing in front of them - with 360° views. Oculus, which has now been acquired by Facebook, has been fine tuning its technology for years and a commercial version of its headset is tipped to launch next year . Oculus rift (pictured) – newly acquired by Facebook – has been fine tuning its technology for years and a commercial version of its headset is tipped to launch this year . Oculus VR was founded by 21-year-old college dropout Palmer Luckey. It is designed to provide users with an immersive virtual reality experience not only for conventional video games, but for other activities as well. Facebook purchased the company earlier this year when their $2bn (£1.2bn) deal to buy VR headset firm Oculus was approved. It will first be used for immersive games, but Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg promised the headset will 'change the way we work, play and communicate' - although virtual worlds could include advertising admitted Zuckerberg. A commercial version is rumoured to launch in 2015. The purchase of Oculus put Facebook in a battle with Sony, who has already unveiled its own version of a VR headset, destined for the PS4 next year. Mr Unger, creative director at Cloudhead Games warned a virtual reality panel in Seattle that ‘we’re very close to having the first death in VR’,Gizmodo reported. He said: ‘When the commercial version comes out, somebody is going to scare somebody to death - somebody with a heart condition or something like that. It is going to happen. Absolutely.’ Many realistic video games played on standard consoles make players feel tense and villains often jump out and 'attack' gamers. But this effect could be intensified hugely when virtual reality headsets become widely available. Mr Unger said that video game designers will have to consider the well-being of the player when designing scenarios that could be played using virtual reality headsets, to avoid some people being so scared it puts their health in jeopardy. He said that such designers need to understand how immersive the experience can be by testing their games with virtual reality headsets. ‘You really could kill somebody. You really could. We all have to be mindful of that,’ he said. This summer, developers got their hands on the next-generation Oculus Rift and one firm created a virtual girlfriend (pictured) which together with a leg-shaped lap cushion, enables lonely men to feel and sit with her . This summer, developers got their hands on the next-generation Oculus Rift. A teardown revealed upgrades to the tracking technology and sensors. Repair experts iFixit discovered the screen of the Oculus Rift Developers Kit 2 (DK2) is taken from the Samsung Galaxy Note 3. The device's 5.7-inch screen is a super Amoled touchscreen with 1080 x 1920 pixels. This gives it a pixel-per-inch density of 368, and is full HD. By comparison, Apple’s iPhone 5S has 326 PPI, and the HTC One M8 has 441. It has a 360° orientation tracking unit and external infrared camera. Positional tracking is important in virtual reality because it tracks the position of the wearer’s head in 3D, relative to the sensor. ‘When you lean in to examine a virtual object, the environment zooms in to translate your movement, adding another layer of interactivity and realism,’ iFixit said. The Oculus Rift developer kits are available from the Oculus VR website for $350 (£207). As well as providing video gamers with virtual reality experience, the headset is created for other activities too. For example, a bizarre pillow shaped like a pair of girls legs coupled with an Oculus Rift virtual reality headset is now offering hope to men who do not want to spend the evenings alone sitting on the sofa. Japanese development firm Up Frontier came up with idea to create the virtual girlfriend, who offers men the chance to sit next to her. The virtual partner is based on the Unity-chan cartoon character, which is the mascot for an open-source cross-platform game engine called Unity designed by Unity Technologies Japan. Together with a ‘lap pillow’, which mimics the shape of the character’s legs, users can rest their head on ‘her’ legs both in the virtual world and real-life - sort of. The lap pillow is known as the Hizamakura and is designed to look and feel like a kneeling pair of female legs.","Virtual reality headsets are expected to become widely available next year .

"While trying to enjoy a romantic dinner date, Clive Merrifield and his companion had spent half an hour disturbed by a crying baby at the next table. The company director suggested to the child’s parents that given it was after 10pm, the seven-month-old might be tired. The baby’s father’s reaction was to pull a bottle of wine from Mr Merrifield’s ice bucket and smash it over his head. Billy West (left) with torn shirt pictured shortly after his arrest. He has been jailed for two years and five months for the bottle attack on Clive Merrifield (right), who was left with a four-inch gash on his scalp . Mr Merrifield, 44, who was having a meal at an Indian restaurant in Islington, North London with his girlfriend was left with a deep four-inch gash on his scalp which required 16 stitches and has left him scarred. The baby’s father, Billy West, was jailed for two years and five months at Blackfriars Crown Court for what the judge called a ‘vicious and cowardly’ attack. West, 20, who arrived at the  restaurant with his partner, their baby and another man, took offence at Mr Merrifield’s comments, the court heard, and asked him to settle the matter ‘outside’. To the surprise of other diners, the . child’s mother held the infant up and sneered sarcastically: ‘It’s a . baby’. The family were escorted out of the Parveen Tandoori by staff but . West returned alone five minutes later to attack Mr Merrifield. The brutal assault occurred at Parveen, an Indian restaurant in Theberton Street, Islington, north London . Yesterday the former police constable, who runs his own auditing . business, said: ‘The child had been crying and crying at the next table, . it was constant. The mother kept getting up to hold it up to the mirror . behind us, but it wouldn’t stop. ‘It was very loud – other people noticed but they didn’t say anything, . and after about half an hour I just said to my girlfriend: “I’ve had . enough”. 'I went over and said very politely that I was sorry but this is . a quiet restaurant and we’re trying to enjoy our meal and your baby . won’t stop crying. I asked if they could take it outside for a bit, and . said it might be tired at this time of night. ‘She just held it up and started shaking it and saying “It’s a baby”. They asked me if I had a problem with children, which I don’t, and the . two men told me we could “sort this out outside”. ‘The staff asked them to leave and we carried on eating. The next thing I . knew I had been whacked on the back of the head. He had hit me with my . bottle of wine. ‘I just remember seeing my girlfriend’s face, looking really worried, . and the blood and glass on her top. I got up but he had gone, and I . looked down and saw my shirt soaked in blood.’ West was arrested six weeks after the attack  in November last year after police found him hiding in a neighbour’s home. Clive Merrifield's injury required 16 stitches and has left him scarred . Tom Wainwright, defending West, said the carpenter had ‘just snapped’ and had written a letter of apology to his victim. Passing sentence, Judge Nicholas Riddell said: ‘This was a vicious and cowardly attack.’ The victim was taken to hospital where he was given an emergency X-ray and 16 stitches. His . attacker was eventually arrested on November 17, after being found . hiding under a heap of clothes, behind a mirror, in a neighbour’s . bedroom. In an impact statement the victim said: ‘I have been left with a four inch ragged scar on the top of my head. ‘It makes me feel self-conscious in public and at work. ‘I feel it has changed people’s . opinion of me and I am concerned I am seen as a thuggish manager rather . than an authoritative manager. ‘I am self-employed and this affects me when taking out prospective clients. ‘Since leaving the Army I have tried to avoid violent situations or confrontations and this incident has taken me back to those times, and destroyed the coping mechanisms I have spent years developing.’ The court heard West has previous convictions for assault, after spraying someone with CS gas, and was on a suspended sentence for aggravated vehicle taking when he attacked Mr Merrifield. Tom Wainwright, defending West, argued the carpenter had a more productive side to his personality. ‘He was working hard at the time and he had a young child, who had been crying and not been sleeping, and he was extremely tired and stressed,’ said the barrister. ‘He does not seek to excuse his behaviour but highlights this simply to provide some background. ‘He just snapped. This was the last straw. ‘He is genuinely remorseful for his behaviour and has written a letter of apology to the victim.’ The court heard he has helped out at a local youth club and is keen to rejoin his partner and child. He has already served 218 days on remand awaiting sentence and Mr Wainwright added: ‘Not much more of a reminder is required.’ Passing sentence Judge Nicholas Riddell said: ‘You caused this unfortunate man a serious head wound which has left him with serious permanent scarring and lasting psychological effects. ‘Your counsel has rightly said there is another side to you. ‘Nonetheless this remains an offence that is so serious that only an immediate custodial sentence can be justified.’ West, of Islington, north London, admitted unlawful wounding and breaching a suspended sentence order.","Billy West was jailed for two years and five months .

'These mice were infected with exactly the same dose by . exactly the same route by the same investigator. 'The only thing . that was different was the genetic background,' he said.

"Joe Duffy, pictured, was reading the eulogy when everyone was told to 'fasten their seat belts' It could have been mistaken as a sign from the heavens above. But the mysterious voice heard through speakers during a funeral service was in fact a stewardess on a passing plane telling passengers to prepare for landing. Friends and family of Brendan Duffy had gathered at St Edward's Church in Windsor, Berkshire, to pay their final respects after the Dublin-born grandfather-of-four died on August 8, aged 78. But as his nephew Joe Duffy was reading the eulogy, everyone was suddenly told to 'fasten their seat belts' and 'prepare doors for landing'. It is believed the gaffe happened because the church's wireless microphone and the plane's radio were on the same frequency. Luckily mourners saw the funny side and burst out laughing during the service much to the priest's embarrassment. Joe, 57, a RTE radio presenter, told The Sun: 'Everyone was looking around and up to heaven, trying to figure out where the voice was coming from.' 'Everybody saw the funny side - it was a real talking point.' According to Father Michael Morrissey, the priest who led the service, it is not the first time this has happened. Over and out: Friends and family of Brendan Duffy had gathered at St Edward's Church in Windsor, Berkshire . The church happens to be directly under the flight path into Heathrow Airport.

"Manchester City's plans for next season's Champions League campaign have received a huge boost after it was confirmed the club will only need to name five rather than eight home-grown players in their reduced 21-man squad. Pressure from the players' union FIFPro has forced UEFA to agree to water down its sanctions imposed against City and Paris St Germain for breaching financial fair play rules. UEFA had intended that both clubs would only be allowed to have 21 players with eight of those having come through the youth system in their home countries. Champions: The Premier League winners were penalised by UEFA for breaching Financial Fair Play . Restrictions: City only need five home-grown players in their squad so can have more foreign players . Ease: UEFA's annoucement makes manager Manuel Pellegrini's transfer plans some what easier now . UEFA's general secretary Gianni Infantino has now confirmed that instead the clubs will only have to name five home-grown players, a decision which could have a significant impact on City's transfer plans. Last season, City registered 23 players and used only 21 due to the eight home-grown players rule, so to have this reduced to five means the effect of the sanction on the club has been greatly diluted. Infantino, in Sao Paulo for the FIFA Congress, told Press Association Sport: 'It came after a request from the players union FIFPro saying when you take these kind of sanctions and measures you cannot harm the players and the rights of a player who has a contract for the behaviour of the clubs. 'So we looked at it and it was felt appropriate there for the number to be proportionally reduced as well.' Manchester City and PSG were each fined £49million over three years, which could be reduced to a single year if financial targets are met in the following years. City said their summer transfer plans would be unaffected by a restriction limit of their transfer spending to a net £49million. Positive: City have been boosted by the news they will only have to field five home-grown players . Home-grown: James Milner (left) has been linked with a move away and Joleon Lescott (right) has already left . The clubs also have to cap their Champions League squad wage bills at their 2013/4 levels for the next two seasons. The reduction in the home-grown players limit means City will be able to cope with the expected departure of Joleon Lescott on a free transfer, with Micah Richards and James Milner also being linked with a move. Keeper Joe Hart, midfielder Jack Rodwell, left-back Gael Clichy and defender Dedryck Boyata were also named as home-grown players in last season's Champions League squad.","UEFA agree to water down its sanctions imposed on City and PSG .

"A craze for exotic pet newts has spread a deadly infection from Asia to Europe that could threaten to wipe out native amphibian species unless action is taken, scientists have warned. One of the creatures most at risk from the fungal disease is the great crested newt, already an endangered and protected species in the UK. The skin-eating fungus, Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans, is believed to have originated in south-east Asia, where indigenous newts and salamanders are immune to its effects. One of the types found to be most at risk is the great crested newt (pictured), which is already endangered . But it is lethal to European and American species, which have evolved no resistance to the disease. Last year researchers learned the fungus was responsible for a mystery outbreak in the Netherlands that killed off 96 per cent of the country's fire salamanders. Experts now fear an expanding epidemic that has parallels with the human Ebola crisis. As with Ebola, the salamander fungus is transmitted by direct contact, and there is a danger of it being exported globally on international flights. Experts fear an epidemic similar to the human ebola crisis, as the infection is spread by direct contact . In this case, it is the pet trade that may have to face controls to prevent the infection spreading, say the authors of a new study assessing the threat. Asian salamanders and newts that could be harbouring the fungus are traded in large numbers around the world. Between 2001 and 2009, more than 2.3 million Chinese fire belly newts were imported into the US alone. Researchers from Imperial College London, who have already identified two cases in Europe, want tighter controls on pet imports to be introduced urgently.","Craze for pet newts led to fears it could destroy native species .

"A flight from Ho Chi Minh City to Sydney descended into chaos when an agitated passenger attempted to jump out of the emergency exit. The Vietnam Airlines flight from Vietnam to Australia had been airborne for around two hours when passengers reported hearing panicked screaming. New Zealander Mark Ansley claims he and a group of fellow fliers were forced to physically restrain the man, who had begun to kick the emergency exit, attempting to jump out of the plane. Scroll down for video . Passenger Mark Ansley took a photograph of the man who was restrained on board the flight . Passengers on the Vietnam Airlines flight became anxious when a man kicked the emergency exit (file photo) 'This p***k tried to kill himself and all others onboard VN773 by jumping out emergency exit,' he said on his Facebook page. The man, who had become agitated, was claiming he had been kidnapped and drugged, and that there were people in Sydney waiting to kill him. Mr Ansley told New Zealand broadcaster TVNZ: 'I was having quite a good sleep and I just heard screaming, really loud panicked screaming. 'I sat bolt upright and looked down towards the first bulkhead where the first exit row is and there was a guy at the exit door trying to kick it open. It's impossible to open the emergency exit door during flight due to the difference in air pressure inside and outside the aircraft . 'A cable tie was handed to me and I couldn't get it around his hands because he was fighting too much, so that's why I decided to stun him or knock him out, which didn't work. 'But eventually I did stun him enough to stop him struggling. It was very scary, I was really shaken. It's fight or flight isn't it, and I tend to flight.' Mr Ansley, who was flying home to his six-year-old son, said he and the other passengers tied the man to some seats, and tried to find out if was travelling with anyone. He believed the passenger was in some sort of drug-induced state. Passengers did not know that it is impossible to open the emergency exit door in flight due to the high altitude. As the plane climbs, the pressure outside the cabin decreases relative to that inside the cabin, and this difference in pressure keeps the door sealed. The Australian Federal Police confirmed they were alerted after a 27-year-old man from the Sydney was restrained by airline staff and passengers after he allegedly tried to open an exit door on a flight from Ho Chi Minh City to Sydney. The man had an initial medical assessment at St George Hospital and was then issued a notice to appear in court for the offence of endangering the safety of an aircraft. He is due to appear at Downing Centre Court on December 16, according to an AFP spokesman.

"The Thai government has labelled 65 provinces as disaster zones as residents struggle to cope with winter temperatures of 15C (59F). In the North of the country a cold snap has seen the mercury drop as low as 1C (34F) in rural areas, with towns and city shivering in temperatures of 14C. The Government is now handing out free warm clothing and winter blankets to chilly residents, and any province which has more than three consecutive days of sub 15C temperatures can apply for emergency funding.

In the northern Nakhon Phanom province, governor Adisak Thep-art said 10 out of 12 districts have been declared disaster zones with some 100,000 people suffering. So far, 20,000 residents have received winter aid. Maha Sarakham province in the northeast has also been swept by the cold spell, brought about by an area of high pressure drifting across from China, with up to 200,000 Maha Sarakham residents in danger.

"Christina Reber, 45, from Indiana allegedly marched into her ex's house and squeezed his genitals 'as hard as she could' A mother who tore the scrotum of her former 'on-off boyfriend’ during a row at his home is now claiming she did so in self-defense. Christina Lorina Reber, 45, from Marion, Indiana, was arrested in 2012 after she allegedly marched into her ex’s home, grabbed hold of his genitals and squeezed ‘as hard as she could’. She is due to stand trial on March 12 at Delaware Circuit Court on a charge of aggravated battery. She faces ten years in prison if found guilty. The victim, 57, was left with a deep tear to his scrotum following the attack in Muncie, Indiana and was treated at nearby Ball Memorial Hospital. The 57-year-old said that Reber attacked him while drunk because he had ended their eight-month relationship. The police report said: '(The victim) stated that after he grabbed Reber, he felt her grab . his scrotum and begin squeezing as hard as she could. '(He) stated that he was in incredible pain when Reber grabbed his scrotum and began digging in her fingers. '(He) stated that Reber refused to let go of his scrotum and that both of them fell to the ground.' The report noted that the victim was covered in blood - and part of his scrotum had been completely torn from his body. According to the police report, Reber . walked into the victim’s property unannounced and yelled at him to ‘call . the f****** police’ before she attacked him. Last week, Reber's defense attorney Zaki Ali filed a self-defense notice before the trial begins, according to indystar.com. At a recent pre-trial ruling, Judge Marianne Vorhees said Reber would not be able to put an 'expert witness' on the stand to put forward a theory that because her 57-year-old victim was wearing an unspecified 'personal device' he was more likely to be injured. She is currently out on bail after she provided a $10,000 bond.

"Hippos are not usually known for their subtlety but this hulking beast appears to be using stealth techniques while he sets his sights on his prey. The large mammal submerged itself before seemingly gliding gracefully head first out of the water. For a moment, its large head appeared camouflaged in the brown water and even looked more like a stalking crocodile than a cumbersome hippo. Making a wake: The hippo glides through the water, its head just above the surface, as a small wake forms on either side of it at the Chobe National Park in Botswana . Coming up: The surface of the water begins to bubble-up as the hippo spots a boat full of tourists and decides to take a closer look . In the event, its 'prey' was a nearby boat full of sight-seers which quickly made off when the skipper finally spotted the creature from the deep. Tourist Deena Sveinsson, a commercial airline pilot, had her camera at hand and managed to capture the moment which happened on the Chobe River in the Chobe National Park in Botswana. Deena, from Colorado, said there was about 30 hippos around in the water about 7am and all but one were busy either playing with each other or sleeping. Ms Sveinsson said: 'Although we were not very close this particular hippo felt we were and began chasing our boat. Eerily close: The hippo's ears can be seen just above the water line as it proceeds towards the boat while about 30 other hippos amuse themselves nearby . Breaking mad: The hippo appears out of the water, but not before the tourist boat driver guided his vessel and his passengers well out of harms way . 'Sensing this our driver drove the boat away as fast as he could as death by hippo is the number one cause of death in the African Wild. 'Nobody else on the boat caught on that we were being chased and I happened to turn around quickly to see it and snapped these photos.' When she looked over the pictures Ms Sveinsson said she was surprised at how graceful the hippo looked. She said: 'I realised that the one of him looking very graceful in the water was very special as it showed hippos in a different way, one that was not yawning or spitting.'","As about 30 hippos played with each other and enjoyed a quiet morning snooze on the Chobe River in Botswana .

It reported that three Merlin helicopters had already been flying experts from the ship into the country as the ship approached the shoreline. The trucks on the ship will be used to transport staff, medicines and equipment around Sierra Leone. The ship has made the journey from a British naval base in Gibraltar, where it was loaded with its much-needed cargo earlier last week.

'Now that RFA Argus has arrived in country we are all looking forward to playing our part and doing our best to contribute to the DFID-led mission to contain the spread of the disease.' Aircraft handler Mark Chapman, 33, said: 'Just a few weeks ago we were conducting exercises off the UK coast, so this is a complete change of programme and a step up in tempo, but this is what all the training is for. 'I joined the Navy to go on operations around the world, but it's not all about war-fighting, there is the humanitarian element too. I am proud to be in Sierra Leone where I think we will add real value.' Once she arrives, she is likely to spend up to six months there. In total, around 800 British military personnel are being deployed to help with the establishment of Ebola treatment centres and an Ebola training academy. It comes as a scientist who helped to discover the Ebola virus revealed that he is concerned that the disease could spread to China given the large numbers of Chinese workers traveling to and from Africa. Peter Piot, who is director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said on Thursday it's not 'rocket science' that with many exchanges between the two regions the disease could spread. 'The concern I have is that I don't think you can really stop people from traveling. These patients will show up in any country in the world, but China is quite vulnerable,' Piot said. 'The issue is: 'What is the quality, the standard of infection control?' In public hospitals in China, the ones that I've visited, the level of infection control is very poor,' he said.

But Piot said China's controls for infectious diseases have improved and authorities have become more open about public health risks since severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, broke out in southern China in 2002. SARS infected about 8,000 people worldwide, killing nearly 800. Conversely, Japan has disease controls and hygiene that are up to international standards, but it needs to do more to help combat what has become not just an epidemic but a humanitarian crisis, said Piot, a board member of the Global Health Innovative Technology fund, a collaboration funded by the Japanese government, Japanese pharmaceutical companies and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The fund supports research into treatments for malaria, tuberculosis, dengue and other so-called neglected tropical diseases. Piot said that despite the urgency of the crisis, it was crucial that funds going to those efforts not be diverted to work on Ebola. Treating the Ebola outbreaks as a humanitarian crisis would help overcome worries over budgetary issues, he said. His comments came as the World Health Organization declared that Liberia, the countryworst-hit by an Ebola epidemic, may be seeing a decline in the spread of the virus.

"Car parks in China have begun installing women-only zones to cater for female drivers who have trouble parking. Painted pink, decorated with designs and with larger spaces, this underground car park in Tianjin, east China has been designed purely with women in mind. It even has pink digital signs directing women to the all-female parking zone. This underground car park is beneath a building materials mall but it is one of several in a recent trend to cater for less skilled female drivers. Ladies only: It is the latest in a string of women-only zones to have emerged in car parks across China. Above, this building materials mall in Tianjin, northern China, introduced a pink women-only parking zone last year . After a shopping centre in Shijiazhuang city, Hebei province, installed a pink, women's only parking zone, the mall official said it was to cater to women's 'strong sense of colour and different sense of distance'. He also told AFP at the time the Wanxiang-Tiancheng shopping centre had 'installed signs and security monitoring equipment that corresponded more to women's needs'. The LP - Ladies' Parking - zones appear to be a growing trend in China where the middle class is bulging and more people have the income necessary to buy and drive vehicles. Ladies parking areas appear to be a growing trend in China where the middle class is bulging and more people have access to cars . However, the policy appears to be at odds with statistics on driving fatalities. A study titled 'Basic Characteristics of Road Traffic Deaths in China' published in January, revealed there were more than 67,000 people killed in road traffic crashes, including parking incidents, in 2009. One of the significant risk factors was gender. But contrary to the apparent belief of the shopping mall planners, men have a far higher risk of crashing then women. In the study, fatal crashes by male drivers were more than three times than that of female drivers. The women's parking zones have larger spaces, ideal for the trend in larger vehicles . And regardless of the province, road traffic mortality rates were higher in men than in women, irrespective of income level and age. While some women struggle to park vehicles, it would appear from the data that some men do also, although the study does not account for scratches and prangs while parking. Lower car insurance quotes for women than men also suggests that women are safer drivers, regardless of reputation. Coupled with a trend towards larger vehicles, more people driving and high fatality rates, perhaps all car parks should have larger spaces. Despite the reputation, women drivers in China are three times less likely to be killed when driving than men . The pink parking area is under a building materials store in Tianjin, east China .","Pink Ladies' Parking zones are decorated with pictures and have more room .

"The American executive who is still being held hostage at his company's factory outside of Beijing was trying to make light of the situation and keep his spirits high when he was interviewed on American television this morning. 'I got shaved today, I was given an electric razor so I'm feeling pretty good today,' Chip Starnes said from behind the caged windows of the Chinese factory. 'I decided I'm going to stick with the blue shirt all the way through, sort of like my little slogan thing.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . On lockdown: Chip Starnes has been held hostage in his factory outside of Beijing for the past five days . Getting his message out: He has been able to speak to several news outlets during the capture but has not been allowed off the grounds for fear that the workers will not be paid . Starnes, 42, has been held hostage for five days now as workers demanding severance packages like those given to 30 co-workers in a phased-out department. Mr Starnes, a co-owner of Coral Springs, Florida-based Specialty Medical Supplies, said local officials had visited the 10-year-old plant on the capital's outskirts and coerced him into signing agreements Saturday to meet the workers' demands even though he sought to make clear that the remaining 100 workers weren't being laid off. He told The Today Show that he has tried to leave the plant but it his escape attempts have not worked. He said that the conditions of his . captivity have been reasonable, with McDonalds and KFC getting delivered . to him for breakfast and Chinese food with rice for lunch. The . local police authorities have been alerted and are on site, but he said . that is more to insure that he receives sufficient food and they have . little interest in ending the dispute. Missed: Starnes' wife said that they have spoken every day since he has been in captivity but that is not enough . 'They're hands off here- they let the workers handle it themselves,' he said of the local authorities. 'I did try and actually go over the gate but they would not let me go,' he said. His wife told NBC that while they have been in contact, that is not enough for their family. 'I just want him home, his kids want him home. Every day we do get to talk to him but it's very upsetting,' she said. The workers were expecting wire . transfers by Tuesday, he said, adding that about 80 of them had been . blocking every exit around the clock and depriving him of sleep by . shining bright lights and banging on windows of his office. He declined to clarify the amount, saying he wanted to keep it confidential. 'I feel like a trapped animal,' Mr Starnes told The Associated Press on Monday from his first-floor office window, while holding onto the window's bars. 'I think it's inhumane what is going on right now. I have been in this area for 10 years and created a lot of jobs and I would never have thought in my wildest imagination something like this would happen.' Anguish: 'I feel like a trapped animal,' Mr Starnes said from his first-floor office window, while holding onto the window's bars . Workers inside the compound, a pair of two-story buildings behind gates and hedges in the Huairou district of the northeastern Beijing suburbs, repeatedly declined requests for comment, saying they did not want to talk to foreign media. It is not rare in China for managers to be held by workers demanding back pay or other benefits, often from their Chinese owners, though occasionally also involving foreign bosses. The labor action reflects growing uneasiness among workers about their jobs amid China's slowing economic growth and the sense that growing labor costs make the country less attractive for some foreign-owned factories. The account about local officials coercing Starnes to meet workers' demands - if true - reflects how officials typically consider stifling unrest to be a priority. Huairou district and Qiaozi township governments declined to comment. A local police spokesman said police were at the scene to maintain order. Four uniformed police and about a dozen other men who declined to identify themselves were standing across the road from the plant. Demands: Mr Starnes said that dozens of workers demanding severance packages like those given to co-workers in a phased-out department . Captive: An unidentified U.S. Embassy employee, left, and Chinese official walk outside the closed gate at Specialty Medical Supplies plant where Chip Starnes is being held hostage . 'As far as I know, there was a labor dispute between the workers and the company management and the dispute is being solved,' said spokesman Zhao Lu of the Huairou Public Security Bureau. 'I am not sure about the details of the solution, but I can guarantee the personal safety of the manager.' Representatives from the U.S. Embassy stood outside the gate much of the day, and eventually were let in. U.S. Embassy spokesman Nolan Barkhouse said the two sides were on the verge of an agreement and that Starnes would have access to his attorneys. It was unclear what agreement might be reached, and subsequent attempts to contact Starnes were not immediately successful. Starnes said the company had gradually been winding down its plastics division, planning to move it to Mumbai, India. He arrived in Beijing last Tuesday to lay off the last 30 people. Some had been working there for up to nine years, so their compensation packages were 'pretty nice,' he said. Some of the workers in the other divisions got wind of this, and, coupled with rumors that the whole plant was moving to India, started demanding similar severance packages on Friday. Christian Murck, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said he wasn't familiar with Starnes' case, but that such hostage-taking was 'not a major problem' for the foreign business community. 'It happened more often say 15 years ago than today, but it still happens from time to time,' he said. 'It rarely leads to personal harm to the managers involved, but there are cases when it has in years past.'","Chip Starnes, 42, says he is being kept captive by scores of workers .

They will be asked to save energy by halting production during the peak period for households if high demand caused by unusually harsh weather puts families at risk of being plunged into darkness. Industry watchdog Ofgem has decided the plan is necessary to ensure an adequate supply of electricity and prevent the lights going out in homes. Lights out: Industry watchdog Ofgem has decided the plan is necessary to ensure an adequate supply of electricity and prevent the lights going out in homes . But the cost of running the scheme, if it needs to be implemented, is bound to fall on the shoulders of consumers through their bills. The measures would also inevitably affect the nation’s productivity, thereby harming the economic recovery. They are needed because many coal and gas-fired power stations are being closed or mothballed to meet government promises to cut carbon emissions. At the same time, not enough wind turbines are being built to cover the resulting fall in Britain’s electricity-generating capacity. Hundreds of firms could sign up to the scheme, with the National Grid giving them a total of around £10million for agreeing to take part. The bill could double or treble if the requirement to cut energy use is triggered. The system of payments will only kick in if winters are particularly harsh and demand from households rises as a result.

Factories would cease production between 4pm and 8pm, when demand peaks as millions of children and workers return home. The Energy Intensive Users Group, which speaks for heavy industry, said there is a real risk of power shortages next winter and even more so for 2015-16. 'How are we supposed to expect investment to continue into this country if we are in danger of moving toward having Third World levels of reliability for power?' Jeremy Nicholson, Energy Intensive Users Group . Its director, Jeremy Nicholson, said: ‘These are, in effect, emergency measures to deal with the possibility of electricity shortages until new supply comes on line.’ He said that the scheme was a necessary response to the situation, but added: ‘This can’t be a sustainable way of managing the energy system. We should not be in this situation. 'Ofgem has been warning governments about the threat to supply margins for many years. But the changes to the energy market, such as the building of new nuclear power stations, is coming too late.’ Speaking of the economic impact,  he asked: ‘How are we supposed to expect investment to continue into this country if we are in danger of moving toward having Third World levels of reliability for power?’ Ofgem chief executive Andrew Wright said it was prudent to develop new measures as insurance against blackouts, adding: ‘There can be no room for industry complacency on security of supply.’","Factories and businesses will be paid to turn out lights from 4pm to 8pm .

"Four in five voters back Ed Miliband’s pledge to freeze energy bills – but half doubt Labour will be able to deliver it. The Big Six energy firms will today face MPs amid growing public anger at bills rising by up to 10 per cent this winter. David Cameron is under intense pressure to act to curb rises, with almost 70 per cent of Tories backing Mr Miliband’s policy to freeze rises for two years. Voters back Milliband's freeze . Threat: Labour leader Ed Miliband used his conference speech last month to promise to freeze energy bills for 20 months if he wins the 2015 election . Four of the Big Six firms have already announced big price rises, with ScottishPower bills going up by 9 per cent, Npower announced a 10.4 per cent price hike, British Gas a 9.2 per cent rise and Scottish & Southern Energy an 8.2 per cent increase. The firms have variously blamed rising wholesale prices, bills for upgrading gas mains and electricity cables and extra green levies imposed by the government. But official figures released by energy regulator Ofgem reveal company profits have doubled in a year, while wholesale costs have risen by just 1.7 per cent. Mr Miliband used his party conference speech last month to promise Labour would freeze energy bills for 20 months if he wins the 2015 election. It would save the average household £120 each and businesses will be £1,800 better off on their gas and electricity bills. Soaring profits: This graph shows how energy firms have seen their profits soar as bills go up. The wholesale energy cost has remained relatively stable . A new survey reveals 80 per cent of voters support the idea of freezing gas and electricity prices while reforms to the Big Six energy companies are made. Worrying for Mr Cameron, the idea is supported by 69 per cent of Tory voters. However, the ComRes/Independent poll shows voters are sceptical that Mr Miliband actually freeze bills. Only 41 per cent agree Labour would deliver on the pledge, while 52 per cent disagree. One in five Labour voters think Mr Miliband is likely to break his promise. Overall Labour has an eight-point lead in the poll, on 36 per cent ahead of the Tories on 28 per cent. The Lib Dems are on 11 per cent and UKIP 12 per cent. The Big Six energy firms are expected to get a rough ride when they face the energy select committee today. Labour’s shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint said: ‘The energy companies must come clean about why they are imposing yet another round of inflation-bust price rises this winter when they are already making huge profits. ‘The latest revelations about rising profits and the growing gap between wholesale costs and household energy bills highlight why answers are needed. ‘Britain's energy market isn't working for ordinary families and businesses.’ Pressure: Calls have grown for action on bills from David Cameron, who today met The Poppy Girls outside Number 10 ahead of the Royal British Legion's 2013 Poppy Appeal . Consumer group Which? has written to George Osborne calling for him to take action to curb costs in the autumn statement, warning that three in ten people do not know how they will afford to heat their homes this winter. ‘People need your help - and they need it now,’ it has told the Chancellor. It calls for a number of measures to be introduced to claw back cash, including separating energy generation from supply to help make the wholesale market more competitive, scrapping the carbon floor price, freezing the smart meter roll out for two years, removing the Warm Home Discount from consumers' bills and reforming the Energy Companies Obligation, which helps people insulate their homes. The plans could save consumers up to £1.8 billion per year, Which? estimates. Executive director Richard Lloyd said: ‘Consumers have been left reeling by the recent round of inflation busting price hikes. People need help to cope with the rising cost of their energy bills - and they need it now. ‘When George Osborne stands up to deliver his autumn statement we want him to stand up for the millions of hard-pressed consumers who are grappling day-to-day with rising energy costs. He must cut the Big Six companies and the cost of Government energy policies down to size.’ A Department of Energy and Climate Change spokeswoman said: ‘We welcome this contribution to the debate, and agree that stronger competition is the key to tackling energy bills.’ The . simplest, and often best, way to slash your energy bills is to use an online . service that can compare all the best tariffs on offer for you.

"French fighter jets had to accompany a hijacked Ethiopian Airlines plane into Geneva airport because the Swiss air-force only work during regular office hours, it has emerged. An Ethiopian Airlines co-pilot - named locally as Hailemedehin Abera Tagegn - hijacked the plane bound for Rome and flew it to Switzerland yesterday, after threatening to crash it. When the plane landed the 30-year-old Ethiopian escaped from the cockpit down a rope and asked to seek asylum saying he wasn't safe in his own country. However, today it was revealed that it was Italian and French pilots who were scrambled to escort the plane into land and the Swiss played no part in the mission. The Swiss pilots were alerted to the problem at 4.30am but are only operational in normal office hours - not before 8am. Scroll down for video . Escape: A rope can be seen hanging from the window of the cockpit where the pilot fled yesterday after landing in Geneva airport after being escorted by fighter jets . Distressed: A family member of Hailemedhin Abera, 31, has said the co-pilot had been upset for the past month over the death of his uncle . Reddit user OK3n has posted an account of the hijacking from inside the plane, in which he says Abera told passengers 'sit down, put your masks on, I'm cutting the oxygen' The passenger then says he was left for six hours to ponder his fate while cabin crew walked around giving out drinks and trying to keep everybody calm . He said the attendants didn't give out any information on what was happening, but could be seen crying . A Swiss airforce spokesman Laurent Savary told AFP: 'Switzerland cannot intervene because its airbases are closed at night and on the weekend. It's a question of budget and staffing.' The Boeing 767-300 aircraft with 202 . passengers and crew on board had taken off from the Ethiopian capital, . Addis Ababa, and landed in Geneva at about 6am local time with just 20 . minutes of fuel remaining. The plane circled around Geneva until the co-pilot, who had worked for the airline for five years, had no criminal record and was declared medically sane, heard a direct response about his requests for asylum, it has been reported. Geneva airport chief executive Robert . Deillon told reporters that the co-pilot, . took control of the plane when the pilot left the cockpit. According to Sky News, passengers said . the pilot repeatedly demanded the co-pilot open the cockpit door but the . hijacker refused and threatened to crash the plane if the pilot carried . on. ‘The pilot went to the toilet and he (the co-pilot) locked himself in the cockpit,’ Mr Deillon said. The man ""wanted asylum in Switzerland"",' he said. ‘That's the motivation of the hijacking.’ Precaution: Geneva Airport was temporarily closed when the hijacked plane landed . Unusual approach: A graphic from a tracking app showing how the plane circled over Geneva . An Ethiopian man smuggled a pistol onto a plane and hijacked a Lufthansa flight going from Frankfurt to Addis Ababa in 1993. He demanded it be flown to the U.S. because he was denied a visa. In June and April 1994, Ethiopian Airlines suffered two hijackings at the hands of passengers who demanded to be flown to Europe, according to the Aviation Safety Network, which tracks aviation hijackings and other incidents. In 1995, an Ethiopian man trying to avoid being sent back home used a knife from a food tray to commandeer an Olympic Airlines jet just before it landed in Athens, Greece. Police overpowered the hijacker with no injuries to any of the 114 people on board, according to AP reports. Also that year, five armed men seized an Ethiopian Airlines jetliner and demanded the plane be flown to Greece and then Sweden. It was instead diverted to Al Obeid, about 300 miles (480 kilometers) west of Khartoum, Sudan. In 1996 a flight from Ethiopia to Ivory Coast via Kenya was seized by hijackers who then demanded to be flown to Australia. That flight ran out fuel and crashed off the island nation of Comoros, killing 125 people, according to the Aviation Safety Network. In 2001, five military pilot trainees wrested control of a plane during a flight from Bahr Dar, in northwestern Ethiopia, to the capital Addis Ababa and demanded to be flown to Saudi Arabia. The plane didn't have enough fuel so it landed in neighboring Sudan, according to AP reports. In 2002 two passengers armed with small knives and an explosive device attempted to hijack a domestic flight but were shot and killed by in-flight security, the Aviation Safety Network reported. The . hijacking began over Italy, Switzerland's southern neighbour, and two . Italian fighter jets were scrambled to accompany the plane, Mr Deillon . said. The co-pilot himself . alerted authorities to the plane's hijacking, officials added - though . passengers on the plane were unaware it had been hijacked. After landing . in Geneva, the co-pilot exited the cockpit using a rope and turned . himself in to authorities. Police escorted passengers one by one, with their hands above their heads, from the taxied plane to waiting vehicles. Geneva . prosecutor Olivier Jornot said Swiss federal authorities were . investigating the hijacking and would press charges which could carry a . prison sentence of up to 20 years. Geneva airport was initially closed to other flights, but operations resumed around two hours after the hijacked plane landed. ‘We hope everything will return to normal in the afternoon,’ Mr Deillon added. The flight apparently began emitting a 'hijacking code' as it flew over Sudan and this was picked up by aviation site Airlinereporter.com. It tweeted in the early hours of Monday morning: 'Ethiopian Airlines’ Flight 702 Squawks “HiJacking” for Reasons Unknown.' It reported that this beacon, known as a '7500', cannot come from a glitch. The website said that the co-pilot kept the plane in the air over Switzerland and France until his asylum request was mentioned. Ethiopian Airlines is owned by Ethiopia's government, which has faced persistent criticism over its rights record and alleged intolerance for political dissent. Human Rights Watch says Ethiopia's human rights record 'has sharply deteriorated' over the years. The rights group says authorities severely restrict basic rights of freedom of expression, association, and assembly. The government has been accused of targeting journalists, opposition members, as well as the country's minority Muslim community.","Flight ET702 made an unscheduled landing in Geneva on Monday morning .

"Nicholas Totty, was sentenced to life in prison after pleading guilty to four rapes during a four-hour rampage through Rotherham . A drug-crazed bodybuilder armed with knives violently raped a woman in the street and a teenager three times in her own home after he smashed his way in. Former Royal Navy chef Nicholas Totty, 25, was jailed for life with a minimum term of 10 years following his four-hour rampage in the Rotherham area of South Yorkshire. A mother was forced to watch her daughter being raped three times by Totty and another woman only escaped a sex attack because her dog frightened him off. Sheffield Crown Court heard powerfully-built 18-stone Totty, who is 6ft 4 inches, was hooked on anabolic steroids and was discharged from the Navy in 2010 for using the drugs. Andrew Dallas, prosecuting, said Totty had a girlfriend but had several other affairs. The court heard he had a high sex drive and indulged in violent sexual role plays with women. His rampage began at 9.15pm on Friday, September 27 when he tried to sexually attack a 24-year-old woman as she walked her dog on a footpath alongside a main road in Rotherham. Totty cycled up in front of her and waited in the shadows until he pounced on her with his arm outstretched trying to grab her neck. He made three grabs for her but her dog intervened and jumped up, forcing him to flee. The victim recognised him as someone she knew from school. Totty then went home to check his Facebook but was out on the streets by 11.15pm where he banged on a steelworker’s door hoping to find a woman but made a story up about asking directions. A few minutes later he accosted a 27-year-old woman who was eight months pregnant in the street as she walked home from the town’s railway station. He shone a torch in her face before hitting her with it on the head and pushing her to the ground. He told her if she shouted out he would slit her throat with a chef’s knife and then forced her to twice perform a sex act. He produced some kitchen roll out of a carrier bag which he used to wipe her head wound in a bid to get rid of any evidence. Totty forced his way into the home of a mother and daughter, raping the girl three times while forcing her mother to watch. He also forced a woman who was eight months pregnant to perform a sex act on him while he threatened her with a knife. File picture . After she ran away he caught up with her and ripped off her trousers and underwear but a passing motorist heard the woman’s screams and Totty ran off, leaving a second knife on the ground. Mr Dallas said Totty then tried to get into the home of a woman with whom he had a previous sexual relationship but she slammed the door in his face. The worst attack was on a mother, 46, and her teenage daugher who were at home alone in bed at 12.45am. The mother had lost her husband only weeks before and it is thought Totty may have known he would find her and her daughter alone as he knew the teenager’s relative. Totty smashed his way into the house through the front and inside doors and as the mother dialled 999 he raced upstairs. He pushed them both onto the floor and threatened to kill them before dragging them both by their hair to the bathroom. He forced the teenager to perform a sex act before raping her three times. When her mother tried to intervene, Totty knocked her to the floor and stamped on her face and neck. Totty then suddenly changed and 'became sympathetic' when the mother spoke of her husband’s death. He ran off leaving their mobile phones in the garden. He was arrested three days later after a massive police hunt. Totty admitted four counts of rape, wounding with intent, attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent and assault with intent to cause sexual offence at Sheffield Crown Court, pictured . Totty, of Whiston, near Rotherham, who lived with his mother and stepfather, admitted four rapes, assault with intent to commit a sexual offence, wounding with intent and attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent. Dermot Hughes, defending, said: 'For the physical and emotional destruction he caused during that rampage he is truly sorry.' 'He wished to address the underlying causes of his offending inside jail and his behaviour was very much out of character. 'He is physically fit, mentally able and could have led a fulfilling and rewarding life,' he said. The judge Mr Justice Globe said of the sex attack on the 27-year-old: 'It was a horrific, life-changing experience for her and his first victim was only saved from a serious sex attack by her dog.' He said the women targeted in their home would have been dwarfed by his large frame and had now been forced to change address. 'Both were left with deep emotional and mental scars and can’t stop thinking about the events and are worried about their safety in the sanctity of their own home,' he said. 'The daughter fears she will be condemned to a lifetime of worry, fear and anxiety.' The judge said a psychiatric report showed Totty had claimed he was hearing voices and thought people were plotting against him but it was all part of him trying to take control of his life as the motive for his offending was 'all linked to your heavy and persistent use of drugs.' There was evidence he had a significant personality disorder and was of a psychopathic disposition, presenting a clear risk to the public which was why he was being given a life sentence. 'There is a clear risk of further random violent sexual crimes,' said the judge. Totty’s victims along with family members packed the public gallery and one woman applauded as he received his sentence.","Former Royal Navy chef Nicholas Totty was discharged from the Navy in 2010 after becoming addicted to anabolic steroids .

"Scientists claim that turning down the lights (illustrated) reduces emotional intensity, allowing you to keep a clear head when making difficult decisions . Some decisions are so difficult that you can mull them over from every conceivable angle and there is still no obvious answer. But if you need to make an enlightened decision, dimming the lights could help. Scientists claim that turning down the lights reduces emotional intensity, allowing you to keep a clear head when making tough choices. A new study led by the University of Toronto Scarborough has found that both positive and negative human emotions are felt more intensely in bright light. Alison Jing Xu, assistant professor of management at the university and Aparna Labroo of Northwestern University, conducted a series of studies to examine the unusual paradox of lighting and human emotion. While other studies have shown that people can be more optimistic about the stock market on sunny days, while gloomy days can result in seasonal affective disorder, Professor Xu said: ‘we found that on sunny days depression-prone people actually become more depressed’. To investigate the phenomena, the duo asked experiment participants to rate a wide range of things, such as the spiciness of chicken-wing sauce, the aggressiveness of a fictional character, how attractive someone was and the taste of two juices, under different lighting conditions. They found that emotions run higher in bright light, so that sauce tasted hotter, characters felt more aggressive and people looked more attractive, for example. The researchers found that emotions run higher in bright light. They think this might be because our emotional system perceives sunshine as heat (illustrated) which in itself triggers our emotions . Participants drank more of the delicious-tasting juice and less of the unfavourable juice too, according to the study, which was published in the Journal of Consumer Psychology. Professor Xu believes the effect bright light has on our emotional system may be the result of it being perceived as heat - and the perception of heat can trigger our emotions. ‘Bright light intensifies the initial emotional reaction we have to different kinds of stimulus including products and people,’ she said. Most small everyday decisions are made in bright light, but the researchers found that dimming the lights can help people make more rational decisions and settle negotiations more easily. The scientists said that marketers might want to investigate the lighting levels in shops as if retailers are selling emotional expressive products such as flowers (pictured) or engagement rings it would make sense to make the store as bright as possible . Professor Xu said: ‘Marketers may also adjust the lightening levels in the retail environment, according to the nature of the products on sale. ‘If you are selling emotional expressive products such as flowers or engagement rings it would make sense to make the store as bright as possible.’ She thinks the effect is at its strongest on brighter days around noon when sunlight is the most abundant and in geographic regions that experience sunnier rather than cloudier days.","Researchers found that dimming the lights can help people make more rational decisions and settle negotiations more easily .

"A woman suffered a painful, five-day erection of the clitoris that left her barely able to stand. The 29-year-old had been taking medication to boost her libido, but had recently upped the dose, according to a medical report of her case. She was part of a clinical trial group taking the anti-depressant medications wellbutrin (bupropion) and . trazodone, the website LiveScience reports. Painful: A 29-year-old woman developed a permanent erection of the clitoris for five days. She had been taking two types of anti-depressant medication to boost her libido (file picture) When she began experiencing pain and swelling in her genital area, she stopped taking the drugs - but the symptoms got worse and worse. The woman was suffering from a condition called priapism. This usually affects men but in rare cases, can affect women too. The condition is where a penis or clitoris becomes engorged with blood, causing a painful, long-lasting erection. It is caused by a blockage of the blood vessels that empty the penis . Also, a number of medications can sometimes . disrupt the normal workings of the nerves that help trigger an erection . by widening the arteries in the penis. The nerves essentially . ‘forget’ to narrow the arteries after the feelings of sexual arousal . have passed, leading to priapism. Those that have been linked to priapism include anti-depressants (as this woman was taking), erectile dysfunction medication and some recreational drugs. The woman was diagnosed from a condition called priapism - for women, where the clitoris becomes engorged with blood, causing a painful, long-lasting erection . 'The pain had become debilitating, as she was unable to walk, sit, or stand without significant worsening of the pain,' according to the case report in the Journal of Sexual Medicine. When she was examined, doctors discovered her clitoris had become a purple colour and swollen to 2.0 × 0.7 centimeters (0.8 × 0.3 inches), LiveScience adds. The drugs the woman was taking, wellbutrin (bupropion) and . trazodone, block receptors in the body called alpha-adrenergic receptors. The decongestant Sudafed is known to stimulate these receptors, so doctors gave the woman a dose of this every six hours. A day later, the woman was discharged from hospital and recovered soon after.","29-year-old had been on a clinical trial taking medication to boost her libido .

"A group of six Iranian youths who filmed a video dancing around to Pharrell's song 'Happy' were sentenced on Wednesday to six months in prison and 91 lashes. The director of the video, Sassan Solemani, got a longer one-year sentence and the same amount of lashes. But the group had cause to celebrate, since the sentences are being suspended. That means, if they are not arrested again for three years the punishments will be dropped,  their lawyer Farshid Rofugaran told Iran Wire. 'A suspended sentence becomes null and void after a certain period of time,' Rofugaran said. 'When it’s a suspended sentence, the verdict is not carried out, but if during this period a similar offense is committed, then the accused is subject to legal punishment and the suspended sentence will then be carried out as well.' Scroll down for video . Sentenced: A group of six Iranian men and  women were sentenced on Wednesday to six months in prison and 91 lashes, after appearing in a video dancing to Pharrell's 'Happy'.

The three men who appeared in the video pictured above. The sentences will be suspended which means if they stay out of 'trouble' over the next three years, they won't receive the punishment. The group was arrested in May 2014, a month after the video went viral on YouTube. Iranian authorities allegedly found issue in the fact that the women were dancing alongside the men and not wearing a hijab. During their time behind bars, the three men and three women were humiliated and forced to go on national television to apologize for the video, saying they had been tricked into doing it. After making the confession, they were released on bail and some have even been able to travel in and out of the country, Rofugaran said. The group now has a choice whether to accept the verdict or appeal. 'I will do what my clients want me to do. We are happy that both the prison sentences and the lashes are suspended,' he said. The group has spent the last  week in Tehran court for their trial. Amnesty International UK's Head of Campaigns, Champa Patel, condemned the trial and told MailOnline: 'Arresting people for dancing in a video tribute to a song called Happy is taking things to a new level of dark irony even for the authoritarian Iranian authorities. Popular: The group of three men and three women who appear in the video were arrested last May after it went viral on YouTube . Dismay: Pharrell expressed his sadness at the arrest of the young Iranians . Conservative: Iranian authorities objected to the women dancing with the men in the video, while not wearing hijabs . 'Iran already stamps all over freedom of expression, banning the use of satellite dishes, filtering the internet, and jailing journalists, artists and film directors. The authorities should stop persecuting these people and drop this ludicrous case against them.' The friends were arrested in May after police took offense at the video, which shows three men and three unveiled women dancing in the streets and on the rooftops of Tehran. A description for the video said: 'We have made this video as Pharrell Williams' fans in 8hrs, with iPhone 5S. 'Happy' was an excuse to be happy. We enjoyed every second of making it. Hope it puts a smile on your face.' Williams protested the arrests on Facebook, posting: 'It is beyond sad that these kids were arrested for trying to spread happiness.' 'After a vulgar clip which hurt public chastity was released in cyberspace, police decided to identify those involved in making that clip,' said Tehran police chief Hossein Sajedinia .","A group of young Iranians were sentenced on Wednesday to six months in prison and 91 lashes for appearing in a video dancing to Pharrell's 'Happy'

"An alopecia sufferer who lost all the hair on her body has miraculously regrown a full head of hair after taking steroid medication for a chest infection. Sarah Ford’s hair started falling out in patches when she was 15 as the result of stress. She hated going to school as she was tormented by bullies - the police even had to be called on two occasions after she was assaulted. Scroll down for video . Happy family: Sarah Ford who started losing her hair when she was 15 with her children, Emily, eight and five-year-old Jay. Her hair erturned when she began taking steroid medication for a chest infection . By the age of 20 she was bald and by the age of 22 she had lost all the hair on her body – including her eyelashes and eyebrows. Mrs Ford, 26, said: ‘I was devastated when it started to go patchy – at that age all you think about is hair and make-up. Sarah Ford, 26, began losing her hair aged 15 (left) and by 20 she was totally bald (right) ‘I felt like I didn’t fit in and I was bullied quite badly at school. Losing my hair didn’t help matters. I made every excuse not to go to school.’ Her confidence plummeted and the mother-of-two spent nearly a decade bald and refused to go out without a scarf tied around her head. Hair loss – known as alopecia - can affect anyone. Some studies have found that women are more likely to be affected than men and alopecia in all its forms is estimated to affect one in 100 people in the UK - up to 600,000 sufferers. Mrs Ford began losing great clumps of hair. She could hide it when her hair was patchy but was devastated when it all fell out . Mrs Ford said: ‘I thought it was bad when I started to get patches but at least I could try and hide that. It was awful when I lost it all. ‘People would look at me and think I had cancer. I felt really self-conscious. ‘A woman even stopped me in the street and asked me what type of cancer I had because she’d had cancer. People just assume.’ She married her childhood sweetheart Neil Ford when she was 23 but instead of wearing a tiara with a flowing veil, she had to have a special headdress tailor-made. Mrs Ford married her childhood sweetheart Neil Ford when she was 23 but instead of wearing a tiara with a flowing veil, she had to have a special headdress tailor-made . The full-time mother went to the doctor in April last year as a chest infection was causing her asthma to flare up. They prescribed her a short-term high dose of steroids and within weeks her hair follicles were starting to regrow. Mrs Ford said: ‘I was so excited but I didn’t know if it was going to stay. It looked as if someone had shaved my head when it was starting to come through. ‘I’ve got a full head of hair now. I don’t have to think about how people will react or what scarf I will have to wear – I always tried to match them to my outfits. My confidence is improving.’ Mrs Ford said: ‘I’ve got a full head of hair now. I don’t have to think about how people will react or what scarf I will have to wear – I always tried to match them to my outfits. My confidence is improving’ Alopecia is usually treated with steroid injections or creams, but it does not work for everyone. Mrs Ford had not tried any treatments as a specialist had told her they were a ‘waste of time’. She said: ‘The dermatologist I saw back then was quite ignorant and just told me not to bother. ‘I want people with alopecia to know there is the possibility of your hair growing back even when you have been bald for years and to look into all the options. ‘I feel more confident and am getting used to going out without a scarf on. It had become a kind of security and it was very weird going out without it for the first time, but all my friends and family were very supportive.’ Husband Neil, 31, a construction worker, said: ‘I met my wife when she had alopecia and it’s never bothered me. I’ve always been saying to just go out and not worry. ‘If it makes her happy then it makes me happy. Her confidence has really improved and it’s great to see that.’ Mrs Ford asked her doctor if she could keep taking a low dose of the steroid medication but was told it would not be safe for her health. If oral steroids are taken for more than three months they can have serious side effects, including weight gain, thinning skin, muscle weakness, osteoporosis, high blood pressure and cataracts.","Sarah Ford, 26, began losing her hair when she was 15 and was bald at 20 .

"Criminal charges have been filed against a woman and two of her attorneys for falsely claiming she was sexually assaulted by a Saudi sheik's son in a scheme to extort at least $15 million, Los Angeles County prosecutors said Monday. Leyla Ors, Joseph Gerard Cavallo and Emanuel Karl Hudson were charged with attempted extortion, conspiracy to commit extortion, conspiracy to receive a bribe and conspiracy to obstruct justice, according to a statement from the district attorney's office. In addition, Ors, 33, was charged with one count of offering to receive a bribe by a witness. Ors, a German national, told police in March that she had been raped, beaten and kept prisoner by Thamer Albalwi, the 23-year-old son of Sheik Monsur Albalwi, one of the wealthiest men in Saudi Arabia, the district attorney's office said. Ors was Alballwi's personal assistant. Scroll down for video . Flalse claims: Los Angeles attorney Joseph Cavallo has been charged with trying to extort money from a wealthy Saudi sheik . Based on her allegations, a physical examination and visible injuries, the junior Albalwi was charged March 13 with four counts of sexual assault. In June, prosecutors allege, Hudson, 58, called Thamer Albalwi's father and told him that for $15 million, Ors would not testify against the son and 'the case would be over.' On the same day, Cavallo, 58, allegedly called the sheik and demanded $20 million, saying an account would be set up in Lucerne, Switzerland, to receive the cash. The three were arrested last week. The attorneys were released on bail, but Ors remained in custody. Her scheduled arraignment Monday was postponed until Tuesday when she asked for a German interpreter. Cavallo was scheduled for arraignment on Tuesday, and Hudson is expected to be arraigned July 31. If convicted, each of the defendants could face up to four years behind bars. The sexual assault case against Thamer Albalwi was dismissed on Friday. His attorneys issued a statement Monday saying that an investigation showed the Albalwi family was 'the target of a sophisticated, international extortion scheme.' Attorney Alan Jackson said that Superior Court Judge James R. Dabney issued a rare finding of 'factual innocence' concurring with the district attorney's office that that 'Albalwi was falsely accused of sexually assaulting a woman visiting him in Los Angeles.' Albalwi provided police with telephone and credit card records, emails, text messages and surveillance video which showed the accuser's allegations were false, Jackson said. Thamer Albalwi issued a statement saying, 'I prayed that the truth would come out and, thanks to the American justice system, it did.'","Leyla Ors, a German national, worked as a personal assistant to Thamer Albalwi, son of Sheik Monsur Albalwi .

"Sen. Rand Paul told a group of college students on Wednesday that Ebola is 'incredibly contagious' and can spread from a person who has the disease to someone standing three feet away and said the White House should be honest about that. His comments directly conflict with statements from world health authorities who have dealt with Ebola outbreaks since 1976. Paul, a doctor and a presumed GOP presidential contender, made his comments during a stop at Plymouth State University in New Hampshire. In his remarks, he suggested Ebola could spread at a cocktail party attended by someone who is symptomatic, according to CNN video footage. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Sen. Rand Paul is greeted by New Hampshire GOP Chair Jennifer Horn at the party headquarters on Thursday in Concord. The likely 2016 Republican presidential candidate was in the nation's first presidential primary state yesterday to rally voters ahead of November's midterm elections . Paul walks through a crowd of young Republicans at the state GOP headquarters. While Paul was speaking before a group of college students yesterday, he intimated that the White House is lying about easily Ebola can spread . Paul has made similar comments in the wake of the first diagnosis of Ebola in the U.S. earlier this month. The Kentucky senator told a conservative radio show host that 'we should not underestimate the transmissibility' of the virus and warned that society may not be 'making sound, rational, scientific decisions' about Ebola 'because of political correctness.' 'It's a big mistake to downplay and act as if ""oh, this is not a big deal, we can control all this."" This could get beyond our control,' Paul, who has an MD in optometry from Duke University, told Laura Ingraham. 'My suspicion is that it's a lot more transmissible than that if people who are taking every precaution are getting it.' Since Paul first lobbed the accusations at the government, two more people within the United States have come down with Ebola. On Wednesday Paul said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention makes the transmission of Ebola sound similar to that of AIDS. Ebola, he says, is easier to contract. 'You're not going to get AIDS at a cocktail party. No one's going to cough on you and you're going to get AIDS. Everybody knows that. That's what they make it sound exactly like,' Paul said. 'But then you listen to them closely, they say you have to have direct contact. But you know how they define direct contact? Being within three feet of someone.' The Kentucky senator made phone calls to rally voters at the state GOP party headquarters . Likewise in the epidemic zone in West Africa, people involved with burials of highly infectious bodies are at high risk. 'Should you be worried you might have gotten it by sitting next to someone?' Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the CDC, said Wednesday. 'The answer to that is no.' Still, Paul's team pointed to the CDC's website that says being within three feet of an infected patient for a prolonged period of time without the proper gear is a 'low-risk exposure' for Ebola. 'I think from the very beginning they haven't been completely forthright with us,' Paul told Bloomberg News on Thursday. 'They have so wanted to downplay this that they really, I don't think, have been very accurate in their description of the disease.' Politicians across the political spectrum have weighed in on President Barack Obama's response to the arrival of Ebola in the United States, with more than 40 calling for travel bans to West African countries that are being ravaged by the disease. The first U.S. patient diagnosed with Ebola, Thomas Eric Duncan, came to the United States from Liberia shortly before his diagnosis. The other two people diagnosed with Ebola in the United States cared for Duncan when he was in the hospital. President Barack Obama said on Thursday that 'a flat-out travel ban is not the way to go.' The White House explained Thursday afternoon that it believes that placing travel restrictions on Ebola hot spots will just encourage people from those countries who wish to travel to the U.S. to go 'underground' and find other ways to enter the country that allow them to bypass Ebola screenings. It also asserted that a ban on travel from West Africa would make it difficult to send cargo critical to stopping the spread of Ebola to the region, as commercial airlines would most likely be unwilling to come back empty handed. Instead, the president ordered heightened screenings at the international airports that 94 percent of West Africans come to America through. Congressional lawmakers who participated in a rare recess hearing on Capitol Hill yesterday said they believed a moratorium on travel from Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone is necessary to keep more carriers of the disease from entering the country.","Paul, a doctor by trade, claimed Ebola can spread from a person who has the disease to someone standing three feet away .

"Confident: German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said he expects Luxembourg to drop its opposition . European Union finance ministers failed once again today to agree on a sweeping new policy to fight tax evasion because of resistance from Luxembourg - a tiny country that long has prospered from a secretive banking culture. EU Taxation Commissioner Algirdas Semeta said their failure was disappointing because, if approved, the legislation proposing an EU-wide automatic exchange of data on bank deposits would allow governments to identify and chase up tax evaders. Luxembourg, a duchy of barely 500,000 people, was able to shelve the legislation for the 28-nation bloc and its 500 million citizens because the decision required unanimous approval at today's meeting in Brussels. Luxembourg Finance Minister Pierre Gramegna said he could not vote in favour and pushed the decision to a summit of EU government leaders next week. Luxembourg has insisted for years it would support the proposed law only if non-EU banking hubs within Europe, particularly Switzerland, also sign up. But as the EU's negotiations with Switzerland, Liechtenstein and three other nations on signing the agreement have made progress, Luxembourg has responded with new reasons for opposition, chiefly the risk that banks outside Europe would draw deposits away if the continent's banking rules are tightened too much. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said he was confident that Luxembourg would drop its opposition at next week's summit. 'We've been working on this for such a long time, whether we agree today or in four weeks, that doesn't kill me either,' he said. EU officials say tax fraud and companies' aggressive cross-border tax avoidance schemes cost the bloc's governments an estimated 1 trillion euros (£830billion) a year - money needed in an age of sluggish growth and high debt across Europe. Greek finance minister Yannis Stournaras (pictured left in December) said progress had been made in drawing up proposals to protect taxpayers from future bank bailouts . The finance ministers did achieve some progress today. They drafted compromise proposals designed to break a deadlock between EU governments and the European Parliament on how to set up an agency that could restructure or shut down failing banks, the EU's so-called 'single resolution mechanism'. The agency is intended to help stabilise the financial system and reduce the risk that taxpayers would have to fund future bank bailouts. Greek Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras said the new proposals sought to address lawmakers' criticisms. He and other finance ministers declined to provide details. The proposals are to be presented at negotiations with lawmakers tomorrow in Strasbourg, France. To avoid significant delays in setting up the agency, an agreement between the EU's governments and European Parliament leaders must be reached by the end of March. That would leave time for the legislation to be voted on before the Parliament dissolves for May elections. Lawmakers have complained that the EU's original proposals gave national governments and regulators too much influence over the rescue authority's decisions, leaving room to play politics and give advantage to their domestic banks. The new bank-rescue fund would be financed by a levy on banks that would raise 55 billion euros (£45billion) over 10 years by 2026. However before the fund would be tapped, a failing bank's creditors, including holders of large deposits, would be forced to take losses.","Luxembourg able to shelve proposal as decision need to be unanimous .

"The grandparents of an 8-year-old Virginia girl took her out of the Christian school she'd been attending all year after they received a letter telling them that if she didn't stop dressing like a boy she would be refused enrollment for the next school year. Rather than give the school the chance to humiliate their granddaughter, Sunnie Kahle's grandparents - and legal guardians - Doris and Carrol Thompson took her out of the Timberlake Christian School in Timberlake, Virginia, and are now sending her to public school. Sunnie has short hair, likes sports and wears muddy sneakers when other girls her age might be wearing something more feminine. Sunnie: Sunnie, 8, has short hair, likes sports and wears t-shirts and jeans - which isn't up to the standards of her Christian school . Insulted: Sunnie's grandparents, Carroll (left) and Doris Thompson decided to pull Sunnie from Timberlake and send her to private school . Timberlake Christian School feels that Sunnie's appearance doesn't meet its 'biblical standards' for a young girl's appearance. 'You're probably aware that Timberlake Christian School is a . religious, Bible believing institution providing education in a . distinctly Christian environment,' the letter sent to the Thompsons - and shared with WSET - said. It goes on to say that other students are confused about whether Sunnie is a boy or a girl. 'Christian': The school sent the Thompsons a letter explaining that Sunnie's appearance didn't meet the school's 'biblical standards . Sad: Sunnie wants to go back to Timberlake because her friends are all there . In the letter, administrators remind the Thompsons that the school can refuse to admit a student if that student is 'condoning sexual immorality, practicing a homosexual . lifestyle or alternative gender identity.' It then goes on to cite specific Bible versus. 'We believe that unless Sunnie as well as her family clearly understand . that God has made her female and her dress and behavior need to follow . suit with her God-ordained identity, that TCS is not the best place for . her future education,' the letter from the school's principal, Becky Bowman stated. 'How do you label a child, eight years old, or discriminate against an . eight year old child? It just don't happen,' Carroll Thompson told the station. Dorris quotes Sunnie saying 'I'm a girl, I know I'm a girl' and says that if she wants to go out and 'play in the mud' that's fine with her. Good student: The school even says that Sunnie is a good student, but her appearance is a 'distraction' Identity: The school implied Sunnie is confused about her gender, but she says she knows she's a girl . However, Sunnie misses her friends at Timberlake Christian. 'She cries every morning to get on the bus, she cries when she comes . home because she wants to go back to Timberlake Christian with her . friends,' said Doris Thompson. The school maintains that they have not accused Sunnie of 'being anything or anyone' and that the school is just asking that she follow guidelines set forth for every student. The Thompsons, however, have no interest in re-enrolling their granddaughter at Timberlake Christian.","Timberlake Christian School told the grandparents of an 8-year-old girl that her appearance didn't meet the school's 'biblical standards .

"World poverty is shrinking and developing countries are becoming less poor according to a new study by Oxford University. Nepal, Rwanda and Bangladesh were the 'star performers' of the 22-country study carried out by the  Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI), followed by Ghana, Tanzania, Cambodia and Bolivia. The report predicts that some of the poorest countries in the world could see acute poverty eradicated within 20 years. The department measured poverty by using a new term called the Multidimensional Poverty Index, or MPI. It measures the intensity of different deprivations that poor people face including nutrition, education and sanitation and not just income. Researchers have devised a new term for measuring poverty called the Multidimensional Poverty Index which is shown along the bottom of the graph. The lighter bar shows the original MPI and the darker bar shows the current MPI . If people are deprived in a third or more of ten indicators, the global index identifies them as 'MPI poor'. The study was carried out by Dr Sabina Alkire and Dr Jose Manuel Roche. Dr Alkire said: 'Using this measure, we found that reductions in intensity – the percentage of deprivations people experience at the same time – were strongest in relatively poorer countries, such as Ethiopia, Malawi and Senegal.' In some countries, if progress continues at the same rate, current generations may see the end of acute multidimensional poverty. If people are deprived in a third or more of ten indicators, the global index identifies them as 'MPI poor' For example, if the study’s 'star' countries, Nepal, Rwanda, and Bangladesh, continue to reduce poverty at the current rate, they will halve MPI in less than 10 years and eradicate it in 20. However, the future for other countries does not look as positive. ‘At the current rate of reduction, it will take Ethiopia 45 years to halve multidimensional poverty; in other words, to achieve poverty levels equivalent to those Nigeria has now,’ said OPHI’s Dr José Manuel Roche, who calculated the predictions. ‘Based on the same assumptions, it will take India 41 years and Malawi 74 years to eradicate acute poverty as measured by the MPI. 'But we hope that by providing a more complete and balanced picture, these measures will help spur the eradication of multidimensional poverty.’ Improvements: Nepal did the best in areas like nutrition and child mortality . Nepal did the best in areas like nutrition, child mortality, electricity, improved flooring and assets. Rwanda showed the biggest improvement in sanitation and water, and Bangladesh did best in improving sanitation and school attendance. The MPI can also be broken down to reveal the varying rates of progress in different regions of a country or among different social groups. For example, in Nepal, although it had an outstanding overall performance, three of the 13 regions lagged behind the rest of the country, with no statistically significant reduction in MPI poverty. By contrast, Rwanda and Bangladesh achieved significant reductions in both the scale and intensity of multidimensional poverty in every one of their regions. ‘This ability of the MPI to reveal inequalities at a regional level, as well as between social groups, makes it a vital tool for policymakers,’ said Dr Suman Seth, one of OPHI’s research team. ‘The global MPI allows us to compare people’s poverty and see in what ways they are deprived, in order to address these interconnected deprivations and target interventions more accurately.’ The release of the report on changes in poverty over time follows the publication of the MPI in the UN Development Programme's Human Development Report 2013. In 2013, OPHI found that a total of 1.6billion people are living in multidimensional poverty - more than 30 per cent of the combined populations of the 104 countries analysed. It is the first time research has tracked overlapping deprivations in health, education and living standards.","Poverty levels in Nepal, Rwanda and Bangladesh have dropped .

"A friend of Ched Evans has claimed how the disgraced footballer shot him with an air rifle, before offering him more than £10,000 to keep it quiet. Andrew Barnes, 25, was allegedly shot in the thigh by former Welsh striker Evans, also 25, who had been hiding behind a garage shed at Mr Barnes’s parents' home in Stretford, Greater Manchester. After he had been shot with the gas-fired air rifle, the business consultant was taken to hospital with a pellet lodged in his bones - but doctors left it there over fears that removing it would be unsafe. Friend of Ched Evans: Andrew Barnes (pictured) was allegedly shot in the thigh by the former Welsh striker, who had been hiding behind a garage shed at Mr Barnes’s parents' home in Stretford, Greater Manchester . Legal action: Mr Barnes (left) is pictured with pellets and showing the area on his inner thigh were he was shot. Evans was seen with his girlfriend Natasha Massey (right) in Alderley Edge, Cheshire, on Monday afternoon . Mr Barnes told The Sun’s Lauren Veevers: ‘I could see a hole in my thigh where the pellet had gone. Doctors said it was only my bone that stopped it going all the way through my leg and out again. ‘How can someone in their right mind fire an air rifle at a friend? He was quite far away when he fired. Had he moved the gun by millimetres, it could have hit my chest and killed me.’ Evans was said to have been concerned about his employers Manchester City finding out what had happened - but Mr Barnes’s mother told chiefs at the club, which allegedly landed Evans in trouble. The footballer and his friend Clayton McDonald - who was cleared in the rape trial over the incident at a hotel in North Wales in May 2011 - had reportedly been lodging at Mr Barnes’s parents' house. Mr Barnes claimed that before the shooting incident in 2009, he had seen Evans peering round the garage at the home and pointing the gun at him from about 50ft (15 metres) away. He added: ‘Then I felt something in my leg and realised he shot me. Ched was always shooting things in the garden.’ Thigh hole: Hospital X-rays showing the pellet still in Andrew's leg. The business consultant was taken to hospital with a pellet lodged in his bones - but doctors left it there over fears that removing it would be unsafe . Video: Evans (left) broke his public silence to insist he had committed an ‘act of infidelity’ not rape. He told his long-suffering girlfriend Natasha Massey (right) he was sorry for cheating on her with the drunken 19-year-old . Mr Barnes said his mother found pellets in cupboard doors, walls, sinks, window frames and even the fridge. He said that shortly after the incident happened he launched legal action against Evans. Police allegedly questioned Evans and McDonald but no charges were brought. Just before Evans’s rape trial, he offered Mr Barnes a £10,900 payout with a gagging agreement. The footballer was convicted of rape in April 2012, and the next month a £10,000 payout was agreed - for injuries and legal costs. Last night, Evans broke his public silence to insist he had committed an ‘act of infidelity’ not rape. He told his long-suffering girlfriend Natasha Massey that he was sorry for cheating on her with the drunken 19-year-old. It was Evans’s first public statement since being freed last Friday halfway through his five-year jail sentence for rape. It came in a video posted on a website set up to try to clear his name. But Evans did not apologise for what happened to the woman in a hotel room, claiming it was ‘consensual and not rape’. Striker: Sheffield United has denied offering Evans a new contract but refused to rule out signing him again . The woman, now 22, has been forced to move away from friends and family in North Wales and take on a new identity after nine people were convicted of illegally naming her. Miss Massey’s millionaire father Karl is bankrolling the fight to quash his conviction, including taking on a new legal team which has submitted evidence to the Criminal Cases Review Commission. It is fast-tracking a decision on whether to back a second appeal after senior judges rejected the first in 2012. Sheffield United has denied offering Evans a new contract but refused to rule out signing him again. A petition set up by a feminist blogger using the pseudonym Jean Hatchet urging the club not to reinstate Evans has 150,000 signatures. And BBC veteran Michael Buerk was attacked by campaigners yesterday for saying Evans’s victim did not come out ‘with any credit as she had ‘drunk so much she could barely stand’. The website set up to try to clear Evans’s name says he will not be speaking to the media, and that numerous requests for exclusive interviews with him have all been declined.","Andrew Barnes was 'shot in thigh' at parents' Greater Manchester home .

"It's all the fault of the Women's Institute. Since the good ladies of Rylstone WI stripped off for charity in 1999, the public has been assailed by a flood of naked calendars. We've seen naked firemen, semi-clad carpenters, stripped butchers, bare bakers - in all probability, there is a calendar somewhere that features a bunch of unclothed candlestick makers, coyly covering their bits with tapers. Now, we have the ladies of the Camp Hill Rugby Club, who have just launched their own black and white effort. And it's quite possibly the worst yet. The girls of the Camps Hill Rugby Club get their kit off for January as a man - a coach, perhaps? - checks their studs . Team manager Jessica Ham said: 'We're pleased with the way it came out; we wanted it to be fun and tasteful' The all-female team got their kit off to raise money for their club. Perhaps keen to save pennies, they appear to have neglected to engage the services of a professional photographer and shot the pictures in a dingy pub and what appears to be their club changing rooms. Lighting is also an issue. No-one looks good under a harsh, fluorescent bulb, least of all a naked rugby prop forward. The girls are seen sprawled over pool tables and a sticky-looking bar top in the grotty drinking den. In a grimy corridor one girl is laid out on a stretcher in almost complete darkness whilst four other semi-clad ladies surround her. In one particularly disturbing scene, the girls are posed with bottoms facing camera as a man lurks in the gloom, bending down to check their boots.

"A man going to the aid of a drowning woman in southern France watched in horror as his wife and daughter were then swept away in their caravan as flooding across central Europe last night claimed another five lives. The latest area to be devastated by the worst flooding the area has experienced in decades, was Lamalou-les-Bains, where a quiet river swelled into a raging torrent and ripped through a camping ground and across the village, collecting and destroying everything in its path. The towns mayor, Philippe Thailland, has described the heartbreaking scene, involving a man in his 60s, clinging on to a drowning woman, only to witness his own family being swept swept. Resting place: A destroyed car can be seen in the foreground, left, and another sits atop fallen trees and debris, from floods that raged through Lamalou-les-Bains, in southern France, where six people have so far been confirmed dead .

A firefighter stands next to a destroyed camper in the town which has been split open and hangs on the edge of a bridge next to trees that have been ripped apart . The man was . unable to save the woman, and later his wife was found dead in her . caravan, which was found stuck under a bridge. His 34-year-old daughter remains missing. More than 80 deaths had been confirmed before the latest casualties added to the tally. At least 58 died in the Black Sea area over the weekend, where thousands . of Russian tourists were caught out by flood waters that swept cars and . tents out to sea. Thousands of British tourists are being forced . to cancel holidays amid the chaos. One of the worst-hit cities is . Prague, where more than 50,000 people, including foreign visitors, were . evacuated as the floods threaten to engulf the Czech capital. The camping . ground in Lamalou-les-Bains was hit by floods that had . already claimed the life of an elderly woman in Aveyron, and left . another person unaccounted for. At . the camping ground, a man and woman were found dead in separate . caravans. The salvaged and soaking remains of a family's belongings are placed on a fence outside their home in Lamalou-les-Bains, as they begin the heartbreaking task of cleaning up and seeing what property can be saved .

Rescuers said a third person was swept away by a wave more . than seven feet high and that two other bodies had been found, but they . were yet to determine if they were those of two people still reported . missing. Lamalou-les-Bains today remained a muddy mess. Fallen trees covered roads and upturned vehicles were scattered about, as firemen and local residents began pumping water out of properties and doing their best to clean up while the weather remained steady. The area remains under risk, forecasters have said. Storms are expected later today and will continue into the weekend. Villager who refuses to evacuate home captures raging waters tearing through his Serbian village . Meanwhile, in Serbia a video has emerged showing just how devastating raging water can be. The torrent of water raged through Tekija, in eastern Serbia, absorbing and destroying everything in its path.Trees, the wooden frames of houses and cars became part of the wall of water. Hundreds of people were evacuated from their homes because of the flood danger, but at least person is known to have died as a result. The footage was captured by one villager who refused to leave his home. The flooding started in the Balkans last week with heavy rain falls in neighbouring Croatia, before it spread to Serbia where rain swollen rivers also swept away bridges and roads and cut off power supplies and telephones lines. A total of 15 villages are in danger in the Kladovo region, near the border with Romania, where main roads connecting the area with the rest of Serbia have been either flooded or destroyed. The region has only recently recovered from heavy flooding in May of this year that also claimed several lives.","As a man goes to the rescue of a drowning woman, his own wife and daughter are swept away .

"From Pennyhill to Whynot passing through Lizard Lick on the way to Pig, America is full of funny and downright silly town names. And behind every one of those strange names is the obscure story of how that place came to be known and in some cases celebrated by its residents. Take the tiny hamlet of Tightwad for starters. Very tight lender: The town of Tightwad, Missouri, famous for Tightwad Bank . With a population of 64, the small town southeast of Kansas City was named after the postmaster was cheated in a watermelon deal at the local store in the early 1990's. Simply out of spite, he took advantage of his privilege as town postmaster and renamed the town Tightwad. Retaining that moniker to this day, the major attraction in the town is the humorously named Tightwad Bank, which is Federally insured and ironically classified as 'well capitalised'. No Name nowhere: Stuck between No Name Canyon and No Name Creek the residents of No Name are proud of their town's history . However, if parsimonious town names don't do it for you then why not take a stroll through No Name, Colorado, if you can find it. Sandwiched conveniently between No Name Canyon and No Name Creek, the town with no name began after the major Interstate 70 was built. An official with the Department of Transportation noticed that the area did not carry a sobriquet on the map and wrote 'No Name' for Exit 119. Inspiring the local community with its absurdity the name stuck and when later the residents were offered the opportunity to change to a more traditional designation the community chose to remain nameless. Elephant Butte: One of New Mexico's top tourist destinations is at the other end of the highway from Truth or Consequences . The plight of a nameless town in Colorado is brought into perspective when one is faced with a fork in the road that offers Truth or Consequences as one destination and Elephant Butte as the other. Seemingly caught between a double dare or a herd of escaped circus performers you would be forgiven for scratching your head. In fact the name Elephant Butte refers to a volcanic cone that slightly resembles the animal's silhouette in the middle of a reservoir that is a favourite vacation spot in the state of New Mexico. Goldrush town: Unable to spell the name of the local grouse that lives in the area the locals settled on Chicken insteadd . If calling a town after a local landmark that slightly resembles an animal is one way of doing it then spare a thought for the Alaskan outpost of Chicken. Populated by large numbers of the ptarmigan, which is a type of grouse, the gold-prospectors in the area wanted to name their new town after the bird. However, because no one could agree on the correct spelling and to avoid ridicule the locals named their township Chicken instead. One of the few remaining gold-rush towns in Alaska, Chicken has no phone service, no electricity and its population fluctuates between 17 and 37. Staple diet: Named following a flood in the 1800's the rabbit hash was all you could eat in the town for years . From too many birds to too many bunnies in the town of Rabbit Hash, Kentucky. Named following an 1847 flood that washed everything in the town bar the prolific rabbit population away, the rebuilding residents had to dine on the floppy eared survivors for years afterwards. So much so that they named their town after what had become their staple meal. Nirmrod: The town's sign is bolted down to stop the repeated theft that kept on occuring . However, for sheer silliness the town of Nimrod, Oregon has it covered. Named after a mighty biblical hunter, the town welcomes thousands of tourists each year looking to have their picture taken under the  welcome sign. After many attempts to steal it Nimrodians have now taken to having their sign bolted down. The longest and silliest of them all: All 58 letters of Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch . Undoubtedly though, the king of stupid town names is Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch in Wales. With 58 letters the name translates to St. Mary's Church in the Hollow of the White Hazel Near to the Rapid Whirlpool of Llantysilio of the Red Cave. Although not authentic Welsh, the name was an 1860's publicity stunt created by the railway station so that it would have the longest name in Britain.","The history behind some of America's weird and unusual town names .

"A Fox News host has issued an apology after making a sexist comment about a female fighter pilot earlier this week on The Five. During a segment about Maj.

Now, after outrage from viewers, and even his own wife, following these insensitive remarks, he has apologized. Scroll down for video . Sorry: Fox News host Eric Bolling (left) has apologized after making sexist comments on his program The Five earlier this week that upset many, including cohost Kimberly Guilfoyle (right) Tacky: Boling and panelis Greg Gutfeld made sexist comments about Maj. Mariam Al Mansouri (above), a female pilot from the United Arab Emirates who led a mission this week against ISIS in Syria . 'I made a joke and when I got home, I got the look, and realized some people didn't think it was funny at all,' Bolling said on the air today. 'I said sorry to my wife and I apologize to all of you as well and want to make that very clear.' This all began when Bolling's cohost, Kimberly Guilfoyle, praised Maj. Mansouri on the program Wednesday afternoon. 'Hey ISIS, you were bombed by a woman,' Guilfoyle said. 'Oh yeah, hell came down on ISIS in Syria, because guess what: the first female pilot piloting for the [United Arab Emirates], there she was, leading the strikes. Dropped the bombs on ISIS Monday night.' Maj. Mansouri, 35, was the first woman to join the Emirati Air Force. 'This is really incredible,' Guilfoyle continued. 'Major Mariam Al Mansouri is who did this. Remarkable, very excited. I wish it was an American pilot. I'll take a woman doing this any day to them. Right after she said this, the men on the panel began making sexist jokes.

At this point Guilfoyle became visibly upset with the men, and asked them why they were 'ruining her thing.' Later that day, Fox News anchor Greta van Susteren took the boys to task on her eponymous show. 'Do you think the gents on ""The Five,"" minus Bob, should get a do-over on that one? They're going to get in so much trouble for that one,' she said. Gutfeld still has yet to apologize for his statement. Sadly, it seems that Maj. Mansouri is used to these comments, telling CNN in an interview earlier this summer, 'Whenever a woman enters a new male-dominated field, they find the same hesitation, the same prejudice, the same stereotype thinking.","Eric Bolling has apologized for a sexist joke he made about Maj.

"A lawyer for Michael Skakel is seeking to keep the government from using audio tapes made by the Kennedy cousin for a memoir as evidence in his upcoming murder retrial. Skakel, the nephew of Robert F. Kennedy's widow, Ethel, was freed from prison last year after a judge ruled his trial attorney failed to adequately represent him in 2002 when he was convicted of fatally bludgeoning Martha Moxley in Greenwich when they were both 15. Skakel's new attorney on Tuesday sought to suppress the evidence seized from ghostwriter Richard Hoffman and return it to Skakel. Attorney Stephen Seeger says an investigator misled Hoffman to get the tapes, on which Skakel says he masturbated in a tree outside Moxley's window the night she was killed. Michael Christopher Skakel (right), a Kennedy cousin, leaves court in Stamford, Connecticut on Tuesday with his lawyer. Skakel is seeking to suppress audiotape evidence in his upcoming murder retrial where he is heard saying he masturbated outside the victim's window on the night she died . Skakel was granted bail last November while prosecutors in Connecticut appeal a ruling giving him a new trial in the 1975 slaying of neighbor Martha Moxley. Bail was set at $1.2 million for the 53-year-old. As conditions of the bail, the judge ordered that Skakel live in Connecticut and wear a GPS tracking device. 'He's . one of the most recognized faces of America, so he's not going . anywhere,' defense attorney Hubert Santos said, noting that Skakel . always showed up for court appearances. Santos said after the hearing ended that Skakel was 'very happy' about the outcome. A . judge ruled last month that Skakel's trial attorney, Michael Sherman, . failed to adequately represent Skakel in 2002 when he was convicted in . Moxley's bludgeoning with a golf club in wealthy Greenwich when they . were both 15. Judge Thomas Bishop said Sherman . failed to locate a witness who backed up Skakel's alibi that he was at . his cousin's house the night of the murder and failed to find a man who . challenged a star witness's claim that Skakel confessed. Freedom at last: Michael Skakel, accused in the 1975 slaying of neighbor Martha Moxley, stands outside Stamford Superior Court in Stamford November after being released on bail, also pictured his attorney Jessica Santos . 'This . is the first step in correcting a terrible wrong,' the Skakel family . said in a statement. 'We look forward to Michael being vindicated and . justice finally being served.' Outside . court, Moxley's brother John and mother, Dorthy, said they disagreed . with the bail decision, continue to believe Skakel killed Martha and are . confident he will be convicted again at a new trial. 'I'm . disappointed. ...I guess we knew that the day would come,' Dorthy . Moxley said. 'I wasn't completely destroyed, but I wish it didn't . happen.' Added John Moxley: 'We have nothing to say to Michael.' Martha Moxley was killed on Oct. 30, 1975, Michael Skakel's conviction in her death has been set aside and a new trial ordered. He has been out on bail since November . Weapon: This photo evidence used at trial shows the murder weapon, a 6 iron golf club that belonged to the late mother of Tommy and Michael Skakel . Martha Moxley was out causing . mischief on Devil's Night, the night before Halloween, in 1976. She was . ringing doorbells, spraying shaving cream, throwing eggs, and toilet . papering homes in her elite gated community in Greenwich, Connecticut. The last house she happened upon was that of Michael and his brother Tommy Skakel. She left no later than 11pm, to walk the 150 yards or so to her neighboring house. But she never got there. Instead, her body was found beneath a tree in her back yard. She had been bludgeoned with a 6 iron golf club so powerfully that the shaft had shattered. Martha had been impaled in the neck with a shard from the shattered club. Her pants had been removed, along with her underwear, but there were no signs of sexual assault. Tommy . and Michael were initially suspects in the case after it was discovered . that the murder weapon had belonged to their late mother. Long . believed to have been bungled from the start, many believed police gave . the rich family special treatment in the case and ignored, or failed to . even look for, incriminating evidence.

Tessa Evans has complete congenital arhinia, an extremely rare condition which means she was born without a nose . The condition means Tessa has no sense of smell and no sinuses but she can cough, sneeze and catch a cold. And despite her difficulties, she always has a smile on her face, her mother Gráinne says. 'At first I just couldn't understand it, I didn't even know it was possible. 'How did my little girl not have a nose? Was she going to live? Would anyone be able to help her? 'But ever since we got her home she's grown every day, smiled more and the more she shines the more her differences fade into the background. Tessa Evans with her parents Nathan and Grainne. They decided to share her daughter's story to raise awareness of the condition, which is thought to affect around 40 people . 'Tessa is . so petite but she's the most determined little girl I know, she adores . her big brother and sister, copies everything they do and despite her . ""disabilities"" is already a typical toddler who climbs the furniture and . loves to dance. Arhinia is the absence of the nose and parts of the olfactory (the sense of smell) system. One type is congenital arhinia (where the person is born with it), another is acquired arhinia (loss of the nose to cancer, infection, or accident). It can be total (complete absence of the external nose and all/or parts of the olfactory (the sense of smell) system, the website Widesmiles reports. Or, it can be partial (only parts of the external nose and olfactory system is missing). 'Everyone who meets her instantly falls in love with her, we just want her to inspire other people like she inspires us.' Just . weeks after giving birth, while researching the condition on the . internet, she came across a journal online which stated that babies born . like Tessa had poor mental and physical development. She claims it implied that parents should be given the option to terminate their pregnancy. Mrs Evans, a full time carer from Maghera, County Derry, says her daughter proves that statement wrong. Recalling the birth, she said: 'As soon as I saw her face I knew something was wrong. 'I was in shock and I just froze. The midwife cut the cord before I could even say anything and whisked her away from me.' Tessa's condition was detected during the 20-week scan which showed an abnormally flat facial profile. Her mother and father - Nathan, 32, a nightclub manager - were told to prepare to make difficult decisions but the follow up 3D scan and tests revealed Tessa was perfectly healthy and everything was normal. But the birth was extremely traumatic. 'Doctors were able to stabilize her so she could breathe on her own and eventually I was allowed to hold her for a few seconds,' recalls Mrs Evans. 'I kissed her forehead and told her I loved her before they took her away.' essa was also born with other problems related to her condition, including a tiny hole in her heart and problems with her sight . 'I felt so . lonely and helpless, I was supposed to protect my baby and be able to . help but I couldn't. There were tubes coming out of her tiny little body . everywhere. 'She spent her first five weeks in a neonatal intensive care unit which were undoubtedly the worst weeks of my life.' There are just 47 recorded cases in the English records of people with partial or full facial anomalies and Mrs Evans admits she was worried about what people would think of her daughter's face. 'I found it a real struggle and was too scared of what people would think of her to even go outside at first, ' she said. But she found the confidence after seeking support from the charity 'Changing Faces' and cranio-facial charity 'Headlines'. 'Wearing Tessa in a sling gave me the confidence to first go out in public, since it gave me control over who could see her.' 'Now when we're out and about I'm no longer afraid of what people might think. In fact I think she will help people see that 'different' can be beautiful too.' Tessa will shortly begin treatment at Great Ormond Street Hospital. The procedure will design a nose-shaped mould which can be inserted through an incision along her hairline and placed where her nose should be . She added: 'Tessa is no longer a silent baby thanks to a special speaking valve. She runs around, plays outside and can . blow the most gorgeous kisses.' Tessa will shortly begin treatment at Great Ormond Street Hospital. The procedure will design a nose-shaped mould which can be inserted through an incision along her hairline and placed where her nose should be. Her 'nose' will be replaced with a bigger one every couple of year as she grows. 'We've explored different options but we settled on the least invasive one which will have the least drastic effect on her appearance,' said Mrs Evans. Her mother Grainne says using a sling gave her the confidence to first go out in public, as it gave her control over who could see Tessa . 'She is totally perfect to us the way she is, but we have to think about what will make life as normal as possible for her in the long run. It's not been an easy decision.' Tessa was also born with other problems related to her condition, including a tiny hole in her heart and problems with her sight. At just 11 weeks old she needed surgery to remove a cataract on her left eye but complications left her completely blind in that eye. She also needed a tracheostomy fitted to allow her to breathe while eating and sleeping. Despite having a difficult start to life, Tessa has always been healthy and met all her milestones, her mother says. She has decided to share her daughter's story after learning about an American family who were inspired to adopt a little girl with Arhinia - called Cassidy Hooper  -  in Ukraine who was in an orphanage. 'I hope Tessa's story inspires other people and families, I never want any child to be unloved or left alone because of their differences and diagnosis' 'I can't believe how much can change in a year. I  was so worried about my little girl when she was born but she's defied all the odds and I am so proud and grateful to be her mummy.' Her husband Nathan added: 'We know there are still challenges and multiple surgeries to come but when she flashes that cheeky grin of hers, it's all worth it.' Tessa's parents have set up a fund to help ease the financial strain that caring for Tessa's complex medical needs brings.

"Attempting to tame one of the largest and most fearsome lizards in the world is no easy feat. But zoo keepers in San Diego have managed to do just that with the help of a GoPro camera to track the progress a 14-year-old Komodo dragon. The dragon, named Sunny, is a meat-eating, fast-moving predator that can kill large prey with his deadly venom and razor-sharp teeth. Scroll down for video . Fearsome: Attempting to tame one of the largest lizards in the world is no easy feat. But zoo keepers in San Diego have managed to do just that with the help of a GoPro camera to track the progress of Sunny (pictured) The 9ft (2.7 metre) creature has been taught to walk towards a series of yellow targets, getting a treat if he manages to complete the task successfully. Despite its terrifying reputation, this Komodo dragon often responds to its keepers call by waddling towards the targets. As Komodo dragons spend most of their time resting in the sun, the training provides much-needed exercise for Sunny throughout the day. And once he masters the trick, keepers can ask Sunny to move into a different area of the exhibit. On target: The 9ft (2.7 metre) creature has been taught to walk towards a series of yellow targets, getting a treat if he manages to complete the task successfully . Poser: Born at the Honolulu Zoo in 2000, Sunny arrived in San Diego six years later and is now one of three Komodo Dragons at the attraction . Komodo dragons, the world's largest lizards, are found on the Indonesian island of Komodo. They have a stocky body, with bulky legs, scaly skin for camouflage and a long powerful tail. Males can measure up to 10ft (3m) in length and weight 176lbs (80kg). They smell prey from a mile away and eat wild buffalo, pigs deer, snakes and fish. There are 6,000 Komodo dragons in existence and only about 350 breeding females . They eat mainly meat and can consume up to 80 per cent of its body weight at one time. A Komodo dragon has about 60 sharp teeth to cut and tear flesh and can run as fast as humans. The training is also helpful if medical attention is needed, as Sunny could voluntarily move without the need for sedation.

"The doctor convicted of killing Michael Jackson has spoken out for the first time to try to clear his name - and claims the superstar died of an accidental overdose. Dr Conrad Murray told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I did not kill Michael Jackson. He was a drug addict. Michael Jackson accidentally killed Michael Jackson.’ The 60-year-old heart surgeon - released from prison three weeks ago, having served half of his four-year sentence for involuntary manslaughter – began working for Jackson in 2006. 'I loved him. I still do. I always will.': Dr Murray - seen here arriving to his trial in 2011 - continues to profess his innocence . But it was not until he went to help him prepare for his This Is It come-back tour in 2009 that he saw the devastation of his life. ‘He was in crisis at the end of his life, filled with panic and misery,’ he said. ‘By the end Michael Jackson was a broken man. I tried to protect him but instead I was brought down with him.’ Murray claims Jackson had been dragged ‘into the abyss’ of physical and mental anguish by the pressures of the tour. King of Pop: Michael Jackson, pictured in March 2009, died in June the same year of acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication following a cardiac arrest in his home Neverland . He claims he lived in a state of . paranoia and filth: maids were not even allowed to take his underwear to . be laundered because he feared they would sell it. Murray . insists he was one of the few people the superstar trusted. ‘You want . to know how close we were? I held his penis every night to fit a . catheter because he was incontinent at night.’ The doctor said Jackson’ 5’11” frame had wasted to little over nine stone, he was suffering from chills, insomnia and mood swings and he was dependent on the prescription drug propofol to help him sleep. Murray claims he had ‘weaned’ Jackson off the drug the singer called ‘milk’ only days before his death on June 25, 2009. Tragedy: Picture shown in court of Jackson¿s body in hospital during Dr Murray's trial . He believes his insomnia that night was due to withdrawal symptoms from another drug, Demerol, an analgesic better known as pethidine, which had been provided by another doctor without his knowledge. In a claim, made for the first time, Murray insists that while he was out of the room Jackson got up and injected himself with a lethal dose of propofol after Murray had refused to give him the amount he wanted. The heart surgeon claims he did everything he could to save Jackson. Whether or not you believe him, he has clearly convinced himself. He says the singer had told him shortly before his death that their names would become ‘inseparable.’ When Murray asked him what he meant ‘he smiled and said: ‘I am clairvoyant.’ Murray has filed an appeal against his conviction.","Dr Conrad Murray was convicted of killing Michael Jackson .

"Boost: David Cameron, pictured with Angela Merkel earlier this year, has been given a boost over his mission to negotiate better EU deal after the German Chancellor's party backed his plan to ban migrants sending child benefit abroad . David Cameron’s mission to negotiate a better deal for Britain in the European Union was given a boost yesterday, as Germany backed plans to ban migrants sending child benefit abroad. The Prime Minister has repeatedly vowed to clamp down on the £30million a year sent abroad to around 40,000 children whose parents live in the UK. He has made clear this will be one of his key demands during the ‘renegotiation’ he will push for if he wins the next election and delivers an in-out referendum in 2017. Yesterday German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party backed proposals which would see Germany cut its child benefit payments. MPs from her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party ‎said its level should be set according to the location of the child. They said it was wrong that Romanian seasonal workers were able to claim the German national rate of £146 a month when the equivalent rate in Romania is around £7 a month. After his defeat in trying to block Jean-Claude Juncker from being made president of the European Commission, Mr Cameron will be cheered by the prospect of Germany’s powerful support on this issue which would require changes to EU treaties. A Downing Street source said: ‘The CDU’s intervention underlines the growing support in Europe for action to tackle the abuse of free movement by those who move to claim, not to work.’ Mrs Merkel- who has not spoken to Mr Cameron about the benefits move - is also considering plans to limit the rights of EU migrants to stay in Germany if they fail to find a job, which would be a major change to the freedom of movement rules. Many Tory MPs would like to see a complete repatriation of all powers to set benefits. Andre Lindholz, Bavarian spokeswoman on migration, who are conservative allies of Mrs Merkel, told The Times on behalf of MPs from both parties: ‘Incentives for EU nationals to apply for child benefit in Germany must urgently be minimised’. The European Commission said treaty rules on free movement do not allow discrimination on child benefit between workers from different member states. Almost two-thirds of all child benefit exported from the UK is sent to Poland, according to latest figures released to Parliament .

"Beloved actor Tom Hanks’ aspiring hip-hop star son faced a barrage of ridicule this week for his use of rapper slang. Chet Haze AKA Chester Hanks got into a Twitter brawl with a former rapper named Jensen Karp starting on Sunday. The hilarious exchange between actor scion and quick-witted rapper had no official winner, but it highlighted the rift between Haze’s gangster online persona and affluent upbringing. Chester 'Chet' Hanks (left), the son of Oscar winner Tom Hanks got into an hilarious Twitter fight with comedic rapper Jensen Karp (right) that began over Hanks' liberal use of rapper slang . Fishwrapper.com points out that it all started because of a tweet that Haze, whose mother is actress Rita Wilson, wrote on November 26 about an open mic he planned to attend near LA’s Fairfax High School. ‘ima be there blessing the mic with spoken word,’ @CHETHAZE wrote. By Sunday, Karp had noticed Haze’s tweet and the comedic white former rapper aimed his sharp tongue at the music industry hopeful. ‘Your dad was in Castaway,’ joked Karp, whose Twitter handle is @JensenClan88. Roots? The feud began over this tweet that Chester, AKA Chet HAze, sent out in November about an open mic night . Blowing his top: Karp decided to remind Hanks of where he comes from and the aspiring hip-hop singer son of the Joe vs the Volcano star was none too happy . Haze was not amused. He demanded to know what his Oscar winning father had to do with anything. The Twitter war quickly heated up with Karp hitting Haze where it hurts with hilarious references to his well-off childhood in the hallowed corners of Hollywood. ‘U went to private school & talk like you're French Montana. Even saying ""swagger"" should be illegal for a kid raised in Brentwood,’ Karp wrote. Haze fought back, but his continued use of slang wasn’t helping his case. Hanks is a theater student at the prestigious Northwestern University . ‘Difference btwn me & these clowns is I will beat your a** if I see u in person. y'all are all #soft,’ Haze wrote at one point. Haze became angry enough by Monday to lash out at Karp with a cavalcade of tweets. ‘My whole life I been getting s--- from jealous nerds like you simply because I love Rap. It's f---ing hilarious. ‘My passion has nothing to do with your petty existence, so don't f---in get them twisted. Difference between me and these clowns is I actually will beat your ass if I see u in person whereas y'all are all #soft. Y'all just use the same jokes over and over again.

Funny guy: Karp, right, had a brief rapping career that ended when he departed Interscope records in 2007. His never-released album featured appearances by Kanye West, Redman, and Maya. He now runs an LA art gallery . ‘Say something original at least. I'm outta here doe. Just wanted to keep it real on these twitter nerds for once...’ More than just a ‘Twitter nerd,’ Karp is an accomplished rapper under the name Hot Karl. He was once signed to Interscope Records and according to Complex.com his never-released album featured artists Kanye West, Fabolous, Mya, Redman, and others. 'Born CRAZY RICH': Karp unleashed a barrage of jokes on Haze and questioning the authenticity of the way he speaks . He now runs a Los Angeles art gallery, manages a rapper named Nova Rockefeller, and hosts a successful podcast.

"Two women were tricked into working as prostitutes by a couple who used African black magic to frighten them into complying, a court heard today. The young women were allegedly trafficked from Nigeria into Britain  by Lizzy Idahosa, 23, and her husband Jackson Omoruyi, 41, who are accused of then terrifying them with 'juju magic' or African witchcraft. Cardiff Crown Court heard that the alleged victims, aged 23 and 29, were forced to eat snails and snakes as part of a black magic ceremony before being sent to work in brothels and massage parlours. A jury heard the women were in fear of 'illness, madness, infertility or death' if they went against the African witchcraft by refusing to have sex with strangers for money. Jackson Omoruyi, 41, and Lizzy Idahosa, 23, are accused of trafficking women to Britain to become prostitutes . And all the money they made from prostitution, which came to more than £40,000, was pocketed by Idahosa and Omoruyi, the court was told. Prosecutor Caroline Rees said: 'The couple were involved in the exploitation of two women brought into the UK from Nigeria to work as prostitutes. 'They were bound to this by something called a juju ritual. It was a ceremonial ritual used to full effect to terrify both women into doing what was demanded of them. 'It was used to ensure compliance, secrecy, and they believed if they broke the bond dire consequences would follow: illness, madness, infertility or death. 'They genuinely believed the powers would work.' Idahosa allegedly arranged for both women to travel 4,500 miles from the West African country - forcing them to go through juju ceremonies before they left. The court heard that one woman believed she was coming to the UK to find her father, but ended up trapped in 'thoroughly miserable life' having sex with up to eight men a day at brothels including the Ambassador massage parlour in Cardiff. The women were allegedly forced to work as prostitutes at this massage parlour in Cardiff . The woman, who got through border controls using fake documents, allegedly paid £45,550 to Idahosa and her husband Omoruyi. Miss Rees added: 'She was told it could be arranged for her to be brought to London but before this could happen she had to attend a juju ceremony. 'Her hair was shaved, her body was marked and her clothes were taken. She had to eat a snail and an egg as well as some dust. 'She made oaths and promises and thought she would die or go mad if she broke the oaths she had made.' The second woman was allegedly told she was going to find work in a shop with Idahosa in London. She was allowed into the UK after telling immigration officials she was a lesbian and would be sacrificed if she didn't leave Nigeria. But the court heard that when she arrived in Britain, she was also made to work in brothels and massage parlours up and down the country. She claims she felt she had 'no choice' because she had taken part in a juju ceremony. Miss Rees said: 'She was taken to see the juju man, she was given dirty water and made to eat a snake. Her body was marked, her pubic hair and brow hair was cut. 'She was told not to say anything - she believed the ritual was bonding upon her.' The women were found following an immigration raid on a massage parlour in Cardiff, while Idahosa and Omoruyi were later arrested at their home in Brockley, South London. Idahosa denies denies seven charges including trafficking for prostitution and moving criminal property, while Omoruyi denies three charges charges of inciting the women to become prostitutes and transferring criminal property. Heavily pregnant Idahosa, who has lived off benefits since 2011, claims she was also trafficked to the UK following a juju ritual. The trial continues. Cardiff Crown Court heard that Idahosa and Omoruyi used African witchcraft to force the women to comply .
