Yesterday, however, it emerged that there is more than just ideology standing between Liberal Democrat council leader Jeremy Hilton and Labour candidate Kevin Neal. Mr Hilton, 57, is believed to have left his wife to set up home with Mr Neal’s partner, who is 24 years his junior. The Lib Dem – who has twice failed to become an MP but is leader of both Gloucester city and Gloucestershire county councils – is understood to have moved out of the house he shared with his Chilean wife Polly, 53, after she found out about the affair. Left his wife: Liberal Democrat council leader Jeremy Hilton is reportedly left his wife Polly, left, after having an affair with a political rival Kevin Neal's wife . For his part, Mr Neal, who plans to stand as a Labour candidate in his local council elections, revealed that he discovered his wife Rebecca Trimnell’s infidelity after she started taking more care over her appearance. Miss Trimnell, who failed in her own bid to become a Lib Dem councillor last year, has been working for Mr Hilton for a year as a political researcher. Mr Neal, 48, said: ‘I started having suspicions about three months ago. She was buying new dresses, wearing make-up, worrying about her hair, things like that. She told me she started having feelings for him about nine months ago and it really started about three months ago.’ He and Miss Trimnell, 33, have been married for eight years and have a seven-year-old daughter. Upset: Mr Hilton has allegedly moved out of his family home to set up home with Rebecca Trimnell, left, the wife of Labour candidate Mr Neal, right . They moved from Plymouth to Gloucester last year so she could take up her job with Mr Hilton. The Hiltons have no children. Speaking last night, Mr Neal, a . horticulturalist, added: ‘I met Jeremy Hilton six or seven times and I . did not like him from the start. But it is a two-way street – my wife is . to blame too. She’s the one that cheated on me.’ Moved out: After Mr Hilton's Chilean wife Polly found out about the infidelity with Miss Trimnell, 24 years his junior, he moved out . On his website, Mr Hilton describes . his interests as ‘current affairs, swimming, travel, photography and . family’. In his council role, he once led calls to save the register . office where he married his wife, a homecare worker for the county . council, describing it as ‘a very pleasant place’ for a wedding. In his attempts to become an MP, Mr . Hilton came third in 2005 and again in 2010, when Conservative candidate . Richard Graham unseated the sitting Labour candidate. In an email address given on his . website, however, the optimistic politician still describes himself as . ‘nextmp4gloucester’, calling himself a ‘truly local candidate’ who was . born and educated in the city. When asked about his affair Mr Hilton . said: ‘I have always made a point of not commenting in public on other . people’s private matters. I don’t intend to comment on my own private . life and those involved.’ But Mr Neal said: ‘He’s in a public position and people in that position of responsibility should be able to act responsibly. ‘I do not believe politicians having . affairs is correct in this modern age. They are supposed to be setting . an example. They should lead a proper life and not destroy families.’ Mr Neal will stand as a Labour . candidate in Quedgeley, Gloucestershire, next year. Last night he said . he believed his estranged wife and Mr Hilton were staying together at a . house belonging to another Lib Dem member. Miss Trimnell said: ‘I cannot comment . as this is very much a personal and sensitive matter that needs to be . dealt with rationally, reasonably and amicably. I would hope that anyone . who has or is going through any such relationship upheaval understands . the need for privacy during this particular time.’ Mrs Hilton has not commented on her . husband’s affair. Her neighbours in Gloucester said they had not seen . her since details of the affair emerged. One said: ‘It knocked her for six. I think she’s gone away to get some peace. ‘She’s devastated, I should expect. Especially because I don’t think she kicked him out, I think he left on his own.’ Another neighbour said: ‘Polly is one of the nicest people you would like to meet.’ Face each other: Gloucestershire County Council could soon see the political rivals having to face each other after the allegations of the affair .","Leader of the Lib Dems for Gloucester County Council has allegedly left his wife for the wife of his political rival, 24 years his junior .

Former Barclays boss Bob Diamond today hit back at claims he misled MPs over the rate-rigging scandal that cost him his job. A report by MPs ruled that the banker . failed to act with ‘candour and frankness’ and gave ‘highly selective’ evidence over revelations that his bank conspired to fix interest rates. The Treasury Select Committee delivered damning verdicts on Barclays, the Bank of England, the Financial Services Authority and the Serious Fraud Office, condemning the culture of deceit in the City and the failure of its regulators to act. Former Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond gave evidence to a Treasury Select Committee in July and a new report accuses him of misleading Parliament over the Libor rate-rigging scandal . Mr Diamond resigned as Barclays chief executive last month after the bank was fined £290million for manipulating the interbank lending rate known as Libor, which affects millions of mortgages. Today, Mr Diamond said he was disappointed and strongly disagreed with several of the committee's statements. 'In particular, I strongly challenge certain assertions about my testimony,' he said. 'I answered every question that was put to me to me truthfully, candidly and based on information available to me.I categorically refute any suggestion to the contrary. 'I take particular issue with the attacks on Barclays' culture and character. Barclays, one of the only major UK financial institutions that did not need a rescue from the UK Government, is a tremendous institution with an over 300-year tradition of supporting economic growth and the communities in which we live and work. The Financial Services Authority was slammed by the select committee report, which says the FSA was two years behind its US counterparts in investigating the affair . 'I am proud of what we accomplished over . the 16 years I was employed there and our prudent management of the . institution helped avoid the fates that befell other UK banks in 2009. 'The picture being presented today of what Barclays stood for under my watch could not be further from the truth.' Mr Diamond said that the behaviour of . a small group of traders was 'reprehensible and not in keeping with . Barclays' high standards.' He . added: 'Looking forward, it's clear that thoughtful analysis and . regulation of issues affecting the banking industry are required and I . have no doubt that Barclays is committed to being part of the solution.' In an interim report on the scandal, . MPs said Mr Diamond presided over a culture at the bank where there was . ‘something deeply wrong’. His . testimony to the Treasury Committee, in which the American claimed to . be unaware of the wrongdoing until days before the fine was announced, . has been described as unconvincing. ‘Select committees are entitled to expect candour and frankness from witnesses before them,’ the MPs’ report said. ‘Mr . Diamond’s evidence, at times highly selective, fell well short of the . standard that Parliament expects, particularly from such an experienced . and senior witness.’ The . Treasury Committee said it was ‘shocking’ that the Libor corruption, . which went on between 2005 and 2009, ‘flourished for so long’. Mr . Diamond said the scandal made him ‘physically sick’ – but the select . committee has accused him and other senior managers of turning ‘a blind . eye’. It said: ‘This . attempted manipulation of Libor should not be dismissed as being only . the behaviour of a small group of rogue traders. Such behaviour would . only be possible if the management of the bank turned a blind eye to the . culture of the trading floor.’ Mr Diamond was also accused of putting up a ‘smokescreen’ by drawing attention to a conversation he had with Paul Tucker, the deputy governor of the Bank of England, in October 2008. Bank of England chief: Mervyn King . This appeared to give the impression that Mr Tucker had given the nod to Barclays to rig rates to allay fears over its financial health. While Mr Tucker has escaped serious censure, Whitehall sources said the report dents both his and FSA boss Lord Turner’s hopes of succeeding Sir Mervyn King as the Bank’s next Governor. It is good news for former Cabinet Secretary Lord O’Donnell. He is favoured by Nick Clegg, who will have a say in the selection process. A senior government source said: ‘Gus O’Donnell will be singing in his bath.’ The MPS say the FSA was two years behind U.S. authorities in launching a formal investigation into the imbroglio. And the report also accuses the Bank of England of ‘naivety’. ‘The evidence suggests that the Bank of England was aware of the incentive for banks to behave dishonestly, yet did not think that dishonesty was occurring,’ it states. ‘Nor did it appear to have asked the FSA to check to see if such dishonesty was occurring.’ The committee has called for an urgent reform at the bank, accusing regulators of arbitrarily pushing Mr Diamond out of his job. Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie said: 'Regulators should not decide the composition of boards in response to headlines... Such an informal approach as was taken in this case is open to abuse.' A Barclays spokesman said: ‘While we don’t expect to agree with every finding in [the report], we recognise that change is required . . . That is why we have established an independent review of our business practices.’ The FSA said it has ‘put in place a number of reforms in recent years, including a tougher fines policy for enforcement cases and a completely new model of bank supervision’.","'I answered every question put to me truthfully and candidly'

Sentenced: Stefan Fry, 18, inspired by the Yorkshire Ripper, has been jailed for four years, after assaulting a woman with a hammer . A teenager who was obsessed with the Yorkshire Ripper carried out copycat attacks on lone women while armed with a hammer. Stefan Fry, 18,  was jailed for four years at Dorchester Crown Court last week. The court heard he researched mass murderer Peter Sutcliffe extensively before he stalked his two victims as they walked alone in secluded parks. He crept up on 37-year-old dog walker Gemma Thompson and struck her twice on the head with a hammer. He then fled the scene, dropping the weapon along the way. Two months earlier the teenager attacked 32-year-old Maria Clarke while she walked along an alleyway. Fry punched her in the face and was beaten off when Miss Clark lashed out at him with her umbrella. He also left a hammer at the scene as he ran off. A year before the two attacks the . supermarket worker was stopped and searched by the police after a . frightened women reported that he had been following her. Fry was caught after Mrs Thompson . managed to remember part of his car registration number despite . being beaten with a hammer. In interview Fry confessed that his interest in the Yorkshire Ripper had influenced him to carry out the attacks. Detectives said there was a worrying escalation in the severity of the offences and they believe he could have gone on to kill had he not been stopped. In jailing him, judge Roger Jarvis described the attacks as ‘deeply disturbing.’ Scene of attack: A pathway in Dorchester, Dorset, where Fry's first victim, Maria Clarke, was attacked. Fry punched her in the face and was beaten off when Miss Clark lashed out at him with her umbrella . Copycat: Stefan Fry, 18, researched mass murderer Peter Sutcliffe (pictured) before the attacks . He said: 'You were plainly influenced by your fascination with serious crime, your searching on the internet for the Yorkshire Ripper and having a book on him. 'Everybody who looks at this must reach the view that you were experimenting at acting out the man’s acts.' A court heard that Fry’s first attack happened on December 15 last year in Dorchester, Dorset. Detective Chief Inspector Paul Powley, of Dorset police, said: 'She walked passed him and thought there was something not quite right. 'As she turned around he punched her in the face. She fought him off with an umbrella she was carrying otherwise it could have been a lot worse.' He said a hammer was later found hanging on a fence near the scene. On February 22 this year, Fry followed Mrs Thompson as she walked a friend’s dog in woods at Langdon Hill, Bridport. She had just put the dogs in the boot of the car when she heard Fry’s footsteps on the gravel behind her. DCI Powley said: 'She was twice struck from behind to the back of the head. Luckily she didn’t suffer serious injuries, just bruising. 'She had the presence of mind to take a registration number which we are very thankful for. 'There was an escalation of violence in her case and there is little doubt that Fry was in his infancy of his crimes. 'I think he was progressing and pushing the boundaries. Had we not caught him when we did, goodness knows what he would have gone on to do. 'He appears to have come from a normal family background but somewhere along the line he became infatuated by Peter Sutcliffe. 'The public are now protected as a result of him being put in prison. Sentenced: Fry was jailed for four years at Dorchester Crown Court last week . 'It is thanks to the courage of the victims and the tenacity of the investigative team that Fry is now serving that prison sentence.' Carolyn Branford-Wood, prosecuting, said Fry made no secret of his interest in the Yorkshire Ripper. She said: 'Asked about the use of the hammer on the two occasions he said he obtained that idea from reading books and also research on the internet about the Yorkshire Ripper. 'He thought it was a large blunt instrument that would have a visual impact on his victims.' Sutcliffe was caught after one of the most notorious murder hunts in British criminal history. It was on July 5, 1975, just 11 months after he married, that Sutcliffe first attacked a woman with a hammer. He said he believed he was on a 'mission from God' to kill prostitutes - although not all of his victims were. He became known as the Yorkshire Ripper after mutilating their bodies with a hammer, a sharpened screwdriver and a knife. Charles Gabb, defending, told Dorchester Crown Court the attacks had been a ‘desperate cry’ for attention. He said Fry had felt he had under-achieved throughout his life. He added: 'The aim was to frighten and scare, not to do anything else.' Judge Jarvis said Fry needed to receive help in prison before being released into society. He said: 'There is plainly a secretive part of your character where you keep some part of your personality hidden from those who think they know you well. 'It seems to me you need to spend a significant amount of time in custody so there is a clear understanding of your motivation and you receive all the help that is available in erasing those dangerous impulses.' Fry, from Bridport, pleaded guilty to two counts of assaults occasioning actual bodily harm and two offences of possessing an offensive weapon.","Stefan Fry, 18, researched mass murderer Peter Sutcliffe before 'acting out' the Ripper attacks .

Gold medallists will be awarded an honour if they have shown years of dedication and have used their public profile to 'give back to society'. Pictured is winner Chris Hoy after the Men's Keirin Track Cycling Final . The Mandarin in charge of selecting honours has revealed that rules limiting the number of sporting gongs will be torn up as a result of the London Olympics. Sir Bob Kerslake, the head of the civil service, has let it be known that gold medallists who deserve recognition will get rewarded in the New Year's Honours list, regardless of how many of them there are. A public row has erupted after it emerged that David Cameron ordered the rules changed earlier this year to remove the automatic right of Olympic champions to an honour. Under the new guidelines, honours will go to gold medallists who have shown years of dedication and have used their public profile to 'give back to society'. But the Cabinet Office flatly denied claims yesterday that a strict quota system would mean more senior mandarins would win knighthoods than sportsmen. Instead, senior officials made clear the rulebook will be ignored this year to ensure maximum recognition for the heroes of London 2012. Sir Bob's official spokesman told the Mail: 'The stuff set out in the report are prely guidelines. Obviously this is an Olympic year and we have seen some amazing performances. 'The whole point of the honours system is that they are given on merit. If you have a rigid quota system it destroys the entire principles of the honours system. Senior officials made it clear that the rulebook will be ignored this year to ensure maximum recognition for the heroes of London 2012. Pictured is long jump champion Greg Rutherford . There will be no restrictions on the number of sporting gongs handed out in the New Year's Honours. Gold medallist Charlotte Dujardin is pictured celebrating her individual dressage win . 'If there are more people worthy of an honour in a year like this then that will be reflected in the honours. If people deserve it they should receive it.' The spokesman stopped short of confirming that every gold medallist will get a gong, but Whitehall officials have said it is 'highly likely' that every gold medallist who does not already have an MBE or better is expected to receive one. Sir Bob Kerslake, the head of the civil service, made it clear that the rule book would be ignored following London 2012 . Sir Bob's aides intervened after the Mail revealed yesterday that both David Cameron and and Lord Coe - the mastermind of the games - also privately back the call for all gold medallists to be rewarded. The call is also backed by London Mayor Boris Johnson, four time gold medallist Sir Matthew Pinsent and Lord Moynihan, the outgoing chairman of the British Olympic Association. The BOA is expected to nominate all 43 gold Olympic gold medallists and those from the Paralympic Games, which begin next week. Senior Whitehall officials pointed out that there are likely to be at least three Olympic knights in the New Year's Honours. Bradley Wiggins, the first British winner of the Tour de France winner who won his fourth Olympic gold this year, Dave Braislford -- who masterminded Team GB and Team Sky's cycling successes - and four-time Olympic champion sailor Ben Ainslie all have CBEs already. That means the only honour they could receive is a knighthood.","Head of the civil service, Sir Bob Kerslake, said there will be no restrictions on the number of sporting gongs .

Heads dropping: Military morale is at its lowest point since 2008, according to the MoD's own survey . Morale in Britain’s Armed Forces is plummeting, the Ministry of Defence’s own survey has revealed. Crippling government cuts to the Army, Royal Navy and RAF has sparked a wave of disgruntlement, the figures show. Redundancies totaling 22,000, botched defence reviews, pay freezes and the axing of perks for service personnel have left the military at its lowest ebb since 2008. That year, troops were still in Iraq and casualties in Afghanistan were soaring. Exactly 50 per cent of 12,000 personnel questioned for the MoD’s annual Armed Forces Continuous Attitude Survey (AFCAS) reported low morale in 2012. The figure is up from 33 per cent in 2010 – when David Cameron’s Tories failed to seize power and were forced into a Coalition with the LibDems. Until then, figures had been improving in the wake of a high of 54 per cent in 2008. The number across the services reporting morale was high fell from 25 per cent in 2010 to just 15 per cent this year. Officers were especially angry - those reporting low morale soared from 32 per cent to 60 per cent over the same period. Commanders have borne the brunt of cuts to pay, pensions and perks. Nearly 60 per cent of RAF personnel questioned said morale was low, compared to 55 per cent in the Royal Navy, 45 per cent in the Army and 41 per cent in the Royal Marines. Only last month, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond admitted morale was ‘fragile’, before ploughing ahead with axing some of the most distinguished battalions – including those serving in Helmand. Concerns: Defence Secretary Philip Hammond (left) has admitted morale was 'fragile' while his Labour counterpart Jim Murphy branded the figures a 'worry' Under a controversial Coalition shake-up, the Army will be left at its weakest since 1750 while the Royal Navy and RAF are being forced to swallow cuts of 5,000 troops each plus the loss of warships, fast jet and spy planes. Shadow Defence Secretary Jim Murphy said: ‘These figures are a real worry and a terrible reflection of this Government’s defence policy. ‘A vital benchmark of success is our Forces’ morale and yet it has been damaged and dented by David Cameron and Philip Hammond. ‘A botched review and cuts to vital support have made our Forces feel under-valued and over-stretched.’ Defence Minister Peter Luff said morale would recover. He said: ‘We have had to make tough decisions to get the defence budget back into balance, including reducing the size of our armed forces. ‘Any change like this is bound to create uncertainty, but the resilience of our personnel should not be underestimated. ‘We are nearing the end of a very difficult period in defence and hope to see morale slowly recovering over the next couple of years.’","Half of 12,000 personnel questioned in MoD survey reported low morale .

The one that's responsible for this is Armando Perez,' she said, according to KPBS. Captured near downtown Tijuana, Mexico in February, after 16 months on the run, Perez was extradited back to the U.S. on condition prosecutors would not to seek the death penalty. He faces a maximum of life behind bars without parole. Admittance: Seen during an interview from prison Perez said that he lost it on the day of Ms Gonzalez's death and he acted in a way that wasn't him . In a jail-house interview with Perez, he told NBC7 that on the day of Ms Gonzalez's death he completely 'lost it' and wasn't himself, saying the murder was neither planned nor a crime of passion. 'Diana . didn't deserve this and that's why I'm here. There's no justification; I'm not . saying excuses. In my case I think the only thing I would say is that I'm . guilty. But not of first degree murder,' he said. 'I'm . sorry. I always will be sorry, no matter if I die tomorrow or whatever,' he added. 'I love . her and I always will love her. And her family, I'm real sorry.' Speaking after his arraignment on Wednesday, Ms Gonzalez's cousin Beatriz Luna read a statement prepared by family expressing their grief and hopes for full justice in her death. 'Death would be fair, but we have to leave that aspect of human life to its creator,' she said according to KPBS. 'What we do wish for this murderer is the maximum penalty, that he never sees the light of day again, just like Diana will never see it.'

Exercise and a healthy diet can both reduce a person's risk . Diabetes checks should be offered in libraries and job centres as part of a nationwide campaign to test everyone who is over 40, according to the health watchdog. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice) added that people aged over 25 who were of South Asian, Chinese, African-Caribbean or Black African descent, should have a test as they are at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. People can be assessed at their GP surgery or community pharmacy but they can also perform self assessments online. Nice . said the new recommendations will help to identify people at high risk . so they can be offered advice to help them prevent or delay the . condition. The body . said health and community services, workplaces, job centres, faith . centres, libraries and shops should offer risk assessments so they are . more widely available. If . someone is identified as high risk they should contact their GP for a . blood test to confirm the level of risk, the new Nice guidelines . suggest. Nice also recommends that people who are identified as high risk should be given an ""evidence-based, intensive lifestyle-change programme"" to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is a long-term condition that occurs when the body does not produce enough insulin for it to function properly, or when the body's cells do not use insulin properly. Diabetes currently affects almost three million people in the UK, of which about 90 per cent will have type 2 diabetes. Diabetes.co.uk says it costs around £14billion pound a year to treat diabetes and its complications. Professor Mike Kelly, director of the Centre for Public Health Excellence at Nice, said: 'Almost three million people are currently affected by diabetes, and it is likely to affect many more in the future. 'Type 2 diabetes is a very large-scale problem and it is important for people to know that it is preventable, and there are simple steps that can be taken to help reduce the risk of developing the disease. 'This guidance will help people to identify their own personal risk and highlights that by losing weight, being more active and improving their diet, they can prevent or delay type 2 diabetes.' Birmingham Community Healthcare Trust diabetes nurse consultant Jill Hill added: 'As a diabetes nurse, I have seen first-hand how the condition can affect a person's life. 'People may not be aware that diabetes is the most common cause of visual impairment and blindness, kidney failure and non-traumatic lower limb amputations. 'This guidance focuses on risk assessment and providing those at high risk with evidence-based, effective interventions that can delay or prevent this condition.' Barbara Young, chief executive of Diabetes UK, said: 'We welcome this excellent guidance document, which gives strong evidence that identifying people at high risk of type 2 diabetes is a vital part of preventing the condition and can also help diagnose those who have it earlier so that they can be helped to avoid serious complications developing. 'We want to see the recommendations in this guidance to be fully implemented because the number of people with type 2 is increasing at an alarming rate and it is only through prevention that we will be able to stem the rising tide and cost of type 2 diabetes.'","Diabetes is the most common cause of blindness, kidney failure and non-traumatic lower limb amputations .

A female nurse has been suspended after it was discovered that she had a sexual relationship with a mentally ill patient 19 years her junior. Julie Cank met the 23-year-old man at her unit at Calderstones Hospital in Whalley, Lancashire and began the relationship after he was discharged. The 42-year-old has been ordered not to work for 18 months after a fitness to practise hearing was told there was a risk of repetition. Ms Cank, of Burnley, had worked at Calderstones Hospital for 15 years and admitted that she started having intercourse with the 23-year-old after he moved from the unit to a supervised home. The man suffers from a personality disorder and was sectioned at the age of 17 after being deemed a risk to the public and to himself. In a hearing held in Manchester earlier this month, the Conduct and Competence Committee heard that the vulnerable young man also has learning difficulties and needs help with everyday chores such as cooking and dealing with finances. David Patience of the Nursing and Midwifery Council submitted a statement to the committee saying Ms Cank caused the patient harm, and was at risk of repetition. The statement said that these are serious allegations which relate to an inappropriate relationship with a vulnerable patient. The panel heard that Mr Patience submitted that Ms Canks had admitted the allegations and that her misconduct did cause actual patient harm. ‘Mr Patience further submitted that there was a real risk of repetition and, you have told the panel that you are still dealing with a health issue and these health issues have not been resolved and therefore there is a real risk of repetition. A fitness to practise hearing ruled that Ms Cank should not work as a nurse for 18 months due to the harm caused to the patient and a substantial risk of repetition (picture unrelated) ‘He said that this order should be for 18 months in order to cover any problems that may arise in the re-scheduling of this case.’ The 23-year-old man currently lives in a supported housing scheme, where he receives 30 hours of help per week. The relationship came to light when the manager of the scheme expressed concern about visits by ‘a woman in her 40s who she believed was a nurse from Calderstones’. Ms Cank told the panel that she was not currently working as a nurse, and the panel decided the suspension would not cause any financial hardship.","Julie Cank, 42, has a sexual relationship with mentally ill patient aged 23 .

Support: Mr Shapps has backed controversial proposals for a third runway at Heathrow . A Tory minister risks stoking Coalition tensions after signalling support for a third runway at Heathrow. Grant Shapps, a housing and planning minister, said Britain must consider building the runway if it is to remain a ‘great trading nation’. David Cameron promised not to build a third runway before the election in a bid to attract green voters from the Lib Dems. But in recent months the Tories have been wavering - fearing the decision could have hurt the British economy. The Lib Dems remain vociferously opposed. In an interview with The Telegraph, Mr Shapps said ‘all options’ for expanding airport capacity in the South East need to be examined to help kick-start the economy. The minister is the first to speak out publicly on the issue. Chancellor George Osborne is also thought to share this view. With the economy flatlining, business leaders are calling for either the expansion of Heathrow or for a new airport east of London. His comments raise the prospect the Tories could abandon their opposition to a third runway as part of the 2015 manifesto. Mr Shapps, an amateur pilot, said: ‘As a great trading nation we need to have sufficient numbers of ports to get people and goods in and out. ‘I back the Chancellor’s position to the hilt when he said in the Budget we clearly need to review the airport capacity in the South East. ‘All the options need to be considered while being mindful of our election manifesto.’ The minister, who is tipped for promotion in David Cameron's forthcoming reshuffle, is understood to be among a growing number of senior Tories who believe the PM should perform a public U-turn on the third runway. 'Untenable' position: It has been suggested Transport Secretary Justine Greening could be moved from her post due to her stance on the runway . Meanwhile Conservative sources have suggested Transport Secretary Justine Greening could lose her post in the planned September reshuffle because of her long-held opposition to the expansion at Heathrow. Senior party members said that, with George Osborne now in favour of the plans, Ms Greening's stance on the third runway meant she would not be able to remain in position as Transport Secretary. However the suggestion was dismissed by others who pointed out that opposing the runway was Government policy. Mr Cameron said last month that Government policy would not be changing, but Richard Wellings, head of transport at the Institute of Economic Affairs, said Ms Greening's position was 'untenable'. 'It's a problem having her as Transport Secretary with such a local interest in the issue; given her critical views on Heathrow expansion, it would make sense to replace her,' he told the Financial Times. Ms Greening came to prominence campaigning as a backbencher in her Putney constituency as one of the main opponents of the third runway. The plans for expansion were ardently opposed by people living around the airport, particularly in the village of Sipson, which would be wiped out if the plans were given the green light. Expansion: The village of Sipson, pictured above with Heathrow Airport in the background, would be built over if plans for a third runway were to go ahead . A consultation on airport capacity in the South East has twice been delayed as a result of Government infighting. Earlier this month Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London, accused the Government of 'pussy-footing around' on the issue of London's airport crisis. Housing Minister Mr Shapps also indicated in the interview that he is opposed to possible Treasury proposals to further deregulate the planning system. Sources at the Treasury have indicated that they would consider looking again at the National Planning Policy Framework, and possibly allowing building on the green belt. Mr Shapps said there is no need to build on the green belt. 'We're not short of schemes to get housing built, we just need to get out there, roll our sleeves up and get developments going,' he said. 'It's not the case that we'll never need to do another piece of planning reform. But let's concentrate on what we've got. 'We've got nearly half a million planning applications ready or nearly ready.'","Grant Shapps says Britain must consider building the runway if it is to remain a 'great trading nation'

Tummy troubles: There is increasing concern that climate change may be driving bacterial waterborne infectious diseases . Climate change could be driving an increase in illnesses such as cholera and gastroenteritis in northern Europe, scientists have warned. A rise in temperatures in the Baltic Sea has triggered the growth of the water-borne bacteria Vibrio. The bacteria, which is passed to humans by eating raw or undercooked shellfish or from exposure to seawater, can cause various infections, ranging from cholera to gastroenteritis-like symptoms. An international team examined sea surface temperature records and satellite data in the Baltic, as well as statistics on Vibrio cases in the region. The bacteria usually grow in warm and tropical marine environments, and the researchers found the number and distribution of cases in the Baltic Sea area was linked to peaks in sea surface temperatures. For each year that the temperature rose by one degree, the number of vibrio cases rose by almost 200 per cent. The study focused on the Baltic Sea in particular because it warmed at an unprecedented rate of 0.063 to 0.078 degrees Celsius a year from 1982 to 2010, or 6.3 to 7.8 degrees a century. Study author Craig Baker-Austin from the UK-based Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science, said: 'The big apparent increases that we've seen in cases during heat wave years... tend to indicate that climate change is indeed driving infections.' Climate studies suggest that rising greenhouse gas emissions made global average surface temperatures increase by about 0.17 degrees Celsius a decade from 1980 to 2010. '(It) represents, to our knowledge, the fastest warming marine ecosystem examined so far anywhere on Earth,' the paper said. Many marine bacteria thrive in warm, low-saline sea water. In addition to warming, climate change has caused more frequent and heavier rainfall, which has reduced the salt content of estuaries and coastal wetlands. Vibrio cholerae - some strains can cause cholera: Each year the temperature rose one degree, the number of vibrio cases rose almost 200 per cent . As ocean temperatures continue to rise . and coastal regions in northern regions become less saline, Vibrio . bacteria strains will appear in new areas, the scientists said. Vibrio outbreaks have also appeared in . temperate and cold regions in Chile, Peru, Israel, the northwest U.S. Pacific and northwest Spain, and these can be linked to warming . patterns, the scientists said. Rising temperatures: The Baltic Sea represents the 'fastest warming marine eco-system examined so far anywhere on earth' 'Very few studies have looked at the risk of these infections at high latitudes,' Baker-Austin said. 'Certainly the chances of getting a vibrio infection are considered to be relatively low, and more research is focused on areas where these diseases are endemic or at least more common,' he added. Previous Vibrio outbreaks in colder regions have often been put down to a sporadic event or special conditions rather than a response to long-term climate change. This is because the effects of global warming can be more pronounced at higher latitudes and in areas which lack detailed historical climate data, the study said. Writing in the journal Nature Climate . Change the authors, from Britain, Finland, Spain and the U.S., said: 'There is increasing concern regarding the role . of climate change in driving bacterial waterborne infectious diseases.' However Baker-Austin added a note of caution saying there are still 'huge data gaps in that area which need addressing.'","Vibrio bacteria, which is normally found growing in warm and tropical waters, now thrives in the Baltic Sea .

Children who are overweight or obese are up to six times more at risk of developing gallstones, warn researchers. They found that fat girls are at the highest risk from the condition. Gallstones join other supposedly adult disorders now affecting youngsters, including type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Children who are overweight or obese are up to six times more at risk of developing gallstones, warn researchers . The study found children and adolescents who were overweight were twice as likely to have gallstone disease. Those who were moderately obese were four times as likely to have gallstones and those who were extremely obese were six times as likely to have gallstones. The study was based on information in the electronic health records of more than 510,000 children ages 10 to 19, from 2007 to 2009, who were members of the health insurance plan Kaiser Permanente Southern California. Researchers found a stronger association between obesity and gallstones in girls than in boys. Girls who were obese and extremely obese were six and eight times more likely to have gallstones than girls who were underweight or of normal weight. Girls who were obese and extremely obese were six and eight times more likely to have gallstones than girls who were underweight or of normal weight, the study found . Obese and severely obese boys were more than twice and three times as likely to have gallstones than normal or underweight peers, says the study published in the Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology & Nutrition (must credit). Using oral contraceptives was also a risk factor for gallstones. Lead author Corinna Koebnick of the Kaiser Permanente Southern California Department of Research & Evaluation, said ‘Although gallstones are relatively common in obese adults, gallstones in children and adolescents have been historically rare. ‘These findings add to an alarming trend-youth who are obese or extremely obese are more likely to have diseases we normally think of as adult conditions. ‘It is a concern, prevalence of diabetes is increasing and cardiovascular risk factors. ‘This emphasises that obesity, especially extreme obesity, is not a benign condition, it’s got to be taken seriously.’ Gallstones may cause symptoms such as recurrent abdominal pain and nausea, although many people with gallstones have no symptoms. Gallstones can block the passage of bile into the intestine, which in turn can cause severe damage or infection in the gallbladder, liver, or pancreas and, if left untreated, the condition can be fatal. Obesity is a major risk factor for gallstones in adults. Dr Koebnick said the study identified 766 children who had gallstones because they were treated, probably with surgery to remove the gallbladder. She said there had been reports of clinics in the US performing more gallbladder surgery on children, with operations at one clinic in Texas going up from two to 100 a year over 40 years. She said ‘We just don’t know what the health implications are because previously gallstones in children were the result of gallbladder disease. ‘It’s still an uncommon condition in children’ she added. ‘But now we have to think that being fat is the key cause of gallstones in youngsters.’ George Longstreth, senior study author and a gastroenterologist from Kaiser Permanente San Diego Medical Center, said ‘The high rate of gallstones in obese children and adolescents may surprise paediatricians because gallstone disease is generally regarded as an adult disorder. ‘Since obesity is so common, paediatricians must learn to recognize the characteristic symptoms of gallstones.’","Overweight girls most at risk, according to a U.S. study .

"Describes seeing in the New Year in a theatre 'though perhaps not the kind of theatre I would ideally have chosen' By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 09:58 EST, 27 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 10:00 EST, 27 September 2012 . A librarian who vowed to laugh in the face of terminal cancer by writing a comedy book has lost his battle against the illness. John Blackburn, 64, was diagnosed with multiple myeloma - cancer of the bone marrow - four years ago. But the upbeat grandfather refused to be defeated by his illness so he wrote an autobiography called 'Keeping Your Sense of Tumour', which went on sale at Amazon. John with wife Su just after his eBook about his cancer battle was published on Amazon. Su said her husband was 'thoughtful and selfless' In his book, John who said he was 'a hypochondriac by profession, but a devout coward by religion,' described feeling like he was being 'marked up for target practice' as he was prepared for radiotherapy. In another entry from when he was confined to a wheelchair John wrote: 'It had become my oft-repeated claim while in hospital that I hadn’t had a ‘drink’ since Christmas but had been legless since New Year.' After completing his book, John’s bone marrow cancer was initially declared inactive by doctors and he was sent back home and could walk around the house unaided. But later tests showed the myeloma was back and John had to have more treatment. He was admitted to hospital last week after becoming poorly and his condition deteriorated suddenly. He died at Royal Preston Hospital on Saturday surrounded by his family. His wife Su of Bamber Bridge, near Preston, Lancashire said: 'I have lost a caring, thoughtful and selfless husband who faced his illness with courage and determination, but above all, his ever present sense of humour. 'As a family, we are overwhelmed by the many touching tributes we have received and we will miss John dearly.' John began suffering from twinges in his back in 2008 just as he was about to retire from his job of 43 years as a librarian for Lancashire County Council. The pain gradually worsened and John’s leg suddenly seized up. Investigations revealed he had a tumour on his spine and he was diagnosed with multiple myeloma. Su and John Blackburn on John's 60th birthday, a year before he was diagnosed with cancer. He kept his sense of tumour despite undergoing several grueling treatments . Doctors were unsure whether John would ever walk again. He spent the next five months in hospital undergoing surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. During his illness, John had to deal with pneumonia, septic shock, chest infections and a bad case of shingles. He then spent seven months in a nursing home and was unable to stand up. In the book, John speaks of the first time that he dropped the pun used for the book’s title into general conversation with his friends and family. He writes: 'The silence which followed this admittedly dreadful pun you could have cut with a knife, and the sight of jaws dropping had to be seen to be believed. 'But then a smile appeared, and then another, but at least the cries of ""Dad!” and “John!” when they arrived were accompanied by smiles.' The fun loving family man also wrote of how his regular ritual of celebrating the turn of the year at a theatre in Preston had been interrupted by his surgery. John described his experiences being treated for cancer and how doctors often used terms he didnt' understand . He joked: 'Having seen the New Year in the previous two years at a concert at the Guild Hall in Preston, we would have probably done the same again that year had it not been for my condition, yet lo and behold I was going to see 2009 in at a theatre in Preston after all, though perhaps not the kind of theatre I would ideally have chosen!' Medical procedures in hospitals are often littered with phrases that the patient does not understand, and John’s treatment was no different. John speaks about his visit to the hospital to be ‘marked up’ for radiotherapy. He said: 'I seem to remember a voice saying that it was T9 but at the time this didn’t mean anything to me. I gather now that the area where they had put the metalwork in my back covered an area something like T8-T12 so, if that makes it sound like a game of Battleships, I suppose that in a way it was!' He also speaks of himself as 'an inherently lazy person' who does not shave because 'the time he spent doing it would be far better employed staying in bed for an extra few minutes'. During his battle with multiple myeloma, he has had to deal with pneumonia, septic shock, chest infections and a bad case of shingles. He calls the after-effects of the latter condition “the Shingle Tingle”. He said of one doctor: 'He made me walk up and down the ward, then stuck his finger up my bum and sent me home. Well, I think he, I think he was a doctor, he was wearing a white coat and carrying a clipboard, but sometimes when I think about it I wonder.' He recalled coming round from anaesthetic and said: 'For some reason believing I was on the set of A Question of Sport but looking from a balcony over New York’s skyline a night.' At the time the book went on sale John said: 'Writing this book has certainly helped me with my illness. If you are scared of something, it is easier to joke about it. It is a way of escapism. 'Being a coward about anything medical, I never would have envisaged myself being able to cope with cancer, but I have done. I’m also hoping to dispel the myth that all librarians are stuffy, boring and serious. 'You can only get away with joking about cancer if you actually have it yourself.'","Mr Blackburn, was diagnosed with cancer of the bone marrow four years ago .

A mother who gave birth when she was just 24 weeks pregnant had to wait five weeks to cuddle her daughter because the baby was so small her head was the size of a satsuma. Chloe Dolby, 26, went into labour on New Years’ Eve last year when she was only just over halfway through her pregnancy term. When little Maya was born, she weighed just 1Ib 3ozs, and was kept in hospital for almost five months. 'Miracle': Baby Maya Dolby was born four months premature on New Year's Eve last year and was so small that her head was the size of a satsuma . 'Miracle': Parents Chloe and David Dolby hold baby Maya. At birth, her head was the size of a satsuma and her grandmother knitted her a tiny hat . Maya’s head was the size of a satsuma and her hand barely covered the surface of her father David’s fingernail. Mrs Dolby, from Mirfield, West Yorkshire, said: 'She was absolutely tiny. The hardest part was not being allowed to pick her up and cuddle - I had to wait five-and-a-half weeks to do that. 'We were allowed to touch her through the incubator but I was always worried I would pass something on to her.' Mrs Dolby’s grandmother, Rhonda Bruce, 77, knitted a tiny hat for Maya as no clothing available to buy would fit her. When . the mother-to-be had a mild stomach ache on December 31, she thought it . was something she had eaten, and did not imagine she was about to meet . her daughter. Big smile: Maya is now eight months old and is living with her parents after five months in hospital . But, within just two hours, Mrs Dolby was at Dewsbury and District Hospital in labour, hoping her new arrival would survive. She said: 'When I first went into labour, it never entered my head she might come early. 'David and I didn’t say anything to each other about what could happen to our baby but we were both terrified. 'We both knew what the odds were that she wouldn’t survive but we just tried to stay positive. The doctors were really calm and reassuring - I presume because they wanted to stop me from worrying. 'When Maya was born, she was taken away straight away and worked on by the team. She was just so tiny. I just held my husband’s hand and prayed.' Maya was given a blood transfusion - . one of nine she had in four months, and it is thanks to the quick and . skilled delivery team at Dewsbury and District Hospital that Maya is alive today. She was then moved straight to Leeds General Infirmary (LGI) for more specialised care. Mr Dolby, a 31-year-old plumber, said: 'I went in the ambulance with Maya to LGI. 'Doctors were working on her right through the journey - the longest of my life. 'It . was surreal seeing everyone out on New Years’ Eve dressed up and having . a good time, and I was in an ambulance pleading for our little girl to . be OK. 'We were lucky to . get a place at LGI but we are so grateful we did - the medical staff . there were incredible, what could have happened without them isn’t worth . thinking about.' While at LGI, Maya was given heart surgery to close a valve and allow more blood to flow properly, giving her more oxygen. She also had laser eye surgery to save her sight as the blood vessels in her eyes were not properly developed. Mrs . Dolby said: 'Despite Maya having to go through all the operations and . transfusions, we were more worried we would be told she had caught an . infection. 'So many babies . look like they’re getting there and then they pick up an infection and . they don’t survive. It was just a terrifying time.' Proud: Grandmother Rhonda Bruce with the bonnet she knitted for Maya . Worrying times: Mr Dolby holds tiny Maya shortly after she was born . Bonding: Mrs Dolby gave birth at 24 weeks just hours after she started to suffer a mild stomach ache . Maya was discharged from hospital on April 9 - ten days before Mrs Dolby’s original due date - something rarely heard of in cases of such premature babies. Mrs Dolby said: 'It was such a relief to bring Maya home - it was such an intense environment on the ward. I would find myself just sitting and looking at the monitors, it was so stressful.' The proud parents would visit their tiny daughter twice each day to give her the encouragement to get better. Mr Dolby said: 'Our families were amazing throughout the whole time we were in hospital with Maya. Our parents would go in and siblings. Maya definitely knew how much she was loved. 'It took it out of all of us - we just didn’t know what to expect. I think our families found it hard because it was such a scary environment.' But eight-month-old Maya is now back at home and out of the woods. Mrs Dolby said: 'I looked after her in hospital but we had to be careful when she first came out because she was still vulnerable. 'We hadn’t bought any stuff so we had to go out and buy everything in about a week. 'It feels good to have her with me all the time and be able to treat her like a normal baby. 'She’s our little miracle.'","Chloe Dolby, 26, went into labour when she was just 24 weeks pregnant .

"Journalist Charles Horman and student Frank Teruggi disappeared in 1973 . By . Associated Press . UPDATED: . 03:58 EST, 1 December 2011 . A judge in Chile is seeking the extradition of a former U.S. military officer for involvement in the disappearance and murder of two Americans during the coup that brought the dictator General Pinochet to power. Charles Horman, a freelance journalist, and student Frank Teruggi went missing during the struggle and allegations of U.S. complicity in their death inspired an Oscar-winning movie. Judge Jorge Zepeda has now asked Chile's Supreme Court to demand the extradition of Captain Ray E. Davis, who was commander of the U.S. military mission in Chile at the time, to be tried for the 1973 killings. Iron rule: More than 3,000 people disappeared or were killed under the regime of General Pinochet in Chile . Retired Chilean army . Brigadier Pedro Espinoza Bravo was also being charged for the murders. Davis was the commander of the U.S. military mission at the time of the coup that toppled socialist President Salvador Allende, working as a liaison between the U.S. and Chilean militaries. His current whereabouts were not immediately clear. Espinoza is jailed in a special Chilean prison for offenders convicted of human rights abuses. Mr Horman's widow Joyce told Associated Press: 'I'm stunned. I'm so glad for this step forward.' The U.S. Embassy in Chile released a statement saying that as a matter of policy the State Department does not comment on specific extradition matters. It read: 'The U.S. government . continues to support a thorough investigation into the Horman and . Teruggi deaths in order to bring those responsible to justice.' The . search for Charles Horman, who disappeared two weeks after the coup, by . his wife and his father, Ed Horman, was the topic of the 1982 movie . Missing, which starred Sissy Spacek and Jack Lemmon. The film won a best . screenplay Oscar. Spotlight: The search for journalist Charles Horman, who disappeared in Chile in 1973, was the subject of an Oscar winning film The Missing starring Jack Lemmon and Sissy Spacek . The film suggested American complicity in Horman's death and drew vigorous objections from U.S. State Department officials at the time. The case remained almost ignored in Chile until 2000, when Joyce Horman went to Chile and filed a lawsuit against Pinochet. She said she was acting on behalf of all victims of Chile's dictatorship. A national commission has determined that 3,095 people were killed or disappeared. Mrs Horman, who lives in New York, said: 'We always thought that Chile's military would look to an American official before they killed an American.' According to court papers, Mr Horman, a freelance journalist and filmmaker, was arrested on September 17, 1973, shortly after the coup. He was believed to have been taken to Santiago's main soccer stadium, which had been turned into a detention camp for Pinochet's suspected opponents. He was 31 years old at the time. A national truth commission said Mr Horman was executed the next day while in the custody of state security agents. It also said Mr Teruggi, a 24-year-old university student, was executed several days later, on September 22. In the indictment, Judge Zepeda alleged that the killings of Mr Horman and Mr Teruggi occurred during a secret investigation by U.S. officials into the activity of Americans at home and in Chile, 'activity that U.S. agents considered ''subversive'''. The judge said the American journalist was considered a subversive for his work as a screenwriter for the Chilean state film company during Allende's government. The judge alleged that Captain Davis could have stopped Horman's execution but didn't because he considered his work 'subversive and extremist'. He also said that said the journalist may have also been killed because he inadvertently found out about U.S. 'collaboration during the military events unfolding' in Chile's military coup. A previously classified State Department memorandum from 1976, released in 1999, stated: 'U.S. Intelligence may have played an unfortunate part in Horman's death. 'At best, it was limited to providing or confirming information that helped motivate his murder by the GOC (Government of Chile). 'At worst, U.S. Intelligence was aware the GOC saw Horman in a rather serious light and U.S. officials did nothing to discourage the logical outcome of GOC paranoia.' Peter Kornbluh, who heads the Chile documentation project at the Washington-based National Security Archive, said: 'After 38 years of waiting at least the wheels of justice are turning in Chile; the legacy of U.S. involvement is obviously a factor in this case.' Both Teruggi and Horman were monitored by U.S. agents in Chile, Judge Zepeda said, adding that the information gathered was passed on to Chilean intelligence officials who ordered the men's detentions. The whereabouts of former Captain Davis, who would now be in his mid-80s, were unclear. But in a February 13, 2000, article, The New York Times quoted him as saying that he had nothing to do with the deaths. He said Teruggi and Horman were 'down there handing out pamphlets against the government'.",Journalist Charles Horman and student Frank Teruggi disappeared in 1973 .

"By . Jill Reilly . PUBLISHED: . 07:39 EST, 20 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:31 EST, 20 March 2012 . Dutch MPs will today call for an investigation into the case of young men under the age of 21 allegedly castrated in the 1950s by the Roman Catholic Church 'to get rid of homosexuality.' The government will come under pressure to probe what some claim is a cover-up of a scandal which saw boys' testicles removed if they dared report abuse by the clergy. MPs will raise the issue after a Dutch newspaper revealed details of the punishments - which had not been exposed by an official investigation into sexual abuse within the Church published last year. The NRC Handelsblad, a daily evening paper in the Netherlands, identified a man called Henk Heithuis, as one of the young men who were castrated as well as nine other minors. Revealed: The NRC Handelsblad, a daily evening newspaper in the Netherlands, newspaper identified a man Henk Heithuis as one of the young men who were castrated as well as nine other minors . After reporting two monks to the police for abusing him in a Catholic boarding home, he was surgically castrated in 1956, when he was still a minor. Cornelius Rogge, 79, a well-known Dutch sculptor who knew Mr Heithuis witnessed the phyiscal evidence of the castration. 'We . once asked Henk to drop his pants when the women were gone. He did . that. He was maimed totally. It was a huge shock,' he said reported The . Telegraph. There are also allegations that Vic Marijnen, who was a Dutch Prime Minister had links to the case. In 1956, he was the chairman of the Gelderland children's home where Mr Heithuis and other children were abused . Joep Dohmen, an investigative journalist who investigated the Heithuis case, says sources told him that the surgical removal of testicles was regarded as a treatment for homosexuality and also as a punishment for those who accused clergy of sexual abuse. Mr Heithuis was castrated at the age of 20 - in 1956 he had accused Catholic clergy of sexually abusing him in his Church run care home. Children in institutional care, regardless of religious affiliation, in the Netherlands were at substantial risk of being abused during the period, the molestation rate was 20 per cent, twice that of elsewhere. Although the monks were convicted of the abuses, Mr Heithuis was still transported to a Catholic psychiatric hospital, and underwent a surgical castration. Court papers confirm he was castrated 'at his own request', but there is not a submission of his written consent. Mr Heithuis died two years after the castration in a car crash, but Mr Rogge felt compelled to report the castration to an official inquiry into abuse within the Catholic Church. The investigation headed by Wim Deetman, a former Dutch minister, received 1,800 reports of sexual abuse by clergy or volunteers within Dutch Catholic dioceses in the period since 1945. Horrifying: Harreveld, a former boarding school in the Netherlands, where Mr Heithuis suffered the abuse in the 1950s . The Deetman inquiry received Mr Rogge's report, but said 'there were few leads for further research,' so decided not to investigate. The inquiry revealed that eight hundred Catholic clergy and church employees were guilty of abusing children over 40 years. The newspaper investigation also revealed that government inspectors were aware that young men were being castrated while in Catholic-run psychiatric institutions. Minutes of meetings held in the 1950s show that inspectors were present when castrations were discussed and that the Catholic staff did not think parents needed to be involved, even if the patients were minors. There are also allegations that Vic Marijnen, who was a Dutch Prime Minister from 1963-65, had links to the case. Not only was he a rising star in his political party, he was also vice-chairman of the Dutch Catholic child protection agency,. Most importantly, in 1956, he was the chairman of the Gelderland children's home where Mr Heithuis and other children were abused. He intervened to have prison sentences dropped against several priests convicted of abusing children. The commission said it did not report on the actions of Vic Marijnen because 'the case was unmistakeably tied to circumstances which could be traced back to an individual person.' Speaking of his findings Mr Dohmen said the cases could 'no longer be traced.' 'There will be many more. But the question is whether those boys, now old men, will want to tell their story,' he added. Today Dutch MPs are going to call for a parliamentary investigation into the allegations. 'I am shocked that boys were being castrated in the 1950s,' said Khadija Arib, a Labour MP. 'I want an independent investigation. We must find out how many cases there were, who knew about it and why the government did not act.'","Surgical removal of testicles was also a punishment for .

Mirlande Wilson showed a reporter the copies of the pooled tickets she shared with her McDonald's employees and said the winning ticket was not among them - though would not say where it was . Ms Wilson told NBC she gave all of her coworkers the copies of the tickets for the pool and the winning ticket was not among them. Instead she claims to have sent a friend to buy more tickets later that day and the winning one was among them. 'McDonald's don't have nothing to do . with this,' she insisted.

Tormentor: Michael Hayward has been jailed for 14 months for his decade-long campaign of harassment . A neighbour from hell has been jailed after he spent a decade ordering hundreds of unwanted taxis, takeaways and two tons of coal to the homes of his victims. Paul Hayward’s campaign of harassment saw him throw mud, food and rubbish into their gardens and plague them with more than 150 silent phone calls. His former neighbours spoke of their relief as he was sentenced to 14 months in prison after he breached an anti-social behaviour order on 19 occasions. Patricia Jones and Jim and Jill Thomas told Newport Crown Court how the 49-year-old father of two made their lives a misery. Hayward’s house in Machen, South Wales, was sold last month, marking the end of his neighbours’ ordeal. Ms . Jones, 67, said: ‘It was ten years of hell. We couldn’t relax, we were . constantly waiting and thinking “what is he going to do next?” ‘Now he has gone, we are no longer thinking “is it because he’s spying on us?” when it’s quiet.’ She looked after Hayward’s two children when he moved in ten years ago and believes the problems started after she was unable to continue. He began banging and scratching her walls, she said, throwing stones on her roof and constantly watching her. Ms Jones said: ‘It wasn’t one week here, one week there - it was constant.’ She also believes he was behind more than 100 unwanted taxis and Chinese meals being ordered to her house over a ten-year period. Mr Thomas, 71, and Mrs Thomas, 65, said Hayward began picking on their 43-year-old daughter Rachel - who suffers from cerebral palsy - using his car and wheelie bin to block her access. He would play loud music and bombard them with abuse, they added. Unnerving: Hayward made more than 150 silent phone calls to neighbours, including 100 in one day (posed by model) Mr Thomas said Hayward also threw mud, eggs, stones and food at their property and installed cameras and mirrors in his garden so he could watch them. He added: ‘Now he’s gone, we can at last have a family life here.’ On Friday Hayward was given 12 months for making persistent silent phone calls to the Thomases - with the court hearing 100 of these were made over a 24-hour period last December. He was sentenced to a further four months, to run concurrently, for ordering two tons of coal and a taxi to Ms Jones’ address in January, and two months for making hoax calls to Gwent Police last November, to run consecutively. In mitigation, Hayward’s counsel Jeff Jones said his client wanted to cause stress to his victims, not fear, and has made a fresh start since moving to a different address. The offences amount to a total of 19 breaches of an ASBO imposed in July 2007, preventing Hayward from obstructing his neighbours, assaulting or threatening them or using abusive language. He has been jailed for previous breaches. Sentencing Hayward, Judge David Morris said he had caused stress to his neighbours. He added: ‘[The calls to police] were extremely irritating and they took up time on the public telephone network which might have been used by those who had a real difficulty for which they were seeking assistance.’","Paul Hayward pelted another house with eggs and stones and made 100 silent phone calls in a day .

After motorists pulled into a garage, a man would emerge from a tiny kiosk, ask how many gallons were required and then proceed to ‘fill her up’. Today, the drive for profits means they have been phased out and garages have become the 24-hour self-service forecourts we all know. But in a remarkable turnaround, Shell is to reintroduce forecourt attendants at more than 300 of its sites by the end of the summer. The company, which has almost 1,000 petrol stations nationwide, believes that offering free, customer-friendly service to motorists will encourage loyalty . Faced with cut-price competition from supermarkets, the company, which has almost 1,000 petrol stations nationwide, believes that offering free, customer-friendly service to motorists will encourage loyalty. And in a throwback to a golden age of motoring, Shell’s AA-trained staff will offer basic car maintenance, such as checking tyres, as well as handling the petrol pump. The service could prove popular with female motorists who have  little knowledge of – or inclination  to carry out – routine maintenance such as checking tyre pressures and topping up oil levels. ‘When we had a shift away from the old-style garage to modern petrol stations, it became all about keeping customers on the move, getting them in and out as quickly as possible,’ said Melanie Lane, Shell’s retail general manager. ‘Today’s motorists spend between £50 and £100 to fill up their vehicles and are increasingly time-poor, so they’d much rather be somewhere else than standing on a forecourt pumping petrol. To drivers of a certain age, they are remembered fondly. After motorists pulled into a garage, a man would emerge from a tiny kiosk, ask how many gallons were required and then proceed to ¿fill her up¿ . ‘Our way means they can go inside while their tank is filled, buy a few bits and pieces and their fuel bill will be delivered to them at the kiosk, so there won’t be any slowing down of forecourt traffic.’ For many British drivers, their only experience of pump attendants is abroad, where it is often unclear whether they are being charged extra for the service or are expected to offer a tip. Many American filling stations charge a premium for ‘full service’, but Shell insists this will not apply to its new initiative. ‘The attendants will be easily  recognisable in bright red uniforms with high-visibility stripes,’ Ms  Lane added. ‘There will be a sign outside to say there’s an attendant on duty – there will always be one attendant on hand during six to eight daylight hours, seven days a week. ‘They are a broad mix of age,  gender and ethnicity and we plan to roll out this service to 600 locations by mid-2013.’ The move was applauded by motoring groups. Edmund King, president of the AA, said: ‘In today’s world of anonymous forecourts, putting someone there to help must be a welcome development. 'It may also make solo women drivers feel safer having a human presence among the pumps. ‘A fair proportion of drivers don’t know how to check tyre pressures and fluid levels. For that category of driver, an attendant on duty will be extremely helpful.’","Shell says the service will save precious  time for busy motorists .

Suspect: Isaiah Sweet, 17, was arrested on Monday and charged with two counts of first-degree murder in the death of his grandparents . The grandson of an elderly couple who were found slain at their home over the weekend has been arrested and charged with their murders after he allegedly told friends he hated them and wanted to kill them. Police captured Isaiah Sweet, 17,  from Iowa, in Cedar Rapids after a short chase on Monday. They had been looking for him since they found the bodies of Richard Sweet, 55, and Janet Sweet, 62, in their Manchester home on Sunday after relatives arrived for Mother's Day celebrations. Police believe they were murdered on Friday. Since then, the teen used his Twitter page to post a number of cryptic messages which police believe are about the murders. They included: 'Time to live my life', 'I'm f***ed up, torn down, I'm twisted, doorknob', and 'My phone is as big as hell right now'. The teen was charged with two counts of first-degree murder in the death of his grandparents, who he lived with. After he was arrested the tweets continued on his alleged Twitter page, where he uses the pseudonym Isweet37. They said: 'You drunk c*** f***ing snitch', 'Damn. Cant wait to get outa the cop shop' and 'All youve done the past 30 minutes is sit in a corner and text? #Retardcop'. Shackled and in orange prison uniform, the 17-year-old remained silent throughout most of his initial courtroom appearance this afternoon. He is being held on $1million bond. He also faces a charge of operating a motor vehicle without the owner’s consent. According to a Delaware County criminal complaint, in the hours following the death of his grandparents, Sweet discussed the killings with several friends, and told a few that he was 'on the run'. According to the Telegraph Herald Sweet allegedly told one witness, Darrian Marie Fleischacker, that he drugged his grandparents and thought they were dead as he was unable to locate a pulse. Autopsies were performed on Monday but authorities have not released the cause of death. In chains: Sheriff officers lead a shackled Isaiah Sweet into the Clayton County Courthouse yesterday for his first appearance. He is being held on $1million bond . Tweets: Isaiah's alleged Twitter profile had a flurry of activity over the weekend and on Friday, at the time his grandparents were murdered, he posted 'Time to live my life' A close friend told The Des Moines Register that the teen hated his grandparents and would often say he wanted to kill them. She described their relationship as 'contentious'. Jade Offerman said: 'He never got along with his grandparents. He absolutely — he hated them.

She said the believed the grandparents, particularly the grandfather, were sometimes strict with the teen but didn't believe anything he said about wanting to kill them. 'I never took him seriously. He’d be like, ""I hate them so much. I’m going to kill them"". But obviously you hate your parents sometimes and you say stuff like that,' she said. 'Nobody takes you seriously.' Last Saturday night, Sweet drove Miss Offerman and some friends to a party at an apartment in downtown Iowa City in a truck which is believed to have belonged to the elderly couple. One of the passengers, Kelli Fisher, 19, said Sweet had drugs in the vehicle including marijuana and prescription painkillers. The labels were scratched off on the bottles, said Miss Fisher, and she noticed he was 'visibly shaking' and carrying a knife. Facebook profile picture: Isaiah Sweet with a friend making rude gestures to the camera . She told The Des Moines Register: 'He showed us a knife that he had just bought, which was really weird…It was smaller, but it had very, very jaggedly edges.' Miss Offerman said Sweet called her on Sunday and acted very strange and secretive but said it sounded like a goodbye call after he said to her: 'I love you. I miss you. You’re never going to see me again.' The accused murderer allegedly told at least three people that he had drugged his grandparents and killed them, according to court records. Richard and Janet Sweet were said to be facing financial difficulties and Mr sweet faced a first-degree theft charge for allegedly taking $10,000 from the trust for Marie Ann Sweet, his mother.

Distraught Sophie Roorda, now 11, never quite came to terms with losing her three-year-old little black and white terrier, even with the passing years. And to her utter amazement, she has been reunited with her beloved Tessa after the pet was discovered wandering in the wilderness near the family home in Barnhart, St Louis. Reunited: Sophie Roorda has been reunited with her dog Tessa after four years thanks to an implanted identification chip . A family spotted the stray animal looking thin and disheveled and took her to a nearby animal sanctuary. Staff at Webster Groves Animal Hospital found a microchip with her owner's contact information. Sophie’s father Jeff Roorda, picked up the dog last week, told stltoday.com: ‘She came right to me when I called her name. She seemed pretty happy to see me. ‘It would be fascinating to find out how she got from Barnhart to Webster Groves and what happened in the last four years.’ Angel Venegoni, the animal hospital's administrator said her hospital regularly reunites microchipped pets with owners, but four years could be a record for them. Sophie’s parents had tried to fill the void left by missing Tessa and bought the sixth-grader a cat, Jayda, and a Shih Tzu named Jazzie. Nancy Roorda said: ‘We got her to replace Tessa. At that time, my father and Sophie's great-grandmother had passed away and then the dog disappeared, so it was a really rough time for her.’ And a month ago her treasured cat also went missing. Its remains were discovered near a coyote den near their home, which appeared to confirm the theory that the same fate had befallen Tessa. That was until they received a call from the animal hospital saying their pet had not in fact been eaten by wild dogs. Reunited Tessa has not struggled getting reacquainted with her old domestic life, climbing in to her favourite arm of the family's couch as if no time had passed.","Sophie Roorda, now 11, was left distraught when the terrier mix vanished .

Brutal Syrian dictator Bashar Assad and his British-born wife Asma may be offered 'immunity from prosecution' if it resulted in the end of his regime, diplomats have claimed. The staggering suggestion would, in effect, 'forgive' the man responsible for the deaths of more than 14,000 citizens as he viciously cracked down on a 15-month uprising. Assad's troops have been blamed in recent weeks for the massacres of hundreds of women and children. Amnesty International said he is guilty of 'crimes against humanity'. GRAPHIC CONTENT WARNING... Saved? Syrian President Bashar Assad and British wife Asma could be offered immunity from prosecution if it paves the way for him to leave power . Killed: Severely disabled Abdullah, left, and twins Ghias, centre, and Firas right were all slaughtered in Houla . But U.S. and British diplomats said the move, to protect him from prosecution by the International Criminal Court, may be the only way to end the bloody conflict. The United Nations last week said the country is descending into civil war. It would also mean Assad could not be put on trial for war crimes, genocide or crimes against humanity - and could allow him to flee to another country, possibly Russia or Iran. Officials said they wanted to offer Syria's First Couple safe passage to a conference in Switzerland, which could be held as early as next week. Anger: Britain and France have condemned the attack on children and pointed the fingers at Syrian troops . Terrible aftermath: A heartbreaking image of children said to have been killed in Houla by Assad's thugs . A Syrian MiG 21 fighter jet landed in Jordan today in the first defection involving an aircraft since the start of the uprising. 'The plane landed at King Hussein Airbase at 11am,' a Jordanian security source said. It is a military airport 50 miles northeast of the capital Amman. Syrian state television said communication was lost with a plane of the same model at 10.34am. They said it was on a training mission near the southern border with Jordan. Syrian regime and opposition leaders, . the five permanent UN Security Council members and key regional powers . such as Turkey and Saudi Arabia would also be invited. It . would focus on UN-Arab League special envoy Kofi Annan's six-point . peace-plan, which called for a 'Syrian-led political process'. They would talk about how to model Assad's exit to that of Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh in February. This would end in Assad leaving power and create a timetable of 18 to 24 months to establish a new government. Free elections would eventually be held. The proposal, diplomats claimed, came after Barack Obama and David Cameron met individually with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G20 in Mexico. Officials from both the U.S. and Britain said they were convinced after the meetings with Putin that he was not 'wedded' to Assad remaining in power indefinitely. International attention: UN observers view bodies at a hospital morgue before the burial of the Houla dead . Outrage: Mourners attend a mass burial in Syria for more than 100 people, half of whom were children, killed in a massacre in the city of Houla last month . A senior British official told the Guardian: 'Those of us who had bilaterals thought there was just enough out of those meetings to make it worth pursuing the objective of negotiating a transitional process in Syria. 'It is hard to see a negotiated solution in which one of the participants would be willing voluntarily to go off to the International Criminal Court.' Saleh was granted immunity in February, despite the massacre of civilians during a popular uprising against his regime. His Vice President Abdu Rabbo Mansour Hadi, to whom he ceded power, is drawing up a new Constitution. Today, the International Committee of the Red Cross said it would try to evacuate wounded and sick civilians and those who want to leave rebel-held areas in the embattled central Syrian city of Homs. Red Cross spokesman Rabab al-Rifai said that in addition to the planned evacuations, the ICRC will also distribute humanitarian goods such as medical kits in the neighborhoods that have endured shelling and clashes for the past 10 days. Activists said the shelling in Homs continued today, killing two people. Wounded: A Syrian girl in the town of Dael is treated after being injured in cross-fire . Tragic: The body of a child who was killed during the unrest in Daraa (left) and two dead children in Dael (right) Homs, Syria's third largest city, has been one of the hardest hit regions since the uprising against President Bashar Assad's regime began 15 months ago. Rebels control several neighborhoods, which government troops have attacked intensely over the past two weeks. Activists said conditions in the areas under siege are growing more dire by the day. In some parts, there is barely any electricity or running water, telephone lines are unreliable and residents are forced to hide in shelters during daily shelling. The International Committee of the Red Cross called on Syria's government and rebel groups yesterday to allow it to reach trapped civilians and evacuate the wounded and sick. Khaled Erksoussi, head of the Syrian Arab Red Crescent's emergency operations, said Syrian authorities have approved the operation, which is supposed to begin later today. 'Hundreds of civilians are stuck in the old city of Homs, unable to leave and find refuge in safer areas, because of the ongoing armed confrontations,' said the ICRC's head of operations for the region, Beatrice Megevand-Roggo. Activists: Syrian anti-regime fighters and citizens take a man from a pick-up truck who was wounded during the shelling by government forces in the city of Qusayr . Among the hundreds of civilians besieged in the neighborhoods are about 90 Christians. The Christians, who are trapped in Homs' Hamidiyeh and Bustan Diwan neighborhoods, include four children under the age of 10. Three attempts to evacuate the neighborhoods' Christians over the past 10 days did not succeed and a priest in the city said the rebels appear to want to keep the civilians inside to use them in the future as a bargaining chip. Thousands of Christians have fled Hamidiyeh and Bustan Diwan after they fell in rebel hands in February. Christians, who make up about 10 per cent of Syria's population, say they are particularly vulnerable to the violence sweeping the country of 22 million people. Destruction: A neighbourhood targeted by shelling . They are fearful that Syria will become another Iraq, with Christians caught in the crossfire between rival Islamic groups. In other violence around Syria, activists said government troops shelling of the southern town of Inkhil killed at least nine people and wounded many others. The Local Coordination Committees and the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said shells hit residential buildings in the town. The LCC said 13 were killed, while the Observatory put the death toll at nine adding: 'There are reports of other martyrs who are still under the rubble.' Inkhil is in the southern province of Daraa, where the uprising began in March last year.

When it comes to shopping around for their favourite snacks, youngsters of today are spoiled for choice. Thanks to the rise of the internet and social media, they are bombarded daily with advertising from new and upcoming brands keen for their cash. But a new report has revealed that despite the many different and new temptations on offer, young Britons like nothing better than a traditional biscuit. Popular: A new report has revealed that despite the many different and new temptations on offer, young Britons like nothing better than a traditional biscuit, such as a custard cream, pictured . What's your favourite type of biscuit? Classic favourites like custard creams and bourbons are top of the list with young Britons who enjoy a traditional indulgent treat just as much as older generations. Rather than choosing new and innovative biscuits a new report out today has revealed that 16-24-year olds are more likely to opt for the brands popular when granny’s biscuit tin was being passed around. Those in their teens and twenties have the biggest appetite for traditional British biscuits - with six in ten of them disagreeing that traditional biscuits are boring, compared to 55 per cent of their older counterparts aged 55 plus. The new research was carried out by  market research analysts Mintel. Its senior food and drink analyst Alex . Beckett said: 'The youth of Britain is growing up immersed in digital . media, text-speak and cutting-edge gadgetry but this doesn’t mean they . don’t appreciate a good old-fashioned Custard Cream. 'They . may lack TV support or big-name brands, but the humble Bourbon, Malted . Milk and Custard Cream are cherished by teens and students. Interesting: Youngsters in their teens and twenties have the biggest appetite for traditional British biscuits such as Bourbon and Custard Cream - with six in ten of them disagreeing that traditional biscuits are boring . 'Maybe . the lack of try-hard advertising appeals to them - or maybe these . biscuits are just better value than the increasingly chocolate-laden new . launches. Either way, the youth of austerity Britain has respect for . our biscuit heritage.' It's not for lack of choice that consumers are turning to classic biscuits - as innovation in the UK biscuit market has never been higher. Launches more than doubled in the UK between 2007 and 2011, rising to over 300 in the past 12 months. Furthermore, it is mainly younger consumers seeking solace in a biscuit as the majority (70 per cent) of 16-24 year-olds would opt for biscuits as an indulgent treat, compared to 62 per cent of the over 55s. Mature consumers, however, are far more likely to keep the time-honoured tradition of dunking alive - only 46 per cent of younger consumers (16-24) enjoy a biscuit with a hot drink as opposed to 63 per cent of the over 45s. The survey of 1,500 people showed that an increasing number of Brits can’t keep their hands from the cookie jar - with 86 per cent of Brits in 2011 eating sweet biscuits compared to 83 per cent in 2010. Today, 15 per cent of Brits confess to eating sweet biscuits once a day or more and nearly half (47 per cent) admit they like to treat themselves with foods that are not good for them. Worried: Almost half of all women say they feel guilty about eating biscuits . And when it comes to eating occasions, it seems biscuits are seen as a good way to help productivity, with nearly two in five (38 per cent) Brits munching on them at work or college or university, rising to 58 per cent users in full-time education. But despite Britain’s biscuit love - there is one thing casting a shadow across the popularity of the biscuit - the guilt factor. Overall, nearly two fifths (36 per cent) of biscuit eaters say they feel guilty about eating biscuits, a figure that rises to almost half (46 per cent) of all women. A strong demand for healthier biscuit options is also reflected in the fact that 40 per cent of consumers admit they would eat more if they were lower in sugar. Mr Beckett added: 'Women have rather a conflicted relationship with biscuits. They are more likely than men to indulge in them as a treat, but are then far more likely to feel guilty about it. 'Unfortunately, the healthy biscuits that are on the market are tarnished with a bland reputation, making that chocolate biscuit all the more tempting.' Indeed, healthy issues can represent the battleground for the biscuit industry, as two in five consumers believe that there aren’t enough of these available - but at the same time almost half (48 per cent) of consumers think low-fat and healthy biscuits taste 'bland'. In 2011, no additives or preservatives was the most used health claim for new products, accounting for a quarter of new product launches in the UK’s sweet biscuit sector. And it is Scottish consumers who eat the most sweet biscuits, with 20 per cent of consumers in that region eating them once a day or more. They are closely followed by those in the North of England with 19 per cent, 16 per cent in Wales, Yorkshire and Humberside, 15 per cent in the South West, 14 per cent in the South East and Anglia, 13 per cent in the East and West Midlands. While 12 per cent of Londoners and those in the North West have biscuits every day. In terms of value, total retail value sales climbed by a sweet 26 per cent since 2006 to reach £1.4 billion in 2011. And it appears the sector has unwrapped success for the future too, as Mintel expects it to grow a further 21 per cent to reach £1.7 billion by 2016. But it is the appeal of everyday biscuits, or plain biscuits, such as digestives, that have boosted the fortunes of the market, with sales value up 14 per cent in just one year (2010-11), with children’s biscuits also doing well with sales value up 8 per cent over the same period to reach a market value of £143 million in 2011. Conversely biscuit bundle packs have suffered, with value sales down 14 per cent over the past year to a value of £6 million in 2011.","Report reveals young Britons enjoy a traditional indulgent treat just as much as older generations .

Disgraced former Penn State football coach Jerry Sandusky may be able to hang on to his tax-payer funded pension, despite his conviction on dozens of child sex charges. Sandusky reportedly rakes in about $59,000 in pension funds annually - on top of a $148,000 lump-sum payment he received when he retired from Penn State in 1999. Under Pennsylvania's Public Employee Pension Forfeiture Act, a retiree would have to forfeit their pension funds if they were convicted of offenses like theft, obstruction of justice or perjury. However, molestation and child sexual abuse, which Sandusky has been convicted of, are not among them. A spokeswoman for the State Employees' Retirement System said on Wednesday that the agency doesn't speculate . about potential future actions under the Public Employee Pension . Forfeiture Act. But Nicholas Maiale, chairman of SERS, told the Patriot-News that he is looking to pursue a legal review of the board’s options for Sandusky's pension. He told the paper: 'I am a Penn Stater and I am a citizen of Pennsylvania, and we are all morally outraged about this case and what happened to those kids.' However, Maiale told the paper he's 'not optimistic' that the board can do anything about it . A pension system document says forfeiture can also occur when a school employee commits certain sex offenses against a student. Also on Thursday, the Philadelphia Daily News reported that the taxpayers have underwritten an estimated $1.4million in funds for The Second Mile, Sandusky's charity for troubled youth. Although it has been revealed that Sandusky met his victims through the charity, The Second Mile has continued to collect Pennsylvania-sponsored donations totalling up to $122,861 in the current fiscal year, according to the paper. Sandusky was returned to the Centre County Correctional Facility last week he was convicted of 45 out of 48 charges of child sex abuse. Guilty: Jerry Sandusky leaves court in handcuffs after being convicted of sexual assault last Friday . He faces 442 years in prison at his sentencing, which will take place sometime within the next three months. After the verdict, Sandusky's lawyers said they tried to throw in the towel as the trial began because they had too little time to prepare. Experts have said the seven months between Sandusky's November arrest and trial was fast-paced by Pennsylvania standards. Joe . Amendola, Sandusky's lawyer, told The Associated Press: 'We told the . trial court, the Superior Court and the Supreme Court we were not . prepared to proceed to trial in June due to numerous issues, and we . asked to withdraw from the case for those reasons.' Calm: Sandusky showed few signs of emotion as the verdict was read out in court on Friday night . The . issues included a scheduling conflict with a defence team member and . the need to read a cache of documents produced by a lengthy grand jury . investigation. Judge John Cleland denied their request. The attorneys raised other issues that . could be part of the future appeal, saying a mistrial was sought and . denied over a repetition at trial of a brief part of a November . interview Sandusky had with NBC's Bob Costas. Sandusky, 68, was convicted on 45 of . 48 counts of child sexual abuse on Friday night after 21 hours of jury . deliberations. He will likely die in prison. Amendola spoke out as one of the . jurors in the case said he was swayed by the 'very convincing' testimony . of eight accusers who said Sandusky molested them for years. Shocking claim: On Thursday night, adopted son Matt Sandusky, seen here at court on June 22, claimed he had been abused by Jerry Sandusky . At work: Sandusky on the sidelines of a Penn State game; he was expected to become the team's head coach after Joe Paterno, who died in January . In custody: Sandusky's attorneys have indicated that they will appeal his conviction . In addition, Sandusky's adopted son came . forward to accuse the disgraced coach of abusing him when he was . between the ages of 8 and 15 - just as jurors were deliberating. Matt Sandusky, now 33, was to take the stand during the trial as a 'rebuttal witness' if Jerry Sandusky testified. Jerry Sandusky's lawyers ultimately decided the 68-year-old former coach wouldn't speak in his own defence. Prosecutors say Sandusky met the 10 sex-abuse victims through his charity, The Second Mile, which the coach established in 1977. Experts have said the seven months between Sandusky's November arrest and trial was fast-paced by Pennsylvania standards. Criminal: Sandusky, pictured being escorted to a squad car, is likely to spend the rest of his life in prison . Lockup: Sandusky has been at the Centre County Correctional Facility since he was convicted of 45 out of 48 counts of child abuse . Joe Amendola, Sandusky's lawyer, told The Associated Press: 'We told the trial court, the Superior Court and the Supreme Court we were not prepared to proceed to trial in June due to numerous issues, and we asked to withdraw from the case for those reasons.' The issues included a scheduling conflict with a defence team member and the need to read a cache of documents produced by a lengthy grand jury investigation. Judge John Cleland denied their request. Almost immediately after the verdict, Penn State President Rodney Erickson signalled an openness to quickly settle potential civil lawsuits arising from the convictions, saying the school 'wants to provide a forum where the university can privately, expeditiously and fairly address the victims' concerns and compensate them for claims.' The university recently reported a $1.8billion endowment. Speedy verdict: It took the jury less than two days to reach a conclusion on all of the 48 charges against Sandusky, pictured with his wife Dottie, left . Jailed: The former coach's bail was revoked immediately after the verdict was announced . The conviction of Sandusky brought an end to a horrific saga which has trashed the reputation of a . leading public university - as well as its storied football programme - and ended the career of its president as well . as its legendary head coach, Joe Paterno, who died of cancer in January. After . the verdict was announced in the courtroom in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, . Sandusky's bail was revoked and he was taken to the Center County . Correctional Facility. Sandusky . showed little emotion as the verdict was read. The judge ordered him to . be taken to the county jail to await sentencing in about three months. In court, Sandusky half-waved toward . family as the sheriff led him away. Outside, he calmly walked to a . sheriff's car with his hands cuffed in front of him. Taken away: Sandusky is being taken to a local jail, where he was placed on suicide watch .

The rain was of almost biblical proportions as the Queen made an historic Diamond Jubilee visit to Northern Ireland yesterday. Indeed her ground-breaking trip was briefly delayed as her plane from London to Enniskillen had to be diverted to Belfast because of the weather. The Queen arrived slightly late in County Fermanagh by helicopter. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Delight: Thousands of well-wishers gathered to give The Queen a warm welcome as she arrived in Enniskillen on her Diamond Jubilee tour . Visit: The monarch wore a powder blue coat and hat with white detail for the first day of the historic trip . But the conditions did not deter . people turning out in their thousands to greet her as she and Prince . Philip travelled into the town by car for a service of thanksgiving at . Enniskillen Cathedral. The Queen’s two-day tour is . particularly momentous as today she will – almost certainly under the . glare of the cameras – shake the hand of former IRA commander Martin . McGuinness, now Northern Ireland’s Deputy First Minister. Enniskillen was devastated by an IRA bomb during a Remembrance Day service in November 1987. The Queen's colourful fashion choices . are often a topic of interest for royal watchers, but today's . distinctive blue-and-white ensemble attracted more interest than usual. The white floral design across the . powder blue crepe wool coat and hat gave the outfit a likeness to the . signature pottery of Wedgwood. Indeed, while the hat is no different . in shape to the millinery she has worn for decades, some have - perhaps . unfairly - compared it to a covered cheese dish from the crockery . manufacturer's iconic Jasperware collection, first designed in the late . 18th Century. The garments, designed especially for her visit to Enniskillen, Northern Ireland, were designed by royal couturier Angela Kelly. Her Majesty paid tribute to her hosts in the form of a dazzling diamond shamrock brooch. The look was otherwise accessorised in . typical style, with pearl earrings and necklace, white gloves and her . favourite black Launer bag . Eleven people were killed that day – . with one dying later – in one of the worst atrocities of the Troubles. The royal couple met some of the families affected. The Queen also went on an impromptu . walkabout to meet dozens of the those who had been waiting patiently to . catch a glimpse of her. She wore a Wedgwood blue outfit and . hat by Angela Kelly, which featured hand-embroidered white lace on the . coat and dress, and was finished off with a shamrock diamond brooch. She . collected dozens of posies from cheering well-wishers. Although her controversial meeting . with Mr McGuinness is being heralded as a significant step in the peace . process, it will undoubtedly prove difficult for the 86-year-old . sovereign who has seen members of her own family, notably Prince . Philip’s much-loved uncle, Earl Mounbatten of Burma, murdered by . republicans. He was assassinated by an IRA bomb planted in his fishing . boat in 1979. The gesture has also been the subject . of huge debate among Sinn Fein members. But Mr McGuinness, who still . faces questions about the true extent of his terrorist past despite his . move into politics, himself made clear yesterday that he approved of the . move. ‘This is about stretching out the hand . of peace and reconciliation to Queen Elizabeth who represents hundreds . of thousands of unionists in the north,’ he said. ‘I am an Irish . republican now. After I meet with Queen Elizabeth, I will still be an . Irish republican, and just as passionate about freedom, justice and . peace, and reconciliation, as I was the day before.’ Following complaints by republicans . that the handshake could be seen as condoning the jubilee, it will now . take place at a neutral venue – a celebration of culture at the Lyric . Theatre in Belfast – and will also be attended by the President of . Ireland, Michael D Higgins. The Queen greets wellwishers outside a Thanksgiving service in Enniskillen, Northern Ireland . Royal wave: The Queen and Prince Philip arrive in Enniskillen where in 1987 an IRA bomb killed 11 Protestant civilians and wounded 63 others as they commemorated British dead .

While a photograph of the moment was ruled . out last week, sources have now said discussions are continuing about . allowing the handshake to be recorded. Yesterday, in a sign of inclusiveness, . clerics from all denominations took part in the service at the Anglican . cathedral including the head of the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland, . Cardinal Sean Brady. The jubilee was celebrated with prayers for those . who serve their communities. The Queen’s trip to Enniskillen also . saw her make her first visit to a Catholic church in either Northern . Ireland or the Republic.

A . used-car salesman has been jailed for life for murdering his estranged wife, . their young son and his father-in-law by setting fire to their family . home after his marriage collapsed. Danai . Muhammadi, 24, was fuelled by 'spite, anger and resentment' when he . killed Melissa Crook, 20, and their 15-month-old son Noah by torching . the house in Chatham Hill, Chatham, Kent. Melissa’s father Mark Crook, 49, was left critically ill with severe . burns in hospital following the fire just before 2.30am on September 10 . last year and he died six days later. Judge Mr Justice Sweeney, sentencing at Maidstone Crown Court, told Iraqi-born Muhammadi that he will spend at least 38 years behind bars before being eligible for parole. Happier times: Melissa Crook and her future killer Danai Muhammadi on their wedding day . The court heard how Muhammadi . and his friend, bouncer Farhad Mahmud, 35, squirted petrol through the . letter box using a garden spray container, leading to fire breaking out . at the base of the stairs. The location of the fire cut off any reasonable means of escape for the family who were asleep upstairs as the blaze took hold. As . smoke and flames filled the three-bedroom terraced house, Melissa . collapsed in an upstairs bedroom and was found dead by firefighters . lying by her son who was wrapped in a quilt. Amid . the chaos, her brother Bohdan jumped out of a front bedroom window, . causing fractures to his feet and hands. He then tried to get back . inside to reach his mother, Amanda, who eventually managed to escape. Her . husband, Mark Crook, meanwhile, tried to flee the building by following . his wife out of an upstairs window on to a flat roof outside. But . 26-stone Mr Crook got stuck in the window frame just as a fireball blew . the windows out. He . suffered 80 per cent burns and was taken to a specialist burns unit in . East Grinstead, West Sussex, where he never regained consciousness in . the intensive care unit. He died six days later. Mahmud was also found guilty of three counts . of murder. Muhammadi and Mahmud were both also found guilty of two counts of attempted murder. Muhammadi’s . new girlfriend, jobless Emma Smith, 21, was cleared of three counts of . murder and two counts of attempted murder but convicted of three counts . of manslaughter after a six-week trial at Maidstone Crown Court. The judge said that while she was not the principal figure, she was a 'joint perpetrator in the common venture to burn the house'. Scene of tragedy: The Crook family home in Chatham, Kent, was left gutted after the blaze . Escape: Melissa's brother Bohdan Crook (left) broke his feet and hands when he jumped from the burning house while her mother Amanda watched in horror as her husband burned after becoming stuck in the window . Judge Sweeney said the actions of Muhammadi 'can truly be described as pure, selfish wickedness' - adding that Melissa Crook and Noah 's last moments, trapped by the flames, must have been 'of abject terror. He said: 'No-one who heard the evidence in this case will ever forget Mrs Crook’s description of how, as he tried to escape, her husband became stuck in the bedroom window and how, unable to extricate himself, she had to stand and watch as his lower half was burned. 'It’s no thanks to you two that Amanda Crook and Bohdan Crook escaped the fate that you intended for them. 'Each suffered significant injuries, the effects - whether physical or mental - they are still clearly suffering from today.' Mr Justice Sweeney acknowledged that Muhammadi was the 'principal offender', adding: 'The enterprise was all your idea and you drove it forward to its conclusion.' He said that Mahmud’s actions were borne out of 'misguided friendship' with Muhammadi and his expectation of significant financial gain from him. Mahmud was sentenced to life with a minimum term of 34 years prison before being eligible for parole. Muhammadi's girlfriend Smith showed no emotion as she was jailed for 14 years. The couple's marriage collapsed after six months amid arguments and emotional conflict involving their son . The judge told her: 'You joined the enterprise because you were the girlfriend of Danai Muhammadi. 'It was an on-off relationship in which, as I have already said when passing his sentence, he used you to get Melissa back.' He added that like both Muhammadi and Mahmud, Smith had shown not 'a spark of genuine remorse' for her actions. In the weeks before the fire, the court heart how Melissa Crook's relationships with Muhammadi and Smith deteriorated. Smith . had started a relationship with Mrs Crook’s estranged husband, Danai . Muhammadi, and in four-letter text message exchanges she taunted Melissa . about their 'great life together'. Smith also mocked Mrs Crook . about her size, for being 'boring' in the bedroom and added: 'Enjoy your . life with no husband, no house... no money you gold-digger.' Amanda Crook, 50, said she felt 'sick' when she learned Danai Muhammadi was suspected of starting the . fire that killed three generations of her family. Mrs . Crook escaped the burning building in Chatham, Kent, along with her . 22-year-old son Bohdan - Melissa’s brother - but both said the end of . the court case would not bring them closure. She said: 'We weren’t . just anyone, we were family, and the fact he (Muhammadi) did it to his . wife and his own child and his father-in-law. 'He’s taken away our whole lives, just because of his greed, and that’s all it was. It was greed.

It's an unlikely venue for the dramatic culmination of a major world-wide hunt to recover a stolen Rembrandt masterpiece. But police may have discovered a treasured work by the Dutch artist during a dramatic swoop on Croydon High Street. In an extraordinary twist in an operation to recover the proceeds of crime, officers are thought to have found a missing oil on canvass. Masterpiece: Experts have been called into examine the work which is thought to be by legendary artist Rembrandt, pictured in this self-portrait . Police were seen treating the potentially . precious object with extreme caution . as they removed the work from the building in south London following the raid on Monday June 11. Now experts have been called in to examine the work of art to establish if the work recovered, really is a Rembrandt masterpiece. Scotland Yard, who are being  tight-lipped about which one of the 205 currently missing works by the Dutch master, also arrested a businessman in his sixties. Detectives from the Metropolitan Police's specialist crime directorate made the discovery during a long-running investigation aimed at recovering assets from criminals. Security expert Richard Ellis, who has worked with the Met Police's specialist Art and Antiques squad, said: 'If this is a genuine Rembrandt oil painting, I think £2million would be a massive undervaluation. 'If you were to put one before an auction today it would fetch between £30million and £50million. Mr Ellis, who last year was part of the . team which recovered two paintings by Pablo Picasso stolen from a Swiss . exhibition in 2008 in Belgrade, Serbia, added: 'To sell a real Rembrandt on the open market would be really, really difficult. 'Any buyer undertaking their due . diligence would look at the catalogues of Rembrandts and it wouldn't . take them very long to see it was stolen.'

It has not yet been recovered. During another 'well planned heist' a Rembrandt drawing worth $250,000, was stolen from a Los Angeles hotel, last year. But it was recovered at a nearby church following an anonymous tip-off. Experts from the Linearis Institute, which owns the pen-and-ink work, known as 'The Judgment,' later verified its authenticity.

Pepsi Challenge: The error has cost the 32-year-old a cool £500,000 a year after Coca Cola decided it had no choice but to terminate the contract which was due to run until 2014 . Ronaldinho reportedly took a sip from one of the cans during the question and answer session for his new club Atletic Mineiro which he joined last month. The soft drink giant said it could no longer continue working with the two-time Fifa world player of the year. A statement released on Monday read: 'Coca Cola recognizes the career and the value of Ronaldinho. 'However due to recent developments it has become impossible to continue the partnership.' The mistake may not have been all Ronaldinho’s fault however, Atletico Mineiro is sponsored by Pepsi and the cans are thought to be put on tables during press conferences as a matter of course.

A killer obsessed with fictional spy Jason Bourne has been jailed for a minimum of 26 years after he stabbed a grandfather to death and went on the run like the Hollywood hero. Matthew Quesada, 26, developed an ‘unhealthy interest’ in the thriller trilogy and spent hours online researching the combat moves used by star Matt Damon. He killed retired bus driver Alan Smith at a cafe in front of the 63-year-old’s family after his victim asked if Quesada’s crying daughter was ‘all right’. Jailed: Matthew Quesada, who knifed a man to death who asked if his crying daughter was all right . Quesada looked ‘smugly’ at his fatally-injured victim and then ran off, aping Bourne’s athleticism by vaulting a series of garden fences. Police believe he was acting as if he was the spy when he plotted his escape, burning his clothes and shaving his hair. He researched travelling to Brazil in an internet cafe and had a list of 49 flights to Sao Paulo when police caught him. Unlike Bourne there was no dramatic car chase - Quesada was arrested in the passenger seat of his mother’s Nissan Micra. Quesada tried to pretend he was mentally ill to escape responsibility but was convicted of murder by an Old Bailey jury last month. His girlfriend Maria Brigette, also 26, was convicted of assisting an offender by trying to help him avoid detectives investigating the killing, while mother Victoria Passley-Quesada, 54, was cleared of assisting an offender. Passing sentence, Judge Peter Rook QC told Quesada he was guilty of a ‘truly grave crime’. He said: ‘Your totally unprovoked attack was carried out in front of his long-term partner, son-in-law, and daughter, as well as customers and staff. ‘Mr Smith did no more than get up and ask if the child was all right. Your reaction was wholly unexpected and wholly out of proportion. ‘You carried out a frenzied attack, lunging at him four or five times. ‘He had no chance to take any avoiding action, and nor did anybody else present have any chance to prevent the lethal attack. ‘This . dreadful attack took less than a minute. During that minute, you took . away from Mr Smith his most precious possession: life itself. ‘His . partner, family, and friends have suffered a most terrible loss, and . their lives will never be the same again. The toll upon his family has . been, and will carry on being, massive.’ Handing Brigette a nine-month jail . term, suspended for two years, along with 200 hours of unpaid work, . Judge Rook added: ‘You knew at the very least he had been involved in a . very serious assault. ‘However, . I accept that at that stage you did not appreciate that he had . committed a murderous attack, and I also cannot say on the evidence . before me that you knew he had a knife.’ Quesada and Mr Smith initially clashed at the BB Cafe in Leyton, east London, of the afternoon on March 26 last year. Mr . Smith, from nearby Walthamstow, and his wife had gone for a meal to . celebrate their daughter Estelle’s birthday with her husband, Mark . Jenkins. When he asked about Quesada’s weeping daughter, the killer snapped: ‘What’s it to you? What’s it got to f***ing do with you?’ Family man: Alan Smith was celebrating his daughter's birthday when he asked after the crying young girl . Enraged, Quesada dropped his daughter off at home and collected a knife. By . the time he returned, Mr Smith and his family were so shaken by the . earlier confrontation that they had moved on to the Roma Cafe in Lea . Bridge Road. Prosecutor . Roger Smart said: ‘Matthew Quesada entered the cafe soon after the . deceased and his family had sat down inside and, without a word, . launched into a deadly attack upon Alan Smith - stabbing him to the . head, and crucially, to the body. ‘During this frenzied and wordless attack, Quesada stabbed Mr Smith at least five times, causing fatal wounds.’ Mr Smith’s daughter Estelle said: ‘We sat down, and the guy came in. I stood up and he lunged at my dad with a knife.’ She . tried to put herself between her father and Quesada while her husband . picked up a nearby chair to hit him with, but the fatal attack was over . in seconds. Doctors performed open-heart surgery on a cafe table but Mr Smith died in hospital later that afternoon. A post-mortem report showed the blade had pierced Mr Smith’s heart and both of his lungs. His long-term partner Denise Facey said the knifeman was ‘in a frenzy’ as he carried out the killing. ‘He was a lunatic,’ she said. ‘Blood was just pouring and Alan’s head was bleeding - there was blood all over the floor. Also guilty: Maria Brigette, Quesada's partner, was convicted of assisting an offender . ‘The worst thing was that, when he left, he didn’t just go running - he stood at the door looking, with a smug look on his face.’ Following the attack, Quesada ran home by jumping over garden fences and burned his clothes, before his mother helped him to shave off his hair and research flights at an internet cafe. His girlfriend kept him updated on the whereabouts of police in the area by text message. He was arrested the following day in the passenger seat of his mother’s Nissan Micra, clutching his passport, a change of clothes and a list of flights to Sao Paulo due to depart that evening from Heathrow. But as officers handcuffed him, the killer, whose previous convictions include assault, threatening behaviour, and criminal damage, told them: ‘Me and my mum were just working out how I was going to hand myself in.’ Detectives later found the murder weapon, wrapped in a blue plastic bag, hidden behind the base panel of a cooker at his home. Two hunting knives, a sheath knife, pellet gun, pick-axe head, and crossbow were also found in his bedroom, while the charred remains of his clothing had been stuffed in a bag and placed in a cupboard. Quesada’s uncle, the boxer Patrick Passley, said his nephew had been obsessed with the Bourne spy trilogy for years. ‘He kept on going on about this Bourne Identity,’ he said. ‘He just kept going on and on about it. ‘That’s when I first became concerned about his behaviour. He kept on saying the guy could defend himself and his family. The way he was going on about it was unhealthy. Afterwards, all the time I knew him he kept going on about it.’ Quesada also told him: ‘I want to be in a position I can do that and do all the combat moves and take a knife off somebody. Anybody attacks me, I will be able to sort him out.’ Mr Passley said Quesada used to ‘rant under his own breath’ about people disrespecting his family and in one incident slashed his chest with a kitchen knife in front of his partner and young child. He said he ‘bottled out’ of calling police because he feared his nephew would be sectioned. After his arrest, Quesada told psychiatrists he believed Mr Smith was a paedophile. Forensic psychiatrist Dr Samrat Sengupta said his actions were consistent with someone suffering from schizophrenia and other ‘paranoid illnesses’. Brigette claimed she had no idea about the killing - or about Quesada’s stash of weapons - until their home was raided by police. Passley-Quesada said she thought her son might have been in trouble with a local gang when he came to her for help. Quesada, of Hibbert Road, Walthamstow, denied murder. Brigette, of the same Walthamstow address, and Passley-Quesada, of Lower Barn Road, Purley, south London, both denied assisting an offender.","Matthew Quesada, 26, had an 'unhealthy interest' in the thriller films .

The first Victoria Cross to have been awarded to a private in the First World War was today sold at auction for £276,000. Private Sidney Godley 'set the standard for the British Tommy' when he took a machine gun from a severely wounded officer and despite shrapnel wounds and a bullet lodged in his skull continued to hold his position alone for two hours against heavy German assault. When he was ordered to withdraw, Private Godley, then 25, maintained a covering fire until the entire battalion was evacuated, but was eventually overpowered by the enemy and taken as a prisoner of war. The Victoria Cross group of six was awarded to Private Godley, Royal Fusiliers, for his defence of the Nimy Bridge at Mons in the Great War and is expected to fetch £140,000 at auction later this month . His brave actions defending the Nimy Bridge at Mons on the August 23, 1914 during the first infantry attack of the war earned the Royal Fusiliers soldier the highest decoration in the British Army. When word got back to King George V about his astonishing bravery, he was recommended the award although army chiefs first thought it would be a posthumous award - until word got back to Britain that Pvt Godley had miraculously survived after being operated on at a German field hospital. London auctioneers Spink are putting the Victoria Cross group of six up for sale in their upcoming Orders, Decorations, Campaign Medals and Militaria auction on July 19. It is estimated to fetch between . £140,000 - £180,000, but they suspect it will attract huge interest and . may exceed expectations. Oliver Pepys, medal . specialist at Spink, said: ‘The Godley Victoria Cross is . both hugely important and highly emotive. I would say it’s one of the . most significant of the great Victoria Crosses because it is the first . of the World War One, so it was not surprising that it attracted much interest' Private Sidney Godley was awarded the Victoria Cross in 1924 for his bravery at Mons . 'I am delighted the sale drew attention to . such a valiant man, who through his actions at Mons set a standard that . the British Tommy would aspire to for the rest of the War. 'He brought honour to his regiment and that legacy will live on, as a sign of what he endured for his country.' The Victoria Cross was snapped up by a private collector who placed the £276,000 bid before the auction began. The recommendation by Lieutenant FWA Steele, Royal Fusiliers, states: ‘In the defence of a railway bridge near Nimy, 23rd August 1914, Private Godley of ‘B’ Company showed particular heroism in his management of the machine guns. ‘His Commanding Officer having been severely wounded and each machine gunner in turn shot, Private Godley was called to the firing line on the bridge and under heavy fire he had to remove three dead bodies and proceed to an advanced machine gun position under a sustained enemy fire. ‘He carried on defending the position for two hours after he had received a severe head wound.’ The announcement of the award - given during the first infantry attack of the Great War - was published in the London Gazette on November 25, 1914. It read: ‘For coolness and gallantry in fighting his machine gun under a hot fire for two hours after he had been wounded at Mons on 23rd August.’ Mr Pepys said: ‘The courage was extraordinary. It would have been very easy for him to sit and obey orders and when the order came to withdraw, to withdraw. He definitely stood up to the plate.’ Sidney Godley was released at the end of the war and moved back to his home in East End of London. He worked at the Tower of London as a volunteer for the rest of his life as a leading member in the Old Contemptibles Association - a group created to ensure the ordeal of the conflict was never forgotten. He died in 1957.

The so-called 'Naked Rambler' Stephen Gough has been arrested three days after he was released from prison. Gough, a former Royal Marine who hikes across the country naked, was arrested in Townhill, . Dunfermline, this afternoon by officers from Fife Constabulary. He was released from Perth Prison on Tuesday, having spent the past six years in the Scottish jail. A spokesman for . Fife Constabulary said he was arrested following complaints from members . of the public and has been charged with breach of the peace. The . 53-year-old, from Eastleigh in Hampshire, earned the nickname by . walking unclothed from Land’s End to John O’Groats after quitting his . job as a lorry driver. 'Naked Rambler' Stephen Gough has been arrested three days after being released from prison . He said earlier this week that he planned to walk to England to see his family. He . told the Sun: 'My children are teenagers so I expect they are . embarrassed by me. If I was them and my dad was walking around naked, I . suppose I would be embarrassed.' Wearing just a backpack – he had few other belongings when he entered . maximum security Perth Prison – Gough stood still to enjoy the . breeze. He was arrested within 60 seconds of his last release and fully expected the police to do so again. But, in an apparent shift in attitude, the rambler had been allowed to go on his way. At the time, he vowed to continue walking around Britain without any clothes on – albeit away from busy main roads. Gough is interviewed following his release from Perth Prison a few days ago . On his release a few days ago, he said: 'It is nice to be standing here feeling the breeze. 'I haven't been outside a building in the last six years and it is nice to smell the flowers and see the greenery. 'I was kept in solitary all the time. I wasn't given association with . other prisoners. I got half an hour in the evening to have a shower and . walk up and down the hall when they had been locked away.' Gough was jailed for 657 days last August for a breach of the peace and contempt of court. The breach was leaving HMP Perth naked after finishing his previous sentence. He was also found to be in contempt after representing himself at the sheriff's court – naked. Gough, who has been convicted 17 times in 10 years, immediately returned to the very cell he had left only hours earlier. It is a pattern that has repeated itself since May 2006. He said his latest jail term had 'flown . by' and that he had been looking forward to seeing his teenage children, Kiana, . 16, and Yarin, 14. 'The first thing I have to do is look through my stuff as I haven't seen it in six years,' he said. 'I am going to head south and see what happens. I haven't seen my kids . for ages. It's not all free and easy for me as I might get arrested at . any moment. 'I don't know what I am going to do. I could get arrested when I go round the next corner.' And sure enough, that is what happened today. He added: 'This is my job. This is my vocation in life at the moment. I have absolutely no regrets. Before being re-arrested, the eccentric father-of-two had planned to 'head south' on his next naked journey . 'To conform with everyone else is the easiest way but when you conform . you compromise your principles. I am not going to give up. Stay naked is . the word.' Gough became known as the Naked Rambler after he tried to walk unclothed from Land's End to John O'Groats in 2003. Gough celebrates reaching John O'Groats following the completion of his naked walk from Land's End in 2004 . He was repeatedly arrested and served four months in Inverness Prison, . reaching John O'Groats in 2004. He set off again in 2005 and was . repeatedly arrested once he reached Scotland, serving two prison . sentences before arriving in 2006. He returned home but on a flight back . to Scotland in May 2006 he was detained once again for a breach of the . peace after he went to the toilet and removed his clothes. He has been . in prison ever since. While in prison Gough kept fit by doing step-ups on a chair in his cell. On his last release, Gough was arrested . within 60 seconds for breaching the peace. He . appeared naked in the court dock and was also found guilty of contempt . of court for failing to display the 'decency' required by the court . process. Gough had . claimed arresting him for walking around naked was a breach of his human . rights and his right to freedom of expression. Sheriff . Fletcher said: 'The court expects people to come here in a decent state . of dress. That has been explained to you in the past. I gave you the . opportunity to dress yourself.' Despite . his preference for nakedness, Gough did concede that he could . understand why people would want to wear clothes in a country with . Scotland’s cold climate.

An overlooked bill for $140 nearly lead to a New Jersey plumber and his wife losing their home in a tax lien fight. Dominick Vulpis told MSNBC how he became one of a growing number of people whose property tax liens are sold to real estate investors who then demand missed payments plus interest from the homeowners. In the case of Mr Vulpis and his wife Lindarose, the $140 charge and four years of interest payments coupled with lawyers fees added up to $50,000. Contentious property: Dominick and Lindarose Vulpis live in this home in Lincroft, New Jersey and because they missed one $140 payment, they were at risk of losing it all together . 'It was never brought to my attention until it was too late and we were served with papers saying we had to move out of our house,' Mr Volpis told the news site. On the surface, the issue of the overdue bills does not seem surprising or new. However it is the numerous transitions of said overdue bill that come as a surprise. At risk: Now Lindarose Vulpis (pictured) and her husband have to pay nearly $50,000 in interest rates and backpayments as well as legal costs . In the case of Mr Vulpis, that is a surprise that nearly cost him his home. With a number of towns filing for chapter 9 bankruptcy- including three municipalities in California- city governments across the country are looking for ways to bring in some much-needed cash. One quick fix, that has potentially unintended consequences, is if the city government sells the rights to the unpaid tax liens on homes in their jurisdiction to investors who hope to recoup the amount due from the unpaid bill as well as the interest that they can collect during the elapsed time. 'Now you're seeing more and more single-family homes pop up on the tax lien list. They're owner-occupied homes with people who are having trouble keeping up with their tax payments,' Anthony Mercantante, the Middletown, New Jersey administrator who sold the Vulpis tax lien, told MSNBC. While the profits on individual homes may not be enough for the towns to stave off bankruptcy completely, these moves have helped amass a surprisingly large financial band-aide. The National Consumer Law Center released a report saying that in 2010, local governments collected a total of $15billion by selling off home tax liens. Said liens are scooped up by a wide range of investors- like, in the case of the Vulpis home, a group called Approved Realty Group- who turn around and charge the homeowners for their missed bill payments plus interest with rates that can go as high as up to 18 per cent. Depressing trend: More local governments are selling off their liens on owned-homes to investors who then demand the missed payments plus exorbitant interest rates from the owners or else they sell the property . That meant that Mr Vulpis was hit with a bill for $37,500 from Approved Realty Group. They worked out a way for the bill to be paid in conjunction with their mortgage, but because of the pre-existing mortgage payments and the legal fees that came with the lien battle, the entire episode will end up costing the Vulpis’ approximately $50,000. For families in similar situations, such agreements cannot be reached and result in foreclosed homes. ‘I think he stuck me up without a gun, this guy. If he was a nice guy he could have said “Ok, I understand what happened, give me $5,000 for my troubles,” but he wanted a lot of money,’ Mr Vulpis told MSNBC.","New Jersey couple missed a home payment of $140 four years ago .

A widow with Alzheimer's was found bound and murdered in her bed with her credit cards strewn across the floor, shocked neighbours said. Scotland Yard detectives have begun a murder inquiry after the body of 76-year-old Pam Wheeler was discovered at her home in Thamesmead, south-east London. They were investigating the theory that Mrs Wheeler, described by neighbours as a 'lovely lady', was killed during a 'burglary gone wrong'. Investigation: Police search for clues in the street in Thamesmead, south-east London, where Pam Wheeler was found dead in her bungalow . Residents said she had not been seen for up to a week and they had been concerned about her health. They said her body was discovered shortly after 6pm on Sunday by a concerned next-door neighbour who had gone to her bungalow and found the back door open. Mrs Wheeler, who had recently recovered from breast cancer, lived alone after husband Dennis died a few years ago. Police yesterday dredged the drains in the quiet street as they searched for clues. Neighbour Toby McClay, 20, said: 'The neighbour found her. She went into the house and she had her arms and legs tied up, like someone had gone in there to do a burglary that had gone wrong. 'We used to see her all the time walking her three dogs, I think they were Jack Russells, but they were taken away from her because she couldn’t look after them. 'They used to bark all the time and if they had been there someone would have heard them. Hunt for evidence: A police officer searches a drain near Mrs Wheeler's home . 'It’s out of order, someone targeting a women like that because she’s old. 'It’s a bungalow and they could have jumped over the back wall.' Another neighbour, Tracey Smith, 39, said: 'I think she had Alzheimer’s. She never had anyone come over to see her. 'Her husband died a few years ago and that’s when she changed a bit. It’s really, really sad. 'Something should have been done and somebody should have looked after her and then this wouldn’t have happened. 'Pam was really friendly with the children and you would always see her taking her dogs for a walk and she was happy but after her husband passed away she would stand outside at night in her dressing gown on her own and the girl next door phoned the council and said I think she needs help. 'She did have a carer who came round occasionally and she was mobile but she obviously had a few problems. 'My friend is next door. She went in and found her on the bed but I think she had at least her hands tied. Her credit cards were out on the floor. 'She said she was lying in a state and I don’t know if she had been there for a few days. 'My friend was in such a state yesterday that she didn’t manage to tell me if it looked like she had been beaten up.' A woman neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: 'Pam was a lovely lady. She didn’t bother anybody, she was very quiet and independent. 'She was always very friendly and polite and would say ""hello"". 'Her husband (Dennis) died a little while back so she’s been living there alone. I’m not sure if she had any children, although she may have had step-children. 'One of our friends who lives next door to her found her last night. No one had seen her for a little while so we were worried about her. Theory: Detectives are investigating suggestions that Mrs Wheeler was killed during a 'burglary gone wrong' 'The neighbour noticed that Pam’s light wasn’t on at night and that the back door was open. 'When she went inside yesterday she found Pam in the front bedroom. It was a huge shock for her, she’s in an awful state. 'Things like this just don’t happen around here. It’s a quiet road, we never have any problems. Everyone here always looks out for one another and we’re all very friendly. 'For something like this to happen is really scary. 'Everybody is now trying to remember when they last saw Pam. I hadn’t seen her for at least a week, possibly longer than that.' A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: 'We’re keeping an open mind but a ""burglary gone wrong"" is one line of investigation. 'There were no obvious signs of stab or gunshot wounds.'","Pam Wheeler's body found in bungalow in Thamesmead, south-east London .

Sir Michael Caine’s son-in-law yesterday lost his case for an injunction and damages against an ex-convict debt collector he said had ‘menaced’ him for an unpaid £67,000. A High Court judge rejected Michael Hall’s claim for up to £50,000 to cover extra security costs and an order that Kevin Fox keep away from his home and offices, saying that Mr Hall had told ‘untruths’ about the shaven-headed 45-year-old. Security consultant Mr Fox had been sentenced to seven years in 2006 for his part in an £1.4million armed raid on a gold bullion warehouse.glance most people would believe the solemn word of a respectable millionaire businessman, married to the daughter of Sir Michael Caine, over a convicted criminal. Court case: Michael Hall who is married to Michael Caine's daughter Natasha, left, 'told untruths' to win an order in the High Court against Kevin Fox, right, pictured leaving the courthouse in London today . In February this year, he had been pursuing a £67,000 debt allegedly owed to a former business associate of Mr Hall, Ian Wilson, now living in South Africa. Mr Hall, 40, a millionaire property developer, told the court that his wife, actor Sir Michael’s daughter Natasha, 39, was so frightened by ‘underworld enforcer’ Mr Fox that her hair ‘turned white’. But yesterday Mr Justice Richard Seymour dismissed Mr Hall’s claim he had been harassed by Mr Fox, saying that he had painted him as a ‘stage villain’. He ruled that while Mr Fox might appear to be a ‘gangster’, he had consistently told the truth when Mr Hall had failed to be frank to the court. Mr Hall had obtained a temporary High Court injunction earlier this year, ordering Mr Fox to keep away from his central London offices, and his homes in Wimbledon and Chelsea Harbour. Mr Hall has two sons, Taylor and Miles – who both have ‘Michael Caine’ as their middle names – and a daughter Alegra with Natasha, who he married in 2007. Issue: Mr Fox, had been pursuing a £67,000 debt allegedly owed to a former business associate of Mr Hall, pictured left, with wife Natasha, along with Michael Caine and his wife Shakira . Part of the conditions of the permanent injunction Mr Hall was seeking was that Mr Fox would not come within 100 metres of him or any members of his family. However, in a damning judgement yesterday after a three-day hearing the judge made it clear that Mr Hall had made false statements to the court to get the initial injunction and refused to make it permanent. Taking cover: Michael Hall, hides behind a newspaper as he leaves the court after failing to get a restraining order against the former foreign legionnaire . He said it was obtained from Mr Justice . Keith ‘in breach by Mr Hall of his duty to give full and frank . disclosure of all relevant matters to the judge’. In his conclusions, the judge said: . ‘Mr Fox is a middle aged man of medium height. He looks as though he . keeps himself fit. He is balding, but his hair is shaved.’ The judge continued: ‘Mr Hall struck me as a somewhat timorous person. ‘It may well be the physical . appearance of Mr Fox frightened Mr Hall, while various references to Mr . Fox’s reputation were never made very specific. ‘Whatever that reputation was alleged to be may well have frightened Mr Hall. ‘However I’m satisfied whatever fears Mr Hall entertained were not justified by anything Mr Fox actually said or did. ‘Mr Hall would have me find Mr Fox to be some sort of stage villain. ‘I’m satisfied Mr Fox has many resources of character he can rely on without resorting to violence.’ The judge said Mr Fox’s account that he had not acted in a menacing . manner had been supported by CCTV evidence from outside Mr Hall’s . office. The judge said: ‘What he said was demonstrated to be correct. Claims: Mr Hall had painted the powerfully built security consultant as a 'stage villain' - but the judge said Mr Hall had failed to be frank to the court .","Michael Hall fails in bid to get restraining order against former foreign legionnaire .

Brave: British airman Flight Lieutenant George Reid plucked a stricken comrade from the sea as Germans approached in 1916 . A medal awarded to a pilot for his daring sea rescue of a stricken comrade during World War One has sold at auction for £11,400. Flight Lieutenant George Reid was returning from an aborted air raid in Germany when he landed his seaplane on the water to save a stranded colleague. He was cheered on from the shore during the audacious rescue by German locals who were unaware that the men were British. The extraordinary story emerged as the medal Flt Lt Reid received for the rescue, the Distinguished Flying Cross, was sold to a private collector. Flt Lt Reid, from Devon, saved his colleague while making his way back through heavy snow from an aborted raid on Zeppelin sheds at the then Tondon, in northern Germany, in March 1916. He spotted a stranded British seaplane on the water and landed next to it before taking off again with his comrade strapped to the wing as German soldiers approached. However, Flt Lt Reid's luck ran out later when his own plane developed engine trouble as he tried to return to an aircraft carrier in the North Sea. He was forced to land in the water again, and they were picked up after drifting for three hours. He was held in prison camps for the remainder of the war but tried to escape several times, even breaking his leg on one occasion when he jumped from a fast-moving train. Flt Lt Reid was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross at Buckingham Palace in 1919. Honoured: Flt Lt Reid, pictured at Buckingham Palace, after being awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross in 1919 . It was one of the first medals awarded for bravery in the air. After the war Flt Lt Reid opened a flying school and engineering firm in Leicestershire before moving to Jersey, where he sailed his yacht and raced thoroughbred horses. He died in 1969, aged 80. A spokesman for London-based Spinks auctioneers spoke of Flt Lt Reid's act of bravery after the sale of the Distinguished Flying Cross and other medals the pilot owned. 'It was an incredibly brave and audacious rescue of a comrade in distress, right under the noses of the Germans,' the spokesman told the Daily Express.

As she relays information to the officers about the shooting in theatre nine, they begin to radio in news of victims they are discovering. One officer says: 'Somebody is spraying gas in here too' in reference to the smoke grenade James Holmes, 24, allegedly threw into the packed theatre before opening fire. Another officer radios in: 'I got another person shot here, female. I got people running out the theatre. Concern about the gas is evident when an officer asks: 'Do we have gas mask available?'

A 14-year-old boy who died after falling from a boat and apparently being hit by the spinning propeller has been described by his parents as a talented hockey player who dreamed of representing Great Britain at the 2020 Olympics. Charlie Hutton died on Friday after he and a friend, also 14, fell from a boat driven by his father Simon, 52, as they sailed from Mudeford, Dorset to the Needles landmark off the Isle of Wight.The friend suffered serious but not life-threatening injuries. Another 14-year-old boy managed to stay on board the vessel - a rigid hull inflatable boat - along with Mr Hutton. Charlie Hutton, 14, was described by his heartbroken parents Simon and Gill as 'academically bright, an accomplished musician and an amazing field hockey player who had trained with the England under-15 team and had hoped to reach the England under-16 team this year, with the ambition of eventually playing for Britain in the Olympics in 2020.' Police say there are no suspicious circumstances but are investigating how the two boys fell overboard. Charlie, who attended the £14,424 a year Whitgift school in South Croydon, was taken to Southampton General Hospital by the coastguard helicopter but medics were unable to save his life. His injured friend was taken to St Mary's Hospital on the Isle of Wight after being taken to shore by an RNLI lifeboat. Charlie's devastated parents, Simon and Gill Hutton paid tribute to their multi-talented son in a statement issued by police. They said: 'We are very sad to announce the death of our beautiful and very talented boy. 'Charlie, who loved the sea and water sports, was a schoolboy at Whitgift in South Croydon. 'His life touched many people and we know schoolfriends will be devastated. 'Two of his closest friends were with him when he died and I hope they remember the great times and laughs we had with Charlie in his final few days in Dorset. The 14-year-old died after falling overboard from a rigid hull inflatable boat navigated by his father, Simon. Two of Charlie's best friends were with the family when he died - another 14-year-old boy sustained serious but not life-threatening injuries in the horrific accident. 'Charlie was academically bright, an accomplished musician and an amazing field hockey player who had trained with the England under-15 team and had hoped to reach the England under-16 team this year, with the ambition of eventually playing for Britain in the Olympics in 2020. 'His effort, passion and self-belief would surely have taken him there. 'With Ashley Jackson as his hero on the field, we hope that this same passion will help Great Britain win gold this year for Charlie and the country. The tragedy happened as Charlie and his father, Simon, sailed towards the Needles off the west coast of the Isle of Wight with two of Charlie's best friends . The Isle of Wight is popular with sailors and Charlie Hutton was described as a lover of the sea and water sports . 'Our thanks go to all those who helped Charlie achieve such an incredible amount. 'We would like to hold a private event for family and friends to celebrate Charlie’s life in the autumn when his school returns from the summer holidays.'

Callous: James Bray looked unrepentant at Southend Magistrates' Court today, where he was jailed for animal cruelty . A cannabis-smoking dog owner who killed his pet by throwing it out of a tenth floor window to 'teach it a lesson' has been jailed. Sick James Bray, pictured, launched eight-year-old Deano out of his flat window in Southend, Essex, after the Staffordshire bull terrier relieved itself on his carpet. The innocent dog suffered multiple injuries and died as a result of extensive internal bleeding following the tragic incident on January 18 this year. Bray made a rude gesture at the cameras as he arrived at Southend Magistrates Court today, wearing a short-sleeved white shirt and looked emotionless as lead magistrate Bill Thomas sentenced him to four months in prison. The court heard how callous Bray tied up his dog in the bathroom of his flat for four hours after it had misbehaved. When he returned to untie the dog at around 3am he found it had weed on the carpet. He flew into a blind rage and attacked the dog before throwing it from the tenth-floor window. Bray called the police after launching his dog from the window and stunned officers by confessing to the sickening assault. In police interview he told shocked officers: 'It was a really good shot - I launched him by the scruff of his neck and he bounced off the window and went down. 'Maybe I was just out of my depth with this dog. 'Usually I’m really good with animals - I don’t drown kittens or salt slugs. 'I got carried away and angry at the time. Long way to fall: Bray launched the dog out of his flat window at 3am, having left it tied up for four hours after smoking a cannabis joint . 'I don’t know what came over me - it must be some kind of evil in this world.' Bray admitted to police he had smoked a two-inch cannabis joint on the evening of the attack but said he still completely understood that what he was doing would kill his pet. He told bemused officers: 'I was trying to teach it a lesson'. The heartless thug even tried to escape charges by claiming he had attacked the dog in self-defence after it had bitten him on the foot. Police could not find any evidence the dog had attacked Bray. Bray - who was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and was sectioned following the sickening attack - pleaded guilty to three charges of animal cruelty when he appeared at the same court in May. 2012 . Paul Markham, defending, described the situation as 'tragic' but called on magistrates to consider a suspended jail sentence due to his client’s early guilty plea. He said: 'This is a matter which will undoubtedly provoke public outrage. 'My client has put forward no attempt to excuse his behaviour and accepts what he has done was an evil thing to do.' Magistrates refused to accept Bray’s defence and handed him the maximum sentence available for an animal cruelty offence. Lead magistrate Bill Thomas said: 'This is a horrendous incident which caused the death of a dog. 'There is no evidence this was caused by your mental illness and must be dealt with on the merits of the case.' He sentenced Bray to the maximum six months' imprisonment - reduced by two months in recognition of his early guilty plea. Bray was ordered to pay £500 costs to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and was disqualified from owning or keeping a pet for life. Outside court, RSPCA Inspector Matthew Gough welcomed the prison sentence but called for tougher sentencing for animal cruelty offences. He said: 'I hope this sentence acts as a strong deterrent to show that any cruelty to animals will not be tolerated. 'I think, given the mental health issues involved, the magistrates worked well within the guidelines. 'It would be appreciated if the sentences made available to magistrates for these offences were harsher.'","Tied up dog in bathroom for four hours after it misbehaved .

Out of the blue: The picture Susan Ardron sent her family via Facebook after she contacted them for the first time in 34 years . When Susan Ardron emigrated to South Africa in 1975 communication with her family abruptly ended just a few years later. Completely unaware that she was battling against amnesia following a serious car accident her family presumed she had died. But now after 34 years, as her memory slowly started to come back, she has stunned her siblings by contacting them on Facebook. Still living in South Africa, the 61-year-old was given a helping hand to trace her family in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, by a family she stayed with in Johannesburg. And now, following the bolt out of the blue, her brother Colin, 39, and sisters Dawn, 58, Julie, 50 and Gail, 52, are desperately trying to obtain a passport for their sister to get her back home. Susan left for South Africa with her husband Sid and four young children but when her siblings failed to hear from her they made desperate attempts to find her through the Red Cross and Salvation Army. It has since emerged that a car crash left her struggling to remember her real identity, and left her even referring to herself as Katie. Her husband soon left with their four children, Joanna, 43, Jason, 40, Adele, 38, and Amanda, 36, returning to the UK, and Susan has yet to make full contact with them as she continues to try and come to terms with the gaps in her memory.

In court: Shamed MP Eric Joyce was fined £600 today for cutting off his curfew tag to compete in a parliamentary boat race . Shamed MP Eric Joyce was fined today for cutting off his curfew tag to compete in a parliamentary boat race. Joyce, 51, who was forced to wear the tag after assaulting fellow politicians in a bar brawl earlier this year, used a pair of scissors to cut it off, to avoid negative publicity pictures of him wearing it. Stirling Sheriff Court heard today that the former Labour politician was rowing for the House of Commons against the House of Lords in the London charity race. When it was cut off, it set off an electronic buzzer, and he was contacted by security firm SERCO. Speaking outside court today, he said he didn’t want to let down the organisers of Siemens-sponsored parliamentary boat race, but admitted that he’d made 'an error'. Joyce, who now lives in Stirling, admitted breaching the tag order on July 4 at the boat race, which was held on the Thames outside the Houses of Parliament. His lawyer Dick Sandeman said: 'This is a somewhat unusual case. He was at first not required to wear the tag, but he was eventually told he had to wear one and complied. 'He had agreed to take part in a charity rowing match. It was set to take place on 11 July, the day after his tagging order ended but the race was moved a week earlier. 'He was rowing for the House of Commons against the Lords.' He said the bulky nature of the tag would make it difficult for Joyce to row, and that he was aware the press attention that would be brought by him wearing the tag, so he removed it. This then set off an electronic notice, and he was contacted by security firm SERCO. Police were later contacted. Rule-breaker: Joyce, 51, used a pair of scissors to cut the tag off, to avoid negative publicity pictures of him wearing it while he was taking part in a parliamentary boat race . Sheriff John Halley blasted Joyce for the breach, as he fined him £600. He said: 'You took it upon yourself to remove the tag which you were required to wear. 'You’re recorded as saying that you cut it off to stop your photograph being taken for the charity event. 'It’s not for you or anyone other person under a court order to decide to refuse to comply with the court order. 'You made a clear decision to breach the order. It’s not a reasonable excuse.' Joyce, who paid the fine before leaving court, said afterwards: 'It’s quite a stiff penalty but I’m an MP and it’s perhaps an attempt to persuade others not to do the same. 'The event was very high profile and for charity. I didn’t want to overshadow the charity’s work. If I turned up wearing my tag, that’s what all the papers focus would be on. Me and not the charity. I didn’t feel that was fair. 'I made the decision to cut it off. If I’d knew it was a breach at the time, I wouldn’t have done it. Victim: The former soldier was forced to wear the tag after headbutting the Conservative MP for Pudsey, Stuart Andrew, pictured . 'We didn’t even win in the end. We should have though.' It was the first time since 2008 that the House of Lords rowing crew had won the yearly race. The case is the latest in a long line of negative publicity for the Falkirk MP, who has faced calls from local residents to step down. The former army major earlier this year avoided a jail sentence for throwing punches and headbutting two Conservatives after a late-night drinking session at the House of Commons bar. He was given a 12-month community order after admitting four counts of assault at the Strangers’ Bar, and given a three month curfew in March this year, which involved the curfew. The former soldier headbutted the Conservative MP for Pudsey, Stuart Andrew, and attacked Tory councillors Luke Mackenzie and Ben Maney, and Labour whip Phil Wilson, who represents Sedgefield. Westminster Magistrates Court heard the 51-year-old later told police: 'You can't touch me, I’m an MP.' He was also fined £3000 and was ordered to pay £350 compensation to each of his victims. He has been permanently suspended from the Labour party, and also faced mounting pressure to quit after further claims were made about him, including that he was involved in an alleged inappropriate relationship with Meg Lauder, 19, who was 32 years his junior. He earlier tried to play down his alleged fling with Ms Lauder during the 2010 General Election campaign, who was a schoolgirl when they met, although he admitted spending so much time with her was ill-advised. He added: 'I knew this girl, in fact knew her very well, for two or three months during the campaign. 'But most of the time she refers to us being together, there were other people present. We were campaigning for the election. 'Yes, I spent a lot of time with her and, on reflection, that was ill-advised of me.'","Joyce, who was forced to wear the .

He's one of the most well-liked global leaders in the real world. Now, it would seem, Barack Obama has conquered the online world in the popularity stakes. The U.S. President has been voted the most popular world leader on Twitter with 17million followers. His unrivalled position was revealed in a new survey of how heads of government use the social networking site. His Twitter account @BarackObama - run by his campaign staff but which also features the occasional tweet from the President himself - was responsible for the most popular post of any world leader. On May 9 his message of 'same sex couples should be able to get married' was retweeted 62,000 times, it has been reported. In an age of instant communication, using a Twitter account effectively is seen by politicians, in diplomacy terms, as important as a top-level phone hotline conversation. U.S.-based PR company Burson-Marsteller looked at the accounts of 264 world leaders and government ministers to study the rise of 'Twiplomacy', The Scotsman reported. Obama was the first major politician to harness the power of social media in his 2007 election campaign. According to the study, his account is ranked the fifth most popular on Twitter in terms of followers, just behind U.S. pop star Britney Spears. According to The Scotsman, Jeremy Galbraith - chief executive of . Burson-Marsteller for Europe, the Middle East and Africa - said: 'This study illustrates how Twitter is closing the . communication gap between us and our world leaders. 'On . the one hand, it allows heads of state and government to broadcast . their daily activities and government news to an ever-growing audience. On the other hand, it allows citizens direct access to their leaders. On message: Barack Obama's Twitter account, which is managed mainly by his campaign staff, was responsible for the most popular post of any world leader . 'Consequently, it is now, more than ever, critical for these leaders to get it right on the ­social network.' Obama's account is managed by his campaign team and the vast majority are sent by his staff, much like most government accounts. Out of almost 5,000 tweets, just eight were signed off with the President's initials of 'B.O.' and one of these was a Valentine's Day message to his wife. Obama's account might boast the most . followers, but just 1 per cent of his tweets are replies indicating low . engagement with his followers. In an age of instant communication, using a Twitter account effectively is seen by politicians - in diplomacy terms - as important as a top-level phone conversation . With more than 2million followers, British Prime Minister David Cameron came in fifth in the world leaders league. In second place is Hugo Chavez - president of Venezuela - with more than 3million followers. Thirty-eight per cent of his tweets were replies. Rwandan president Paul Kagame has more than 71,000 followers and 90 per cent of his tweets are replies. The survey also revealed that 99 governments and world leader Twitter accounts have never sent a reply.

Payout: Abdul Musa (pictured) blew the whistle on racism at the Canterbury Street sorting office and was sacked in 2007 . A postman has received a £100,000 payout after he exposed 'endemic racism' at his sorting office where Asian workers were labelled 'cockroaches' and 'vermin'. Abdul Musa blew the whistle on problems at the Canterbury Street sorting office where he worked in . Blackburn, Lancashire between 2006 and 2007. Asian workers, including Mr Musa, were . labelled ‘cockroaches’ ‘vermin’ and ‘P***s’, an employment tribunal heard, and an . Italian worker also received racial slurs and was dubbed a ‘greasy . b******’. But following Mr Musa's complaints he was accused of a string of ‘quite incredible’ racial and sexual counter-accusations, and sacked in early 2007. Postal worker Christopher Eccles was also sacked, as a result of the ongoing abuse, and 12 colleagues were later disciplined. The episode prompted strike action at . the delivery office over Mr Eccles's sacking and the graffiti ‘Kill The P****’ appeared in a . staff toilet, the tribunal was told. Now a judge has ruled that Mr Musa was racially victimised by his colleagues and the judge blasted Royal Mail's investigation into his slurs as 'shambolic'. He said that Mr Musa had . been unfairly dismissed in July 2007 and upheld his racial discrimination . claims. The findings of a five-day tribunal, held in Manchester in January 2012, have only now been made public. The Equality Commission attacked Royal . Mail for failing to protect Mr Musa, from Burnley, following efforts by . a union and fellow staff to drive him out. In a statement the Commission said: . 'The tribunal found that managers at the depot in Blackburn had known . endemic racism was an issue, but failed to act to protect Mr Musa.' Tribunal judge Mrs C Porter said it was ‘quite startling’ that the graffiti’s origins were then never investigated. Mrs Porter added: 'The procedure adopted by the respondent (Royal Mail) for the investigations and disciplinary action was shambolic.' Criticism: The Equality Commission attacked Royal . Mail for failing to protect Mr Musa at the Canterbury Street sorting office in Blackburn (pictured) An internal Royal Mail inquiry, conducted by an independent investigator, Neil Donovan, decided that Mr Musa, who is of Indian origin, was racially, verbally, and physically harassed by more than a dozen colleagues. Concerns were also raised by the judge about the actions of the Communication Workers Union in ‘priming’ and ‘intimidating’ witnesses, during a series of internal inquiries. But the findings of a later Royal Mail . investigation into the wider issues identified at the Blackburn office, . was said to have not been made available to the tribunal by the . company. The episode pushed the Blackburn . sorting office to the brink of strike action in support of sacked . postman, Christopher Eccles (pictured) The tribunal ruled . Mr Musa’s continuing employment was seen as a ‘problem’ by Royal Mail, . ‘which was resolved by his dismissal.’ The . tribunal heard how one worker, accused of mimicking Asian colleagues, . was sacked and three colleagues were suspended after an internal probe . at the Blackburn office. Mr Musa was himself sacked in 2007 after a counter-allegations were made against him by colleagues. Giving evidence, he denied calling fellow Asian postal workers ‘cockroaches and vermin’ and several sexual misconduct claims. The episode pushed the Blackburn . sorting office to the brink of strike action in support of the sacked . postman, Christopher Eccles, and three suspended colleagues. Mr . Musa alleged that he was ‘sent to Coventry’, in 2006 and 2007, and . repeatedly complained to management that he was being isolated and . ignored by workmates. He claimed he was called by a colleague, whose voice he recognised, late at night and told: 'You want to watch your back.' The . former postman accused Royal Mail of failing to support him, after he . made his original complaint, and breaching his confidentiality. He said details of his claims were handed around the sorting office for others to read, leading to further intimidation. Mr . Musa told the hearing: 'None of my Asian colleagues stopped talking to . me. If it had not been for their support the affect on my health would . have been even worse.' He claimed the allegations against him were an ‘act of revenge’ by colleagues after he highlighted racist culture at the sorting office. John Wadham, a former director of Liberty and now general counsel for the EHRC, said: 'The fact that his colleagues were acting unlawfully was not enough to stop them from victimising Mr Musa. 'People facing discrimination also need an advocate, such as the Commission, to make sure that the law is obeyed.' The EHRC funded Mr Musa’s case after his previous legal representation withdrew from the proceedings. A Royal Mail spokesman said: 'There is no room in Royal Mail for racism or any other form of discrimination. We are committed to investigating any complaint of discrimination fairly and thoroughly.'","Following Abdul Musa's complaints he was accused of racial and sexual counter-accusations .

Kathia Marie Davis is alleged to have engaged the teenagers in sexual activity in her own house while her children were elsewhere in the property, it is alleged. The divorced mother-of-three appeared in court and pleaded not guilty to charges relating to having unlawful sex with a minor under 16-year-old and committing a lewd act with a minor under the age of 14. Accused: Kathia Davis (pictured) is alleged to have engaged the teenagers in sexual activity in her own house while her children were in the property . The two victims, who have not been named, are members of the same hockey association as Davis's 18-year-old son. However, through her attorney, Davis - from Laguna Niguel in California - claimed she had to rebuff the advances of a 13-year-old that came on to her and that she believed the other boy, who she had consensual sex with, was the same age as her son. Davis was placed under investigation after the 16-year-old told his mother what had happened and she contacted authorities, it has been reported. According to KTLA, Orange County Sheriff's spokesman Jim Amormino said: 'We received complaints that she was throwing parties for members of the hockey team and other friends of her son and providing them with alcohol.' The two victims, who have not been named, are members of the same hockey association as Davis's 18-year-old son . She is accused of having intercourse with the 16-year-old on four occasions in her bedroom between July 2010 and July 2011 and prosecutors say two of her children were in the house during some of those incidents. It was during the course of the investigation with the 16-year-old that the younger boy came forward and made accusations against Davis, KTLA reported. She allegedly fondled the 13-year-old during a sleepover at her house after giving him alcohol. The full list of charges Davis is facing are as follows: Four felony counts of lewd acts on a child younger than 14; four of unlawful sexual intercourse with the second boy; three misdemeanor counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor; one allegation of substantial sexual conduct with a child. If convicted, she faces a maximum of 17 years and eight months behind bars in a state prison.

Jennifer Carroll has been indicted on conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute prescription painkillers . The brother-in-law of Florida Lt Governor Jennifer Carroll has been indicted on charges of illegally distributing prescription pain medication. Edward Beckles, 59, who owns and operates his own pharmacy in Pasco County, appeared in court Monday on charges of providing prescription pain medication such as Oxycodone to two drug rings that have known activity in the area. The allegations come days after Carroll’s damaging statement saying that women who look like her are not lesbians, and her own legal headache over an alleged affair with a female staffer. Beckles, who is married to Carroll’s sister, is accused of filing fraudulent pain killer prescriptions for the drug rings. His pharmacy was raided earlier this month on the conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute, the Grio reported. It was the culmination of a gruelling two-year investigation by the DEA and the Pasco County Sheriff’s office. Carroll’s office issued a statement Tuesday saying that the Lt Governor was ‘not familiar with Mr Beckles’ arrest or his business practices and she has never visited his pharmacy. 'She is surprised and saddened that this has happened to her sister’s family.’ Last week, she apologised for offending lesbians when she said black women who engage in same sex relationships don't look like her. Carroll made the controversial remarks more than two weeks ago while denying allegations from a fired staffer who claims she walked in on the politician and a female travel aide in a compromising position. Family business: Edward Beckles owns and operates Ed's Family Friendly Pharmacy, centre . Pill mill? Beckles allegedly was filling false prescriptions for Oxycodone at his pharmacy (stock photo) 'It is wrong and inexcusable to make a comment that hurts people, and that was not my intention,' Carroll wrote in a letter to Equality Florida, a group that seeks equal rights for gays and lesbians, on Thursday. 'As a Christian, my faith guides me to love and respect all people. The false charges that have been lodged against me are no excuse for what I have said.' The claims about Carroll were made by fired staffer Carletha Cole, who is charged with secretly taping a conversation with Carroll's chief of staff. Cole allegedly gave the recording to a newspaper reporter. 'Please know that I am committed to treating every person with the utmost respect and dignity and I hope you will accept my heartfelt apology,' Carroll, who has been married for 29 years and has three children, wrote. Nadine Smith, Equality Florida's executive director, said the governor also called her to apologise for her comments. 'I want to thank the lieutenant . governor for taking responsibility for her words and for responding to . the harm those words inflicted,' Smith said. 'Apologies by elected leaders for . public mistakes are rare and it is to the lieutenant governor's credit . that she has taken this step.' Sex scandal: Florida governor Rick Scott and his deputy Jennifer Carroll have been mired in allegations from a former aide about affairs and phone tapping . When asked about the claims made by her ex-employee Cole, the Republican replied: 'Usually black women that look like me don't engage in relationships like that.' The controversy arose after Cole was fired and subsequently prosecuted for allegedly taping a conversation with another aide and illegally leaking it to a newspaper. However, she claimed that the real reason she had been sacked was because she walked in on  Carroll having sex with a female aide, Beatriz Ramos.

Sensational: Carletha Cole, 48, was fired from her job and is on trial for giving an illegally taped phone conversation to a newspaper . Cole said earlier this month that she witnessed Carroll and Ramos, in a 'compromising position' inside Carroll's office. She also claimed that Carroll's chief of staff secretly recorded conversations at the direction of those working for governor Rick Scott, and that the trash can at Cole's desk might have been deliberately set ablaze following an argument between her and Ramos. Cole also said Ramos was living at the lieutenant governor's home and at one point she was ordered by Ramos to find adjoining hotel rooms for the pair when they traveled. The disgruntled aide said that she was 'scolded' by Carroll's security team when she placed  Ramos next door to Carroll when the lieutenant governor and her husband traveled to Puerto Rico last summer. The agent told her to not do it again, Cole said, but did not explain why. Lieutenant governor Carroll, a former Navy officer who is also a mother-of-three, said the allegations are all lies. 'That's . totally false and absurd,' said Carroll, a former Republican legislator . who was chosen by Scott as his running mate in 2010. Carroll . said the allegations are an attempt by Cole and her attorney to get the . criminal charges against Cole dropped. The former aide was charged with . a third-degree felony and could serve up to five years in prison. Carroll said: 'They are trying to pull at straws.

A huge traffic jam was witnessed near Karkardi More in the capital as traffic signals were not functioning following a massive power failure at northern grid .

Pulled: Chris Grayling said the video got the 'tone wrong', so the Ministry of Justice took it down . A Government minister has been accused of 'trying to censor' a video aimed at helping people to appeal when they have been stripped of their disability benefits. Employment Minister Chris Grayling interfered with the content of an official film to make it more difficult for people to overturn decisions, Labour claimed today. The video, which has since been removed, told viewers that if they appear at a hearing in person they are twice as likely to win, which Mr Grayling told officials made its 'tone wrong' and 'negative'. The minister said it distracted from the issue that appeals will consider the facts of the case in front of them, not if someone has turned up. It also said that the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) don't always send a representative to hearings. 'A couple of times it's noted that a claimant is twice as likely to win . their appeal if they turn up in person – again this is broadly true, but . doesn't help to reduce the opinion that it isn't the facts of the case . that are important, but the turning up in front of a tribunal and . pleading their case,' an email from Mr Grayling to the Ministry of Justice said. After this e-mail was sent the video, presented by appeals doctor Jane Parry, was taken down so its content could be considered. It was also removed from YouTube for copyright reasons. Scroll down for video . Help: The video, presented by Dr Jane Parry, gave advice to viewers including the one subtitled . 'I think for the moment we should wait to see what comments they [MoJ staff] come back with. It may be that we feel the whole tone of the video is wrong and could not be fixed,' an email from the Minister's account later said. Timms told the Guardian today the emails a showed Mr Grayling is 'ignoring the needs of disabled people.' 'Many people are finding they have to appeal against wrong decisions on their disability benefits,' he said. 'With cuts to legal aid, it will be harder in future for them to get help. Now DWP ministers are stopping people even from seeing a video that might help them, produced by the Ministry of Justice.' Complaint: The minister said the video detracted from telling people to concentrate on the facts of their case . Down: The video was removed for copyright reasons and its content is still being reviewed by the MoJ . The Department for Work and Pensions told MailOnline Mr Grayling never asked for the video to be pulled. 'At no point did the Department ask for the video to be taken down,' a spokesman for the DWP said. 'We raised some concerns about factual . inaccuracies in the video, MOJ officials agreed with our concerns and . sought to revise the content.' This week it was revealed that thousands of people have been on sickness benefits for a decade or longer because they suffer from conditions including acne, bad backs and persistent coughs. Official figures show that 885,100 have been signed off as being too sick to work and given incapacity benefit for ten years or more. They have a bewildering array of conditions. Nearly 70,000 have been signed off due to bad backs while a further 140,000 have been away from the work place because of ‘depressive episodes’. Ten people have been on incapacity benefit for a decade or more because of acne, while 670 have been signed off because they are obese. 'Reform of the broken incapacity benefit system is about saving lives, rather than writing people off to a life on benefits as used to happen,' Mr Grayling said. ‘The reassessment of 1.5 million people on incapacity benefit and the work capability assessment we use means we can take account of conditions that change over time. If you can work you will get all the help and support you need to do so.’ He added: ‘These figures show the scale of the problem and the ludicrous situation that used to exist and why we are right to reform the system.’","The film was made to help people appeal against benefits decisions .

"By . Chris Brooke . PUBLISHED: . 08:51 EST, 1 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 01:56 EST, 2 August 2012 . Pollen from a garden has helped to identify the killer of a nine-year-old boy 28 years after the shocking crime. Police announced today they had solved the mystery of Christopher Laverack’s murder and named his uncle Melvyn Read as the killer. Read, a convicted predatory paedophile, died from natural causes in prison four years ago at the age of 65 while still a suspect for the schoolboy’s murder. Murder mystery: Police claim they have solved the 28 year mystery of who murdered Christopher Laverack, pictured left, through scientific advances and named his uncle Melvyn Read, pictured right, as his killer . However, thanks to new scientific advances, vital forensic evidence was obtained linking Read’s garden to the victim. Unusual pollen spores and other plant material specific to Read’s garden were found on Christopher’s clothing. And a brick found with the schoolboy’s body was forensically shown to have been part of a water feature in Read’s garden. Read lived a 10-minute walk away from the house where Christopher was staying the night he vanished in March 1984. The schoolboy was left alone with an 18-month-old baby for about 70 minutes when the toddler’s father went to the pub. He returned to find Christopher missing and called police. Final piece of the puzzle: Scientific advances meant that unusual pollen spores and plant material found on Christopher's clothing were matched with those in Read's garden (stock image) His body was found two days later in a beck. He had been savagely beaten to death with a blunt instrument and there was evidence of a sexual assault. Christopher had been placed inside a large plastic bag weighed down by an ornamental brick - later found to be from Read’s garden. The killer eluded detectives, but a breakthrough came in March 2002 when the boy’s uncle Melvyn Read was arrested for sexually assaulting four young boys who were known to him. Although some of these crimes dated back to the late 1980s they all took place after the murder. Read was jailed for seven-and-a-half years in April 2003 and a police review of the unsolved murder showed a strong circumstantial case against him. He lived locally, owned a car which fitted the description of a vehicle seen near the victim’s house on the night, he did not have an alibi, had previous knowledge of the beck where the body was dumped and was shown to have lied to police about key issues in the case. Read had the ‘means and motive’ but the case ‘lacked the final piece of a very complex jigsaw’ because there was no scientific evidence against him. All hope of a confession ended when Read died in 2008, three weeks before he was due to be released from prison. When historical DNA analysis drew a blank Detective Superintendent Ray Higgins of Humberside Police asked Dr Patricia Wiltshire, a leading expert in the study of pollen and plant spores, to look at the case. She concluded there was enough ‘unusual pollen and other plant material’ on the clothing Christopher was wearing when he was killed to link him to Read’s garden. Humberside Police said when Dr Wiltshire finished her work last year there was ‘scientific evidence to show that Christopher had been in close contact with Read’s garden the night he went missing.’ An independent review of the evidence by a leading criminal QC concluded had Read been alive the evidence would have led to a charge of murder and a realistic chance of conviction. Paul Watson, QC, described the weight of evidence as ‘conclusive.’ Christopher’s mother was said to be relieved that ‘some unanswered questions have now been answered’ but police said she still finds the subject of her son’s murder ‘too painful to talk about.’ Det Supt Ray Higgins said: ‘Read was an evil man and a man wholly without remorse. I am satisfied that Christopher’s family can have some sense of closure and understanding of what happened. ‘This case has taken many years to resolve. We would all wish the evidence to convict were available sooner and whilst Read was still alive to face trial, however that was not to be. ‘The few officers still working on this case, between their other duties, have been determined to do all possible to solve the case and have simply refused to give up.’","Police have named the killer of Christopher Laverack, nine, as his uncle Melvyn Read 28 years after the murder .

A university lecturer could be charged with the manslaughter of a schoolgirl who died after taking two ecstasy tablets during a party at his house. The inquest into Isobel Reilly, 15, was halted yesterday by a coroner who said evidence which had come to light during the hearing could incriminate Brian Dodgeon. The 61-year-old academic and his partner, Angela Hadjipateras, allowed their 14-year-old daughter to hold a party for 30 friends as the couple socialised overnight 60 miles away. Possible action: Isobel Reilly, 15, died in April last . year after taking ecstasy at an unsupervised party in the . home of Brian Dodgeon, left, and Angela Hadjipateras. The couple now face possible manslaughter charges . During the house party in north . Kensington, London, four of the schoolchildren swallowed pink ecstasy . tablets they found in Mr Dodgeon’s bedroom closet. Isobel collapsed after taking two tablets and could not be revived. Death: The Kensington home of lecturer Brian Dodgeon where the unsupervised party took place in April last year . Mr Dodgeon pleaded guilty to four . charges of possessing drugs including ecstasy, LSD and  ketamine. He was . sentenced to eight months in prison suspended for two years last . December. Unable to live with the guilt, a week . after Isobel’s death in April last year he tried to commit suicide by . jumping off a flyover. He survived despite suffering several broken . bones and needing brain surgery. He and Miss Hadjipateras may now face . charges of manslaughter on the grounds of gross negligence after coroner . Dr Fiona Wilcox ordered a transcript of evidence heard at the inquest . to be sent to the Crown Prosecution Service. Dr Wilcox said: ‘It is with an . extremely heavy heart that I apply my duty to adjourn these proceedings . because in my view it is likely that a charge of gross negligence . manslaughter could be brought against Mr Dodgeon and Miss Hadjipateras. ‘The evidence, which I have reflected . on, heard yesterday [Wednesday], is different to the evidence that the . CPS initially considered.’ She went on to highlight five issues of . concern. ‘We heard yesterday that the drugs . were readily accessible, that Miss Hadjipateras and Mr Dodgeon already . knew teenagers at parties in their house could behave as teenagers do,’ she said. ‘They knew that even when they were . present, teenagers got drunk, they knew that previously their cannabis . stash in their home had been found and I have concerns that supervision . of the party was inadequate at best.’ On the night of the party, the couple . were staying in Hastings, East Sussex. They had asked family friend . Camilla Mujica, who lived opposite them, to be on standby in case . anything happened. Untimely death: Flowers and candles were left in tribute to the schoolgirl who started foaming at the mouth . Mourning: Friends and family Issy released balloons in memory of the schoolgirl . Paula Sparks, representing Isobel’s family, said ‘they had very serious concerns about the issues that had been raised’. Dr Wilcox is also trying to establish . if Isobel could have been saved if an ambulance had been called earlier . after she suffered a shaking fit and was foaming at the mouth. Her . family consider this to be a key issue. On Wednesday, the opening day of the . inquest at Westminster Coroner’s Court, it emerged that Isobel, from . Acton, west London,  had suffered an adverse reaction to the drugs but . had urged her friends not to call an ambulance because she was afraid of . getting into trouble. Isobel was pronounced dead in hospital . at 6.30am on April 23, hours after paramedics had arrived. She died of . MDMA poisoning, the inquest heard. Mr Dodgeon, who was a research fellow . at the University of London’s Institute of Education, had been due to . give evidence yesterday but never got the chance. A CPS spokesman said: ‘If the coroner sends something to us we will look at it.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Coroner says new charges could be brought as new evidence had been heard not previously considered by the CPS .

France has been driven so 'mad' by British cycling success they are accusing Team GB of cheating, David Cameron said today. The Prime Minister said the French had found the sight of the Champs Elysee covered in Union Jacks to greet Bradley Wiggins' Tour de France victory 'a bit hard to take'. And the thinly-veiled war of words continued today after apparent French sneering at Great Britain's all-conquering triumphs in the velodrome. Rubbing it in: David Cameron said the sight of Bradley Wiggins surrounded by Union Jacks after his Tour win would have been 'hard to take' for the French . Mr Cameron, pictured with French President Francois Hollande at the Olympic handball, had to endure ribbing from the French Premier over the two countrys' medals - a position which has since reversed in the Prime Minister's favour . With riders and coaches raising questions about the legality of Team GB's bikes, Mr Cameron said one French media outlet he was interviewed by 'virtually accused us of cheating'. Just over a week ago, Mr Cameron was forced to suffer a ribbing by French president Francois Hollande about the relative performances of their two countries at that point. Mr Hollande jokingly thanked Britain for 'rolling out the red carpet' for French athletes to win medals - after joining the PM to watch his country play handball. But the tables have been dramatically turned since then, with France now having only eight gold medals so far to Great Britain's 22 - and 20 fewer of all colours. The velodrome has proved a particular cauldron for cross-channel rivalry, British domination of the podium sparking irate suggestions of foul play. And the latest row comes a few months after Bradley Wiggins reacted angrily to a French TV reporter asking him about doping during the Tour de France. France's Gregory Bauge (left) had to make do . with the silver medal as Britain's Jason Kenny swept to victory in the . men's sprint final . Britain's trio of Philip Hindes (left), Jason . Kenny (centre) and Sir Chris Hoy also beat the French into second in the . team sprint final . Mr Cameron, in an interview with Chris Evans on BBC Radio 2, suggested French frustration was a sign of just how well the British system was working. 'We've got a system that seems to be delivering. It's driving the French mad,' he said. 'I did an interview with French television yesterday and they virtually accused us of cheating. I think they found the Union Jacks on the Champs Elysee a bit hard to take. 'We have got a great system so let's build on that and then when we go to Rio in 2016 we can have a good experience.' The premier also picked Mo Farah's victory in the 10,000 metres as his stand-out moment from the Games so far. Mr Cameron, who was in the stadium on 'Super Saturday' when Team GB won three gold medals in track and field, said: 'When I think of the most moving moment for me on that Saturday night, there he was, this sort of slightly lonely figure with the team of Ethiopians and the team of Kenyans chasing him down and trying to stretch him out by having these short bursts of pace and he just kept plugging away and that last lap was just unbelievably emotional and exciting.' Sacre bleu: French sports magazine L'Equipe went for the British cycling team's jugular after its phenomenal success . A recent poll in French magazine L'Equipe asked people to vote on whether they thought British cyclists had cheated at the London Olympics . Mr Hollande's 'red carpet' comments were a pointed retort to Mr Cameron's pledge to do the same for French businessmen fleeing a proposed 75% top rate of income tax. Relations between the pair have been strained since the Prime Minister declined to meet the then Socialist Party hopeful during a campaign trip to the UK ahead of May's election. Attempts to paint that as matter of protocol and not a snub were somewhat undermined by Mr Cameron's subsequent meeting with Republican US presidential candidate Mitt Romney. And it was Labour leader Ed Miliband who was not only first British politician invited to the Elysee Palace for talks with the new president but was granted a rare public handshake. Last week, with Great Britain still languishing in the medal table, Mr Hollande also joked that British sports fans could be heartened by seeing their medals as part of the European tally. 'We will put the French medals in the European bag, and that way the Britons can be happy to be Europeans,' he said. British cycling chiefs have laughed off French claims that 'magic wheels' - with secret technology hidden inside them - may have been the secret to the team's phenomenal success in the track cycling events, where its riders walked away with seven golds from the 10 events. Stars of cycling: Victoria Pendleton and Bradley . Wiggins are just two Team GB riders who have contributed to the home . nation's formidable cycling medal haul . All-conquering: Women's team pursuit riders Dani King, Laura Trott and Joanna Rowsell also claimed cycling gold for Team GB - much to the apparent annoyance of the French . Kings of the track: Sir Chris Hoy, another . cycling hero, is now Britain's most decorated Olympian after his two . golds at London 2012 . And they also pointed out that the wheels in question were made in France. Earlier in the competition, there was another controversy when Philip Hindes admitted to deliberately crashing to earn a restart of the team sprint, in which Great Britain went on to beat France to the gold medal. Despite complaints, the authorities judged that no rules had been broken. Mr Cameron said the main lesson so far from the Games in terms of future success was 'keep doing what we are doing, the way that elite sport has been organised and the way we back our Olympians'. 'I have met a lot of the people involved in that. They are brilliant,' he said. It was also essential to find some way of 'bottling this volunteering', he said, outlining efforts to get the half a million people giving up their time as Games Makers and in other roles to continue their efforts with local sports clubs and other organisations.","French TV reporter 'virtually accused us of cheating' during interview .

Now sitcom star John Challis could be accused of living up to his snobby Boycie character - after he tried to force a nearby children's home to close because two youngsters pinched a bottle of whisky. Mr Challis - who also stars in spin-off sitcom The Green Green Grass - lives just 60 yards from Mill House Care Home. The out-spoken actor has campaigned for the centre, which cares for troubled youngsters, to shut after his Grade I listed mansion was broken into by two teenagers. Sitcom star: John Challis at his home Wigmore Abbey in Herefordshire. Challis has tried to force a nearby children's home to close after two youngsters pinched a bottle of whisky from his home . The thieves broke into Wigmore Abbey in the picturesque village of Adforton, Herefordshire, in February while the actor was on holiday in Hawaii with his glamorous wife Carol, 63. The thieves made off with an expensive bottle of malt whisky during the raid. In the spin-off, which ran for four series, follows the flashy wheeler-dealer Boycie as he takes to the country with his wife Marlene after being forced to flee Peckham. At a meeting to discuss closing the care home, which is run by Keys Childcare, Mr Challis said the centre was in the 'wrong place.' He expressed his concerns at a meeting with the motion: 'Keys Childcare should accept that they have been required to look for another property in a more suitable setting.' Too close for comfort?

Mr Challis, 69, said: 'To be told by the . company [Keys Childcare], after this latest incident when two of the . boys got out and broke into the house on two separate occasions, that . the home did not feel their staff had been negligent, I find . unbelievable. 'They had broken in and stolen some malt whisky. The strength of feeling is very strong. We have been going through this for 10 years. 'The community have had enough, this was the last straw.

'It is a very difficult job but this is totally in the wrong place.' The public meeting also heard that the care home has cost West Mercia Police over £200,000 in the last seven years. Mr Challis was not at home today but his wife Carol, 63, told how the break-in had left the couple 'anxious and fretful'. She added that their 'rural idyll has been left shattered.' She said: 'We've had the children's . home her for ten years but two years ago new people took over and they . didn't know what a mess they were inheriting. 'There have been 19 police call outs . to the home since January. The sight of police cars chasing these . runaways around is now a regular occurrence.

In the last six months, 19 of the 26 crimes in Adforton concerned the care home - including nine calls about missing children. Inspector Nick Semper, of West Mercia Police, said: 'These nine episodes in 2012 have cost £22,500. 'There have been 72 missing persons reports since 2005 costing £180,000. We need to recognise that an inappropriate placing of young people fails everyone. 'The home has existed for more than 10 years, and it is fair to say that it has caused a large impact on local policing over that time.

'cushty', 'plonker' and 'this time next year we'll be millionaires' into . living rooms across the country. It was first broadcast in 1981 and aired in seven series until 1991, with sporadic Christmas specials in later years.

'The point has been reached where local residents state that it has become intolerable.' A proposal that owners Keys Childcare relocate the centre was voted for unanimously by members of the public at the meeting. The company, which has run the home since March 2011, was given a month to respond. Emma Beech, divisional director for Keys Childcare, said: 'The young man who was seen to be instigating that incident was not dealt with by the courts. 'He did not return to the property following that incident. We endeavoured to compensate Mr and Mrs Challis in whatever way we could. 'The incident in February was the first time I was aware with problems with the community. It was us that noticed the burglar alarm had gone off and we called the police. 'The two young people had slipped through the front door. This is a home environment when they get out there is no ""escape"".' The home only houses three young people described as 'extremely vulnerable' by Keys Childcare but according to the company they don’t require secure accommodation. Wendy Chambers, chief operating officer from Keys, said: 'Setting this issue into context, there are only three children in the home and their behaviour is similar to other teenagers. 'We are always happy to respond to concerns and help reassure neighbours we take their worries seriously.'","John Challis lives 60 yards from Mill House Care Home in Herefordshire .

Stantiall (pictured) made the counterfeit tickets and pocketed some money for the deception . IT MUST have seemed like a smart way to travel first class without paying for the privilege. But three friends were caught out after an eagle-eyed rail official spotted a forged ticket. Police were called and discovered that they had been involved in forging and using first class rail tickets and railway car park passes. Old tickets had been scanned on to a computer and the date changed. Their scam involved copying a first class monthly season ticket from Southampton to London Waterloo worth £849.50 and a monthly railway car park ticket costing £130. The three previously well-respected men – Neil Stantiall, construction firm boss John McInally and building worker Mark Batt – have now been given suspended jail sentences for their part in the fraud, which involved dodging more than £2,000 of rail fares and parking fees. Judge Susan Evans QC told them: ‘You were all confident you were too clever to get caught out and you had an arrogant disregard for the basic qualities of honesty and morality.’ She said the men had caused  the railway company a ‘significant loss’, leading to increased prices  for everyone. ‘This was not just an error of judgment, this was serious dishonesty,’ the judge said. Construction worker Batt (left) admitted conspiring to commit fraud after 'wife racked up £20,000 in credit card debt'.  Construction company boss McInally  (right) said he was 'extremely ashamed' ‘You are all intelligent individuals . with responsible jobs.

Unlike . genuine tickets, it was blank on the back. Police . stopped McInally, 46, as he left the car park and recovered three more . fake monthly parking tickets and a first class monthly season ticket. After reading text messages on his phone, officers arrested  Stantiall, 40, and Batt, 34, who is McInally’s brother-in-law. The . texts showed Stantiall made the counterfeit tickets. Although none was . found at his home in Whiteley, Hampshire, the court heard ‘it was clear . he was responsible for supplying the tickets and had received at least . some money for it’.

Police are investigating a nursing home following complaints that elderly residents have been bruised, left filthy and robbed. Officials launched a probe into the operation of 64-bed Honeymead Care Home after families of two residents reported bruises on their loved ones’ skin and poor levels of hygiene. They are also scrutinising allegations that jewellery, including rings and necklaces, was stolen from residents at the £595-a-week care facility in Bedminster, Bristol. Bruises while in care: Resident Violet Hare's relatives made complaints about Honeymead Care Home after the 97-year-old with dementia was found with bruises on her arm . Avon and Somerset Police confirmed today that they had launched an investigation into the allegations and promised to take them ‘extremely seriously’. A police spokesman said: ‘Officers from our Public Protection Unit are aware of these incidents and full investigations are underway to establish if any criminal offences have been committed. ‘We are working closely with our partners in the safeguarding team at Bristol City Council. ‘We take all reports of this nature extremely seriously and are committed to keeping all of our residents safe, particularly the elderly or vulnerable.’ Resident Violet Hare, 97, who has dementia, was found with bruising on her arm. Jewellery stolen: While in the care of Honeymeed, Mrs Hare's (pictured) wedding ring, which she has worn for 70 years, has gone missing . Concerned staff at the home even reported this themselves to police and the council. They took pictures of her injuries and gave them to her family. Mrs Hare’s niece Lyn Caple also reported to police in April that her aunt’s wedding ring, which she had worn for 70 years, was missing. Other missing items such as underwear and a hospital bag were also reported to the home’s management. Living at the nursing home since 2009, Mrs Hare's niece is reluctant to move her. Ms Caple said: ‘I don’t want to move her out of the care home because I’m concerned about the impact it will have on her at her age. I just hope things improve.’ The family of resident Olive Bewick decided to move her to a different care home after she was found with bruising on her shins. Taking it seriously: The nursing home regulator made an inspection last week and Mimosa, the company which runs the home, said they are saddened and disappointed by the complaints and is taking them seriously . Mrs Bewick had lived at Honeymead for five years until, over the last four months, her family became so concerned about her care that they complained to management. Her granddaughter Julie Ryall, 38, said: ‘We noticed things with her personal hygiene. Her nails were absolutely filthy, but she is either in bed or a wheelchair, so it’s not like she was doing gardening. ‘We also noticed dried food on her face where they had not washed it after meals. We also noticed bruising to her legs.’ Mrs Ryall said she and sister Cheralyn Greenaway became worried last week after they discovered that their grandfather’s wedding ring and their grandmother’s necklace were missing. She said: ‘We looked for her necklace and could not find it and went straight to the manager and saw the Care Quality Commission inspector there so we reported it to them.’ The Care Quality Commission carried out . an inspection at the home last week and the report is due to be issued . within several weeks. The regulator has been in meetings with the local . council over the allegations. Too old to relocate: Even though Mrs Hare has suffered bruises to her arm, her relatives are reluctant to relocate her because they worry she is too old to cope with such a move . A spokesman for Mimosa, which runs Honeymead Care Home, said the company was saddened and disappointed by the complaints and was taking them very seriously. She said: ‘Several of the allegations made are now subject to a police investigation and the management and staff of Honeymead is fully co-operating with this investigation. ‘As a consequence at such an early stage of the police investigation it is not appropriate to make any further comment on the specifics of the allegations until the police enquiries are complete. ‘Mimosa is also saddened and disappointed to note the complaints made by the family of Mrs Bewick with regard to the standards of food and hygiene at Honeymead. ‘Again, we take these complaints very seriously and have launched an internal investigation with regard to the concerns expressed by the Bewick family.’ Bristol City Council is monitoring the quality of care by the home, a spokeswoman confirmed. She said: In both cases the council has used the safeguarding adults procedures to work with the police and care home to investigate the concerns. ‘The quality of services is a key priority for the council and we are working with Honeymead to ensure improvements, and monitor the overall quality of care given by the home.’","Police and the local council are investigating Honeymead Care Home after complaints were made about the care of two elderly residents .

A little boy wrote a heartbreaking letter begging his father not to hurt his mother anymore - after watching him kick her on the floor 20 times. Stephen Carter, 36, broke his estranged wife Amanda’s arm in the vicious beating after downing 10 pints of beer while babysitting their seven-year-old son, Oliver. The traumatised youngster heard the onslaught from his bedroom and later wrote an emotional note begging his father never to hurt his mother again. 'Stop hitting mummy': The traumatised youngster heard the onslaught from his bedroom and later wrote an emotional note begging his father never to hurt his mum again (picture posed by model) Carter wept as an extract of the note was read out to the courtroom during his trial for assault. The youngster wrote: 'Daddy, please don’t ever do this to mummy again.' Carter, . from Whitstable, Kent, pleaded guilty to assaulting his wife at . Canterbury Crown Court and was given a nine-month jail sentence . suspended for two years. Sentencing, . Judge Simon James said: 'This was a cowardly and sustained attack on . the mother of your children, perpetrated on her in her own home - part . of which was witnessed by your seven-year-old son. 'He . was so concerned he felt compelled to write you a note pleading with . you never to do anything like that again to his mummy. You will have to . live with the shame of what you did for the rest of your life. 'You should be under no illusions just how close you came to going straight to prison.' Charges: Stephen Carter, from Whitstable, Kent, pleaded guilty to assaulting his wife at Canterbury Crown Court. It heard how he kicked her 20 times when she confronted him about a new relationship . The court heard how Carter was babysitting in October last year while his estranged wife went to work as a manager at a local Tesco store. At 4am - as he slept on the sofa . after drinking 10 pints of beer - Mrs Carter went through his mobile . phone text messages and realised he was in a new relationship. In . a temper, she threw the phone at her estranged husband, hitting him on . the bridge of the nose and causing it to bleed before slapping him a . number of times in the face. As she apologised, Carter then . launched a ferocious attack, kicking her as she pleaded, 'Stephen, . please stop. That’s enough, stop it'. As Mrs Carter got up from the floor her husband renewed his attack, kicking her again up to four times. After arriving at work in severe pain she was sent to the William Harvey Hospital, where doctors diagnosed a fractured arm. She described her injuries as 'more painful than childbirth' and was left unable to hug her children. Prosecutor James Bilsland said the couple’s marriage fell apart amid allegations of drinking and cheating but the two shared custody of Oliver and his three-year-old sister. He said the couple married in 2004, but separated in August 2011 when Carter moved out to live with his mother. Mr Bilsland said: 'The pain she experienced was even worse than the pain of childbirth. 'She said, ‘I remember then thinking I was paralysed. I lost count of the total number of times I was kicked but it was between 15 and 20. 'At this point she felt she was only semi-conscious and the room appeared to go blue and she crawled into a ball. 'She then heard Oliver crying, sat next to him and said: ‘Don’t worry, there will be no more fights now’.' He added: 'Mrs Carter said the relationship had broken down over the previous two years and the defendant had been drinking heavily. 'Afterwards he had become aware she was involved in another relationship with another man. 'They were both struggling to move on from their relationship and had problems with communication.' Carter escaped an immediate jail sentence after a judge heard the couple were hoping for a reconciliation and was handed the suspended sentence and 260 hours of unpaid work. Claire Cooper, defending, said: 'He behaved in a barbaric manner but it was totally, completely and utterly out of character during a period of emotional turmoil.'","Stephen Carter, 36, broke his estranged wife Amanda’s arm as he kicked her around 20 times .

This dramatic video shows the moment a Utah woman smashed her SUV into an office building, with the alleged intent of hitting her estranged husband. Surveillance footage captures 26-year-old Brenda White ramming her Ford Explorer car into the foyer of the building, knocking her ex, John White, to the ground. He drags himself up and runs for his life, dodging out the way of the car, having been chased through a parking garage and into the building. Scroll down for video . Shocking: The SUV smashes through the glass, hitting Mr White . In court: Brenda White said she did not set out to injure her estranged husband . In a 911 recording, obtained by Abc, a distressed-sounding woman can be heard saying: 'This SUV just drove into our building, he's chasing some guy down. 'The car's all the way inside the building. He went through going like 70 miles an hour.' At the time of the incident the pair were in the midst of an 'ugly divorce' police said. Mr White was taken to hospital where . he was treated for broken legs and given 63 stitches over his legs, arms . and face. Mrs White was arrested and charged with attempted murder. She was later released on $500,000 bail. Savage: Mr White is floored by the attack . Injured: Mr White drags himself up off the ground . Mrs White's attorney said she was on a . large amount of anxiety medication and was 'not in her right mind' when . she chased down her former husband. 'On that day, Brenda White's body was behind the wheel of that Ford Explorer,' Jason Schatz said. 'What's in dispute is why this happened.' On trial: Brenda Christine White faces charges of attempted murder and criminal mischief stemming from the 2006 incident . The . incident happened in 2006 but there have been several appeals because . her attorneys have tried to use the defense that she was under . extreme emotional distress. Lawyers argued that she had taken too much Xanax which was partially to blame for the incident. Rare side-effects of taking the drug can include outbursts of anger, delusions and aggressive behavior. Mrs White has since apologised for the attack, which she claims not to remember. Asked what she recalled of the incident she sobbed: 'I don’t. [Being in the parking lot] is the last thing I remember. The next thing I remember, I was inside a building.' She added: 'It was not me. Jon was my husband. He was my best friend, my lover. I would not want to hurt him,' the Salt Lake Tribune reported. Mrs . White claimed to have blacked out after hearing her former husband . speaking on a cell phone and telling another woman he loved her. She . said she had taken a handful of pills on the drive there but had not set . out with the intention of injuring him. 'At some point . in our lives we have all done or said something that we wouldn't have . done if we were in total control of our body,' Mr Schatz added. In his testimony White said he ran from the parking garage when he saw his ex-wife in the SUV. He said he dodged between two parked cars, jumping over a concrete wall, and into the office. At that point, he testified, his ex-wife smashed through the glass and into the building, knocking him to the ground. After being struck he was still able . to get up and continue to run but she drove down a hallway and chased . him, hitting him again. Long process: White's attorneys have pushed for appeals over the past six years, arguing that she was 'not in her right mind' because she had taken too much Xanax before the attack . He said he hid in a closet until a maintenance man found him. Mr White claimed that before the attack, during his lunch break, Mrs White came to his office and played the song Angry Johnny by the singer and songwriter Poe, which includes the lyrics: 'I wanna kill you/I wanna blow you away.' When that lyric came up, she mimicked a gun with her hands and pointed it at his head, he claimed. If convicted Brenda White faces up to five years in jail.

A mayor who provoked outrage by claiming Adolf Hitler had the ‘right idea’ about dealing with Germany’s gipsies, has been rapped by a top government watchdog. Mike Eckersley was condemned for his 'offensive and disrespectful behaviour' after he twice made inappropriate remarks during an equality meeting. The 72-year-old had been accused of breaching Denbighshire County Council's code of conduct following the comments made during meetings of its Corporate Equalities Group. At . one meeting in when referring to gypsies and travellers, Eckersley . was said to have exclaimed: 'As far as I’m concerned they are just . legalised squatters and scroungers and I think Hitler had the right . idea.' An estimated 220,000 gipsies were murdered in the gas chambers or worked to death during the Second World War. At an earlier meeting of the same group, Eckersley made another comments which sparked offence. During a discussion about an ancient bye-law which allows individuals to be . hanged for speaking Welsh in Chester after 9pm, Eckersley - . then a sitting Conservative councillor - blurted out: 'Maybe we should . take a load of Welsh Muslims to Chester to test this out.' Mr Eckersley provoked outrage by allegedly claiming Adolf Hitler had the ‘right idea’ about dealing with Germany’s gipsies . Company director Mr Eckersley - who . has since lost his council seat but is the mayor of Prestatyn, North . Wales -  was formally censured by Adjudication Panel for Wales. The panel considers whether elected members of councils and other authorities in Wales have breached code of conduct rules. Gwyn . Davies chairman of the Case Tribunal said: 'It was incumbent on . Councillor Eckersley to use language and to express his opinions in a . way that . would not cause offence or be disrespectful to others. 'Councillor Eckersley used language that was clearly offensive to others and his apology was an admittance of this fact. 'Clearly . Cllr Eckersley could have been more humble in providing a more fulsome . apology. The Case Tribunal finds with regard to both allegations that . Cllr Eckersley did make the alleged remarks. 'It . is not acceptable for any Councillor to use language and express . opinions in a way that would be inappropriate or offensive to others.' Mr Eckersley's outburst took place during a 'corporate equalities meeting' at the offices of Denbighshire County Council (pictured) The first incident took place in July 2010 when the council held a meeting of its Corporate Equalities Group. After . the meeting Mr Eckersley made his remark, about Welsh muslims as . reference was made to an old Chester bye-law that permitted the hanging . of anyone who spoke Welsh at night. Council . officials reported the remark to a senior colleague but no further . action was taken again Mr Eckersley after the comment was not minuted. However, at a second meeting the following October Mr Eckersley made his Hitler . remarks and was rebuked by the committee chairman who called the meeting . to a temporary halt saying other members of the group did not support . his 'prejudice views'. Although . the remark was, again, not minuted Mr Eckerlsey was later hauled before . the council chief executive who referred the matter to the local . Government Ombudsman which in turn referred it to the Adjudication . panel. 'My remarks were addressed towards those who have suggested that travellers should be returned to their country of origin' The mayor later . issued several grovelling apologies one saying: 'I understand that . certain views I expressed may have been insensitive and misinterpreted. 'I . wish to apologise for any distress that may have been caused by it . happening.' Another read: 'I . do not hold the views that the remarks might suggest that I did hold. Again can I offer my sincere apologies for the unacceptable remark and . any offence caused.' The . panel heard written evidence from Tony Ward, the Corporate and . Improvement Manager at Denbighshire council who said of the Welsh . Muslims remark: 'Clearly, that comment is open, potentially to . interpretation.' He added: 'I . am aware that others may interpret the comment differently however my . views on the comment were that it was an extremely inappropriate comment . to make particularly in the context of a Corporate Equalities Meeting . and even if my interpretation is wrong, if it was meant in the way I . have interpreted it, it goes beyond inappropriate and becomes an . expression of some very dangerous views.' Mr . Ward said he attended the later meeting and was said to be 'shaken' by . Mr Eckersley’s 'Hitler' remark and made a formal complaint. Mr Eckersley has since lost his council seat but is still the mayor of Prestatyn, in North East Wales, pictured . Independent councillor Christine Evans who chaired the meeting said in a letter to the . inquiry that the remark by Mr Eckersley was 'crass, inane and a stupid . remark'. She added: 'I . rebuked him there and then and told him to shut up. I spoke to him at . the coffee break to reprimand him. I could see Tony Ward was shaken. 'Cllr . Eckersley said he had made the remark in the heat of the moment and he . did not mean it. Incidentally Tony Ward did not comment at the meeting . but phoned me up a couple of days later and he said he wished to . complain. So I said he should go ahead.' In a statement sent to Prestatyn Town Council, Mr Eckersley who . survived a vote of no confidence in January last year said: 'I want to . be categorically clear that the words used are not those I said. 'My remarks were addressed towards those who have suggested that travellers should be returned to their country of origin. 'These . views are clearly wrong and I do not regret saying that those views are . tantamount to extremism and intolerance which I have always opposed.' Referring . to the Hitler slur, a later statement said: 'I understand that certain . views I expressed may have been insensitive and misinterpreted.

"By . Snejana Farberov . PUBLISHED: . 19:15 EST, 10 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 01:11 EST, 11 August 2012 . Abdulrahman Zeitoun, a loving husband and Hurricane Katrina hero whose acts of bravery and unjust incarceration inspired a nonfiction book, has been charged with hiring a hit man to kill his ex-wife and two other people. Zeitoun, 54, was booked on three counts of solicitation of murder on Thursday for hiring an Orleans Parish inmate to kill his ex-wife, Kathy, her son from a previous marriage and another man who was often seen in her company, according to New Orleans police spokesperson Remi Braden. The inmate, Donald Pugh, told police that Zeitoun gave him Kathy Zeitoun's cell phone number instructed him to pose as a prospective tenant for one of her rental properties. He was then told to kill her and the two other men once inside the vacant home in exchange for $20,000 – as long as the couple’s four children were not present, according to the New Orleans Times-Picayune. Unraveled marriage: Abdulrahman Zeitoun, right, is accused of trying to have his ex-wife, Kathy, left, murdered after their once-loving relationship has turned sour . The Syrian-born New Orleans resident has gained notoriety after spending days rescuing stranded neighbors in his tin canoe and handing out water in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, ABC News reported. Zeitoun, who is Muslim, was wrongfully arrested by the police and National Guardsmen who mistook him for a terrorism suspect and spent 23 days in lockup without a hearing or the chance to let his wife know of his whereabouts. The dramatic saga was chronicled in the critically acclaimed 2009 nonfiction book Zeitoun by Dave Eggers. One of the focal points of Eggers’ book is the Zeitouns’ loving, happy marriage. But in the years since the volume was published, the relationship between the couple has come undone. Mr Zeitoun was placed on probation for a March 2011 attack on his wife. A police report cited by the Smoking Gun described Zeitoun as pushing Kathy to the floor and punching her in the head. The assault prompted Kathy Zeitoun to file for divorce, which was finalized last year. Zeitoun was arrested again last month after police said he hit Kathy’s windshield with a tire iron on a New Orleans street and struck her with it after she exited her car. The Times-Picayune reported that ‘Kathy Zeitoun said he later punched and choked her before a bystander intervened.’ Dave Eggers' 2009 book about the Zeitouns focused on the loving relationship  between the couple amid the unfolding natural disaster . Zeitoun had been still in jail in connection to the July attack when he was charged with soliciting the murders. The New Orleans Times-Picayune reported that Kathy Zeitoun, her son and the husband of a friend, Ahmad Al-Akoum, were supposed to be killed while her ex-husband was behind bars to ensure that he would not be a suspect. However, instead of carrying out the murders, the would-be hit man revealed the plot to police. Pugh was able to pick Zeitoun out of a photo lineup and produced an envelope with Kathy Zeitoun's phone number written on it. Dave Eggers, author of the bestselling novel, and Jonathan Demme, a filmmaker who has expressed interest in adapting the book into an animated film, issued a joint statement and said they have been in daily contact with Kathy Zeitoun since the July 25 attack. Hero: Zeitoun gained fame during Hurricane Katrina after spending days rescuing his stranded neighbors in his tin canoe and handing out water . ‘Our primary concern is for the safety and well-being of Kathy and the children. As the investigation proceeds, we hope that you will join us in respecting the Zeitoun family's privacy at this difficult time,’ they wrote. The New York Times reported that ‘in an interview with The New Orleans Times-Picayune, Ms Zeitoun said the book had accurately portrayed their relationship at the time. But she said her ex-husband had since grown angrier and more violent and his Islamic views had become more ‘radical.’’ After the book, the Zeitouns and Mr Eggers started a foundation to aid in the revitalization of New Orleans which has distributed more than $250,000 in grants, according to its website. Zeitoun is being held on $999,000 bond for the solicitation to murder charges and $150,000 for the domestic abuse charge.","Abdulrahman Zeitoun, 54, was charged with hiring inmate to kill his ex-wife, her son and a male friend for $20,000 .

Lawsuit: Mostafa Ahmadi-Roshan was killed in Tehran in January when two motorcyclists attached a magnetic bomb attached to his car . The families of nuclear scientists from Iran who were assassinated in 2010 have filed a lawsuit against Israel, the U.S. and Britain, saying the countries are responsible for the deaths of their loved ones. Rahim Ahmadi Roshan, father of Mostafa Ahmadi Roshan, the slain chemistry expert and a director of the Natanz uranium enrichment facility in central Iran, said the families are demanding those behind the killings should be brought to justice. At a press conference in Tehran today, he said: 'We've filed an indictment against the . Zionist regime and the arrogant powers. '(The . judiciary) is to pursue this case with the relevant international . bodies.' Earlier this month, Iran's state television broadcast the purported confessions of 14 suspects held in connection with the killing of five nuclear scientists since 2010. The television also showed pictures from a military garrison, said to be a training camp outside Tel Aviv in Israel. It said the suspects took courses there, including how to place magnetic bombs on cars, which was the method used to assassinate the scientists. The suspects said in the purported confessions that they received training in Israel. Iran claims the attacks are part of a covert campaign by Israel and the West to sabotage its nuclear programme, which the US and its allies suspect is aimed at producing nuclear weapons. Iran has denied this. The country has also blamed Israel's Mossad, as well as the CIA and Britain's MI6 for the assassinations, with support from some of Iran's neighbors. Assassinated: Nuclear scientists Masoud Ali-Mohammadi, left, and Majid Shahriari, were both killed by bombs . The U.S. and Britain have denied involvement in the slayings. Israel has not commented. 'Through this complaint, we declare to the world that actions of arrogant governments, led by the U.S., Britain and the occupying Zionist regime, in assassinating nuclear scientists and elites is against human principles,' said a statement read out by Mansoureh Karami, wife of slain Tehran University physics professor, Masoud Ali Mohammadi. She added: 'While filing our complaint and announcing our protest, we resolutely declare that not only will such disgraceful acts not prevent the advancement of the children of this land in science, it will cause them to take more effective steps with greater determination.' Under suspicion: Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation, where Majid Shahriari worked, has been accused by the West of producing nuclear weapons . In May, Iran hanged Majid Jamali Fashi, 24, who was sentenced to death for the 2010 killing of Ali Mohammadi. Fashi, who said in televised confessions that he was recruited by Mossad, was convicted last August. Officials say the campaign against Iran includes the abduction of Iranian scientists, the sale of faulty equipment and the planting of a destructive computer worm known as Stuxnet, which briefly brought Iran's uranium enrichment activity to a halt in 2010.","Relatives are demanding those behind the killings are brought to justice through 'international bodies'

She started swimming with her brother as a way to make friends because, as she says, 'we didn't know anybody'. But Katie Ledecky won't need to worry about not being recognised anymore after the 15-year-old, and the youngest member of Team USA, breezed to a gold medal on Friday. Ledecky flew into the lead during the women's 800m freestyle and snatched the title with a time of 8:14.63, beating defending Olympics champion, British swimmer Rebecca Adlington. Scroll down for video . Winner: Fifteen-year-old Katie Ledecky holds her gold medal after winning the women's 800m freestyle final and setting a new U.S. record. She first started swimming as a way to make friends . Her time even smashed the U.S. record of 8:16.22, which had been held by Janet Evans since 1989, and just missed the world record of 8:14.10, set by Adlington in Beijing in 2008. She won four seconds ahead of Mireia Belmonte Garcia of Spain, who touched . in 8:18.76, while Adlington . finished in 8:20.32 for bronze. Not bad for a girl who's only just completed her freshman year of high school and hasn't even got her driver's learning permit yet. Ledecky is the youngest of the 529 Team USA athletes and now the second youngest swimming gold medalist in the team's history after Beth Botsford, who won gold in Atlanta in . 1996. She had never even swam a major competition before the Olympic tryouts in June, as her coach had wanted her to work steadily towards the big titles despite her obvious talent. From freshman year to the Olympics: Ledecky, pictured left in her Stone Ridge High School picture, is the youngest member of Team USA and the second youngest U.S. swimming gold medalist ever . Shock: Ledecky gasps as she realises she has won gold on Friday. Her astonishing time comes just two months after she took part in her first major competition . Joy: Before the race, Ledecky's mother said they were just hoping for a good experience - nothing more . Power: Ledecky's time of 8:14.63 just fell short of the world record of 8:14.10, set at the last Olympics . 'I always thought of the Olympics as . this unreal thing,' Ledecky, who stands at 5 ft 10, said earlier this summer. 'My only goal, . when I was six, was to make the A meets.' Rather than swimming in the senior nationals last summer, she swam in the junior nationals, where she won three events and the high-point trophy. 'Katie could . have skipped some steps, but she has learned from each experience and . still moved up the competitive ladder,' Coach Yuri Suguiyama said. 'Some people questioned us not taking her to Nationals last summer, but I . think it was great that she was able to go to Juniors, win four races . and win the high-point award.' The hard, consistent work of her coaches in her hometown of Bethesda, Maryland has clearly paid off; Ledecky swam 21 seconds faster in . London than she had the same time last year. Team: Ledecky, right, with the other swimmers on Team USA, including gold medalist Missy Franklin, left . Having fun: Ledecky's mother said she has enjoyed the camaraderie of the Games and has come out her shell . She's not the first 15-year-old from Maryland to qualify for the Olympics. The last was Michael Phelps in 2000. He now has the most Olympics medals ever at a staggering 21. Her family joined their local Maryland pool in 2003, and she and her brother Michael joined the swimming team as a way to make friends because 'we didn't know anybody', she explained. Despite meeting friends in the pool and at Stone Ridge High School, Ledecker and her teammates admit that she is still shy and reserved. 'I’m not into much pop 15-year-old kind . of things,' she told Yahoo Sports, adding that she doesn't even have her driving . learner's permit yet. 'She is adorable,' veteran swimmer . Natalie Coughlin added to NBC. 'The first few days she was . so quiet because she was really young. Proud: Left, Ledecky poses in her USA Olympics uniform. Right, she grins after her impressive win . Support: After the race, Ledecky hugs British swimmer Rebecca Adlington who won the event in the 2008 Beijing Olympics and set a new world record. This year, Adlington won bronze . Disbelief: Ledecky, pictured hugging Adlington, said the Olympics were never on her radar . 'But with rookie skits and everything . else, she really broke out of her shell. It's hard when you're 15, but . she's doing an amazing job.' Before her daughter's astonishing feat, Mary Ledecky said it was this social aspect of the Olympics that Katie was enjoying most, but that they had no expectations for anything more - like a medal. 'She loves being on the team and really . appreciates and respects the vets on the squad,' Mrs Ledecky, who is in London to watch her daughter, said. 'She's enjoyed practicing with them. There a couple . traditions the team has. The rookies put on a skit for the vets. She . participated in that. She participated in the YouTube video that some of . the older kids on the team spearheaded. 'They've just been terrific. Overall, she's going to come away from this with a really great . experience. That's what we hope for.' Defeated: Ledecky now holds the U.S record for the 800m freestyle, taking the title from Janet Evans (pictured) Smile of a winner: Ledecky poses with silver medalist Mireia Belmonte Garcia, left, from Spain and bronze medalist Rebecca Adlington from Britain . Emotional: With tears in her eyes, Ledecky waves from the podium after winning her gold medal . She went on: 'We don't have any expectations for her . at this meet. We want her to swim well. If she . makes the finals, we'll be thrilled because we'll have another event to . go and see her swim in.' Ledecky's mother said they never even imagined her daughter would make it to the Olympic trials - and was stunned when she actually qualified. 'We hadn't made any plans to come to London,' she said. When asked, before the race, what they would do with a medal if Ledecky won, her mother appeared taken aback at the possibility. 'I don't know,' she said. 'We haven't thought about that. She'd . probably show it to all of her friends.' VIDEO: Rebecca Adlington analyses her race against Katie Ledecky .","Katie Ledecky took gold in women's 800m freestyle in 8:14.63 .

Accused: Damian Rzeszowski visited a prostitute and had a one-night stand in the days before he killed six people, a court heard . A builder who knifed six people to death, including his wife and two young children, had visited a prostitute and had a one-night stand in the days before the killings, a court heard today. Damian Rzeszowski's marriage was under great strain after his wife Izabela Rzeszowska admitted to having a two-month affair with another man, the Royal Court in St Helier, Jersey, was told. The 31-year-old Polish defendant is accused of murdering Mrs Rzeszowska, 30, along with their daughter, Kinga, five, and two-year-old son, Kacper, in St Helier. He is also alleged to have murdered his wife’s father, Marek Garstka, 56, her friend, Marta De La Haye, 34, and Mrs De La Haye’s five-year-old daughter, Julia De La Haye. He has pleaded guilty to manslaughter through diminished responsibility, but the pleas were not accepted by the Crown. Prosecutors argue that Rzeszowski was not suffering an 'abnormality of the mind' when the attacks took place, on August 14 last year. Today the court heard that Rzeszowski and his family had returned from a holiday to Poland on the day of the killings. Rzeszowski had a one-night stand and visited a prostitute during the trip to his country. After returning from their trip, he got into a discussion with his wife for leaving the children on their own in the house. But the prosecution say that, rather than flying into an instant rage, Rzeszowski waited an hour and three-quarters before butchering his family and their visitors. The court heard he attacked his father-in-law first, catching him unawares while he watched Polish TV on his bed. Victims: Damian Rzeszowski is alleged to have murdered his five-year-old daughter Kinga (right) and two-year-old son Kacper (left) Siblings: Kinga (right) and Kacper Rzeszowski were killed by their father on August 14 last year . Family: The defendant, Damian Rzeszowski (right), pictured with his wife Izabela, daughter Kinga and son Kacper. He killed all three in a knife attack in August last year . Kacper was stabbed 13 times with two different kitchen knives while he played with his toys, and the two little girls were also stabbed numerous times. Mrs De La Haye, who had gone to the house with her daughter for a barbecue, staggered out into the street and collapsed outside the flat. Mrs Rzeszowska climbed through the bathroom window as she tried to escape her husband and made a 'desperate attempt' to call the police using her father’s mobile phone. She dialled 997, the Polish emergency services number, before being chased out into the street and stabbed again in front of neighbours. Rzeszowski then went back inside his home in Victoria Crescent and started stabbing himself before slumping to the ground with a collapsed lung. The court was shown the two kitchen knives that Rzeszowski used during the attacks. It also saw a painting that the children had been working on just before they were killed. 'Great strain': Damian Rzeszowski's marriage had been under pressure because his wife Izabela Rzeszowska (left) had admitted having an affair. Her father, Marek Garstka (right), was also killed . Stabbed: Mrs Rzeszowska's friend Marta De La Haye (left) and her daughter Julia (right) were the last two victims of the knife attack . Giving evidence today, consultant . psychiatrist Dr Dale Harrison told the court that Rzeszowski was haunted . by voices in his head. The . psychiatrist said that when he interviewed Rzeszowski five days after . the attacks he found no definitive symptoms of psychosis. But . after re-examining Rzeszowski when he returned to Jersey from being . treated in Broadmoor Hospital, Dr Harrison said: 'For the last week he . has continued to experience voices. 'These voices are related to stress he is under. Scene: The knife attack happened in the St Helier flat Damian Rzeszowski shared with his family . 'His stress levels are up since leaving Broadmoor Hospital and being put in prison.' In . the first interview Dr Harrison conducted with Rzeszowski on August 19 . last year, the defendant said he could not remember what had happened. Solicitor General Howard Sharp, for the prosecution, read from the notes the psychiatrist had written during the interview. No escape: Julia De La Haye and her mother Marta were visiting the Rzeszowskis' home when the fatal attacks occurred. The girl was stabbed numerous times . He read: 'Damian said ""I just remember the knife. I remember bits and pieces, going behind wife and running behind her"". 'He stated he did not remember attacking the children. He did remember his father-in-law and later running behind his wife.' At . another point in the interview, Rzeszowski told Dr Harrison: 'Everybody . gone, it is father-in-law, my wife, my wife’s friend and daughter. It . is me, I did that.' Rzeszowski also told the doctor that . he had had no previous thoughts of killing his family or anyone else . because he was not 'that type of man', although he later added: 'Maybe . when I was drunk or upset.' Yesterday, . the court heard that Rzeszowski claims to have blacked out after . cooking sausages at a barbecue at his family’s home before the attacks . took place. He had drunk several glasses of whisky on the day of the attacks but was under the drink-drive limit. Rzeszowski is currently taking anti-depressants and the anxiety-relieving drug Diazepam, the court was told. Since the trial started he has seemed absent in the dock, staring at the floor at all times. Killed: Julia De La Haye (left) Kinga (centre) and Kacper (right), pictured playing in the snow, were stabbed to death by Damian Rzeszowski .

Syrian rebels last night paraded what they claimed was the captured pilot of a government jet fighter. A video distributed by a group called the Revolutionary Youth of the Land of the Euphrates shows the pilot surrounded by three armed men. They claimed the pilot was a man called Mufid Mohammed Suleiman. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Captured: Syrian rebels last night paraded what they claimed was the captured pilot of a government jet fighter. This image made from amateur video purports to show Mufid Mohammed Suleiman . The footage shows the man (pictured) being questioned. He reports that he was on a mission to bomb the city of Mohassan . It came hours after they said a MiG fighter jet had been brought down by rebels close to the Iraqi border. None of the claims were independently verified. ‘My mission was to bomb the town of Muhasen’ in Deir Ezzor, said the suspected pilot, who has a beard and is wearing a dark blue shirt and was seated at a table. ‘The wounds on my face were caused by the strong wind that forced me on to stones after I ejected from my plane,’ he said. ‘The revolutionaries have treated me well and they gave me first aid assistance,’ he said. ‘They are good people.’ In the same video, a uniformed man introduced himself as Abul Laith, leader of the group of rebels. ‘We will treat this prisoner in accordance with our religion and our ethics and the Geneva Convention on the treatment of prisoners’, he says. Held: The video distributed by a group called the Revolutionary Youth of the Land of the Euphrates shows the pilot surrounded by three armed men . In the video, the man claiming to be a pilot says the bruises on his face are from when he crashed to the ground . Video was also released of the moment the Soviet-made plane was allegedly brought down. However, Syrian state-run media said the pilot ejected from the warplane after a technical failure. SANA news agency said the plane was on a training mission when a ‘technical failure occurred’ and the pilot had to eject. It added that a search was under way to find the pilot. ‘Yes, we can confirm that a MiG 21 has been downed,’ said Free Syrian Army spokesman Kassem Saadeddine. ‘It was hit with a 14.5 calibre anti-aircraft machinegun.’ If the rebels have indeed managed to shoot down a fighter jet and capture the pilot, it would mark a major leap forward in their military capabilities as well as a big blow to the regime, which started using its air force intensively in the civil war over the past weeks. The Syrian opposition has been calling for a no-fly zone over Syria for months. The eastern, oil-rich region near the border with Iraq has been witnessing heavy clashes between government troops and rebels over the past week. Syrian Prime Minister Riad Hijab, who defected to Jordan earlier this month, comes from the region. Jet's last moments: Rebels filmed this government fighter jet which state media said was experiencing 'technical problems'. Rebels claim they shot it down . Shot down: In the footage anti-aircraft can be heard just before the jet bursts into flames. Rebels are then heard celebrating . Apparent atrocities: Unconfirmed footage shows bodies being thrown off a building in Aleppo as the Syrian conflict becomes increasingly violent . Activists say more than 20,000 people have been killed since the revolt began in March 2011. More than 4,000 people have fled into Turkey in the past few day, bringing to 60,000 the number who have escaped over that border. Video of the pilot came after horrifying footage of rebels hurling bodies off a building in Aleppo emerged -  raising concerns that the conflict in Syria is becoming increasingly violent. Three unconfirmed videos posted online today show apparent atrocities in Aleppo and include footage of postal workers’ bodies being thrown from a roof and a bound man being repeatedly shot. Syrian Observatory for Human Rights director Rami Abdel Rahman said that if the videos were verified, he strongly condemned such atrocities regardless of who was responsible. Mr Rahman told AFP: ‘If these videos are confirmed, such atrocities harm the revolution. 'They only benefit the regime and the enemies of the revolution.’ The new allegations are the latest in the 17-month conflict where both sides have been accused of human rights violations. In one of the videos, the man filming said: ‘These are the heroes of Bab city who are inside the post office.’ As the crowd gathers, people shout ‘this is a shabiha’, which refers to the pro-government militia, as a man’s body is thrown from the roof. The bodies are said to be postal workers but it is unclear when the incident occurred. As fighting in Aleppo continues, rebels say they will turn Syria’s largest city into the 'grave' of the Assad government. Thousands have now fled, with those left running short of food and fuel and afraid for their lives. Another amateur video shows a . blindfolded man, whose throat is cut repeatedly by an assailant with a . small knife. His blood spreads across the pavement as a group of men . chant ‘Allahu Akbar’ which means 'God is greater'. Both sides accused: As rebels vow to turn Aleppo into the 'grave' of the Assad government, both sides have been accused of committing horrific atrocities during the 17 month conflict . Bodies thrown: Crowds gather as bodies are thrown, crashing down on stairs in Aleppo. The footage has not been confirmed and it is unclear when the incident occurred . Shouting crowd: In the footage, people shout 'this is a shabiha', which refers to the pro-government militia, can be heard as the bodies fall .","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

Vicious: Nathan McDonald was one of three masked raiders who pistol-whipped Richard Barnfather when robbing his £1million home . A businessman pistol-whipped by thieves in his home told yesterday of his betrayal as it emerged one of the thugs was a car valet he had employed for four years. Nathan McDonald, who was jailed yesterday for almost ten years for his role in the raid, had even visited millionaire Richard Barnfather’s home the day before the gang struck to wash his £190,000 Aston Martin. During the terrifying attack on his home, Mr Barnfather’s fiancee Deborah Leadbetter was beaten and throttled, and her head smashed against a wall. The four-strong gang escaped . separately in the couple’s silver Aston Martin DBS, a black Range Rover . Vogue and a silver Mercedes SLK convertible, worth a combined £280,000. They also stole jewellery worth £50,000. Sentencing McDonald yesterday, Mr . Justice Robin Onions described the raid on Mr Barnfather’s £1million . isolated barn conversion as the ‘stuff of nightmares’ which had featured . ‘gratuitous, completely unnecessary violence’. Outside court, Mr Barnfather – who . owns the country’s largest independent wire manufacturer, Barnfather . Wire Ltd, based in Darlaston, West Midlands – said McDonald had visited . his home to clean his cars ‘numerous times’ over the previous four . years. ‘We made him welcome and gave him cups of tea but he has carried out a total betrayal of our trust and confidence,’ he added. The court heard how McDonald, 22, met . Mr Barnfather during a track day at the Le Mans race circuit in northern . France, an event hosted by the businessman’s favourite marque, Aston . Martin. On the night of the attack, said . Sharon Bahia, prosecuting, the couple first realised someone was outside . their home when their dog began to bark. Ordeal: Richard Barnfather and his fiancee Deborah Leadbetter on holiday in Switzerland before McDonald and his accomplices raided their home . The men raided the home (forensic officers pictured at the scene) in the village of Pattingham, Shropshire, and made off with three luxury cars and jewellery worth more than £40,000 . When Mr Barnfather, 48, went . downstairs to investigate, three of the gang used a large plant pot to . smash their way in through the front door. After being threatened with an . imitation firegun, the businessman was taken ‘by the scruff of the neck’ to the kitchen and pistol-whipped. His 38-year-old fiancee – who was . dressed in just a nightie and a pair of knickers – was confronted in a . bedroom by two of the thieves. Miss Bahia said: ‘She only had a . nightie on. The men started touching her, lifting up her nightie and . patting her on the backside.’ The couple were bound with cable ties . and beaten, and Mr Barnfather was forced to hand over cash, an expensive . watch and the car keys, while other members of the gang began rifling . through drawers. They eventually made off in the pair’s three cars. The couple raised the alarm after . driving to a neighbour’s property in a fourth vehicle they owned. Within . hours of the incident at Lower Rudge, Shropshire, on March 9, the . vehicles, which were all fitted with tracking devices, were found . abandoned in Wolverhampton, eight miles away. Stolen: Richard Barnfather was hit over the head with a gun during the raid. The gang stole these two expensive watches during the robbery . Luxury: This is the Aston Martin DBS which was stolen from Richard Barnfather . Terrifying: McDonald and two other men raided Richard Barnfather's home and made off with three luxury cars and jewellery worth more than £40,000 . However, £45,700 of jewellery – . including Miss Leadbetter’s £25,000 engagement ring, which the gang . demanded immediately after confronting her – has still not been . recovered. McDonald was arrested a month after the attack, after police . matched his DNA to blood spots found in both the Range Rover and the . Mercedes. Officers also discovered an imitation . pistol at his Wolverhampton home, which matched a magazine cartridge . left at the scene. Shrewsbury Crown Court heard that although McDonald . admitted robbery and possession of an imitation firearm, he denied that . he had ever entered the house. However, he was sentenced on the basis . of ‘joint enterprise’ – meaning a group can be convicted of a crime . committed by just one or more of its members. The three other gang members remain at . large. Mr Justice Onions added: ‘It seems clear that armed with the . knowledge acquired through valeting you knew Mr Barnfather was a man of . means. ‘You forced entry to the property and . you knew what the occupiers owned - you made reference to the ring. This . was planned, targeted and professional offending.’ Mr Barnfather said his fiancee, a . former marketing manager, has been plagued by nightmares and the couple . have postponed their wedding, which was due to have taken place next . month. Expensive: This diamond ring worth £25,000 was also stolen during the 'frightening' raid . A Mercedes SLK similar to this was stolen together with two other cars . He said the pair have since sold their . home, Range Rover and Aston Martin. The Mercedes was also recovered, . but was written off after being badly damaged. Detective inspector Mark Bellamy, of . West Mercia Police, said McDonald and the gang were guilty of a . ‘particularly vicious attack on a couple in their own home’. A £14,000 reward for information . leading to the conviction of those responsible, including £10,000 put up . by Mr Barnfather, remains.","Nathan McDonald, 22, who was one of four-strong gang who conducted a violent raid on millionaire's house, jailed for nine years and eight months .

While many like to whinge about the recent rain, sunflower farmers were more than pleased with the changeable weather. In a single field, a bumper crop of 100,000 sunflowers have grown to five foot tall as they saluted the sun when it appeared after weeks of rain. The field of yellow at Cadwell Farm in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, has grown so tall this year that a person can literally disappear as they wade through them. Bumper crop: Maria Hunter wades through this field of sunflowers which have grown five foot tall, higher than usual thanks to the weeks of rain followed by dry weather . Tim Hunter, who helps run the farm, said the blooms usually only grow four foot high but the heavy rain earlier this year has helped their huge growth spurt. He said: ‘We’ve got a real bumper crop this year. ‘We planted them in May, then it rained continuously for three months so the flowers have really flourished. ‘The sun over the last few weeks has made them open up and the field is now looking amazing.’ Visitors who come to the farm to pick sunflowers have been stunned by the height of the beautiful blooms, Mr Hunter said. Blooming weather: While the changeable weather has been great for sunflowers, rain is predicted across most of the country for the Bank Holiday weekend . Stunned visitors: At Cadwell Farm in Hitchin, Hertfordshire visitors can pick sunflowers from the field and have been stunned by the height of the beautiful blooms . The forecast for the Bank Holiday weekend is set to be changeable too with predictions for showers across much of the country on Friday and Saturday. It is expected to improve on Sunday and by Monday the sun should be out. Charlie Powell from the Met Office said: ‘It is looking like a real mixed bag. He said South East of the country should get the best of the weather this weekend. The rugby league Challenge Cup at Wembley, horse-racing at Cheltenham, the Reading and Leeds music festivals and the Notting Hill carnival are among the events set to be affected. Some areas have already had a taste of what’s to come, with thunderstorms and rain causing flash-flooding on Tuesday. Flash flooding: Earlier this week, motorists in Ramsbottom, Lancashire were left in deluge as heavy rains flooded roads within 20 minutes . Motorists in Ramsbottom, Lancashire, found themselves driving through several feet of water as clouds unleashed huge amounts of rain in just 20 minutes. While the mix of dry and wet weather has spelled good news for sunflowers but bad news for motorists stuck in flash flooding, it has also been bad news for some fruit and vegetable crops with a surge in fungal and bacterial diseases. Fungi such as black spot on roses and bacteria that causes disease on cherry and plum trees have spread because of the unpredictable weather according to the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS). Guy Barter, the chief horticultural advisor at RHS said: ‘It has been difficult getting out to the garden over the past few months because of the rain. ‘One of the important things to do is to remove as much dead and infected material as possible. ‘Once you have reduced the amount of infected material any spraying with an appropriate fungicide will be especially effective.’ Unpredictable weather: The heavy rain that fell earlier this weekend could be repeated with more wet weather forecast for Friday and Saturday .","The recent rain followed by dry weather has allowed a sunflower crop to grow 5ft tall .

While some sufferers swear by a bracelet, others use expensive insoles. Johnny Franks, however, reckons he’s found the cheapest aid of all – 2p pieces glued to the inside of his shoes. Happy man: Johnny Franks, 85 , a retired performer, is celebrating being able to walk again after supergluing two pence coins to the inside of his shoes . The 85-year-old has been crippled by arthritis for 15 years and could barely bend his knees without feeling excruciating pain. But he had a flash of inspiration after reading about the apparent benefits of walking on copper. Unable to afford the £30 cost of . specially made insoles, he came up with his own version by glueing four . 2p pieces to a cheap shoe protector. Those 2p coins minted before 1992 are 97 per cent copper. Only four weeks later, the father of two – who was an entertainer during World War Two – claims he has been ‘cured’. He said: 'At first my arthritis came and went, but in the last couple of years it got really bad. 'I thought “I wonder whether the copper in 2p pieces could help me?” After a few weeks I thought “wow, this really works”. 'Now walking is a pleasure and I can move around unlike before. 'I am walking without any pain and I can lift my leg half way up my body and kick out.' Cheap and cheerful: Mr Franks has put 8p in each shoe and is reaping the rewards . Mr Franks, of Stanmore, North London, . was a teenager during the war and travelled around Army barracks in the . UK and Italy performing the violin and singing as part of the . Entertainments National Service Association. After marrying his wife of 61 years . Nanette, 81, he went on to run his own business selling jukebox records, . before retiring and filling his time with charity work. Mr Franks lost his mobility when he . developed arthritis in 1997 and was left struggling to bend his knees . without being in terrible pain. When he saw the advert for copper . insoles he tried putting 2p pieces in his socks – but the coins . uncomfortably moved around. He later came up with the idea of . glueing them on to some £3 insoles. Copper is an essential nutrient for . the body and critical for bone development and nerve function. At least 20 per cent of the population . suffers from copper deficiency, particularly older people.

Grieving: Jeremy Clarkson named and shamed people who sent him vile messages when he revealed that his beloved dog Whoopi, right, a black Labrador, had died last month . He wrote in this month’s Top Gear . magazine: ‘A few moments ago my dog died, and, as an experiment, I . announced the fact on Twitter. Now, everyone must have known that when a . family pet is put down, the family in question is bound to be upset. So . you’d expect a bit of sympathy. And, in America, that’s what you’d get.

But the 29-year-old has more reason than most to feel blessed by Ethan’s safe arrival – because he is the child she was afraid it would be impossible for her to have. Miss Brown and her partner Adam Holtby, 28, were planning to get married and start a family when their world was turned upside down two years ago. Blessed with child: Katie Brown and partner Adam Holtby were relieved when baby Ethan arrived safely after she was diagnosed with cervical cancer two years ago . Following a routine smear test, Miss Brown was diagnosed with cervical cancer and warned she could die without a hysterectomy. But, distraught that she would never be able to have children of her own, she was offered the chance to undergo pioneering surgery to save both her life and her fertility. The operation, which has been performed on just a handful of British women, was a success. To her doctor’s amazement, Miss Brown became pregnant six months later and Ethan was born by Caesarean section weighing a healthy 7lb 11oz. Miss Brown, a dental hygienist, said: ‘Holding Ethan in my arms for the first time was the most amazing feeling ever, it was the best day of my life. It was very, very emotional. I was in tears, Adam was crying, even some of the doctors and nurses were blubbing, it was very special. 'Little miracle': Miss Brown underwent pioneering surgery to save her life from cervical cancer and her fertility and to her doctor's amazement Miss Brown fell pregnant with Ethan within six months . ‘To be told I had cancer and that I may never be a mother was heartbreaking, but then to be given this chance and to manage to get through the pregnancy and birth with a healthy little boy – we are just over the moon. ‘People say Ethan is a happy little boy, . but we are just so pleased to have him. We look at him every day and . can’t quite believe he’s here. He’s our little miracle.’ Radical surgery: Miss Brown had a pioneering procedure devised at Hammersmith Hospital, pictured, and the Lister Hospital . Miss Brown was diagnosed with cervical cancer in September 2010. Doctors warned her that it was likely that she would need a hysterectomy to save her life. But, by chance, her consultant knew a doctor pioneering a little known procedure, known as a radical abdominal trachelectomy. The operation, devised by doctors at Hammersmith Hospital and the Lister Hospital, both in London, involves most of the cervix – the muscle which holds a baby in the womb – being removed, together with the upper part of the vagina. The womb and the upper opening of the cervix, where it joins on to the womb, are left behind and rejoined to the vagina. A stitch is then inserted on to the upper opening of the cervix to hold a baby in place in the womb until it is ready to be delivered. ‘The doctors explained that I could have a hysterectomy or radiotherapy but I knew both would rob me of my fertility,’ Miss Brown, who lives with Mr Holtby, an IT research analyst, in Brough, East Yorkshire, said. ‘This new operation seemed like a much better option. The consultant told me only a handful of women in the UK had had the surgery but it had a good success rate.’ If the doctors had discovered during the . operation that the cancer had spread they might still have had to . perform a hysterectomy. But fortunately, that didn’t happen. Delayed wedding plans: The couple put their wedding on hold and began trying for a baby six months after the successful operation . Miss Brown and Mr Holtby put their wedding plans on hold and began trying for a baby six months after the successful operation at Castle Hill Hospital, Cottingham, East Yorkshire, in November 2010. She became pregnant almost immediately, in May last year, and after a normal pregnancy, Ethan was born by a planned C-section at 38 weeks in February. ‘When I was diagnosed with cancer I’d thought I’d lost my chance to have children, but having Ethan was made possible thanks to this amazing surgery,’ added Miss Brown, who is in remission from her cancer. ‘I just want other women to know that having a hysterectomy is not the only option if you have cancer, I’m proof that fertility can be preserved and miracles do happen.’","Katie Brown was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2010 .

Double standards: Inspector Mohammed Razaq, 52, was responsible for evicting anti-social tenants - but his own property was the scene of drinking, violence and drug-taking . A senior policeman who ran a 'zero tolerance' crackdown on nightmare tenants owned a house that became notorious for wild parties, drug taking and violence. While Inspector Mohammed Razaq, 52, was fighting to evict thugs from a council estate in Bolton, Greater Manchester, his ten-bedroom house five miles away had descended into chaos. Neighbours created a dossier of 49 incidents in which drunken tenants at the Victorian townhouse had thrown bricks at them in the street and jumped up and down on cars. One recalled how feral dogs belonging to the 'house from hell' would roam the street and an occasion when a woman threatened to throw herself from the second floor. Meanwhile, Insp Razaq was acting as a figurehead for a major police operation attempting to reduce anti-social behaviour including street drinking and vandalism. Now the Asbo laws he uses on his own beat have been called upon to have his house in Higher Broughton, near Salford, boarded up and the tenants moved on. A neighbour said today: 'Closing down that house will give us our first good nights sleep for several years. 'He may have been been the public face . of policing anti social behaviour on his beat but it is an absolute . disgrace that he can’t keep his own house in order - literally. 'There were always late night parties . going on there and at one time there was a woman threatening to jump . from the second floor. They had feral dogs roaming around the . neighbourhood and attacking other animals. 'At times the tenants themselves would . jump on my car and throw bricks out the window. It was a house from hell . - and I find it unbelievable it is owned by a senior police officer who . should know better.' Insp Razaq - one of Britain’s longest serving Asian officers and known as 'Mo' - has more than 33 years experience, including spells in CID, Tactical Aid, a firearms unit and on community cohesion projects. During the 1980s, he helped to police the Toxteth riots, and was part of the team which escorted the Moors Murderer Myra Hindley back to the Saddleworth Moor to locate victims’ bodies. He was eventually put in charge of policing the Johnson Fold estate in Bolton, where he introduced extra high visibility police patrols and more CCTV surveillance. Groups of youths were regularly stopped and asked to account for what they were doing. His use of dispersal orders helped cut anti-social behaviour in the area by a third. Insp Razaq was a regular at local area meetings and warned that problem tenants would be thrown out of their homes if they repeatedly brought misery to the community. After one eviction, Insp Razaq, who lives in the Great Lever area of Bolton, said: 'There has been a lot of anti-social behaviour, alcohol-fuelled problems and this house was the focal point. 'We’re sending out a strong message that if people engage in anti-social behaviour they can expect low-levels of tolerance from the police. We will do all we can to resolve the problem and if that means evicting people, then so be it.' Black-spot: The ten-bedroom house was boarded up by the council after neighbours recorded almost 50 incidents of trouble from tenants . But Insp Razaq had problems at his own property, for which his son Usman holds the landlord licence. Manchester City Magistrates' Court was told of almost 50 incidents involving tenants of the house between July last year and June this year. They included loud music being played at night, foul language, fights and repeated thefts from neighbours’ houses and the local shop. A dog from the house also mauled a passer-by. Salford City Council won a three-month closure order on the house after their legal application was supported by Insp Razaq’s colleagues at Greater Manchester Police. They said the property had a 'high turnover' of tenants and issues dated back to 2009. A council spokesman said: 'The Anti-Social Behaviour Team received reports of residents and their guests drinking at the front of the property, shouting, arguing, fighting, shop lifting from the local shop and even stealing from other residents at the address. 'There were also reports of rubbish being dumped around the property, dogs allowed to roam around and on one occasion of a dog attacking a passer-by. 'A meeting was called with all tenants to warn them of the implications of their behaviour. Serious problem: Magistrates heard that rubbish was dumped outside the house and neighbours' homes were burgled . 'When none of the tenants attended, Anti-Social Behaviour Officers then tried to work with the owner of the property to resolve the problem, but when this failed they took the decision to apply for a closure order.' Salford deputy mayor David Lancaster said: 'A trouble-making group of residents like this can terrorise a local community. 'In this particular case, local residents were left feeling threatened and unsafe in their own community, which is absolutely unacceptable. 'The work the Anti-Social Behaviour Team has done will move these individuals out of this house, meaning they can no longer pose a threat to this area. I hope this will also make the tenants see the error of their ways and make sure there is not a repeat of this behaviour in future.' The case is the first time an Asbo has been served on a property in Greater Manchester rather than an individual. Insp Razaq said he had been the victim of a ‘witch hunt’ on the evidence of just one witness. He said he and his son had fully complied with everything council officers had asked of them. Insp Razaq is currently suspended on full pay from his post after being arrested in May 2011 on suspicion of unrelated allegations of corruption and fraud. He was cleared of any wrongdoing on duty but was charged with six offences of fraud and three offences under the Proceeds of Crime Act relating to insurance and mortgage fraud. It is alleged he exaggerated insurance claims following flood damage at his house and secured a mortgage at a lower rate by failing to disclose that he was buying to let. He will 'strenuously' deny all charges and is awaiting trial.","Neighbours said Inspector Razaq's tenants threw bricks at them and jumped on cars .

Britain's nuclear defence is under threat because the Navy will not have enough people to properly man its submarines, it was warned today. Trident subs and UK boats holding nuclear weapons may have to stay in port as a result of staff shortages, internal Submarines Service documents reveal. The Ministry of Defence's official risk register says engineer numbers will also be down by 15 per cent within three years, causing even more problems for the British fleet. Problems: Vessels like Britain's top submarine HMS Vanguard, pictured, may be understaffed, an official report reveals . One in seven weapons officer posts ranked at lieutenant will also be vacant in the coming years, meaning there may not be enough people to fire weapons. The Royal Navy is desperately trying to bolster its number of 'experienced' mid-level staff on its six attack submarines and four large Vanguard boats that carry our Trident nuclear weapons. 'There is a risk that the Royal Navy will not have sufficient suitably . qualified and experienced personnel to be able to support the manning . requirement of the submarine fleet.' the document says. Anger: Trident has caused a great deal of protest, CND activists pictured here in Parliament Square, and its replacement programme could be threatened by a lack of experienced staff, documents warn . 'Inability to recruit, retain and develop sufficient nuclear and . submarine design qualified personnel will result in an inability to . support the Defence Nuclear Programme,' it also warned. Questioning Britain's ability to replace the controversial Trident missiles it said they are worried about the 'erosion of manufacturing capability, cost growth, time delay, and poor performance of contractors'. Concerns: Admiral West,of Spithead says the the Royal Navy must prepare for any staffing problems now . There are currently 5,000 Navy submariners but at the moment some vessels are going out for tours with only 85 per cent of its staff capacity filled. The Ministry of Defence is busy trying to find out how to attract and keep more staff as so many will spend up to four months without leaving the submarine. Admiral Lord West today called the situation 'worrying' and that the . Navy must have procedures in place to cope with any staff shortages. 'There’s no doubt that recruiting and keeping highly qualified nuclear engineers has been tough. Nuclear engineers have also become highly sought-after by the civil industry as this country has not trained enough,' he told the Telegraph. The Risk Register was handed to the Nuclear Information Service. Director Peter Burt told the Telegraph: 'These risks highlight major pitfalls ahead and that Trident replacement is far from a forgone conclusion. How effective we are at mastering these risks will determine whether Britain can remain in the nuclear weapons business.' But the MoD today told MailOnline they were not worried about the situation. 'This report recognises that the Royal Navy has sufficient manpower for its submarines and we are confident that this will remain the case,' a Royal Navy spokesman said. 'The MoD is committed to sustaining the highest safety standards and to maintaining the defence industrial supply chain to design, build and support the nuclear fleet.'","Government 'risk register' says they will be short on experienced staff to man the British fleet .

As he begged outside Brooklyn synagogues, Howard Frank was always regaling people with stories of his past, proudly referring to his distant esteemed rabbi relatives. But suddenly Frank's tales took a much more sinister turn – he told friends - and anyone who'd listen - that someone was out to kill him and that he urgently needed thousands of dollars. He even started saying his farewells to friends. Scroll down for video . Mystery: Homicide detectives are investigating the mysterious death of Howard Franks, seen left, who begged for money outside Brooklyn synagogues. Franks was the proud owner of a vast collection of vintage photos with an estimated value of $1 million . However, as he was always a bit strange, people simply dismissed his frantic behaviour and wild tales. 'He’d say that someone is out to kill him. He said he needed $17,000 right away,' a  friend, Abie Maltz, told the New York Post. On June 28, Frank was discovered floating face down in Brooklyn's Gowanus Canal. The NYPD said 55-year-old’s death was not a homicide and began investigating it as a suicide or an accident. Already shrouded in mystery, Frank's death became all the more mysterious as it turned out that the beggar was sitting on a vast collection of entertainment photographs - worth an estimated $1 million. Bizarre: Howard Franks started telling friends and family that he someone was out to kill him and he owed them thousands of dollars. Franks was found floating face down in a Brooklyn canal on June 28; NYPD began investigating his death as a suicide or accident . Collected over his lifetime, the photos were of TV and film stars from the 1950s to the 1990s. The eccentric beggar would reportedly rather buy photos than food and it is thought his collection reached 1 million. His pictures of comedienne Lucille Ball - his favourites and the most valuable - alone numbered tens of thousands. Friends and family said Frank needed cash to pay off storage fees, as he kept his massive collection of photos in a warehouse. However, a friend of his - Henry Hewes - told the New York Post that he had been paying the storage fees for the last five years with the agreement that when the photo collection was brought – or Frank died – he would be paid. About a week before he died, Frank put a lien for $78,000 on his photo collection to cover his storage fee debts. Suicide? Friends and family say that Franks was scared of water and would not have killed himself; he was found dead in the Gowanus Canal on June 28 . On the night of June 27, Frank left the Landau synagogue much earlier than usual, members told PIX11. His business partner of recent years, Frank Pohole, had let the collector stay at his home. He said that Frank never made it back to the apartment that night. Pohole suggested to PIX11 that Frank may have been killed after crossing the wrong rabbi because he was controversially sharing information about Brooklyn’s Satmar Hasidic community with others. Robert Frank, who spoke to the Post, also thinks that his brother may have angered the wrong rabbi or loan sharks in a bid to own his photos outright - free from Hewes. Many say Frank would never kill himself and testify that he was terrified of water. Investigators found that Frank's lungs were full of water – showing that he was still alive when he entered the canal. However, some of Frank's acquaintances believe he did kill himself – pointing out that he was forced to close his photo shop following the economic downturn after 9/11 and had to leave his apartment. NYPD spokesman Sgt John Buthorn told the MailOnline that there was 'no apparent criminality at this time' in Frank's death. Shelter: Having lost his photo shop and his home, Frank's business partner - Frank Pohole - let him stay with him in his Sunset Park apartment . Collection: Frank had about one million photos including tens of thousands of the late comedienne, Lucille Ball; pictured here with her husband Desi Arnaz. Frank's vast collection was worth an estimated $1 million . The Medical Examiner’s Office did not conduct an autopsy – reportedly on the family’s orders – as autopsies are typically against Jewish law. The Examiner’s office are now relying on crime-scene photographs and X-rays to try and determine the cause of death, Ellen Borakove, an Office spokeswoman told the Post. And whether Frank’s death was an accident, or if he committed suicide at the prospect of losing his photos or was killed after crossing the wrong people will be all the harder to determine with no autopsy. 'The manner of death might be undetermined if there isn’t enough evidence,' Borakove said. Watch video here .","Howard Franks begged outside Brooklyn synagogues and was known to be an eccentric .

Two inmates serving time for a 1995 murder that some investigators now believe they didn’t commit will stay behind bars after a judge rejected plans to immediately free them. Eric Glisson and Cathy Watkins, who've been in prison for 17 years, are among five people whose convictions in the killing a Bronx livery cab driver are now being re-examined due to new evidence linking the murder to two gang members. The Bronx District Attorney had agreed on a plan to release Glisson and Wakins to house arrest, but Bronx Judge Efrain Alvarado rejected that option on Friday, reported the New York Post. Imprisoned: Eric Glisson was convicted in the 1995 killing of a livery cab driver in New York City but new evidence suggests the murder was carried out by gang members; Glisson was rejected bail on Friday, he is pictured right with his lawyer, Peter Cross, left . The judge says he has no power to grant bail to someone serving a sentence that hasn't been overturned. 'There’s no provision under the law to make a bail application at this point, when a defendant is still serving a sentence,' state court spokesman David Bookstaver told the Post. The bail rejection came after prosecutors had arranged for Glisson and Watkins to have electronic monitoring bracelets so they could enjoy freedom for the first time in 17 years, reported the Post. Fighting for freedom: Glisson wrote to federal prosecutors saying he'd heard the murder was the work of a gang called Sex, Money and Murder . Glisson’s lawyer, Peter Cross told the Post of his frustration at the decision. ‘To say the least, I was extremely disappointed that the court — seeing that the district attorney was willing to do this — refused to exercise the power that we certainly think it has to do justice,' Cross said. Glisson and Watkins are among five people convicted in the murder of livery cab driver Baith Diop, who was gunned down on January 19, 1995, amid a rash of taxi driver murders around New York City. Press accounts had described how, according to police, the Senegalese immigrant begged for his life before being shot in the back and neck. Ballistics showed that he was shot with two .38-caliber handguns that were never recovered. Rather than treat the crime as a fatal holdup, New York Police Department detectives and prosecutors linked it to a complex conspiracy by a band of drug dealers involved in the execution-style killing of FedEx executive Denise Raymond two days earlier. Investigators alleged that Diop was killed as part of a related scheme to steal a pile of drug money that one of his passengers was carrying that night. At the first of two trials, three men were convicted in both the killing of Denise Raymond and Diop. At the second, a jury found Glisson and Watkins guilty in the cabbie homicide. All received lengthy sentences. Glisson's lawyer said that as the years passed, his client exhausted all his appeals before writing a letter to federal prosecutors. In it, he said he had heard that the cabbie killing was the work of a gang called Sex, Money and Murder or SMM. The letter, though addressed to a prosecutor who had left the office, by coincidence made its way into the hands of John O’Malley - a former Bronx homicide detective familiar with SMM, the New York Times reported. Jailed: Glisson has been behind bars at Sing Sing prison for 17 years; it is now thought he was wrongfully convicted of murder . The names of Gilbert Vega and Jose Rodriguez, two SMM members, rang a bell for O'Malley. Both men had confessed to killing a Bronx cab driver in late 1994 or early 1995 – an admission that couldn't be corroborated at the time. Vega and Rodriguez confessed after becoming cooperators in 2003. The investigator re-interviewed the two men. They described again how they were riding in a cab together when they decided to rob the driver. When he put up a fight, they shot him and jumped out of the car without knowing whether he was dead. Earlier this month, Glisson and Watkins filed court papers to have their convictions thrown out. Their next court hearing is scheduled for October 19. 'Deep down, I feel like the justice system failed me,' Glisson said in an interview earlier this month. 'But you just have to try to move on.'","Eric Glisson and Cathy Watkins convicted for the 1995 murder of cab driver Baith Diop .

A Virginia gay activist has been charged in federal court in the shooting of a security guard at the headquarters of a conservative Christian lobbying group. Federal authorities say Floyd Lee Corkins II told a guard at the Family Research Council, 'I don't like your politics' before shooting him in the arm. The guard and others helped subdue Corkins, who was taken into custody. He's been charged with assault with intent to kill and with bringing a firearm across state lines. Authorities found a box of ammunition and 15 Chick-fil-A sandwiches in his backpack. Scroll down for video . Under arrest: Police say Floyd Corkins II, walked into the Family Research Council's headquarters in Washington, DC's Chinatown area with Chick-fil-A items and shot a guard . Local and federal investigators work to gather evidence after a security guard was shot in the arm at the headquarters of the Family Research Council August 15, 2012 in Washington, DC. At . approximately 10.45 a.m. on Wednesday morning  28-year-old Floyd . Corkins II, walked into the Family Research Council's (FRC) headquarters . in Washington, DC's Chinatown area, made a statement, produced a gun . and then shot a security guard who tried to stop him. Corkins had been volunteering at a community center dedicated to gay, lesbian and transgendered people. The . guard was rushed to hospital while witnesses said that when the man was . disarmed, the suspect said, 'Don't shoot me, it was not about you, it . was what this place stands for.' David Mariner, the executive director of The DC Center for the LGBT Community, confirmed Corkins had been volunteering at the center for about the past 6 months. Mariner described Corkins as 'kind, gentle and unassuming.' While police have not yet stated what motivated Corkins, a coalition of 25 gay rights groups released a statement through GLAAD condemning the shooting. 'The motivation and circumstances behind today's tragedy are still unknown, but regardless of what emerges as the reason for this shooting, we utterly reject and condemn such violence. Local and federal investigators work to gather evidence after a security guard was shot in the arm at the headquarters of the Family Research Council August 15, 2012 in Washington, DC. 'We wish for a swift and complete recovery for the victim of this terrible incident,' the statement read.' The Family Research Council is a . right-wing, conservative lobbying organisation that is against abortion, . euthanasia and same-sex marriages. Speaking today after Corkin's was charged, the FRC President Tony Perkins spoke of his 'appreciation' of support from groups that might not necessarily agree with his groups viewpoint. He called for a stop to the 'endless rhetoric' that he believed caused the Family Research Council shooting. 'The . police are investigating this incident,' said FRC President Tony . Perkins in a statement yesterday. 'Our first concern is with our colleague who was . shot today. Our concern is for him and his family.' The council was also recently in the news when Mr. Perkins defended Chick-fil-A chief executive Dan Cathy's public comments that were perceived as critical of gay marriage. Cathy, the president of the . multimillion-dollar empire said in an interview with the conservative . paper Baptist Press last month that his company is ‘very much supportive . of the family,’ but only when it involves heterosexual couples.

His comments sparked outrage among gay and lesbian groups across the country, with many holding protests and 'kiss-ins' at Chick-fil-A restaurants. Perkins later spoke out in support of Cathy, saying: 'All . Chick-fil-A did was refuse to be bullied by the politically correct . crowd.' Local and federal investigators work to gather evidence after a security guard was shot in the arm at the headquarters of the Family Research Council . The former president of the Family Research Council and former . Republican presidential candidate, Gary Bauer also said at the time: 'The values of the Family .

'The . security guard was struck, is right now receiving treatment and is in . stable condition. The security guard and others wrestled the suspect . down to the ground and he is in custody.' It is thought that the security guard was shot in the arm and was conscious and breathing when he was taken to hospital. 'The security guard here is a hero, as far as I’m concerned,' said Chief Lanier. 'He did his job. The person never made it past the front.' According to Fox News, the suspect 'made statements regarding their policies and then opened fire with a gun striking a security guard.' As they began their investigation, federal authorities began treating the incident as a case of domestic terrorism. 'We don't know enough about him or . his circumstances to determine what his connection is to this group, . (The FRC) or his mental state, or what he was doing or thinking of . doing,' said James McJunkin, the head of the FBI's Washington Field . Office. Authorities recovered Corkin's car at a Virginia Metro station and then traveled to speak to neighbours who knew his family. 'They were always so sweet and nice,' said Stephanie Meyer, who lives nearby to the Corkin's Virginia home. 'They are awesome people. We never had any issues.' The White House said that President Obama was informed of the shooting while he was traveling in Iowa.

A disgraced Minnesota politician who had oral sex with a 17-year-old boy in a rest-stop dropped his re-election bid on Wednesday, admitting to what he called an 'obvious tragic embarrassment.' Rep. Kerry Gauthier, 56, had declared he would stay in the race in a statement released at 1pm yesterday despite party leaders and Republicans wanting him out, but he U-turned just hours later. The 56-year-old said he had been going back and forth about running 'every 20 minutes for a week' before making the decision, which he claims was not influenced by Democratic leaders pressing him to withdraw. Disgraced: Rep. Kerry Gauthier, pictured, dropped his re-election bid on Wednesday, admitting to what he called an 'obvious tragic embarrassment' 'I changed my mind,' he said. 'Too much. It's just too much.' Gauthier also said that he overdosed on muscle relaxants last week, leading to hospitalisation, in an effort to kill himself. He'd earlier issued a statement saying he has been in recovery from chemical dependency for 30 years with one relapse. Gauthier's decision to withdraw his re-election bid came after . Democratic leaders, from Gov. Mark Dayton on down, urged the first-term . lawmaker to step aside so the party could field another candidate in a . reliably Democratic district. Caught: Police revealed that a Minnesota's Representative Kerry Gauthier had a sexual encounter with a 17-year-old boy . Democrats need to gain at least six House seats to take control of the chamber, a top goal in November, and the last thing they needed was the possibility of losing what was thought to be a safe seat. State election officials have said Gauthier can't be replaced on the ballot, which would mean a write-in campaign for a replacement that would be much more difficult to win. But Democrats said earlier this week they were looking at legal avenues to replace Gauthier on the ballot if he dropped. Gauthier's initial decision to stay in the race, announced in an interview with Northland's NewsCenter in Duluth, drew widespread condemnation from fellow Democrats. Dayton said the move would be 'destructive' for Gauthier's reputation, his district, his party and the state. 'I think it's just something that goes beyond the morals of Minnesotans - to solicit on Craigslist sex with a minor and do it in a public area, publicly owned area, as a state legislator, and come back to the parking lot with his clothes disheveled,' Dayton told reporters at the Capitol. 'It's not about whether it's a same-sex or a heterosexual act. It would be the same if it were the same circumstances involving a heterosexual individual.' Police say Gauthier admitted having oral sex with the boy on July 22 after the first-term lawmaker from Duluth advertised on Craigslist for 'no strings attached' sex. Police declined to charge him because the boy was older than 16, the legal age of consent, and no money was exchanged. Earlier, Gauthier apologized for the incident in a statement posted online by the Duluth News Tribune.'I am sorry for the hurt this has caused my family, friends and my constituents. I know I made a mistake and am determined to make amends as best I can,' he said. Minnesota House Minority Leader Paul Thissen said in a statement to the Duluth News Tribune that he was 'deeply disappointed' with Gauthier’s conduct before the politician withdraw his ballot. 'The . conduct was wrong and no one in the DFL House caucus condones the . behavior,' he said. 'I expect he will address these issues publicly and . soon.' 'Too much': Rep. Kerry Gauthier, pictured, dropped his bid claiming running was 'too much' Previously, Republicans lobbied for his resignation. 'I believe we have given Rep. Gauthier and the Democrat caucus a respectful amount of time to address this situation on their own,' House Speaker Kurt Zellers, R-Maple Grove, said on Friday. 'Rep. Gauthier’s actions are not becoming of a member of the House of Representatives, and today I am calling on him to resign from the Legislature.' Mr Gauthier was treated for shortness of breath following the public investigation of his interactions with a 17-year-old teen he met on Craigslist. The two met for a rendezvous on July 22 at the Thompson Hill rest stop around 11 p.m. The Duluth News Tribune reported that a state trooper happened upon the pair after a report of 'suspicious activity.' Police reports of the incident reveal . that Mr Gauthier put out an ad for an encounter on Craigslist and the . 17-year-old responded. The . two walked to a wooded area behind the rest stop pavilion for five . minutes, where they engaged in oral sex and touching, police records . show. Bipartisan: House Minority Leader and fellow Democrat Paul Thissen, left, as well as House Speaker and Republican Kurt Zellers, right, have condemned Mr Gauthier's actions . A trooper approached Mr Gauthier on his way back from the encounter. 'It was at that time I noted his zipper was open and part of his shirt was hanging out. I asked him why his zipper was down and he said he didn’t know,' the officer wrote in his police report. 'I told him to zip it up and leave. The male seemed nervous.' Then, the trooper said, he saw the teen. 'He stated that he had met an older man at the rest area after corresponding with him in a response to a Craigslist ad,' the trooper wrote. The teen told the police that his parents were unaware of his sexual orientation and begged them not to tell his family of the incident. Both men said the interaction was consensual and there was no money exchanged. The teen also told police that he lied about his age, telling Mr Gauthier he was 18 years old. 'I think it’s a private matter and I don’t need to talk about it,' Mr Gauthier said to the Duluth News Tribune following the explosive investigation. 'It was at that time I noted his zipper . was open and part of his shirt was hanging out. I asked him why his . zipper was down and he said he didn’t know. I told him to zip it up and leave.' State Trooper . No charges were pressed against the representative as the age of consent is 16 in Minnesota. Gauthier told TV station his unwillingness to accept he is gay led him to the sex act in the rest-stop. He said he is getting counseling. He also said he feels badly for the teen and wouldn't talk specifically about the incident to protect the boy. 'I can change my behavior, but I cannot change the fact that I am a gay man, and have known this since my college days. I simply must act like a mature gay man would act, and not as the incident portrays me,' the network quoted him as saying. Gauthier said he won't attend a Friday special session to vote on a flood relief package after his district was one of the hardest-hit by June flash floods. Gauthier had pushed hard for state aid until he dropped out of public view when the scandal hit last week. 'I just think it would be a distraction for the city to get what it needs from the special session,' Gauthier said. Sen. Roger Reinert, a Democrat who shares a district with Gauthier, said the withdrawal was 'absolutely the right decision.' Reinert said Gauthier's presence in the campaign threatened to drag down Democratic attempts to win control of the Legislature. He said the scandal reinforced negative stereotypes of gay people, and could hurt an effort to defeat a proposed constitutional amendment on the November ballot banning gay marriage. Republican leaders called on Gauthier to resign immediately from his legislative seat, but Democrats did not make that request. Dayton said his signed agreement for the special session with top Republican and Democratic legislative leaders would preclude a House vote on Gauthier's conduct because it limits the scope of the special session. A spokeswoman for the GOP House caucus had no immediate comment. Duluth firefighter Erik Simonson launched a bid as a write-in Democratic candidate for Gauthier's seat Tuesday. Duluth City Councilor Jay Fosle also has filed paperwork to run as a write-in candidate. Republican Travis Silvers already is on the ballot.","Representative Kerry Gauthier was found engaging in oral sex on July 22 .

Investment bank Morgan Stanley say that the average UK household is already £50 worse off in 2012 and it will only get more painful, with a total fall in disposable income of £1.3 billlion this year, reaching £5 billion by the end of 2013. It came after a difficult few weeks for consumers who are already seeing their monthly costs rising at an eye-watering rate. Only last week SSE, the UK's second biggest energy provider, bumped up its gas and electricity prices by nine per cent. Defying record-low British interest rates of 0.5 per cent, banking giant Santander put up mortgage rates for some customers with other banks likely to follow suit. And despite Chancellor George Osborne blocking a fuel duty rise, petrol prices are up sharply in recent weeks and poor weather and increased transport costs also mean supermarkets will probably be increasing the prices of some essentials above rates of inflation. 'With approximately 25 million households in the UK, this would be the equivalent to about £50 less in real income per household in 2012 and £200 less next year,' Morgan Stanley economist Jonathan Ashworth said. Britain faces a 'winter of misery' because of the cost of heating and lighting a home and the Government is being urged to intervene and block more huge price rises by energy firms, which experts believe are coming. Trouble: British families face a 'winter of misery' as many companies look likely to raise the cost of gas and electricity again . SSE's nine per cent increase means its eight million gas and electricity customers will pay on average £8.53 a month more from October – taking the average annual bill to £1,274. Northern Ireland is the only part of Britain where prices are still regulated according to the wholesale costs of gas, electricity and coal. This autumn prices for some there are likely to drop by 14 per cent, according to Power NI, and hold steady next year too. Last week it was also revealed that Britain is now the tenth most expensive place in the world to fill up your car.

A man who spent more than two decades behind bars was freed on Friday after DNA evidence cleared him in the rape of a 14-year-old Fort Worth girl. David Lee Wiggins was convicted and sentenced to life in prison in 1989, although neither of the two fingerprints found at the scene matched his. The girl, whose face was covered during most of the attack, picked Wiggins out of a photo lineup and then a live lineup, saying he looked familiar. Freed: David Lee Wiggins, center, is released on bond on Friday after convicted and sentenced to life in prison in 1989 for a crime he has long said he did not commit . Results: Innocence Project attorney Nina Morrison smiles beside David Lee Wiggins after the nonprofits' efforts for a DNA test revealed no connection to him and the crime scene . But DNA testing earlier this month excluded Wiggins as the person who committed the crime. Tarrant County prosecutors said DNA evidence demonstrated his innocence. 'I really believed him,' said Nina Wagnor who worked as a legal assistant fighting for him until 2007 told the Star Telegram. In a step beyond her call of duty, after meeting him during a visit to the Tarrant County Jail in 1989 to see her son, she married Wiggins for 17 years to better access all his information during his legal battle. 'Since I wasn't married to him, I couldn't find out a whole lot,' Wagnor said. 'He asked me if I would marry him and I said, “I will.”’ In December that year, with Wiggins wearing leg shackles before a Justice of the Peace, the couple said 'I do.' 'I never had no doubt. I thought how could anybody see all this stuff and not know that he's innocent, that he didn't do this. How could anyone not know?' she told the paper. Marriage: After meeting Wiggins, left, in the Tarrant County Jail in 1989, legal assistant Nina Wagnor married the inmate to access all his information in a wedding, pictured, that bound his ankles in shackles . Celebrating: With his sister Candy Berg at his side David Lee Wiggins, 48, shakes a well wisher's hand as he is released on bond . Concluding a 24-year-long sentence this week, State District Judge Louis Sturns in Fort Worth freed Wiggins on a personal bond after approving a motion to overturn his conviction. - David Lee Wiggons . Before the crime is officially cleared from his record, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals must accept the judge's recommendation or the governor must grant a pardon. Either step is considered a formality after the judge's ruling. 'I hold no bitterness,' Wiggins said in court after the judge's ruling. 'I'm thankful to Jesus Christ. He said he could move mountains, and surely this was a mountain. ... And to the victim: I'm not mad at you. I don't hold you responsible.' The packed courtroom erupted into applause following his statement and people rose to their feet. Wiggins later hugged his relatives and some other men who have been freed from prison after DNA evidence exonerated them in recent years. About a dozen of them attended the court hearing to support Wiggins. Emotional release: Wiggins, seen hugging his sister, was convicted and sentenced to life in prison in 1989 and spent more then two decades behind bars . 'We draw strength from each other,' said Charles Chatman, who was freed in 2008 after serving nearly 27 years for a rape he did not commit. 'We're the only people who know what we are going through.' Wiggins, who wore a blue shirt and tan pants, said his immediate plans included eating a hamburger and spending time with his sister who is a former police officer. She herself has said she never lost faith in her brother who learned he had been adopted into their family when he was just a teenager. 'He has had problems in the past but that isn't the kind of thing he would have done,' Candy Berg told the Telegram. 'He's amazingly honest about what he has done, even when I was a cop. He would have told me about it. We're a pretty close family,' she said. 'He was a little criminal, don't get me wrong,' Wagnor told the paper, adding that she only divorced him in 2007 to collect social security benefits from her late ex-husband when she fell into bad health. Handling: Wrongfully picked out of a lineup by the then 14-year-old rape victim, Wiggins said on Friday that he holds no hard feelings toward the girl . Plans: He announced his next plans to eat a burger at one of his favourite restaurants and spend time with his sister, pictured beside him, who says she never lost faith in him . 'But he never did nothing like that. It was penny ante stuff,' she said. Being in the wrong place at the wrong time, Wagnor said Wiggins was placed in a lineup of potential suspects for the rape because of his past convictions for burglary and his similar age, race and description provided by the victim. Wiggins said he agreed to be in that police lineup in 1988 because he knew that he didn't commit the crime and thought he had nothing to worry about. Instead, it led to a 24-year nightmare. Wagnor said she helped him for years fight the charges against him but felt that 'everything we did just got shoved back at us.' She said that she remembers him writing to the nonprofit group the Innocence Project while in jail, but didn't know anything had come from it. Repayment: After his conviction is formally reversed, Wiggins will be eligible for $80,000 a year in compensation that Texas pays to wrongfully convicted ex-inmates . It was that group who made the request for the DNA tests, something Wagnor had done herself but at the time of her battle was told that the sample collected at the crime scene was too small. 'I always believed the truth would come out,' he said on Friday. He will now live with a friend he met through his church ministry, according to the Innocence Project, whose attorneys started working on his case in 2007 - the same year Wagnor said she lost touch with him. After his conviction is formally reversed, Wiggins will be eligible for $80,000 a year in compensation that Texas pays to wrongfully convicted ex-inmates. Wiggins would be the second person to have a conviction overturned by DNA in Tarrant County since 2001. In neighboring Dallas County, more than 30 people have had convictions overturned since 2001. About 80 per cent of wrongful convictions in Texas are due to faulty witness identifications, said Cory Session, whose half-brother Timothy Cole was wrongfully convicted in a 1985 rape and died in prison before he was declared innocent. Session said a Texas law passed last year requires all law enforcement agencies to adopt better procedures when using eyewitness identifications.","David Lee Wiggins released on bond after serving more than two decades behind bars .

And now, Amanda Holden, who is also mother to six-year-old daughter Lexi . with husband Chris Hughes, has been voted the celebrity mother they’d most like to turn to for baby related advice. The Britain’s got Talent judge topped the poll of 400 women, winning over a third of the popular vote. Amanda dominated the votes to be crowned the mother that most women would turn to for baby advice . Holden, also famed for her roles in the TV series Cutting It and Wild at Heart, scored 36% of the vote, eleven points ahead of Holly Willoughby who came in second place. Despite leading the brood of four children, picking up the bronze medal was Victoria Beckham, who only managed to achieve 15% of the public’s vote. So great was Holden and Willoughby’s score that they left all opposition in their wake. In fact the combined scores of the mothers outside the top three does not even come close to the score achieved by Holden. Holly Willoughby came in second place with mother-of-four Victoria Beckham came in third place . Although going through a messy divorce with her husband Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, who hasn't let daughter Suri leave her side in recent months, took fourth place scoring seven per cent of the vote. Just behind her was Myleene Klass with six per cent. In joint sixth place with four per cent were Dannii Minogue and Angelina Jolie. Behind them in joint seventh place were Beyoncé and Una Healy scoring three per cent. In last place was the glamour model Katie Price who achieved only two per cent of the popular vote despite often being in the running for 'Mum of the year' awards. Myleene Klass took the fourth place spot whilst Kate Price was left in bottom place . A spokesperson for My1stYears.com, who carried out the survey, said: 'It is important to note that this poll is by no means a reflection on the celebs’ capability as mothers, it is merely a survey to see who mums would go to for advice.

'It is no real surprise that Amanda Holden topped the list as not only is she very popular at the moment, and her recent life experiences makes her very appealing to mothers. 'Likewise, Holly Willoughby comes across as very real and committed to the upbringing of her children as opposed to palming the responsibility off to a nanny.' One mum who took part in the poll commented: 'I’ve got nothing against the other women on the list, but I voted for Holly Willoughby because she is someone who doesn’t parade her children round as fashion accessories. For her, family life is separate from her celebrity.' Another participant said: 'I absolutely love Amanda Holden, you only have to listen to the support and advice she gives the contestants on Britain’s got Talent to know that she would give you excellent advice.'","Amanda Holden, Holly Willoughby and Victoria Beckham in top three .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 09:59 EST, 25 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 10:23 EST, 25 June 2012 . Diabetic Margaret Pitt, 55, suffered irreversible brain damage in November 2010 after medics at Alexandra Hospital, in Redditch, Worcestershire, failed to monitor her blood sugar levels . A diabetic mother-of-three died after doctors forgot to check her blood sugar levels - days after she went to hospital with dangerously low glucose levels. Margaret Pitt, 55, who had lived with type one diabetes for 30 years, admitted herself to hospital when she realised her blood sugar levels were too low. But after she was moved off the intensive care ward at Alexandra Hospital, Worcestershire, medics neglected to continue to monitor her blood levels - and she collapsed and suffered irreversible brain damage in November 2010. Now, a coronor has criticised medics who carried out her treatment - describing the actions of a nurse who failed to check the teaching assistant’s blood levels as 'a gross failure to provide basic medical treatment'. Margaret’s devastated widower, David, said: 'Maggie and I had been happily married for 35 years and for her life to be tragically cut short so needlessly is almost too much to bear. 'I am absolutely distraught by Margaret’s death and very angry that she was let down so badly by the nurses that she put her complete trust in. 'My wife deserved far better. She was on a ward which was supposed to have experience of caring for diabetic patients and supposedly had the expertise to treat her condition, yet it appears she was just left to deteriorate without anyone checking her blood sugar levels. 'Over the years there were a number of occasions when I had to pull Maggie out of hypoglycaemic shock. I would check the back of her neck and if she was perspiring, I would give her warm water and a glucose tablet. It’s not rocket science and so I still don’t understand how trained medical staff got it so wrong.' Margaret had lived with type one diabetes for more than 30 years, having been diagnosed when she was 20 years old, and over the years had become used to the daily routine of injections and checking her blood glucose levels. However, on 4 November 2010 Margaret began to feel unwell and she recognised the tell-tale signs that her blood glucose levels had risen to a point where she needed medical help. She was admitted to the Alexandra Hospital and after being treated in intensive care she was moved to a ward for ongoing glucose tests and treatment. In the early hours of 13 November, Margaret was found collapsed and unconscious and she was rushed back to intensive care where doctors discovered that she had suffered severe brain damage as a result of dangerously low blood glucose levels. Her family were told that the damage was irreversible and there was nothing more that could be done. She remained in intensive care until she was transferred to Primrose Hospice on 19 November where two days later, she died. Mrs Pitt admitted herself to the Alexandra Hospital, Worcestershire, when she realised her glucose levels were dangerously low . During a five-day inquest, HM Deputy Coroner for Worcestershire, Marguerite Elcock, heard how an experienced nurse failed to carry out blood tests which would have shown that Margaret’s glucose levels were not being controlled after she was admitted. Medical law expert Sara Burns, from solicitors Irwin Mitchell, representing the family, said: 'The inquest has been incredibly harrowing for Margaret’s family as they have heard that she was woefully let down by a number of clinicians on this ward. 'Repeated opportunities to intervene and stabilise Margaret were missed and guidelines for blood glucose level testing were not followed to manage her diabetes. 'NHS policies and guides are in place for a reason - to save lives, and staff across the NHS must follow these to prevent unnecessary deaths. 'We will continue to help Margaret’s family in their battle for justice and we are now considering whether, given the evidence heard during this inquest, it is appropriate for us to refer the case to the Nursing and Midwifery Council.' David added: 'I believe Margaret would still be alive today if she had received the correct treatment and, although nothing will turn back the clock for us, I hope improvements have since been made to protect any other family from suffering the heartbreak we have had to endure.' Margaret’s daughter, Samantha, added: 'Margaret or ‘Maggie’ as she was affectionately known, was a loving mother, grandmother, sister and daughter. Her unexpected death has left a very large void in all our lives. 'Due to a series of failures she is now unable to watch her children and grandchildren grow up and have been stripped of the chance to happily live out her retirement in her beloved chosen location of Somerset for which she had so many plans. 'We are grateful that the inquest has provided us with some important answers regarding the circumstances of my Mum’s death, so that we as a family can have some closure after 19 long and very hard months.' A spokesperson for Worcestershire NHS Trust said: 'Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust would like to offer sincere condolences to Mrs Pitt's family following the death of Mrs Pitt in 2010 and a difficult week exploring those events in court. 'The appropriate internal investigations and action have been taken according to Trust policy.  The Trust has taken prompt action in relation to this event and continues to invest heavily in diabetes services both within the Trust hospitals and across county-wide community services, including leading the Think Glucose initiative regionally. 'We accept the Deputy Coroner's conclusions and hope that the Family of Mrs Pitt has found the detailed inquiry helpful.'","Mrs Pitt admitted herself to hospital when she realised her glucose levels were very low .

"By . Jenny Hope . PUBLISHED: . 18:01 EST, 25 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 03:19 EST, 27 July 2012 . New gold standard: Professor Bryan Williams said the new chart could potentially transform patient safety in UK hospitals . The lives of at least 6,000 hospital . patients could be saved each year by using a standard scoring system . that alerts doctors and nurses to their deteriorating condition. A score of seven or more out of ten on a patient’s chart would result in their immediate transfer to specialist care. At present one in 20 deaths in . hospital is rated as preventable, caused by factors such as poor . monitoring and dehydration, where staff failed to act soon enough. The Royal College of Physicians says . half of these deaths could be avoided if all hospital staff used the . same national early warning score to trigger immediate action. There are more than 100 different types of chart where patients’ vital signs are recorded, sometimes several times a day. But there should be only one system . used by all staff who check on patients’ conditions – whether they are . in hospitals, care homes or in ambulances, says the RCP. The system would mean doctors and nurses could move between hospitals without having to learn how to read a new chart. The chart records vital signs such as pulse, temperature and blood pressure, giving each a score. The doctor or nurse adds up the score . every time the vital signs are recorded, meaning they can recognise . immediately the severity of illness and whether the patient needs closer . monitoring, or transfer to critical care units. The score depends on . how much variation there is in a patient’s condition. A medium score of five or six would alert a doctor or nurse to the need for an urgent assessment of the patient. A high score of seven or more would . usually result in urgent transfer to more specialist facilities. Because . the doctor is alerted instantly to the score when they check a . patient’s vital signs, action is less likely to be delayed when a . patient starts to deteriorate. Having the same new chart (pictured) would mean nurses and doctors could move between hospitals without having to learn a new system . Bryan Williams, chairman of the working party that developed the chart, said a study of 1,000 adults dying in acute hospitals in England and Wales estimated 5 per cent of the deaths were preventable – 12,000 a year. He predicted around half the deaths could have been avoided using the standardised score for recognising very sick patients whose condition is worsening. ‘Many changes in healthcare are incremental but this new national early warning score has the potential to transform patient safety in our hospitals and improve patient outcomes, it is hugely important,’ said professor Williams. Doctors and nurses could be easily trained on the scoring system, which should become part of undergraduate medical education, he said. Janet Davies of the Royal College of Nursing said: ‘There is nothing nurses and doctors should prioritise more than patient safety, and this system, if implemented across the board, will be a great leap forward for patient care. ‘Excellent systems for recognising patient deterioration do exist in many care settings, and have undoubtedly saved many lives. However, this is the first time clinical expertise and experience have come together to standardise the best of that practice. ‘I hope that every trust will adopt this system as soon as possible, as countless lives could be saved in the future by adopting this simple process.’ Several trusts have already approached the RCP because they want to use the system. Katherine Murphy, chief executive of The Patients Association, said the new system should be introduced urgently. She said the public would be shocked to learn that the NHS had ‘been operating such an ad hoc system’.","Currently more than 100 different types of charts to monitor patients in the UK .

"By . Graham Smith . PUBLISHED: . 05:41 EST, 29 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 13:20 EST, 29 May 2012 . A mother who was given 18 months to live after doctors failed to diagnose her cancer more than a dozen times has made a miracle recovery after the first operation of its kind in the UK. Ruth McDonagh, 47, was repeatedly turned away by medics over the course of two years despite suffering from the classic symptoms of bowel cancer. By the time the disease was diagnosed, she was told she had just 18 months left to live as a tumour in her bowel had grown so large it was almost inoperable. On the mend: But Ruth McDonagh was repeatedly turned away by doctors over the course of two years despite suffering from the classic symptoms of bowel cancer . Ms McDonagh's only option was a £100,000 operation only available in the U.S. and which was certain to leave her paralysed from the waist down. But at the eleventh hour a team of British doctors trained in the American technique agreed to carry out her surgery in a 13-hour operation never before carried out in the UK. And to her elation, when Ms McDonagh came round from the surgery she was able to wiggle her toes - meaning doctors had, against the odds, managed to save the feeling in her legs. Ms McDonagh, who lives in Enfield, North London, with her son Brandon, 11, said: 'I feel like I have been given a second chance at life. 'When you’re told you have cancer the first thing you think is that you are going to die. Leaving Brandon behind was all that I could think about. Who would look after him? What would happen to him? 'Now he tells everyone he meets that Mummy hasn’t got cancer any more, whether he knows them or not - it’s wonderful.' Early bowel cancer may have no symptoms. Initial symptoms can also occur in people with less serious problems such as haemorrhoids. However, the NHS recommends seeing your doctor if you notice the following: . As the disease progresses it can also cause anaemia leading to fatigue and breathlessness. If you are worried about any symptoms you can also call the Bowel Cancer UK Support line on 0800 8403540 . Ms McDonagh’s health problems began in 2008 when she noticed blood in her stools and had difficulty going to the toilet. She went to her GP but, as her symptoms worsened, she was given varying diagnoses from doctors who claimed she had everything from IBS to pelvic inflammatory disease. At one point, Ms McDonagh was suffering from such severe abdominal pain that she could barely walk. But she was still told go home, have hot baths and eat different foods. When she became so ill she could no longer eat, one doctor prescribed Ms McDonagh a herbal remedy and wrote that she was 'neurotic' in her notes. Even when she told medics she thought she had bowel cancer her fears were laughed off and she was told she was far too young. By the time she was eventually diagnosed, Ms McDonagh’s cancer had been missed on 13 separate occasions and two years had passed, allowing the tumour that was growing from her bowel to progress. Following chemotherapy and radiotherapy, it was discovered the 8cm-long growth was wrapped around her tailbone - or sacrum - and the surgery to remove it was far too complicated to be performed by UK surgeons, or so she was told. Even if Ms McDonagh were to undergo the £100,000 sacrectomy operation, which was available privately in the U.S., she would almost certainly be left paralysed. Without the operation, she was told she had a maximum of 18 months left to live. Ms McDonagh after the 13-hour operation at Leeds General Hospital which was carried out by a team of British doctors trained in an American technique never before carried out in the UK . 'Second chance at life': Ms McDonagh lives in Enfield, North London, with her son Brandon, 11 . Ms McDonagh said: 'I didn’t care what happened to me, I just wanted to still be around for my son. I wasn’t even angry because I was more worried about Brandon to feel anything else. 'But they couldn’t find anyone in this country who was qualified to do the sacrectomy. Only about 50 operations are performed anywhere in the world each year. 'The tumour had spread so far up my tailbone that no one was prepared to do it as they had never performed one like it before. It was a very complex operation and had a lot of risks. Essentially they would be cutting away at the root of my spine. Before the operation, well-wishers at Chase Farm Hospital in Enfield paid for Ms McDonagh to take Brandon to Euro Disney, where he met singer Peter Andre . Relief: Ms McDonagh recovering after the operation that she thought would leave her paralysed . 'But even though I was told it would most likely leave me paralysed, I was desperate to find someone to do it. I started trying to raise the £100,000 to go to America myself and contacted everyone I knew.' After months of frantic fundraising, Ms McDonagh finally received the call she had been waiting for - orthopaedic surgeon Professor Peter Giannoudis and consultant neurosurgeon Dr Jake Timothy had agreed to take on her case with another surgeon at Leeds General Infirmary. Earlier this month it emerged that a critically-acclaimed British composer has been left wheelchair bound after a hospital misdiagnosed his fractured spine. Medical staff at the Russells Hall Hospital in Dudley failed to diagnose Andrew Downes' fractured back after the 61-year-old suffered a fall at home in October 2009. His case is one of several high-profile blunders where medics misdiagnosed patients' conditions. In January this year a mother sued the obstetrician who she claims misdiagnosed her pregnancy as ectopic and injected her foetus with an abortant, resulting in birth defects. Thirty-five-year-old Rachel Schoger of Caldwell, Idaho, says she was four weeks five days pregnant with her daughter, Seraphine, when her doctor injected her foetus with chemotherapy drug methotrexate in 2006. Two weeks later, the baby was found inside the uterus. And against all odds, Seraphine made it through term. A survey last month revealed that two thirds of young people with cancer will visit their GP with at least one of the most common cancer symptoms - yet a third of these cases are missed by doctors, according to research. One in four had to visit their doctor at least four times before they were taken seriously and referred to a specialist. Lucy Parker, 17, from the Isle Of Man, was only diagnosed with a muscle tumour when her mother took her to hospital after she was turned away by her GP three times. Of those who were at first misdiagnosed, 12 per cent were told they were attention seeking while 15 per cent were told they just had a virus. Other misdiagnoses included telling patients they were suffering indigestion, vertigo or swine flu. Together the three surgeons worked for 13 . hours to remove Ms McDonagh’s sacrum, her bowel, her womb and to repair damage to her kidneys. The surgery was described as being akin to a car crash in physical terms. Ms McDonagh was also warned once more that the surgery would probably leave her without the use of the lower half of her body, but she was determined to go ahead. She said: 'As far as I was concerned, there was no choice to make. The surgery was my only chance of survival and I had to fight for my survival.' Before the op, kind well-wishers at Chase Farm Hospital in Enfield paid for Ruth to take her son to Euro Disney for what she feared might be the last quality time she would ever spend with him. Then, on March 12 this year, Ms McDonagh awoke from the operation. She said: 'When I woke up from the . surgery I was completely elated. I could wiggle my toes and I could feel . my legs so I knew that meant they’d been able to save one of my nerves. 'I . felt terrible, but I’d never been happier. The doctors explained to me . that the surgery had gone better than they had expected, that they’d . removed all the tumour and been able to spare the feeling in my legs. I . couldn’t thank them enough.' Ms McDonagh spent the next two weeks in hospital and then returned home to Enfield where she is learning to walk again on crutches. Doctors cannot say if the cancer will ever return but as far as she is concerned, her recovery is miraculous. Ms McDonagh . said: 'I was terminal. I was written off as dead. I can’t believe I’ve . been given another chance to go on living and being a mother to my son. 'I . am angry at the fact it took so long to diagnose me. I think the sad . fact is that the NHS is under too much strain financially and the . doctors were reluctant to take me seriously because of my age. 'But if they had given me a blood test or a colonoscopy four years ago I would have saved them thousands. 'What . I would say to anyone is that they need to be aware of their own bodies . and if you know something isn’t right - even if a doctor is telling you . that you are fine - get a second opinion and be persistent. 'Having said that, the surgeons that worked on me were incredible and the care I received from them was amazing. 'They have saved my life and my mobility. I can get from A to B and I still have my independence so I don’t mind if I wobble a little, I get there in the end. 'I have to take everything one day at a time and no one can tell me what the future holds but I’m so grateful that I’m still here. 'Most importantly, I’m still here for Brandon and that’s what matters.' Ms McDonagh is raising funds and awareness for bowel cancer.

This is the moment a daredevil photographer stared down death through his lens - as two Argentine fighter jets swooped on the ship he was standing on. The snapper, who has never been named, somehow survived the Falklands War attack by two A4 Skyhawks on May 25, 1982. The Argentine Air Force had tasked its pair of prized pilots to take out HMS Coventry and HMS Broadsword - the two British ships on duty to the northwest of the disputed archipelago. Bravery: The snapper, who has never been named, somehow survived the Falklands War attack by two A4 Skyhawks on May 25, 1982 . Captain Pablo Carballo, in the left plane, and Lieutenant Carlos Rinke, right, skimmed just a few feet above the water to avoid radar detection. Both pilots survived because the Sea Wolf missile system on HMS Broadsword was unable to choose between their A-4s when they became visible on the radar. The aircrafts released one bomb each. One missed the target, while the other one hit the Broadsword, in spite of the intense anti-aircraft fire. Zeus flight, two A-4s piloted by Lt. Mariano A. Velasco and Alfrez Leonardo Barrionuevo, armed with three lighter bombs, soon followed on. Lt. Velasco fired his cannons and then released his three bombs that hit and heavily damaged HMS Coventry, which sank within 20 minutes. Nineteen lives were lost on board HMS Coventry when two of the three bombs exploded, but the other 280 crew members were saved. The air raid came during what was known to be a highly risky operation, with the two ships deployed to draw Argentine bombers away from where British troops were landing at San Carlos Bay. Sinking: HMS Coventry went down shortly after the first picture was taken . Among the survivors was the ship's captain, David Hart Dyke - father of the TV comedienne Miranda Hart - who managed to swim to a life raft. Now 72, he once described in the Daily Mail the dread he felt when four Argentine planes showed up on the radar - and the chaos that ensued after the 1,000lb bombs went off. He wrote: 'My world exploded. I was aware of a flash, of heat and the crackling of the radar set as it literally disintegrated in front of my face. When I came to my senses, I could see nothing through the dense black smoke, only people on fire, but I could sense that the compartment had been totally devastated.' Mr Hart Dyke, who sustained facial injuries as flames ripped through the ship, has since released his account in a book entitled Four Weeks In May. Last week he attended a memorial dinner to mark 30 years since the attack.

A schoolboy who stunned his family with his bravery after he was diagnosed with a terminal brain tumour, has died this morning. David Langton-Gilks, 16, who battled the disease for five years, had thought he had beaten the tumour in May this year. When he was told he had relapsed and would die in a matter of weeks, he stunned his relations by saying: 'You can’t win them all.' David slipped into a coma last Saturday and died at 6.10am today - six weeks after . doctors expected him to pass away. 'He died surrounded by love at home,' his mother Sacha, who is a singing teacher, said. Special evening: David was thrilled with the black limousine that arrived to take him to his school prom . David Langton-Gilks, earlier this year with the family dog Honey . She also revealed on . Twitter she found her son's will a few days before he died. He wanted . his things to be shared between his siblings, Rufus and Holly, with his . collection of jellybeans to go to his younger sister. His ukulele was to . go to a family friend. David was told at the beginning of June his condition was terminal and decided that he didn't want further chemotherapy. However, he was desperate to make his . school prom on June 28. His mother Sacha, 44, was able to tell friends . and supporters on Twitter that he fulfilled his ambition. 'DD's DONE it! Grinning in black tie by pristine black limo on our dirty, bumpy farm track,' she posted that evening. The limo was provided by the charity . Rays of Sunshine and marked the start of a very special night, during . which David won the award for 'Most Optimistic Person.' Mrs Langton-Gilk's Twitter updates also revealed David's wish to be cremated and have his ashes scattered at a local watering hole. She also paid tribute to his extraordinary philosophical attitude to life. The day after his prom he told her: 'It's funny how u (sic) realise the significance of your life just when you're about to lose it.' Later that day he said to his parents, Sacha, 44 and Toby, 46: 'I just want to say that I have very much enjoyed myself here; thank you very much.' David, pictured surfing in Cornwall. The trip was paid for by the charity Round Table Children's Wish Limited . The teenager, from Fontmell Magna, in . Dorset, had stopped going to school in May due to concentration problems . caused by the tumour and said his only regret was not being able to do . his Biology A level. His memory worsened as time went on which meant he had to replace reading and playing the guitar with simpler tasks such as cooking. But he still shared precious . exchanges with his family. His mother said his little sister would insist David play . with her saying: 'You can rest when you're dead.' David's mother, Sacha Langton-Gilks. She said David had shown her how to cope by being so strong . Then on 6 August, she recounted . another bittersweet conversation: 'DD 2 me: ""Do I know u?"" Me: ""Yes, very well."" DD: . ""You look very like my mother."" Me: ""Yes I certainly do. She's . marvellous!""' The family were helped by Marie Curie nurses who provided much-needed nighttime relief and other support. They were also boosted by how well Team GB did at the Olympics, providing a much-needed distraction. Mrs Langton-Gilks and her family are backing the Headsmart awareness campaign run by The Brain Tumour Charity, to highlight the importance . of detecting brain tumours in children at an early stage. Although David displayed the symptoms . of the disease when he was 11, they were not simultaneous and it took . five-and-a-half weeks to get a diagnosis. Had . it been detected sooner, the tumour would have been around half the . size it was and David would have stood a much better chance of survival. The symptoms of the Medulloblastoma brain tumour include vomiting, headaches, and unusual eye movements. Children have the same risk of developing a brain tumour as meningitis. David's parents released a statement today that said: 'The Langton-Gilks family are determined that everyone knows how to spot the signs of a brain tumour in a child/young person. 'Supporting the HeadSmart Campaign is the fastest way to achieve this. This will save the lives of some of the two coachloads of children who die horribly every year from a brain tumour and massively improve the quality of life for those children, like David, who have to endure years of complex treatment.' They added: 'The family will never be able to express fully their gratitude & admiration to all of the doctors, nurses & support staff at Southampton General Hospital, Salisbury District Hospital & Shaftesbury Abbeyview Medical Centre as well as the following charities: CLICSargent, Marie Curie, the Teenage Cancer Trust and The Brain Tumour Charity who started HeadSmart.'

Every child's first birthday is a milestone occasion, and one that is celebrated by delighted parents. But for premature baby Shayne Welsh, his first birthday is not only a milestone, but a miracle. Shayne was declared dead by doctors for 25 minutes after he stopped breathing - but miraculously came back to life. He stopped breathing in an incubator a day into his life, after being born at just 26 weeks, when he failed to breathe without the help of a ventilator. Survivor: Kerry holds Shayne when he is just a month old at New Cross Hospital, Wolverhampton . Doctors and nurses battled to stabilise Shayne as he fought for life struggling to breath with his barely formed lungs . Miracle boy: Shayne looks on at his first birthday cake - which no one expected after his heart stopped for 25 minutes . Tiny Shayne Welsh was born weighing just 1lb 14oz but has since gone from strength to strength . Nurses at New Cross Hospital, Wolverhampton, could not revive him and informed parents Kerry, 39, and Simon Welsh, 44, the toddler had passed away. But as they prepared for a chaplain to christen the baby they noticed he still had a faint heartbeat and rushed him back into intensive care. Now he has celebrated his first birthday surrounded by family and friends, overjoyed he has developed so fast he is the same as any other one-year-old boy. Kerry and Simon from Walsall, West . Midlands, who had been trying for a baby for 18 years and had six . miscarriages said his life was meant to be. Kerry . said: 'The nurses told us he had gone and that there was no vital signs . of life. I asked them to keep trying but they said it was no use. Tiny: His parents were devastated to learn their little boy had died - but his heart started beating again and the little boy, seen here aged one month, grew stronger and stronger . What a trooper! Shayne plays happily just before his first birthday last week, a year after he was given up for dead . Boy wonder! Shayne has celebrated his first birthday surrounded by family, who are overjoyed he has developed so fast he is the same as any other one-year-old . 'We held him for 20 minutes taking it in turns and saying our goodbyes thinking we’d lost Shayne forever. 'They said there might still be movement in him from the gasses in his body but he was there and just still. We had no idea he would start breathing again. 'We wanted him christened and as they took him away the nurses rushed back a few minutes later and said he was breathing again. 'We watched them rig him back up to the ventilator and oxygen. 'I just turned around stunned and I literally slid down the wall in shock. 'Simon and I couldn’t believe it. We think it was maybe moving him so much in preparation for the christening that re-started his heart. After 18 years of trying for a baby, Simon and Kerry were thrilled when Shayne - seen here in a high dependency care - pulled through . Milestone: Simon, Kerry and Shayne at his christening, months after nurses told them that their little boy died . 'Being that small how could he survive? At that age you haven’t developed proper lungs. It’s amazing he came back. 'The nurses said he’s fighting back but we just don’t know how long for. 'It was still 50/50 for weeks he would make it through but he did.' He has has been labelled ‘the event’ by staff at the hospital after the amazing back from the dead incident that doctors say they have never witnessed. Medics can still not understand how Shayne, who weighed just 1lb 14oz at birth, had the lung capacity to breathe again after his heart stopped. But after reviving him and keeping him on a ventilator and oxygen for the eight weeks after the incident, he pulled through to now live a healthy first year. Nothing gets in his way: Tiny Shayne died in an incubator a day into his life at just 26 weeks old and nurses could not revive him - but now he is fighting fit after his miraculous recovery . Growing up fast! Shayne, seen at nine months old at his playgroup, 'fought all the way and he¿s here now a beautiful baby' He also survived four blood transfusions, bleeds on the brain and a hole in the heart which is common to premature children. Kerry and Simon first lost a child in 1996 but did not discover until 2001 that Kerry had polycystic ovaries that meant it was unlikely she could be pregnant with a child for longer than 37 weeks. Despite the concerns, she endured a normal pregnancy with Shayne for six months until September 12 last year when he arrived with no warning. Kerry said: 'I had back ache and doctors said they suspected it was an infection and to put my feet up and get some rest. Shayne will have tests for the next four years on his eyes and ears to ensure his early arrival in life does not hinder his development . Kerry said: 'After 18 years of heartache and even the second day of his life and what we went through, I wouldn¿t change it for the world' 'Within hours though I was fully dilated and they said the baby’s head is ready to arrive. It was a bolt from the blue. 'They said he had a 60 to 70 per cent chance of survival but it all depended on him breathing on his own. 'I never bought anything baby wise in the lead up to his birth, I didn’t want to tempt fate and we chose not to know if it was going to be a boy or a girl. 'Before we conceived they told me the more weight I lost the better the chance I would have of mothering a child so I set about losing as much as possible. 'We lost twins in 2002 and then had four other miscarriages. 'But after 18 years of heartache and even the second day of his life and what we went through, I wouldn’t change it for the world.' Shayne was allowed home first time on November 30 last year, 11 weeks after his remarkable recovery. He has only had to return once since for a bout of tonsillitis. He will have tests for the next four years on his eyes and ears to ensure his early arrival in life does not hinder his development. Otherwise, he now happily plays at his local nursery with children his own age. Kerry said: 'If you don’t tell people, they’d never know just how premature he was. He was crawling and sitting up before many children his age do and he’s all set to start walking in the next few weeks. 'The hospital was fantastic. We cannot praise the staff there enough for they did for us and Shayne. 'He fought all the way and he’s here now a beautiful baby.

But for one mother who exists solely on tea and biscuits, due to a rare condition which paralyses her stomach, it is a reality. Suzanne Kettle, 28, can only drink three cups of tea and eat a handful of biscuits a day after developing gastroparesis. The condition prevents her stomach from contracting to digest food, meaning it takes her eight hours to process a meal - six times longer than a normal person. Losing weight: Suzanne Kettle, 28, can only drink three cups of tea and eat a handful of biscuits a day after developing gastroparesis . The mother-of-one has dropped three stone in weight and has had to give up her shop selling baby clothes because of her condition. She has been forced to live on a tea and biscuit diet as she immediately begins to feel unwell if she eats or drinks anything else. Mrs Kettle, from Cumbernauld, North Lanarkshire, Scotland, said her condition means she is left exhausted by walking her son Matthew, four, just half a mile to school. She said: 'Most days, I can only manage a tea and biscuit without feeling ill. I have lost so much weight. 'On a good day, I can only manage a cup of tea and a biscuit for breakfast, the same again for lunch and maybe two tablespoons of mashed potato for dinner. 'It’s difficult. I had to give up my business, I have no energy and I’m constantly in hospital. 'I can’t keep anything down and food is always getting stuck in my oesophagus and I have to make myself ill to get it back up again. 'I have gone from a size 14 to a size 10 in the last year because of the lack of food. 'It’s a good job I wasn’t a skinny girl to begin with, otherwise there would be nothing of me left now. I can’t go on like this, I need a pacemaker.' Mrs Kettle with her husband Gary in 2009, before she contracted the disease. The mother-of-one has since dropped three stone in weight . Mrs Kettle was forced to give up her shop selling baby clothes because of her condition and is desperate to have a special stomach pacemaker fitted. But she must go through a rigorous testing process to find out whether she is eligible for the £25,000 surgery on the NHS. She first began to suffer nausea and pains in her stomach three years ago and went to A&E at Glasgow Royal Infirmary when the symptoms worsened. She was then hospitalised dozens of times and was misdiagnosed with gallstones, liver problems and even a psychiatric illness. In January last year, frustrated Mrs Kettle was given 20 injections directly into her stomach to relieve the pain but the effects were only temporary. She was left to suffer for another 18 months, not knowing what was causing her illness. Mrs Kettle, who lives with husband Gary, 29, said: 'I started getting bad stomach pains and feeling tired all the time. I kept ending up in hospital which was hard for my son because he always worried I would never come out again. 'Eventually the specialist at the Royal said he didn’t know. Basically a person’s stomach normally contracts to digest food but my just doesn’t. The food sits there like a lead weight. 'If I have eaten even a tiny amount of rice the night before I still feel full the next day.' Another cuppa: Mrs Kettle is desperate to have a special stomach pacemaker fitted, which will use an electric charge to stimulate the stomach muscles . Mr and Mrs Kettle with her son Mathew in 2009. She must go through a rigorous testing process to find out whether she is eligible for the £25,000 surgery on the NHS . In May this year, Mrs Kettle’s confusion came to an end when she sought a second opinion from doctors at Glasgow’s Stobhill Hospital and was finally diagnosed with gastroparesis. She said the origins of the condition remain a mystery in her case, with it normally affecting diabetes sufferers. But despite her illness, Mrs Kettle is determined to beat the condition and in two weeks’ time will have a temporary pacemaker fitted through her nasal passages. The pacemaker will use an electric charge to stimulate the stomach muscles. The machine will be used for a week to monitor how it affects her diet and then consultations will begin for a permanent pacemaker to be placed in her stomach. Mrs Kettle said: 'The pacemaker stimulates the muscles to contract, which I need because it can take me 500 minutes to digest a small amount of plain rise or potato. 'The operation is not covered on the NHS and I don’t have £25,000 lying around so I don’t know what I am going to do. 'We’ll see what the effects of the temporary effects are and we’ll go from there. 'I just want my quality of life back and a permanent pacemaker can give me that.' A spokeswoman for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said: 'Before we carry out a permanent gastric pacemaker operation, patients undergo an extensive assessment including being fitted for a temporary pacemaker to help to evaluate the potential benefits of the device. 'The reason for this extensive assessment is the highly specialist nature of the procedure and the need for the input of a very full multi-disciplinary team both prior to the procedure and during the operation itself.'* Mrs Kettle is holding a charity fashion show at Centre Cafe in Cumbernauld on Sunday to raise money for charity Gastroparesis UK, which provides support and advice for sufferers and their families.","Suzanne Kettle, 28, suffers from gastroparesis, a rare condition that prevents her stomach from contracting to digest food ."

A newly-crowned carnival princess has been stripped of her title after organisers spotted an 'inappropriate' piercing on her neck. Sharlie Lightfoot, 15, of Faversham, Kent, was chosen to represent Teynham earlier this month and was due to make her first public appearance at Sittingbourne Carnival next month. But this week the teenager was sacked from the job for the piercing at the back of her neck, which organisers saw on her Facebook page. Axed: Sharlie Lightfoot, 15, of Faversham, Kent, who was stripped of her carnival princess title for her metal bar neck piercing . Fuming, Miss Lightfoot said there had been 'no mention' of piercings when she was awarded the role, something the organisers admit. The teen said she would not have had the piercing if she had known it would cost her the title, but did admit to having a tattoo, despite being underage. Miss Lightfoot said: 'I signed a contract and it didn't say anything about piercings so I never imagined I'd get sacked for it. 'I had a tattoo clearly on show when I was selected and no one seemed to mind that, so I didn't think twice about the piercing. 'Being in a carnival means everything to me. I have always wanted to do it.' Honour: Miss Lightfoot's mother Jodie said it had been her daughter's dream to represent the town of Teynham in the carnival line-up . Miss Lightfoot has offered to replace the metal bar with a transparent one or to take it out completely but she was told by organisers that it was too late. Miss Lightfood's mother, Jodie, 33, said: 'It was her dream. It is so unfair they have taken it away from her.' Teynham carnival chairman, Terry West, said: 'I saw the picture and decided it wasn't satisfactory for a girl representing Teynham, so the only thing I could do was to take away her sash. 'You hope the girls will set an example as they are meeting mayors, MPs and councillors. I don't think a neck piercing is appropriate. 'Unfortunately she has ruined it for herself. But she is welcome to try again next year - without the piercing.' Mr West admitted he had never specified a policy on body piercings but would formulate new rules for next year's court.","Sharlie Lightfoot said there had been 'no mention' of piercings when she was awarded role .

The husband of the 36-year-old Brooklyn teacher charged with having repeated statutory trysts with one of her high school students has said their marriage is as strong as ever. Jimmy Lathrop, 39, said his relationship with his wife Erin Saya, who is accused of statutory rape, has not suffered following the shocking allegations and denied divorce rumours. 'We’re doing fine. We’re doing awesome,' Mr Lathrop told the New York Post yesterday. 'No, there’s nothing true about that, at all. We’re not getting a divorce.' Hard times? Pictured leaving Brooklyn Criminal Court yesterday, Erin Sayar, left, and husband Jimmy Lathrop, right, did not walk side by side; a source tells the Post he's looking for a divorce lawyer . Married mother: Erin Sayar, 36, turned herself in last week and was charged with rape, criminal sex act, sexual misconduct, and sexual abuse . Sayar also denied marital problems and . declared her love for her husband. 'My husband is a great man, and I . love him very much,' she said. 'There is no divorce in our future.' Sayar revealed that she might be . returning to James Madison High School in Brooklyn where the alleged illicit . encounters occurred, adding that her colleagues were supporting her. 'I’ve spent my entire teaching career there, since 2000, and some of my . best friends are there,' she said. 'I’ve heard from them, and they’re . rooting for me. I have no plan on moving. It’s a great school. It’s a . beautiful school with highly intelligent teachers and mostly wonderful . students. 'I have a beautiful family and . beautiful friends and a gorgeous daughter. I’m generally a positive and . happy person, so I’m just really hoping for the best for everyone . involved in this, actually.' But friends and family of the couple have painted a different picture. A . source had told the New York Post that Lathrop is looking for a lawyer to help him divorce his wife. He was seen this week at Brooklyn . Criminal Court, wearing a fedora and glasses, and walking several steps . ahead of his wife, who looked disheveled in a bright pink track suit. Silent: Sayar was released from jail for now but she faces four years behind bars for alleged sexual encounters with the high school football player; she's pictured returning to her Brooklyn home . The source told the Post: ‘He’s very angry, he’s very embarrassed,’ adding that Mr Lathrop is out looking for a divorce attorney. ‘I don’ think this marriage will last,’ the source told the newspaper. Mother-of-one Sayar, who is accused of seducing football player Kevin Eng, 16, while she was a teacher at the Brooklyn school, appeared in court this week for arraignment. Sayar was released on $10,000 bond after turned herself into the NYPD Special Victims Squad and was charged with eight counts of third-degree rape and criminal sexual conduct. Kevin is still a student at the high school. As Judge Kevin McGrath set bail, he also issued an order of protection for the student. Sayar - who is facing more than four . years in jail - was supposed to be tutoring the footballer in her office . while his teammates were using the weight room next door. A chaotic scene unfolded outside the courthouse as reporters and camera crew surrounded Sayar and her husband as they left after the woman was released from jail. Chaos: Numerous news crews surrounded Sayer (centre) as she leaves court with husband Jimmy Lathrop (second from front) walking in front of her . Bond: Erin Sayar, a Brooklyn teacher who is charged with rape in a case in which authorities say the woman had sex with her student, 17, is released on bail . The pair refused to speak with reporters. Sayar remained silent and smirked . slightly at times as she walked dressed in a pink-hooded sweatshirt, . black pants and white sneakers with pink shoelaces. Instead, Sayar got into a sedan and returned to her home. Mr Lathrop also dismissed news crews wearing a top hat and his wedding ring. The parents of the 16-year-old also filed a $10million lawsuit against the married English teacher. According to the Post, Kevin was boasting about the sexual trysts on Facebook and to other students in detention. Football teammate Eddie Reid, 16, said they quickly grew suspicious, telling the Post: 'We had weight training every day in . sixth period, but instead of going to the weight room, Kevin was going . to her office — and the door was locked. 'People would go to the door and try and open it. She’d just yell ""Go to class!"" and ""Get out of the hallway!"",' Reid said. The lawyer representing Eng is . claiming his client was traumatized by what happened and that it left him . the 'subject of scorn and ridicule'. Illicit: Married teacher Erin Sayar, 36, allegedly had sex with student Kevin Eng when she was meant to be tutoring him . But other students said he was proud of the affair. The school found out about the alleged sexual relationship when Kevin's girlfriend became suspicious last November. After hacking Eng's Facebook account, . the girl found messages he had sent to Sayar which read, 'I love you so . much' and 'I always loved you, since last year'. Sayar replied: 'Oh no — I’m not putting myself out there again. I made that mistake last night and you couldn’t handle it.' Despite this, the teacher gave the boy her mobile number and ordered him to delete their conversations. Devastated, the girl informed school officials of the pair's exchanges, and confronted her boyfriend. According to the school's report, Eng admitted having oral sex and intercourse with Sayar between eight to 12 times. The New York Post reports that the lovers exchanged an incredible 3,856 text messages over a 17-day period in December, an average of 227 per day. Allegations: She is accused of having sex with 16-year-old pupil Kevin Eng in her office at James Madison High School . One midnight tryst apparently saw Sayar pick the boy up from his house in her car. 'Eventually, they began kissing and then engaged in sexual intercourse and oral sex inside the SUV,' the report said, adding that the boy had described tattoos on intimate parts of Sayar’s body. A spokesman for the Department of . Education said Sayar, who earns just over $78,000 (£50,000) a year, is . still technically employed at the school, although she was removed from . the classroom in January. 'We had weight training every day in . sixth period, but instead of going to the weight room, Kevin was going . to her office - and the door was locked' The school investigators have submitted their report to Brooklyn's District Attorney Charles Hynes, strongly recommending she be fired. Eng, who is now 17, is still a pupil at the school. The sordid allegations are not the first to hit James Madison High School, christened 'Horndog High' after its past sex scandals. Language teachers Cindy Mauro and Alini Brito were dismissed from their posts after an alleged lesbian romp in a school classroom in November 2009 - a claim they both denied. Prior to that, 29-year-old English teacher Craig Roffman was sacked and arrested in 2005 after he was found emailing child pornography.","Alleged affair uncovered when 16-year-old's girlfriend hacked his Facebook account .

She said: 'I ran over to the house because I knew Shannon was there - she was in the garden lying on the ground covered in blood. 'To hear your daughter scream like that is just awful, there was blood pouring from five different wounds. 'I picked her up and held her in my arms, I felt sick and couldn’t stop shaking - I nearly dropped her because I was shaking that much. Pain: Shannon had bites under her eye and some of the skin came off her nose. The dog has been seized . 'She was really badly injured. She had bites under her eye, some skin had come off on her nose and her chin was really bad too. 'Shannon kept dosing off, I was worried she was losing too much blood, I didn’t know what was going to happen to her.' The father of Shannon’s friend pulled the dog off Shannon after witnessing the attack by their normally placid, family pet. Sharon Scholes was delivering leaflets which she heard screams coming from the house Shannon was at and rushed to her daughter . Ms Scholes, a school supervisor said: 'I wanted to care for my poor daughter and make everything okay but it was hard to be in the same room as her and see her horrific injuries.' Police seized the Akita at the time of the attack, and will hold the dog until a decision has been made on whether it should be destroyed. The owners of the dog have not made any contact to check how Shannon is, nor apologised for what the damage their pet caused, it has been claimed. Shannon has been left with a swollen and bruised face, even a month after the attack, and has a large scar under her eye. The youngster's family said she had never seen her father, Karl Rennie, cry before until he saw her lying in a hospital bed. The decorator, 36, said: 'When I saw her, I just broke down. 'It made me feel sick what had happened to her - I was by her bedside everyday while she was in hospital. 'Whenever I see a dog now, I’m really wary now I know first-hand what they are capable of. 'I think it’s really disrespectful that the family haven’t taken any responsibility for their dog or apologised to Shannon for what it did to her. 'Shannon is so fragile but we have just got to appreciate that it wasn’t any worse and that’s still with us today.' As the incident happened on private property, no criminal prosecution can be made against the owner - something which angers Ms Scholes. She said: 'It has upset me - the injuries my daughter suffered were horrific and yet apparently there’s nothing anyone can do. Something more should be done.'

Looking across the rows of tents and the high-wire fence, you could be forgiven for thinking you are looking over a prisoner of war camp or a refugee settlement awaiting an influx of people from a conflict zone. But, complete with armed guards and untidy surroundings this is the scene that greeted hundreds of England football fans as they arrived in Donetsk, Ukraine, ahead of England's opening Euro 2012 group game on Monday. The lines of white tents where fans who have been priced out of the town's hotels are staying are in stark contrast to the England team's luxury hotel in the centre of the Polish capital, Krakow. No, it's not a refugee camp, it's an English fan compound in Donetsk, Ukraine . Welcoming? One of the signs greeting people as they arrive at the camp says: 'It was cool being with you guys! Come back soon!' It's hardly a Roman piazza, but at least if you get into the VIP section you get some shade from the sun in one of the open squares . Final preparations being made on the camp ahead of the start of Euro 2012 . Polish fans who staged running battles with their Russian counterparts before and after the two teams met have warned England fans that they are next. They have told English supporters to expect worse than the violence seen on the streets of Warsaw on Tuesday. Police said that of the 184 arrested following the violence, 156 were Polish. Last night warnings posted on the internet suggested that the thugs now had English supporters in their sights, apparently in revenge for the way their countrymen living in the UK are treated. One supporter revealed how a Polish football fan he met ont he plane told him how they would be targeted, according to the Daily Star. He said: 'The guy said many of the ultra groups in Poland were planning to join together and attack English supporters in retaliation over how Poles are treated in the UK.' On Tuesday it took more than 5,000 riot police armed with water cannon, tear gas and rubber bullets to quell the violence which started as more than 5,000 fans marched through the Polish capital to mark Russia Day. it was seen as a provocative gesture by Poles who were ruled for decades from Moscow under the old Soviet rule. At £100 a night for a three-man . berth, the price is a little steep, but still cheaper than the hotels in . the centre of Donetsk, home of the stadium where England drew 1-1 with France on Monday night. The . campsite, with capacity for 1,000 people, is manned by a military guard who is less welcoming than the . entrance sign that reads 'It was cool being with you guys! Come back . soon!'. Despite the . security presence, however, it hardly takes the Great Escape wherewithal . of RAF Squadron Leader Roger Bushell to figure out who to get past the . mesh barrier. One fan told the Guardian: 'It's not hard to get over that fence if you fancy a rob.' At . the centre of the camp there is an unshaded square (unless you go for a . VIP tent, then you're provided at least with some rest from the sun). It's . hardly a Roman piazza or a French carré, but it serves its purpose, . namely it's somewhere to sit together, shirtless, eating from fast food . stalls, and drinking from beer tents dotted around the camp. It may be surprising, but there are actually three categories of accommodation from the basic to the 'luxury'. The basic one is a tent. For those wanting a more relaxing place to sleep a sleeping bag will be provided. But . for those feeling flush and really wanting to get a good night's sleep . there is a tent in which you can stand up - at full height - with actual . beds, which actually look more like gazebos you might put up in your back garden. It was a bit of a last-minute dash to build the final 150 of 250 tents on the site, but the job was done and it was home to 1,000 fans . Jake Danna shows off his England shirt in his 'luxury' tent - luxury because he can stand up at full height . Oh, the luxury: Fans Paul Motion, Shaun Weise, and Shamajul Motin relax in the VIP section . Donetsk was actually founded by Welsh businessman, John Hughes, who started up a steel plant and several coal mines. The city has a population of nearly 1million people and the main industry is still based on coal mining. For . anyone wanting to do anything other than watch the football there is a . boulevard that stretches 1.24miles with cafes, fountains and an . interesting array of statues. There is also the Donbass Palace, now a five-star hotel, and Donetsk Opera and Ballet Theatre. The . main tourist street, however, is First Line Avenue which has hotels, . parks, shops and restaurants, all housed in varying architecture. There is also a nod to the town's founder -  monument in front of the Donetsk National Technical University. Included in the cost is the washing of linen, showers, toilets, and electricity for people to charge their mobile phones. Another . fan added before England's first game: 'It's about what we expected. We . heard the stories but there weren't any hotels at all in Donetsk, they . just all went. That's why we're here. It could be better for sure. I . have no idea how we're going to get into town.' But those who have made it out this far would appear to be among the few - as the opening game against France was played out against a backdrop of a stadium that appeared at least a quarter empty. It is thought that the cost of travel and accommodation, and security fears kept many away. And the sight of this camp, and Tuesday's violence between Polish and Russian fans, the fears would seem to have been realised. The problem has been so marked that tickets for England's final group game against the hosts that originally went on sale for £40 are being sold for £14. Just 4,000 of the allocation of 9,000 tickets for England fans have been taken up, which will result in the poorest attendance at any major championship for years. Russian fans will outnumber their English equivalents in the stadium for the match against Ukraine. Fans' accommodation is quite different to Hotel Stary in Krakow where England's players are staying . England fans aseembled at the Golden Lion Pub ahead of Monday's opening game against France . England's next game is tomorrow night . in Kiev against Sweden, knowing that a win will go a long way to . helping them secure a quarter-final place. Those remaining in Donetsk, hoping that England will be . playing there again in the quarter-finals, will have to content . themselves with watching the game on TV. Some who remained back in England, . however, are not being allowed to watch the game after being told they . had to work through it - despite being a 7.45 kick-off. In fact, bosses at one of the national team's mains sponsors have provoked anger by banning staff from watching England's games. Vauxhall factory workers were banned . from watching Monday's draw with France and have been told that they . cannot see tomorrow evening's game against Sweden because it would . 'breach health and safety regulations'. One worker at the company's Luton . plant told The Sun: 'Our company is the main sponsor for England yet . when it comes to matches we aren't even allowed to watch. We're gutted.' Fans dressed as knights enjoy all that Kiev has to offer . On the ball: Steven Gerrard, John Terry and Stewart downing train in the rain ahead of tomorrow night's crucial game against Sweden . Russia have the threat of a six-point deduction hanging over them during qualification for the next European Championship in France in 2016. UEFA handed out the punishment for the violence inside Wroclaw’s stadium during and after last Friday’s game against the Czech Republic. They also fined Russia £96,000. The hosts of the World Cup finals in 2018 say they will appeal. Russian fans attacked stewards at Wroclaw¿s stadium following their opening game on Friday night . The punishment does not relate to the violence between Russian and Polish fans in Warsaw on Tuesday, but last night UEFA said they would investigate that trouble. If found guilty over the fan violence that led to 24 injuries and more than 180 arrests, Russia could find the suspended six-point deduction imposed immediately. Russian FA president Sergey Fursenko said: ‘We want to submit an appeal against the punishment given. It is a shame that the team answers for the ill-considered actions and words of the fans.’ FA’s honorary president Vyacheslav Koloskov added: ‘Six points is complete nonsense. I think this decision is aimed at discrediting Russian football in general.’","Supporters who flew to Donetsk for England's opening game were put up in row upon row of basic white tents .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 01:16 EST, 9 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 01:41 EST, 9 June 2012 . A private investigator helping in the case of missing Louisiana college student Michaela ‘Mickey’ Shunick believes that he may have information about a possible suspect. John Abdella, who was hired by private donors to solve the mystery, said since last Monday, he has received 265 calls related to Shunick’s disappearance. About five days ago, Abdella said two independent sources who do not know each other phoned in tips describing the same person. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Vanished: Miss Shunick, 22, was last seen riding her bike home from a friend's house in the early hours when she disappeared . ‘Their description was almost identical,’ Abdella told TV station KATC. ‘They appear to be very credible and . they appear to be very knowledgeable,’ he continued. ‘And I thought it . was more than coincidental that both of their descriptions were the . same.’ P.I.: John Abdella said he has received 265 calls about the Shunick case, including two credible leads . The private investigator said he plans to meet with police to share his information about the leads. ‘Hopefully, it takes us somewhere in the next couple of days,’ said Shunick’s sister, Charlie. ‘Everything we are doing, everything . that’s going on here, everything people are doing is to find Mickey. It . has nothing to do with anything else. Our goal is to find my sister,’ Charlie Shunick added. Evidence: . The recovered bike belonging to missing student Mickey Shunick since May 19 was found with significant damage suggesting a possible hit and run police say . Abdella said he believes that the Lafayette police are working hard to find Shunick, aged 22, who disappeared in May while riding her bicycle home from her friend’s house in the middle of the night. Shunick’s bicycle was found on May 30 badly mangled under a bridge about 30 minutes from the spot where she disappeared. At the time, police suggested that she may have been hit by a car. ‘It’s a very active investigation,’ said Abdella. ‘And I think the police are very, very active, they are putting in a lot of manpower, they’re spending a lot of overtime.’ Discovery: Just over a week after she vanished her bike was discovered beneath this bridge, 27 miles from where she was last seen, with police initially tight-lipped on its found condition . Tire marks: Near the bike, police also say they found tire marks from a vehicle that was driving off the road's side leading police to believe the vehicle placed the bike there . On the day Shunick's bike was found, police have . also revealed their discovery of off-road tire tracks nearby. 'We strongly believe that the person, or perpetrator, drove down to the edge of the water and dumped the bike into the water for it not to be found, Cpl. Paul Mouton, of the Lafayette Police Department, told ABC. Police report that they're currently searching for the drivers of three vehicles seen passing around the same time and area she was seen riding in security footage. The vehicles are a white pickup truck with a bed cover, a white four-door Chevy Z71 truck, and an older model sedan. Possible suspects: Lafayette police are currently searching for the drivers of these three vehicles seen passing around the same time and area Mickey Shunick was last seen . Same location: Visible in the top right of the video grab is Miss Shunick seen riding her bike home in the same area and time the three vehicles were seen passing . Two videos show the University of Louisiana student on St John Street and St Landry Street in Lafayette date from 1.47am and 1.48am when the student had left a friend's house. It was over a week after her disappearance that fishermen found her bike at Whiskey Bay on the Atchafalaya River, Louisiana. Her family were brought to the scene by police and confirmed it was her black and gold Schwinn. The bike's condition was initially not released while authorities began searching the river by boat with divers planned when the current became less strong. DNA testing: Police hope that forensic tests on her bike's handlebars, frame and grips will find DNA evidence to any potential suspects in her disappearance . Investigators had found no cell phone or purse of the missing woman after she left her friend Brettly Wilson's house. And as investigators expanded their search to include a $25,000 reward for information, some people in the area began to wonder whether she had even been abducted. Reward: While search efforts have been called off among her friends, a . $25,000 reward has been issued for any information leading to her . whereabouts . While hundreds of University of . Louisiana students and some of Shunick's friends have been helping the . police with their searches, the night she went missing still plays on . minds. 'It's something you . keeping asking ourselves, if there's something that we overlooked or . something that we missed,' said Brettley Wilson. Painting a clearer timeline of the . evening, police are keen for witnesses to come forward from the . Artmosphere bar that Shunick attended from 10pm till midnight and then . onwards to Wilson's house and to a Taco Bell drive-thru at around 1.24am. Receiving a phone call from a friend at around 1.31 am, Wilson drove Shunick to his home to collect her bike and she rode off at 1.45 am leaving Wilson. Support: The community in Lafayette attend a vigil to pray for the missing student . 'She checked her bike, took out her . mace, made sure it was on. I walked her out, watched her get to the . drive way then I closed the door and locked it,' said Wilson according . to KATC . That was the last time that anyone saw her. 'Now we're able to show the family . that, hey, we know she traveled to Versaille, we know she made it as far . as St.Landry Street, and that there was a white pick up truck in that . area,' said Corporal Paul Mouton, Public Information Officer for . Lafayette Police. 'Someone was in that immediate area when she passed on the bike so it's trying to identify with those people and getting that information back so we can hopefully get closer to finding her.' Indeed, after seeing the white pick-up truck released by the police, new leads are already coming forward. Shine a light: Friends and fellow students gathered in a park in downtown Lafayette to support Mickey's family in the search for her . Hope: Large-scale search efforts for Mickey, seen here (right) with her sister, have concluded while family and friends remain hopeful for her recovery . A local girl, Tasha Patterson claims . that it is the same truck that approached her two months ago while she . was riding her bike down South College around 2 pm. She says that after heading back from a meeting a man in a white truck pulled over and asked if she needed a ride. Patterson says she was exhausted and was not thinking clearly and got in. Throughout the car ride the man apparently offered her money in return for sex, an offer which she refused. Dropping her off unharmed, Patterson described the truck as a white GMC Sierra 2500 Texas Edition and during the journey told her matter-of-factly that: 'He rides around town all the time trying to pick up pretty girls'. The driver was described as white, heavyset and in his 50's or 60's. Watch the video here: .","Investigator John Abdella said leads were provided by two separate sources .

Fun-loving and mischievous: Tyler Whelan was killed after being kicked across a room and into a door, rupturing his abdomen . A mother whose violent partner murdered her son was jailed for four years for allowing his death. Little Tyler Whelan was kicked so hard by his stepfather that he flew two feet through the air, hitting a door, while his mother Stephanie Whelan was taking two other children to school. The five year-old’s abdomen was ruptured in the attack in his home in Paston, near Peterborough, and the injury slowly killed him. Elvis Lee, 34, has been jailed for a minimum of 17 years for murdering Tyler. At Reading Crown Court on Thursday, Mr Justice Nicol sentenced Tyler’s mother to four years in jail. During an earlier trial at Cambridge Crown Court the 27-year-old was found guilty of allowing the boy’s death. Mr Justice Nicol said: 'On the morning of March 7, 2011, you left Tyler alone with Elvis Lee while you took your daughter and another young girl to school. 'During the 40 minutes that you were out of the house, Elvis Lee kicked Tyler in the abdomen and kicked him so hard that he flew two feet in the air. 'The kick ruptured Tyler’s small bowel and this substantially contributed to his death about two hours later. The jury found that Elvis Lee had murdered Tyler.' He added: 'You knew that Elvis Lee was a violent man. You knew that for some 14 months he had been undergoing an anger management course. Sorry tale: Elvis Lee, left, was found guilty of murder while Tyler's mother, Stephanie Whelan was found guilty and has been jailed for allowing his death . 'You knew that this had not resulted in him mending his ways. You knew that because only six weeks before the death of Tyler, Elvis Lee had assaulted you.' During the trial the jury heard Whelan and Lee say they found Tyler face down on the floor after falling from the breakfast bar. Lee launched the fateful attack on his . stepson after being left with the boy on March 7 last year while his . mother took her daughter and his daughter to school and arranged a . doctor’s appointment. In June 2010, a year before he died, Tyler was taken to hospital with a fractured leg. His . mother said he had fallen up some stairs but paediatric registrars . referred the case to social services over other bruising to his body. Children's services said there was no risk and his injuries were from a genuine accident. In . September that year he was in hospital again after falling off a bike. Again social services were told about the incident and again they deemed . it to be from a genuine accident. On . February 2011 teachers raised concerns over what they thought to be a . radiator burn. Tyler's mother said he was accident prone. He was taken . to see a GP but there was no further action. Head . of children's services at Peterborough City Council, councillor Sheila . Scott said: 'It was a single violent assault that led to his death and . the perpetrator has now been brought to justice. Malcolm . Newsam, Executive Director of Children's Services, said: 'There were . certainly missed opportunities when intervention should have been more . rigorous.' A serious case review found it was not possible to say with certainty that Tyler's death was predictable or preventable. Mr . Newsam added: 'Nonetheless the service we offered Tyler was not good . enough and we offer our sincere apologies to his extended family for . that failing.' The neglectful mum was gone for just half an hour but by the time she returned the violent child murderer had kicked Tyler hard enough to cause fatal injuries. Lee then sat the wounded child in front of a bowl of cereal to make the scene look normal when his partner returned, the court heard. However, once Whelan, who worked as a cleaner during her trial, came home she realised something was wrong and they took the boy to hospital by car. The court heard how she made a panicked 999 call on the way in which her distress was 'palpable', but it was too late to save little Tyler who died tragically inside the vehicle. Six weeks earlier Lee had kicked her in the face as she lay on the ground leaving her with a swollen eye and needing hospital treatment. The trial heard evidence that Tyler suffered a shopping list of 'non-accidental' injuries in the year before his death. A report published after the conviction of Lee found that key opportunities to protect Tyler were missed by authorities tasked with his care. It acknowledged previous incidents in which the boy was hurt had been 'seen in isolation' with 'minimal attempts to link concerning patterns of injuries'. Michael Burrows, defending Whelan, said: 'This is obviously a hugely tragic case. 'A young boy was murdered and his mother, who the prosecution accepted liked him, and who the jury found had otherwise cared for Tyler properly, has been held partly responsible for his death. 'For that she has to be sentenced. 'It was on one occasion she left home with a man who had previously been violent to her some six weeks before but who have not been violent to Tyler.' He added: 'She left Tyler with him for just half an hour or so, not for selfish reasons, not for her own benefit in any way, but rather to take her daughter and in fact his daughter to school and to make an appointment for Tyler to be seen by a doctor later that morning.'","Little Tyler Whelan's mother Stephanie Whelan was taking two other children to school .

Student Philippa Dorries, who already has a lucrative part-time job as her mother's House of Commons office manager, has been seeing Mr Kelly, 34, for 'several months', as revealed by Richard Kay. The 27-year-old law student's new partner is the handsome Conservative MP for Dudley South, while his father owns lorry firm Keltruck, the largest independent Scania dealership in the world. New man: Philippa Dorries, left, and tory MP Chris Kelly have been dating for 'several months' Blonde Philippa also received £40,000 a year while employed as Mrs Dorries' House of Commons office manager, a job the Tory MP says she has had for four years. Mr Kelly, meanwhile, also tops up his £65,000-a-year MP's salary by earning up to £4,000 a month working for his father's company. Conservative MP Mrs Dorries has defended her employment of her daughter as her House of Commons office manager . Last year, he earned more than £25,000 with Keltruck for just 16 hours a month. This may have helped him acquire a £30,000 BMW coupe, complete with personalised number plate, which is the envy of the Commons' car park. The pair are said to have been dating for several months and have been seen together at social events in Mr Kelly's constituency. Philippa is studying her final law exams at BPP college in London. Last year anti-Euro MP Mr Kelly was reportedly reduced to tears after being caught in the crossfire between his millionaire father, also called Chris, and a furious David Cameron over a vote to stop Brussels gaining more power over Britain. Mr Kelly  was among several anti-EU Tories subjected to a four-letter onslaught by Mr Cameron as he battled to curb revolt over Europe’s ability to meddle with Parliamentary sovereignty. After it emerged that she employed her own daughter, Mrs Dorries denied any wrongdoing. She said her daughter has worked for her for four years as an office manager, and that for the past two years, while she studied, Philippa had her pay reduced to reflect the hours when she attends lectures. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority has been informed, says Nadine.","Philippa Dorries, 27, also has £40,000-a-year part-time job as her mother's House of Commons office manager .

Medium: Karl Lang is accused of persuading the woman to strip naked during a séance as it would increase her spiritual powers . A self-styled psychic who persuaded women to strip to enhance their chances of contacting the dead told a client to perform ‘like a porn star’, a court has heard. Karl Lang is said to have ‘brainwashed’ two victims into believing being naked would increase their spiritual abilities. One of them, aged 26, told a court she felt ‘embarrassed and ashamed’ that she was fooled into taking part in nude séances. Giving evidence by live video link to avoid seeing 49-year-old Lang in the dock, she said she had been desperate to make contact with her grandfather. Describing Lang’s alleged method of improving her spiritual power, she said: ‘To get stronger, he told me I had to do things that mankind was afraid of. ‘This meant I had to get naked and perform a bit like a porn star. He said the more outrageous I performed, the stronger I would become.’ The woman, who first visited Lang when she was 19, carried on the sessions for more than three years, during which time she was instructed on reaching higher levels of ability, described in terms of ‘levels’ and ‘colours’. She said: ‘If you didn’t dance to his tune, all hell would break loose. Bad things would happen. I’d lose my colours if I didn’t do what he wanted.’ The woman continued: ‘Thinking about it now it makes me feel sick. I’m embarrassed and ashamed about what I had to do, but I was completely controlled. He mentally abused me. ‘I met Karl at a very vulnerable stage in my life. He made me feel special. His eyes were warming and he made me feel safe and comfortable. I saw Karl as my saviour.’ She added: ‘After Karl was arrested, he rang me and begged me not to say anything. He said, “I’m big time in the s***, please don’t hang me”.’ Lang, of Newport, South Wales, is accused of tricking the two women into carrying out sexual acts during the séance sessions. Newport Crown Court has heard they were also told to send him naked pictures of themselves on their phones. The other victim, now 27, said: ‘The first time I stripped off my clothes he said “Well done! You’ve gone up a level in the spiritual world”. He told me the more outrageous I behaved, the higher level I would get. It was like a reward system.’ Trial: Lang, of Newport, South Wales, (Newport Crown Court is pictured) is . accused of being a 'sexual fraudster' to trick two women into sexual . acts during séance sessions . On one occasion after obeying his . sexually explicit instructions, she told the court: ‘Karl congratulated . me by saying: “I didn’t think you had it in you – you really pleased the . spirit world”. I felt uncomfortable.’ She added: ‘He asked me to talk about . my sexual fantasies during meditations. I would be naked with my eyes . closed. He told me to imagine having sex. He said: “Be as outrageous as . you want, don’t just have one man, have five”.’ The alleged victim contacted Lang in . an attempt to get in touch with her father, who died ten years ago. She . later told police she felt ‘brainwashed, manipulated and groomed’. The court heard that Lang had warned . the woman not to tell anyone about his methods because he was the . ‘reincarnation of Jesus Christ’. He told police he was ‘totally . shocked’ when one of his alleged victims stripped in one of his . sessions. He denied asking them to strip, perform sex acts on themselves . and send him explicit photos, describing their evidence as ‘wicked . lies’.

Wearing a tight fitting black pencil dress with four inch Christian Louboutin heels the weary-looking Rebekah Brooks arrived at Southwark Crown Court for the first hearing . They were once the king and princess of a blossoming media empire. But the lives of Rupert Murdoch and Rebekah Brooks now couldn't have appeared further apart. While she appeared in court charged with perverting the course of justice today, the News Corp mogul appeared without a care in the world as he soaked up the sun aboard a gondola on a family holiday in Venice last week. Wearing a tight-fitting black pencil dress with four-inch Christian Louboutin heels, the 44-year old looked weary as she arrived at Southwark Crown Court with husband Charlie to be told she may be charged with further offences in relation to Scotland Yard's probe into phone hacking. But for the global media mogul, who is now in New York, the plight of his flame-haired former protegee appeared but a distant memory as he relaxed 1,000 miles away on his family holiday. He strolled the sun-drenched Venetian canal walks, laughing with wife Wendi Deng and their young daughters, Grace Helen, 11, and nine-year-old Chloe. They even had time to relax on his £190,000 Rosehearty superyacht in the crystal waters of the Mediterranean Sea. Back in London, Mrs Brooks sat stoney faced with Charlie and their four co-defendants. A trial date for the allegations that she hid documents and computers from detectives investigating hacking and bribing public officials was not set after the court heard that she is due to learn if she is to be charged with further offences in relation to the Met's Operation Weeting. Brooks, her husband Charlie and four of her former entourage are now not expected to indicate their pleas until September after she answers bail to hear her fate in relation to the other allegations. The 44-year-old listened intently as the dates for the case against her were set down in the courtroom packed with journalists'. Scroll down for video.

Carter, 48, News Internationals Head of Security Mark Hanna, 49, her . ex-chauffeur Paul Edwards, 48, security consultant Daryl Jorsling, 39. They are the first to face court over the hacking scandal. Brooks . schemed to remove boxes of archive records from the Murdoch company . headquarters, concealed material and hid documents, computers and other . electronic equipment from detectives investigating both phone hacking . and the bribery of public officials, it is claimed. She faces three charges of perverting the course of justice while the other four in the crowded dock face a single charge each.

Worlds apart: Back in London, Mrs Brooks faced the media circus that has followed her since being charged with plotting to pervert the course of justice in May . Together: The former queen of Rupert Murdoch's UK newspaper empire arrived with her racehorse trainer husband Charlie . Trial Judge Mr Justice Fulford agreed: 'You need to know if this trial as it is currently constituted is going to take place.' Mr . Edis said they hoped for a decision on further charges by August 22 but . could not guarantee it and may need to extend the time. He added: 'We . are confident that the decision will be taken in time for this case to . proceed smoothly.' The PA and the security chief: Mrs Brooks' former PA Cheryl Carter and NI's former head of security Mark Hanna arrive at Southwark Crown Court to face their single charges of conspiring to pervert the course of justice . Brooks . has hired Hugo Keith QC who represented the coroner at the 7/7 inquest . and the government in the Shrien Dewani extradition hearing to represent . her. He pointed out that it is not known for sure that any of the files relating to 11 journalists handed by Operation Weeting . detectives related to Brooks. Well turned out: Rebekah Brooks looked a far cry from the smiling and confident power dresser that strode into Westminster Magistrates' Court a fortnight ago for the first hearing (above) He handed a bundle of press cuttings . to the judge for his attention, explaining: 'There have been certain . sites, blogs and the like where there has been some extremely offensive, . unpleasant and prejudical commentary.' The first charge relating to the . current case alleges that between July 6 and 19 last year she conspired . with her husband, Carter, 48, News Internationals Head of Security Mark . Hanna, 49, her chauffeur Paul Edwards, 48, her security consultant Daryl . Jorsling, 39, and others to conceal material from officers of the . Metropolitan Police Service. The second charge claims that she and Carter between July 6 and 9 2011 conspired to remove seven boxes of material from the New International archives. The final charge alleges that Brooks and her husband along with Hanna, Edwards, Jorsling, and others conspired to conceal documents, computers and other electronic equipment from Met officers between July 15 and 19 2011. Although all six are named in the first charge only Brooks is facing prosecution in relation to it. She sat on the end of the row in the dock next to her husband Charlie, who went to Eton with Prime Minister David Cameron who was a close friend of the couple and they chatted and laughed as they waited for the judge. Wearing a navy suit with a white shirt and pink he stared at the judge and made brief notes during the 30 minute hearing. In a public statement after they were charged the couple, of Churchill, Oxfordshire, condemned the decision as a 'witch hunt' and said they would fight the charges.

Brooks edited the News of the World from 2000 before taking the helm at The Sun in 2003. In 2009 she became chief executive of News International then quit her post last July in the same month the alleged criminality took place. Days after she quit she was arrested over allegations of phone-hacking and corruption after a bag containing a laptop, iPhone and paperwork was found in a bin near her £1.5 million home in London's exclusive Chelsea Harbour. In the same month Murdoch closed down the News of the World after public fury over allegations the paper had hacked the email of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler. Newspaper bosses are facing more damages claims following allegations that tabloid journalists hacked phones, a High Court judge heard today. A lawyer told Mr Justice Vos that 50 claims against News Group Newspapers are currently itemised on a register. But he indicated that about 20 more claims are set to be added to that list. Dozens sued in the wake of allegations that journalists at the now-defunct News of the World newspaper, which was owned by News Group, hacked phones. A trial is scheduled to start at the High Court in London in February. Hugh Tomlinson QC, who represents a number of claimants seeking damages, outlined the latest damages claims at a High Court hearing in London. 'There are 50 issued claims,' he said. 'I understand that there are another 20-odd about to be placed on the register.' Meanwhile, the High Court was today told News International lawyers are examining iPhones thought to have been used by company executives. A barrister representing claimants said the existence of the News International iPhones emerged as a result of evidence given to the Leveson Inquiry. David Sherborne told Mr Justice Vos that evidence was 'contrary' to previous evidence given to the High Court. Mr Justice Vos said 'new' material found on the iPhones should be disclosed. He told lawyers: 'If there is material that is new or is likely to be new then it should be disclosed.' No detail was given in court about the iPhones or their users. Mr Justice Vos was told about the iPhones at a hearing earlier this month. Lawyers representing claimants said evidence suggested that the iPhones were used 'during the relevant period'. The judge said who used the iPhones and what they were used for would be 'open for discussion'.

When garden enthusiast Vera Shallcross planted a rare wild flower display on a roadside near her home, she had hoped the colourful gesture would brighten up the grass verge for decades to come. But she had not reckoned with workmen from her local council who - despite the display flourishing for ten years - opted to destroy the swathe of meadow flowers by mowing them all down. Former Britain in Bloom judge Vera 76, planted the pretty display with a group of friends to brighten up the verge of the A534 in Sandbach, Cheshire, in 2002. Hacked off: Vera Shallcross nurtured the flower display for a decade, only for council workmen to mow it down . In bloom: Other sections of the same road in Sandbach have remained untouched and make a colourful addition to the roadside . The retired shopkeeper recruited friends and spent hours planting the meadow flowers, having been inspired by similar verges in France and Morocco. But 10 years after the wild display was unveiled, contractors working for Cheshire East Council destroyed the entire bank in just two hours. Thousands of flowers were hacked down including hundreds which were designated as ‘rare’. Vera yesterday raged against the local authority for 'decimating' the flowers. She said: 'We wanted the roads to be strewn with wild flowers and we were trying to bring something new to Sandbach. 'We took inspiration from around the world, with wild flowers blooming in France and Morocco. 'I am disappointed and saddened by the decimation of the wild flowers on the road. 'A few years ago, a very small dedicated group of people, encouraged by the highways department of Congleton Borough Council, were leaders in this conservation project. 'We used to do the Sandbach in Bloom and the civic awards, so I can’t understand why have these flowers been destroyed.' Vera, from Sandbach, and her group of friends raised hundreds of pounds for the seeds by selling wheelbarrows in 2002. Cut down in their prime: Vera said the rare flowers she had planted ten years ago were just starting to flourish when they were hacked down by the council .

'It was a spectacularly colourful display of meadow flowers which received much admiration.' 'It is very poor if they are going to destroy them. I think it is sad to see and that whole area looks so barren.' A council spokesman said: 'Cheshire East Highways’ grass cutting policy must strike a balance between maintaining natural roadside environments and ensuring the roads are visibly safe for motorists.

Attack: Len McCluskey, general secretary of Unite warns Labour to prepare for an early general election . The leader of the country's biggest trade union has warned of more co-ordinated strikes across Britain as anger mounts over pay freezes and job cuts - on the same day more than 50,000 Revenue and Customs workers are downing tools in protest at 'massive cuts'. Len McCluskey, general secretary of . Unite, warned that industrial action over pay, pensions and cuts to . public services is 'inevitable' and will continue until the next polling day. He has urged Labour to prepare for an early . general election because of the continuing economic uncertainty and . anger over the Government's policies. Meanwhile, members of the Public and . Commercial Services union (PCS) are striking today claiming job cuts are undermining efforts to clamp down on tax avoidance schemes. They will take action across the UK, warning . that the walkout will close offices and leave telephone calls . unanswered. It comes as it emerged HMRC doesn't have the resources to deal with more than 20,0000 tax tribunal cases where billions of pounds of potential revenue is tied up. The backlog is so huge it will take 38 years to clear at the current rate, according to The Times. In the past year there have been a series of national strikes held by public sector workers, while teachers are threatening co-ordinated action in the autumn and doctors took industrial action last week for the first time in almost 40 years, while police and prison officers have also staged demonstrations. 'This campaign will run and run, probably up to the next election,' said Mr McCluskey ahead of Unite's national conference which opens in Brighton on Monday. 'Governments that don't listen to the concerns of ordinary people tend to get turfed out of office. There will be further campaigns and further strikes and all this will be a major issue at the next election.' He told the BBC that further strikes were 'inevitable'. Mr McCluskey said Labour has to 'get its act together' and prepare for a general election in 2014, a year earlier than the next poll is due. 'The Labour Party would be sensible to prepare for an election. These are extraordinary times - none of us have been here before, no-one knows what is around the corner. 'Anything can happen, but I hope people don't forget the ineptitude of this government and the blame they are trying to put on workers for the economic crisis.' Strike: Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the PCS union on the picket line at the Houses of Parliament during the protest over pensions last year . Mr McCluskey who will make his keynote speech to delegates on Monday, said workers desperately needed hope amid the government's austerity measures and 'attacks' on public services, adding it was 'frightening' that most of the spending cuts haven't been implemented yet. He said the 'attack' on millions of hardworking families is 'forfeiting the (government's right to rule'. He urged Labour leader Ed Miliband, who addresses the conference later this week, to give details of the party's alternative to the government's policies. Unite has been involved in a spate of industrial disputes this year involving fuel tanker drivers, public sector workers and London bus drivers, who went on strike on Friday in a row over an Olympic bonus payment. 'It can only get worse,' added the Unite leader. The PCS union say job cuts are undermining efforts to investigate tax avoidance schemes like the one used by comedian Jimmy Carr . The PCS union said 30,000 jobs have been axed since 2005 and a further 10,000 are set to go, 'undermining' efforts to investigate schemes such as the one used by comedian Jimmy Carr, which sparked a political row last week. The PCS said an estimated £120 billion was lost every year because of tax evasion and avoidance, claiming that HMRC did not have enough resources to tackle the problem. The strike is also in opposition to 'creeping privatisation' in the department, which is currently trialling the use of private firms to handle tax credit inquiries. The strike will be followed by other forms of action such as a ban on overtime. PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka said: 'It is sickening to see millionaires in the cabinet wringing their hands about the immorality of tax avoidance when it is their lack of political will to act that means we lose tens of billions of pounds every year. 'The case for investment in our public services as an alternative to austerity could not be more obvious than it is in HMRC. Yet the government wants to cut 10,000 more jobs from the department, letting the wealthy tax dodgers off the hook and punishing the rest of us for a recession we did not cause.' An HM Revenue & Customs spokesman said: 'HMRC is disappointed with the decision to strike and will do everything it can to maintain services to the public. Upset: Protesters march with placards in London in November last year when more than two million public sector workers staged a nationwide strike . 'We are seeking dialogue with the PCS to address their concerns and will work to minimise any disruption to our customers. 'In our 2010 spending review the Government made £917m available to us to tackle avoidance, evasion and fraud. 'This is being used to increase our tax take from compliance work by £7bn a year in 2014/15 which we are on target to do. 'Last year alone we increased the yield from our compliance work to £13.9bn.'","Len McCluskey has urged Labour to prepare for an early general election .

Russian President Vladimir Putin is due to visit Ukraine on July 12 for a meeting with Yanukovich in Yalta on gas supplies when the language law seems certain to crop up in conversation. But given the level of protest, it is by no means certain that Yanukovich will sign the bill into law even though it will be popular in his power base in the east of the country.

Samantha Mawtus, pictured leaving Guildford Crown Court where she is on trial for conspiracy to commit robbery . A barmaid who was tied up as masked men ransacked the golf club where she worked in a night-time raid was actually the girlfriend of one of the robbers and helped plan the attack, a trial heard. Managers of the prestigious Pine Ridge Golf Club had nothing but sympathy for Samantha Mawtus, who said she had been put through the terrifying ordeal. Mawtus, 27, was given a week off to recover from the break-in but police inquiries soon led back to the mother-of-two when her boyfriend was arrested with another man. Police believe the barmaid helped plan the night raid with the pair. She has denied conspiracy to commit robbery at Guildford Crown Court. However, she claims she was ‘deceived’ by her boyfriend Mitchell Laidlaw, 25, from Liverpool, and his accomplice Kieran Beatty, 23, from Maidstone, Kent who have both pleaded guilty to conspiracy to rob the club on March 20 last year. But Nicola Merrick, prosecuting, . said: ‘Miss Mawtus made an agreement or plan with the two men to commit . robbery at the club that night. ‘She was often short of money.’ She . said on the evening of the robbery, the defendant had switched shifts . with another staff member which meant that she was working at the club . in Camberley, Surrey, on the crucial night. Her supervisor Simon Price, was in charge of the bar and allowed the barmaid to have a cigarette outside, leaving him alone. But just minutes later a stranger came in through the same door wearing a balaclava and wielding a baseball bat. Nicole Merrick said: ‘At first, Mr Price thought it was a joke. But the man soon made it clear that it was anything but.’ Ms Merrick said the robber forced Mr Price to empty the till of £330 before forcing him to leave the building. The . terrified barman was then dragged to a nearby wood, tied to tree and . had his mouth taped to ensure he wouldn’t raise the alarm. But 20 minutes later he was able . to free himself and run back to the club where he found Mawtus on the . phone making a 999 call. Managers at Pine Ridge Golf Club in Surrey, pictured, sympathised with Samantha Mawtus when she said she was tied up during the raid at the club's bar . Simon Price, pictured left, who was dragged to a nearby wood and tied to a tree after the raid, today gave evidence at the trial of Samantha Mawtus, pictured right . The jury heard that the defendant claimed that she been grabbed from behind by a man and her hands and legs were bound. The defendant said she had spent 30 minutes freeing herself before calling the police. Mrs Merrick said that initially, the police assumed that Mawtus was a victim. But as their enquiries continued and her boyfriend was arrested, they became suspicious of her. A search of her Ford Fiesta, which . had been unusually parked in the customer car park and not in the staff . car park on the night of the raid, revealed a balaclava and a rubber . glove. Police also found a roll of gaffer tape of the type used to tie up Mr Price with Beatty’s finger-prints on it. Jurors heard that Mawtus had made a phone call to Laidlaw a few minutes before the robbery had been committed. The trial of Samantha Mawtus, 27, is taking place at Guildford Crown Court this week (file photo) ‘During the time when she said she was lying tied up and terrified on the ground, she was in communication with one of the robbers. ‘She was helping her boyfriend and his accomplice commit what was a very nasty and frightening incident for Mr Price,’ said Ms Merrick. Giving evidence, Mr Price told the court that on the evening that the raid happened, he had been expecting another member of staff to be working with him - not Mawtus. ‘She asked to go outside and have a cigarette in the designated no-smoking area,’ he said. ‘No more than five minutes elapsed before Miss Mawtus going out for a cigarette and the robber coming in.’ ‘He was waving a bat in front of me. I thought it was a joke and told him to stop messing around.’ But he said that the raider told him ‘I’m not messing around, give me the money.’ Mr Price said it was only later that he realised it was significant that the intruder had never inquired who else was in the bar at the time.

These CCTV images show the terrifying moment three young people, including a 17-year-old who was 16 weeks pregnant, were threatened in a city street by a teenager with a handgun. Alex Warren-Lean, now aged 19, approached a man and two girls in Plymouth to ask for a cigarette but when they refused he pulled a pistol from the pocket of his hoodie to threaten them a court heard. Plymouth Crown Court was told the terrified group told Warren-Lean one of his victims was pregnant and only then did he back away. Scroll down to watch video . Caught on camera: CCTV footage captured the moment Alex Warren-Lean threatened a group with a gun . Terrified: Warren-Lean only back away when one member of the group - a 17-year-old teenager - told him she was 16 weeks pregnant . The group then ran out of sight and called 999. Speaking after the hearing, the pregnant woman who didn’t want to be named, said she had been returning from a birthday party at a city centre social club when Warren-Lean approached them. She said: 'This bloke asked for a fag. We didn’t have any tobacco, and he started getting a bit funny. 'We carried on walking, but he started mouthing off at us. He pulled out a gun on us and I stepped back. 'He was holding it gangster-style and it looked like a real gun to me. Alex Warren-Lean, now 19, admitted possession of a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence . 'I was 16 weeks pregnant and I feared for my life and the lives of my unborn baby and the people around me.' She added that Warren-Lean did leave the group alone when she told him she was pregnant. Judge Francis Gilbert QC told Warren-Lean his pulling a pistol on a group of young people was 'plainly frightening, threatening and intended to be so'. Police believe the weapon was stolen along with replica guns, knives and samurai swords by Warren-Lean and an accomplice during a burglary of a dead man’s home in Plympton, Devon. Prosecutor Nick Lewin described how Warren-Lean and his friend Andrew Charlton, also 19, broke into a detached house in Plympton on April 24-25 last year. The owner had died four weeks earlier and his collection of weapons and Zippo lighters were still in the house awaiting probate. The pair stole two laptops, six lighters, four swords, 12-15 knives and daggers, three replica pistols and an air rifle, which was later found in the garden, the court heard. Both teenagers’ fingerprints were found at the scene. Police tried to track down the pair leading to two chases as the teenagers tried to escape. The first time the duo managed to escape on bikes and the second time involved a high-speed car chase as the boys tried to avoid capture in a van stolen from Warren-Lean’s father. It was described by an experienced traffic officer as 'one of the most appalling pieces of driving I have ever witnessed'. Warren-Lean was jailed for 35 months in a young offenders institution at Plymouth Combined Crown and Charlton was jailed for 15 months . Warren-Lean, just 17 at the time, had driven over kerbs, through red lights, ignored no-entry signs and pulled out of junctions into the path of oncoming vehicles. Co-defendant: Andrew Charlton admitted to a burglary carried out with Warren-Lean . They were chased by police for up to four miles before the being stopped by a Stinger, which punctured the tyres. Emma Birt, defending Warren-Lean, said he had been diagnosed with autism aged 12, taken into care and turned to drugs and alcohol, committing offences to fund his addiction. Julia Cox, defending Charlton, said his mother died when he was 15 and he began self-harming following the break-up of his relationship with his partner. Two knives from the break-in were later seized from Warren-Lean. The weapon used in the confrontation with the group was never found but Warren-Lean claimed it was just an unloaded BB gun belonging to Charlton. Warren-Lean admitted burglary, possession of a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence and asked for five other offences to be taken into consideration. Charlton admitted burglary and aggravated vehicle-taking. Judge Francis Gilbert QC sentenced Warren-Lean to 35 months in a young offenders’ institution. He sentenced Charlton to 15 months and banned him from driving for 12 months, telling him: 'The time has come when you have got to learn you can’t go on burgling other people’s property.' His pregnant victim added: 'I’m relieved he is getting time - he can’t hurt anyone else.' Now watch the video .","Alex Warren-Lean threatened group with a gun because they didn't have any tobacco .

But one foolhardy man walked into a bureau de chance in the Czech town of Rumburk and asked how much money in Czech korunas he would get for a 1,000 euro banknote. The cashier told him it was worth 24,000 korunas (943 euros / £740) and the exchange was made. Pushing his luck: A man managed to exchange this fake 1,000 euro banknote, complete with naked women and love hearts, at a bureau de change in the Czech Republic. There is no 1,000 euro banknote . Sounds straightforward, but the euro 'banknote' in question was covered in pictures of naked women and one of its  '€' logos spelled out '€ros', the Greek god of love. The stars on the EU flag had even been replaced by love hearts. As if that wasn't enough to convince the cashier of its somewhat dubious legal tender, there isn't even a 1,000 euro banknote anyway.

The two Taliban commanders who executed a helpless 22-year-old Afghan woman because 'they could not decide who could have her' have themselves been put to death, it has emerged. Footage posted online yesterday purported to show a burqa-clad woman being gunned down with an AK47 as baying villagers cheered in delight. The woman, named only as Najiba, was reportedly part of a Taliban love triangle - married to a member of the hardline militant group - and accused of adultery with a commander. A woman, named as 22-year-old Najiba is shown sitting at the edge of a ditch wearing a grey veil, in the right hand corner a man seem to be filming something out of frame . A man wearing white clothes and an orange beret appears pointing an AK47 rifle at her . The man opens fire at Najiba at point blank range as she is sitting with her back towards him . The horrific pictures, showing a crowd of bearded men gathering to watch a rifle-wielding gunman shoot her in the head and back - have sparked worldwide revulsion. Both British Foreign Secretary William Hague and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have condemned the killing in Qimchok village, in Afghanistan's Parwan province. Mr Hague said he was 'shocked and disgusted' by the reports of the execution and said: 'Such deplorable actions underline the vital need for better protection of the rights of women and girls in Afghanistan.' The Afghanistan Human Rights Commission also expressed outrage. The man continues to fire the AK47 rifle at Najiba's dead body as she lies at the place of execution on the outskirts of a village in the Parwan province, north of Kabul . A large crowd of bearded men in traditional clothing had gathered in the Qol village to watch the execution of the 22-year-old woman . Possibly satisfied with his work the executor walks away from her dead body after she was killed as a punishment for alleged adultery . Executive director Mohammad Musa Mahmodi said: 'We condemn any killings done without proper trial. It is un-Islamic and against any human rights values.' And Hillary Clinton, addressing a world conference on Afghanistan's future, said: 'The United States believes strongly that no nation can achieve peace, stability and economic growth if half the population is not empowered.' A 30-year-old woman and two of her children were beheaded in Afghanistan earlier this week as part of an honour-killing. The woman Serata's divorced husband is said to have barged into her house in the capital of Ghazni province and murdered her. He then killed their eight-year-old son and nine-year-old daughter because they had watched the attack. A pregnant Afghan woman was publicly executed by Taliban militants for alleged adultery in August 2010. Bibi Sanubar, 48, was flogged up to 200 times before being shot in the head and chest in the remote Qades district. Her alleged lover managed to escape. Abdul Jabbar Khan, security chief in the Taliban-controlled area, said the killing was ordered after the woman allegedly killed her newborn child to conceal illicit sex. The Taliban were accused last month of poisoning schoolgirls by bribing students and workers to sneak toxic chemicals into drinking water or spread it around school grounds. Six schools in northern Takhar province were affected - as they tried to stop females from going to school and gain an education. Afghan teenager Mumtaz, 18, was left scarred for life after the man she turned down in marriage attacked her with acid. One night several men showed up at their home and attacked her family. Finally two armed men held her, pulled her head back, and let the man who had wanted to marry her pour acid all over her face. Amateur footage of the brutal killing was posted online and . shows the woman, known only as Najiba, slump to the floor, as dozens of . men on a nearby hillside cheer, 'God is great!' The unidentified shooter, who is seen . wearing an orange pakol (the traditional Afghan hat), swiftly executes her - but continues to shoot . her dead body whilst walking towards it. Officials in Afghanistan said the killing came about due to a dispute between two Taliban members, who had argued over the woman. Parwan province governor Abdul Basir Salangi told CNN that as both Taliban men 'had some kind of relationship with the woman', they instead opted to accuse her of adultery to 'save face'. The harrowing images came from an . undated video, although it is thought the Afghanistan execution took . place some time in late June. The video was handed over by a Qol . villager to the Parwan provincial government, situated north of Kabul, . their spokeswoman Roshna Khalid told AFP today. It is understood that both Taliban commanders have subsequently been executed. The video has been condemned by the Afghan government as un-Islamic and inhuman. Public executions of alleged adulterers were common when the Taliban regime was in power. They were in control of the country from 1996 until 2001, when they were ousted by a US-led invasion for harbouring Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden after the 9/11 attacks. It came as Afghan suicide bombers today killed two children and wounded six others, when their explosive vests detonated prematurely as they went to attack police. The three bombers were on a motorcycle when their explosives went off in southern Kandahar city, killing and wounding children playing nearby, provincial spokesman Jawed Faisal said. Shortly afterwards a group of armed insurgents launched an attack on police headquarters in the volatile capital, the spiritual birthplace of the hardline Islamist Taliban. 'Probably the three bombers who blew up and killed children were going to join the attack,' Faisal said. The children were aged between eight and twelve and were playing at the time of the explosion. The attack on the police headquarters, some 2 miles away, began with an explosion and continued for around an hour after at least three insurgents took over a nearby school and fired on police. Six people, including two policemen, were wounded before all three attackers were killed, provincial police chief General Abdul Raziq said. 'Police handled the situation professionally. All three attackers were killed. Unfortunately six, including two police, were wounded,' he said.","Two commanders reportedly executed for their barbaric actions .

The mysterious vandals who have been stealing American flags from the tombstones of Civil War soldiers have been caught. But the unlikely culprits are much different from ordinary cemetery vandals. By setting up surveillance cameras throughout the historic Hudson, New York cemetery, police found that none other than woodchucks – the rodents that help predict the weather every February in Punxsutawney– were responsible for the grave’s defacing. Scroll down for video . Caught red-pawed: A surveillance camera set up by police caught this gopher red-handed stealing an American flag from Civil War soldier's graves . Possible outcomes: Before catching the 'vandals,' police thought teenagers could be to blame for the grave defacing . Homemaker: Woodchucks - also called groundhogs - often burrow in the ground and most likely used the flags for their nests (file photo) Police were suspicious when small American flags in the Grand Army of the Republic section of Cedar Park Cemetery began disappearing, thinking that teenagers using the cemetery as a hang-out could be to blame. Mayor Bill Hallenback told the Register-Star earlier this week that it is a relief to discover who – or what- was behind the defacing. He said that the miniature flags are . coated with a substance that the woodchucks find enticing, and found out . that other towns were having the same problem with rodents taking . flags. In total, 75 flags were reported missing, shocking locals who couldn’t believe someone would want to deface the graves of those killed in the line of duty. In one night alone, 17 flags disappeared from the soldiers’ graves. Authorities set up surveillance cameras to catch the culprits in the act. They were surprised to see that the groundhogs living within the cemetery were to blame. ‘I’m glad we don’t have someone who has taken it upon themselves to desecrate the stones and the flags in front of them,’ Mayor Hallenback said. The mayor added that scraps of the flags were found in the woodchuck’s burrows. Cemetery caretaker Vincent Wallace, who helped police in the search, told Hudson Valley’s YNN: ‘We were startled to find a woodchuck at the base of the tombstone with an empty flag pole in front of him.’ Sleuthing: A concerned citizen holds ruined flags while a Hudson police officer looks on; In total, 75 American flags disappeared . Patriotism: People first noticed the flags were disappearing preceding Fourth of July celebrations . The caretaker said that the evidence had always been against human vandals, pointing out that the flags were pulled downward rather than being ripped out. The flag thefts were discovered in the days leading up to Independence Day. As flags were put around the graves, they would again disappear, baffling and angering those involved. But police did not rule out a more sinister explanation. Police chief Ellis Richardson told KLTV that he had never seen anything like this in his 27 years of service, adding: ‘Typically, the assumption is juveniles or kids partying might be responsible for this type of incident.’ It is unclear what Cedar Park or the town plans to do with the cemetery’s living residents, though it is clear that . Chief . Richardson said there wasn’t much of a choice fighting the pests. ‘I’m . not sure how you can go up against Mother Nature, I think you’ll have to . start plugging up the holes,’ he suggested.

Laura Barker claims her career was ruined by her former chief-executive Steven Holliday . With her sunglasses perched on  her head and a bright smile for the camera, this is the glamorous executive at the centre of a sex row involving a married energy firm boss. Laura Barker, 32, was last night revealed as the woman who allegedly had her career ruined because she could not meet the ‘sexual demands’ of Steven Holliday. She worked for Mr Holliday as the vice- president of marketing at the US wing of National Grid, where he is chief executive. Her parents claim the 55-year-old pursued her for sex and then sabotaged her career when she began to reject his advances. Now, after quitting her lucrative job at the energy company, they say she is unemployed and fears she will never find work again. Last night, her father Keith spoke out to tell the Daily Mail that Mr Holliday, who is also a non-executive director of Marks & Spencer, had ruined his daughter’s future. He said: ‘Mr Holliday is trying to save his career. But he’s got no respect. She was a high-flier. She worked in Boston and New York. She’s not working now and she can’t get a position. She has no career, no future. ‘I’ve seen through the last two years what she has gone through trying to resurrect her career. ‘And all the way through there have been problems with the company Mr Holliday is head of.’ Mr Barker, 63, said he and his estranged wife Brigid decided to confront Mr Holliday ‘of their own volition’ and are still discussing the incident with their daughter. Mrs Barker interrupted the M&S annual general meeting at London’s Royal Festival Hall on Tuesday to accuse Mr Holliday of ‘breaching his own code of ethics’ in front of 2,000 stunned shareholders. Allegations: Steven Holliday has not made any comments in regards to being accused of making sexual advances on Miss Barker and then 'ruined her career' when she could not meet them . The pair were escorted out after Mrs Barker claimed he had pursued their daughter and then ‘destroyed her career when she could no longer meet his sexual demands’. She did not state her name when she made the allegations, but was happy to reveal her identity after the meeting. Mr Barker added: ‘We wouldn’t have stood up and said what we said if we didn’t feel strongly. We can see how it’s devastated her.’ Miss Barker spent eight years at National Grid, three of which were in Boston, as director and then vice-president of marketing. She began her career at ExxonMobil, where Mr Holliday also spent 19 years – although they did not work together there. From yesterday's Daily Mail . When she left National Grid in 2010, she was appointed as marketing director at Imperial College London, but left six months ago and has not worked since. It is understood she recently applied for another high-level position but was rejected. She lives in London with her mother while her father, an engineer, still lives at the family’s £270,000 four-bedroom detached house in Solihull, West Midlands. National Grid has said it launched an investigation into the allegations in 2010 but they were found to be ‘without foundation’. Mr Holliday declined to comment.","Laura Barker, 32, claims she is unable to find employment since leaving energy firm National Grid .

Spared: Shirley Garman has avoided prison after she left her 18-year-old disabled daughter at home while she went out drinking . This the mother who left her vulnerable, disabled daughter home alone while she went to a pub and got drunk. Shirley Garman's daughter Jahdine was found by police distressed and was so agitated she kept falling over and had to be taken to hospital for treatment. Guildford Crown Court heard officers became concerned about Jahdine after they were called to a disturbance at a pub in upmarket Oxshott, Surrey, which Garman was involved in, and wondered who was looking after her daughter. They visited the house in Epsom, Surrey, and found Jahdine in a distressed state and agitated about an alarm on the cooker. When Garman returned home, four hours later, she failed to recognise that the officers at her house were the same ones who had spoken to her at the pub. Today, a judge decided not to send 40-year-old . Garman prison after she admitted neglect so that she could receive . treatment for her alcohol problems. Prosecutor Jonathan Davies told the court the defendant had been the sole carer for her daughter, who despite being 18 years old, appeared and acted much younger. 'Jahdine was someone who had the appearance of a nine or 10-year-old girl and has a disorder present from birth - Russell Silver syndrome - which means she has poor growth, is shorter in height, has differences on the two sides of her body. 'She has epilepsy, encephalitis, and learning difficulties. 'She needed full-time care and should not be left alone for anything but a short time.' He said police were called to the disturbance on May 6 last year and that the defendant was involved. He said: 'The police officers who attended considered she had been drinking and she was displaying signs of that. They knew about Jahdine and were concerned if Shirley Garman was in the pub, where was Jahdine? 'They went to the home. Jahdine came to the door. She was agitated by an alarm in the flat - on the cooker. She said she didn’t know what to do about it. 'She repeatedly fell to the floor. She said she hadn’t eaten that day.' Abandoned: The girl was left on her own at the house in Epsom, Surrey, while Shirley Garman went out drinking . While her daughter suffered back home, Garman was drinking at a pub in the upmarket village of Oxshott . The officers called for an ambulance and Jahdine was taken to hospital, before being cared for away from her mother. The teenager was found to have lost a lot of weight. 'A social worker said both the defendant and Jahdine appeared to have been in a state of decline,' said Mr Davies. He added that on the day in question, Garman had requested a social worker to care for Jahdine while she went shopping. Yet social services told her they had an understanding that her daughter could be left on her own for short periods of time. 'What in fact happened was Jahdine was left for a period of up to four hours,' said the prosecutor. 'She denied any neglect of her daughter. She said she didn’t want to be out for too long but she saw her friend outside the pub, spoke to him, and there was an argument.' Shirley Garman's daughter Jahdine suffers from a rare disorder known as Russell Silver syndrome. The disorder is a form of dwarfism which occurs in one in every 50,000 to 100,000 births. The syndrome causes stunted growth, meaning sufferers are shorter than average and different sides of the body grow at different rates. Those with the disorder can also have problems eating and processing food properly, meaning they end up with dangerously low levels of muscle or body fat. Jahdine also suffered from epilepsy, which results in seizures, and encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain which can cause hallucinations and convulsions. On November 11 last year, while on bail for the neglect, Garman was arrested again, for trying to steal a student’s phone. She had been begging at Oxshott railway station with a man, again while drunk. She asked to use a phone belonging to a Miss Al-Fekaiki, but when she refused, Garman grabbed for it. A nearby worker intervened and the victim made her escape, later reporting the matter to police. She was with officers looking for the man when she saw Garman going into a shop and pointed her out. Garman said she had left her handbag on a train and needed to make a phone call and denied either begging or trying to steal the phone. Judge Peter Moss later told her: 'I do not, for a second, accept your explanation'. Speaking in mitigation for Garman, James Bloomer urged the judge not to jail his client as that would prevent her from receiving help in addressing her alcohol problem. He also said that while the four-hour period was frightening for Jahdine, it should be seen in the context of alcoholism after years of appropriate care. 'There is a difference between a deterioration and turning to alcohol after 18 years worth of glowing, appropriate care for someone in a difficult situation,' he said. The force used in the attempted phone theft was in a bid to get the phone and was not directed towards the victim, he added. The court also heard that Garman had requested social workers to look after her daughter while she went shopping . Garman admitted neglect at Guildford Crown Court today and was told to deal with her alcohol problems . Judge Moss told Garman: 'I don’t think you were entirely truthful and I don’t think you have been entirely truthful since. 'I think you went to meet someone for a drink. You had a drink, and another drink. 'There was a disturbance and police were called and you were too drunk to realise the police knew you and Jahdine. 'You went round, turned up at your own house and didn’t recognise the same police officers.' He acknowledged Garman had shown herself to be a loving, caring mother and he said he did not understand the reasons behind her turning to alcohol. 'The prosecution thought long and hard as to whether it was in the public interest to prosecute you at all. They did, and rightly so.' He added: 'You are on a slippery slope and I think you have got a real problem with drink and temperament.' He ordered Garman to be placed under a community order for two-and-a-half years, with an alcohol treatment requirement, and that she carry out 100 hours of unpaid work. He also told her to pay Miss Al-Fekaiki £100 pounds in compensation.","Police went to visit Shirley Garman's daughter after disturbance in pub .

Fans, who queued overnight for . tickets to see the 25-year-old in action . cheered and waved their Union Jack flags all the way through the night as officials allowed play to carry on just after the scheduled closure. Council regulations prohibit matches to continue after 11pm but with the win in Murray's grasp the game concluded in the nick of time. In a bizarre twist to the tie Murray was at risk of throwing the match away as he dropped a handful of points after balls, kept in his pocket on his service games, fell out during play. A knee injury also seemed to be threatening his push for a fourth round berth, which he had strapped up, but he finally claimed the win. As the last Briton left in the competition, Murray - once again - carries the hopes of the nation on his shoulders. Outside the packed court thousands of fans have even flocked to 'Henman Hill' inside the All Lawn Tennis Club to watch the Scot on the big screen. Prior to the tie bookmakers slashed the odds on him winning Wimbledon from 10/1 to 11/2, in the wake of Rafael Nadal's elimination on Friday. And the Scot has extra incentive to beat the world number 24, who knocked him out of the fourth round back in 2006 - the Cypriot is coached by his former trainer Miles Maclagan. Maclagan, who worked with Murray between 2007 and 2010, has been coaching Baghdatis since last summer. And . he believes his former boss will be feeling the pressure of Rafael . Nadal's elimination - which makes Murray favourite to reach the final. Of the Nadal result, he said: 'It affects Andy a lot. His job will be to stay thinking about the next match.

He received another boost yesterday when potential opponent Milos Raonic was beaten by America's Sam Querrey. The British number one revealed he avoids watching replays of his games, and also tries to steer clear of lucky routines, although he does avoid wearing new socks. Writing on a BBC blog, he said he puts on a new shirt and shorts for each match - players are given around 15 at the start of a grand slam - but added: 'one thing I never wear is new socks. They can be a little slippery'. Fans were queuing yesterday morning - more than 24 hours before the match - to get tickets. Sarah Johnson, 27, and fiance Graham Johnson, 26, left their home in Mile End, east London, early to set up camp. 'I've been before but Graham never has, I'm pretty sure we'll get Centre Court tickets,' she said. 'Although I'm a big Murray fan I've never seen him play live.

After an interrupted Friday, forecasters warned the rain could return today to wreak havoc on the schedule. But the showers stayed away and by the time play started on Centre and Number 1 courts Wimbledon was basking in sunshine. Despite the weather, Wimbledon faced another thriller last night when six-time champion Roger Federer found himself two points away from being knocked out, but fought back to beat Julien Benneteau. Heather Watson, who lost her place in the grand slam to world number three Agnieszka Radwanska, again praised the crowd for their support. The 20-year-old, from Guernsey, who broke down in tears after she was knocked out last year, said: 'I held it till I got off the court, and then was just a bit, you know, let it all out.' Of the crowd, she said: 'They were absolutely amazing throughout the whole match. 'I just want to do well for them and keep coming back and playing for my country.' Asked what she will do with her £38,875 prize money, Watson said: 'I think I'll deserve a little present for myself', and said she also plans to take her team-mates out for a 'nice dinner'. But the 20-year-old, who previously said she was eating smoked salmon and eggs every morning, added: 'I've had enough salmon this week. I'm done with the salmon.'

A sex offender has been banned from having one-night stands because of his violent history towards women. A judge said Richard Ford, 41, must refuse any 'offers on a plate' as unsuspecting women would not be aware of his background. He was told to contact his probation officer if he wanted to start a relationship. The restrictions were put in place when Ford appeared at St Albans Crown Court this week to admit to failing to notify police of a change of address after being placed on the sex offenders' register. Judge John Plumstead  said the situation was exasperated by Ford, from New Road, Croxley Green, Rickmansworth, also breaking a restraining order. He said: 'He has a history of violence towards women and children and has possessed images of sadism and torture. He is an extremely concerning man. 'He is not allowed to take advantage of a one-night stand offered on a plate by someone who doesn't know his background. 'He is not allowed to form relationships until probation know who with.

He was sentenced to a 36-month community order and placed on supervision for 36 months and told he must attend the Thames Valley Sex Offenders Programme as directed by the probation service. He was also made the subject of a sexual offences prevention order and his name was put on the sex offenders register for an indefinite period. As a result, Ford was required to notify the police if he changed his address and it was his failure to do that landed him in trouble and back in court.

Tax inspectors were last night accused of ‘turning a blind eye’ to controversial payroll practices at the BBC . MPs on all sides called for a crackdown following revelations that thousands of the broadcaster’s staff – including dozens of well-known presenters – are employed through personal service companies. The arrangement allows them to minimise their tax bills and potentially saves the BBC millions in national insurance contributions. Crackdown: Thousands of BBC staff, including several high-profile presenters, are employed through personal service companies . But MPs said it was immoral for a publicly funded organisation to encourage practices designed to minimise tax. Tory David Mowat, whose freedom of information request revealed that more than 3,000 BBC staff were paid in this way, said a Government crackdown on similar arrangements in the public sector should be extended to the corporation. MPs heard this week that 148 of the BBC’s 467 presenters were paid ‘off the books’. The list is thought to include Jeremy Paxman and Fiona Bruce. Mr Mowat said: ‘The BBC is our national broadcaster and, as such, should be particularly diligent in not pushing the boundaries on this sort of thing. We have to assume that these arrangements are legal, but they are certainly not acceptable.’ HM Revenue and Customs was facing questions after figures revealed it had all but abandoned enforcement of laws designed to prevent the misuse of personal service companies. High-profile presenter: Fiona Bruce is thought to be one of the 148 BBC stars paid 'off the books' graphic page 10.jpg . Last year tax inspectors launched 23 investigations into breaches of the rules, down from more than 1,000 a year a decade ago. Reacting to the furore, HMRC last night said it planned a tenfold increase in enforcement of laws governing ‘disguised employment’ in the coming year. But Margaret Hodge, Labour chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, said the figures suggested a ‘worrying lack of vigilance’. Stephen Barclay, a Tory member of the committee, said HMRC appeared to have been ‘turning a blind eye’. He also questioned why the BBC was refusing to name the stars involved. ‘It is quite remarkable that people who are the face of the BBC, and who have been working there for years, are not employed by the corporation,’ he said. ‘If it is all legitimate, as we are told it is, then why all the secrecy? Why are people embarrassed about it if it is the right thing to do?’ The row follows an explosive hearing at the public accounts committee on Monday when the BBC’s finance chief Zarin Patel was grilled by MPs over the corporation’s employment practices. Miss Patel insisted the arrangements were standard industry practice. But Mrs Hodge said a whistleblower had told the committee that the BBC was now forcing some freelance staff to set up personal service companies, telling them they were unlikely to be investigated by HMRC, a suggestion rejected by Miss Patel. Yesterday the BBC said it was ‘satisfied’ its payment arrangements were ‘appropriate and in line with HMRC guidelines’, adding: ‘However, in view of the select committee’s interest in this area, we will undertake a review of the detail of these arrangements and report back to the committee.’","List of 148 stars who are paid 'off the books' thought to include Fiona Bruce and Jeremy Paxman .

Amazingly the IT worker had already driven seven miles from his home in the nearby village of Witham St Hughs before the collision. Dickens was caught on camera as he weaved through Lincoln city centre at 3am in his Seat Ibiza - leaving sparks flying from the road. Lincoln Crown Court heard Dickens was eventually arrested by a shocked police officer after staggering from his car and setting off on foot towards the city's railway station.

'The front offside wheel was missing. There was a wheel on his front passenger seat and it would appear that a member of the public had stopped him and given him back the wheel.' Dickens failed a breathalyser test producing a reading of 55 mgs of alcohol per 100 mls of breath putting him over the legal limit of 35 mgs. Mr Scott added: 'He said he could not remember anything. 'He came home had his dinner and drank a bottle of wine. He went to bed at 11 pm and the next thing he remembers is being taken by the police to hospital in an ambulance.' Chris Jeyes, mitigating, said Dickens has since undergone medical tests. Confused: Dickens said he came home had his dinner and drank a bottle of wine.

To make light of the rain, Sarah and Mark Camilletti, posed for their photographs armed with umbrellas, wellington boots and towels to make the most of their big day at the waterlogged Hotel Felix in Cambridge. The bride, 29, and groom, 34, had dreamed of taking their vows among the hotel’s idyllic gardens but were forced to make their lifelong commitments indoors. Not a dampener: Determined to pose in the garden they dreamt of, bride and groom Sarah and Mark Camilletti put on wellies for their wedding photos . Wet wedding party: Armed with wellies and umbrellas the family and bridal party braved the two foot floods at Hotel Felix in Cambridge . Not letting the deluge dampen their spirit, the bride and groom still headed for the gardens to take their wedding photographs, donning wellies to pose for the camera. The couple said they were always prepared for the great British weather but didn’t expect to have their wedding in the middle of a lake. Picturesque punting: Hotel manager Shara Ross said the garden was 'only good for punting' after the heavy rains . Getting hitched: Mrs Camilletti had to hitch up her wedding dress to get to the chairs but her gallant groom carried her back through the knee-high water . Mrs Camilletti said her dreams of a sunlit outdoor ceremony were shattered, but added she ‘could not have imagined anything better’. She said: ‘We knew it was going to be wet in the run up to it so we brought a whole load of wellies and umbrellas and asked the guests to do the same. ‘It was quite funny when they were arriving in the morning and some of the guests thought there was a lovely lake in the garden. ‘But when they saw the tables and chairs poking out of the middle they realised it wasn’t a lake and that was where we were supposed to have the wedding. The water was knee deep.’ Never wetter: While the couple had hoped for a sunny ceremony, it turned out to be 'better than imagined' Mrs Camilletti had to hitch up her white dress to wade through the knee deep floodwater to climb onto a romantic bench. Mr Camilletti braved the two feet floods, with the tails of his morning suit dangling just feet above the murky water. They were joined by family members, the best man and bridesmaids, who had all been ordered to bring their wellies so the memorable photoshoot could still go ahead. The groom and one of his friends gallantly carried the giggling bride back to dry land after the muddy memories had been captured. A duck's day: Making light of the floods, the couple floated rubber ducks complete with wedding attire . Mrs Camilletti, a family support worker at a children’s centre and civil servant at the Ministry of Justice Mark from north London, said the flooding made the occasion. She said: ‘We could not have imagined anything better.’ They shared their wet wedding day with 100 guests and are now on their honeymoon in Norfolk where they hope the sun will shine. Shara Ross, general manager of Hotel Felix, said the garden was ‘only good for punting’ after recent heavy rains. Usually sunshine: Hotel Felix in Cambridge is usually an idyllic location perfect for a wedding . She praised the Camillettis for ‘taking it all in their stride’ when many couples would have ‘completely lost it’. On the day elsewhere in Cambridge, families battled to save their possessions as floodwater seeped into homes in Girton. There are currently two flood alerts in place for east England, 21 alerts in other regions and one flood warning in Wales. The flooding came after last month was the wettest June in the UK since records began in 1910, provisional figures from the Met Office showed.

Just hours later a friend pointed out the outline of the Iron Lady floating over the top of the baby’s body. The couple, from Stanhope, Kent, said the image looks 'just like Maggie’s character from spitting image'. Bizarrely, they also claim they can make out the faces of Maggie’s former rivals, Labour leader Neil Kinnock and ex-Lib Dem leader David Steel. The images all appear in a line in the shadows cast by the ultrasound above the baby, with the outline of Baroness Thatcher in the middle. Father of six Mr Smith said: 'It is such a strange thing too see. We had not noticed it at first we were too busy looking at the baby. 'But we put it on Facebook over the weekend and someone just spotted that it looked a bit like Maggie Thatcher. 'Its amazing how much it looks like her.

The Government today gave the green-light to its first controversial new toll road since David Cameron announced his radical  pay-as-you-drive policy in Spring. But it sparked an immediate row as motoring groups said it marked a U-turn by allowing tolling on existing roads – not just on those which were new or enhanced. Drivers will have to pay to use a 20-mile section of the main A14 through Cambridgeshire which will form part of a major investment in highways in eastern England. Controversial: A 20-mile stretch of the A14 in Cambridgeshire, pictured, is to become a toll road, David Cameron has announced . Although no charges have yet been set, drivers could expect to pay between £3 and £5 for the privilege. It is the first tolling announcement since Prime Minister Cameron revealed in March a 'radical' plan to kick-start the economy by allowing private firms and investment fund companies to compete to build, operate and maintain the major motorways and trunk roads in England and Wales, noting: 'There's nothing green about a traffic jam - and gridlock holds the economy back.' He said radical solutions were needed to unblock Britain's gridlocked roads  at a time  when 'frankly, there isn't enough money'. He added: 'Road tolling is one option - but we are only considering this for new, not existing, capacity.' Motorists would not pay tolls to use existing roads, he insisted at the time. However, experts say today's announcement suggests a significant policy shift as the Transport Department said entire stretches of existing roads which are 'enhanced' can now be tolled – not just the extra lanes which are added, often dubbed 'Lexus lanes'. Supporter: David Cameron has said: 'There's nothing green about a traffic jam - and gridlock holds the economy back' Transport Secretary Justine Greening said the tolling was an 'imaginative solution' to beating congestion. Critics say it is privatisation by the back door. The A14 corridor scheme in Cambridgeshire has been added to the Department for Transport's major projects programme and work could start by 2018. Funding for the improvements could be generated in part through tolling a length of the enhanced A14, featuring 20 miles of new or widened road. But more work would be done 'to determine the best tolling solution, including what length the tolled section should be, how users would pay and what the tariff should be'. Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation and a supporter said: 'Today's announcement is significant. 'Ministers have gone further than before by opening the possibility for tolling existing roads and not just brand new capacity - in this case a widened section of the A14, a critical international trade route. 'Faced with the necessity to generate new funds for infrastructure this news demonstrates that Government is being innovative in its thinking. 'We would hope that work on enhancing the A14 starts sooner rather than later and certainly before 2018.' He added: 'Under this plan parts of the A14 will be enhanced, widened and tolled in their entirety. This is new and goes further than was mentioned previously.' Edmund King, the AA's president, condemned the change. He said: 'The worry is that essential traffic will divert off the toll route and clog up local routes leading to more congestion, pollution and accidents.' The Department for Transport said: 'Two new roads would be built in parallel to, with one on each side of, the current A14 immediately north of Cambridge for local use. 'Meanwhile, the existing A14 carriageway will be upgraded through the removal of accesses and junctions, and improvements to junctions at the northern and southern ends. ' The Department added: 'Study work has . confirmed that funding for these can be generated in part through . tolling a length of the enhanced A14, featuring around 20 miles of new . or widened road. 'However, . more work will be taken to determine the best tolling solution, . including what length the tolled section should be, how users would pay . and what the tariff should be.' Plan: The A14 corridor scheme in Cambridgeshire has been added to the Department for Transport's major projects programme and work could start by 2018 . Transport Secretary Justine Greening said: 'The A14 is a crucial strategic route for the east of England, vital not only for international road traffic using the port of Felixstowe but everyone who relies on it daily. 'This is why my department has been working hard to generate innovative and imaginative solutions to tackling long term congestion.' Labour said the tolls on existing . parts of the A14 was a significant policy u-turn and could open the way . for 'a tolling free for all' on the nation's roads. John Woodcock MP, Labour's Shadow . Transport Minister, said: 'Tolling existing roads is another broken . promise to motorists who are being squeezed like never before by this . out of touch Government. Ministers need to spell out how many road users . will be caught by the new tolls they are set to impose on existing . roads.' The AA said it welcomed the decision to improve capacity in the area but felt that 20 miles of tolls could backfire as a road to nowhere for Britain's 35 million drivers. An AA/Populus poll in 2011 found that 58 per cent opposed the tolling of new roads (39per cent were strongly opposed). While improved local roads alongside the A14 would be welcome they would risk becoming clogged with drivers diverting to avoid the tolls, the AA said.","Proposal to introduce tolling on A14 in Cambridgeshire .

A convicted paedophile linked to the unsolved murders of four children in the 1970s after a breakthrough in DNA technology has a startling history of sex abuse, court records show. Arch Edward Sloan, who is serving a life sentence for raping a 10-year-old boy in 1983, has been named in the case of the Oakland County Child Killer, who went on the rampage for 13 months. Investigators reopened the case into the murders of two girls and the rape and murders of two boys in 2005 and found strands of hair on two of the victims matched a strand found in Sloan's car. The man, now 70, has refused to cooperate with investigators, but court documents reveal his frightening history of sexual abuse and how his family feared he had an incurable problem. Sex offender: Arch Edward Sloan is serving a life sentence for raping a 10-year-old boy in 1983. DNA on hair found in his truck has also linked him to four killings in the 1970s . A psychiatrist who evaluated him in the 1980s to determine his competency for trial noted: 'Defendant was only capable of sexual satisfaction with small children,' the Detroit Free Press reported. Another added: 'Defendant's mental illness made him unable to control his impulses and made him unable to conform his conduct to what he knew was wrong, what he knew was legally required.' Sloan grew up in Southfield, Michigan and completed his GED while serving a two-and-a-half year sentence for gross indecency between males. He was paroled in 1961. Between 1970 and the early 1980s, he was found guilty in three other sex assault cases, including charges of sodomy and corrupting the morals of a minor. Victims: The first victims of the Oakland County Child Killer were Mark Stebbins, 12, who was killed after walking home in January 1976. Jill Robinson, 12, was killed in December 1976 . Unsolved: Kristine Mihelich, 10, vanished in January 1977 and was found 19 days later in a ditch. Timothy King, 11, disappeared in March and was also found in a ditch. King and Stebbins were both raped . He was sentenced to life behind bars after a grisly crime on October, 1983 in Detroit, when the 10-year-old son of a co-worker stayed with him so they could go fishing the next day. Sloan bet the boy he could beat him in a race; if the boy won, he would win a dollar, but if he lost, he had to perform a sex act on Sloan, according to court records. The boy lost and was assaulted. Later the same night, Sloan gave the child soda and wine and when they went to bed, Sloan made the boy strip and then he raped him, records show. The next day, he dropped the boy off at a gas station with $5 and told him not to tell anyone what had happened, the Free Press reported. Sloan's lawyer failed to get him declared mentally incompetent for trial and he was convicted. Before his trial, his mother Caroline Sloan wrote to the judge, asking: 'I know what Arch did was wrong, but Your Honor, will locking him up in a jail help his problem?' Search: Police launched a search for the killer and released the drawing and posters in 1977. Sloan worked in the area as a mechanic and agreed to have his car searched, from which police took hairs . Sloan was an early suspect in the murders and rapes of Mark Stebbins and Timothy King and the murders of Kristine Mihelich and Jill Robinson, and allowed officers to search his 1966 Pontiac. There they found a hair, which was . stored. Forensic specialists have found the DNA of the hair matched that . of the hairs found on the victims - but did not match Sloan's. Arch Edward Sloan, who has been linked to the Oakland County Killings in Michigan in the 1970s after a break through in DNA technology, has a frightening criminal past. 1959: Charged with gross indecency in Detroit.

Source: Detroit Free Press . Officers are now trying to determine what role, if any, he played in the murders. He had two other vehicles and investigators have suggested he might have loaned the car to a friend. Mark, 12, the child killer's first victim, disappeared February 15, 1976, on his way home from an American Legion hall. His body was found four days later in a shopping centre car park in Southfield. Timothy, the child killer's last known victim, disappeared March 16, 1977, after leaving a drugstore, where he had gone to buy sweets. His body was found six days later in a ditch in Livonia. Investigators found a single strand of human hair on Mark's clothing. That hair matched the DNA profile of two hairs found in Timothy's underpants and in his nasal cavity. The person behind the killings is believed to have killed at least two other children. Jill Robinson, 12, of Royal Oak, . disappeared after leaving home following an argument with her mother on . December 22, 1976, and was found four days later on the side of a road. Kristine Mihelich, 10, of Berkley, vanished after buying a magazine at a 7-Eleven store on January 2, 1977. She was found 19 days after she disappeared in a ditch in Franklin. Jill died of a shotgun blast to the head; the other children were suffocated. Their killings were linked due to their proximity and white animal hair found on all four victims. The killings horrified Detroit . parents. At the time, residents phoned in thousands of tips to a hastily . mobilised, 200-member task force led by the State Police. Suspect: Christopher Busch was named by another suspect as the killer. He pleaded guilty to other abuse and killed himself in 1978. Officers found the picture, right, in his room and agreed it looked like Stebbins . Match: James Gunnels, 47, was an alleged abuse victim of Busch and police believe he may have assisted him in the killings. His mitrochondrial DNA matches a hair found on Kristine . Investigators . eventually released a composite sketch of a man who was seen standing . near Timothy and a blue American Motors Corp. Gremlin before King . disappeared. Police questioned and polygraphed many suspects, but never made an arrest. The task force shut down in December 1978 after exhausting its $2 million budget. One suspect was sex offender Christopher Busch, who was named by another suspect as the killer. When he committed suicide in 1978, police found a drawing on his wall that looked like Stebbins. In March 2009, the FBI found that that mitochondrial DNA from James Gunnels, a 47-year-old . parolee, matched the DNA from a hair fragment found on Kristine's body.

'Honeytrap': British professor Paul Frampton has landed up in jail after he was allegedly caught with drugs trying to board a plane in South America . A distinguished British scientist languishing in an Argentine jail on suspicion of drug smuggling has spoken for the first time about his ordeal. Oxford University graduate Paul Frampton has been held in prison since January after being stopped at an airport in Buenos Aires as he tried to board a plane to Peru with two kilos of cocaine in his suitcase. He claimed afterwards he was the victim of a honey-trap sting involving an internet model. Last night he named the beauty - a 32-year-old Czech-born glamour model now based in the U.S - for the first time as he spoke about his fears he may die in jail if convicted. Mr Frampton said he thought he was swapping messages on a dating site with stunning Denise Milani - but now believes members of a South American mafia tricked him into carrying a suitcase carrying drugs by posing as the underwear model. There is no suggestion the model had any . involvement in the drugs smuggling plot - or knew a mafia was allegedly . using her identity for honey-trap stings. Last night influential friends in the scientific community continued to fight for his release on bail as he faced the prospect of a 16-year-jail sentence, if convicted. Extraordinary details of the events leading up to his arrest emerged - including a 10 day stay in Bolivia waiting for Miss Milani to join him for the start of a new life together before his fateful trip to Argentina. Worcestershire-born Mr Frampton, 68, awarded a BA degree with Double First Class Honours at Oxford, said: 'Perhaps I should have realised earlier but the fraudster was very good and very intelligent. 'I never thought these sorts of people existed. For 11 weeks I thought I was chatting with an attractive woman.' Divorced Mr Frampton was arrested on January 23 at Ezieza International Airport, moments before he boarded a plane to Peru for a second flight to the U.S where he is now teaches. The drugs were found wrapped in gift paper inside the lining of the suitcase. Mr Frampton claims he was given the . suitcase at a hotel in Buenos Aires by a Hispanic-looking middle-aged . man who told him it belonged to the model. The . scientist flew to Argentina after a 10-day stay in Bolivia where he . thought he was going to meet Miss Milani, born Denise Trlica and best . known for her natural 32DD chest which helped her become 2007 'Miss . Bikini World' and a favourite with readers of mens' magazines Maxim and . FHM. Czech-born Denise Milani has somehow been involved in the case of Paul Frampton. There is nothing to suggest the lingerie model knew that her identity was being used . Mr Frampton said he believed he was in contact with Miss Milani and said he believed they were internet lovers . He told an Argentine newspaper he planned to take the suitcase to Brussels in Belgium for a new meeting with his internet girlfriend. However, he was persuaded by a friend to book a flight back to his home in America and forget Miss Milani. Investigators are said to have carried out psychological tests on Mr Frampton to rule out mental illness. Poorly: A more recent picture of Mr Frampton. His friends are said to be concerned for his health and have written to various authorities to try and get him freed . Mr Frampton, who is suffering from lung problems following his enforced stay in prison, admitted last night he may be suffering from a mental disorder brought on by his obsession with psychics. The scientist's ex-wife has described him as being very 'naive' emotionally. He told respected Argentine newspaper Clarin from his prison cell: 'The person I thought was this woman told me she liked older men and was tired of doing photo sessions. 'I fell for the story. Before my arrest on January 23 I was convinced I was chatting with a ""her"" and after a couple of weeks in prison, I realised it was a man, a criminal posing as this model. '""She"" asked me if I could be proud of someone like ""her"". It was quite convincing. 'I found out I wasn't going to meet her in Bolivia as planned the day I got there. 'I should have returned to the States right then. But I always complete my plans, the same way I complete my physics papers. She was my project.' He added: 'It didn't seem strange to me at the time that this person invited me to meet up with her in Bolivia. 'The idea was to go there and return with her a couple of days later to the place where I live.' Mr Frampton, who studied at Brasenose College, one of the constituent colleges of the University of Oxford, is being held at Villa Devoto Prison in Buenos Aires. The jail was the scene of some of the worst prison riots in Argentine history in 1978 which left 62 people dead. Leading academics including 1979 Physics Nobel Prize winner Sheldon Glashow - who Mr Frampton has written more than a dozen scientific articles with - have written to the investigating judge in charge of his case to plead his innocence. Several have also written a letter to Argentine president Cristina Kirchner asking her to intervene. Mr Frampton, from Kidderminster in Worcestershire, was teaching at the University of North Carolina when he was arrested and his pay was suspended. Professor Frampton, who was born in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, now lives in the United States and teaches physics at the University of North Carolina, pictured . His case mirrors that of New Zealander Sharon Mae Armstrong, who was arrested at Ezeiza International Airport in April last year after five kilos of cocaine were found in her suitcase shortly before she boarded a flight to Spain. She was convicted and sentenced to four years and ten months in prison in February this year. Judges convicted her despite accepting her claim she had been set up by a man she met on the internet. The civil servant arranged to fly to London to meet him after months of online exchanges - but at the last minute flights he had bought her were changed to go via Argentina so she could pick up paperwork he had requested. She ended up agreeing to take a suitcase to Britain for him with the cocaine hidden inside - and was arrested in April last year before she boarded a British Airways flight. Her mystery lover and alleged accomplices have never been found. Miss Armstrong's defence lawyer produced evidence at her trial of south American mafias specialising in honey-trap stings like the one she got caught up in.","Professor was stopped at an airport in Buenos Aires as he tried to board a plane .

Wellington College housemaster Bruce Roth, pictured arriving at Reading Crown Court, where he was convicted of all 17 sex abuse charges . A housemaster at one of Britain’s most prestigious public schools was jailed for 11 years today after being found guilty of sexually assaulting five young boys during a ‘20-year campaign of abuse’. Predatory paedophile Bruce Roth, 46, would sneak into the dormitory of £30,000-a-year Wellington College to molest his victims as they slept. He was also convicted of assaulting two eight-year-old boys at £26,000-a-year King’s School, in Kent, where he worked before his recent post at the Berkshire boarding school. Throughout the trial, the court heard that ‘highly manipulative’ maths teacher Roth had performed sex acts on some of the boys and had encouraged one child to do the same to him. He was initially investigated and suspended at Rochester’s King’s School, where he worked between 1987 and 1994, after relatives of the two pupils reported him to staff. But following an internal inquiry, Roth, a former singer with 80s pop band The Housemartins, was exonerated after a teacher decided it was his word against that of a pupil. His reign of abuse did not end until one of his victims phoned children’s charity ChildLine and he was finally arrested in October 2010. Roth vehemently denied the charges . against him - accusing his victims of conspiring against him because . they did not like him as a teacher. He even went as far as to brand one of them a ‘fantasist’ with a ‘sinister’ side. But today, he was convicted of 17 counts of sexual offences against children after month-long week trial at Reading Crown Court. The £30,000-a-year Wellington College in Berkshire, where Roth abused his victims as they slept . Roth was also convicted of assaulting two eight-year-old boys at £26,000-a-year King's School, in Kent . Ruth was sentenced to 11 years in jail for his 20 years of abuse against male students . As the jury returned their verdicts, Roth, who was dressed in a smart grey suit and tie, stood in the dock and shook his head in disbelief. As the foreman read the guilty counts, a woman was heard sobbing in the public gallery. Prosecutor . Daniel Fugallo said: ‘Over a period of 20 years, from the late 1980s . through to 2009, he has abused his position of trust as a teacher by . touching five boys in his care for his own sexual gratification. ‘These boys were at the time these offences took place, say the prosecution, between eight and 15 years old. ‘They are now all young men in their late 20s and 30s.’ Earlier in the trial the jury had . visited Wellington College, whose master is Tony Blair’s biographer . Anthony Seldon, to be shown the corridors and dorms where pupils alleged . they were abused. After the sentencing, Mr Seldon said he was ‘sickened and appalled by his employee’s vile crimes.’ He . added: 'The whole staff at Wellington, who work tirelessly to nurture and protect the pupils at the college, are angered and saddened that a staff member could have committed these vile crimes.'This abuse represents a terrible betrayal of trust - that Roth could have preyed on vulnerable boys who were in his care is unforgivable.'As head of this school which is trying to provide education and care of the highest standard, I am deeply sickened and appalled by what has happened.'The very day a former pupil of the college came forward with his accusations, we immediately suspended Mr Roth and reported our concerns to the police and social services.

Impressionist Rory Bremner, right, was a pupil at the . school before Roth taught there . 'During the subsequent investigations we . have worked closely with the authorities to ensure that no stone has . been left unturned and that the police managed to gather sufficient . evidence to lead to a conviction. 'Indeed the police have publicly . acknowledged Wellington's actions and responsiveness throughout the . course of their investigations. 'Unfortunately, no vetting system can . ever guarantee that every paedophile is identified. I am happy that . Wellington offers the greatest possible protection to its pupils. We . have been praised in the highest possible terms for our pastoral care.' The elite school also counts broadcaster Peter Snow, comedian and impressionist Rory Bremner, pop star Will Young, journalist and author Sebastian Faulks among its alumni. Former pupils of King’s School include ex-Conservative cabinet minister John Gummer and former Radio 1 DJ Pete Tong. The court heard that one of Roth’s first victims contacted him years later on Facebook to ask if he was a paedophile after remembering how he had touched his groin. The boy recalled how Roth, who has toured with DJ Fat Boy Slim (Norman Cook), would often punish boys by making then strip to their underwear and run laps, or lie on their backs and memorise constellations, the court heard. Historic: Queen Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh meet staff at Wellington College in 1959, one of several royal visits to the school . Another former pupil told how Roth would enter his dormitory in the middle of the night to sit on his bed. He would tell him not to move as he carried out his vile attack. One of his victims was so traumatised that he later tried to kill himself. The court also heard that shooting enthusiast Roth’s computer was analysed by police and it was discovered that he had typed ‘teen boy sex’ into a search engine. On sentencing, Judge Simon Davis described Roth as a ‘plausible, intelligent man’, who was capable of being highly manipulative. He said his crimes at Wellington College may have been shaped by his being cleared of wrongdoing at his previous school in Kent. He said: ‘You set about abusing your privileged surroundings and position of trust in a truly grave manner. I have no doubt you carefully chose your targets.’ Roth denied all 17 charges against him, four of indecent assault on a male person under 16, four counts of sexual activity with a child, three counts of causing or inciting a child to engage in a sexual activity and six counts of sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust.

A burlesque dancer who says she was 'banned' from collecting cash for the Royal British Legion because of her 'inappropriate' costume says she is outraged by the decision. Jo Freestone, 47, who has raised money for the charity for the last 20 years, usually wears a military-style burlesque costume to gather donations in the town of Sherborne, Dorset. But the dance teacher has now apparently been told to ditch the outfit in favour of a conservative look more in keeping with the upmarket town. Jo Freestone who has collected for the poppy appeal for 20 years in Sherborne, Dorset, has been banned because of her 'inappropriate' outfit . The mother-of-three decided to raise her profile in 2010 by wearing the outfit for collections, but the local branch of the British Legion has held a vote which decided her choice of clothing was 'inappropriate'. Furious Jo, who performs as a dancer under the name of her alter ego 'Major Outrage', said she was shocked by the decision. She said: 'I’m fuming, this really has upset me. The mother-of-three, who performs under the stage name of 'Major Outrage', said she was upset by the decision . 'I’ve no idea why it’s happened, someone should have had the guts to talk to me about it and invite me to discuss the issue with them.' Jo Freestone says collecting money in the unusual attire has enabled her to raise hundreds of pounds since 2010 . The 47-year-old runs a local dancer troupe called the ‘Barmy Burlesque’ and says her burlesque outfit had helped to make her collections 'successful'. However, following the vote by local British Legion members which saw 28 of the 30 members deem the unusual choice of clothing 'inappropriate', the future of her money-raising in the outfit looked to be in doubt. But fortunately for Mrs Freestone, the main body of the charity has now stepped in. A spokesperson for the Royal British Legion has maintained that the mother-of-three will, in fact, be allowed to continue to wear her outfit when making collections. The spokesman said: 'The Royal British Legion is delighted to reassure Mrs Freestone that she is not 'banned' from collecting for the Poppy Appeal. The decision of organisers in Sherborne has no validity and Mrs Freestone is absolutely welcome to collect for the welfare of our proud British Armed Forces wherever, whenever, and in whatever outfits she pleases. 'We are confident that her cheeky and artistic burlesque costumes, in particular 'Major Outrage', will bring a smile to the faces of the public as they donate generously to the care and support of our Armed Forces family, in the certain knowledge that the Poppy Appeal supported by people up and down the UK representing all walks of life – burlesque performers most definitely included. 'We apologise to Mrs Freestone for any upset that may have been caused and look forward to seeing her collecting on the streets of Sherborne come November.' Jo, whose family were in the armed forces, has backed her unusual selling technique and said it was not intended to offend anyone. She said: 'My grandfather was a professional Shakespearean actor and a Second World War officer. 'He used to keep the spirits of his troops high with entertainers so what I’m doing is respecting what he used to do, I’m not making fun of anyone. 'I think it takes a lot of guts to dress like that and I’ve only ever had praise for it. 'It’s successful because it’s so unique, it’s so different and people want to donate more because they can see you’ve made an effort.' Mr Haynes, the Poppy Appeal organiser for Sherborne, declined to comment on the matter but said: 'All I’m worried about is getting the poppies out there. 'Sherborne is quite an ageing population with many retiring military people.'","Jo Freestone, 47, says her unique outfit has helped her to raise hundreds of pounds for charity since she started wearing it for collections in 2010 .

But it seems Britain’s 3D boom may be over before it really began. Film fans fed up with inflated  prices are choosing to stick with the traditional 2D format instead. The British Film Institute said 3D films accounted for a fifth of box office revenues last year compared to almost a quarter two years ago. Legacy: Film fans fed up with inflated prices and disillusioned by the lack of added value from watching many movies in the format, opted to stick with traditional 2D showings instead . While 47 3D films were released in 2011 – an increase of almost 20 on 2010 – takings were down. According to research compiled by the British Film Institute 3D films accounted for a fifth of box office revenues last year compared to almost a quarter two years ago. It found the average cinema in the UK made £32,000 from 3D films in 2010 but this had slumped by half to £16,000 in 2011. The BFI report said: ‘This year saw signs that UK cinema goers are becoming more selective in their choice of 3D films, choosing the format for films where it makes a real contribution to their experience but sticking to 2D where they don’t perceive any added value.’ It had been expected the 3D trend would soar after the success of James Cameron’s epic Avatar, which made £615 million worldwide, with 90 per cent of the audience watching in 3D, and the huge popularity of Toy Story 3. Hit: TT3D: Closer to the Edge was hugely popular in the format- grossing more than £1.2 million . But after an initial burst of interest it appears British cinema-goers don’t feel it represents value for money for every film. The major cinema groups charge customers of 3D films up to 41 per cent more than those seeing standard films and many charge an additional £1 for the special glasses. A spokesman for the BFI explained: ‘Perhaps audiences are becoming more discerning in terms of how they choose 3D and whether to pay the premium prices. ‘They will choose [to watch the format] when it enhances the experience. Audiences can see where the 3D conversion may not be worth the extra few pounds on the ticket. ‘ . He added that instead consumers were opting to watch in 3D when they felt it really made a difference. For example, motor-racing documentary TT3D: Closer to the Edge was hugely popular in the format – grossing more than £1.2 million, which made it one of the most popular documentaries of the year. Similarly the re-release of the Lion King in 3D was an “event” which meant many wanted to watch a classic in a new format, grossing more than £15 million. Avatar and Toy Story 3 were huge hits in the format in the UK in 2009 and 2010, grossing £67million and £73.8 million respectively in the UK. By contrast the only standout 3D hit last year was the final film in the Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2, which was the final film in the franchise and grossed £73 million.

In this film publicity image released by Warner Bros. Pictures, from left, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint and Daniel Radcliffe are shown in a scene from ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2."" (AP Photo/Warner Bros. Pictures, Jaap Buitendijk) The rest of the 3D top five for 2011, which included Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, grossed under £30 million. A recent YouGov poll found that almost half of Britons thought the format was “over-hyped and just a phase”. Another reason for the slump in interest, is that 2011 saw a rise in the popularity of character-led films in Britain such as The Kings Speech, which made £45.7 million, and Bridesmaids, which made £23 million, and these do not need the special technology. Daily Mail film critic Chris Tookey said that consumers have also wised up to the fact that sum of the “3D films” are simply a rip off. He has said: ‘Hollywood has jumped on the 3D bandwagon and is driving it hell-for-leather. ‘The irony is that many of the 3D movies that cinema-goers are paying over the odds for aren’t really in 3D at all.’ He pointed to Justin Bieber’s Never Say Never Again, which actually on featured just 30 minutes of his concert in that format. An additional problem is that some people feel unwell when watching in this format. Around 10 per cent of the UK population has poor binocular vision, which means it is difficult for them to see 3D effects in movies and video games. Instead, they see a blurry image, and will suffer headaches, eye strain and even nausea as a result. Experts do not recommend allowing children under eight to regularly use 3D glasses because their eye muscles are still developing. There are also question marks over whether 3D television will really take off, with some industry figures insisting that until a “glasses-free, affordable” option is available it is unlikey to. Some electronics manufacturers have issued disclaimers to protect themselves from legal claims warning that viewing 3D TV may cause ‘motion sickness’, ‘disorientation’ and ‘eye strain’. Last year, Sir David Attenborough warned 3D television would not take off in Britain. The veteran, whose documentary for Sky - Flying Monsters - was made in the format, insisted it would not become the norm for viewers because it was ‘too isolating’. Instead Sir David said consumers would opt to watch ‘big events’ in 3D such as World Cup football matches, Olympic sports, ground-breaking new nature or history shows.","While 47 3D films were released in 2011 – an increase of almost 20 on 2010 – takings were down .

Searchers have found the bodies of two U.S. mountaineers who perished on their way down from a 20,000 foot glacier-capped Peruvian peak in mid-July. A three-man search team found the bodies of Gil Weiss, 29 and Ben Horne, 32, on Palcaraju in the Cordillera Blanca range on Saturday. Rescue coordinator Ted Alexander says the men died in a fall off a ridge after summiting the 20,000-foot west peak. Alexander estimated the men fell nearly 1,000 feet. Found: Search teams have found the bodies of missing hikers Gil Weiss, 29, right, and Ben Horne, 32, left, who set off to climb the west summit of Palcaraju in the Cordillera Blanca range on July 11 . He says it should not be too difficult . to remove the bodies of Weiss, from Queens, N.Y., and Horne, of . Annandale, Virginia, and that can hopefully be done on Sunday. Weiss wrote a chilling blog post about . losing his life just a day before the men disappeared on a 20,000-foot . glacier-capped peak in Peru. A rumination posted by Mr Weiss on mountaineering blog pullharder.org after the death of fellow climber Michael Ybarra suggests the New Yorker suspected the Peruvian conquest may be his last. 'I sit here in a coffee shop in Huaraz, Peru, planning another foray into the Cordillera Blanca,' Mr Weiss wrote on July 10, 'where the sense that one's life is in the hands of the mountains can be as blinding as the endless white glaciers, and a thirst for glory can darken our better judgment more than the blackness of night.' Rescuers found the men's bright yellow tent at 16,700 feet next to evidence of an avalanche on Thursday. Chilling: Just one day before setting off on the climb, Mr Weiss, pictured left with Mr Horne, wrote a blog suggesting the Peruvian climb may be his last . An eight-man team from Peru's high-mountain rescue police unit was also involved in the search and the U.S. embassy and the men's families attempted to get a helicopter to join the rescue effort. 'The Peruvian government is cooperating in that they are trying to get some air support scrambled,' said Ben Horne's father, Gary Horne of Annandale, Virginia, before the men were found. 'We really need the Peruvian government involved in this. We can't do it ourselves.' Commander of the mountain rescue unit, Major Marco Carrera, said police were attempting to secure a Russian-made MI-17 helicopter to join the search. The two mountaineers had planned an excursion of between 7-10 days and their families contacted Mr Alexander after 13 days passed with no word from the two. Mr Weiss's sister, Galit, told The Associated Press by phone from New Jersey that the two men were not carrying a satellite phone. Dangerous: The Pastoruri glacier, part of the Cordillera Blanca, or 'White Mountain Range' in Huaraz, Peru, is known as one of the most dangerous (file photo) They had previously done a six-day trip that included summiting the north face of 6,162-meter Ranrapalca, according to an entry on pullharder.org by Mr Horne. Mr Horne, an economics graduate student at the University of California at San Diego, wrote that it was his first time in the Cordillera Blanca, while Mr Weiss, who has been living in Bolder, Colorado, had visited before. 'He spent a lot of time here, did a lot of hard routes' said Mr Alexander. Mr Carrera said Palcaraju is 'one of the most dangerous (peaks) to climb and it's not typical for people to climb it because the weather is difficult year-round, a combination of strong winds, avalanches and enormous crevasses.' Even though it is in the tropics, nights are freezing in the Cordillera Blanca, a range popular with climbers but also among the world's most dangerous due to the instability of snow and ice caused by wide temperatures fluctuations. Discovered: Rescuers found the men's tent, pictured, on Thursday next to signs of an avalanche. The rescuer coordinator says it should not be too difficult to remove the mens' bodies and that can hopefully be done on Sunday . Mr Alexander said the two men were aware of the risks. 'These guys are top-shelf climbers,' he added. 'This is not the first time they were on something of this caliber.' Gary Horne said his son and Gil Weiss were experienced in the type of harsh conditions found in the Peruvian Andes. 'They've done first winter ascents on certain mountains,' he said. The Cordillera Blanca climbing season runs from June to September and so far this year six mountaineers have lost their lives in the range and at least 40 have been evacuated due to medical problems, mostly altitude sickness and hypothermia, said Mr Carrera. Many of the roughly 8,000 foreigners who Mr Carrera said climb the Cordillera Blanca annually do so without hiring local guides, whose absence can make ascents more perilous as snow and ice conditions can quickly change.","Americans Gil Weiss, 29, and Ben Horne, 32, went missing on July 11 after setting off to climb west summit of Palcaraju in Peru's Cordillera Blanca range .

The brave decision by Mr Nagy, from Huddersfield, was taken despite his mother expressing her concerns and admitting that she does not completely understand what motivated him. Speaking to The Sunday Times, he said the first person he spoke to about his decision thought he was too young and should wait a while. 'By the time I had done all the research... I thought ""I am quite mature for my age, what difference is a few years going to make?"" 'If there are people on the waiting list who are in quite a bad way... what is the reason for waiting a few years?' When he applied to become a donor, doctors did not express concerns about his age. His believes this is because he had carried out thorough research into the procedure. But one person who did raise serious concerns was his mother, Karen, who said she was apprehensive about the operation. 'I'm extremely proud of him but part of me thinks 'At what point in your life as a young man do you wake up and think that this is what you want to do?' She says that when he asked her what she thought, she told him she didn't want him to do it. However, she did admit that if her son needed a kidney, she would hope there was somebody like Mr Nagy who was willing to donate one. Mr Nagy's inspiration behind his bold decision came following voluntary work for a charity helping children in Kenya. Generous: Because of Mr Nagy's decision, another person will now benefit from his kidney . After having a bad day from seeing children suffering from abuse and people living in dreadful conditions, he decided there must be something he could do to help. Mr Nagy does not know who has received his kidney or whether he will ever see them in the future. On a blog which he writes, called Altruistic Donation, My Journey to Save A Life, he said: 'I'm just an average person, no amazing talents, no special abilities, just a motive to help.' The previous youngest Good Samaritan living kidney donor was 25.",Sam Nagy took the decision despite his mother expressing her concerns .

Snooze channel: Hampshire County Council's tv channel has been dubbed 'Ken TV' after leader Ken Thornber, pictured . It is hard to imagine there are too many people keen to watch council meeting proceedings as they happen. But, clearly, Hampshire County Council thinks differently. The cash-strapped council spent £220,000 of taxpayers money on a TV channel to broadcast their meetings live. But the snooze channel only attracted 57 viewers for its last performance. Viewing figures have plummeted as those who tuned in were exposed to 'terribly boring' debates that often last for hours. Councillors have also been blasted for 'in-fighting' and talking 'waffle', as their debates are streamed worldwide over the internet. The cost works out a staggering £3869.65 per viewer for their last broadcast, which is 26 times more than a colour TV licence. One was even the daughter of a councillor who had tuned in from Hong Kong to see what her father was doing. Now there are calls for Hampshire County Council to pull the plug on the scheme, dubbed 'Ken TV' after their leader Ken Thornber. The Conservative-led council has axed 1,400 jobs since January 2011 in a bid to save £100million over two years. Those who have lost their jobs include librarians, museum workers and administrative staff. Cllr Thornber previously said: 'Reducing our costs further will neither be easy or painless.' Riveting: Hampshire County Council streamed meetings to 'encourage greater understanding' More than 800 people tuned in to watch the first televised budget in February when the ruling Tories approved cuts of £45million. But just 108 people watched May’s meeting and a mere 57 tuned in to this month’s meeting. A cabinet meeting in April was watched by 167 people, who tuned in live or delved into the council’s video archive. Conservative Cllr Thornber revealed the figures at the most recent council meeting, adding: 'Maybe Cabinet is more popular than the council.' He was heckled by a councillor on the Liberal Democrat benches, who shouted out: 'More comedy', to laughter in the chamber. The council spent £223,000 on audio, video and web-streaming equipment and paying an outside company to operate it. County chiefs hoped the project would . 'increase transparency' and 'encourage greater understanding and . participation' in local decision making. A . spokesman said at the time of launch: 'With so much of Hampshire being . rural in nature, residents from all corners of the county who may not . normally have the opportunity to attend meetings themselves, will be . able to follow the discussions and debates that are streamed live over . the internet, from a computer in their home, school or office. Scene of the TV screens: Hampshire County Council only attracted 57 viewers in its last broadcast . 'It will also be possible to watch previously webcasted meetings. 'Viewers will be able to skip through to individual items on the agenda or to individual speakers, which will make meetings even more accessible and open to all. 'By opening up some public meetings to a wider audience in this way, we hope that this will empower local residents and communities.' But Councillor Keith House, Liberal Democrat opposition spokesman, said it was a 'waste of money'. He said: 'The Liberal Democrats have always said this was a waste of money and could have helped keep library hours up or more buses or youth services in place. 'It’s always been a Conservative vanity project.' Christine Melsom, from anti-council-tax group IsItFair, said: 'The TV channel is a waste of money. 'I am not at all surprised it gets so few viewers because council meetings are terribly boring - even for someone like me who is interested in local politics.' Mrs Melsom said the broadcasts had a 'novelty value' but viewers were turned-off by meetings that last for hours, 'waffle' and party political in-fighting. However Councillor Colin Davidovitz, who is responsible for communications at the council, said he was not disappointed by the viewing figures. Cllr Davidovitz said the channel was a good use of taxpayers’ money and added: 'These viewing figures are to be expected. 'The first meeting was the budget setting meeting and there was a lot of interest. 'The Cabinet meeting also attracted interest as there was discussion about the amalgamation of a couple of schools. 'My daughter watches from Hong Kong to see what her father is up to.'","Hampshire County Council spent £223,000 on audio, video and web-streaming equipment and paying an outside company to operate it .

Despite record amounts of rainfall over the last few months, the company, which supplies millions of homes in London and the south of England, has warned that groundwater levels are still below normal. Thames Water said heavy rain in June and July removed the risk of hosepipe bans, but Britain should be hoping for a wet winter to avoid another drought. More rain needed? Try telling that to the people of Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire, who were flooded twice in a fortnight last month . Deluge: Thames Water said heavy rain in April, May, June and July removed the risk of hosepipe bans, but Britain should be hoping for a wet winter to avoid another drought . Richard Aylard, Thames Water's sustainability director, said: 'It may be hard to believe but while the current account - our rivers and reservoirs - is looking very healthy, our savings account - the natural storage basins deep below ground - remains in the red in four out of the seven river areas. 'For our invisible underground supplies to return to normal we will still need steady rainfall this winter. 'Rain in spring and summer tends to get sucked up by plants, while winter rain soaks deep into the soil to top up the groundwater.' A clutch of vital tributaries feeding the River Thames are now flowing at seven times the volume they were four months ago following the wettest spring on record. A break from the rain: Thousands of people flocked to the beach during last week's hot weather spell including these sunbathers at Woolacombe Devon . Worry: The River Pang near Bucklebury, Berkshire, dried up completely in March. Thames Water is worried there will be another bought of drought if Britain has a dry winter . The company said the incredible turnaround had safeguarded water supplies for its nine million customers this summer. It added the restored river levels had also 'saved fish and other wildlife'. In early April, after the driest two years ever recorded across the Thames Valley and London areas, the Coln in Gloucestershire, Kennet in Wiltshire, Pang in Berkshire, Wye in Buckinghamshire, Lee in Hertfordshire, Wey in Surrey and Darent in Kent averaged 33 per cent of their normal flows. The Kennet and the Pang - including the stretch near the country mansion home of Kate Middleton's parents at Bucklebury in Berkshire - dried up completely along their upper reaches, prompting fears of a drought and leading to a hosepipe ban being brought in. Recovered: Out of eight rivers only the Wye (file picture) is still flowing below average, which is down to groundwater levels taking longer to recover there . But, according Environment Agency figures, Mother Nature came to the rescue with more than two-and-a-half times the normal rainfall falling in April and June, while May and July also saw levels above average. This led to the average flows increasing to 229 per cent of their long-term average by July 20 in the seven rivers feeding the Thames. Only the Wye is still flowing below average, which is down to groundwater levels taking longer to recover there, Thames Water said. Mark Lloyd, Angling Trust chief executive, said: 'While the rain has ruined the first half of many people's summer, it has quite literally been a life-saver for fish and other wildlife in our rivers, which were in a perilous state in the spring.'","Thames Water warns groundwater levels are still below normal .

A college teacher who was hit with a £50 fine for taking her daughter out of school during term time to go on holiday has said she is ‘fuming’ at the punishment. Brenda Branch asked for permission to keep 12-year-old daughter Serena out of Philips High School in Whitefield, Bury for a family break at Butlins in Skegness. She had hoped the school would be flexible about the time off because all the exams had been completed. But when staff rejected the request .

She . said that she and her husband, Garry, 47, who works for Salford . council’s social services department, could not afford to take their . three daughters away during the summer holidays. It meant the break in Butlins was the only holiday Serena could have this year. Now her parents have been given a fixed penalty notice by Bury council for the six days unauthorised absence. Mrs .

She said: 'I spoke to my friends and they said they had just watched movies, and played games and not done much work while I was away.' Chris Trees, head teacher at the 894-pupil school, said that permission for absence during term time is only granted in ‘exceptional circumstances’ such as family bereavements. He said: 'It’s not true that the kids were just sitting around watching the videos. A lot of classes were carrying on with their work.'

Tragic: Lance Corporal James Hill, of the 1st Battalion The Coldstream Guards, was killed in October 2009 but it could have been prevented . A soldier who was about to be married was killed by an improvised explosive device (IED) in Afghanistan after the army failed to properly sweep a training area for insurgent bombs, an inquest heard today. Lance Corporal James Hill, of the 1st Battalion The Coldstream Guards, died on an 'unsecured' firing range 2.5 miles outside Camp Bastion in central Helmand on October 8 2009. Surrey Coroner Richard Travers said today the army ignored safety warnings and instead of carrying out a full four-hour search for mines, only 45 minutes was spent sweeping the area for deadly IEDs. Up to 300 service personnel would be trained on the firing range each . day, particularly in peak periods such as April and October when a new . influx of troops from the UK would arrive, he said. But the firing range was also 'swamped' by local . residents after each session who scavenged for spent ammunition cases to . sell as scrap metal, also making it easy to plant an explosive. Within nine days of L/Cpl Hill's death, the army had created a new firing range within the secure fence of Camp Bastion. Recording a verdict that L/Cpl Hill was unlawfully killed whilst on . active service in Afghanistan, Mr Travers passed on his condolences to . the soldier's family who were present for the hearing and said the army could have done more . He added that the area of the range where the soldiers waited between exercises and where . L/Cpl was killed, was not clearly marked to show where it had been . cleared with a Vallon bomb locator used by British forces. 'I find that the metal content of the IED which killed L/Cpl . Hill would have been such that the Vallon operator would have been blind . and deaf not to have registered it,' Mr Travers said. 'The register would have gone off the scale and there would have been a . loud double tone that the handler would definitely have heard. Changes: After James Hill's death the army moved their training area inside the secure Camp Bastion camp, pictured, in central Helmand . 'Concerns relating to the range team's ability to clear the range to the safest possible level in the circumstances prevailing at the time were brought to the attention of the chain of command at Camp Bastion by the range conducting officer. 'It is not clear what action, if any, was taken by the chain of command as a result of those concerns. 'Immediately after James Hill's death substantial changes were made to the firing ranges and the manner in which they were protected and in which the training was done. 'It was within the scope of the powers of the military authorities to have taken those measures prior to James Hills' death.' Speaking outside the inquest, L/Cpl Hill's parents, of Redhill, Surrey, said the Army had failed in its duty of care for their son. In a statement released jointly with their son's fiancee Anastasia Newman, they said: 'James' death totally shattered our lives and now we have been deeply hurt all over again as we have discovered that his death was needless and entirely preventable. Safety fears: Up to 300 soldiers in Afghanistan were trained on the shooting range every day but it was not properly secured . 'It was not just those responsible for planting the IED that caused his death, but a culture of complacency and a disregard for every soldier's safety that reached right up the chain of command. 'Those in charge of his safety owed him a duty of care, a duty, we feel, they totally and utterly failed. 'A proper system of communicating up and down the chain of command could possibly have prevented this tragedy. 'In addition, we have heard how the issues of resources and training, the assessment of risk and the perception of threat had a large impact on the overall situation that led to James' death. 'We can only hope that the enormity of what has happened is recognised and this is never allowed to happen again. 'James' life was irreplaceable and he meant the world to us. 'We would like to take this opportunity to put on record our gratitude to all the people who have helped us in so many ways through this most difficult of times.' When asked if he had faith in the MoD to address the issues raised by the inquest, Mr Hill said: 'Not totally, we can only hope, that is what this is all about, trying to prevent something like this happening again.' His wife added: 'We just hope to stop anything like this happening again to other families.' Mrs Hill added: 'We just had Afghanistan to get through. 'He was our only child and Anastasia and James were so happy together. 'We were just looking forward to it.' Miss Newman explained how she and L/Cpl Hill had been planning for the wedding which would have taken place following his return from Afghanistan, which was his second tour of duty there. She said: 'The wedding was planned, the dress was bought. 'James is and always will be the love of my life and I feel so grateful to have had the time I had with him. 'He will live on forever in my heart and memories until we are together again.' Lieutenant Colonel Robin Sergeant, the current commanding officer of 1st Battalion Coldstream Guards, said: 'L/Cpl Hill was a first rate Coldstreamer who loved nothing more than soldiering with his colleagues. 'He is enormously missed across the 1st Battalion Coldstream Guards and our prayers and condolences are with his family and friends.' An MoD spokesman said: 'Our thoughts remain with the family of Lance Corporal James Hill. 'Searches of the training range were carried out using Vallon detectors and no IEDs were found. 'However, an investigation into the incident showed that more thorough procedures to reduce the risk of IEDs being planted should have been carried out. 'As a result of this tragic incident, immediate steps were taken to prevent any further risk from IEDs on the range, including additional force protection. 'Since 2010, ranges have been located within the expanded perimeter of Camp Bastion and stringent checks are conducted regularly to ensure that the ranges are being used as safely as possible.'","Lance Corporal James Hill was killed by an improvised explosive device in October 2009 in an 'unsecured' training area .

Sickening: Laura Partridge shows the horrific injuries inflicted by her violent boyfriend who attacked her in the toilet of their Leicester flat . These are the horrific injuries inflicted on a woman when she was ferociously beaten by her violent boyfriend. Laura Partridge today told how she feared for her life as 'controlling and bullying' Lee Ashley Russell was jailed for three years for the attack. His drink and drug-fuelled assault left her with multiple injuries, including fractures to her cheekbone, nose and eye socket. She was so severely bruised her parents barely recognised her. It was the culmination of months of violence against her by Russell, 43, at the home the pair shared in Leicester. Following yesterday’s case at Leicester Crown Court, 32-year-old Laura said: 'I can never forgive him. I thought he was going to beat me to death. 'It’s left my life in tatters with panic attacks and flashbacks. I didn’t recognise the signs of how dangerous he was because I was so in love. 'I’d tell other women not to put up with violence from their men and get out early so they don’t end up like I did. You tell yourself it will get better, but it only gets worse.' Laura’s parents, Kim and Steven Partridge said they were 'shocked and horrified' when they saw their battered and bruised daughter at hospital. Mrs Partridge, 55, said: 'I walked down the corridor and she was sitting in a wheelchair waiting for a CT scan. I couldn’t believe what I saw. It took my breath away.' Mr Partridge, 57, said: 'I felt pure rage that anyone could do such a thing.' Laura is now trying to rebuild her life in a women’s refuge. Fighting back tears, she said: 'If it wasn’t for my family, I’d think about ending it all. He’s stripped me of the person I was.' After attending the court, she said her one-year relationship with Russell was at first 'brilliant' and she moved into his flat. He then began losing his temper at the slightest incident until one day, when she burnt an omelette, he 'smashed up' the kitchen in a rage. Before: Laura (left) told how she feared drink and drug-fuelled Lee Ashley Russell (right) was going to 'beat me to death' when he repeatedly punched her head and face with 'full-force swings' Matters came to a head on July 5 when the pair argued on their way for a drink with Laura’s friends and Russell stormed off. She later returned to the flat to collect personal items before going to stay with her mother. She did not realise Russell was at home or that he had consumed 12 pints of lager, amphetamine and cannabis. He attacked her in the toilet because did not like the fact a male friend was waiting to drive her to her mother’s. Alan Murphy, prosecuting, said: 'Russell launched a ferocious assault, repeatedly punching her head and face with both fists.' Mr Murphy said: 'He was hitting her with full-force swings.' She managed to leave the house and her friend took her to hospital. Laura’s eye injuries have left her with double vision and she faces surgery. Sentencing Russell, Judge Simon Hammond made an indefinite restraining order banning Russell, who admitted inflicting grievous bodily harm, from future contact with Laura. He said: 'It was a vicious and prolonged attack. He showed her no mercy and I won’t show him any mercy. It was as bad a case of domestic violence as I’ve seen in a long time.' He said Russell’s previous convictions included nine assaults, including an attack on a former partner in 1998. Russell told a probation officer: 'She didn’t deserve what happened and I wish I could turn the clock back.' Sally Bamford, mitigating, said Russell had issues with alcohol and as a child was the victim of domestic abuse from his father.","Laura Partridge feared Lee Ashley Russell was 'going to beat me to death'

But now it appears that llamas have become the latest recession-busting weapon in the fight against countryside crime. The aggressive south American pack animals have long been kept with goats and sheep to guard against predators, but now farmers in the UK are employing them to deter crooks. Instinctively alert and aware: Llamas have become the latest recession-busting anti-crime measure to be employed by British farmers . A survey by the insurance company NFU Mutual has found they are among some of the more unusual improvised security measures used by its members to keep their valuable property safe. Thefts cost farmers in the UK 52.7million last year, an annual rise of six per cent, the company has estimated. Other improvised methods of protecting farm equipment include keeping noisy flocks of geese to alert homeowners of intruders and storing expensive quad bikes in a pen behind a Friesian bull. But llamas are the most novel means of security the company has identified. The animals, which are of the same genetic family as the camel, have long been used by farmers in the Americas to defend livestock. Instinctively alert and aware of their surroundings, llamas draw attention to intruders - human or otherwise - by making a startling alarm call. If this is insufficient to deter the invader, the animals have been known to give chase, going on the attack with stout kicks and bites. They have, on occasion, even been known to kill predators as big as dogs or coyotes. There have been no recorded incidents of llamas bringing down UK farm robbers yet, but a survey of NFU branch offices found more that three quarters believed members were more concerned about crime than a year ago. Farmers have responded by taking more precautions, using CCTV, locks and alarms becoming to secure their possessions - however, such measures are expensive, especially in these straitened times. Fierce: Llamas respond to intruders by making a distinctive alarm call before going on the attack and have even been known to bring down coyotes . The majority of survey respondents (71 per cent) said the bulk of rural thefts were planned, with criminals preferring to operate under the cover of darkness. The survey also revealed precious supplies such as high-priced power tools, heating oil, red diesel and quad bikes were most likely to be targeted by criminals. Theft of metal and chemicals has been identified within the survey as growing trends over the last twelve months. Chemicals used for crop spraying can cost more than £600 for 10 litres. NFU Mutual believes chemicals like these are now being targeted by organised gangs who ship them abroad to meet demand across Europe. Poor economic conditions and rising commodity prices are thought to be behind the surge in rural crime. Lindsay Sinclair, Group Chief Executive of NFU Mutual, said: 'the countryside has long been seen as an easy target for criminals. 'Encouragingly, country folk are not taking the blight lying down, fighting back with both high-tech security measures as well as more innovative schemes.'","Rural crime up 6 per cent, says survey by NFU Mutual ."

A girl gang of Bulgarian pickpockets who targeted the disabled and blind in a campaign of thieving on public transport have been jailed. Gergina Georgjeva, 21, Dimitra Miteva, 33, and Parashkeva Ilieva, 40, stole mobile phones and purses from people on buses across London in a ‘deliberate campaign to make money’. One of the their victims was a blind woman on crutches. Caught pickpocketing: The three Bulgarian women will spend four months behind bars after stealing from several people across London . The trio from Tottenham, north London, used a strategy where two of them would stand near their target while the third acted as the ‘dipper’ to swipe the item. They have been jailed for four months. Prosecutor Gavin Ludlow-Thompson said the blind woman, Patricia Cairns was an easy target for their attack in February. He said: ‘She was a severely disabled person who is blind and also gets around on crutches. She therefore presented to the team, if I can call them that, an easy target.’ Miss Cairns became aware that something was amiss and tried to signal to the bus driver but the trio fled, pushing the emergency button which released the doors. Vulnerable victim: A blind woman using crutches was targeted by the gang while on board a bus in Oxford Street . Later that same day, the pickpockets stole an iPhone from a man waiting at a bus stop and on March 31 they stole a woman’s purse on board a bus in Stoke Newington, north London. They were also caught on CCTV pickpocketing in Sydenham and Brixton in south London and Tottenham in north London. In sentencing them, Judge Anthony Leonard QC said: ‘You acted as a group or in pairs of individually as professional thieves on those who were using buses through a wide area of London. ‘It included the theft of a blind and disabled person who I judge to be a vulnerable person. Stealing spree: After stealing from the blind woman, the gang snatched an iPhone from a man waiting at a bus stop . ‘Each of you may show your remorse now but that does not affect the fact that this was a deliberate campaign by the three of you to make money. ‘These offences are so serious that a fine alone or community order could not be justified.’ Police were not aware the women lived and pickpocketed together until after investigations two separate arrests. Georgjeva was arrested on May 9 and received a five-week sentence for a similar matter. Two weeks later the other two were arrested when undercover cops saw them acting suspiciously. It was when police searched their house that they discovered Georgjeva also lived with them and was part of the gang. The stolen items have never been recovered but Georgjeva was charged with handling stolen goods and theft after a purse and Oyster card were found in her possession. Mateva and Ilieva claimed they came to the UK to find legitimate work to pay for medical care of their children with heart conditions back home in Bulgaria but fell into a life of crime, their lawyers said.","The trio targeted several people on London buses including a blind woman on crutches .

Even Ms Bruni-Sarkozy's own staff had questioned the significance of the statue when she was first lady, with a spokeswoman saying: 'Carla isn't Joan of Arc or General de Gaulle. Carla is a former model.'

Despite this, Ms Bruni-Sarkozy admitted to modeling for the statue's sculptor, Elisabeth Cibot. Now an inauguration of the statue has been penciled in for September 21st, but neither Ms Bruni-Sarkozy nor her controversial husband will be in Nogent. 'She was not invited and will not be present,' said Jacques Martin, the mayor of Nogent and a member of Mr Sarkozy's UMP party. Money for the statue was originally set to come from taxpayers, but Cogedim, a local building company, are now thought to have covered the cost. The Sarkozy family, including the couple's baby daughter Giulia, are thought to have headed to Canada before the police raids in June. Their lawyers claimed they would be back within two weeks, but more than a month later they are still away, and thought to be staying with wealthy friends.","The bizarre work of art was delivered to Nogent-sur-Marne at around 6am on Tuesday morning .

More than $200million has been squandered on a scheme to train Iraqi police that Baghdad says is neither needed nor wanted. The Police Development Programme – proposed as the largest State Department programme in the world – was planned as a five-year, multibillion-dollar effort to train security forces after the U.S. army left Iraq last December. A report by the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction found that Iraq did not confirm in writing that they wanted to go ahead with the programme to the American Embassy in Baghdad. A U.S. Army Sgt. looks on as an Iraqi police officer uses his M-4 carbine assault rifle. A report claims that the U.S. wasted $200million on training the Iraqi police . Facing Baghdad's ‘disinterest’ in the project, the embassy is gutting what was supposed to be the centrepiece of ongoing U.S. training efforts in Iraq. According to the report, the embassy plans to hand over the $108million Baghdad Police College Annex to Iraqis by the end of the year and will cease training at a $98million site at the U.S. consulate in the southern city of Basra. The number of advisers has also been cut by nearly 90 percent — from 350 to 36. In a 41-page summary of their inspection, auditors concluded in the report that: 'host country buy-in to proposed programmes is essential to the long-term success of relief and reconstruction activities.' Auditors noted that it ‘has clearly been difficult’ for American diplomats to secure a solid commitment from Iraq's government to participate in the training program. Still, the report said: ‘the decision to embark on a major program absent Iraqi buy-in has been costly' and resulted in 'a de facto waste.’ The findings call into question . funding needs at the largest U.S. embassy in the world, as the Obama . administration prepares its new spending plan for the 2013 fiscal year . that begins October 1. While . auditors said it's unknown how much the embassy in Baghdad is . requesting, additional funds for the police program ‘may not be needed.’ Despite years and billions of dollars of training, Iraq's police force remains a vulnerable target for militants. Iraqi police commandos take positions in the southern city of Basra. Baghdad has been unenthusiastic about U.S. plans to train the police force . On Sunday, seven police were killed and nine more wounded in bombings and shootings near the former al-Qaida stronghold of Fallujah, about 40 miles west of Baghdad. It appeared to be the latest strike by the Sunni insurgency as it seeks to reclaim areas where U.S. troops ousted them. In a July 26 letter responding to a draft of the report, acting Assistant Secretary of State Carol Z. Perez said the embassy will need an unspecified amount of additional funding this year to continue training Iraqi police into 2013. She disputed that money has been wasted, pointing out Iraqis will continue to use the Baghdad Police College Annex for training. Perez added that the embassy has been . assured by Principal Deputy Interior Minister Adnan al-Asadi that Iraq . is committed to a streamlined version of the training programme. She . said U.S. diplomats will continue working with top security officials . ‘to ensure that our police assistance efforts meet mutual goals and . objectives and to sustain senior-level Iraqi commitment to the program.’ Auditors, . however, said those assurances fall far short of a written commitment, . and quoted al-Asadi as telling U.S. inspectors that the police training . program is ‘useless.’ They . added that Al-Asadi ‘also indicated that Iraqi police officers had . expressed their opinion that the training received to date was not . beneficial.’ Al-Asadi could not be reached for comment and his spokesman declined to comment. Iraqi policemen stand guard near the site of a bomb attack in Baghdad's Shula district on May 31, 2012. The Iraqi police force remains a vulnerable target . A key member of parliament's security oversight committee said that U.S. training programmes are no longer needed by Iraqi police. Shiite lawmaker Hakim al-Zamili said: ""The Iraqi federal police went through many training courses, in many fields, and that resulted in having many experts and specialist academies.’ ‘At this point, we don't need the American expertise, because of the expertise we have now.’ Auditors said the U.S. has spent about $8billion to train and equip Iraqi police since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion. At that time, there were about 58,000 police in Iraq. The report said that number had grown to 412,000 by 2010. Other estimates put the size of Iraq's federal, local and border police force at 650,000. Training was led by the American military until last October, just six weeks before U.S. troops left Iraq. The embassy took over the programme, but with what Monday's report described as ""mixed results."" Iraq's self-rule northern Kurdish region has embraced the programme and, as a result, half of the remaining 36 U.S. advisers assigned to police training will be based in the Kurdish capital of Irbil, 215 miles north of Baghdad. But restive politics in the central government, whose factions are reluctant to be seen as dependent on American help, have prompted officials to keep the U.S. trainers at arms' length. Some Iraqi officers have been told to skip the police training sessions, the audit said, citing one who blamed ""lukewarm relations between the Americans and Iraqis (that) has created some distance between them."" Stephanie Sanok, who was at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad from 2009 to 2010 and is an expert at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said the police training programme was ""doomed from the beginning"" because American officials never made sure Iraqis supported it. She said: ‘The U.S. government has a tendency to go ahead with programmes that it has decreed are in the host country's best interests. ‘This was such an expensive program, and there was plenty of time to get the Iraqi government to help shape it in such a way that they could eventually take it over. But we never got that buy-in.’","Baghdad has rejected the The Police Development Programme in an effort to distance themselves from the U.S .

Nine rare birds were brutally slaughtered and decapitated and over 60 animals are missing after a break-in at a zoo in Australia. Zoo owner Dick Warren arrived on Friday morning to find his animals mutilated and the doors to over 30 enclosures hosting birds, wallaby, monkeys and quolls – an endangered marsupial species – cut open. Police believe several perpetrators broke into Tasmania Zoo in Riverside, Tasmania during the night and opened the cages. Slaughtered: The birds were found decapitated or with their heads crushed when the owners arrived at Tasmania Zoo on Friday morning . Heartbreaking: The break-in has devastated the owners and zoo-keepers who care for many species unique to Australia and help local wildlife with breeding programmes . The zoo-workers were forced to clean up the bodies of their treasured birds after the vandals killed them . Dick Warren, who opened the zoo nine years ago, said the scene that met him yesterday morning was ‘heartbreaking’. ‘They've just caught them and banged their heads and pulled their heads off,’ he told ABC Television. ‘How could people do this sort of thing? It hits you so hard.’ Warren’s daughter Rochelle Penney, who co-owns the private zoo with her father, said they have spent the past days trying to re-capture the lost animals, as many will not survive in the wild. ‘A lot of our animals are in captivity for a reason and they won't survive on their own,’ she told CNN. Anger: A visibly upset Mr Warren spoke to Australian TV about his ordeal and said the vandalism and bird murders had hit him hard . Tasmania Zoo is owned by Mr Warren and his daughter who have built it up over nine years . Although a majority of the animals were re-captured more than 60 animals remain missing today, including two rare swift parrots, a yellow-tailed black cockatoo and five quolls. Animal keeper Courtney McMahon said the missing quolls has had a devastating impact on the zoo's breeding program. The rare mammal also goes by the name ‘native cat’ and is endangered in its natural habitat. Opened: Animals from these cages were set free by the trespassers who also stole two chainsaws . Vandalised: Over 30 enclosures were opened and there are still 60 animals missing from the zoo . Despite its moniker the carnivorous marsupial is a closer relative to kangaroos and Tasmanian devils than cats, and the loss of the five animals has been a painful hit for Tasmania Zoo. ‘We're trying to increase numbers of threatened species and we've lost a good part of that program,’  she said. Two chainsaws were also stolen from the zoo and police are appealing for witnesses. Animals lost: Zoo keeper Courtney McMahon said the lost quolls, an endangered mammal, was a devastating hit to the wildlife park's breeding initiative . Death sentence: The toll of missing animals also include rare bird species, wallaby and monkeys, who may not survive in the wild .","Vandals broke in to zoo in the region of Tasmania and opened 30 cages and enclosures .

Caged behind the perspex panes of a cramped Moscow courtroom cell, the three young Russian women huddle together in dejected and fearful silence as a stern-faced woman prison warden, a 3ft wooden truncheon strapped to her waist, stands guard. Terrified, separated from their children and deprived of food, water and sleep for long stretches, the three members of Russian punks-against-Putin band Pussy Riot face seven years’ imprisonment if convicted of the trumped-up charge of hooliganism levelled against them for staging an impromptu protest against President Vladimir Putin in a Moscow cathedral, an act which outraged the Russian leader. ‘It’s torture,’ whispers Maria Alyokhina as she glances anxiously towards the guard. ‘We don’t sleep and we are not given any food. But God is with me and I won’t be scared by what a man can do to me. ‘I thought the church loved its children... but it turns out it loves only the children who believe in Putin. I thought the church’s role was to call us to believe in God, not to tell us to believe in one certain president.’ The women’s protest, during which they were dressed in colourful costumes and wore knitted balaclavas, has been labelled as sacrilege. During a one-minute performance they danced around the cathedral’s altar, high-kicking, bowing, blessing themselves and chanting: ‘Mother Mary, drive Putin away.’ A video was posted on YouTube two weeks before the presidential vote in March in which Putin won a third term, despite a wave of massive protests against his rule. When Patriarch Kirill, head of the Russian Orthodox Church – who earlier had urged the congregation to vote for Putin – watched the video clip and contacted the president, the women were immediately arrested. Though terrified by the prospect of a lengthy jail sentence, Maria remains defiantly determined that she has right on her side. She is genuinely sorry if she caused offence, she says. When she was refused bail and told she had to remain in jail to protect her from angry Orthodox believers, she was furious. ‘I do not need such protection,’ she scoffs. ‘Jail does not protect me, it doesn’t make me better,’ she says sadly. ‘It just ruins me. On trial: Three members of feminist punk group . Pussy Riot, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova , left, Yekaterina Samutsevich, right . and Maria Aliokhina, centre, are on trial for putting on an anti-Putin . performance in a Moscow cathedral . The trio waits in a defendant's cage awaiting . the beginning of their trial session at the Khamovnichesky district . court in Moscow earlier today . ‘My life is like a pendulum swinging between the words nonsense and outrage. I spend my time reading letters and meeting my lawyer. And I’m reading my letters of support. Thanks to these, I can now quote the disciple Paul, who said, “God is with me, and I won’t be scared about what a man can do to me.” ‘And if Orthodox people are offended that we climbed on the altar and used it as a stage, then we ask them to forgive us. We just didn’t really know the church rules. ‘Let me assure you that we do understand them now. ‘Frankly, I consider the charges against me absurd because I live in a secular state and I am a citizen of a secular state.’ For more than five months now Maria, 24, and her fellow band members Nadia Tolokonnikova, 22, and Katya Samutsevich, 29, have languished in jail awaiting their trial, which began last week at Moscow’s Khamovniki district court. After lengthy courtroom appearances each day, the women are rarely allowed to sleep for more than four hours at night and are frequently denied food and water for up to 12 hours while cooped up in their perspex cage. Their only glimpses of daylight are during their daily drive to what is widely regarded as a Putin-orchestrated show trial. And, once inside their stuffy, airless cage, they are even denied access to the 3,000 pages of so-called evidence against them. Last week, as Putin paid a fleeting visit to London to watch the Olympic judo – while glad-handing David Cameron – he hinted that the judiciary should take a lenient view of the protest staged in Moscow’s Cathedral of Christ the Saviour. In reality, the trial could not be more crucial, coming at a pivotal point in Putin’s increasingly brutal bid to crush the crumbling remains of his country’s civil liberties. The cathedral protest which landed the three Russian punk girls in trouble with the country's authorities . Slumped in a corner of her court-room cage, Nadia, a fifth-year philosophy student who is married with a four-year-old daughter, Gera, says she doesn’t believe she is guilty of anything more than voicing her opinions; nor that the band’s stunt in the cathedral, was hooliganism or designed to incite religious hatred and hostility towards the church. ‘I’ve never performed, and I’m not going to perform, any socially dangerous acts,’ she insists. ‘And I don’t consider what I have done is a crime. It is not worth keeping me here and making my child suffer.’ All she wants, she says, is to see an end to the authoritarian stranglehold Putin has on Russia. ‘What we did was a desperate attempt to change the political system. We had no intention of insulting people. We never thought our punk appearance would cause offence. A Pussy Riot supporter is shouting slogans . outside the court ahead of the trial. Support for the women have been . wide spread including U.S. rockers Red Hot Chilli Peppers and Stephen . Fry . ‘Our mistake was bringing our political protest to a temple. We were just reacting to the patriarch calling upon the congregation to vote for Putin and his policies.’ Maria is equally convinced of her innocence. ‘The aim of our performance was to attract Patriarch Kirill’s attention. ‘We are confused by his actions and his appeals to the congregation. What we want is dialogue. ‘He says that Orthodox believers must vote for Putin. I am Orthodox but my political views are different. So what should I do?’ In the past days, the trio’s plight has attracted the backing of several high-profile musicians. In a letter to a newspaper on Friday, Jarvis Cocker, Pete Townshend, Corinne Bailey Rae and Martha Wainwright, among others, called on Putin to ensure that the trio’s trial is fair. Whether Putin intends to make examples of them or has, indeed, decided to be lenient, it is impossible to know. One thing, however, is assured: it will be, ultimately, the Russian President’s decision. As Nadia’s husband Peter Verjilov says: ‘Putin is Russia’s court. He will decide the verdict in the end.’","Trio face seven years in jail after staging cathedral performance calling for Putin to be removed from power .

The 'murderbelia' has been put up for sale by a collector through McTear's auction house and offers a rare insight into the minds of two of the 20th century’s most infamous criminals. The Kray brothers - Reggie and Ronnie - ran organised crime in the East End during the 1950s and 1960s but as nightclub owners they rubbed shoulders with the rich and famous including Judy Garland, Barbara Windsor and Frank Sinatra.

For sale: Reggie Kray's letter written while in Parkhurst prison in July 1998, left, and Charles Manson letter written while in prison for murder, right, will both be sold later this month by auction house McTear's . Reggie and his brother Ronnie were both jailed for life in 1969 for the murder of underworld figure Jack 'The Hat' McVitie. Kray’s letters, written across 20 pages and dated over several days in mid-July 1998 while Reggie was incarcerated at Parkhurst Prison, are said to be coded instructions to outside associates. In the letters, Kray wrote: 'Go to work for the fee. I’m so proud of all you’ve achieved.' It is signed off at the bottom with: 'Take care, God bless, affection, yours Reg.' Kray also makes numerous references to 'Karl', said to be outside 'muscle for hire', who would do Kray’s bidding. The letters state: '31st July at your place Karl will tell him to cook up. Talk later of him.' In the spotlight: Ronnie Kray, right, and Reggie Kray, left, in 1966 after being questioned by police about the murder of George Cornell . Happier times: Ronnie Kray, left, toasting the future happiness of his brother Reggie Kray, right, and Frances Shae after their marriage, which lasted only eight weeks before Frances left him . Kray also refers to Karl as 'so cute' but, while he was believed to be bisexual, the context is unclear. Kray’s twin brother Ronnie was openly bisexual and murdered a criminal associate for calling him a 'fat poof'. Reggie died in 2000 after a short period of compassionate release from prison, five years after his brother died in a high-security psychiatric hospital. Reggie Kray’s letters are expected to fetch hundreds of pounds at Glasgow’s McTear’s Auctioneers on Thursday. A second lot contains a letter by Charles Manson, serving a life sentence in prison for his part in the murder of seven people and 'one unborn child' in California in 1969. Amid the hippie culture of the 1960s, Manson, a charismatic ex-convict, put together a collection of runaways and outcasts known as the Manson Family. Reggie Kray, aged 66, was granted day release from prison to attend the funeral of his father Charlie Kray at Chingford Mount Cemetery in London . Reggie Kray's funeral: The hearse containing the body of infamous gangster Reggie Kray arrives at Chingford cemetery having travelled some twelve miles through London's East End past crowds of well-wishers in October 2000 . In the summer of 1969 he became one of the 20th century's most infamous criminals when he directed his mostly young, female followers to murder seven people. Among the victims was actress Sharon Tate, the pregnant wife of filmmaker Roman Polanski, who was stabbed 16 times by members of the cult in the early morning hours of August 9, 1969. Four other people also were stabbed or shot to death in Tate's home that night by the Manson followers, who scrawled the word 'Pig' in blood on the front door before leaving. The following night, Manson's group stabbed Leno and Rosemary LaBianca to death, using their blood to write 'Rise,' 'Death to Pigs' and 'Helter Skelter' - a misspelled reference to the Beatles song - on the walls and refrigerator door. Manson is serving a life sentence for those seven slayings and the murder of an acquaintance, Gary Hinman, who was stabbed to death in a separate murder in July 1969. Manson originally was sentenced to death in 1971 but was spared execution after the California Supreme Court declared the death penalty unconstitutional. In 1977, his sentence was commuted to life in prison with the possibility of parole. Murderer: Charles Manson pictured left with shaven hair and a swastika tattoo on his forehead in 1971 after being jailed for the ordering the murders of seven people including actress Sharon Tate, pictured right . Charles Manson, pictured at the age of 34, put together a group of misfits and runaways dubbed the 'Manson Family' who went on to kill seven people . His twelfth bid for freedom in April this year was denied by the parole board. Manson' undated, four-page handwritten letter written in prison includes the quotes 'the pubic (sic) are bought and sold on jelly beans ... would get their babies, cut their tongues out and break their eardrums and create a chamber of nothing'. He also describes religion as 'the biggest deceiver', adding: 'They come in all forms with words ... but what they are saying is that they need your soul'. He also refers to his relationship with 'Manson Family' members. Manson wrote: 'It can be used as the people in the so-called Family used me; by giving me their problems ... all I did was give them the answers. 'You see them singing my music and dancing my motions. That’s how I’ve survived all my life by staying on top of my end.' Steven F Scouller, a collector and true-crime author who is putting the items up for sale, said: 'Murderabilia is the name given to items that were once owned or created by notorious criminals. 'I believe that letters by such people as Charles Manson and Reg Kray should be preserved so future generations can study them in a bid to help understand the terrible decisions these criminals made.' Brian Clements, managing director at McTear’s, said: 'These are very unusual items that give an insight into the minds of two of the world’s most notorious criminals. 'It is rare to find detailed letters like these coming to auction and I expect there will be considerable interest in the sale.'","Reggie and his brother Ronnie were both jailed for life in 1969 for the murder of underworld figure Jack 'The Hat' McVitie .

Sixteen Egyptian soldiers have died after suspected Islamist militants attacked a checkpoint on the Israeli-Egyptian border on Sunday evening. The gunmen stole two of their vehicles before detonating one to blow a hole through a security fence into Israel, the country's chief military spokesman said today. Both Egypt and Israel blamed the bloody onslaught on extremists from the Hamas-run Gaza Strip and Egypt's Sinai Peninsula. Scroll down for video . Volatile territory: This map shows the Rafah border crossing on the Egypt-Gaza Strip border, where 16 Egyptians were killed by gunmen . Fear and uncertainty: Egyptians waited outside the El Arish Hospital after the attack, which killed 16 of the country's border guards . The attack was the deadliest yet sustained by Egyptian troops, who have increasingly become targets of militants along the desert border. The Israeli intelligence services claim they were able to thwart the assault after receiving advance reports of an impending attack from the Sinai Peninsula. However, the incident has raised fresh fears in Israel about the Egyptian government's ability to reassert control over the lawless Sinai region. The border had been largely quiet in the three decades since Israel and Egypt signed a peace agreement, but Sinai turned increasingly chaotic after Egypt's longtime President Hosni Mubarak was toppled last year. Militants have taken advantage of the security vacuum that followed Mubarak's ousting and have attacked Israel from the desert peninsula three times over the past year, including a cross-border assault that killed eight people last August. Israel contends that Al Qaeda operatives have infiltrated the area, as well as Palestinian militants who have crossed over from Gaza. The country is building a fence along the border with Egypt to avert attacks and block the entry of illegal African migrants. Wounded: An Egyptian soldier lies on a hospital bed in El Arish Hospital, in Egypt's northern Sinai Peninsula . Inferno: A picture released by the Israeli army shows a vehicle burning near the Kerem Shalom border crossing after the gunmen attacked . Caution: Roads were closed all night as Israel remained on high alert after what it said was a thwarted terror attack . Egypt's new President Mohammed Morsi accused the militants of 'treason' and said they would 'pay dearly' for Sunday's attack, which the Israeli military said was part of a plot to abduct an Israeli soldier. Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak demanded that Egypt do more to enforce security and prevent attacks from Sinai. 'We hope this will be a fitting wakeup call for the Egyptians to take things in hand on their side more forcefully,' he told the Israeli parliament's foreign affairs and defence committee today. Israeli military spokesman Brig.-Gen. Yoav Mordechai told Army Radio that the militants attacked the Egyptian troops at a border checkpoint, seized a truck and an armoured car, then blew up one of the vehicles to punch a hole through a security fence to enter Israel. He said Israeli intelligence services had received information about an impending infiltration and sent aircraft to strike at the second car the militants seized from the Egyptian forces. 'We were prepared for it, so there was a hit,' he said. Under guard: Palestinian security men patrol the smuggling tunnels which link Egypt and the Gaza Strip . Armed: A Hamas guard surveys the tunnel near the border town of Rafah . Barak said eight militants were killed by Israeli forces who struck from the air, as well as with tanks and artillery. The gunmen were armed with explosive devices, submachine guns and grenades, said Mordechai, who claimed the military 'averted a major attack on southern Israel.' There were no casualties among Israeli civilians. People living in the immediate area were ordered to remain in their homes while troops searched for other militants who might have remained behind, but were told this morning that they could resume their routines. An Egyptian military official said last night that Egyptian troops were pursuing militants who returned to Egypt. Egypt-Israel relations have always been cool, but since Mubarak was overthrown and Islamist parties moved to the forefront of the Egyptian political scene, Israeli officials have expressed concern that ties would deterioriate further. Sunday's attack took place around sunset near the Egyptian border town of Rafah, when the troops at the checkpoint were having the traditional meal at the end of the daily fast during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Immediately afterwards, Egypt shut the Rafah crossing with Gaza, an ominous sign for the Palestinian territory's 1.6 million people. Israel, fearing militant attacks, bars Gazans from entering Israel, so the Rafah crossing - the only passage from Gaza that is not under direct Israeli control - is their only gateway to the outside world. Leaky border: Tents cover the entrances of tunnels used for smuggling along the Gaza-Egypt border . Gaza's deputy prime minister, Mohammed Awad of the ruling Hamas movement, said militants from the territory were 'not involved in this awful crime.' But a leading Hamas member, Mohammed Zahar, undercut that denial, telling Al-Jazeera TV that he had asked Egypt to provide the names of possible suspects from Gaza so that 'we will immediately bring them to justice.' The attack could harm Hamas's efforts to persuade Morsi to ease restrictions at the crossing. Hamas is an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood and had hoped that Morsi, a fellow member of the region-wide movement, would be sympathetic to its requests. But he has moved cautiously, in part because of concerns about an influx of militants from Gaza. A senior Hamas official in Gaza confirmed that Muslim extremists with links to global jihadist groups are present in Gaza. Their numbers are small and they are tightly controlled by Hamas security, the official claimed, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the issue with reporters. Morsi convened an emergency meeting with military and security leaders following the attack, and in an interview afterward with Egyptian state TV, declared that 'this treason, this aggression and criminality cannot be appeased. Troops will totally control Sinai.' In a statement late last night, Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood urged Egyptian authorities to take all necessary measures to 'confront this serious challenge to Egyptian sovereignty and to protect Sinai from all armed groups.' Since Mubarak stepped down, Israel has allowed Egypt to send in more troops to Sinai, which has been mostly demilitarized according to the 1979 peace deal between the two countries. Sunday's attack sparked renewed calls in Egypt to amend the treaty to allow for more troops in Sinai.

The super-fit son of a top rugby league coach died of a heart attack at 19 two nights after he 'experimented' with cocaine, an inquest heard. Athletic Robbie Millward, son of Castleford Tigers boss Ian, had a seizure at his family home in Leigh, Greater Manchester, after trying the Class A drug with friends last February. The teenager was found unconscious on the sofa by his mother Leeane after she returned from a shopping . trip. Mrs Millward, 51, a nurse said: 'It was lunchtime, about 12.30pm. He . didn’t seem any different. I woke him and asked if he would go to the . shops to get me the Sunday papers but he said ""no, I’m tired, can you . get me a drink?""'. She returned home to find her son unresponsive and she carried out basic life-saving skills and called an ambulance. He was rushed to hospital but died later and forensic examinations . revealed cocaine was found in the teenager’s system which had 'scarred . and inflamed' his heart. Comforted by family members as she tried to hold back her tears in court, Mrs . Millward told the coroner: 'I’m a nurse, so when I found him his pupils . were already dilated I knew then the prognosis wasn’t very good. 'The ambulance was there very rapidly, they tried everything they could too, but he just didn’t recover.' Mrs Millward said she was unaware her son had tried drugs. Saddened: Robbie's father Ian, celebrating winning the Super League grand final, was away in France when his son died . 'I want to be able to stop somebody else doing this - every bit of that drug is harmful. I spoke to him on a couple of occasions . about all the dangers of taking them. He assured me he wasn’t taking . any,' she added. The hearing in Bolton, Greater Manchester was told the young joiner was 'very athletic and very healthy' and studying engineering three times a week. He was often seen with his father at Super League matches and was . pictured with Mr Millward senior proudly holding the World Club . Challenge in 2001 when the coach was in charge at St Helens. Tragedy struck after Robbie dabbled in cocaine use with friends while his father was on a tour of France where Castleford were playing. Robbie’s friend Christopher Mayren was asked whether Robbie may have taken cocaine on occasions, perhaps through peer pressure and he replied: 'Yes, but it was very rarely.' Death: The coroner said that although Robbie had not been a regular user of cocaine, the amount he took did something to his heart . Another pal Joshua Gannon said he knew Robbie had taken a small amount of the drug two nights before he died. Consultant pathologist Dr Simon Suvarna, who examined Robbie’s heart, concluded there were areas of inflammation and scarring on his heart. He said drugs like cocaine can cause this, as it makes the heart work harder and faster. It can also lead to dysrhythmia. Dr Suvarna said: 'It is likely that this man had an unfortunate side-effect to this drug which may not have affected other people. We all have different bodies. 'The heart doesn’t repair itself. Once you have these small areas of scarring, that’s it. 'The result is an on-going cycle of damage. I cannot explain why this young man had this, but we do see a regular and steady trickle of cases come into the autopsy room and we are aware that a low dose doesn’t mean it’s safe.' Recording a narrative verdict Bolton Coroner Allan Walsh said:'A message that needs to get out to anybody who even considers the use of cocaine, is that any use can cause damage to the heart and it doesn’t require an overdose situation or excess use. 'Robert was a 19-years-old at the time of his death. He was very athletic, very fit and very healthy. He was also a hardworking young man, who wanted to develop his education by going to college. 'He was like many people in his generation, who wanted worked hard and played hard. He had lots of friends. The loss of a son at the age of 19 is unimaginable.' He told Mrs Millward: 'Your son was not a regular user of cocaine. I’m extremely saddened by the death of Robert. I believe he was a fine young man who was hard working, enjoyed his life and was good at sport.' Robbie’s father who has coached Wigan, St Helens and Leigh Centurions, was not at the hearing but in a statement earlier this year thanked people who paid their respects. He said: 'The messages have been of comfort in this time of great sadness. 'Robbie was a healthy young boy who died from a condition called sudden adult death syndrome which comprises of a massive heart attack. The sudden nature of his death is making it even harder for us to deal with.' The teenager’s grandfather Bob who works for the Australian Rugby League said: 'It’s such a shock for the whole family. Robbie was a great kid, but now he’s gone. It’s heartbreaking. 'I remember when Ian first went over there and coached St Helens, young Rob would sit next to him in the coach’s box and the television commentators used to always call him the assistant coach.'","Robbie Millward, son of successful Australian coach Ian, had a seizure after taking the drug .

A male member of Match.com has used a spreadsheet to make sure he was able to distinguish between each of the eight women he was dating. David Merkur, a 28-year-old investment banker from New York, used the Microsoft Excel tool to record details of each of the women's characteristics as well as progress reports on how his dates with them went. Merkur told Jezebel.com he emailed the spreadsheet to Arielle, a woman he had dated, after their April 4 meeting because she 'worked with spreadsheets a lot too.' Arielle then forwarded the document to a group of her friends two days later which helped turn the document viral. Merkur, who works for real-estate finance firm Ladder Capital, wrote . to Arielle: 'Well, this could be a mistake, but what the hell... figured I might as well give you the whole thing. I hope this email . doesn't backfire, because I really had a great time and hope to hang . again soon :)' Order: David Merkur, a Match.com online dater from New York, made a spreadsheet . (pictured in part above) to keep track of the eight women he had been . dating . Perhaps most concerning was that Merkur . passed on the information without removing the girls' telephone numbers, . email addresses, full names or details about their dates, such as how . he scored their appearances. MailOnline has blurred out this personal . information to protect the girls' identities. Arielle then emailed her friends: 'Wanted to pass this on to you for some monday morning entertainment. I went on a date with this guy last wednesday. 'On the date, he tells me that he has a spreadsheet for tracking all of the people from Match that are 'in process.' Naturally, I tease him and ask him to send me the spreadsheet. For some strange reason, he actually does. See below/attached. Just when I thought I had seen it all...' The spreadsheet was split into various . categories including 'Monitor closely' and 'Monitor casually' columns. It detailed sent text messages and email exchanges as well as the venues . in which Dave and his date met. Leaked: David Merkur emailed the spreadsheet to one of his dates who . forwarded it to her friends, adding: 'Just when I thought I'd seen it . all' The . document detailed his thoughts on . the women's physical appearances, giving each a score out of ten, with . some being awarded a 7.0 or 7.5 for their 'mixed bag of pictures' on the . website. Arranged in alphabetical order, . Arielle, the woman he sent the email to, is top of the list. Not . concerned with playing it cool, he failed to remove his thoughts on her . including: 'Hope to see again soon'. Judging by her message as she . forwarded the spreadsheet to her friends, it now seems unlikely. And even though he hoped to see her . again, he did not think to remove flattering details about his other . dates including top scores for appearances, and the fact he'd 'hooked . up' with one of the girls at a party. Another entry reads: 'OK girl, but very jappy', a slang word for 'Jewish American princess'. And for a man who treats women so well . he deems it appropriate to make a spreadsheet just to remember their . names, home towns and first dates, it is perhaps unsurprising that he . wrote how one stood him up, claiming a friend was in hospital. In a second page, he lists the women he . has met through friends, rather than the dating website. With these . women, he had the forethought to remove their identities. He added in the email to Arielle: 'I . only deleted the non-match people's names (at the bottom) since some . I've known for a long time.' Merkur . told Jezebel.com he regrets making the spreadsheet, labelling it 'an . extraordinarily dumb decision'. He then explained his thought process. He . said: 'I work with spreadsheets a lot... it's a great additional tool. I . work long days, go to the gym, go out on a couple of midweek dates or . what not, get home late... how am I going to remember them? I'm not. 'So I made the spreadsheet. My comments aren't malicious or mean. This was an honest attempt to stay organised.' Serial dater: Dating Dave (who is not the man pictured in this photo) felt too time-starved to not keep a spreadsheet, he said . Merkur told The New York Post that he was sorry for making the document. 'I sincerely regret my serious lapse in judgment in this matter and apologise to everyone,' he said. 'I am deeply remorseful.' Merkur awarded his highest score for appearance, a 9.5, to Lilana Beidaut, who he described as: 'looks beautiful; from coastal Romania; Chanel make-up artist.' But he added: 'Old BF may be back in the picture.' Speaking to MailOnline, Beidaut admitted that this is a line she gives men when she is not interested. Even though Merkur was 'a really nice guy who wanted to get serious about a girl', she said she was just too busy to continue contacting him. The 26-year-old, who never met Merkur in person, insisted it was nothing he had done wrong - adding that she does not even blame him for making the spreadsheet. 'He's a smart guy and he want to keep . track of everything,' she said. 'He wanted to make sure he was approaching the women . correctly - they're all beautiful girls. He's a lucky guy.' Yet she added that she did blame Arielle for forwarding it to her friends. 'I'm blaming her,' Beidaut said. 'He trusted her. He wanted to find a cool girl and was reaching out to her. I think she was uncool. 'She could have removed my information - she could have at least removed my name. Now my details are being posted all over blogs and my phone is ringing and ringing. I should send her my phone bill.' Beidaut said that she was flattered by Merkur's description of her on the spreadsheet and the fact he had been 'persistent' in calling her. She added that she is now in a committed relationship and will not be getting back in touch with him. She does feel sorry for the last girl on the spreadsheet though, who Merkur said was 'jappy' - slang for Jewish American Princess. The girl told Jezebel.com that Merkur was 'fidgety' when the pair met, adding: 'He got up to readjust himself a few times in the middle of our conversation, which was bizarre. He kept taking his glasses off and then putting them on again.' In reference to the tag, she said she thought it was funny he had called her that, despite being shocked he had kept a spreadsheet in the first place. She recalled Merkur correctly identifying her designer handbag during their date, which probably led to the tag. 'He said his mom had it,' she said. Speaking with the Post, Merkur added: 'Suffice it to say, I will never do anything like this again.'","Investment banker David Merkur compiled spreadsheet for eight women he met on Match.com .

The omnium is renowned for being the most arduous of all the track cycling events - you must be a jack of all trades, as good at a two-lap sprint as a 30km marathon. And all that pedalling clearly works up quite a thirst - as this Belgian rider demonstrated last night. Gijs Van Hoecke was so inebriated as he left the Mahiki nightclub in Mayfair in the early hours that he had to be propped up by two friends and carried into the back of a cab to head back to the Olympic Village. Few too many: The Belgian pursuit cyclist Gijs van Hoecke needs help from two friends as he leaves the Mahiki nightclub in central London early this morning . The 20-year-old from Ghent obviously worked up quite a thirst competing in the six-race omnium event, where he finished 15th overall in an event won by Lasse Norman Hansen of Denmark . The cheeky smile on the 20-year-old's . face and his bleary eyes told of a good night, though he won't be so . pleased with the stains from the drinks thrown over him. The Ghent rider stumbled out of the . club but clearly had no idea where he was, hanging on to his friends for . dear life with his jeans slipping down his legs. And there wasn't even that much for . him to celebrate, having finished 15th in the final standings - imagine . if he'd won the gold medal. A source told Mail Online: ‘We have two tables reserved each . night for Team GB athletes to come down and celebrate. Gijs was hanging out . with the Team GB athletes drinking Mahiki Coconut cocktails and our signature . Treasure Chest drink. 'But I think he had a bit too much and had to be propped . up and supported as he left with his teammates.‘ . The event was won by the Dane Lasse . Norman Hansen, with Brit Ed Clancy winning bronze - one of a handful of . track events we haven't won. Van Hoecke was said to be drinking Mahiki's Treasure Chest cocktail, which is brandy and peach liqueur shaken with lime and sugar and topped up with Moet champagne . It was going to take more than one bottle of water to bring Van Hoecke round, as his jeans make a bid for freedom . One, two, three, lift!

Van Hoecke in action in the Flying Lap 250m time trial portion of the men's omnium event . Van Hoecke clearly has a competitive . streak - he started cycling aged 13 when the football team he played for . started losing once too often. And he clearly won the top prize for drinking last night, as his friends look comparatively sober. The 'Golden Sands' cocktail on the . Mahiki menu might be the most appropriate with the Olympics going on, . but by the end their 'Lost at Sea' tipple would have been most relevant for Van Hoecke. But the Belgian certainly wasn't alone in hitting the town last night, with athletes from all countries and sports escaping the routine of the Village to let their hair down. The British gymnasts Daniel Purvis, Kristian Thomas and Max Whitlock celebrated their bronze medals in the Team Event with a visit to Chinawhite, while the Dutch freestyle swimmer Dion Dreesens seemed to have struck gold. He was seen getting intimate with a young lady on the steps outside the club, before bouncers told him to head home.

Lucky Jubilee picnickers sat down to feast on a . five-course menu created by Heston Blumenthal ahead of a star-studded . concert to mark the Queen’s 60-year reign.at Buckingham Palace.

Now residents living near the Somerset Levels say they are facing a new problem - a plague of mosquitoes. The insects are are the latest blight on the flood-ravaged Somerset Levels. One man has even been driven to invest in that staple of African exploration, the mosquito net, to get a good night’s sleep. Jon Ryan says he has been forced to sleep with mosquito net after he was bitten between 30 and 40 times in one night . A mosquito on a wall in Somerset, where recent bad weather has boosted the numbers of the tiny biting insects . Jon Ryan lives at Godney where the flooded rivers Sheppey and Brue spread silt and rotting weed over hundreds of acres of land. He is one of many bitten by the insects which have hatched in hordes. He said: 'When we travel abroad to . hot places we expect the occasional bite but this is exceptional. I woke . up one morning with 30-40 bites on my legs. 'We have tried various sprays but . they don’t exactly do much for your breathing. A mosquito net over the . bed at night was the answer and it’s proving effective.' Nearby at Godney Farm beef and dairy . farmer Michael Churches lives near 90 acres of land which could be the . cause of Mr Ryan’s problem. Mr Ryan said a mosquito net is the only way he can get a good night's sleep . He and eight other local farmers are . among dozens across the Levels are still struggling to feed livestock as . hundreds of acres lie covered in silt, tree trunks and rotting weed nine . weeks after floods first hit. Mr Churches said: 'Some years ago they had a maintenance programme to desilt the rivers but it doesn’t happen now. 'The Sheppy and the Brue and Whitelake river, which is called the Division Rhine need to be dredged. 'They have trimmed the river, but they don’t desilt. 'The Environment Agency is financed by Defra and they say they haven’t been given the money. 'We know the land will flood but unless the rivers are desilted the water can’t be carried away quickly enough. 'Now we’ve got a thick black carpet of silt and debris. 'There are millions of mosquitoes and they carry disease such as Blue Tongue. Flooding in the Somerset Levels, which includes the River Sheppey (pictured) has led to conditions described as an 'ecological disaster' 'In the past we have been highly . commended in the Beautiful Farm awards and our land is really rich in . wildlife species but they have been destroyed.' Bridgwater and West Somerset MP Ian . Liddell-Grainger said the Department for Food, the Environment and Rural . Affairs had created an ecological disaster. He said Defra should fund Environment . Agency dredging of rivers and he called for machines currently at work . on a £29 million scheme to create major new intertidal wetland for . wildlife on the Bristol Channel coast, and protect the hamlet of Steart . to be diverted to the Levels. He claimed Richard Benyon, Minister . for the Natural Environment, had done nothing to help farmers and called . on him to wake up and smell the problem. An Environment Agency spokesman said: . 'Mosquito numbers fluctuate naturally year on year for a variety of reasons, such as temperature. Anecdotal evidence suggests the number of mosquitoes on the Somerset Levels has increased this year. 'Environment Agency teams are working to remove all the remaing flood water from the Somerset Levels, and expect pumping operations to be complete by the end of the week. 'We spend some £20 million annually on dredging in England and Wales. In many cases, however, dredging will not reduce the risk of flooding, simply because many rivers quickly silt up again as part of their natural processes. We therefore focus our efforts on dredging at those locations where it has a proven benefit of reducing flood risk.' A Defra spokesman said: 'We are . spending more than £2.1 billion on flood risk management, and are on . course to exceed our goal to better protect 145,000 homes by March 2015. 'The Environment Agency has pumped 11 . million cubic metres of water from the moors near the towns of Taunton . and Bridgwater this year alone. 'We are doing all we can to keep the . rivers in Somerset clear but dredging does not reduce the risk of . flooding because rivers quickly silt up again naturally.' A coalition of farmers, . environmentalists and local authorities has been set up to address the . problems faced on the Somerset Levels. Anthony Gibson, who is heading up the . coalition in his role as chairman of Somerset Water Management . Partnership, said: 'This must serve as a wake-up call to all concerned . as to the damage which is caused if sufficient resources are not made . available to manage water on the one hand, and to maintain the delicate . balance between farming and wildlife on the other.'","Residents living near the Somerset Levels say they are facing a new problem - a plague of mosquitoes .

"PUBLISHED: . 12:15 EST, 30 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 03:28 EST, 31 August 2012 . A controversial U.S website that allows people who need a kidney to plead directly for a donor online is launching in the UK. The NHS runs an anonymous scheme so that altruistic donors are not informed who ends up getting their kidney.  It is given to the person who is judged by a medical panel to most need it and who will benefit most from it. However, under the American scheme users who sign up to the website MatchingDonors can watch personal appeals and read about their background before deciding who they would like to donate to. One person makes an appeal via the MatchingDonors website . Many needy recipients upload videos of themselves perhaps playing the guitar, while others feature their children asking viewers to help make their parents better. Potential donors can also get in touch with the patient via a messaging service. Once a person decides they would like to donate their kidney they can check to see if they are a blood type match before their suitability is tested further. The website, based in Boston, has successfully matched around 250 strangers, which is twice as many as the NHS has managed. Paul Dooley, from MatchingDonors told ITV: 'We have wanted to come to England for the longest time. We have the ability to take our system to the UK and save their lives.' Rebecca Rogers from Ramsgate has signed up to MatchingDonors because she wants a more personal system. 'I like knowing who I am going to give my kidney to,' she told ITV. 'You don't get that in the UK. You just go to the hospital and they expect you to give it up just like that.' The website has been criticised by . doctors who say organ donations should not be decided on the basis of . who can tell the 'saddest story.' Mother-of-three Saira Khan has become the first person in the UK to sign up as a patient on the MatchingDonors website . The Human Tissue Authority (HTA), the . UK’s transplant watchdog, carried out a review which found the website . could charge up to 595 US dollars (£376.77) for patients to sign up. However, it is made clear on the website that it is illegal to offer or receive payment for the organ. Allan Marriott-Smith, Director of Strategy and Quality at the HTA said: 'We are not yet clear how it will operate here and the legal implications, and we have not had a conversation with the charity about these issues. Once we have more information, we can advise members of the public considering the possibility of arranging a donation through this route. 'We are acutely aware that organ donation can be an emotive and sensitive subject. It is our role to make sure that living organ donors give consent to the process, and to safeguard against reward being offered or sought for a donation. 'The principle of organ donations, both from living and deceased people, being a freely given gift is the basis of the law in this area. We must give careful consideration to new developments to make sure that they are within these parameters. 'We have seen an increase in the use of social networking websites which can put potential donors in contact with people who need an organ transplant. We are constantly reviewing our approach to keep pace with such developments, to make sure they meet the legal requirements.' The HTA said they would launch a new framework for the assessment of directed-altruistic donations on September 10. Patient Saira Khan who needs a kidney has become the first to sign up in the UK. The mother-of-three says she is a . qualified teacher and would love to return to her job one day. 'I need a new kidney very badly. My kidneys were destroyed through no fault of my own,' she said in her post. However, she says she is not yet on . dialysis and is currently controlling her condition with medication. It . is therefore unlikely that Mrs Khan would be viewed as a 'priority' on . the NHS transplant list.","Potential donors can watch heart-felt appeals from patients on the website .

"By . Liz Thomas . PUBLISHED: . 14:01 EST, 7 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 01:41 EST, 8 August 2012 . Fifty Shades of Grey has become the best selling book ever in Britain . IT has been panned by critics and is certainly the most talked about book of the year. And just four months after its publication in book form, Fifty Shades of Grey is outselling Dan Brown’s The Da Vinci Code and JK Rowling’s Harry Potter books, say experts. EL James’s erotic novel, released as an e-book last June and in book form in April, has sold 5.3million print and digital copies, according to publishers Random House. The other books in the trilogy, Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed, have sold 3.6million and 3.2million copies. Industry experts Nielsen Bookscan began compiling figures in 1998, and since 2003 The Da Vinci Code has held the record for the UK’s best-selling book. It has sold 5.2million copies to date in the UK and the final Harry Potter instalment, The Deathly Hallows, has sold 4.6million, said industry bible The Bookseller. While Highway Code has sold 4.9 million. Miss James said: 'My main ambition when I signed the deal with Random House was to see my books in the shops. I simply had no idea they would be so successful and this is totally unexpected. 'The whole process has been both extraordinary and rewarding. I couldn’t be more pleased with the sales and would like to thank everyone involve . Charts editor Phillip Stone said: . ‘I’m surprised at EL James breaking this record. It took Dan Brown the . best part of a year to sell 5.2million and I didn’t think it could be . beaten in my lifetime. Steamy scenes made the publisher's dreams come true: E L James, author of best selling 50 Shades of Grey, cannot believe the staggering success of her books . 'Fifty Shades has sold more in just four months. 'It took Dan Brown the best part of a . year - 50 weeks - to sell 5.2m million and I didn’t think it could be . beaten in my lifetime. '50 Shades of Grey has sold more in just four months.' He . added the success of the trilogy in the UK was in part down to the . internet hype surrounding it and the fact it had become a 'watercooler' topic. It is understood if global sales are taken into account JK Rowling’s Harry Potter series is still more popular. JK Rowling's bestseller Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows trails behind the erotic series . Pipped to the post: Author Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code has been out-sold by the runaway success of the steamy trilogy . E L James’ 50 Shades trilogy follows . the relationship between a young student and a manipulative billionaire . and features scenes of sado-masochism and domination. It comes after the erotic novel . outsold all seven Harry Potter books on Amazon last week, making author . E.L. James the website's best-selling writer ever. It . also became the website's biggest-selling book of all time, eclipsing . the sales of the previous record holder, 'Harry Potter and the Deathly . Hallows', by more than two books to one. Big hits: The second and third books in the trilogy are also hugely popular . Rights . to the book have been sold around the world and the trilogy is being . published in languages including Albanian, Chinese, Russian, Serbian and . Vietnamese. The chick-lit era may be over but it seems the huge success of 50 Shades of Grey means 'mummy porn' is set to take over. Publishers . are hailing it the 'summer of the bonkbuster' with Shirley Conran’s . classic Lace is being re-released and Mills & Boon launching a new . eBook erotica series under the banner Twelve Shades of Surrender. The Fifty Shades trilogy stemmed from EL James' love of the Twilight saga, written by Stephanie Meyer, which tracks the relationship between a vampire and a high school student in America. After reading the series of books in Christmas 2008, EL James started contributing stories to a fan fiction site dedicated to the novels. After a while, she moved beyond stories about the two main protagonists, Bella and Edward, and wrote tales based on her own creations. These were published by an Australia-based social sharing site that also functioned as a publisher, called the Writer's Coffee Shop. The fascination with Fifty Shades took off from there. By the time the book was published in America, it went straight into the New York Times' bestsellers list. A former television executive, EL James lives in West London with her husband and two sons. She has been taken aback by the incredible success of her books which she originally wrote for 'fun'. It comes as sales of chick lit have slumped with a recent survey by the Bookseller trade bible revealing the top 20 commercial women's fiction authors have slumped by a tenth in comparable sales of their new recent mass market titles against the previous ones. Mummy porn has taken over as the new must read genre for women. It has been an unexpected hit with the first novel in the franchise the fastest-selling novel of all time, both digitally and in print, outstripping Dan Brown’s The Da Vinci Code and JK Rowling’s Harry Potter books. Its availability as an e-book means people have been able to read it unashamedly and all three books have topped the Amazon charts for much of the year. Last month Mills & Boon launched a £1.99 erotic short story range with a dozen titles such as Going Down, about a young girl finding sexual freedom in Paris, Cuffing Kate, which lays bare fantasises about dominance and submission, and For Your Pleasure, about naughty neighbours. The company, famed for its romantic stories began publishing more hardcore erotica in 2008, with the Spice paperback series. But the boom in digital e-readers such as the Amazon’s Kindle, Sony’s Reader, and devices such as the iPad, means such content is more accessible anonymously, prompting them to release a new series. The revival of Shirley Conran’s Lace, three decades after it was first published and 15 years after it went out of print, is also a nod to the demand from women for books with sexual content designed for them. It was a huge hit in the 1980s despite the controversy surrounding its explicit content and was made into a mini-series for TV.","Erotic novel outsells The Da Vinci code and Harry Potter novels .

Former Shipwrecked winner Adam Child lied about his career history on This Morning forcing Phillip Schofield to brand him a 'hypocrite' This Morning presenter Phillip Schofield was left red-faced yesterday after a guest shamelessly lied about his porn career in a bid to secure 15 minutes of air time. Former Shipwrecked winner Adam Child claimed he was mortified when his glamour model fiancée TJ signed a £160,000 contract to film 24 X-rated scenes over the course of two years. At first he said he 'couldn't cope' with her decision but after receiving counselling he decided to take TJ, . whose porn name is Tommie Jo, back telling Phillip and Holly Willoughby 'I got used to it, you know'. But following the interview viewers took to Twitter highlighting the fact that Child, 28, had failed to tell the presenters that he had also been involved in the porn industry, leading to Schofield promptly branding him a 'hypocrite'. The 50-year-old broadcaster continued: 'I was looking through my Twitter feed before Adam came in and I . was alerted by a few people that he may have done porn himself. 'And so when he sat down I asked him if he had and he said ‘no, no I’ve never done it’. 'But when he left there were loads of people once again on our Twitter feed. So . I Googled him in the break and it took about 15 seconds to find him . naked on a website. 'I hate being lied to Adam I really hate it and wish . he’d been more upfront it makes his argument really rather . hypocritical.' Child appeared on the ITV series with his partner TJ who claimed 'I dumped my fiancée for a porn career.' TJ, whose real name is Coleen, openly discussed her porn career: 'It was horrible. It was really hard for . me. Being a porn star isn’t every little girl's dream you know it’s not . what I wanted to do. 'I'm purely in it for the money. In the future I want to be a dance teacher.' Meanwhile Child, who won the 2008 series of Shipwrecked, told of his distress: 'I was insecure anyway let alone my fiancé . future wife to do porn. I couldn’t physically cope with that, no way - I . don’t think a lot of men could. 'I knew she’d been with someone else. The first time she . came back I couldn't look at her in the eye.' Glamour model TJ spent 15 minutes discussing her relationship with fiancé Adam Child . 'Listen guys if you're going to come in you've got to tell us the truth,' Schofield warned Adam and TJ . The duo said they met while filming for the Sky reality TV show Dating in the Dark which gets six daters get to know each other without seeing each other. After just three months of dating Child proposed and they set a wedding day for May 2011. At the time he said he was aware that his wife-to-be had done topless and nude shots, but when she signed up to do a porn series he decided to end the relationship. But at the end of the interview Schofield questioned the reliability of both guests, after discovering that Child had previously worked as a porn star. As the news broke Child issued a statement, repeated by Schofield: 'He did it once in 2010. He lied about it because he was so embarrassed about it apparently and he still disapproves of it. 'He and TJ were offered the porn contract together and they split up because of it.' Schofield added: 'Listen guys if you’re going to come in you've got to tell us the truth.'

"By . Alison Smith-squire . UPDATED: . 12:31 EST, 2 March 2012 . Having battled with teenage anorexia that doctors feared had left her infertile, Katy Bassett was delighted when she became pregnant at the age of 27. From weighing three stone at her lowest point she had spent a decade overcoming the disease and with the help of her husband James had reached a healthy nine stone . But the condition returned to haunt Mrs Bassett during pregnancy, and she became so ill that both she and unborn Evan almost died. Terrified of getting fat, her weight . plummeted to just four stone. It meant she had to be tube-fed to . keep her and her unborn son alive. Difficult pregnancy: The picture on the left shows Evan soon after he was born 10 weeks premature. A feeding tube can be seen in Mrs Bassett's neck. She was not allowed to take care of him until he was 14 months old. In the picture on the right, Evan is three months old . Happy family: Mrs Bassett - pictured with her husband James and Evan, who is three years old - now weighs nearly 10 stone and is planning another baby . Her dramatic weight loss meant Mrs Bassett had to be taken into hospital when just 11 weeks pregnant. Evan was born early at 30 weeks, but her ‘pregorexia’ left her too frail to care for him until he was 14 months old. Mrs Bassett, now 30 and fully recovered, says: 'Evan is a little miracle. Every day I just look at him and feel so grateful he’s healthy. 'I feel so guilty because I know my dieting put Evan’s life in danger. But at the same time although realistically I knew that pregnancy would make me put on weight naturally, I felt revolted at the thought of getting bigger. 'Now I am also thankful to him – because ironically although getting pregnant sparked my eating disorder – it is Evan who cured me. I knew I had to get well if I wanted to be a proper mum.' Yet, the fact she even conceived Evan is incredible. Mrs . Bassett had a first bout of anorexic at the age of 12 and at the age of . 16 doctors warned her starving had left her infertile. Lucky to make it: Both Mrs Bassett and Evan almost died during the pregnancy after her illness meant he had to be delivered by caesarean at 30 weeks . The 6ft tall mum, who is married to James, 31, an IT consultant,  says: 'Just before I began secondary school a friend of the family died. At the same time I was always much taller than everyone else.  Although naturally slim, I felt huge.' She says: 'My mum begged me to eat and took me to see the GP. At my worst I weighed under three stone and was rushed to an eating disorders unit. I was just skin and bone. I was so poorly doctors gave me days to live.' After seven months in the clinic and weighing six stone, Katy was finally allowed home. Over the next few years she kept her weight at around six stone. But it wasn't until Mrs Bassett was 18 -  when she met husband James through friends while studying Health and Social care at College - that she recovered properly. 'James . always knew about my anorexia and for two years we were just friends,' she recalls, 'but I could always tell him anything and as time went on . we just grew closer. Then one day we kissed.' At The Priory: Evan, who was five months old when this picture was taken, was 14 months old before Mrs Bassett was well enough to look after him all the time - they have not been apart since . With his love and support, Mrs Bassett gradually gained weight and aged 27 and weighing a healthy 9st, she wed. The anorexia seemed firmly in the past, never to return again. But within three months of their wedding, she discovered she was pregnant. 'It was a shock,' she admits, 'for years . during my teens I hadn't had any periods and when aged 23 they finally . returned, doctors told me years of teenage anorexia had left me . infertile. 'But we were also delighted I was pregnant – we did want a family and James and I had planned to eventually adopt.' However, at six weeks pregnant Mrs Bassett found her old anorexic thoughts returned. 'I . felt panicky about my tummy, my whole body, getting larger,' she . confesses, 'and even when I didn’t have morning sickness, I couldn’t . bring myself to eat anything other than salad or fruit. Happy couple: Mr and Mrs Bassett on their wedding day - they met through friends with she was 18 . 'I knew I had to eat more for the baby . but I kidded myself and told James that my fruit diet was healthy . enough. I didn’t dare confide my thoughts to anyone.' Then . at 11 weeks Mrs Bassett collapsed and she was rushed to hospital. A . blood test revealed she and her unborn baby were literally starving to . death and she was immediately put on a drip. She recalls: 'I was so frightened that I begged doctors to keep me in. I knew I couldn’t be trusted to eat properly at home.' Thankfully . scans revealed unborn Evan was fine. But although her husband and . hospital staff desperately tried to encourage Mrs Bassett to eat with . tempting foods, she could only take tiny nibbles and had to be tube fed . to keep her and her unborn child alive. Happy surprise: Within three months of their wedding, Mrs Bassett, who was 27 at the time, discovered she was pregnant - more than three years later she is happy and healthy again . And at 30 weeks, when Mrs Bassett developed a life-threatening infection in her feeding tube, doctors had no choice but to deliver baby Evan early via caesarean. She barely glimpsed tiny 3Ib 10oz Evan before he was whisked into special care. Yet over the next four weeks, whilst her tiny son thrived and put on weight, she was still unable to eat. 'Now I can look at those photos of me after Evan was born and I'm shocked at how thin I was. But bizarrely I still felt fat and also after so long being tube-fed, my stomach had shrunk to the size of a tennis ball. Eating solids made me feel sick.' Sadly, while Evan went home with his father, Mrs Bassett was too frail to leave. Finally, six weeks after the birth, she was transferred to The Priory. It was to be almost a year before she was well enough to come home. 'It was heartbreaking,” she recalls, 'James was only allowed in once a week with Evan.  James was a rock and fortunately my mum helped with Evan so he could work but it was incredibly hard for both of us. And every time I saw Evan I’d cry because he seemed to have grown so much. Devastatingly I missed seeing him crawl for the first time and his first steps.' However, with intensive counselling, . her health improved. She says: 'The turning point came when James . brought Evan to visit one day.

Lisa Copley, 31, was under strict doctors' orders not to leave her bed, not even to wash or grab some food - but with horrendous consequences. Confined to a bed in Royal Surrey County Hospital in Guildford for 24 hours a day, she spent so long lying down that her muscles wasted, her legs became too weak to walk on and she broke out in red hives after suffering from a rare skin condition. Determined: Lisa Copley was so desperate to save the lives of her then-unborn twins Lucas (left) and Lola that she lay in a hospital bed for five months . Waiting game: Miss Copley spent so long lying down in Royal Surrey County Hospital that her muscles wasted and her legs became too weak to walk on . It had taken Miss Copley three cycles of IVF to become pregnant, so when doctors told her that her thin cervix made her likely to miscarry, she begged them for something to help. Surgery was pointless, she learned – her only hope was lying down permanently until the babies were strong enough for birth after 24 weeks. So Miss Copley was confined to hospital. Now, cradling twins Lola and Lucas, the proud mother says it was worth every single minute. She said: 'I went for a routine scan in August and didn’t leave hospital until December. 'Most people hate spending any time in hospital and can’t believe it when I tell them I was in for nearly half a year. 'But as a mother, you will do anything to protect your babies. I’m just thrilled that it worked.' Miss Copley’s journey began when her GP referred her to a specialist for tests to find out why she and her partner, financial planner James Richardson, 40, were unable to conceive. In 2008, she was diagnosed with polycystic ovaries and began fertility treatment soon after. But doctors also discovered that Miss Copley's cervix was fused closed, which explained why she had been unable to get pregnant. They suspected laser treatment she’d had in her early twenties to remove abnormal cells had caused a build-up of scar tissue. Rash: The 31-year-old broke out in red hives after suffering from rare skin condition PEP . Taking it easy: A cheerful Miss Copley whiles away another day in bed . Doctors tried to surgically open it in 2009 and 2010 but were unsuccessful. They told Miss Copley that her only hope of motherhood was IVF. She and Mr Richardson were given NHS funding but their first two attempts, in October 2010 and February 2011, were unsuccessful. During their next attempt, in April 2011, doctors implanted two eggs and when Miss Copley carried out a home pregnancy test days later, the line turned dark blue. She said: 'It wasn’t a faint line, it was really heavy. I thought it could be twins.' A scan confirmed that she was correct. But concerns over her cervix meant Miss Copley’s pregnancy was closely monitored from the start and – just five weeks later – alarm bells started ringing. She said: 'A scan showed my cervix had thinned to 20mm, which was half what it was actually supposed to be. 'The doctors didn’t think it was strong enough to be able to support my babies’ weight and I was told I was at a high risk of miscarriage.' Another scan at 15 weeks revealed her cervix had thinned even further, and Miss Copley was signed off work to rest. Three weeks later, her mother took her for a special scan where they were able to see the twins in 3D. Miss Copley said: 'It was incredible but then they dropped the bombshell that despite me resting, my cervix was even thinner. 'Basically, I was told that if things progressed in the same way, then I would probably lose my babies.' Before and after: It had taken Miss Copley three cycles of IVF to become pregnant and then doctors told her that her thin cervix made her likely to miscarry . Special care unit: After the twins were delivered by Caesarean, baby Lucas spent three days in intensive care . A consultant at the Royal Surrey County Hospital told Miss Copley the only hope of keeping her babies in the womb long enough to have any chance of surviving was not through hi-tech surgery or modern medicine but by, quite literally, putting her feet up. Miss Copley said: 'I was shocked, especially when they said they were admitting me immediately.' It was August last year when Lisa was wheeled to a bed in the corner of the maternity unit. She would not leave until December. 'It was overwhelming,' she said. 'At first, I set short goals, like making it through the first week.' She was told to lie as flat as possible. Washing, eating, reading and watching television would all have to be done lying down. She was not to leave her bed for anything other than toilet breaks - and those were only allowed because her bed was two steps from the cubicle. As the weeks passed, Miss Copley became used to the hospital routine. The curtains around her bed swished open each morning when nurses did their first rounds. As time went by, staff even began to recognise her choices on the hospital menu. She learned the names of all the nurses and cleaning staff and spent her time reading up on baby development. The days could be mind-numbingly boring, but worse was the knowledge that it might all be for nothing. She said: 'I knew my babies were in grave danger. They expected me to go into premature labour and I knew that if I did before 23 weeks they wouldn’t have a chance.' As summer turned to autumn, then to winter, Miss Copley stayed in the same bed, staring up at the hospital ceiling, counting the hours go by. She said: 'I was literally ticking off the days as I imagine a prisoner would do in jail.' Her first big goal was to get her babies to 24 weeks – the age when they would be entitled to medical care should they arrive early. But a 20-week scan showed her cervix was now just 8mm thick. Miss Copley was told that, due to her weak cervix, the only hope of keeping her babies in the womb long enough to have any chance of surviving was to lie in bed for months . Proud parents: Miss Copley and her partner James Richardson hold their precious twins . 'I was too scared to cough or sneeze, let alone stand up,' she said. 'I just prayed we would get to 24 weeks.' The milestone came and went – and to everyone’s relief there was still no sign of the babies. At 28 weeks, Lisa was allowed a short trip out of the ward for a tour of the special baby care unit where her twins were likely to be treated. She said: 'Doctors felt sure they would arrive any day so they wanted me to be familiar with the unit. 'But I’d been in bed so long that I could hardly stand, because the muscles on my legs had wasted away. 'When I tried to walk, I fainted. So James took me in a wheelchair but even that was exhausting for me. 'Then I began bleeding and having contractions, so I was advised not to try walking again.' At 32 weeks, Miss Copley was advised to start practising standing and taking steps. At first every step she took was a trial. At 34 weeks, medics agreed she was at last out of the danger zone and she was finally allowed home to wait for her twins to arrive. But one week later, she developed the dangerous pregnancy condition pre-eclampsia and was told the twins needed to be delivered. And on January 3, her babies were delivered by Caesarean section. Daughter Lola was placed in Miss Copley’s arms but, due to delivery complications, son Lucas was rushed to a special care unit. It was three days before he was well enough to join his mother and sister on the ward. Now the four-month-old twins are thriving. Apart from having physiotherapy to help back pain following her long stint in bed, Miss Copley has returned to full health. But she has no regrets. She said: 'When you know your babies’ lives are on the line, being in hospital for that long is easier than you think. At times I feared I wouldn’t be a mum. Now I have the perfect family.'","Lisa Copley was told her thin cervix made her likely to miscarry .

When martial arts teacher Sandra Beale-Ellis discovered one of the children in her class had Asperger’s syndrome, she set out to discover more about the condition. ‘I’d seen the film Rain Man, but that was the extent of my knowledge about autism,’ says Sandra, 44, who lives in Herne Bay, Kent. ‘So I bought a book about Asperger’s to read up about it.’ Autism is a developmental disability causing difficulties with communication and relating to other people. Undiagnosed: Teacher Sandra Beale-Ellis was surprised to recognise some of the traits of Asperger's in her husband, Joe . Asperger’s is a ‘high-functioning’ form of the condition, where sufferers often have very high IQs. Learning about its classic characteristics — social awkwardness, a love of detail and repetition, and a tendency for obsessions and collecting — Sandra was surprised  to recognise some of the traits in her husband, Joe, 50. Joe, who is the founder of Kent Karate Schools, a string of martial arts academies in Kent, owns hundreds of salt shakers he  has been collecting since he was ten, which sit in neat rows in their house. He is also obsessed with castles and runs an online tearoom review site. Sandra grew more interested, and signed up for a postgraduate certificate in Asperger’s. That was when the lightbulb moment came. Recognisable traits: The film Rain Man, pictured, was the extent of Sandra's knowledge about autism - until she realised her husband had it . ‘One of my tutors said people with autism and Asperger’s often have sensitivity to light, touch, colour or taste,’ says Sandra. ‘Joe hates clothes against his skin and would strip off to his T-shirt and underwear the minute he got home, even in winter. He hates the colour red and bright lights. I’d always called them Joe-isms. Now I realised they were signs of Asperger’s.’ Joe was sceptical, but after two years of persuasion, he saw a psychologist and after a three-hour interview he was diagnosed with mild Asperger’s. But, incredibly, there was more to come. Though Asperger’s is significantly more common in men than women, as Sandra sat in on Joe’s interview she felt pangs of recognition. ‘It was like a checklist of my own past,’ she says. ‘Like Joe, I love detail, order and lists. ‘I was in the top group for most subjects at school, but I didn’t understand fashion or dolls or boyfriends, so was often left in the corner with my book. I didn’t have any friends.’ In the two years after Joe’s diagnosis, several people on the postgraduate course asked Sandra if she thought she, too, might have Asperger’s. Sure enough, in October 2010, she had a day-long interview with psychologists and was also found to have the condition. ‘I left the interview and burst into tears,’ she says. ‘I went from feeling upset to angry to confused and sat there crying my eyes out.’ Big issue: There is a lack of understanding among GPs in spotting autism, meaning a third of adults with undiagnosed autism go on to develop severe mental health problems (file picture) According to the National Austistic Society (NAS), one in 100 adults has a form of autism. There are 225,000 adults living with Asperger’s, most of whom don’t know they have it because they can get by in mainstream life and hold down jobs. While autism was first described by psychologist Leo Kanner 50 years ago, Asperger’s wasn’t recognised in Britain until 1994. As a result, psychologists suspect the vast majority of undiagnosed adult autism cases will be those with Asperger’s who grew up before the disorder was identified. ‘By now, we are getting the diagnosis of severe autism right,’ says Dr Linda Buchan, consultant psychiatrist at the Sheffield Asperger’s Syndrome Service. ‘But adults with Asperger’s are slipping through the net because their symptoms are subtle and they may get by on their intelligence. That doesn’t mean they’re not secretly going through hell.’ The consequences of having Asperger’s and not knowing it can be severe. ‘People can develop depression and panic attacks or what psychologists call meltdowns. That’s where those with Asperger’s use so much energy to act normally that they end up exhausted and unable to get out of bed for days. Even a small change in plans can shake them.’ A recent report by the National Audit Office found eight out of ten doctors admitted they didn’t have enough knowledge or training in autism. ‘There is a lack of understanding among GPs in spotting autism,’ says Sarah Lambert, head of policy at the NAS. ‘As a result, a third of adults with undiagnosed autism go on to develop severe mental health problems.’ Indeed, when Sandra persuaded Joe to see his GP he was met with dismissal. ‘He said to Joe: “Why do you want to know? You’re successful, married, what’s the point?” He didn’t believe adults with autism even existed,’ she says. But Joe’s diagnosis was a great relief, not least because it explained his sudden, unexplained rages that had plagued their relationship since the couple met and fell in love 21 years ago. Of the 500,000 adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder, of which Asperger’s is a part, 80 per cent are men. As is common with many of them, Joe’s condition manifested itself as an anger problem. ‘Joe would lose his temper for the strangest reasons,’ says Sandra. ‘He never hurt me, but his language was hurtful and we had plenty of broken furniture and holes in the walls. ‘In the first few months there were moments when I thought about walking out. ‘Joe’s family have a history of mental illness and I wondered at first if perhaps he suffered from bipolar disorder. But we were so connected from the very beginning that I couldn’t seriously think about being without him. ‘Eventually, we worked out his triggers — tiredness, hunger and stress,’ says Sandra. ‘We arranged our lives so the triggers didn’t happen. The house was always impeccably organised and I stopped wearing red.’ Because Asperger’s in adults is largely undiagnosed, many people may be married to someone with the condition and be unaware of it, suffering rows that could have been avoided with a diagnosis, says Dr Buchan. ‘People with Asperger’s struggle with emotional displays, so their partners often interpret their behaviour as uncaring and undemonstrative. They may find it important to stick to plans and timetables, often becoming upset when their partners want to do something spontaneous.’ In women, Asperger’s symptoms can manifest as extreme passivity or anxiety, says Dr Judith Gould, consultant psychologist and director of the Lorna Wing Centre for Autism in Kent. Sandra had always been the calm one in the marriage. ‘I didn’t have Joe’s temper, but suffered from nervous anxiety instead,’ she says. ‘Women are much better at masking their symptoms, so Asperger’s can be misinterpreted as Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, shyness, anxiety or even an eating disorder because sufferers may develop obsessions with calorie counting or exercise.’ While it may seem a coincidence that Sandra and Joe both have the condition, Keith Lovett of charity Autism UK Independent says: ‘People with Asperger’s have been known to enter relationships with each another. ‘This may be because the lack of social interaction and cues between them make for a mutual understanding, but there is no scientific evidence proving a link.’ There is no medication or treatment for autism or Asperger’s, but those diagnosed benefit from care, support and therapy such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) to help everyday functioning and training in social skills. For Sandra, Joe’s diagnosis  had a positive impact on her life. ‘I no longer feel to blame for Joe’s rages and feel in control of what is going on,’ she says. Joe agrees. ‘I realised it wasn’t that I had a rotten temper, but the Asperger’s was affecting my behaviour,’ he says. ‘I have learned to control it and when I feel a meltdown or rage coming, I have time alone or listen to music to calm down.’ Sandra specialises in teaching martial arts to children with autism. ‘Being diagnosed has helped my teaching,’ she says. ‘I can identify with what the children are going through and parents are more willing to open up to me and accept my advice.’ She has learned to love the fact she and her husband are just a little different. ‘Neither Joe nor I would want to take drugs or treatments to change the fact we have Asperger’s, even if they existed,’ says Sandra. ‘Knowing we have it has made our relationship stronger and we wouldn’t change that.’",Asperger’s is a ‘high-functioning’ form of autism where sufferers often have very high IQs .

The world's biggest breast cancer charity has been accused of 'Oscar-winning' tactics that dupe women into being screened. Experts said the charity – which invented the pink ribbon logo for breast cancer awareness – was overselling the benefits of X-ray checks and ignoring the potentially harmful effects. Misleading statistics are persuading women to undergo mammography without knowing the full facts, it was claimed. Controversial: The world's biggest breast cancer charity has been accused of 'Oscar-winning' tactics that dupe women into being screened (file pic) Professor Lisa Schwartz and Steven . Woloshin, of the US Center for Medicine and the Media at The Dartmouth . Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice, said women were being . given false hope by 'deceptive' advertising. They launched an attack on the British Medical Journal's website bmj.com on advertising campaigning by the charity Susan G Komen for the Cure. They said its campaign failed to acknowledge that survival rates are distorted by the process of screening, and further bias is created by overdiagnosis of cancers that would never have caused death. 'If there were an Oscar for  misleading statistics, using  survival statistics to judge the benefit of screening would win  a lifetime achievement award hands down,' they said. The criticisms will fuel the debate in the UK about whether or not breast cancer screening does more harm than good. An independent review is under way into the NHS breast cancer screening programme to investigate whether it remains worthwhile. It is expected to report by the end of the year. In the US, there is growing awareness of a 'fine balance' between benefits and harms caused by screening. But you would not know that from charity adverts for screening which claim 'early detection saves lives', say the US professors. The adverts say: 'The five-year survival rate for breast cancer when caught early is 98 per cent. When it's not? It's 23 per cent.' The actual benefit is small, they claim. Mammography results in a reduction in the chance that a woman in her 50s will die from breast cancer over the next ten years from 0.53 per cent to 0.46 per cent, a difference of 0.07 percentage points, they said. In addition, harms are overlooked including false alarms requiring a biopsy and overdiagnosis – where women are treated for cancers that would have never have produced symptoms. The US critics claim: 'For every life saved by mammography, around two in ten women are overdiagnosed. Women who  are overdiagnosed cannot benefit from unnecessary chemotherapy, radiation or surgery.' Statistics: Mammography results in a reduction in the chance that a woman in her 50s will die from breast cancer over the next ten years from 0.53 per cent to 0.46 per cent, a difference of 0.07 percentage points, say experts . Under the NHS screening programme in England women are invited for three-yearly mammograms, or X-rays, between the ages of 50 and 70 years. The age limits are being extended to 47-73. UK cancer charities said they hoped the outcome of the NHS review would provide clarity  on the controversial screening issue. A Breast Cancer Care spokesman added: 'Until then, we know that in the majority of cases, the sooner breast cancer is detected, the greater the chances of a better outcome.' A Susan G Komen for the Cure spokesman said: 'Everyone agrees mammography isn't perfect, but it's the best widely available detection tool we have.'","Experts say cancer charity was overselling benefits of X-ray checks .

Scores of other flights had to be suspended, delaying thousands of passengers. Drama: A Virgin Atlantic Airbus A330 is surrounded by emergency services vehicles after making an emergency landing at Gatwick Airport due to a fire in the cockpit . Precautionary measure: Flights in and out of Gatwick were suspended for nearly two hours after the incident, which left 15 passengers with minor injuries . The Airbus A330 turned back just 15 . minutes into its flight to Orlando in Florida as smoke began to fill the . cabin. Some passengers accused the staff of panicking as the aircraft . landed and its emergency chutes were deployed. Liam Moore, a passenger, said everybody was ‘really shaken up’. ‘Everything seemed fine,’ he said. ‘Then the pilot came on the tannoy just a few minutes into the flight . and said we would have to do an emergency landing.

Crisis: Firefighters used powerful jets to douse the flames as evacuation slides were deployed to allow passengers off . Passenger . Tom Alridge said one of the cabin crew panicked after the  plane . touched down: ‘She was screaming like a banshee – “Get off, get off” – . she was literally pushing people down the chute,’ he said. ‘Someone has a broken ankle, another guy hit his head when he went down the chute.’ Another passenger, Mark Bell, from . Bracknell, told the BBC: ‘I knew something was wrong when we took off. The plane was really wobbly. ‘The cabin crew made things worse. They were all really panicked. We weren’t told anything other than we . had to go back to Gatwick and make an emergency landing. ‘We circled the airport twice before the landing. We were told to evacuate, evacuate, evacuate.’ Disruption: The incident caused knock-on delays to other airlines operating in and out of Gatwick (file picture), with some incoming flights being diverted . The closure is the second to hit Gatwick in three days. On Friday, all outbound flights were briefly suspended after a hot air balloon drifted into the flight path. A Gatwick spokesman said: ‘A Virgin . A330 left Gatwick at 11.48am bound for Orlando but returned to make an . emergency landing at 12.30 due to reports of a technical issue.’ The spokesman said passengers were . looked after at a reception area. Last night the airport was open again . and flights were expected to be back on schedule today. Steve Ridgway, chief executive of . Virgin Atlantic, said the flight was ‘not far out of London when the . technical alarms went off on the flight deck’. He said some passengers had gone home and others were travelling today. He promised an investigation into the incident. Queues: Passengers wait in the Gatwick departure lounge following the emergency landing, which saw the airport operating a reduced service and arrivals diverted to other airports . Warning: Customers using the airport were told by airlines including British Airways and EasyJet to expect delays and disruption . She said passengers involved were being looked after in a specially set-up reception area at the airport. Virgin Atlantic's president, Sir Richard Branson, tweeted: 'Very sorry to all passengers on board VS27. 'The staff @virginatlantic are doing everything they can to look after everybody.

When Kelly Graves went into sudden labour at home, she must have been just a little concerned that the only person to hand was her five-year-old son, Joby. But the youngster proved a more-than-able replacement for a midwife when he not only helped to deliver his newborn brother, but saved his life as well. After comforting his mother through the birth, calling for help and bringing towels to swaddle the baby, he jumped into action when Harley Jae wasn't breathing and untangled the umbilical cord from around his neck as his mother revived him. 'My little superhero': Kelly Graves with her five-year-old son Joby, who helped to deliver his baby brother Harley Jae (centre) when she went into sudden labour at their home in Mansfield . Mrs Graves has dubbed her eldest son her 'little superhero' for his bravery and quick-thinking under pressure. The 28-year-old, from Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, said: 'I really believe Joby helped to save Harley's life. If he hadn’t unlooped the cord from around his neck, I would have had to try to do it myself on my own and we would have lost valuable time. 'Harley was choking and Joby knew just what to do. I'm so proud of him, he was so calm and collected. He was absolutely fantastic and I completely underestimated him.' Kelly described how all through her pregnancy, Joby had been excited to meet his new brother or sister so it was no surprise that he was so helpful when the time came for him to deliver his new sibling. Leapt into action: As well as comforting his mother during the birth, Joby helped save his newborn brother's life by untangling the umbilical cord around his neck . She said: 'He came with me to buy all the baby clothes and all the equipment and he came with me to all the scans. He was so excited to find out he was getting a little brother and he picked the name Harley himself. 'He was my little helper around the house and whenever I got stressed he would say, ""Calm down, mummy. Think of the baby.' After a normal pregnancy, Kelly felt her first contractions on Tuesday, May 8, following a party with one of Joby’s friends at a local children's centre. On returning to Kelly's stepfather David Gledhill's house, she felt her first contraction and they steadily continued every 10 minutes. Telling her mum, Sue, 48, that the labour had started, David took Kelly home to change while her mother gathered her things from her own house nearby. The plan was for David, 61, to pick everyone up and drive to the hospital before returning home with Joby to await news of the birth. Loves him to bits: Joby has an even stronger bond with his baby brother and is always showing him off . At this point, said Kelly, no one was worried as the hospital had told them they had plenty of time. Kelly said: 'As I was speaking to the nurse over the phone, my contractions jumped from every 10 minutes to every six minutes, but she said not to worry and to ring her back in an hour. 'I'd had quite a straightforward labour with Joby so we were all expecting this one to be much the same. Nevertheless I still wanted to head into the hospital as soon as possible. 'Joby had a bath and so did I, but as my stepdad was getting him into his pyjamas I felt my waters break on the stairs. I told him to hurry and get my mum, who only lives down the road, and to come back as fast as he could.' Feeling like she needed the loo, Kelly went to the bathroom. But when she saw bleeding she panicked and called for Joby. In a flash, the little boy had run to get her phone and as Kelly dialled Joby waited for his grandmother to pick up. But then all of a sudden, Kelly was holding her newborn son in her hands. Helping him into this world: Kelly Graves said Joby had been excited to meet his new brother or sister all throughout her pregnancy . Kelly said: 'Joby was comforting me the whole way through and got towels to wrap the baby in. 'I could hear mum over the phone saying, ""Yes, we know, mummy’s having a baby"" and I remember Joby replying, ""No, the baby’s here! The baby's here!""' Unfortunately Harley was not breathing and Kelly, using sheer instinct, sucked his mouth and nose to clear it. The baby started to breathe, but then began to choke as the cord had become looped around his neck. Kelly said: 'I said, ""Oh no, Joby, the cord!"" and he asked me first if he was allowed to touch it and then quickly untangled it from around his head. 'From where I was sitting on the bathroom floor, hunched against the sink, I wouldn’t have been able to do it myself with just one hand free. I really believe he helped to save his life.' At that moment Kelly’s parents arrived and soon after the paramedics followed. After a little wait, the midwife also arrived, allowing Sue to cut the cord. Kelly said: 'Although Joby took her place as my birthing partner, she was glad that she still got to do that while Joby went and had a look at the ambulance with the paramedics. 'Joby absolutely adores his little brother and when I take Harley out he stands there proudly, showing him off. They would always have had a bond as brothers but I think it’s been made stronger by the face Joby helped him into the world. 'To think that at the age of just five he was able to help his mum have a baby and then jump in and help save him like that is amazing. 'I’ve always been so careful to drum into what to do if there’s a fire, what do to in an emergency, when to call 999 but he remembered everything. 'I think Joby might have a future ahead of him as a midwife, but when I asked him he said no, he wants to be a policeman.'","Son Joby only person on hand, but he proved a cool head under pressure .

Somerset Place was originally built between 1792 and 1800 with the initial idea to construct a much grander terrace of 20 houses. A financial crash caused by the Napoleonic Wars at the turn of the 19th . century meant  funding dried up before the project was finished and . only Numbers five to 20 were completed. In 1784 author Thomas Paine bought an area of land including Great Lydes to build houses overlooking Bath, although there is also evidence of Iron Age and Roman settlement on the area. During the heavy bombing of the city of Bath during the Bath blitz in 1942, some sections of the strip were bombed. Number 5 was completely destroyed and numbers 6 and 7 were so badly damaged that they had to be demolished for public safety. Numbers 10 to 13, spanning the centre of crescent were virtually destroyed, although the entire front facade remained standing. Numbers 8, 9 and 14 were also badly damaged and numbers 15 to 20 suffered slight damaged - all were repaired. After . the war, Bath Corporation bought the buildings for the Training College . of Domestic Science, and Numbers 5 to 7 and 10 to 13 were rebuilt in . the 1950s and 1960s, specifically as College facilities rather than as . dwellings. There are a . variety of styles and structures inside. Bath Spa University later took . over the buildings and modified them further for their own use. The entire crescent is Grade I listed even though the buildings are a mix of originals and rebuilt properties. Numbers 15 to 20 have the Georgian garden walls in place, but others do not. There are some 1950s outbuildings along St Winifreds Lane and in the gardens behind Numbers 5 to 13 which look out of place alongside a Georgian crescent, and these too are part of the original scheme.","One of Bath's famous crescent streets features nine £2million plus townhouses and 20 apartments .

"By . James Chapman . PUBLISHED: . 19:24 EST, 1 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 01:36 EST, 2 May 2012 . Advice: Transport Secretary Justine Greening . The Transport Secretary will today urge young drivers and women motorists to have ‘black boxes’ fitted in their cars to reduce sky-high insurance premiums by as much as half. Justine Greening will say that insurance costs increasingly bear ‘little relationship to the real world’, revealing figures showing that young male drivers now pay an average of almost £3,000 a year. The technology, similar to the recording devices used in aircraft, can measure speed, braking, acceleration, cornering and the time of day of a motorist’s journey. Miss Greening will suggest wider use of the technology which she says allows drivers to reduce their bills by up to 50 per cent by limiting night-time driving and demonstrating safe driving behaviour. Insurers argue that young motorists should be subjected to a strict curfew on late night driving to cut road deaths and serious injuries. Under-25s are more prone to accidents while driving late at night and early in the morning. But Miss Greening will rule out a blanket curfew, preferring the use of black boxes which could help reduce accidents as well as insurance costs. Ministers believe women drivers, who are statistically safer than men, could also benefit. High tech: Black box technology is already used in planes to record complete flight details . Currently, they pay less than men but their bills will increase from December, thanks to an EU ruling preventing gender discrimination in insurance. Miss Greening said: ‘The Government has already taken tough action to ban referral fees, reform no-win no-fee rules and crack down on fraudulent whiplash claims. But I think we can go further. ‘Why is it, when the overwhelming majority of UK young drivers are amongst the safest in the world and we are seeing faster reductions in casualties for this age group than for all drivers as a whole, that premiums are still sky high? Pugh: Black Boxes For Teenage Drivers . ‘There is no getting away from it: the cost of car insurance is bearing increasingly little relationship to the real world.’ The average motor insurance bill today is £410 – a 17 per cent rise on last year. The average premiums for young drivers are £2,977 for a young male driver and £1,682 for a female. Drivers are scored between one and five on a range of behaviours, and receive money back on their insurance if they drive safely. Estimates suggest that young drivers should see their annual premiums fall by 20 per cent. An analysis of 10,000 young driver . claims by the Co-op suggests that those with telematics or ‘black box’ insurance are 20 per cent less likely to have a car crash than those . with standard insurance. They also tend to be involved in less . serious road accidents, as the cost of a typical insurance claim from a . customer with the box is 30 per cent less than from a customer without. Amy Kilmartin, of the Co-op, said: ‘We can see that motorists with this type of insurance are genuinely driving better than those without it.’","Justine Greening believes insurance costs increasingly bear ‘little relationship to the real world’

An aristocrat's son has died while in police custody in Kenya after being arrested for allegedly smoking cannabis. Former Marlborough schoolboy Alexander Monson, 28, was taken ill a few hours after he was detained by officers in the coastal town of Diani. But he died shortly after being taken to hospital for treatment, local police said. Dead: Alexander Monson has died while on holiday in Kenya after becoming ill while in police custody . The cause of death was still under investigation last night, with the dead man’s family waiting for the results of a post-mortem examination before making a statement. But a close friend of Mr Monson, son of the 12th Baron (Nicholas) Monson, sensationally claimed ‘police brutality’ was a contributing factor in his death. The friend said: ‘He was a great guy and I would love to see those bastards go to jail for what they have done. ‘His death was a result of a combination of things. I wouldn’t say it was murder, but it was definitely a case of neglect. He was being held in custody and was not given the medical assistance he needed. It wasn’t a pre-existing medical condition, it was something else that started it. Perhaps a certain amount of police brutality.’ Contemporaries of Mr Monson at £30,300-a-year Marlborough College in Wiltshire included Pippa Middleton, also 28, but it is unclear whether they were friends. Liberal tradition: Alexander Monson's father Nicholas, pictured with his second wife Maria . Mr Monson lived in London but spent much of the year in Kenya with his mother Hilary, 58, and sister Isabella, 25. The pair run the Four Twenty South complex of self-catering cottages in the Indian ocean resort of Diani, where accommodation can cost up to £800 a night. His maternal grandparents bought the business in the 1960s. As the heir to the Monson baronetcy, Alexander was born into a life of privilege. His paternal grandfather was Lord Monson, a Lincolnshire landowner and peer. He was a champion of personal liberties who later became president of the Society for Individual Freedom. When the 11th baron died last year, the title passed to Alexander’s father, Nicholas John Monson, born in 1955. It is believed Baron (Nicholas) Monson, a publisher, is currently in Kenya with his third wife, Silvana. Last night the dead man’s grandmother, Lady Emma Monson, said: ‘I’m a widow myself. I’m bereaved. I’m now grieving for my grandson. I’m extremely upset and I just can’t talk about it.’ Kenyan Police said Mr Monson died in hospital on Saturday following his arrest. Police spokesman Richard Mugwai said he had been in custody for just a few hours when he was rushed to hospital after starting to feel sick. The officer said: ‘He was arrested outside a nightclub under the suspicion of having taken drugs. ‘We made preparations to interview and charge him but he then felt sick. We took him to the hospital and he died in the hands of the doctors.’ It is believed Mr Monson, who studied at London’s City University until 2008, entered Kenya on April 23 and was due to fly home on July 10. Mr Mugwai, the commander of Kenya’s coastal Kwale County police division, said Mr Monson was taken to the police station under suspicion of having smoked bhang, a local variety of cannabis. He was later moved to the nearby Palm Beach Hospital, where he died. A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘We have been providing consular assistance.’ Trouble in paradise: The beach at Diani Beach the popular tourist destination on Kenya's south coast where the young British tourist died . Bhang is a natural drug made from dried seeds and leaves from the female cannabis plant. Its use originated in India and it is illegal in many countries. Popular on the backpacking scene, users often mix it with fruit or alcohol. On his Facebook page, Mr Monson's father describes himself as ‘an enthusiastic cook, a relentless writer, an occasional poet, a passionate advocate, a wayward disciple of the teachings of Epicurus and the Stoics and a devoted Apostle of Alain de Botton’. Last night a friend who knew the Monson family when they lived in Bampton, Oxfordshire, said: ‘It’s awful what happened, it makes me feel sick. ‘I heard he was arrested for being drunk and disorderly with a friend. The friend was released but apparently they found drugs on Alexander so he was handcuffed and taken.’","Former Marlborough schoolboy became ill after being detained by police .

Father-of-two Mahesh Wickramasingha was stabbed to death in a struggle with Sam Harrison, 19, after he attempted to foil a hold-up on his store in Huyton, Liverpool, last year. Harrison's ten-inch knife severed the Sri Lankan-born 30-year-old's jugular vein, stopping only when the blade struck his spine.

But a jury at Liverpool Crown Court accepted the teenager’s account that the killing was an 'accident' and agreed to a manslaughter charge after he insisted his victim had 'impaled himself' on the weapon. He was jailed for ten years, which means he could be out in just over four. Today Mr Wickramasingha's relatives hit out at the verdict, claiming graphic CCTV footage proves it was murder and that Harrison should be jailed for life. Speaking from Sri Lanka, his brother Manjula said: 'It should have been murder - nobody has given us correct justice for our loss. 'We feel shame and sadness. I am out of mind and my mother is crying. 'We look at the photo of Mahesh and into his eyes, and think about how Harrison has broken our family. Mahesh went to the UK to earn money, not to die.'

Scott Cullen, 22, had set up his camera to photograph woodpeckers in the Welsh countryside when he was confronted by angry local Leslie Bickley. Bickley, 63, accused him of being a prowler and pulled out the garden scythe from under his coat. A jury heard Bickley then made Mr Cullen kneel like in a 'terrorist execution'. Weapon: Bickley accused the photographer of being a prowler and pulled a garden scythe from his coat . Birdwatcher: Scott Cullen had set up his camera to photograph woodpeckers . Mr Cullen told the court: 'He said he’d sharpened the blade and told me to feel how sharp it was. 'He said he was going to cut off my limbs one by one. 'I just curled up into a ball on the floor - he was holding the blade to me as if he was going to go for me. 'He swung it past my ears. I could feel the wind, that’s how I know it was close.' Postman Mr Cullen was headbutted by Bickley but he managed to run into a nearby river to escape. Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court heard Mr Cullen was an 'innocent and well-mannered young man' who enjoyed birdwatching and wildlife photography. He was sitting on his rucksack, dressed in camouflage trousers and jacket when Bickley attacked him. Prosecutor Ieuan Morris said: 'Bickley . frightened the life out of a young man who was doing nothing more than . taking photographs. 'He produced a hand scythe, commanding Mr Cullen to get on his knees and threatening to chop off his limbs. 'He obeyed his command and went down on his knees as if facing execution.

'He said he'd sharpened the blade and told me to feel how sharp it was.' Eugene Egan, defending, said: 'He had been beset by a problems from unknown people and thought Mr Cullen was a prowler.

The rat could not be found after the incident, which has left Mrs Vargas traumatised and fearful about using the subway to get to work every day. Following the rat attack, extra inspections have been carried out on the subway network. The MTA - which manages the subways - said it regularly cleaned subway cars and platforms which could attract rodents. The agency also said passengers can help by not eating food in the subways and throwing litter in rubbish bins. Trauma: The rat could not be found after the incident, which has left Mrs Vargas fearful about using the subway to get to work every day . Any New Yorker will tell you that rodents are a common sight in the city that never sleeps. While New York City rats may vary in colour and size, they're all one species - the Norway rat, according to the city's health department. However, larger-than-usual rats have been discovered in the city, pictured in images that spread like wildfire on the internet. In January, a photo making the rounds on Twitter showed a massive, 3-foot-long rat that was allegedly caught at a Foot Locker in the Bronx. Several months earlier, another huge rat was stabbed to death with a pitchfork by a city housing authority worker in Brooklyn. Experts say those creatures could only be Gambian pouched rats, which can grow to up to an astonishing three feet long. Last year, a YouTube video showing a rat causing panic on a subway train – and even crawling up a man's leg to his face - became an internet sensation. While rats will often leave people alone when lurking in subway stations, bites have been known to occur. Dozens of rat bite incidents are reported each year in Manhattan, and they are not to be taken lightly. A rat's extremely sharp teeth can cause tetanus or rat-bite fever if not treated properly.Symptoms of rat-bite fever include muscle pain, vomiting, joint pain, headache and rash, according to the CDC.","Ana Vargas was sitting in the train when the rodent crawled up her leg .

A man who was dragged naked, bloodied and bruised into the street by a team of 19 police officers who stormed his house has been awarded a five-figure payout. Stephen Whenary, 42, was pulled from the shower, beaten around the head with a baton, sprayed with CS gas and arrested after police received a report he had been arguing with his partner, the ex wife of an officer, in 2005. Outraged by his  extensive injuries Mr Whenary embarked on a bitter six-year campaign for justice and sued Cleveland Police for assault, false imprisonment and malicious prosecution. Stephen Whenary, pictured yesterday left, was pulled from the shower, beaten around the head with a baton and arrested after police received a report he had been arguing with his partner. This photo on the right was taken after the attack in Norton, near Stockton, Stockton-on-Tees in 2005 . The self-employed builder was unable to . return to work for 13 weeks due to the the extent of his injures as well . as the psychological trauma. At the time of the attack Mr Whenary was living with Lynne, who has been married to a police officer. He was originally charged with assaulting a police officer and resisting arrest. However, the case was thrown out by a judge after ruling that police evidence presented during the four-day trial was riddled with discrepancies. After the force agreed to settle out of court Mr Whenary said: 'I’m glad it is all over now. 'It was never about the money it was always going to be about getting them to apologise for what they did to me. Sadly, I am still waiting for them to actually say sorry. 'It is still with me every single day but hopefully I will get my life back on track. 'For six years I have struggled to work because of the psychological damage that I have suffered as a result of the attack. 'I just try not to think about it too much and try to live my life as best I can.' The incident happened at about 5.30pm on Sunday, August 21 2005 when police were called by a neighbour after hearing the defendant and his partner arguing. Evidence: Mr Whenary suffered a cut to the back of his head, lacerations to his shoulders, a large bruise on his arm, deep cuts on his feet and minor cuts and abrasions on his wrists . It is unclear why the couple were arguing. Mr Whenary suffered a cut to the back of his head, lacerations to his shoulders, a large bruise on his arm, deep cuts on his feet and minor cuts and abrasions on his wrists. Despite the trauma of the injuries he received, his relationship with Lynne survived and the pair married five years ago. Mr Whenary added: 'There was no way that I was going to let them beat me. 'It all put a lot of stress and strain on our relationship but we got through it and we are now happily married. 'We had to move out of the house where it all took place because there were just too many bad memories, but now we are in a new house, we are able to put it behind us.' Cuts: Mr Whenary's neck and shoulder were left with deep cuts and covered in blood . In December 2007, following an 18-month investigation carried out by the same force, the Independent Police Complaints Commission ruled the officers had no case to answer and would not face criminal or misconduct charges. It was revealed that the only officer to face a reprimand was PC Shaun Mahaffey, who received a superintendent’s warning after he went on holiday instead of giving evidence at the trial. It was PC Mahaffey who was alleged in court to have smashed the shower door and hit Mr Whenary over the head with his baton. At Mr Whenary’s trial in May 2006, the court was told that at one point, there were 19 officers in the house in Pine Street, Norton, near Stockton, Stockton-on-Tees, three of whom have never been traced. The court heard that nearly every officer in Stockton responded when a police constable put out a call for help. District Judge Roger Elsey was told that Mr Whenary was pulled from the shower and beaten about the head with a baton after he acted with alleged ‘superhuman’ strength. He was then dragged outside, naked and bleeding. Mr Whenary’s solicitor, Scott Taylor, of Taylor Goodchild, said: 'This has been a long protracted process but our client was determined to get the force to take responsibility for what happened and apologise for the injuries and mental trauma that it cause to him and his wife.' Following the collapse of the trial, an investigation was launched by the force’s Chief Constable Sean Price, who is currently suspended after he was arrested last August and held on suspicion of misconduct in a public office, fraud by abuse of position and corrupt practice. He has always denied the claims and is planning to take civil action, claiming unlawful arrest, false imprisonment and trespass. A . spokesman for Cleveland Police said: 'An out of court settlement was . agreed between both parties before any mediation process took place. 'Cleveland Police believe that the arrest and initial use of CS spray were lawful and proportionate to the circumstances. 'The . claim was settled as we acknowledged that there had been a . misunderstanding during the incident as to whether Mr Whenary was in . possession of a CS canister which an officer believed had been taken . from him. 'Following a complaint made by Mr Whenary, our Professional Standards Department found the complaint to be unsubstantiated. 'This . was upheld by the IPCC and therefore there were no disciplinary or . criminal matters against any officer arising out of this complaint. 'We hope that following this settlement all parties can now move on from this unfortunate incident.'","Stephen Whenary, 42, left with catalogue of injuries when 19 Cleveland Police officers stormed his Norton home and sprayed him with CS gas .
