"A new craze has coffee drinkers blending two tablespoons of butter  into their morning brew in the hope of boosting energy levels, losing weight and feeling mentally alert. The fad has taken the U.S. by storm and is now gaining traction in the U.K, with big coffee shop chains adding their own versions of the buttery coffee to their menus. Known as 'fat black' and 'paleo coffee', it was formulated by American health guru Dave Asprey who discovered yak butter tea while traversing the Tibetan mountains. Adding two tablespoons of unsalted butter - made from grass-fed cows - and a dash of coconut oil to morning coffee can provide six hours of energy, burns fat and improves cognitive function, American health guru Dave Asprey claims . Writing on his website, Mr Asprey said: 'I learned about the power of butter at 18,000 feet of elevation near Mt. Kailash in Tibet. 'I staggered into a guest house from the -10 degree weather and was literally rejuvenated by a creamy cup of yak butter tea.' Mr Asprey says the coffee will give you energy for 'six hours if you need it', programs the body to 'burn fat for energy all day long' and 'improves cognitive function'. The drink is made from a strict recipe of organic black coffee made from his trademark 'low toxin beans', which Mr Asprey claims are 'cleaner' than regular coffee. A dash of medium-chain triglyceride oil – a supplement made from refined coconut oil - is then added. This 'improves brain energy' Mr Asprey says. Next, two tablespoons of unsalted butter, preferable from grass-fed cows are melted in, and the mixture is whipped up into a froth. According to Mr Asprey, butter contains all the benefits of healthy milk fat with none of the damaging proteins found in cream, making for 'the creamiest, most satisfying' cup of coffee. Advocates swear they feel mentally alert and top of their game, able to fire on all cylinders. The drink is made from a strict recipe of organic black coffee made from his trademark 'low toxin beans', which Mr Asprey claims are 'cleaner' than regular coffee . It is used by 'recording artists before they go on stage, world champion athletes, and some of the world’s top executives', Mr Asprey claims. But others have described the taste as too rich and oily, leaving them feeling sick and uncomfortable. Critics argue the underlying science is shaky, and fear bulletproof coffee is one of the greatest marketing cons of the century. In fact, a study published in Anthropologist journal in 2004 found that Tibetan women who drank large amounts of butter tea stood a greater chance of becoming obese, 'increasing their risk for other health problems'. Nutritionists also warn those who drink the coffee are replacing their more traditional, nutritious breakfast, with something that is low in essential nutrients. And some argue butter is high in saturated fats, which raises the level of cholesterol in your blood and therefore increases your risk of heart disease and stroke. Apparently the drink is consumed by 'recording artists before they go on stage, world champion athletes, and some of the world’s top executives', Mr Asprey claims . However, others say studies have shown saturated fat has been unfairly demonized. Research published in the American journal of Clinical Nutrition in 2010 found no evidence saturated fat is associated with an increased risk of heart disease. And while butter and coffee may sound like an unlikely combination, it has actually been consumed around the world for years. Aside from the Tibetans Mr Asprey encountered, who do indeed drink yak butter and tea at high altitudes, Ethiopians commonly add spiced butter into their coffee. And in Singapore, coffee beans are often stir-fried with butter in a wok before being consumed. Nutritionist Zoe Harcome says adding butter to coffee is not a recipe for a heart attack - as long as you avoid eating carbohydrates . Nutritionists and dietitians are divided on whether bulletproof coffee can be incorporated into a healthy diet or not. Here nutritionist Zoe Harcome argues bulletproof coffee is not a path to a heart attack, while dietitian Azmina Govindji says it goes against all the principles of healthy eating. ZOE HARCOME: ITS BETTER TO FUEL ON FAT . Nutritionist Zoe Harcome says it's healthier to fuel on fat than carbohydrates. She said: 'Bulletproof coffee is drank by people following what is called a LCHF diet - Low Carb High Fat. 'This is a growing movement world wide of smart people who have worked out that fuelling on fat is much healthier and less fattening than fuelling on carbohydrate. 'It is a direct rebellion to the Low Fat High Carb official dietary advice, which has proved so disastrous for obesity, type 2 diabetes and other chronic illness since the dietary guidelines were introduced in the late 1970s/early 1980s. 'The key point for those not familiar with LCHF is that you MUST do the low carb bit if you're going to do the high fat. 'If you have a butter/coconut oil coffee with a slice of toast for breakfast you will highly likely gain weight. 'People doing LCHF are invariably consuming 20-50g of carb a day - somewhere between a couple of mugs of greens up to 2 bananas a day (although LCHF followers won't eat bananas - they'll get their carbs from veg/berries and nuts).' She added:  'Personally I would always have eggs/milk/yoghurt for breakfast, simply because these foods are nutritionally far superior to butter/oil. 'Coconut oil provides a bit of vitamins E and K and nothing else of value. 'Butter is good for the fat soluble vitamins, but not much else. 'Eggs are a fantastic already for most vitamins and minerals.' AZMINA GOVINDJI : GO FOR A SKINNY LATTE INSTEAD . Dietitian Azmina Govindji said: 'The idea of adding saturated fat to coffee goes against the principles of healthy eating and long term weight management. Dietitian Azmina Govindji says coffee with semi-skimmed milk instead of fat will give a range of nutrients for long-term health . 'Such faddy practices that promise speedy weight loss may well help you lose weight fast - but it's likely to creep back on again, and you may end up heavier than before you started. 'Adding extra fat to coffee means adding extra calories - the idea of opting for a skinny latte makes good sense, whereas adding the recommended amount of fat and butter to your coffee could set you back around 3-400kcal. 'It will probably fill you up more than a regular coffee, but having it for breakfast means there's less room for healthy breakfast foods that give you fibre and micronutrients. 'My advice would be to go for foolproof coffee - quality coffee made with semi-skimmed milk as part of a balanced whole grain breakfast.' 'It will fill you up, energise you, help keep your blood glucose levels steady, and give you a range of nutrients to keep you healthy in the long term.'","New Bulletproof coffee widely available in the U.S. has come to the U.K.

"A small stone container unearthed half-century ago has now been recognised as further evidence of a Viking or Medieval Norse presence in Arctic Canada. The discovery was made when the interior of a container, which was unearthed in Baffin Island, was found to contain bronze as well as small spherules of glass. Archaeologists believe the stone vessel was a crucible for melting bronze by a metalworker, likely in order to cast it into small tools or ornaments, during the centuries around 1000 AD. A small stone container unearthed half-century ago has now been recognised as further evidence of a Viking or Medieval Norse presence in Arctic Canada . Scientists claim this is the earliest evidence of high-temperature metalworking north of Mesoamerica – an area that describes Central America and Mexico before the 1500s. Scientists believe indigenous peoples of northern North America did not practice high-temperature metalworking. Instead, archaeologists believe Norse seafarers travelled via Greenland to parts of Arctic Canada where they came into contact with the Dorset people. Baffin Island, in the territory of Nunavut, is the largest island in Canada and the fifth largest island in the world . The discovery was made when the interior of a container, which was unearthed in Baffin Island (pictured), was found to contain bronze as well as small spherules of glass . The Dorset were hunters who occupied parts Greenland and the Canadian eastern Arctic 2,000 years before Inuit moved in from Alaska. They survived on sea mammals such as seals and walrus, often lived on the coasts in skin-covered tens and made ornaments from bone, ivory, or wood. Up until now, the view of the Dorset culture had been that they were a very isolated people with very little contact with anyone. Bronze Age beads (left) in Denmark matched the blue glass found in Tutankhamun's death mask (right) Another northern European discovery this week unearthed previously unknown trade routes for glass between Egypt, the Middle East and Denmark in the Bronze Age. The discovery was made after Bronze Age beads found in Denmark matched the blue glass inlays found in Tutankhamun's gold death mask. Twenty-three blue beads unearthed in an Ølby grave, south of Copenhagen, were analysed using a technique known as plasma-spectrometry, . The method allowed researchers to analyse the fragile bead and compare the chemical composition of trace elements with material from Amarna in Egypt and Nippur in Mesopotamia. The comparison showed that the chemicals matched exactly, marking the first time that Bronze Age Egyptian and Middle Eastern cobalt glass has been found outside the Mediterranean area. Researchers from the National Museum in Denmark and the Institute of Archaeomaterials Research in France say the latest study shows that as well as amber, Denmark and Egypt traded glass 3,400 years ago . They also believe it links two ancient sun cults, based on the fact that sunlight is able to penetrate the surface of both amber and glass. 'The crucible adds an intriguing new element to this emerging chapter in the early history of northern Canada,' said lead author Dr Patricia Sutherland, an honorary research fellow at the University of Aberdeen. Dr Sutherland has spent 15 years recovering other specimens in Arctic Canada that resemble those used by Europeans of the Viking and Medieval periods. 'It may be the earliest evidence of high-temperature nonferrous metalworking in North America to the north of what is now Mexico,' she said. Archaeologists believe Norse seafarers travelled to parts of Arctic Canada where they came into contact with the Dorset. These were hunters who occupied parts Greenland and the Canadian eastern Arctic 2,000 years before Inuit moved in from Alaska .","The Baffin Island container held bronze and small spherules of glass .

"Prime Minister Tony Abbott has said the gunman who held up to 17 people hostage at a Sydney café was known to have had 'an infatuation with extremism' and 'mental instability'. Man Haron Monis, 50, died this morning after police stormed the Lindt Chocolate Café in Sydney's Martin Place where he had held his victims for more than 16 hours. Mr Abbott confirmed that Monis was known to State and Commonwealth authorities in a statement on Tuesday morning, adding: 'we also know that he posted graphic extremist material online'. Mr Abbott confirmed that Man Haron Monis was known to State and Commonwealth authorities in a statement on Tuesday morning . Monis, 50, died on Tuesday morning after police stormed the Lindt Chocolate Café in Sydney's Martin Place where he had held about 17 people hostage for more than 16 hours . 'He had a long history of violent crime, infatuation with extremism and mental instability,' Mr Abbott said. 'We know that he sent offensive letters to the families of Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan and was found guilty of offences related to this.' However the Prime Minister dubbed the siege as only a 'brush with terrorism', stating that: 'As the siege unfolded yesterday, he [Monis] sought to cloak his actions with the symbolism of the ISIL death cult.' During the siege, Monis had forced hostages to hold up a black flag with white Arabic writing, an emblem linked to terror groups . He thanked NSW police and extended his sympathy to the families of the two hostages who died at the siege . 'He had a long history of violent crime, infatuation with extremism and mental instability,' The Prime Minister said of Monis . 'These events do demonstrate that even a country as free, as open, as generous and as safe as ours is vulnerable to acts of politically motivated violence but they also remind us that Australia and Australians are resilient and we are ready to respond,' Mr Abbott said. 'Australians should be reassured by the way our law enforcement and security agencies responded to this brush with terrorism. 'There is nothing more Australian than dropping in at the local cafe for a morning coffee and it's tragic beyond words that people going about their everyday business should have been caught up in such a horrific incident.' Mr Abbott added: 'There is nothing more Australian than dropping in at the local cafe for a morning coffee and it's tragic beyond words that people going about their everyday business should have been caught up in such a horrific incident' Mr Abbott will arrive in Sydney on Tuesday afternoon to be briefed by police and security agencies as they investigation into the siege continues . The Prime Minister thanked NSW police and extended his sympathy to the families of the two hostages who died as a result of the incident. He also revealed he would be arriving in Sydney later on Tuesday afternoon to be briefed by police and security agencies. 'Plainly, there are lessons to be learned and we will thoroughly examine this incident to decide what lessons can be learned,' Mr Abbot said.","Man Haron Monis died this morning after police stormed the Sydney Cafe where he had held about 17 hostages for over 16 hours .

"A self proclaimed 'politically incorrect conservative culture warrior' has sparked outrage after he claimed  that Australia is revisiting its gun laws in light of a 17 hour siege in a Sydney cafe. Nick Adams, while speaking to Fox News host Gretchen Carlson on Tuesday morning Sydney time, called for the weapons ban in Australia to be lifted and that citizens should have the right to be armed. Adams claimed Australians had realised the 'bad guys' shouldn't be the only ones with guns following the hostage situation at the Lindt Chocolate Cafe in Martin Place which saw two innocent people killed. Nick Adams made unfounded claims about Australians reassessing gun control following the siege in Sydney . 'I think for the first time in a long time Australians realised what it is for the bad guys to have guns, but the good people not to and there was a sense of despair, a sense of helplessness yesterday,' Adams said in a live cross to the program. 'And I know that there are a number of Australians this morning having woken up after a long, long, long night thinking to themselves what could have been if someone did have a gun on them to stop this terrible awful ordeal that people had to tragically endure,' he claimed. When asked whether the events had sparked a debate about whether Australian should reevaluate it's gun control restrictions - which were introduced after the Port Arthur massacre in 1996 where 36 people were slaughtered  in one of the deadliest shootings committed by a single person worldwide - Adams claimed that people were already discussing it. While on Fox News Adams also said the topic would be 'back on the agenda' 'I certainly think it will be back on the agenda, I think now Australians are beginning to realise what it means to not have a gun in a time when a bad person does. 'They realise that really it's enabling the bad people to be able to carry out their agenda a lot more easily, a lot more freely than they may otherwise have.' He concluded by saying he 'can certainly see a change in sentiment' and 'I think there will be a reevaluation'. In an opinion piece published by the same network, the Sydney-born man continued to make unfounded and ignorant claims about Australian attitudes towards Islam and gun control. In an opinion piece published by Fox News the Sydney-born man continued to make unfounded claims about Australian attitudes towards Islam and gun control . 'Monday’s distressing events have renewed Australians’ concerns about Islamist objectives, and a growing Islamic presence in the country,' Adams wrote. 'Interestingly, Monday’s events have also prompted Australians to revisit their gun laws,' he claimed, before adding: 'It is unsurprising that home-grown terrorism is most rampant in nations with strict gun control. It is a reality that Australia’s powerful anti-gun lobby seems to wish to ignore.' In a final comment Adams wrote that Americans with their liberal gun control laws and second amendment are 'the envy of a growing number of Australians that wish they were armed.' Adams also made waves earlier this year during another appearance on Fox News touting claims that men 'all around the world' were losing their masculinity due to feminism. In a final comment Adams wrote that Americans with their liberal gun control laws and second amendment are 'the envy of a growing number of Australians that wish they were armed . 'Basically what feminism has delivered is angry women and feminine men and it emerges from this mindset that unfortunately a lot of women have bought in to this destructive idea that men prevent them from being able to achieve their goals.' Adams then when on to describe the 'phenomenon' as 'dangerous' and claimed 'it's a very hard time to be a man in today's society.' Adams is originally from Sydney but has a fierce passion for American culture and conservatism. His website states he is: ' An inspirational author, international keynote speaker, and media commentator, he is considered an authority on American culture and the English-speaking world.' While holding office in Ashfield in Sydney's inner-west in 2005 as the youngest deputy mayor in Australia, Adams attempted to ban pigeons from his electorate. Adams is originally from Sydney but has a fierce passion for American culture and conservatism . It was during the time the threat of bird flu was spreading across the world and he told ABC Radio National at the time he wanted to eradicate the birds in case they were carrying the disease. 'Ashfield should be inhospitable to pigeons. Avian influenza does not respect borders,' Adams said. When asked how exactly he would implement such an exclusion zone around his municipality, he did not have a very effective solution. 'I'm not an expert. I'm not an accountant. I'm certainly not a pest controller. Don't ask me about procedure. What I would like to see is no pigeons in our area,' he responded.","Australian Nick Adams appeared on Fox News to talk about gun control .

"Korean Air will be punished with a flight ban or fines after the daughter of its chief executive delayed a flight with a tantrum over being served macadamia nuts she had not asked for. Cho Hyun-Ah, a former senior executive with the carrier, forced the chief cabin crew member off a New York-Seoul flight after she took exception to the snack - and the fact it was served in a bag rather a bowl. The 'nut rage' incident  caused a national uproar in South Korea - and triggered sales of macadamia nuts to soar. Scroll down for video . Cho Hyun-Ah, a former senior executive with Korean Air, forced the chief cabin crew member off a New York-Seoul flight after she took exception to being served Macadamia nuts in a bag instead of in a bowl . Korean Air now faces a fine or flight ban after Cho Hyun-Ah - the daughter of its chief executive - delayed a flight with a tantrum over being served macadamia nuts . 'We plan to impose a flight ban or a fine against Korean Air', the transportation ministry said in a statement. The flight ban could last for up to a month on an unspecified route and the fine could be up to $2 million. The ministry will also 'file formal complaints with the prosecution against Cho Hyun-Ah today' and ask them to open a criminal investigation. A ministry investigation found that 40-year-old Cho screamed and hurled abuse at a flight attendant and the chief steward during the incident on December 5, in a breach of an aviation safety law. The ministry also vowed to probe whether the firm's 'corporate culture' - criticised for being dominated by the whims of the owner family - posed any safety risk to passengers. State prosecutors are also investigating unconfirmed allegations that Cho used violence against cabin manager Park Chang-Jin. He his claims that she pushed him into the cockpit door and jabbed him with a service manual. Cho has denied reports she also made him and the flight attendant kneel and beg her forgiveness, but another passenger in first class confirmed most of Park's account. Cho Hyun-Ah, the eldest daughter of Korean Air Chairman Cho Yang-Ho and former vice president of the airline company, appears at the Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board in western Seoul . She publicly apologised and resigned from all her posts at the family-run business conglomerate Hanjin Group, which owns Korean Air, in the face of intense public uproar. Cho is one of three children of Korean Air chief executive Cho Yang-Ho, the patriarch of Hanjin Group. Her family members have a direct 10 percent stake in Korean Air, which is part of the family's Hanjin conglomerate. Cho Yang-Ho apologised publicly over his daughter's 'foolish act' and suggested he should share some of the blame for not bringing her up correctly. Cho Yang-Ho apologised publicly over his daughter's 'foolish act' and said he should share some of the blame for not bringing her up properly . The flight, with some 250 other passengers aboard, was being towed toward a runway at John F. Kenny Airport before it returned to the gate to remove the purser, causing an 11-minute delay in arrival. Analysts said the episode dramatically exemplifies the extraordinarily authoritarian mindset of the children of founding families of the country's family-oriented business conglomerates, known as 'chaebol'. 'The children or grandchildren of the founding families do not treat their company workers as colleagues. 'They simply view them as their servants', Chung Sun-Sup, CEO of Chaebul.com, an website that tracks corporate assets and practices, told AFP. Now mostly in their 30s and 40s, the children or grandchildren of the founders of 'Chaebols' have already taken over the helm of their empires, or are about to do so. 'There is a growing concern that key investment decisions... could be made on a whim of chaebol heirs and heiresses whose managerial prowess has not yet been tested,' Chung said. 'Amid insufficient oversight and checks, this bodes ill for the country's economy' where the top ten business conglomerates account for over 80 per cent of its gross domestic product, he added. But while the controversy imploded Cho Hyun-Ah career and embarrassed her family and country, South Korean retailers are experiencing the unexpected upside with sales of the macadamia nut soaring. Auction, a South Korean unit of eBay and South Korea's second-largest e-commerce website, said Monday that sales of macadamias surged nearly 12-fold during the previous five days without any promotions. It said macadamias previously made up 5 per cent of its nut sales but were now accounting for almost half. South Korea's largest online shopping retailer, Gmarket, also owned by eBay, said Macadamia nut sales jumped 20 times during the six days to Sunday compared with the previous week. The Seoul Western Prosecutors' Office probing the case on a separate request by a civic group has summoned Cho to appear for questioning Wednesday afternoon. The website of e-commerce firm Coupang showed Mauna Loa macadamia nuts were out of stock, with about 100 users asking on the comments section for the product to be quickly restocked. South Korean retailers are experiencing the unexpected upside of the controversy, with sales of the macadamia nut currently soaring .","Cho Hyun-Ah took exception to being served macadamia nuts on a flight .

"A botched restoration of a painting that was labelled 'Beast Jesus' has incredibly attracted a huge upsurge in tourism to a tiny Spanish village. In the town of Borja, northern Spain, pensioner Cecilia Giménez took it upon herself, she says with the permission of the priest, to touch up the 'Ecce Homo' (Behold The Man) painting that was stationed in the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Mercy church. The original was drawn by Elías Garcia Martínez, a Zaragoza art professor, but neglect in preserving the portrait stung Mrs Giménez into action. The painting is a 120-year-old fresco. Scroll down for video . The 120-year-old painting was in a state of disrepair, so Mrs Giménez stepped in with her paintbrush . However, her brushwork completely obliterated the face of Jesus, transforming the painting into what locals described more like a hedgehog or monkey than Jesus. But since the makeover, the restoration has attracted 150,000 tourists from all over the world, with people paying 80p (1 euro) to view the 'masterpiece'. Speaking after news of her work broke, Mrs Giménez told Spanish TV: 'We have always repaired everything ourselves here. The priest knew about it. Of course he did. 'How could I do something like that without permission? I did not do it in secret. Anybody who entered the church was able to see me painting. 'I had nothing but good intentions and always believed I was doing the right thing. Besides, I hadn't finished the painting!' Mrs Giménez (left) has become some sort of celebrity in the Spanish town of Borja after she completely transformed the Ecce Homo' (Behold The Man) painting (pictured right) Her handiwork has seen Giménez commissioned to design logos for the local winery, and the image of the new 'face of Jesus' adorns the town of 5,000's lottery tickets. However not everyone is happy with the developments. The grandchildren of the original artist sent a letter through a lawyer requesting the painting be destroyed as it brought shame on the original work and 'damages the honour of the family.' However, a professional study decided it was impossible to restore the piece - in essence, Mrs Giménez's painting has become a 'new piece'.","Cecilia Giménez  touched up 120-year-old 'Ecce Homo' (Behold The Man)

"For more than 400 years, the bodies of sailors who perished on the Mary Rose were preserved in silt in the Solent. Experts are using a combination of DNA analysis and pioneering laser technology to learn more about what life would have been like on Henry VIII’s flagship. And now bones taken from the sea bed have revealed that rickets may have been prevalent throughout the crew. The tibia bones of sailors (pictured) who sailed on Henry VIII’s Mary Rose ship were analysed at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital (RNOH). The deformations in the abnormal bones were suspected to be due to a metabolic bone disease such as rickets, caused by poor diets of the time . The Mary Rose was Henry VIII’s flagship before it sank in battle on the 19th July 1545, resulting in the death of more than 400 men. The bones of sailors, as well as a dog called Hatch, and artefacts from the wreckage, were raised from the Solent in October 1982. In particular, two sets of tibia bones were found that appeared anatomically healthy, but were abnormal in shape. The deformations in these bones, obtained from The Mary Rose Trust, were suspected to be due to a metabolic bone disease. Experts from the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital (RNOH) used a process called Raman spectroscopy to analyse the chemical composition of the bones (pictured). Raman is a non-destructive laser technology that uses the beams of laser light to see changes in chemical composition across the bones . The Mary Rose (illustrated) was Henry VIII’s flagship before it sank in battle on the 19th July 1545, resulting in the death of more than 400 men. It is the first time Raman spectroscopy has been used to study bone diseases in historical populations . Experts from the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital (RNOH) used a process called Raman spectroscopy to analyse the chemical composition of these bones. Raman is a non-destructive laser technology that uses the beams of light to see changes in chemical composition across samples. The team then compared these historical bones to ‘normal’ bones donated by the Vesalius Centre at the University of Bristol. It is the first time Raman spectroscopy has been used to study bone diseases in historical populations, and the work has been published in the Journal of Archaeological Science. The results of the Raman study confirmed that the abnormally shaped bones did have chemical abnormalities. The bones of sailors, as well as a dog called Hatch, and artefacts from the wreckage, were raised from the Solent (marked) in October 1982 . The 16th-century warship Mary Rose (illustrated sinking in 1545) underwent a meticulous programme of conservation after being lifted from the seabed in October 1982. For decades after the hull of Henry VIII's flagship was raised, it was sprayed with millions of litres of water and wax chemicals to preserve it . The 16th-century warship Mary Rose underwent a meticulous programme of conservation after being lifted from the seabed more than 30 years ago. For decades after the hull of Henry VIII's flagship was raised in October 1982, it was constantly sprayed with millions of litres of water and wax chemicals to preserve it. At first, the hull was sprayed with recycled, fresh water at a temperature of less than 5°C (41°F) to stop the wood drying out and to inhibit bacterial activity. The hull had been preserved under the sea as it had been embedded in mud preventing bacteria and tides from eroding it. In 1985, the ship was turned upright and titanium props were installed to support the internal structure and work was undertaken to remove as much sediment as possible. In 1985, the ship (pictured) was turned upright and titanium props were installed to support the internal structure and work was undertaken to remove as much sediment as possible. Once drying is complete in 2017, the internal walls surrounding the hull will be removed and visitors will see an unobstructed view . The Mary Rose Museum (pictured) has worked closely with the team behind the Swedish warship Vasa which has used a similar highly-sophisticated drying process . From 1994, active conservation commenced with the spraying of Polyethylene Glycol (Peg), a water-soluble polymer which can penetrate deep into the wood and support the cell walls. And last year, on April 29, the Peg sprays were turned off and the hull began its final air-drying phase to remove 100 tonnes of water during the next four to five years. Visitors to the Mary Rose Museum in Portsmouth's Historic Dockyard will be able to view the hull through windows into the airtight chamber as it undergoes this final stage of conservation. The Mary Rose Museum has worked closely with the team behind the Swedish warship Vasa which has used a similar highly-sophisticated drying process. Once drying is complete in 2017, the internal walls surrounding the hull will be removed and visitors will be able to see a completely unobstructed view of the hull. Mark Jones, head of conservation at the Mary Rose Trust, said: 'The conservation of Henry VIII's warship Mary Rose has been one of the largest and most complex programmes of this type ever undertaken. 'It really will be a unique chance for visitors to see our dedicated team preserve such a treasured artefact as they can see through windows into the 'hotbox' containing the Mary Rose when the new museum opens.' Rickets in adults is known as osteomalacia or soft bones, and the most common cause is a lack of vitamin D and calcium. This causes bones to deform, and legs to bow (pictured). In rare cases, children can be born with a genetic form of rickets . Last year, a team of experts used the skull of one of the sailors (left) to reconstruct the face of one of Henry VIII’s archers (right) who died on the ship. They believe he was an archer because his skeleton shows evidence of repetitive stress injuries from pulling a longbow. They also believe that he was of high rank . And it is believed these abnormalities were caused by rickets, brought on by the poor diet of the average person during the 1500s. Rickets in adults is known as osteomalacia or soft bones, and the most common cause is a lack of vitamin D and calcium. This causes bones to deform, and legs to bow. In rare cases, children can be born with a genetic form of rickets. It can also develop if another condition affects how vitamins and minerals are absorbed by the body. Raman is a non-destructive laser technology that uses beams of laser light to see changes in chemical composition across the bones. It scatters light over a sample to track changes in colour. As the light hits the sample during the scattering process, it loses part of its energy to the material, which causes some of the atoms to vibrate. By studying the vibration of the atoms, experts can discover the chemical composition and other useful information about the material. The Raman effect is weak, and only one part in 10 million of the scattered light has a shifted colour. This is too weak to see with the naked eye, so it is analysed using a spectrometer. The process is named after Indian physicist C.V. Raman. He was awarded the 1930 physics Nobel Prize for the discovery. Dr. Jemma Kerns, Raman Clinical Study Manager at University College London and RNOH said: ‘This is the first time that this laser technology has been used to study bone disease in archaeological human bone. ‘We have identified chemical changes in the bones, without damaging them. ‘There is strong evidence to suggest that many of the sailors had suffered from childhood rickets and we hope to apply the Raman technique to the study of modern day rickets.’ Alex Hildred, curator of human remains at the Mary Rose Trust added: ‘The Mary Rose Trust has the responsibility for the remains of over 179 individuals who perished with the ship. ‘The human remains have potential to make a contribution to the public through research, education, display and interpretation. ‘Their use to confirm the presence and prevalence of metabolic bone disease in the 16th century is one of these contributions.’ The Raman study, led by Professor Allen Goodship, was funded as part of a £1.7 million grant from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council. Earlier this year, analysis of dog bones found on the ship revealed that the animal - dubbed Hatch - was a male, possibly a Jack Russell and had a dark brown coat. Last year, a team of experts from Swansea University used the skull of one of the sailors to reconstruct the face of one of Henry VIII’s archers who died on the ship.

"It showcases a much more modern style than Downton Abbey fans are used to – at least on the inside. But there is no denying the aristocratic glamour of Highclere Castle’s new guest lodge. For the first time in its 221-year history, the sprawling estate where the ITV series is filmed is offering guests the chance to stay the night in London Lodge, the castle’s Georgian Grade II-listed gatehouse. Scroll down for video . Visitors to HIghclere Castle in Hampshire, where hit ITV series Downton Abbey is filmed, will soon be able to stay in the estate’s Georgian Grade II-listed gatehouse . The gatehouse features two separate lodges, which are situated either side of the property’s heavy iron gates, and which each accommodate two guests. With prices starting from £350 ($547) a night, it is being billed as the perfect getaway for Downton Abbey fans wanting to sample first-hand the sumptuous aristocratic lifestyle depicted in the hit drama. The lodge, is situated at the top of the mile-long driveway which leads to the stately home which has become familiar to millions of ITV viewers. The accommodation is self-catering and will be available to rent during the spring and summer when Highclere Castle is open to the public.

The gatehouse features two separate lodges, which are situated either side of the property’s heavy iron gates, and which each accommodate two guests . Highclere’s owners, the Earl and Countess of Carnarvon, have spent two years restoring the gatehouse which was built by the first Earl of Carnarvon in 1793. It has been left disused for decades, but will now be open from Valentine’s Day next year. London Lodge is situated to the north of the estate, with paths and tracks taking guests back through the parkland towards Dunsmere Lake, The Temple of Diana and expansive views of the Castle. The interiors has been ‘sympathetically restored’ and feature wood burning stoves, fully equipped kitchens, double bedrooms, a bathroom and dressing area. Highclere Castle offers visitors the chance to have weddings at the 5,000 acre estate for £15,000 . Lady Carnarvon recently said: ‘It’s a new step for me. We will welcome people from all over, I expect. Access is going to depend on the time of year. It will be cosy, charming and unique. ‘It’s exciting bringing back to life an old, sad building and again giving it purpose. It is a new departure for us to try short lets and we hope it will amuse people. ‘I hope to suggest some walks around various paths in the estate as well as suggesting local pubs.’ The castle is already immensely popular with visitors, particularly Americans, many of whom visit Britain specially to take in the stunning grounds. A new step: Lady Carnarvon has opened the doors to the Highclere gatehouse left disused for decades . Currently there is a long waiting list to marry there, with each wedding earning the estate £15,000 ($23,454). Lady Carnarvon and her husband Geordie were burdened by the high expense of running a stately home before their friend Julian Fellowes wrote the series, with Highclere in mind, for ITV in 2010. Reports at the time suggested £1.8million ($2.8million) of urgent repairs were needed to keep Highclere going after it had been ravaged by damp and rot. At least 50 rooms were uninhabitable and its stone turrets were falling into disrepair. Lady Carnarvon added: ‘Downton has helped our marketing in an extraordinary way and has meant we have been able to tackle various projects earlier than otherwise because of the increased tours and visitors. And I suspect the effects from Downton will still roll out over the next 20 years.’","Guests will soon able to stay the night during the Spring and Summer .

"The collapse of the Easter Island's civilisation is often used as a cautionary tale to show the folly of humans who overexploit their surroundings, but scientists have now discovered what allowed the ancient inhabitants to flourish in the first place. Tiny plant fossils preserved in the dental plaque on teeth found among human remains on the remote Pacific island have revealed what the doomed civilisation ate - sweet potato. Scientists found starch grains from the popular tuber embedded in the hardened plaque from a selection of teeth from inhabitants of the island between the 14th and end of the 19th century. Microfossils embedded in the dental plaque of ancient human teeth show early inhabitants of Easter Island ate a diet dominated by starch from sweet potato . They claim that the starchy, sweet tasting vegetable formed the predominant part of the islander's diet and was also a major source of water for them. They believe the original Polynesian settlers brought the vegetable with them when they first arrived on Easter Island, or Rapa Nui as it is also known, sometime before the 1200 AD. Despite living on a remote dot of land in the middle of the Pacific Ocean with only their enigmatic stone figures for company, the ancient Polynesian people who populated Easter Island may not have been as isolated as has long been believed. A recent genetic study published in the journal Current Biology found that these ancient people had significant contact with Native American populations hundreds of years before Dutch explorers first reached the island in 1722. Genetic data on 27 Easter Island natives indicated that interbreeding between the Rapa Nui and native people in South America occurred roughly between 1300 and 1500. The genetic evidence indicates either that Rapa Nui people traveled to South America or that Native Americans journeyed to Easter Island. The researchers said it probably was the Rapa Nuipeople making the arduous ocean round trips. 'We found evidence of gene flow between this population and . Native American populations, suggesting an ancient ocean . migration route between Polynesia and the Americas,' said . geneticist Anna-Sapfo Malaspinas of the Centre for GeoGenetics . at the University of Copenhagen, who led the study. However, the study may also help to explain what led to the ultimate downfall of the civilisation that once flourished on Easter Island. It is thought that the flourishing Rapa Nui civilisation, which numbered more than 15,000 at its peak, destroyed the trees that covered the island, leading to wars over dwindling resources. Grains of silica from the palm trees that were once common over the island were found in the dental plaque of the ancient inhabitants, leading to claims that they had used them for food. However, the latest research shows no sign of starch from palm trees on the teeth and that the palm fossils can actually become incorporated into the skin of sweet potatoes grown on the same ground. This suggests that as the population grew, the islanders cut down some of the palm forest to create land where they could grow their crops of sweet potatoes. Monica Tromp, an anatomist at the University of Otago in New Zealand who conducted the work, said: 'By about AD 1500 the palm forest that covered most of the island was eradicated. 'The historic and modern aspect of the landscape is one of low-lying grasses, sedges and invasive shrubs, leaving no visible evidence of the extinct palm thought to have been dominant. 'The consistency of microfossils recovered from the dental calculus suggest that the plant component of the Rapa Nui diet probably did not change much through time. 'This would be expected as cultivation strategies of the sweet potato crops in the marginal Rapa Nui environment were refined over time. 'Sweet potato does not require processing or cooking before eating, and indeed was probably eaten raw as a source of both carbohydrates and water.' Easter Island is one of the most remote inhabited island in the world, more than 2,180 miles away from the coast of Chile and 1,289 miles from the nearest inhabited island. Cultivation of sweet potato  may have given the inhabitants on Easter Island time to carve the distinctive stone moai heads that are the only visible signs left on the landscape of the once flourishing civilisation . Human teeth found at archaeological sites around the coast of Easter Island were studied by the scientists . Yet it is thought that shortly before 1200 AD, Polynesians sailed to the island and began to settle there, although some experts put the arrival of the first settlers as early as 800 AD. The population on the island grew quickly as settlements were formed, thriving for hundreds of years. Some experts believe the fertile land allowed the population time to develop a rich culture and gave them time to carve the distinctive moai stone heads that the island is now famous for. However, the destruction of the palm forests that covered the island led to much of the fertile soil washing away while the introduction of pests like the Pacific rat also damaged the natural wildlife. It was thought that the trees were cut down to provide fuel and building material for the inhabitants. But the latest findings, which are published in the Journal of Archaeological Science, suggest that they may have also been removed to make room for agricultural land for growing sweet potato. By the time the first European explorers discovered the island in 1722, the population had dropped from around 15,000 to between 2,000 and 3,000 and the land was almost barren. Starvation and war over the remaining resources are thought to have devastated the once stable civilisation and led to some of the famous stone heads being toppled. Grains of starch from sweet potato were found in the ancient dental plaque of teeth found on Easter Island . Easter Island now boasts a population of around 5,000 but by the time the second expedition of European explorers arrived at the island in 1877, its population had almost completely died out . Disease and slave raiding during the 19th century further reduced the population of the island to just over 100 by 1877. Miss Tromp and her colleague Dr John Dudgeon from Idaho State University, studied 30 human teeth from the remains of 26 individuals found at archaeological sites around the island. Embedded within the hardened dental plaque, also called dental calculus, were microscopic fossils from plants. Initial work looking at these found the vast majority were microfossils, or phytoliths, from a species of palm tree (Paschalococos disperta) that went extinct shortly after the Polynesian's arrival. However, further analysis also found starch grains that matched those from modern sweet potatoes. The researchers also tested modern sweet potatoes grown in sediment similar to that of Easter Island and found that as the tubers grow, their skins incorporate palm phyotliths from the soil. Miss Tromp said that it seemed likely that the sweet potatoes were brought to Easter Island by the first Polynesian settlers. She said: 'The sweet potato starch grains were found on almost all of the teeth we looked at and so we think this is evidence that they had the sweet potato with them when the Polynesian settlers colonised the Island. It was not indigenous. 'We found palm phytoliths in a much larger quantity than the starch grains, which does support that there was once a large quantity of palm trees on Easter Island in the past. 'Phytoliths are usually found in every part of palm trees and so when they die their phytoliths are left behind in the soil indefinitely. 'This does not necessarily mean that our research supports the conclusion that they were destroyed by humans - although there is other research that does support that conclusion.' The scientists found that microfossils from palm trees can become incorporated into the skins of sweet potato, suggesting that the vegetables were grown in soil that had been cleared of palm trees . Dr Dudgeon, an anthropologist at Idaho State University who led the work, said that the team were now analysing DNA recovered from the dental plaque to see if they can identify animal proteins. They have also been able to recover some plant chloroplast DNA but have yet to match it to a species. He said that the work may lead to new theories about what led to the demise of the civilisation on Easter Island. He said: 'Rapa Nui is a profound example of human persistence on a very marginal island, and that through selective use of plants and animals - sweet potatoes and Polynesian rats - that were well-adapted to the rather cold, nontropical environment on Rapa Nui they arrived at an adequate solution to exist there until the first documented European arrival on Easter Sunday, 1722. 'Other island populations in the remote eastern Pacific - Rapa Iti - do not persist until European arrival. 'It is my opinion that sweet potatoes are not implicated in the demise of the island’s native palm; rather, the normal and sustained use of the parts of this tree, coupled with the loss of the germinative seeds or nuts of this tree from the Polynesian rat predation is the more likely cause of the trees’ extinction. 'Forest clearance activities may have had some effect on the sheer number of trees on the island, but I am not convinced that agricultural activities are the prime cause of forest extirpation on Rapa Nui.'","Sweet potato was main source of food and water on island scientist find .

"An inspiring British project to land a spacecraft on the moon in 10 years has completed its funding target today. The Lunar Mission One project reached its £600,000 ($938,170) goal on crowdfunding site Kickstarter, with 36 hours to go. For £60 ($94), backers have the opportunity to buy space on memory discs that will be sent to the moon, and, for an undisclosed price, they are able to send a sample of their DNA. Scroll down for video . Ambitious: An inspiring British project to land a spacecraft on the moon in 10 years has completed its funding target today . These discs will act like time capsules for photos, videos and other files, and will be buried in a bore hole drilled into the lunar surface. While the discs have raisede money for the mission, its main aim is to analyse the lunar South Pole and assess its potential for a possible human base to be developed in the future. A probe will also drill 330ft (100 metres) below the surface to look at whether it will be possible to someday have observatories on the moon. Up until now, there have been no missions to the moon's South Pole, which is of particular interest because its home to the largest impact crater on the Moon, the South Pole-Aitken (SPA) basin. Target: The Lunar Mission One project reached its £600,000 ($938,170) goal on crowdfunding site Kickstarter . The SPA has a diameter of 1,550 miles (2,500km) and covers almost a quarter of the moon. Scientists believe remnants from the SPA impact may still be present in this area, and analysis of the material may be used to date the basin. The Lunar Mission One vehicle will be delivered into space by a medium-lift rocket, such as SpaceX's Falcon 9, before embarking on its journey to the moon. Once there, it will carry out a descent sequence to the lunar surface, with four engines ensuring it lands gently  within a pre-determined landing site the size of a football stadium. Moon dust: Once on the moon, the spacecraft will drill 100 metres (330 feet) down to collect samples for scientific analysis (illustrated). It will collect samples every six inches (15cm), which will be scooped up and placed in the spacecraft for scientific analysis to answer questions about the moon . On the surface it will drill to depths of up to 330 feet (100 metres), collecting samples every six inches (15cm) for analysis on board the spacecraft. It's thought that the top 33ft (10 metres) of rock will be a fine-grained deposit from constant bombardment of meteorites and smaller particles. Further down, though, the moon is thought to be made of rocks that fused together by pressure and heat from asteroid impacts long ago. The deepest samples that have been obtained are from three metres below the surface, by Apollo 17 Astronauts Gene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt in 1972. The company plans to send a robot lander to the South Pole of the moon - an unexplored area. They will drill to a depth of at least 66ft (20 metres) - 10 times deeper than has been drilled before - and potentially up to 330ft (100 metres). The hole will be two inches (5cm) in diameter, and it will take the lander one hour to drill each six inches (15cm). Core samples will taken from each six inches. It will then study lunar rock from this depth that is 4.5 billion years old, and has remain untouched underground. It's thought the top 33 feet (10 metres) or so of rock will be a fine-grained deposit from constant bombardment of meteorites and smaller particles.

British engineer and city financier David Iron, who came up with the plan said: 'People can put any information they like in the memory disc; it will be like a personal time capsule, a private archive. It could be a small message saying ""hi, I'm Joe"" or a whole family history.' Professor Ian Crawford, who is one of Lunar Mission One's scientific advisers, said that despite more than 50 expeditions to the moon, far more needs to be done to understand our satellite. 'Until recently the European Space Agency had plans for a lunar lander (which has since been scrapped) and the science case for Lunar Mission One is quite similar,' he told BBC News.

"There’s nothing worse than forgetting where you’ve parked your car in a multi-storey car park. But soon you won’t even need to climb the stairs to another floor, as BMW has announced a new feature that can park itself and return to you at the touch of a button. When a voice command is spoken into a smartwatch, the car will leave its space and drive to the exit, calculating the time it will take so that it arrives just as you get there. Munich-based BMW has unveiled technology that can park your car. It uses four lasers on the car to create a virtual map of the car park. When arriving the driver instructs the car to go park using a smartwatch (shown) The new technology, known as the Remote Valet Parking Assistant, is being tested on Munich-based BMW’s i3 vehicle. Instead of GPS, the technology uses four laser scanners on the car, which create a virtual map of the building, to navigate. Yesterday it was revealed that Jaguar is planning see-through car pillars to eradicate the blind spot. It uses cameras to make the pillars 'transparent' when the driver looks towards them and give them 360 degree vision. The cameras are fitted to the outside frame of the car to provide a live feed onto screens on the pillars inside the car. This essentially makes them see-through, with the feed kicking in the moment the driver indicates, moves their head over their shoulder or approaches a junction. It is hoped the technology, which is still in concept form, could reduce the potential for accidents. When arriving at the car park, the driver need only get out of the vehicle and activate the feature. The car will then recognise the structural features of the car park, and ‘equally reliably steers round any obstaces that appear unexpectedly - such as incorrectly parked vehicles,’ according to BMW. According to its makers, it can even look for a parking spot and recognise which ones are empty. The company hasn’t said what would happen if it doesn’t manage to find one, though, such in a busy car park in London or New York. The technology is being developed alongside other new features such as 360-degree collision avoidance. This uses the laser scanners to record the environment and identify obstacles such as columns or walls. The car will automatically find an empty space and lock itself there (shown). To park it doesn't require any additional infrastructure, so existing structures can be used . If the system detects a collision is imminent, it brakes automatically. BMW also says the use of lasers over GPS is better, as the latter is ‘not at all precise’ in multi-storey car parks. The system does not require specially designed car parks; it can work in any pre-existing car park without any additional infrastructure. However, the company has not yet announced when the feature will be available in any of its cars on sale. When the driver comes back they speak into the watch again to be picked up (shown). BMW says it is more precise than existing GPS systems. They have also revealed a 360-degree collision avoidance system .","Munich-based BMW has unveiled technology that can park your car .

"It has often been said that one of the reasons we are yet to find life elsewhere in the universe is that it is rare; most think the development of life on Earth was a fluke. But one of the most prominent young physicists in the world has claimed otherwise, saying that he thinks life is as inevitable as inorganic matter. The bold new theory suggests that atoms, when subjected to energy, will always form some form of life - and it may mean we are part of a universe teeming with other organisms. A Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientist says life in the universe (stock image shown) may be common. Dr Jeremy England's theory suggests atoms will always pick an organic path. This is because they are choosing the path that requires least energy - and life is more efficient than inorganic matter . The theory has been presented by 31-year-old physicist Dr Jeremy England from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He is regarded as one of the most promising up and coming scientists in biology; a few years ago he was named in the Forbes Rising Stars of Science list. And now in a series of talks he has been giving to various universities, he says the origin of life ‘should be as unsurprising as rocks rolling downhill,’ reported Business Insider. He has recently published a paper further explaining the research along with two of his colleagues. Dr Susah Schneider, an Associate Professor in Philosophy at the University of Connecticut, said earlier this month that the first life we find in the universe might be a form of artificial intelligence - and it could indicate that humans, too, will one day be more machine than man. Speaking to MailOnline, she said: ‘If you look at our own civilisation, people are becoming more immersed in computers, and we can already see signs of it in our own culture. ‘So it looks like the next evolutionary step could be we are post-biological, we are sort of part computer in that people decide to “upload” themselves. ‘It sounds kind of crazy, and I don’t approve of this as a philosopher, but I think the thing is that that’s sort of the pattern a lot of people are starting to notice. ‘Aliens will be vastly older than us, so it looks like they may be sophisticated forms of AI that are far smarter than we are.' Dr England’s idea is based around entropy; namely, energy spreads out or dissipates over time. For example, a cup of coffee left in a room will eventually reach the same temperature as the room itself. Energy will always seek the path of least resistance if left to its own devices, which is why things in the universe - including the universe itself - tend to ‘spread out',  also known as an increase in entropy. Based on this, Dr England suggests that when atoms are supplied with energy, in certain conditions they will always eventually give rise to life. ‘You start with a random clump of atoms, and if you shine light on it for long enough, it should not be so surprising that you get a plant,’ he said. The reason for this, and the underlying aspect of his theory, is that while all matter - from rocks to plants - absorbs and dissipates energy, life is much better at redistributing it. This means that, taking the coffee cup example but this time using molecules swimming in an ocean, the atoms will reorganise themselves into life because it is better at dissipating the energy in the water. Dr England's theory implies that as energy spreads out - entropy - life is inevitable. Atoms in a primordial ocean (illustrated), for example, should ultimately form into organic matter if supplied with energy. The origin of life 'should be as unsurprising as rocks rolling downhill,' he said . Dr England stressed that his theory is not meant to counter Darwin’s theory of evolution, natural selection, but rather compliment it. ‘The reason that an organism shows characteristic X rather than Y may not be because X is more fit than Y, but because physical constraints make it easier for X to evolve than for Y to evolve,’ he said. And in his latest research he said he has carried out a study, with his colleagues, that shows the theory could well be true. ‘We are [...] spurred on by the intriguing possibility that life-like behavior in nonequilibrium systems may turn out to be surprisingly common, now that we have begun learning how to look for its physical signatures,' they wrote. If true, the implications of Dr England’s theories are vast. Perhaps most importantly, it may suggest life elsewhere in the universe is not as rare as once thought, but rather is as common as planets and stars themselves. While many think that life in the universe is rare, it may instead be that we are just a tiny speck in the amount of life in the universe. In the last few decades hundreds of exoplanets have been discovered (illustration shown), although we are yet to find one that could truly be classed as 'habitable' like Earth . Speaking to MailOnline, Dr Seth Shostak, Director of the Centre for Seti Research, said: ‘One of the outstanding problems in science these days is the origin of life. The Fermi Paradox questions why have we not found aliens, despite the existence of hundreds of billions of exosolar systems in our galactic neighborhood in which life might evolve. Physicist Enrico Fermi devised it in 1950. He believed it was too extraordinary that not a single extraterrestrial signal or engineering project has yet been detected. He claimed there must be some kind of barrier that prevents the rise of intelligent, self-aware, technologically advanced, space-colonising civilisations. We can think of this barrier as a ‘Great Filter’. The absence could be caused because either intelligent life is extremely rare or intelligent life has a tendency to go extinct. ‘We know that Earth has been [host to life] for close to four billion years, but what we don’t know is how that first self-reproducing bit of chemistry got started.’ He explained that if getting life started required very special conditions, then it would ‘imply that we don’t have much company in the cosmos.’ He continued: 'If Dr England is correct - that biology is virtually a certain consequence of self-organising principles that would apply on any world - then we are most certainly not alone. 'Remember that Fred Hoyle, the famous British cosmologist, once opined that the probability that the random mixing of molecules in the primordial oceans of Earth would eventually produce DNA or RNA was about the same as the chance that a tornado, tearing through a junkyard, would assemble a Boeing 707. ‘In that view, life would be extraordinarily special and rare. Dr. England suggests, however, that nothing could be farther from the truth.’","Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientist says life may be common .

"Tattooing or piercing your pet will become a crime in New York after new laws were introduced to ban the 'cruel' practice. While people can choose the pain of tattoos or piercings to satisfy their own 'aesthetic predilections,' companion animals don't have that luxury said Assembly member Linda Rosenthal, who sponsored the legislation. 'It's simply cruel,' added the Manhattan Democrat, after the law was signed in Monday by governor Andrew Cuomo. It will take effect in 120 days. The new laws were introduced after this picture of a Pit-bull mix called Zion was posted on Instagram by Brooklyn artist Alexander Avgerakis under the moniker 'Mistah Metro'.  Assembly member Linda Rosenthal, who sponsored the legislation called animal tattoos 'cruel' 'This is animal abuse, pure and simple,' Cuomo said after inking in the new law which will see penalties for violations range up to 15 days in jail and fines of up to $250, according to staff at his office. Rosenthal's chief of staff Lauren Schuster said support grew this year after a Brooklyn tattoo artist posted a photograph of his tattooed dog online in March. 'My dog is cooler than yours,' bragged Alexander Avgerakis, who uses the moniker 'Mistah Metro', when he posted a picture of his poor pit-bull mix, called Zion, on his Instagram account. 'She had her spleen removed yesterday, and the vet let me tattoo her while she was under (anaesthetic),' he wrote next to the image of his zonked out pooch, which has since been deleted. Inked onto a shaven area on the dog's shoulder, the heart tattoo was inked with the names Alex and Mel. At the time, a spokesman for the American Veterinary Medical Association said they had policies against tattoos because, 'it's not good for the dog.' Those views were backed up by Teresa Chagrin, an animal care and control specialist for People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) who said that tattoos caused pain to the animals. Tattooing and piercing animals violates existing laws against animal cruelty in all 50 states, she said, adding that it wasn't immediately aware if other states that clarified their laws like New York did. After posting the picture, Avgerakis explained his dog had just had to have her spleen removed and was still under anaesthetic when the tattoo was done. But the American Veterinary Medical Association said they had policies against tattoos because, 'it's not good for the dog' Avgerakis later removed the post. Anyone attempting to tattoo or pierce their dog in New York will face penalties which range up to 15 days in jail and fines of up to $250, according to staff at governor Andrew Cuomo's office . However, Schuster said she thought Pennsylvania was the first state to introduce similar laws, following the 2011 case of a woman who was piercing kittens and selling them on the internet as 'gothic. Similar legislation was introduced this summer in New Jersey. The New York law will however, exempt markings done under a veterinarian's supervision for a medical reason or identification. Rosenthal said that's intended, for example, for pets like her cat, which was spayed by a vet and given a little green mark to indicate that. Any identification tattoos should include only numbers and letters allotted for a tattoo identification registry. The law also does not apply to ear tags on rabbits and guinea pigs.","Support for the new law grew after image of tattoo on pet's shoulder .

"Champagne and gin have overtaken sherry and brandy as our preferred tipples at Christmas, a study suggests. Researchers analysed conversations of today and compared them with those of the 1990s, to reveal how our food and drink preferences have changed. They looked at thousands of recorded exchanges from the 1990s which showed we would rather pep up our festivities with champagne, gin or vodka than sherry and liqueur. Champagne, gin and vodka have replaced sherry and brandy as our favourite drinks at Christmas time . It showed  that we are also less likely to make traditional Christmas food like Yorkshire puddings. According to recent records, we have resorted to ordering takeout curry and pizza rather than making festive holiday dinner favourites like custard. And it won't surprise you that compared to the 1990s, we talk about calories twice as much as we used to. Words don't necessarily always translate to actions as our most talked about food item at Christmas - as well as the rest of the year - is cake. The study also found that we have resorted to ordering takeout curry and pizza rather than making festive holiday dinner favourites like custard . Initial findings from the study revealed tea is our nation's favourite drink, spoken an average of 255 times per million words. Yet when it comes to choosing between a cup of coffee and a glass of wine, alcohol is more important to us Brits. The nation's favourite drink is tea, and was spoken an average of 255 times per million words . The study shows we talk about family almost twice as much as we used to, as it seems that the concept of family is more noticeable in British English speech today than it was two decades ago. Dr Claire Dembry, Senior Language Research Manager at Cambridge University Press, said: 'This analysis presents an interesting insight into how our use of language has changed over time. 'Our tastes in food and drink have certainly changed, but our interest in the family seems to be ever increasing. 'Coupled with the finding that we are also significantly less self-centred in our speech than we used to be, with a reduction in frequency of words associated with self - we say ""I"" or ""me"" 47 per cent less than we used to . 'This suggests Christmas may be even happier this year - but perhaps this can be attributed to all the talk of champagne!' The team at the University of Lancaster are looking for people to send in their everyday conversations for a fee to aid the study further. Professor Tony McEnery, from the ESRC Centre for Corpus Approaches to Social Sciences (CASS) at Lancaster University, said: 'We need to gather hundreds, if not thousands, of conversations to create a full spoken corpus, so we can continue to analyse the way language has changed over the last 20 years. 'This is an ambitious project and we are calling for people to send us MP3 files of their everyday, informal conversations in exchange for a small payment to help our team to delve deeper into spoken language and to shed more light on the way our spoken language changes over time.'","Researchers analysed conversations of today compared with the 1990s .

"A fascinating 2,800-year-old  farmhouse has been unearthed during an archaeological dig near Tel Aviv, Israel. The large, 23-room home, which covers a 100ft x 130ft area, was built in the eighth century BC, around the time of the Assyrian conquest of Israel. The site is thought to have a rich history, with Greek coins found in the house suggesting that the farmhouse was occupied by different empires over the course of hundreds of years. A 2,800-year-old farmhouse, which was used by both the Assyrians and the Greeks, has been unearthed during an archaeological dig near Tel Aviv, Israel . The remains of the building were found by the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) in Rosh HaAyin, east of Tel Aviv. Numerous presses were discovered in the vicinity, suggesting that Israelis and Greeks who lived there over the years used the farm to make their own wine to sell. Amit Shadman, the IAA's excavation director, told the Jerusalem Post that the building was constructed around 740BC, during the time of the Assyrian conquest. 'Farm houses during this period served as small settlements of sorts, whose inhabitants participated in processing agricultural produce,' he explained. The numerous wine presses discovered in the vicinity of the settlement indicate the wine industry was the most important branch of agriculture in the region. 'A large silo, which was used to store grain, shows that the ancient residents were also engaged in growing cereal,' Mr Shadman added. On one side of the Greek coins found in the farmhouse is an image of god of the gods Zeus (right), with Heracles (left) appearing on the other side. The archaeologist said that the building continued to be used during the Persian period, also known as the Time of the Return to Zion, in the sixth century BC. It was also used by the Greeks when Alexander the Great arrived in Israel in the fourth century BC. The rare, silver Greek coins found on one of the floors of the building bear Alexander's name. On one side of the coin is an image of Greek god of the gods Zeus, with Heracles appearing on the other side. 'With Alexander's victory over the Persian army in 333BC, he embarked upon numerous successful military campaigns,' Mr Shadman said. 'His campaign in Israel did not encounter any special difficulties and the country opened its gates to the great warrior. 'In light of this impressive building's excellent state of preservation, the Israel Antiquities Authority and Ministry of Construction decided to conserve the structure in situ for the benefit of the city's residents and the visiting public.'","Fascinating 2,800-year-old farmhouse is unearthed during archaeological dig near Tel Aviv, Israel .

"A so-called early version of the Mona Lisa has gone on public display for the first time in 400 years - as experts revealed they have established a link between it and one of England's finest country homes. A group of historians claim Leonardo da Vinci painted the work, dubbed the 'Early Mona Lisa', more than a decade before his masterpiece portrait and depicted the same Italian merchant's wife. It was unearthed before the First World War but lay hidden in a Swiss bank vault for 40 years, while a consortium carried out secret tests before unveiling it in 2012 - though  many experts still insist it was one of a litany of inferior copies. Scroll down for video . Spot the difference: A so-called early version (left) of the Mona Lisa has gone on display for the first time, two years after being unveiled by a team of historians who claimed it depicted the same Italian merchant's wife a decade before the version which hangs in the Louvre (right) Detail: The Swiss-based Mona Lisa Foundation claims both works depict the Florentine merchant's wife Lisa del Giacondo . Today, as the painting's first public exhibition was unveiled in Singapore, the Swiss-based Mona Lisa Foundation claimed it has discovered new details about the painting's past which strengthen the view  it is by Da Vinci. It was already known that it was bought from a Somerset aristocrat in 1913 by English art dealer Hugh Blaker, who kept it in his studio in Isleworth, south west London, before selling it to American   Henry Pulitzer in the 1960s. Before that, however, the painting's journey was a murky one. Now the Foundation claims it has identified strong evidence that the Somerset  home where the painting was bought in 1913 could be Montacute House - one of England's finest Elizabethan mansions now run by the National Trust. The claim, seen by the Reuters news agency, would fit if true. The Phelips family which owned Montacute fell on hard times and secretly sold their possessions just before the First World War, leaving the manor in 1911. In 1915 the house was taken over by future Foreign Secretary Lord Curzon, and it was later put up for sale in 1929. By 1931 it was so dilapidated that it was being valued ‘for scrap’ at £5,882. Diaries kept by Blaker - who tried several times unsuccessfully to have the painting authenticated - were lost, but the researchers say the brief references which remain to the house indicate it was Montacute. Illustrious history: According to the Reuters news agency, the researchers have linked the painting for the first time to Montacute House, a grand Renaissance manor in Somerset now run by the National Trust. Its owners fell on hard times just before the work emerged in 1913 . Grand: Appropriately enough, the manor - used to film Sense and Sensibility - now houses 60 works on loan from the National Portrait Gallery . Now that the house has been restored, it was used as a filming location for the 1995 version of Sense and Sensibility starring Emma Thompson and Hugh Grant, and its Long Gallery houses more than 60 Tudor and Elizabethan portraits on loan from the National Portrait Gallery in London. The Mona Lisa researchers also say they have traced the portrait's history before its possible arrival at Montacute. In a communication passed to Reuters, they said they had found references to a painting called La Joconde - the French name for the Mona Lisa - in an art . exhibition in Yeovil, Somerset, in 1856. The painting, which was sold to a silver . dealer two years later, also featured in a document declaring that young Somerset noble James Marwood owned a work by Da Vinci called La Joconde, which he probably bought on a visit to Italy around the 1780s. Geneva-based auctioneer David Feldman, the Foundation's vice president, said: 'We feel these latest discoveries and new scientific . analysis just carried out leave little doubt that it is Da Vinci's work. 'The vast majority of experts now either agree with us or . accept that there is a strong case for our thesis'. Gallery: A visitor compares the two at the world premiere exhibition of the so-called early work, which was unveiled today in Singapore . Detail: The 'early work' (pictured in Singapore) has undergone X-rays and ultraviolet light tests, and been compared to Da Vinci's geometry . The painting is claimed to show a younger Lisa del Giacondo, the Florentine merchant's wife who is the subject of the slightly smaller Mona Lisa painting which now hangs in the Louvre in Paris. The Mona Lisa Foundation says it was probably left unfinished by Da Vinci in 1505, before being completed and handed to Lisa's husband the following year. That would make it more than a decade older than the better-known Mona Lisa, which was unveiled in 1517 before passing into the hands of the French royal family and, later, international legend. The alleged earlier painting has been subject to X-rays and ultraviolet light scans to establish its age, and has been compared to Da Vinci's techniques - including his use of geometry in his famous Vitruvian Man sketch of 1490. They  say it lacked a specific glazing technique which Da Vinci developed in 1508, and which was used in most of his paintings after that date. It has earned the seal of approval, at least partially, from modern  experts including Renaissance historian Giorgio Vasari, art historian John Eyre, research physicist Professor John Asmus and Professor Alessandro Vezzosi, one of the most influential living experts on Da Vinci. Reputation: The Mona Lisa (right in 2005) was painted by Italian master Leonardo da Vinci (left) and is now the world's most famous portrait . Tourist attraction: Visitors strain their eyes to see the real Mona Lisa - which has been stolen and defaced in the past - through Louvre security . Not everyone is convinced the painting is a real work by the Italian master. There were several contemporary copies of the Mona Lisa, and historians have often suggested the so-called early version is just another one. And although the Swiss-based Mona Lisa Foundation is described as being not for profit, its entire aim is to study the painting - which is now owned by an anonymous 'consortium', so it is difficult to establish who would benefit financially if it was declared a genuine Da Vinci. One of the leading doubters of the painting's authenticity in 2012 was Oxford University art history professor Martin Kemp, who was instrumental in identifying a major work by Leonardo Da Vinci in 2010. Although he had not personally seen the painting - also known as the Isleworth Mona Lisa after Blaker's studio - he said two years ago: 'The Isleworth Mona Lisa mistranslates subtle details of the original, including the sitter's veil, her hair, the translucent layer of her dress, the structure of the hands. 'The landscape is devoid of atmospheric subtlety. The head, like all other copies, does not capture the profound elusiveness of the original.' He also said the Isleworth version was painted on canvas, and Da Vinci's preferred choice was wood.","'Early Mona Lisa' on  display for first time since 2012 unveiling after it lay hidden in Swiss bank vault for 40 years .

"She is a fashion designer, charity ambassador and mother-of-four. But despite her hectic schedule, Victoria Beckham always manages to look immaculate. So what's her secret? Regular oxygen facials, workouts nearly every day and plenty of fish, explains the svelte star. Victoria has revealed that she keeps her skin in check with the help of products and techniques created by dermatologist Dr Harold Lancer - who also advises Kim Kardashian West on how to care for her skin. Clean living: Victoria Beckham, 40, has shared the secrets behind her healthy lifestyle and reveals she works out seven times a week, has oxygen facials and follows a 'very healthy' diet . Her favourite treatment performed by the skincare guru is a unique facial he devised to boost the oxygenation and blood flow to the skin cells. The facial uses molecular oxygen and vitamins to detoxify tissues, unblock pores and tighten the skin. When asked by the ELLE US website about her skincare regime, Victoria said: 'I swear by Dr Lancer products. He's a dermatologist that I met in Los Angeles. I started going to him for oxygen facials, and I haven't looked back. 'I don't really use products other than his. I keep it quite simple with a really good polish, then an exfoliating cleanse, then I use a nourish cream, which is a really beautiful moisturiser.' Dr Lancer shared the skincare secrets and lifestyle tips that he passes onto his A-list clients, such as Kim and Victoria, with FEMAIL. 'I prescribe the Lancer Three-Step Method - step one, polish; step two, cleanse; step three, nourish - to all of my patients, regardless of how sophisticated they are about cosmetics,' he said. Busy bee: Victoria, who recently won Brand of the Year, explained that she tries to drink lots of water each day and get as much rest as possible, but admits that's hard because she's shares her house with her husband David Beckham and their four children - Brooklyn, 15, Romeo, 12, Cruz, nine, and Harper, three . Dr Lancer says his method differs from traditional skincare because it shifts the focus from the dermis (the lower layer of the skin) to the epidermis (the outermost layer). The Lancer Method reverses the usual order of skin care - beginning with polishing, or exfoliation, followed by cleansing, and then nourishing. He believes that by polishing first, the result is a deeper cleanse, a more efficient delivery of active ingredients and more robust cell renewal. 'Say, for example, you wanted to replace a tile floor. If your epidermis is the floor, then exfoliation is the gentle lifting process that breaks up the old, worn out tiles. Next you have to scoop up and sweep away the debris, e.g. cleansing, and finally fresh tiles have to be laid, which represent the nourish step,' he said. Glow giver: Dr Harold Lancer is Hollywood's favourite dermatologist and the secret behind Kim Kardashian's flawless complexion. The skincare guru has shared his tips for getting glowing skin with MailOnline . 'Exfoliation creates a ""controlled injury"",' he explains. 'Gentle exfoliation sends a message to the dermis that repair should begin and fresh cells are needed, expediting the turnover of cells in your epidermis. Stila products . Yves Saint Laurent Touche Éclat and #23 Makeup Forever Lip pencil . Anastasia Beverly Hills eyebrow pencil . This Works In Transit Camera Close-Up. 'The controlled injury achieved by exfoliating turns back the clock by re-energising the repair process, giving skin a younger, fresher look.' The next step is cleansing, which, as most people know, helps to get rid of everything that has been loosened up by exfoliating. This is followed by nourish, which delivers anti-oxidants, vitamins and other anti-ageing ingredients to the skin. Kim is an everyday user of Dr Lancer’s three-step Method, as is Victoria Beckham, who also loves his SPF and the Lift Serum Intense. Victoria, . 40, uses the serum, which is described as . 'an elegant serum that utlises plant stem cell technology to speed up . cellular regeneration'.

She added: 'I think it's very important to drink lots of water and get as much sleep as you can. But when you have four children, that's easier said than done.' The 40-year-old  - who has just teamed up with Nails Inc. to create a debut range of limited edition polishes - also insists having a good diet is just as important for the health of your skin as it is to stay in shape.

"Experts predict 2015 will be the year when people forsake gadgets, social networks and other technology in favour of a simpler lifestyle . Having the latest gadget or app has been a status symbol for years, but all that could be about to change. Experts predict 2015 will be the year when people forsake gadgets, social networks and other technology in favour of the simple life. Recent figures have already revealed that certain social networks are losing favour, and now a digital trends report believes we are entering the era of the ‘neo-Luddite’. The prediction was made by London-based communications agency Hotwire in its sixth annual Digital Trends Report. ‘While there are many early adopters out there scrambling around to get their hands on the latest smartwatch or iPhone, there are a group of much cooler kids working out ways to kill tech altogether,’ explained the report. ‘Welcome to the era of the neo-Luddite. They’re here to make sure you switch off.’ One reason given for the decline  is the growing irritation of adverts on apps, sites and other screens. ‘Overall we accept that there is an unspoken contract between us and the web,’ continued the report. ‘We can access content for free, in exchange, brands can make us look at adverts for a bit of time. ‘But there are a growing number of people who want to take that virtual contract, burn it and dance around its ashes. ‘So much so that they will be more than happy to part with a bit of up front capital in exchange for the facility to get rid of adverts from their online experience altogether. ‘Ad blocking, as it’s known, is at an all-time high. What’s more it’s not grumpy 40-something IT managers that are doing this - it’s the youth.’ Neo-Luddite is a slang term used to describe someone who believes that using science and technology has moral and social implications. It is used to describe those who are considered to be anti-technology, or those who dislike or have a difficult time understanding and using modern science and technology.

More than 60 per cent of people already use more than one device and the report believes this will rise as tablets become cheaper and wearables become more widely adopted. ‘The connected car has been touted around for even longer than the dreaded self-ordering fridge,’ continued the report. ‘[And now] we’re now beginning to see real intent from automotive brands, although interestingly the focus isn’t on the connected car, but the content car - one that delivers relevant media throughout your journey.’ Apple’s HealthKit and Google Fit are also said to be bringing digital health to the forefront, and providing the ability to share body data with healthcare professionals. Hotwire believes the more data doctors have, the better, and the next step will be for healthcare systems to be able to handle all this user generated data.

"Education Secretary Nicky Morgan could not spare time to meet a charity planning a series of events to mark the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo . The campaign to mark the anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo has been snubbed by the Education Secretary, it emerged yesterday. Organisers are planning a series of events next year to commemorate Britain’s defeat of Napoleon in 1815 – and have prepared teaching materials for schools. But officials at the Department for Education have responded to a letter from the leaders of Waterloo 200 saying Nicky Morgan had no time to meet them. And the Education Secretary’s aides have also told the Mail that neither she nor any official from the ministry will meet the campaigners. David Huse of Waterloo 200 said: ‘I don’t understand why you wouldn’t want to sit down for half an hour and go through what we want to do. 'It raises the prospect that they’re genuinely not interested in this, one of the most significant events in our history. ‘The battle was a monumental occasion in our history and to involve some schools in what we are doing is a creative way of raising awareness of it. 'I’m very concerned that the Department for Education isn’t engaged in the celebrations for the battle and I would like them more engaged in it.’ Despite not having time to meet the campaigners, Mrs Morgan, who is also minister for women and equalities did manage, in October, to attend the second annual PinkNews Awards, hosted by the gay news service. There she presented an award to a group of university students who posed as ‘naked rowers’ to raise money for anti-bullying causes. Scroll down for video . Since she replaced Michael Gove in the summer, Mrs Morgan has become known as ‘Ms U-turn’ for reversing a number of policies, including scrapping the system of allowing misbehaving children to be punished by making them run around a playing field. Astonished organisers said: 'It raises the prospect that they’re genuinely not interested in this, one of the most significant events in our history' She has also changed her position on gay marriage, saying she is now in favour despite having voted against the idea only last year. Major General Sir Evelyn Webb-Carter, who chairs Waterloo 200, said: ‘I just hope we can find other ways of ensuring that history teachers know what is available.’ Organisers are planning an anniversary concert at the Royal Albert Hall and a commemoration service on June 18 at St Paul’s Cathedral. They have formed a committee of teacher and academics to create resources for teachers and a dedicated website supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund. They wrote to the Department for Education last month, describing their work and requesting a meeting with Mrs Morgan or one of her officials to discuss how they could work together. Reputation: Since she replaced Michael Gove in the summer, Mrs Morgan has become known as ‘Ms U-turn’ for reversing a number of policies . But a civil servant replied on Mrs Morgan’s behalf, saying she was unable to accept because of ‘pressures on her diary’. The letter said she could not agree to all requests. When contacted about the story, a source close to Mrs Morgan said she had not seen the original letter. However, he confirmed she was still not prepared to meet anyone from the campaign. He added: ‘This Government has helped ensured children will learn about Waterloo thanks to our reforms of the national curriculum. The French revolutionary wars – which Waterloo ended – are singled out as one of the topics which 11 to 14-year-olds should cover. ‘Waterloo 200 has already held discussions with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport which is leading on the 200th anniversary.’ Another source said Mrs Morgan’s focus was on ‘getting out of Whitehall’ and ‘visiting schools and hearing from teachers, pupils and parents directly’. Wellington’s victory at Waterloo in alliance with Prussia and the Dutch helped Britain become the world’s pre-eminent power.","Education Secretary's office had no time to meet charity Waterloo 200 .

"No inquest will be held into the death of Michael Payne, father of murdered schoolgirl Sarah Payne, because he died of natural causes, a coroner ruled . The father of murdered schoolgirl Sarah Payne died of natural causes and no inquest will be held into his death, a coroner ruled. Michael Payne had spent more than 10 years struggling with the death of his daughter who was abducted and killed by serial sex offender Roy Whiting in 2000. Mr Payne was found dead at his home in Maidstone in Kent in October in non-suspicious circumstances according to police. The father of four had struggled with an alcohol problem as he attempted to come to terms with the death of eight-year-old Sarah and also split from his wife of 18 years, Sara, in 2003. The office for Patricia Harding, coroner for Mid Kent and Medway, has confirmed that he died from natural causes and an inquest will not be held. Friends said the 45-year-old had spent years 'battling his demons' in the aftermath of his daughter's disappearance and murder. His brother Alan, 47, said 'he was in a downward spiral since it all happened with Sarah' After his death Mr Payne's daughter Charlotte wrote a message saying she was 'heartbroken'. She said: 'No matter what happened and how many mistakes we all made. You will always be my daddy. . Her brother Lee wrote: 'Dad, you had your demons and troubles but you had a good heart and was a decent man!' Mr Payne was found dead at his home after his family contacted police because they had been unable to get hold of him. After his death his father Terrance said: 'After the incident we all went downhill a bit, but we managed to pull ourselves together whereas Michael really struggled. We all knew Mike had demons but it's sad it has come to this.' Scroll down for video . The former airport worker previously said he had felt guilty he had been unable to protect his daughter at this had put a strain on his marriage and eventually led to their divorce. At the time his former wife told the then News of the World: We know we're not the same people we once were - and everyone knows the awful reason why.' Mr Payne had served time in prison after he admitted glassing his brother Stephen in three years ago after a heavy drinking session. Sarah Payne, 8, (left) was abducted and murdered by Roy Whiting after she had been playing at her grandparents house in a cornfield in Kingston Gorse, Sussex. Her mother Sara (right) split from Mr Payne in 2003 saying the stress of their daughter's murder had been a factor in ending their 18 year marriage . Sarah's mother, 45, went on to campaign for a change in legislation to allow parents to know if convicted child sex offenders live nearby, known as Sarah's Law. She has been awarded an MBE and an honorary doctorate for her work. But she suffered a stroke in 2009 which has left her walking with the assistance of a stick. Sarah, of Hersham, Surrey, disappeared on the evening of July 1 2000 from a cornfield near the home of her paternal grandparents, Terence and Lesley Payne. She had been playing with her older brothers Luke and Lee and younger sister Charlotte, before she was snatched. Charlotte Payne posted a heartfelt tribute to her father on Facebook after his death in October this year . Mr Payne was found dead in his first floor flat in Maidstone after his family called police to check up on him . Sara and Michael Payne were pictured at their Surrey home in 2002 after their daughter's killer was jailed . Her body was found on July 17 in a field near Pulborough, some 15 miles from Kingston Gorse where she had disappeared. A high profile investigation which used sophisticated forensic evidence led to the conviction of Whiting for the murder in 2001 after a blonde hair was found in his van. Whiting, who had previously been in prison for assaulting a young girl, had moved to Sussex before Sarah was abducted. He was sentenced to life in prison and his minimum term was released from 50 years to 40 in 2010. This will mean Whiting, who is now 55, will be in his eighties if he is released. At the time Mr Payne criticised the decision as 'outrageous.' Roy Whiting was convicted of Sarah's murder . In December 2001, Roy Whiting was sentenced to life in prison with a recommendation that he never be released after a jury found him guilty of the abduction and murder of Sarah Payne. After he was convicted, the court heard he had a previous conviction for the kidnap and indecent assault of a nine-year-old girl. The jury, who had been unaware of the previous sex conviction, were told Whiting had been sentenced to four years in jail for the sex attack in June 1995. Revelations Whiting already had a history of child abuse prior to the killing of Sarah prompted a national debate about how paedophiles are dealt with in the justice system. Mr and Mrs Payne began actively campaigning for a law change, piling pressure on ministers to allow people to know about convicted paedophiles living in their area. In the wake of Whiting's sentencing, Mrs Payne said: 'The Government only can make this decision. Right now, we have got a lot of work to do and it doesn't stop here. It just begins. You know what change I want, Sarah's Law.' The rule, eventually introduced in 2011, allows concerned parents or grandparents to contact police to find out if a new boyfriend, or a neighbour, who has contact with a child, has a history of child sex offending.

"Nick Clegg last night joined calls for Shaker Aamer to be returned to Britain from Guantanamo Bay. The Deputy Prime Minister said the father of four should be released after nearly 13 years in high security detention. He insisted Mr Aamer should not be left in ‘infinite legal limbo’ without trial and instead face a proper judicial process. Campaign: Nick Clegg (left) last night joined calls for Shaker Aamer (right) to be returned to to Britain from Guantanamo Bay after nearly 13 years in high security detention . The Lib Dem leader’s comments came after the Daily Mail published a letter signed by celebrities, civil rights campaigners and politicians calling on David Cameron to increase pressure on the United States to free Mr Aamer. Yesterday more lent their names to the letter. They include the Love Actually actor Bill Nighy, Amnesty director Kate Allen and four MPs, including former Tory minister Sir Alan Duncan and former Labour frontbencher Diane Abbott. The letter was also signed by Natalie Bennett, the Green party leader. From the arts, new signatories include film director Ken Loach, singer-songwriter Charlie Winston, the playwright David Hare and the author Jeanette Winterson. The poet laureate, Carol Ann Duffy, and her predecessor Andrew Motion, have also signed the letter as has Susie Orbach, the psychotherapist and writer. Mr Clegg made his comments at his regular monthly press conference in central London. Asked if Mr Aamer should be released he said: ‘Yes of course Shaker Aamer should be returned. ‘It’s a point we have made at all levels of government repeatedly to the Americans. At the end of the day if people must face justice, they must face justice, but not be suspended in this infinite legal limbo. ‘That is why we have made the case as repeatedly as we have, that given he is a British citizen, that we want to see him released from Guantanamo Bay and if necessary dealt with through the proper judicial process outside Guantanamo Bay.’ Sources close to the Deputy Prime Minister said the Government was making every effort to secure Mr Aamer’s release and had raised the issue repeatedly with the US government. Mr Aamer is resident in Britain legally, is married to a Briton and has four British children. He has been held in the infamous detention facility for more than a decade without being tried. Amnesty director Kate Allen and film director Ken Loach have both lent their names to the letter . Four MPs, including former Tory minister Sir Alan Duncan (left) and former Labour frontbencher Diane Abbott (right) have signed the letter . The renewed focus on his case came after the explosive Senate report into CIA use of torture during the so-called ‘War on Terror’. According to his family, who live in Battersea, South London, the 46-year-old wants to stand trial over allegations he is a terrorist with close links to Osama Bin Laden. His lawyers allege there is a more sinister reason behind his continued detention – that officials fear he could expose evidence of torture carried out in the presence of British intelligence officers. Downing Street insists that the Government continues to press for a resolution to the case at the ‘highest levels’. Mr Aamer has been cleared for release twice, first in 2007 under George W Bush, and two years later by his successor Barack Obama. According to his family, who live in Battersea, South London, 46-year-old Mr Aamer (pictured with two of his children) wants to stand trial over allegations he is a terrorist with close links to Osama Bin Laden . But his detention has been extended again and again because officials insist he must go back to Saudi Arabia, where he was born, rather than home to Britain. He was detained in Kabul, Afghanistan, in 2001, and handed to US forces, who allegedly tortured him at a secret ‘black site’ prison. The letter calls on David Cameron to ‘pick up the phone to President Obama, and bring Shaker Aamer home’. It is being organised by the We Stand With Shaker campaign and has been signed by MPs from across the political spectrum. The letter says Mr Aamer’s continued detention without charge or trial is ‘in violation of the right not to be arbitrarily imprisoned that was enshrined in Magna Carta’. n The US government could this week be forced to make public thousands of photos of its soldiers abusing detainees in Iraq and Afghanistan. A legal challenge is being mounted to ensure the release of the 2,100 images which reportedly include troops posing for ‘trophy’ photos with dead bodies. The photos, dating between 2001 and 2005, are said to show female soldiers with hooded, shackled prisoners who were stripped naked. Other images depict hooded prisoners on transport planes with Playboy magazines opened to pictures of nude women on their laps. Others show US soldiers threatening sexual violence.","Nick Clegg joins calls for Shaker Aamer to be released from Guantanamo .

"Many people in Britain would probably find it tough to survive without their car - and for those in Peterborough, this could be especially true. That is because the Cambridgeshire city is the hardest place in England to live without a car, according to a survey. As well as residents there, people in Colchester in Essex and Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire are also said to particularly struggle if they have no access to a motor. Cambridgeshire city: Peterborough is the hardest place in England to live without a car, according to a survey . Other places where not having a car can be a real disadvantage include Swindon, Wigan, Bradford, Derby and Dudley in Worcestershire, the survey by the Campaign for Better Transport (CBT) found. London, with its extensive public transport network, is considered the least car-dependent location among the 29 English cities and towns surveyed. The CBT rated each location on the four categories of accessibility and planning; buses and trains quality and uptake; cycling and walking as alternatives; and driving and car use. On Peterborough, the CBT found the city had ‘weaknesses in its public transport infrastructure’ and people there were heavily reliant on cars. But it added: ‘There are some signs of hope, however, as many people already cycle regularly, showing there is scope for improvement and a will for active travel.’ Colchester was seen as the location where residents were least likely to be able to get to primary school, work or the town centre by walking or public transport. Also tricky: People in Colchester (left) in Essex and Milton Keynes (right, on the nearby M1 - where there are often delays at J14) in Buckinghamshire are also particularly up against it if they have no access to a motor . The spread-out nature of Milton Keynes meant longer distance for people to have to travel. On London, the CBT said: ‘The capital's control of its transport policy offers lessons for other cities and policy makers keen to reduce car dependency.’ The second least car-dependent location was Manchester, followed by Liverpool, Brighton and Hove and Newcastle-upon-Tyne. CBT chief executive Stephen Joseph said: ‘To be good places to live and work, towns and cities need good transport. The most successful places in our research give people a choice in how you get around. ‘They have good quality public transport, plan new development thoughtfully and make it easy and safe for people to cycle and walk.’ He went on: ‘There is a lot that Government can do to make our cities less car dependent. What emerges strongly from the research is that local control often goes hand in hand with smarter policies and better targeted investments. ‘More devolution to English cities could mean more integrated and greener transport networks that make our towns and cities better places.’ 1.

"The family of a Chinese teenager executed after being convicted of murder and rape 18 years ago, howled in anguish as he was declared innocent by a court today in a rare U-turn by the country's courts. Hugjiltu was just 18 when he was found guilty of raping and murdering a woman in Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, in 1996 and was put to death just 61 days after the woman was murdered. But doubt was cast on the verdict when another man confessed to the crime in 2005, leading to the case being reopened by the Inner Mongolia Higher People's Court in Bobatu last month. Scroll down for video . Shang Aiyun, the mother of Hugjiltu, is dragged away from his tomb amid howls of anguish from the family . Shang Aiyun (left) wails in pain at the grave of her son (right), who was wrongly executed at the age of just 18 . After the court in the autonomous region of northern China issued a statement today finding Hugjiltu not guilty, the dead man's mother, father and brother burned a copy of the decision on his grave in a highly charged protest. In papers issued to the family at their home, the court ruled the original guilty verdict to be 'not consistent with the facts' and having 'insufficient evidence'. As he delievered the papers Zhao Jianping, the deputy president of the court, made a profound apology for its mistake in sentencing the teenager, also known as Qoysiletu, to death . After Hugjiltu's mother Shang Aiyun had to be dragged from the teenager's grave as she wailed in pain, his brother Zhaoligetu told Sina.com: 'My mother wished him 'rest in peace' and hoped he could reincarnate.' Mr Jianping gave Hugjiltu's parents compensation of 30,000 yuan (£3,093), the official Xinhua News Agency reported. The money was a personal donation by the head of the court, it added, rather than an official payment by the institution. Hugjiltu's parents Li Sanren, left, and Shang Aiyun, centre, receive news of the court ruling today . Hugjiltu's mother falls upon the grave of her son, branded a rapist after his wrongful conviction for murder . 'This is an amazing thing the court did, to admit that they were wrong,' said Wang Gongyi, deputy director of the research institute of the Ministry of Justice. 'It also sends a clear message to the police and prosecutors around the country – if there's not enough evidence, don't impose wrongful convictions,' he told AFP. 'In the future this case will be singled out as what not to do and will influence the entire legal system.' In Hugjiltu's case, authorities interrogated the teenager for 48 hours, after which he confessed to having raped and choked the woman in the toilet of a textile factory, the state-run China Daily newspaper reported last month. After he was executed in June 1996, Hugjiltu's family tried for nearly two decades to prove his innocence. Finally it was found Hugjiltu's confession did not match the autopsy report, was inconsistent with 'other evidence', and that DNA evidence presented at the trial did not definitively connect him to the crime. Police in Hohhot, the capital of Inner Mongolia where the crime took place, said they had opened an investigation into the officers responsible for the original case, according to the Legal Evening News. Hugjiltu's parents face the media after news of their son's conviction had been quashed came through . Shang Aiyun burns a copy of the court statement in protest at her son's wrongful execution . Hugjiltu's parents have campaigned for nearly two decades to have their son's conviction overturned . China has occasionally exonerated wrongfully executed convicts after others came forward to confess their crimes, or in some cases because the supposed murder victim was later found alive. In one case, police claimed a body was that of a woman who had recently disappeared and charged Teng Xingshan with her murder. Teng was executed by firing squad in 1989, but in 1993 the supposedly murdered woman returned to the village saying she had been kidnapped. Teng was exonerated of all crimes in 2005. Several other high-profile wrongful convictions have sparked public outrage in recent years. Last year, a man who served 17 years in prison for killing his wife was declared innocent by an appeals court in the eastern province of Anhui. A few months earlier two men who had been sentenced to death and life in prison in 2004 for the alleged rape of a 17-year-old girl, were also acquitted. Many on social media decried what they saw as insufficient compensation for such a grave miscarriage of justice, with one asking: 'Is 30,000 yuan really enough to buy the life of a family member?' Campaign groups and experts welcomed the court decision and said it was a signal to the rest of the justice system that it must perform better. China's courts, controlled by the ruling Communist Party, have a near-100 per cent conviction rate in criminal cases and confessions extracted under dubious conditions are commonplace. Leaders of the ruling party have promised to strengthen the rule of law 'with Chinese characteristics', but experts caution the concept refers to greater central control over the courts, rather than judicial independence. The country put an estimated 2,400 people to death last year. 'The central government wants to use this case to send a clear signal to police and courts that they need to do a better job,' said William Nee, China researcher at Amnesty International. 'But without transparency in death penalty cases, it will be hard to determine if progress is being made.'","Hugjiltu was 18 when he was found guilty of raping and killing a woman .

"'British jihadi' Simon Keeler, 43, of east London was among those charged with terror offences . When police stopped a suspicious looking lorry leaving Britain from Dover late one night, little did they suspect what they would find inside. For crowded in the back was a Libyan terror suspect allegedly carrying an order for £18million of ammunition, two Britons suspected of plotting to fight with Islamic State in Syria and 17 illegal immigrants – all attempting to flee the country. Yesterday details emerged for the first time of the extraordinary raid by Scotland Yard on November 30 this year, as three men found in the vehicle appeared in court charged with terrorist offences. Westminster magistrates heard that among the 20 stowaways was Abdulraouf Eshati, 28, who yesterday appeared in court accused of carrying records relating to the purchase of $28.5million (£18.2million) of anti-aircraft, machine gun and AK47 ammunition and an order form for the £500,000 hire of a Russian cargo plane, all of which were said to be bound for Tobruk in Libya. Prosecutor Mark Dawson said: ‘Very late on 30 November, a lorry, an articulated lorry, was stopped at the port of Dover leaving the country. Within the back of the lorry were some 20 people. It is clearly a people trafficking operation. One of the people was this defendant. On his phone were documents.’ Scroll down for video . He added: ‘The first document “Defence and Software” relates to an order form, it seems, from a Swiss arms company for the delivery of $28.5million dollars’ worth of heavy duty military ammunition: half a million dollars’ worth of ammunition, which is 22 tonnes of 7.62mm ammunition for AK47 type weaponry; $10million dollars for 275 tonnes of 14.5mm ammunition for heavy machine guns; and $18million dollars for 807 tonnes of 23mm anti-aircraft ammunition. Chase: Would-be illegal immigrants race after a lorry to board it in Calais this October . Ambition: Keeler had intended to ‘flee the country, with plans to travel to Syria to fight for the Islamic State' '1,100 tonnes of ammunition in total. It is heading towards Tobruk in Libya.’ Yesterday Eshati, a Libyan immigrant, spoke through an interpreter only to say his name, date of birth and confirm that he has no known address in the UK. He did not enter a plea to the charges. Separately, five other defendants facing terror charges also appeared at court, two of whom were found to be travelling in the same lorry. Michael Coe, 33, and Simon Keeler, 43, both of East London, were held at the same time as Eshati. Mr Dawson said Coe and Keeler had intended to ‘flee the country, both with plans to travel to Syria to fight for the Islamic State’. Former boxer Anthony Small is among six men charged over an alleged plot to smuggle extremists abroad. Another man (not pictured) who also appeared in court today allegedly had an order form for arms with him when he was arrested . Both were found to be carrying false passports and driving licences, it was claimed. Police later arrested former British boxing champion, Anthony Small, who is suspected of plotting to join them in Syria. The 33-year-old Islam convert who won both the British and Commonwealth championships in 2009, appeared in court with them. All three men are charged with preparation of acts of terrorism, and conspiracy to possess false identity documents. Yesterday the three radicals refused to sit down in the dock because of their ‘religious beliefs’, the court heard. The charges were brought after two men were allegedly found among migrants in a lorry at the Port of Dover . Tony Lodge, defending, said they wanted to remain standing because they ‘bow to the will of god alone.’ Two others also appeared in court, Hamzah Safdar, 24, and Zagum Perviaz, 35, accused of running a large-scale operation from a kebab shop in East London producing identity documents for people intending to commit terrorist acts, the court was told. All six suspects were remanded in custody, and the cases will appear on January 9 at the Old Bailey.

"An endangered Siberian tiger released into the wild by Vladimir Putin has continued its killing spree, feasting on a pet dog. Kuzya was filmed devouring the hound for two hours on Heixiazi island, which sits on the Amur river between Russia and China. The beast, who has also killed a flock of chickens on its rampage across north-east China, is now believed to have returned to Russia. It's a cat eat dog world: Kuzya the tiger, released into the wild by Vladimir Putin, has continued its killing spree in China, eating a pet dog . The endangered Siberian tiger was one of three cubs released into the wild by Putin in the summer, but while two have stayed in Russia, Kuzya defected to China earlier this year . Kuzya, seen wearing a GPS tracking device, attacked and killed the pet dog in the early hours of Wednesday, China Central Television reported. The endangered Siberian tiger was one of three cubs released into the wild by Putin in the summer, but while one stayed in Russia, Kuzya and another defected to China earlier this year. Satellite tracking showed the rare Amur cat swam across a river - evidently in search of a Chinese meal after a shortage of its staple of deer in eastern Russia. In October Kuzya, who is 21 months old, attacked a hen house in northern China, eating five chickens and infuriating farmers. Animal remains were found near the tiger's tracks, and feathers and blood near a smashed hen house. The big cat was spotted again in Taipinggou nature reserve in Heilongjiang province and some 60 cameras have been set up in a bid to track him. The Russians alerted Beijing through diplomatic channels amid fears angry farmers might shoot the tiger. Chen Zhigang, the nature reserve director, said a Russian expert had informed him of Kuzya's location and had 'expressed hope that we can protect it'. Kuzya, seen wearing a GPS tracking device, attacked and killed the pet dog in the early hours of Wednesday . Kuzya, who is 21 months old, attacked a hen house in northern China earlier this year, eating five chickens and infuriating farmers . Kuzya (pictured) was followed across the border by another Putin cub, Ustin, which killed two goats . Last month another of the tigers, Ustin, followed Kuzya into China, killing two goats, with another three going missing. The dead goats' skulls had been crushed with puncture holes 'the size of a human finger clearly visible', a witness said. A wildlife protection expert has warned people not to throw food at the tiger if spotted. Mr Putin was praised by Russian media for saving a television crew from an attack by a Siberian tiger back in 2008. The Russian president apparently saved the crew while on a trip to a national park to see how researchers monitor the tigers in the wild. Just as he was arriving with a group of wildlife specialists to see a trapped Amur tiger, it escaped and ran towards a nearby camera crew, the country's main television station said. Mr Putin quickly shot the beast and sedated it with a tranquilizer gun. Despite the attacks, the foreign ministry in Beijing pledged that Putin's tiger would be protected, citing an existing agreement on cross-border protection of Siberian tigers. 'We will make joint efforts with the Russian side to protect wild Siberian tigers which travel back and forth between China and Russia,' spokesman Hong Lei said in a statement. Earlier Russian ecologists expressed fears for the animal in China. Vasiliy Gorobeiko, deputy head of natural resources management in the Jewish Automomous Oblast republic in eastern Russia - where the tiger was roaming before he crossed the border - said China was more populated and he could be shot for worrying farm animals. 'Certainly, China will be informed about President Putin's tiger via Foreign Affairs ministry channels but time is needed for this information to reach local ecologists, and before then the tiger may well alarm the local villagers and may even suffer,' he said at the time. 'Kuzya knows how to avoid people and did so well in Russia but in that agricultural area of China, it will be hard for him.' The Siberian tiger, also known as Amur tiger, is on the Red List of Threatened Species. In 2010, Russia launched a national strategy to protect the Siberian tiger, the largest of the five tiger species. According to World Wildlife Fund, just 450 Siberian tigers are left on the planet.","Kuzya the Siberian tiger killed and ate a pet and dog in north-east China .

"Friends and family of 18-year-old fisherman Daniel Smith have taken to Facebook to pay tribute to the teenager who was killed by a shark on Monday, after being bitten on the upper thigh, groin and upper arm. An outpouring of tributes on social media include comments such as 'taken too soon', 'RIP Smithy' and 'thoughts are with his family and friends', remembering the popular teenager who graduated from high school just weeks before. The mayor of the Douglas shire, Julia Leu, offered her condolences calling Daniel a, 'much-loved local high school graduate', reports ABC. 'Our hearts very much go out to his family. It is a real shock to all of us that this has occurred. Scroll down for video . Friends and family take to Facebook to pay tribute to teenage fisherman Daniel Smith killed by shark attack on Monday . People have taken to social media to express their grief and shock at the death of the former Mossman State High School student . 'He had just completed year 12 at Mossman State High School - he was a lovely fellow and we are very, very sad that this has happened.' The Melbourne born, Queenslander was  attacked in the water at Rudder Reef, off Port Douglas, in far north Queensland at around 11am on Monday. He is said to have been swimming when he lost part of his leg, reports The Guardian. The trip back to shore by boat is said to be a two-hour journey. Friends who were travelling with the teenager on a private boat alerted authorities and performed emergency first aid, using a defibrillator that was on board. A Queensland ambulance was called to Sugar Wharf in Port Douglas as Daniel was brought ashore . Friends who were travelling with Daniel on a private boat alerted authorities and performed emergency first aid . Attempts were also made by Queensland Ambulance to resuscitate him but he died on Monday afternoon, the ABC reports. The victim, who is local to the area, was pronounced dead before the boat brought him back to Sugar Wharf in Port Douglas at 2pm,The Cairns Post said. Queensland Ambulance Service executive manager of operations Greg Thiedecke said: 'When they arrived, the people [on the boat] were still doing CPR on him, trying to save him. 'We did have Mossman hospital on stand-by with a doctor ... but unfortunately when we arrived, he was well and truly passed.' Thiedecke added: 'It would be speculating but [there are] a lot of large blood vessels in the groin area, so for him to go into cardiac arrest that quickly would be probably blood loss.' Queensland Ambulance Service executive manager of operations Greg Thiedecke told The Cairns Post he believes the death was due to loss of blood . It's not known what kind of shark was involved in the attack. A coroner's report will be prepared for the police. Veteran diver Col McKenzie, who also heads the Association of Marine Park Tourism Operators, told Australian Associated Press that Rudder Reef was not a common spot for dive tourism operators. But he said it was popular with spear fishing enthusiasts, and that there was a fatal shark attack at nearby Opal Reef almost a decade ago to the day. Spearfisherman Mark Thompson, 38, died from a heart attack soon after being attacked by a shark December 11, 2004. A 18-year-old boy has been killed by a shark after being bitten on the upper thigh . Reef Great is part of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park in far North Queensland . St Crispin's reef separates Opal and Rudder reefs, and there is little distance between them. Mr McKenzie said spear fishers who were attacked by sharks typically suffered thigh injuries because they often tucked bait into their weight belts. 'A lot of people do spear fish in that area but whether that's what's happened here, I don't know,' the Cairns resident said. The teenager died from his injuries before arriving back at Port Douglas .","The 18-year-old was killed at Rudder Reef, off Port Douglas, in far north Queensland while on a tour boat with friends .

"Radio 4's Today programme is being investigated over claims it celebrated drug use in a news report about Bob Marley-branded cannabis. Ofcom will examine whether the BBC 'condoned, encouraged or glamorised' the illegal drug in what reporter Simon Jack jokingly described as a 'puff piece'. Jack interviewed Brendan Kennedy, an American investor who has joined forces with the Marley estate to launch the 'world's first global cannabis brand'. The 'Marley Natural' strain will initially be sold in American states that have legalised the drug . The five-minute report was filled with reggae music and clips of Marley's children advocating cannabis use. The 'Marley Natural' strain will initially be sold in American states that have legalised the drug. Marley, who died of cancer in 1981, embraced cannabis as part of his Rastafarianism, and supported its legalisation. However, David Raynes, of the National Drugs Prevention Alliance, said the BBC's handing of the topic was irresponsible. Ofcom will examine whether the BBC 'condoned, encouraged or glamorised' the illegal drug in what reporter Simon Jack jokingly described as a 'puff piece' 'As a public service broadcaster it has a duty to be fair and balanced,' he said.

"A group of artists have claimed responsibility for hanging three effigies of lynching victims around the University of California-Berkeley campus this weekend. The artists, who say they are a 'collective of queer black and (people of color) artists, posted a message on a campus bulletin board today saying that the images - which many students and faculty found deeply offices - were part of an art project. The statement said the perpetrators are from the San Francisco Bay area - but does not state whether the people behind it are students. Scroll down for video . 'History must be confronted': The artists who hung effigies of lynching victims were largely unapologetic and remained anonymous in a note that claimed responsibility for the 'art project' Lynched figure: A cardboard cutout of a young man - believed to be 1911 lynching victim Lawrence Nelson - was found on campus at the University of California in Berkeley . The artists did not identify themselves, but said that the intention was to draw parallels between the 21st century police killings of Michael Brown and Eric Gardner and the 20th century lynchings by mobs in the South. The aim, they said, was not to terrorize or intimidate. 'We apologize solely to black Americans who felt further attack by this work. We are sorry - your pain is ours - our family's, our history's,' the note says. Campus police, who took down at last two of the three effigies over the weekend, told MailOnline they are still investigating the incident. Lieutenant Marc DeCoulode said that detectives have not yet identified the perpetrators. However, if they find them, officers will refer the case to the district attorney's office for charges. Cut-out: Police are investigating the incident, in which another cut-out labelled Laura Nelson was found. It had #ICan'tBreathe written on it - which is a slogan picked up by Eric Garner protesters . Unrest: Protesters from Berkeley - long a hotbed of liberal activism - have taken to the streets in recent weeks to protest the police killings of Michael Brown, Eric Garner and other black men . 'The statements doesn't identify any individuals or known groups,' Lt DeCoulode said. 'We've looked at the statement but that doesn't really clarify a lot.' Each of the three figures read 'I can't breathe', which are the final words of Garner as he was filmed being taken down and killed by a group of officers. The highly-visible effigies appear to have been set up to coincide with a protest event Saturday afternoon. A spokesman for the school told USA Today: 'It certainly could have been racially motivated, so we're taking it very seriously and are very interested in finding out who did this and what the intention was'. Online: People used social media to share images of the cut-outs. A university spokesman said that racial issues could be at play . Spencer Pritchard, a 21-year-old student involved in the demonstrations, said he hoped the effigies were the work of 'someone who wanted to bring attention to the issue.' The demonstrations coincided with protests nationwide, where as many as 50,000 protests converged on major cities around the country to protest over police killings of black men. One of the figures shown on the effigies was named as Laura Nelson, a black woman who was lynched in Oklahoma in 1911, the year written on the figure. Her 18-year-old son, Lawrence, was also killed after a mob broke into their jail cell and carried them to be hanged. The two were in prison for allegedly shooting dead a sheriff's deputy. History: The figures depicted - Laura and Lawrence Nelson - were lynched in 1911 in Oklahoma.

"He was one of the most famous racehorses in British history, winning 36 races before retiring in 1824. And now archaeologists believe they may have discovered the skeleton of the legendary 19th century stallion Doctor Syntax. The remains were found during excavations at the former royal stables of Palace House, one of the homes of King Charles II, in Newmarket, Suffolk. Experts said the skeleton is almost completely intact and measures the same height as the famous horse. Archaeologists believe they may have discovered the skeleton of the legendary 19th century stallion Doctor Syntax in Newmarket, Suffolk . He was put down in 1838 but his exact resting place was never known despite his historic past. Historians at the National Horseracing Museum  said it was possible they have finally found his body during the excavation for the new National Heritage Centre for Horseracing and Sporting Art. Curator Graham Snelling said: 'A member of the public told us he had read that Doctor Syntax was buried at Newmarket Palace House stables. 'Then, when the skeleton was discovered, it was a potential possibility. 'Where it was buried, it would make sense. Doctor Syntax was euthanised here in 1838. 'It was a very careful digger driver that spotted the skeleton. It would be an amazing find if it turned out to be Doctor Syntax. 'He was one of most consistent racehorses of his time. He went to stud here in 1824. He was a good sire as well as a great racehorse. Doctor Syntax was put down in 1838 but his exact resting place was never known despite his historic past . The racehorse was born in Yorkshire 1811 and won more than 36 races from 1814 to 1823 before retirement . 'It could also be a royal racehorse. Its location does not suggest it wasn't. It is very exciting. It makes you think what else is there to find.' Archaeologist Chris Faine, of Oxford Archaeology, said he was not convinced the skeleton was that of Doctor Syntax due to the age of the horse's teeth. The horse is believed to have been 28 when he died but Mr Faine puts the mystery horse at 18 to 20 years old after examining its teeth. He said: 'There's no trace of any other injuries on the skeleton. The skull was heavily smashed, which means I can't tell from it whether it was euthanised. 'I'm told that the preferred method from that period was a medium gauge shotgun behind the ear which wouldn't have done the skull lot of good anyway. It's more than possible it was put to sleep. 'It was certainly a racehorse, all the evidence points to that. I don't think it could be Doctor Syntax, but you would have to carry out DNA tests to make sure. 'It was in a specifically dug grave and was not just manhandled in. It could be a royal racehorse, but it is impossible to say for sure. It was carefully buried.' He revealed the racehorse was born in Yorkshire 1811 and won more than 36 races from 1814 to 1823. Mr Snelling, who has been at the museum for 22 years, said he could not say whether it would become an exhibit and would consider carrying out a DNA test. He welcomed anyone who has further information that could shed light on the identity of the horse to get in touch. The first royal residence in Newmarket was built in 1608 by James I who found the nearby heath land ideal for horse racing and the first race was recorded in 1622. But racing was  suppressed during the Commonwealth Period as a calculated political act because race meetings were seen as an unwelcome opportunity for royalist gatherings. Shortly after the Restoration, Charles II had the stables repaired or rebuilt by John Bayspoole in around 1664. The Palace House Stables stand opposite what remains of the racing palace of Charles II. Charles II established the Town Plate in October 1665 which is still run to this day. The King actually rode in the race himself, winning in both 1671 and 1675. He appointed Robert Baynton as his Keeper of the Running Horses at Newmarket. The majority of Charles II's complex was demolished early in the 19th century and 'building materials' were advertised in local newspapers. A new National Heritage Centre for Horseracing and Sporting Art is currently being built at the site. Excavations were taking place at Palace House (pictured) in Newmarket, Suffolk, originally built by James I .","Archaeologists believe they may have found the skeleton of Doctor Syntax .

"A nationwide strike in Belgium has brought rail, road and air transport to a standstill and seen protesters try to hurl eggs and fireworks at government offices. The 24 hour strike is the country's first general strike since 2005 and comes in the wake of a new government's plans to save £8.7billion in the next five years. In the Belgian capital of Brussels, police resisted striking workers who tried to throw eggs and fireworks at the offices of Flemish separatist party N-VA, one of the four parties in the Belgian government. A lone passenger gazes up at the departures board at Brussels Airport where about 600 flights were grounded . A passenger takes a nap in the deserted Eurostar terminal at the Midi/Zuid railway station in Brussels . Union members are opposing a decision by Belgium's PM to scrap a cost-of-living wage, which is due in 2015 . The strike forced hundreds of factories and offices to shut. Around 600 flights were grounded at Brussels Airport today and Eurostar cancelled all Brussels-bound trains in France. Most trains on the high-speed Thalys link line between Paris and Brussels were also cancelled, with local bus, tram and metro services also affected. At the port of Antwerp, one of the busiest in Europe, more than 50 ships were unable to enter or leave. In the western city of Ghent, unions blocked a major road by a plant of steelmaker ArcelorMittal. A stranded passenger stands near an information desk in the deserted Brussels airport today .

Unions called the strike a great success, but Flemish business group Voka said 77 percent of the firms it surveyed in Brussels and the northern region of Flanders had all their workers in. A siege in Ghent, which turned out to be a hoax, also meant the impact of the strike was overshadowed. Unions are opposing a decision by Prime Minister Charles Michel - Belgium's new leader - to scrap a cost-of-living wage next year. Belgian law currently mandates that wage rise at the same pace as inflation. They are also protesting against public sector cutbacks and plans to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67. These reforms are part of a plan to plug the country's budget deficit, which stands at 3 per cent of GDP for 2014. The public sector movement began early last month with 100,000 people taking part in a march in Brussels that ended in clashes leaving 112 police injured. Several vehicles were set alight by protesters who also hurled stones and flares at police. About 50 people were hurt and 30 detained, officials said. Mr Michel was sworn in as prime minister in October. The 38-year-old French-speaking liberal is Belgium's youngest leader since 1841.","24 hour strike in Belgium is the country's first general strike since 2005 .

"She was one of Britain's best-loved leaders and her family is still grieving her death less than two years ago. But that has not stopped the BBC from broadcasting a 'sick' story fantasising about the murder of Margaret Thatcher. The work by Booker Prize-winning author Dame Hilary Mantel is to be read on Radio 4's Book At Bedtime early in the New Year. The short story is about a middle-class housewife who unwittingly lets an IRA hitman into her home . The work by Booker Prize-winning author Dame Hilary Mantel is to be read on Radio 4's Book At Bedtime early in the New Year . The decision to air The Assassination Of Margaret Thatcher has led to further accusations of 'intrinsic and endemic' Left-wing bias at the BBC. Former Cabinet minister Lord Tebbit said: 'It is a sick book from a sick mind and it's being promoted by a sick broadcasting corporation.' The short story is about a middle-class housewife who unwittingly lets an IRA hitman into her home. It concludes with the terrorist taking aim at the Prime Minister and remarking: 'Rejoice, f****** rejoice' – a parody of Mrs Thatcher's comments when she announced a British victory during the 1982 Falklands War. Conservative MPs said it was an 'astonishing' decision to broadcast the story on January 9, while Baroness Thatcher's family were still grieving. Angie Bray said: 'It's disappointing and very surprising that the BBC could not find a book that would not have caused such offence.' Lord Tebbit, pictured at the funeral of Margaret Thatcher, attacked the BBC for choosing to air the book . Lord Tebbit, pictured to the right of Margaret Thatcher in 1987, said: 'It is a sick book from a sick mind and it's being promoted by a sick broadcasting corporation' Conor Burns, Lady Thatcher's closest confidant and adviser in her final days, said: 'Given the public controversy that surrounded Hilary Mantel's original publication of this twisted little story from her disordered mind, it seems calculating of the BBC to choose it for Book At Bedtime.' Andrew Bridgen said: 'The BBC aren't even subtle in their bias – it's intrinsic and endemic.' Lord Bell, a former adviser to Lady Thatcher, said: 'If the BBC had any real sensibility it would leave that subject alone with an election just five months away. It is inevitably going to be accused of political bias.' Wolf Hall author Dame Hilary, who could not be contacted for comment yesterday, has said the work was inspired by her own fantasy about killing the former prime minister. The BBC said: 'Book at Bedtime offers the best of modern and classic literature and, in doing so, presents a wide range of perspectives from around the world. 'The work of Hilary Mantel – a double Booker Prize-winning author – is of significant interest to the public and we will not shy away from the controversial subject matter that features in one of the four stories read across the week.'","Decision to air book led to accusations of 'endemic' left-wing bias of BBC .

"A new portable razor aims to save women from those hairy situations when they realize they missed a spot shaving. Leila Kashani, of Los Angeles, California, has created the Sphynx, a sleek, compact razor that includes soap, two blades and a refillable water container with a spray nozzle. Ms Kashani, 29, has launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund production of the product, which will be available to purchase for approximately $16.99 in April 2015. Scroll down for video . Razor-sharp idea: The Sphynx, created by Leila Kashani, is a portable three-in-once device that includes two blades, soap and water for on-the-go shaving . The campaign officially ends on December 19, but she has already exceeded her goal of raising $25,000 by nearly $400. 'Too many times was I in situations where I was heading to the beach or traveling for work and realized that I missed a spot,' Ms Kashani says in a video on her Kickstarter page. 'I spent months researching razors that claimed to be on-the-go,' she adds. Cutting edge: A model is seen using the product, which will be available for purchase in April 2005 . 'The ones that were small enough didn't include soap or water, which leads to razor burn. And the ones that did include it were definitely not purse-friendly.' Ms Kashani spent 'countless nights' gluing and taping prototypes together and making pages of sketches before she came up with the Sphynx's clever design. She adds that its all-natural organic soap can be rubbed in like moisturizer after the shave, so there's no messy residue to rinse off. In addition to the Sphynx's original black and white models, Ms Kashani plans to manufacture a colorful array of razors in bright patterns and shows 15 different versions on her website. Refills will not be sold, so when the soap runs out and the blade becomes dull, customers will have to buy a replacement razor. Bright future: In addition to the Sphynx's original black and white models, Ms Kashani plans to manufacture a colorful array of razors in vibrant patterns . Ms Kashani told MailOnline that the idea for a discreet on-the-go razor first came to her when she was just a teenager. 'I was 13 years old, heading to the beach, and somehow missed a spot and didn't realize it till I got there. This is unfortunately something I still deal with to this day,' she said. She added: 'I've heard so many people complain about a missed spot that it's what drove me to really bring Sphynx to life. I've also heard many scenarios where people avoided an activity because they weren't prepared for it. Even as simple as going to the gym after work because they didn't shave their underarms.' Ms Kashani has worked in marketing for brands such as Nike and Columbia Sportswear since graduating from the University of California, San Diego in 2008.","According to creator Leila Kashani's Kickstarter campaign, 94per cent of women report missing a spot when they shave their legs ."
"Three days shy of his sixteenth birthday, a Chicago teen was shot and killed Saturday when he tried to save his twin brother after four robbers ambushed the boy demanding his coat. 'Get off my brother!,' Demario Bailey yelled as his twin brother Demacio struggle break free from one of the four assailants, the Chicago Tribune reports. Demacio began to run, thinking his brother was behind him. He heard a shot go off and turned to find his twin brother lying on the ground with a gunshot wound to the chest. The robbers ran away and Demario died moments later. Shot: Demario Bailey (right) was shot and killed Saturday trying to defend his brother Demacio (left) when four robbers ambushed them under a Chicago viaduct . Freedom: The boy's mother usually took the boys to and from where they needed to go, but recently decided to give them 'a little more freedom' Carlos Johnson, 17, has been charged with first-degree murder in Demario's slaying as well as charges for his involvement in two nearby robberies, according to the Tribune. Known around town as the 'Bailey boys,' Demario and Demacio were headed to Demacio's basketball practice around 12.40pm  that fateful afternoon and were walking under a viaduct when Johnson and three other boys approached them, FOX 32 News reports. Collapsed: Demario died moments after he was shot, and as his body was taken away, his mother collapsed to the ground, inconsolable as four women struggled to get her to her feet . Memorial: Communty members placed stuffed bears, flowers, and signs under the viaduct as a memorial for Demario . Good Kid: Bailey's family as well as school officials and students from Johnson College Prep in Englewood, where the boys attended school, spoke highly of Demario who was an honor roll student . The robbers ordered the identical twins to 'give it up' as they searched the boy's pockets. A struggle began and a fight ensued resulting in Johnson firing at the teen. Demacio was with his brother when he died that day in broad daylight. '[Demacio] is traumatized, traumatized. Can you imagine you're walking with your brother one minute and the next minute your brother is laying on the ground?' Faliata Holman, Bailey's cousin, told FOX. As Demario's body was taken away, his mother collapsed to the ground, inconsolable as four women struggled to get her to her feet, New York Daily News reports. Bailey's family as well as school officials and students from Johnson College Prep in Englewood, where the boys attended school, spoke highly of Demario who was an honor roll student. Demario was not on the school's basketball team with his identical twin brother, but Ceddrick Hunter, the school's basketball coach, said that he was 'basically a part of the team' and described Demario as an 'all-around good kid,' according to the Tribune. Ketica Guter, a history teacher at the school, told the tribune that Demario 'truly embodied the motto, ‘I am my brother’s keeper.' On Sunday night, community members, mainly mothers who knew the pain of losing a child to violence, took to the street near the viaduct where the teen was murdered. The group held up signs that read 'All Lives Matter' as they chanted 'peace up, guns down.' Bernice Fitzpatrick, the twin's grandmother, told the Tribune that the boy's mother usually took them to and from where they needed to go, keeping a close watch on her sons. She said the boys began asking to go places on their own. 'We promised them we would give them a little more freedom,' Fitzpatrick said. 'We let them go for one month.

"Nearly a quarter of 15-to-18-year-olds said they were more likely to take legal highs after visiting the Government's drugs advice website, official figures show. Following visits to the FRANK website during a Government campaign to warn teenagers of the dangers of 'new psychoactive substances' (NPS), 22 per cent of 15-to-18-year-olds said they were more likely to use legal highs in the future. Just over a third (34 per cent) claimed they were less likely. Nearly a quarter of 15-to-18-year-olds said they were more likely to take legal highs after visiting the Government's drugs advice website . The figures are taken from a survey on the website which only 195 teenagers of the relevant age group responded to, equating to just under 43 saying they were more likely to take legal highs. The results of the survey emerged in an answer to a written parliamentary question from shadow home affairs minister Diana Johnson. Replying, Home Office Minister Lynne Featherstone said: 'Two hundred and seventy-eight people responded to the survey hosted on the FRANK website. After visits to the FRANK website during a Government campaign to warn teenagers of the dangers of 'new psychoactive substances', 22 per cent of 15-to-18-year-olds said they were more likely to use legal highs . 'Of the 278 respondents, 195 were the primary target audience of 15-to-18-year-olds for the NPS campaign run over summer 2014. 'Following their visit to the FRANK Website, 22 per cent of 15-to-18-year-olds claimed they were more likely to take so-called 'legal' highs in the future, and 34 per cent claimed they were less likely. 'The survey ran from August 4 until October 7.'","Almost a quarter of people aged 15 to 18 more likely to take legal highs after visiting Government's drug advice website .

"Tony Blair today moved to reject claims his government was complicit in the torture of terrorist suspects by CIA agents. The former Prime Minister, facing growing calls to appear before MPs over what he knew about American 'enhanced interrogation techniques when he was in Downing Street, said he had 'always been opposed to the use of torture'. It came as the clamour for a judge-led inquiry into Britain's role in torture grew - with former Home Secretary Alan Johnson and shadow minister Yvette Cooper joining calls for the former prime minister to be quizzed on Britain's role in the barbaric treatment of prisoners by the US. Scroll down for video . Former Prime Minister Tony Blair and the then Foreign Secretary Jack Straw are facing questions over what they knew about CIA torture . Shadow home secretary Miss Cooper yesterday broke ranks to say she believed an investigation by a judge might be needed to get to the truth about torture. Her intervention means the Labour front bench is on the verge of supporting an inquiry that could be hugely embarrassing for both Mr Blair and David Miliband – the brother of the party's current leader. But a spokesman for Mr Blair's office said: 'For the avoidance of doubt, Tony Blair has always been opposed to the use of torture, has always said so publicly and privately, has never condoned its use and - as is shown by internal government documentation already made public - thinks it is totally unacceptable. 'He believes the fight against radical Islamism is a fight about values, and acting contrary to those values - as in the use of torture - is therefore not just wrong but counter-productive.' It came after MPs said former foreign secretary Jack Straw –  who has been interviewed as a 'witness' by detectives investigating the rendition of two Libyan dissidents – must also be held to account. Last night, former Tory Attorney General Dominic Grieve backed the calls for a judge-led inquiry once the police investigations are over, saying it was needed to provide 'finality'. And former shadow home secretary David Davis told Sky News a judge must take charge. He said: 'One must understand the sheer weight of pressure that comes from the Establishment to try and stop this sort of stuff coming out, so I think this needs to be a judicial inquiry.' At Westminster, the weekend was dominated by the continued fallout from last week's Senate Intelligence Committee report, which detailed how detainees had been subjected to torture such as waterboarding. Mr Cameron continues to cling to the position that an inquiry by Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee is the best way of finding out the level of Britain's involvement. In a publicity blitz, ISC chairman Sir Malcolm Rifkind yesterday said he had asked the Senate committee to reveal the redactions, requested by British security officials, which led to all mention of MI5 and MI6 being removed from the 499-page report. Sir Malcolm Rifkind told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show this morning that he would seek to question former ministers over Britain's role or complicity in torture . Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said her 'instinct' was to call for a full judicial inquiry into UK torture . Home Secretary Theresa May has insisted she did not request any redactions to an American report that exposed brutal CIA interrogation methods in a bid to cover up any UK involvement. Mrs May did concede that officials had requested that no evidence was included in the Senate Intelligence Committee's report that would damage national security. But she told the Home Affairs Select Committee she could not speak for previous Governments. Her appearance before the Committee comes as the Government faces mounting cross-party calls for a new judicial inquiry into Britain's possible role in the shocking treatment of detainees in the years after the September 11 attacks. Committee chair Keith Vaz said he would be asking US Senator Dianne Feinstein, who chairs the American committee that published the CIA torture report, and a Republican, to give evidence next year. The Home Secretary said she had not read the full 6,000-page report and had only seen the 500-page summary made publicly available . 'I have certainly not asked for any redactions to take place in the report,' she said. 'The only time I met Senator Feinstein was in September of this year and I've not seen the draft report, I've not asked for any redactions in that report. We discussed other things.' He also said his committee would ask any former or serving minister with a contribution to make to give evidence – putting the spotlight firmly on Mr Blair, Mr Straw and Mr Miliband. Sir Malcolm added: 'If they refuse to do so, that in itself would imply they have something to hide. If there is evidence they knew or were involved then of course they would be priority figures for our investigation. 'If people deserve to be embarrassed it's our job to embarrass them. We have a statutory obligation to carry out this task without fear or favour.' However, he admitted that he had no way of compelling the Americans to hand over an uncensored copy of the report. He also conceded he could not say he was 'confident' of success. Home Secretary Theresa May will be grilled today by the Home Affairs Select Committee on the extent of her contact with the Senate committee and whether she personally lobbied for any redactions. ISC member George Howarth said it was right to seek details of redacted material but questioned why it should come from the US. He said the priority should be to seek answers directly from the Government and intelligence agencies. The Labour MP added: 'It could take months and what we are asking for already exists in London.' Miss Cooper said she doubted the ISC 'have the capacity and the scope' to carry out an inquiry, adding that her 'instinct' was that a judge-led process would still be required to ensure confidence. She told the BBC that Mr Blair and other former ministers had 'always said that they would co-operate with all investigations and have said that they would be very keen to do so'. Miss Cooper added that it was important to get to the truth to make sure there was no 'shadow of innuendo or allegations cast over the vital work that the [security] agencies rightly do to keep us all safe every day of the week'. Former home secretary Mr Johnson said Mr Straw and Mr Blair should go before the committee. Asked on the Andrew Marr show if they should give evidence, he said: 'Yes, absolutely, yes.' Former deputy prime minister Lord Prescott also called for a judicial inquiry. He wrote in his Sunday Mirror column: 'We must have a transparent system that reflects our values of fair play and justice, not one that turns a blind eye and deaf ear to claims of the abduction and torture of innocent people.' Former Prime Minister Tony Blair met the former Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi at his desert base outside Sirte south of Tripoli in 2007 . A Parliamentary committee has called on the US government to hand over any evidence of British complicity in torture. Last week a US Senate report exposed the 'brutal' treatment of al-Qaeda terror suspects in the wake of 9/11. Downing Street has admitted that some material was removed from the report at the UK's request, for national security reasons. But it said no redactions related to British involvement in the mistreatment of prisoners. The House of Commons Intelligence and Security Committee is conducting an inquiry into the treatment of detainees by British intelligence agencies in the decade following 9/11. Sir Malcolm Rifkind, who heads the intelligence committee, told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show it would request to see redacted material in the Senate's public report if it referenced the UK. He said that if British intelligence officials were present when people were being tortured then they were complicit in that torture. 'That would be quite against all the standards of this country, it would be something that ought to be brought into the public domain,' Sir Malcolm added. Tory Defence Secretary Michael Fallon called for Mr Straw and Mr Blair to reveal what they knew about the CIA's torture and rendition programme when they were in office. He said: 'Obviously it's for them, it's for former ministers to account for the relationship then. I hope they will co-operate with any parliamentary inquiry.' Civil liberties groups and campaigning MPs accuse Britain of repeatedly turning a blind eye to torture during Mr Blair's 'war on terror' – when he worked hand in glove with the Bush administration. There are allegations that British agents were present when torture took place and that the UK helped with rendition flights. Yesterday, one of the two psychologists who were paid to run the interrogation programme by the CIA insisted UK agents were at torture sites. Dr James Mitchell, who devised the brutal 'enhanced interrogation' programmes, said: 'I'd see their special operations people at the sites I would visit.' Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable said the ISC and police investigations into the Libyan renditions should be allowed to 'run their course'. He added: 'If at the end of it, it doesn't appear that the truth is emerging, that people imagine there is some kind of cover-up, then of course a judge-led inquiry is the right way to proceed.' Isabella Sankey of human rights group Liberty said: 'Until our Government sets up a transparent, judicial inquiry, cover-up and official impunity will persist.'","Former PM and Foreign Secretary face Parliamentary grilling over torture .

"The Sydney siege has thrown a spotlight on the disturbing growth of terror threats in Australia in recent months, with one expert claiming that the country is being targeted because it is a 'soft target'. 'I suspect that cities in Australia or Canada are seen as relatively soft targets, compared with London where you can't turn a corner without seeing a heavily armed policeman nowadays,' said historian Michael Burleigh. In September, Australian police carried out the largest counter-terrorism raids in the country's history, after uncovering an alleged plot to behead a member of the public just yards away from the Lindt cafe that is currently under siege. Scroll down for video . Omarjan Azari, 22, who was arrested in Sydney in September, was accused of a 'horrific plot' Islamic State suspects held by armed officers during the predawn raids in Sydney, Australia, in September . A curved sword inscribed with Arabic writing was recovered at the scene of terror raids in Sydney, Australia, in September . Armed police hold a suspect during anti-terror raids in September . Men detained by police during police raids in Sydney in September . A 22-year-old Sydney man arrested in the nation's largest counter-terrorism operation allegedly conspired with Australia's most senior Islamist militant to launch a deadly attack on a random passerby . Forensic experts collect evidence from a house in the Guildford area of Sydney on September 18 . Australia has sent hundreds of special forces advisers to Iraq to assist in the struggle against ISIS, adding it to a list of countries thought to be at increased risk of terror attacks. It is unknown whether the gunman holding hostages at the Lindt cafe is a 'lone wolf', part of an organised terror cell. In November, ISIS released an audio message purportedly from its self-styled Caliph Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, calling for jihadists to carry out 'lone wolf' attacks against Muslim Shi'ite and Westerners all over the world. He singled out Australia, Europe, America, and Canada as targets, saying the West had launched a 'slanderous' media campaign against ISIS 'to reduce its supporters and followers.' 'Dismember their limbs; snatch them as groups and individuals,' he said. 'Erupt volcanoes of jihad everywhere'. In September, more than 800 police officers carried out raids in Sydney's north-west, detaining 15 people. Bundles of cash and a curved sword inscribed with black foreign lettering were some of the incriminating pieces of evidence removed from a Sydney home during the terror raids. According to NBC, the raids were believed to be linked to the death of 33-year-old Mohammad Ali Baryalei, Australia's most senior known member of ISIS, who was reportedly killed in Syria. Shortly afterwards, an ISIS spokesman, Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, urged Muslims in Australia to carry out lone-wolf terror attacks, saying that they should 'not let this battle pass you by' and kill an Australian civilian or soldier — or 'any other disbeliever' — in 'any manner or way', reported NBC. At the time, Channel Seven reported that the random beheading was intended to be carried out in the streets of Martin Place in Sydney's central business district - the location of the Lindt cafe. According to ABC, the abducted member of the public would be draped in an Islamic State flag and beheaded on camera. This raises fresh fears for the hostages held inside the Lindt cafe, one of whom has been filmed drawing her hand across her throat in fear. The fact that the same location was selected for both operations raises questions about the security arrangements at the site. Professor Jeff Lewis, a terrorism expert at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, said that Martin Place and the Lindt cafe had been chosen 'because it would get maximum publicity' and because it represented the spoils of Western society. Martin Place is one of Sydney's most high-profile shopping precincts with upmarket restaurants, cafes and bars, high-end fashion boutiques and designer shops including Giorgio Armani. It is also the location of the Channel Seven Network office, assuring the terrorist of almost instantaneous media coverage. Although five hostages have escaped from the Lindt cafe, fears are mounting about the 15 people that remain inside. Hostages have been seen with their hands pressed against the windows holding up the flag of extremist group Jabhat al-Nusra, which is fighting the Assad government in Syria. The Wall Street Journal reports that many Islamic leaders attribute the extremism among some Australian Muslims to an event in December 2005. A fight between young Muslim men and two white lifeguards on a suburban beach near Sydney led to a demonstration. About 5,000 non-Muslims attended, some chanting racist slogans. According to the Wall Street Journal, this mob then 'viciously attacked dark-skinned beachgoers'. This led to a spate of street violence carried out by gangs of young people 'of Arab descent'. About 476,000 Muslims live in Australia, many of them refugees of the unrest in Lebanon in the 1970s and 1980s. Many are relatively wealthy and have assimilated into Australian society. The current hostage crisis is the culmination of a steady escalation of terror activity in Australia, where all the signs have been indicating that the threat of Islamic extremism is worsening. Shortly after police swooped on terror targets in September, an 18-year-old jihadi stabbed two police officers in Melbourne. In October, Julie Bishop, Australia's Foreign Minister, revealed that 'at least 70 Australians are in Iraq and Syria fighting with the terrorist organisations now'. About 185 Australians are known to be involved with extremists in the Middle East, she said, an increase from about 150 in recent months. This number includes those who are supporting such organisations through activities such as recruitment and funding. David Livingstone, Associate Fellow on the International Security Programme at the think tank Chatham House, said that nevertheless, the Sydney attack is a 'wake-up call' that will reverberate around the world. 'People hitherto have thought Australia to be a relatively safe place from this threat of terror,' he said. 'In Britain the threat is much more serious than in Australia, and yet we see this happening. A lot of people will be sitting up and taking notice now.' A hostage runs towards a police officer outside Lindt cafe, where other hostages are being held, in Martin Place in central Sydney . Hostages flee the Lindt Cafe in central Sydney, where a man has taken more than 15 people prisoner . In response to this burgeoning threat, Australia has been aggressively tightening its anti-terror legislation to counter the threat of Islamist terror on its own shores. In November, the Senate  passed legislation which also allowed the Australian Federal Police to issue 'control orders' for people suspected of supporting or facilitating foreign fighters. This was a controversial move, as it allowed police to detain suspects without charge. The new laws enabled the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) to conduct counter-terrorism activities in Iraq without having to wait for written approval by a senior minister. It also changed the means by which the foreign minister, who is responsible for ASIS, authorises the agency to undertake activities relating to a 'class of Australian persons' rather than individuals. Attorney-General George Brandis said the orders were not about punishment but preventing terrorist attacks. 'We're talking about terrorism here. We're talking about the destruction of lives, the destruction of property,' he told parliament. 'Once the conduct has occurred, it's too late.' There are concerns that the increased terror threat, coupled with the toughening up of the law enforcement's response, will lead to a polarisation of society that may turn violent. About 70 men have had their passports confiscated in recent months, based on the suspicion that they were planning to fly to Syria to join the ranks of ISIS, authorities have said. And on Monday, Australian Federal Police arrested a 25-year-old man from Sydney on suspicion of financing terrorism. It is not thought that there is a link between that arrest and the Lindt cafe siege. Tony Abbott, Australia's prime minister, said: 'The whole point of politically motivated violence is to scare people out of being themselves. 'We have to appreciate that even in a society such as ours, that there are people who would wish to do us harm. 'That's why we have police and security organizations of the utmost professionalism that are ready and able to respond to a whole range of situations.' In an effort to alleviate growing tensions, 50 Muslim organisations have released a statement of condemnation. 'Our immediate thoughts go to the hostages and their loved ones,' it says. 'We pray for their safety and hope this matter is resolved quickly and peacefully. 'We reject any attempt to take the innocent life of any human being, or to instill fear and terror into the hearts. 'Any such despicable act only serves to play into the agendas of those who seek to destroy the goodwill of the people of Australia and to further damage, and ridicule the religion of Islam, and Australian Muslims throughout this country.' Australians also used social media to express their outrage, as well as their solidarity with their Muslim compatriots, in an attempt to counter fears that the hostage crisis would spark a cycle of tit-for-tat violence. On Twitter, the hashtag #illridewithyou quickly started trending, reflecting Australians' view that Muslims should not be treated with suspicion on public transport in the wake of the Lindt cafe attack.","A beheading plot foiled by police in September was planned to take place just yards from the Lindt cafe, where hostages are now being held .

"Sydney cafe siege gunman Man Haron Monis forced several of his hostages to record chilling video messages which were uploaded to YouTube before the terror attack came to a dramatic close. At least three female captives were forced to read Monis' list of demands - which included a phone conversation with Australian Prime Minister, a public declaration that the attack was being carried out by Islamic State terrorists, and the delivery of an Islamic State flag to the Lindt chocolate cafe. The clearly terrified hostages - including Westpac executive Marcia Mikhael,42, and  Selina Win Pe - were forced to sit in front of banner adorned with Islamic slogans while reading from what appeared to be a pre-prepared script expressing their faux-bewilderment at why Monis' demands had not yet been met. Despite the area around the cafe being under police lockdown, Monis was able to temporarily upload his videos to YouTube before having his account suspended and the footage removed. Scroll down for video . Composed: At least three female captives, including Selina Win Pe (pictured) were forced to read Monis' list of demands which included a phone conversation with Australian Prime Minister, a public declaration that the attack was being carried out by Islamic State terrorists, and the delivery of an Islamic State flag to the Lindt chocolate cafe . Hostage: The other two videos uploaded to YouTube also feature women listing Monis' demands . The first video shows a woman wearing a black and white patterned blouse who identifies herself as 'one of the many hostages' held at the Lindt chocolate cafe in Martin Place, Sydney city centre. 'We had three specific requests and none of them have been met,' the woman says, speaking quickly and looking anxious. 'One [request] is to send an IS [Islamic State] flag as quickly as possible and one hostage will be released,' she adds. The woman goes on to list Monis' demands, which include: 'To please broadcast to all media that this is an attack on Australia by the Islamic State. And number three is that we need [Australian Prime Minister] Tony Abbot to contact The Brother on a live feed and five hostages will be released.' Her reference to 'The Brother' is a clear indication that Monis was using the name as a kind of nom de guerre throughout the siege. Marcia Mikhael, a Westpac bank executive who had called in for her morning coffee on Monday, was forced to record a chilling video message in which she was forced to act shocked that the terrorist's demands hadn't been met while sat in front of black banner adorned with Islamic slogans . After listing Monis' demands, the woman goes on to claim that the jihadi has planted three bombs in the area surrounding the cafe. Police later stated that this claim, which Monis also made during conversations with hostage negotiators, was not true. The other two videos uploaded to YouTube from within the Lindt chocolate cafe also feature women listing Monis' demands - two of which are related to the Islamic State terror group. As in the first video, the second and third clips also show the terrified women being forced to act shocked that the terrorist's demands hadn't been met, while continuing to request Australian Prime Minister make contact with 'The Brother' using some sort of digital live feed. In each video, the hands of a man wearing a white jumper or T-shirt can be seen holding an Arabic-language religious banner behind the women, although his face is never seen. While the siege was taking place, Monis managed to temporarily upload the video footage to YouTube before it was briefly taken down. Gunman: Self-styled Iranian sheikh Man Haron Monis demanded police officers bring him an ISIS flag, make a public announcement that the attack was carried out by ISIS, and request to speak with Tony Abbott . Hostages run away from the cafe after Australian police stormed the building and shot Man Haron Monis dead . The 17-hour siege came to an end with Monis and two of his hostages dead, and four more suffering injuries after police stormed the building and a dramatic and chaotic firefight ensured. Earlier in the day reporters claimed to be able to see the terrorist wandering around inside the cafe holding a tablet computer. The device is likely to have been used to post the video clips online. The 17-hour siege came to an end with Monis and two of his hostages dead, and four more suffering injuries after heavily armed police stormed the building and a dramatic and chaotic firefight ensured. New South Wales Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said 17 hostages had now been accounted for. He urged people not to 'speculate' or 'develop theories' about what happened inside the cafe and said police believed more lives could have been lost if officers had not entered the cafe at that point.

A 34-year-old woman and 38-year-old man have died in the aftermath of the siege. Of the injured, two women have non life-threatening injuries and a police officer was injured by gunshot pellets, the police said. Another woman has a gunshot wound to the shoulder. Live television coverage earlier showed at least two people being taken away from the scene on stretchers, while one hostage was seen being carried out of the building. She appeared to be in pain and blood flowed down her legs.","Terrorist Man Haron Monis forced hostages to record  video messages .

"Pope Francis has told Roma gypsies to 'get a job' and integrate more in society. Speaking during a visit to a Roma community, the Pope told 40 gypsy members to try and contribute more. He said: 'Seek work and integration, without ever succumbing to despair. I greet you and I wish all good things for you. That you will always have peace in your families, that you have work, that you have joy.' He then said: 'The Church is with you, it welcomes you always, especially this parish. Always be close to the Church. Don't lose hope.' After the speech, Pope Francis greeted and hugged the Roma gypsies present in the Prima Porta suburb of Rome. Pope Francis poses for a selfie during his visit at the St Joseph parish church in Rome yesterday . After his traditional Sunday window appearance, the Pope visited a Roma community and urged them to integrate more in society . Previously Francis has called on Roma gypsies to 'contribute to the common good.' Earlier this year he acknowledged that they are often deprived of education and healthcare and viewed with 'hostility and suspicion' compelling reasons for this lack of participation in civic society. But he said: 'The Gypsy people are also called on to contribute to the common good, and this is possible with adequate paths of shared responsibility, observing the obligations and promoting the rights of each one.' Pope Francis kisses a child as he arrived to visit the St Joseph church - he later called for Roma gypsies to contribute more to the common good in an address to a Roma community . Italy, which has one of the largest Roma populations outside Romania, has experienced problems between local and gypsy communities. In March hundreds fled one of the country's largest camps near Naples after a mob attacked them, following an alleged attempted rape of an Italian girl. Elsewhere, a bakery in Rome was criticised for posting a sign in its window warning that access was 'strictly forbidden to gypsies'. The Pope has tried to hit out at prejudice against gypsies, urging people to stem their suspicion and calling on authorities to help those 'at the margins of society'. In a series of off-the-cuff remarks in June, he said he has seen for himself the way in which parts of Italian society regarded them. 'I remember many occasions here in Rome where I would get on the bus and some Gypsies would get on too, and the driver would say: ""Keep an eye on your wallets"". This is scorn; it might be true, but it's scorn,' he said. In his comments, Francis acknowledged that the situation presented 'a complex reality'. But he emphasised social factors which he said led to many gypsies becoming susceptible to 'new forms of slavery' in society such as forced begging.","Pope Francis has urged Roma gypsies to 'get a job' and integrate more .

"BT customers could face higher bills after the company bid £12.5billion for Britain's biggest mobile phone firm, EE. The deal could make BT a one-stop shop for households seeking a landline, mobile contract, broadband internet and premium TV services. BT has recently undergone aggressive expansion, buying rights to Premier League football for its new sports channels. This has been funded in part by repeated, inflation-busting rises for existing customers – which began just weeks after the launch of BT Sport. This month saw standard line rental for Direct Debit customers rise by a further 6 per cent. The deal could make BT a one-stop shop for households seeking a landline, mobile contract, broadband internet and premium TV services . At least half of the £12.5billion bid would be paid in cash, raising the spectre of further price hikes. Analyst Dan Ridsdale of Technology Media Telecoms said the deal would also 'reduce churn – as it is much more complex to change service providers when a customer is using them for multiple services'. BT had also been considering an attempt to buy back O2, which it owned under the brand Cellnet before it was spun off in 2002. EE was formed in 2010, following a merger of French firm Orange and T-Mobile, which is part of the German company Deutsche Telekom. It has some 25million UK mobile phone accounts, and owns the country's largest and best-developed high-speed 4G mobile data network. However, it also has the worst customer satisfaction levels among mobile phone providers, according to regulator Ofcom's latest figures; just 69 per cent approve of their service, compared with 78 per cent at O2. Its prospective new owner, BT, won Money Mail readers' Wooden Spoon Award this year for the worst customer service in Britain. The firm, which has nearly 10million landline and broadband customers, admitted that it had struggled to deal with a flood of new accounts after the launch of BT Sport. The sector is currently moving towards ‘quad play’, where the four major services – mobile, broadband, landline and TV – are sold in one package (stock image) Yesterday a BT spokesman said: 'The proposed acquisition would enable BT to accelerate its existing mobility strategy whereby customers will benefit from innovative, seamless services that combine the power of fibre broadband, Wi-Fi and 4G.' BT plans to give Deutsche Telekom and Orange a mixture of cash and shares; the firms would respectively hold 12 per cent and 4 per cent stakes in BT. However, analysts said regulators should block BT from taking such a dominant position over rivals such as Sky and Virgin. Barry Collins of PC Pro said: 'Even the notoriously spineless Ofcom must be concerned about one company having such influence over the entire telecoms market. BT simply cannot be allowed to dominate both fixed-line and mobile.'","Deal could BT a one-stop shop for households seeking a landline, mobile contract, broadband internet and premium TV services .

Jam fit for a King: Prince Charles accepted a free jar from his neighbour Mrs Gerghiceanu, 63 . The heir to the throne owns two properties in Romania and has a keen interest in the history of Transylvania . Mrs Gerghiceanu was even invited to the Romanian Cultural Institute in London to put on a dinner at a Transylvania festival attended by the Prince. She said: 'People have accused me of cashing in on the fact that Prince Charles tried some of my jam and liked it, and accepted a free jar, but in fact people are investing in the future when they buy my jam. Every time I sell a jar, I pay a local woodsman to plant five oaks in the local forest. 'I use only organic ingredients in my jam, because I don't know any other way. And I even cook the fruit organically because I use a wood stove fire from the local forest, and then fund the planting of replacement trees.' Known locally as Mama Gerda, Mrs Gerghiceanu says her special recipe has been handed down through her family for generations and is made of only natural ingredients. 'I include rose hips, strawberries and mirabelle plums, with everything being prepared on a reed bed. Something like this is worth investing time in,' she said. 'The jars that the jam is sold in are handmade by local glassblower, and the jars complete with contents are then stored in a specially made casket again made from locally produced oak trees.' Prince Charles' interest in Romania was sparked by his first visit to the country in 1998 and he has visited regularly since . After impressing the the heir to the throne with her jam, Mrs Gherghiceanu has upped the price because of a huge increase in demand for her preserve . Mrs Gerghiceanu was even invited to the Romanian Cultural Institute in London to put on a dinner at a Transylvania festival attended by the Prince, pictured meeting locals at a market . As well as the expensive 800g jam jars, Mrs Gherghiceanu and her husband Nicu also sell more reasonably priced homegrown fruit and vegetables, as well as poultry, pork and lamb. Prince Charles' last visit to Viscri came in May, when he met with Count Kalnoky Tibor, a descendent of Hungarian noblemen, when he was not sampling the jam. The heir to the throne owns two properties in Romania and has a keen interest in the history of Transylvania. The Prince said: 'Ever since I first visited Romania in 1998, I have been doing my utmost to ensure a sustainable future for the Saxon villages of Transylvania and their people.' Prince Charles' interest in Romania was sparked by his first visit to the country in 1998 and he has visited regularly since. He was said to be 'totally overwhelmed by its unique beauty and its extraordinarily rich heritage' after the visit. The Prince has a keen interest in the history of the area and was particularly moved by the plight of Saxon villages in Transylvania, which were built centuries ago by German settlers who were encouraged to go there to help withstand Tartar and Turkish invasions. Many of these settlements are now in decline because of mass migration to other parts of Europe, including Britain. Prince Charles owns both an 18th century Saxon house in Viscri (left) and a farmhouse in the village of Zalánpatak . Because of this, in 2006, he decided to buy and restore an 18th century Saxon house in Viscri, which is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Blue House, which he bought for £12,000,  has blue limewash on the facade, against which are set olive-green shutters. Inside, the courtyard, partly cobbled, is planted with vegetables. A vine grows beneath the eaves. The furniture consists of old-fashioned painted chests and time-worn wooden benches. There are only three bedrooms, two bathrooms and a kitchen. He also bought a secluded farmhouse in the village of Zalánpatak, just yards from a forest, in 2010. The main cabin, heated by log fires and traditional ceramic stoves, has only three rooms. All the furniture - carved wooden beds, 19th-century chairs, an old oil lamp suspended from the ceiling, and an ancient radio - were restored by hand.

"The man, who can only be identified as Mr R, was handed an order preventing him from seeing his children or entering his street. Mr Justice Peter Jackson (above) overturned the order at appeal . A father suffered a Kafkaesque injustice when he was thrown out of his home without warning and effectively barred from seeing his six children for five months, a High Court judge said yesterday. After being banned from his street, the man was later jailed overnight and convicted of a crime for phoning his wife. Mr Justice Jackson accused lawyers and courts of injustice due to ‘unproven allegations’. The father, named only as Mr R, was barred from his home after his wife took out a non-molestation order. He was also forbidden from contacting her except via her lawyers. Such orders are designed to protect women from domestic violence. But Mr Justice Jackson said the ban was granted ‘in proceedings of which [Mr R] was unaware’. The hearing before a district judge on June 20 lasted no more than five minutes. Mrs R’s lawyers did not attempt to contact her husband and he knew nothing of the order until he came home from work one day later that month. Despite the claim that his wife was in danger of violence, she allowed him to stay overnight and he left the following morning. Days later, he was arrested for an ‘innocuous breach’ of the order after calling his wife to ask about the case, Mr Justice Jackson said. She phoned police and he was held overnight and taken to court. With no lawyer, he pleaded guilty to breaking the order, and was sentenced to a day in prison. ‘He was a man of good character who now has a criminal record,’ Mr Justice Jackson said. ‘And … the effect of the original order was to deprive him of contact with his children for fully five months. All in all, Mr R could be forgiven for feeling like the hapless protagonist in Kafka’s The Trial.’ The novel tells the story of a man arrested and prosecuted by a remote authority, which never specifies the crime he is supposed to have committed. The man was handed the order  after his wife went to London's High Court (pictured). Mr Justice Peter Jackson said Mr R could be forgiven for feeling like Josef K - in Franz Kafka's 1925 novel The Trial . The Trial is the terrifying novel about Josef K, a respectable bank officer who is suddenly and inexplicably arrested. The book, which was written in 1914 but not published until 1925 - a year after author Franz Kafka’s death - follows Josef K's need to defend himself against the charge about which he can get no information. It details his struggles and encounters with the law and the courts following his arrest, which came on his 30th birthday despite the fact he had committed no wrong-doing. Mr Justice Jackson said that following marriage problems, Mrs R had contacted solicitors in May, hoping to persuade Mr R to leave. The lawyers applied for a court order, saying the wife was at risk of harm. They claimed Mr R had shoved her, thrown objects, and had pushed her to the floor 17 years ago. The application added that the wife had previously been expected to ‘engage in distasteful sexual practices’ and that her husband had controlled the finances. But Mr Justice Jackson said the only recent incident listed was a row over a credit card bill and that the order was ‘entirely unrealistic’. It was five months before an appeal reached the High Court, which ruled the order should never have been made. It found 11 injustices by the courts that granted and maintained the order. The father, who can now see his children, told the court in a letter he was ‘disillusioned with the justice system … which removes me from my home and family with a completely fabricated statement’. A police report said Mrs R begged officers not to arrest Mr R over his phone call and that her solicitor had told her to contact them.

"Senior doctor Dr Steven Forde, 45, has been suspended for nine months for secretly filming a woman in a mini skirt in York city centre . A senior doctor and father-of-three who secretly filmed a miniskirt-wearing woman as a 'reward' after a hard day's work has been suspended for nine months. Dr Steven Forde, 45, used a camera hidden in an adapted satchel to take five minutes of covert footage as the woman walked through York city centre in May last year. He was acquitted of criminal charges after prosecutors offered no evidence - but a Fitness to Practise panel ruled his actions amounted to misconduct after hearing they were 'sexually motivated'. But today, a panel decided to suspend the doctor for just nine months after he insisted he had cleaned up his act. Forde, a former RAF medic who once served in Bosnia and Kosovo, told the panel he has been undergoing treatment for the 'underlying issues' that cause his behaviour and said he had not indulged in any secret filming since his arrest. The tribunal heard the York Hospital consultant used a concealed digital camera equipped with a telephoto lens, which he operated using a 'fire switch' hidden in a specially adapted bag. During the police investigation Forde admitted he had filmed women before and said he had other images at home, the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester heard. But the married doctor, from Haxby, near York, was acquitted of outraging public decency after the CPS brought no evidence against him. Police found other clandestine video recordings on his home computer, but no charges were brought, the panel heard. During a trust investigation Forde admitted that this type of behaviour happened the 'majority of the time once or twice a week' and 'more in the summer months.' Forde, a former RAF medic who once served in Bosnia and Kosovo, told the panel he has been undergoing treatment for the 'underlying issues' and said he had not indulged in any secret filming since his arrest . Father-of-three Forde told the panel that on May 9, 2013 he had been working at York Hospital until midnight and was on call until 8am. He said: 'I took my camera off to some woodland a few miles away to take some photographs of the scenery. 'I was looking for forest scenery. I wanted spring flowers, that sort of scene. 'I then went into the city centre. I was going away with friends for the weekend who I was going to play hockey with.' He then said he adapted his camera to record video of whatever it was pointing at. 'I took footage of a woman walking down the pavement through the centre of town. According to a security guard, this included the woman's 'legs, skirt and body'. He was then detained for voyeurism. The tribunal heard the York Hospital (pictured) consultant used a concealed digital camera equipped with a telephoto lens, which he operated using a 'fire switch' hidden in a specially adapted bag . Last week he claimed the incident followed three 'stressful events' in his professional life, including a a formal complaint made against him by a patient who said he was 'rude and aggressive'. He said he had to give evidence at the GMC after a medical student he was in charge of continued onto third year even though he hadn't been signed off. In a third incident, he said he had to help transfer a three-week-old baby to Leeds hospital but the baby died. He said: 'I found the experience one of the most stressful things I've ever done. Those legal practises - most of us are not used to this sort of environment. 'It doesn't justify what I did, but in my mind the stresses inhibited me from dealing with the behaviour that was causing this.' Forde, who was supported by wife Beverley throughout the hearing, confessed to a ten-year 'compulsion' that led him to commit similar acts as a kind of 'reward' in times of stress. He was handed a formal warning and returned to work in March this year, though he is not allowed to examine female patients without a chaperone 'except in life-threatening situations'. He was also prohibited from attending formal meetings with female trainee doctors unaccompanied in his role as Training Programme Director with York Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.","Dr Steven Forde, 45, has been suspended as a doctor for nine months .

"Revamp: Putting in new flooring and carpets for a newborn's room could cause breathing difficulties . It is only natural to want your home to be perfect before your baby is born. But laying new flooring could damage your unborn child’s health, experts warn. They have found new flooring can cause breathing problems in babies, and new carpets were particularly harmful. The German researchers asked more than 450 mothers about their health and their baby’s health, and whether they had redecorated during pregnancy or in the first year after birth. They were asked to specify if they had bought new furniture and if they had laid new flooring including carpets, laminate and PVC sheeting. Air samples from their homes were tested for volatile organic compounds, chemicals that are released by flooring glues or the flooring itself. This revealed a clear link between new flooring and breathing problems, with babies most likely to be affected if work was done when they were still in the womb, the journal Environment International reports. Children whose parents had a history of allergy were more than five times as likely to be treated by their doctor for wheezing by the age of one if new flooring was put in during pregnancy. The researchers, from the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research, said avoiding powerful glues reduces the amount of chemicals but doesn’t eliminate the danger. They wrote: ‘Similar public health effects may be assumed for other countries with western life style and moderate or northern climate. ‘We therefore do not recommend that laminate, carpet or floor coverings be laid in the homes of pregnant women.' They said that doing without powerful adhesives cuts the amount of chemicals released – but doesn’t eliminate the danger. Survey: The German researchers recommended leaving it a year before carrying out major work (file photos) They recommend parents wait until their child is at least a year old before doing renovations. Recent British research suggested doing up old homes could put mothers and unborn babies at risk of lead poisoning. Lead is now banned in paint, but it can be released from old paint as it is stripped away. Potential sources include cornices and skirting boards, as well as floorboards that are being stripped down to create fashionable bare-look flooring.","German researchers quizzed 450 mothers about their renovations .

"A seaside town fired at by volleys of shells in a  bombardment, which left 18 dead on the home front during the First World War, is commemorating those who lost their lives. Tomorrow  marks exactly 100 years since the residents of Scarborough, North Yorkshire, were unexpectedly attacked by three German warships, damaging schools, homes, churches, hospitals and the lighthouse. The shelling, which started shortly after 8am on December 16, 1914, left 18 people dead and 200 others injured and it took years for the coastal town to rebuild itself. Scroll down for video .

The castle will be lit up during the ceremony and a flotilla of boats will be stationed outside the harbour.

Scarborough's Wykeham Street (pictured) was targeted in the bombardment as the town started waking up on a cold winter's morning 100 years ago . The 1914 raid was the first successful one on British shores for 250 years, since a Dutch fleet sailed up the Thames and the Medway and destroyed much of Charles II’s navy in Gravesend and Chatham. Although a number of lives were lost, including that of 14-month-old John Shields Ryalls, it is believed that the toll could have been much higher as the winter weather and the early hour meant less people were around. The raid became important in the war as a mode of propaganda after Winston Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty and a leading public figure, denounced them as the ‘baby-killers of Scarborough’ for their unprovoked attack on a defenceless population. It was then used in a recruitment drive and to stir up bad feelings against the Germans. Posters were printed, which read 'Remember Scarborough! Enlist now.'

"A prolific thief who was fitted with a GPS electronic tag after being released from prison has returned to jail after being traced to seven different burglaries during a three-week period. Aron Thompson, 26, was one of the first criminals in Britain to receive the device as part of a Ministry of Justice trial to replace the need for defendants to report to police stations or have nightly curfew checks. However, just three weeks after he was released from prison on November 20 last year, the tag traced him to the location of seven burglaries, including one just five days after he left prison. He has now been jailed for two years at Birmingham Crown Court after admitting all seven burglaries. His accomplice, 25-year-old Tony Babington, has also been jailed for accompanying him on two of the burglaries. Aron Thompson, 26 (left), was fitted with a GPS electronic tag after being released from prison in November last year and was traced to seven burglaries just three weeks later. He has been jailed at Birmingham Crown Court for two years, alongside his accomplice Tony Babington, 25 (right), who took part in two of the raids . The court heard how detectives were able to place him at each burglary thanks to the electronic tag which was fitted with Global Positioning System (GPS) accurate to ten metres. Detective Constable Mark Bird, from West Midlands Police, said: 'As part of the pilot, Thompson signed consent forms agreeing data could be taken from it and used in evidence should he be suspected of committing criminal offences. 'Many prisoners are allowed to complete part of their jail sentence in the community on licence but they must abide by strict conditions and if they breach those terms they can quickly expect to be back behind bars. 'Thompson is a prolific thief who, if he fails to change his ways, has a bleak future ahead of him and can expect to spend many years away from society.' This map shows the vicinity in which Thompson committed the seven burglaries whilst wearing a tag . Five days after being released from prison on licence, Thompson kicked his way into a house in Yardley, Birmingham, before stealing laptops and a 42-inch plasma TV. He went on to commit six more burglaries in the first eight days of December last year, including one at the home of an 81-year-old widow, in Tyseley, Birmingham, where he stole Christmas presents and jewellery belonging to her late husband. Thompson's accomplice Tony Babington, 25, was also jailed last week after a jury found him guilty of joining him on the break-in, as well as at another in the Yardley area of Birmingham.

December 1, 2013: Thompson burgles house in Heybarnes Road, Small Heath, Birmingham. December 3, 2013: Thompson burgles house in Denham Road, Acocks Green, Birmingham. December 5, 2013: Thompson and Babington burgle house of 81-year-old widow in Spring Road, Tyseley, Birmingham. December 6, 2013: Thompson burgles house in Stuarts Road, Stechford, Birmingham. December 7, 2013: Thompson and Babington burgle house in Hob Moor Road, Yardley, Birmingham. December 7, 2013: Thompson breaks into a pawnbroker in Belchers Lane, Bordesley Green, Birmingham. Babington, of Stechford, Birmingham, was handed a mandatory three-year sentence for being a 'third strike' burglar. Thompson gained entry by kicking through UPVC door panels and, from most homes, made off with jewellery, phones and other valuables. When police analysed the tag they discovered that minutes after one burglary, Thompson went to a nearby alleyway where officers later found stolen property hidden in bushes. Data also found Thompson had entered a pawnbroker in the Bordesley Green area of the city, where officers recovered a gold bangle stolen from the break-in. CCTV from the shop also showed Babington offering the nine-carat jewellery for sale. Detectives also discovered a phone registered to Babington was used to contact a pawnbroker shortly after the 81-year-old's home was raided. A SIM card linked to Thompson was also found in a phone taken from a raid in Acocks Green, Birmingham. Chief inspector Tracey Packham, of West Midlands Police who led the GPS tag trial, said: 'The tag supports offenders who are serious about quitting crime and allows them to rebuild their life without the need to report to police stations or have the inconvenience of police officers knocking at their door late at night to check they're complying with curfews. 'The tag gives offenders more freedom as they don't need to report to police stations or have the inconvenience of police officers knocking late at night to check they're honouring curfews. 'But as Thompson has found to his cost it also affords irrefutable evidence should offenders slip back into old habits.'","Aron Thompson was one of the first UK criminals to be fitted with GPS tag .

"British households will throw away the equivalent of 4.2 million dinners on Christmas Day, according to research. The food we leave on our plates on December 25 adds up to to 263,000 turkeys, 740,000 Christmas puddings and 17.2 million Brussels sprouts across the UK, a study revealed. Figures show that nearly 10 per cent of every festive meal is thrown away, which equates to an incredible £64million of wasted food. Scroll down for video . Christmas wastage: Britons will throw away an incredible £64m in excess food on 25 December . The sprouts alone would fill 1,000 wheelie bins, while leftover carrots could reach from London to Munich, end-to-end. And unused gravy would fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool. 17.2m Brussels sprouts . 11.9m carrots . 11.3m roast potatoes . 10.9m parsnips . 9.8m cups of gravy . 7.9m slices of turkey . 7.9m cups of stuffing . 7.5m mince pies . 7.4m slices of Christmas pudding . 7.1m pigs in blankets . The poll by Unilever showed that whoever hosts Christmas lunch spends on average £112 on food alone. Typically, there are six of us around the Christmas dinner table and we're each expected to eat £18.60 worth of food. But it would take the average family nearly four days to eat everything bought just for Christmas Day. The study also found a third of British diners admit to serving themselves an excessive Christmas dinner that they can't finish. More than a third (36 per cent) of adults cite 'getting caught up in the Christmas spirit' as their excuse for buying too much food for the day. Under-35s are the worst culprits: 15 per cent  spend up to £200 on food but confess to discarding £27 worth each. One in five of us admit to buying traditional Christmas food we don't even like, the study revealed. The research was carried out as part of Unilever's Project Sunlight #ClearAPlate campaign, to show that food poverty is closer to home than many people think. Half a million meals will be provided to families in need through its partnership with Oxfam. Jon Goldstone, Unilever Foods Director, said: 'We were shocked to hear just how much food goes to waste at Christmas. 'The festive season is naturally a time when we indulge with our family and friends but throwing away 4.2 million perfectly good Christmas dinners is a staggering waste. 'Having seen these figures, this year I know I will be putting a little more thought into my Christmas shopping and through our #ClearAPlate campaign we're encouraging others to do the same.' The #ClearAPlate campaign pledges to provide an additional half a million meals to families in need through its partnership with Oxfam and calls on people to do their bit to address food waste in order to help fight hunger. People can show their support for the #ClearAPlate campaign through three simple steps: . • Clear their plate of food and take a photograph . • Upload the image on their social media using #ClearAPlate to raise awareness of the issue . •  Visit projectsunlight.co.uk to find out other ways to support the campaign, including donating meals or time to Oxfam.There are also tips and advice on reducing food waste, and recipe ideas on the site.","The figures revealed 10% of every festive dinner is thrown away, .

"A series of covert police investigations into alleged VIP paedophile rings were shut down as they went ‘to the heart of the Establishment’, officers have claimed. Serving and former detectives have vented their fury on an internet chat forum, claiming Scotland Yard investigations into child sex abuse were ‘canned’ during the 1980s and 1990s as they closed in on powerful figures, some of whom were said to be at ‘cabinet level’. As reported by Exaro, it comes as a senior MP said he was aware of six police probes into child sex abuse being shelved, five of which were run by Scotland Yard. Detectives have vented their anger on an internet chat forum where they claimed investigations into child sex abuse in the 1980s and 1990s by Scotland Yard as they closed in on powerful figures were 'canned' The extraordinary claims of a cover-up by 14 members of the forum will heap pressure on the Government and Scotland Yard, which have launched a string of probes into historic child sex abuse allegations linked to politicians. One ex-officer of 30 years’ service wrote: ‘Some very senior people have been habitually sexually assaulting the most vulnerable in society. ‘This is about kids being raped by those in power that included politicians of all sorts. It goes to the very heart of our Establishment. ‘There is very clear evidence that the general nature of the allegations are true. ‘There are enough officers on this site who have mentioned paedophile ops involving high-profile politicians being stopped at the eleventh hour.’ Labour MP John Mann yesterday admitted that he was aware of six inquiries which were shelved for 'no good reason' A former detective constable said: ‘In the 90s I uncovered a middle class paedo ring at [a police station in east London]. It linked into a massive UC [undercover] paedo job which was being run by [a named detective sergeant]. ‘The UC who shall remain nameless found that it went to cabinet level and four years of work was pulled overnight.’ Some of the officers also claimed there was a secret file dating back to the 1960s on a celebrity recently linked to historic abuse. One civil servant, who said he had signed the Official Secrets Act, wrote: ‘The cover up began in 1985 when operations were closed for no apparent reason except that prominent persons were allegedly involved and again in 1990 and again over the North Wales child abuse and successive governments have continued the practice.’ The forum is open only to those who have worked in the Metropolitan Police or closely alongside the force. The discussions surfaced in an investigation by Exaro, a news website, which was allowed access to the forum by one member. The claims were posted over a four-month period from July, when child protection campaigner Chris Fay, of the now-defunct National Association of Young People in Care, said a Special Branch detective held a gun to his head, telling him to stop investigating an alleged paedophile ring at Elm Guest House in south-west London. Yesterday Labour MP John Mann said: ‘I am aware of six inquiries that were shelved for no good reason. These officers are obviously aware of more than that. ‘It’s important that they are interviewed by the police, the Home Affairs Select Committee and the national inquiry. If these officers fail to come forward it would be a dereliction of duty.’","Serving and former detectives vented their fury on internet chat forum .

"The BBC broadcast an episode of Family Guy about Robin Williams and a failed suicide attempt just minutes before it was revealed that the actor had been found hanged. An extraordinary coincidence saw the ‘Viewer Mail #2’ episode shown on BBC Three between 11.25pm and 11.45pm on Monday - with the death announced by Reuters news agency at 11.56pm. A sketch in the episode called 'Fatman and Robin' sees Peter Griffin, the father in the US comedy, gain the power to turn everyone in his fictional city of Quahog into Williams by touching them. Scroll down for video . Robin Williams: An extraordinary coincidence saw the 'Viewer Mail #2' episode of Family Guy shown on BBC Three between 11.25pm and 11.45pm on Monday - with the death announced by Reuters at 11.56pm . Long career: Williams was found hanged in California at 11.45am local time (7.45pm BST) on Monday . Peter, whose favourite comedian is Williams, accuses God of hating the actor and wishes that everyone was him. Peter is then struck by lightning and receives the King Midas-like powers. But he is eventually overwhelmed by clones of Williams overtaking the town and tries to kill himself. Peter then decides to cut off his hands so that he can get rid of his special powers. A BBC spokesman said yesterday that the broadcast of the episode was an ‘uncanny coincidence’, but confirmed that a scheduled repeat of it for Friday will now not be shown. He said: ‘The episode ended just as the news broke about his death. This was a repeat that we have shown a couple of times before, so who could have planned that? ‘It was scheduled more than two weeks ago so it is just an uncanny coincidence. Some of our people who work here noticed that the death of Robin Williams was announced just as this episode ended.’ The spokesman added: ‘It was due to be repeated on Friday but we will not be showing it now.’ Listing: A BBC spokesman said yesterday that the broadcast of the episode was an 'uncanny coincidence', but confirmed that a scheduled repeat of it for Friday will now not be shown .

Seth MacFarlane, 40, who voices Peter, said on Twitter yesterday: ‘The world just got a lot less funny. Robin Williams is a tragic loss.’ His post was retweeted more than 10,000 times. Channel 4 News has apologised after airing a clip of Williams in Good Morning Vietnam saying: ‘Get a rope and hang me’. The programme broadcast a report about his death last night which included a clip from the 1987 film that saw him play an unorthodox DJ on US Armed Services Radio in Vietnam. The use of his quote in the clip was criticised by viewers on Twitter. Voiceover artist Trish Bertram said: ‘Slightly unfortunate choice of Robin William's Good Morning Vietnam clip by Channel 4 News for their closing tribute’. The tribute was altered when rebroadcasted on Channel 4+1 later, reported The Guardian. A spokesman said: ‘We'd like to apologise for including what was an inappropriate line from Good Morning Vietnam in our play-out from tonight's programme. There was no offence intended in what was meant to be a heartfelt tribute to Robin Williams.’ Viewers reacted in shock to the coincidence. Joe Longy tweeted: ‘So weird that the Family Guy episode about Robin Williams was on last night just before it was announced he was dead.’ And Francesca Parman said: 'Did anyone else watch the Robin Williams family guy last night? How coincidentally strange.' Viewer Mail #2 is from season ten of the popular comedy, which looks at the life of an American family and is regularly shown on BBC Three. Williams, 63, was last seen alive by his wife Susan Schneider on Sunday night before she went to bed. He was found hanged in California at 11.45am local time (7.45pm BST) on Monday. The actor shot to fame in the late 1970s as an alien in the US TV comedy series Mork & Mindy. But it was his role as an irreverent DJ with the US Armed Services Radio station in Good Morning, Vietnam in 1987 which won him huge acclaim. His roles ranged from serious and dramatic in films such as Dead Poets Society and Good Will Hunting, to comedy in Mrs Doubtfire. He was nominated for an Oscar three times before winning an Academy Award for his performance as a psychologist in Good Will Hunting in 1997.","'Viewer Mail #2' shown on BBC Three from 11.25pm to 11.45pm on Monday .

"Blow for Chris Grayling: Judges ruled a crackdown on legal aid for immigrants was 'unlawful' Judges have inflicted a humiliating blow on Justice Secretary Chris Grayling after ruling a crackdown on legal aid for immigrants was ‘unlawful’. The Court of Appeal said guidelines determining whether public money should be given to people threatened with deportation so they could fight the case were ‘too restrictive’. The guidance was wrong because it demanded a ‘very high threshold’ for handing out legal aid when someone was facing being thrown out of Britain and said funding should only be granted in cases which were ‘rare and extreme’. Lord Dyson, the Master of the Rolls, yesterday upheld a High Court decision that the rules were ‘unlawful’. The Ministry of Justice must now redraft the guidelines and reassess funding for some immigrants, including Cleon Reis, a 28-year-old Portuguese national who has committed a ‘considerable number’ of crimes. The ruling is another blow to Mr Grayling who earlier this month was told a ban on sending books to inmates in jail was unlawful. And last week a paedophile and a dangerous armed robber were controversially awarded hundreds of pounds in compensation because delays in the prison system breached their human rights. The case centres on guidelines about exceptional funding, which sets out who is still eligible to apply for legal aid in certain immigration cases following the Government's legal aid cuts. Ruling: The Master of the Rolls has upheld a decision by the High Court (above) that the rules were 'unlawful' The scheme was intended to act as a ‘safety net’ but Lord Dyson, sitting with Lord Justice Richards and Lord Justice Sullivan, said the MoJ had ordered it be applied too stringently. He said: ‘It correctly identifies many of the factors that should be taken into account in deciding whether to grant exceptional funding, but it neutralises their effect by wrongly stating that the threshold for funding is very high and that legal aid is required only in rare and extreme cases.’ The appeal court considered five cases of immigrants who had been refused legal aid under the scheme. The MoJ lost on three cases, which means the claimants must be reassessed for funding. They include Reis. He has been jailed several times, including for stealing a car and crashing it during a high-speed chase while trying to flee police. Mr Grayling introduced the crackdown on legal aid in a bid to trim the bill by £350million a year by 2015. Work to do: The Ministry of Justice must now redraft the guidelines and reassess funding for some immigrants. The MoJ's offices near St James's Park in central London are pictured . There were wide-ranging changes to the provision and scope of legal aid, including for immigration cases. Immigrants could apply for ‘exceptional case funding’ to secure legal aid but this should be withheld unless it would make challenging a deportation ruling ‘practically impossible’. Previous warning: Shadow Justice Minister Andy Slaughter (pictured) said the Government's legal aid cuts were 'rushed through before preparing the necessary evidence to justify them' In 2013-14, there were 235 applications for legal aid funding in immigration cases and only four were granted – suggesting the bar was set too high, said critics. Shadow Justice Minister Andy Slaughter said: ‘The Government's legal aid cuts were rushed through before preparing the necessary evidence to justify them. ‘Labour, alongside most of the legal profession, warned that this would raise substantial barriers to access to justice. David Cameron should listen and fix the mess he has created.’ Nicholas Lavender, chairman of the Bar Council, said: ‘People who are refused legal are being denied access to justice. ‘If, as is so often the case, they are unable to present their own case effectively, then it is simply not heard and the courts cannot do their job. This is a breach of their human rights. ‘The Government must urgently improve access to justice for these people, who are among the most vulnerable in society.’ The MoJ said it would ‘carefully consider’ its next steps following the ruling. A spokesman said: ‘We continue to believe that the exceptional funding scheme is functioning as intended. Its purpose is to provide funding where it is legally needed. ‘Legal aid is a vital part of our justice system but resources are not limitless and must be properly targeted at the cases that need it most. ‘The system must be sustainable and fair for those who use it and the taxpayers who pay for it.’","Court of Appeal says guidelines on public money are 'too restrictive'

"Former CIA Director General Michael Hayden has acknowledged the 'human toll' taken on by CIA interrogators who participated in the use of so-called 'enhanced interrogation techniques' in the years following 9/11. Speaking on ABC News,Hayden said he would be 'very, very disappointed if it did not take a human toll on CIA interrogators.' Hayden said that no matter the task at hand, the people who were doing the interrogators also had feelings. We're human too: Former CIA Director Michael Hayden acknowledges that CIA interrogators might have suffered psychological traumas by using harsh tactics . 'Because after all, although that person across the table from you was a terrorist, he's also a human being,' Hayden told ABC News. 'I would not want people in the room doing this who were not affected by this.' In something of a split within the agency, Hayden said that he was not sure he would have approved the use of waterboarding if he had authority over its use shortly after the 9/11 attacks. Hayden said use of the controversial tactic would have been a tough call. 'I don't know… It depends on the totality of circumstances at the time,' he stated. 'There are certain things that are clearly permissible and then there are a bunch of things in the middle, and I would admit that waterboarding is near the edge of that window,' he said. 'I would admit that are gray and would demand very compelling circumstances for anyone to picture themselves doing.' Looking back: Former Central Intelligence Agency Director Michael Hayden says he’s not sure he would have approved the use of waterboarding if he had authority over its use shortly after the 9/11 attacks . Last week, Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee released a lengthy and detailed report about the use of controversial interrogation techniques, including waterboarding. At one point, Hayden defended the controversial method of feeding detained enemy combatants through rectal tubes. Feeling the heat: Last week, Hayden defended the controversial method of feeding detained enemy combatants through rectal tubes . 'These were medical procedures,' he said during an interview on CNN's 'The Lead with Jake Tapper,' arguing that re-hydrating uncooperative detainees this way was safer than administering intravenous fluids. 'I'm not a doctor,' he said. 'What I am told is that this is one of the ways that the body is re-hydrated.' Hayden acknowledged that CIA interrogators might have suffered psychological traumas by using harsh tactics. The techniques were adopted by the CIA in the years following the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, D.C. in 2001. Hayden still maintains that what CIA officers carried out was not torture - and that it was legal and approved by the White House, the Attorney General and select members of Congress who were briefed on the matter. Nearly all of the horrific behavior detailed in the Senate torture report happened before Hayden was CIA Director - though he served as head of the National Security Agency from 1999 until 2005 and then Deputy Director of National Intelligence from 2005 until his 2006 appointment as the head of the CIA. Hayden, who led the CIA from 2006 to 2009, told ABC's Martha Raddatz he thought the use of EIT's was successful. 'They were successful. That's historical fact,' Hayden said. 'Do I support them? With regard to waterboarding, I've made it very clear that I thank God I didn't have to make that decision. I had easier circumstances when I was director.'","Michael Hayden has said that President George W Bush approved the torture, Congress knew about it and the Attorney General signed off on it .

"What's more annoying than when you've preened and groomed, ready to pose for that perfect portrait ... only to have it photobombed by an idiot? No wonder this hawk looks so cheesed off after a wasp flew into frame just as he was about to have his picture taken. The bird of prey looked wide-eyed and open-mouthed at  the insect  as it buzzed boldly around his head during the shoot in Seattle, Washington, looking angrier by the second. Refusing to have his moment in the spotlight ruined, the hawk then tried to eat the wasp, but it danced about his snapping beak before flying away to safety. Wasp are you doing? No wonder this hawk looks so cheesed off after a wasp flew into frame just as he was about to have his picture taken . Buzz off! The bird of prey looked wide-eyed and open-mouthed at the insect as it buzzed boldly around his head during the shoot in Seattle, Washington, looking angrier by the second . Elena Murzyn, 22, captured the image of the Cooper's hawk looking startled as the yellow and black striped insect buzzed in front of him in Seattle. The student, from Spokane, Washington, took her first photo at the age of 13 and couldn't believe her eyes when the hawk was photobombed. Elena, who also works as an animal caretaker, said: 'The Cooper's hawk in the photo is actually an imprint falconry that was raised by a falconer. 'In the photo, he is just over two months old, and due to his human-reared upbringing, talks, chirps, and screams his thoughts constantly. 'What made the photo so fantastic was seeing this incredibly talkative bird literally stop mid-scream to focus on the unexpected wasp so near his beak.

'If you look closer, you'll notice that at the moment of the photo, only one eye is actually focused on the wasp. 'The other is still in the direction he was looking a fraction of a second earlier.

Fantastic: She said, 'what made the photo so fantastic was seeing this incredibly talkative bird literally stop mid-scream to focus on the unexpected wasp so near his beak' She said: 'I did not realise I had managed to capture such a rare moment on film until I ran through the photos later that evening. 'I knew there had been a wasp buzzing around while I was out with the camera, but I told myself it was probably well out of focus and a lost chance anyway. 'The wasp was only there for a span of perhaps two seconds. 'I was tapping the next arrow repeatedly through the photos desperately trying to find one that highlighted the excellent lighting over his feathers, and deleting the ones that looked even slightly off in the same motion. 'I remember tapping past this one, getting maybe three or four past it, pausing, and tapping back slowly. 'I laughed harder in that moment than I had all week. 'That instant reaction of hilarity is why I love this photo and from what I've heard and seen, it seems to be a pretty universal reaction.'","Picture was taken by student Elena Murzyn, 22, in Seattle, Washington .

"A soap opera style dramatic divorce battle predated the recent trial of a Connecticut woman accused of hiring a hitman to kill her ex-husband in order to help her get his $50 million fortune, court documents reveal. A mistrial was recently called in the case of Tiffany Stevens, 39. Prosecutors apparently could not fully convince a jury she'd attempted to pay career felon John McDaid $5,000 to kill her millionaire ex Eric Stevens in 2012. But in making their case, the state helped reveal their turbulent marriage and mudslinging divorce that saw accusations of drug and gambling addictions lobbed, years of harassment endured by Mrs. Stevens and even an attempt by Mr. Stevens to get an insurance payout by blowing up his own car. Back and forth: A mistrial was called last week in Stevens' trial after the jury was called themselves hung. Her ex has claimed she's an unpredictable drug addict while she says he's a problem gambler who's often threatened her to the point of her getting restraining orders . The way they were: A tumultuous marriage and divorce fit for a soap opera preceded Tiffany Stevens news-hogging trial on charges she paid a handy man to murder her ex husband Eric Stevens . Stevens' husband says in 2012 she offered a local handyman 2012 to murder her husband . The Hartford Courant reports that over 200 motions have been filed or judgments made in their cantankerous relationship. They were married for just five years when divorce papers were filed in 2008 and Eric Stevens wrote: 'Wife has a new boyfriend living with her and our 4-year-old in our house. There is no chance for reconciliation.' He filed an affidavit claiming his estranged wife was a drug addict with a drug addict boyfriend. He said she would often disappear for period of time when no one knew where she was. Tiffany Stevens, in turn, hit back saying her husband was a serious gambling addict who'd racked up debt with the mafia and had even bombed his own car in order to get insurance money in order to pay back his debtors. Tiffany Stevens went on to claim that soon after the car insurance fraud her husband would report a break in at their home he used to make an insurance claim on her jewelry he said had been taken. Court documents also reveal that in June 2009, while the ongoing custody battle was just beginning, Tiffany Stevens was granted a restraining order against her ex. The order was extended multiple times. Mr. Stevens was also caught trying to bribe a pawn shop employee to illegally sell him a gun just after the order was granted. And he would serve jail time for violating the order after going against it to visit his daughter at her West Hartford school. The he said, she said frothiness of the proceedings no doubt contributed to the hung jury. A judge declared the mistrial Friday in the case of former Bloomfield resident Tiffany Stevens, who remains free on $1 million bail. The case is expected to be retried before another jury. Stevens pleaded not guilty to attempted murder on allegations she paid $5,000 to a maintenance man in Simsbury to kill Eric Stevens in 2012. Prosecutors say Tiffany Stevens was secretly recorded on audio talking about the alleged plot, but her lawyer said the recording was inconclusive and accused Eric Stevens of making up the story. New trial: The handyman, and convicted felon, John McDaid told a Connecticut court earlier this month that Tiffany Stevens, 39, offered him $5,000 to kill her ex Eric Stevens in 2012. Stevens is seen walking with her father Edward Khalily (right) on the first day of her trial in Hartford.

"A man was shocked when he checked his receipt after ordering food at a Pennsylvania bar on Saturday night and found that the server had entered the N-word where his name should be. Marquis Moore, 29, was about to enjoy an order of take-out wings from Zembie's Sports Tavern in Harrisburg when he noticed the racial slur. In the space where his name was supposed to appear on the bar tab, the N-word had been typed instead. Scroll down for video . Marquis Moore, 29, was about to enjoy an order of take-out wings from Zembie's Sports Tavern in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, when he noticed the racial slur on his receipt . 'It makes me feel like I'm just low,' Moore told The Patriot News. 'A n**** is an ignorant, disrespectful person. It has nothing to do with your skin color. What would possess you to put something like that on a piece of paper? You don't even know who I am.' The bar's owner has refused to apologize and claims the word was meant as a light-hearted joke and was a misunderstanding. Bartender Megan Bonsall told her boss, Angelo Karagiannis, that because Moore was busy talking to people at the bar she had asked a friend for his name. She claims the friend showed her Moore's Facebook page, where he described himself as a 'sexy n****.' As a result she wrote down 'n****' on the ticket as a joke. Zembie's bartender Megan Bonsall claims a 'friend' had shown her where Moore had described himself as a 'sexy n****'on Facebook and so she put it on the receipt as a joke . 'We have a Redskins fan club and every week there are 12-15 black guys who come in to watch the games. We are not racist at all and serve anyone,' Karagiannis.

"A baby who developed an enormous tumor in the womb - but was operated on and saved before birth - has lived to see his second birthday. Elijah Leffingwell, who turned two in November, developed a growth on his lung while still inside his pregnant mother, April. Surgeons said the tumor, which was three-and-a-half times larger than his head and was crushing his other organs, would surely have killed him if it had been left. Survivor: Elijah Leffingwell, now two, survived a rare lung operation from inside the womb and has celebrated his second birthday . Premature: Elijah, pictured shortly after his premature birth, struggled to eat and also had a collapsed lung when he was born and surgery carried out while he was still in the uterus removed his hefty tumor (left) from his left lung, which was crushing the rest of his organs . April and her husband Jason instead approved a rare procedure whereby the growth was cut out of Elijah while he was still in the womb - a move which gave him a 50/50 chance of survival, according to the Daily Signal. April said: 'At my 20-week ultrasound they saw that we had a tumor. Thinking that everything was perrfect then finding out that you have something so rare one in 30,000 and that the chance of survival was 50 per cent - it just crushed us.' 'The tumor kept growing and growing and growing - three and a half times the size of his head. It was just crushing him - he was going into heart failure, lung failure - and if we didn't do it, there was no chance.' The family, from De Pere, Wisconsin, moved to New Jersey so they could access the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, which had specialist surgeons who could carry out the surgery. Growing, growing: This scan of Elijah in the womb shows him next to the huge tumor - the white area - which was around the same size as the rest of him . Recovering: Due to a complication in the surgery Elijah had to eat through a tube for a year, but now thanks to therapy can take food normally - albeit with a smaller apetite . At 25 weeks Elijah underwent the surgery, during which doctors removed an orange-sized tumor from the baby's body, which scarcely weighed more than 2lbs. However, during the surgery they inadvertently pierced his diaphragm, leaving him with a hernia which caused his chest to rupture and lung to collapse. He was born prematurely, seven weeks before his due date, so he could be rushed to intensive care, having hardly met his parents. By the time he was discharged, Elijah needed to eat through a tube which pumped food directly into his stomach. Together: Elijah was born to mother April and father Jason - who went ahead with the risky surgery . Eating: Elijah eventually learned to eat like a normal child - though he has a less fierce appetite and is fed on calorie-rich food . Although the tube has now been removed, and therapy has taught him to take food through eating, Elijah doesn't have the same appetite as most children. To make up for it, his mom feeds him high-calorie food like avocados and peanut butter, and cuts his milk with whipping cream. In the long term he is not expected to suffer any lasting ill effects from his difficult birth and early years - though it seems to have given him a cautious frame of mind. April said: 'He walks through life making sure he is going to be OK.'","Elijah Leffingwell, now two, developed a fatal tumor before birth .

"Ed Miliband was facing a backbench revolt last night over Labour’s failure to support a judge-led inquiry into British complicity in torture. The party’s high command still insists a Westminster committee should investigate even though it presided over an alleged whitewash in the extraordinary rendition affair. A string of Mr Miliband’s MPs yesterday declared that disturbing questions raised by a US Senate report on the barbaric treatment of detainees by the CIA should be answered once and for all. Paul Flynn, David Winnick and Yasmin Qureshi all said only a judge-led process would do. Scroll down for video . Ed Miliband was facing a backbench revolt last night over Labour’s failure to support a judge-led inquiry into British complicity in torture . It leaves Labour’s leader in the unusual position of backing an investigation he himself admits may be inadequate. His brother David could even be called to give evidence to any inquiry. As foreign secretary from 2007 to 2010, he is accused of trying to cover up Britain’s involvement in CIA wrongdoing. Other Labour figures facing questions include Jack Straw and Tony Blair, who broke cover yesterday to say he had never condoned torture. On another day of drama at Westminster: . A string of Mr Miliband’s MPs declared only a probe by a judge could clear up the disturbing questions raised by a US Senate report on the barbaric treatment of detainees by the CIA. Both Paul Flynn (left) and David Winnick (right) said past mistakes should not be covered up . Yvette Cooper said on Sunday that she doubted Parliament’s intelligence and security committee had the capacity and the scope to carry out an inquiry and her ‘instinct’ was for a judge-led process. However, the shadow home secretary then stopped short of backing the full judicial investigation sought by MPs on all sides. Last night a source close to Mr Miliband said: ‘Ed agrees with the position set out by Yvette. The Government has outlined that the intelligence committee will be doing it, we have some concerns on it but we need to see the way the Government sets that out. As foreign secretary from 2007 to 2010, David Miliband is accused of trying to cover up Britain’s involvement in CIA wrongdoing . ‘We are not at this stage calling for anything to go further than that.’ Yesterday Mrs May said that, since her appointment in 2010, she had seen no evidence of the security services being complicit in ill treatment. But, turning the spotlight on the New Labour years, she added: ‘I cannot speak for what might have happened in the past before this Government came into office.’ Mr Clegg also spoke out, saying senior figures in the last Labour government should give evidence on what they knew. The Deputy Prime Minister added: ‘If people are found to have broken the law, the full weight of the law should come down on them without fear or favour, however operationally grand they are.’ When Mrs May appeared before the home affairs committee, Labour MPs took the opportunity to call for a judge-led investigation. Mr Flynn said it was time for Britain – which is still to publish the Chilcot report into the Iraq War – to ‘get away from this policy of trying to cover up past mistakes’. He added: ‘The (Senate torture) report degrades our reputation as allies of the United States.’ Other Labour MPs demanding a judicial inquiry included Mr Winnick and Miss Qureshi. Mr Winnick said an investigation by a judge was needed to ‘clear this whole matter up once and for all’. Keith Vaz, the committee’s chairman, stopped short of calling for a judge-led inquiry, but said it looks like being the next stage. The Labour MP added: ‘The status quo is not going to be enough.’ Mrs May came under pressure to explain the extent to which Britain had lobbied to have the Senate intelligence committee report – which detailed CIA beatings, waterboarding and the rectal feeding of detainees – redacted. It had been stripped of any mention of MI5, MI6 or Diego Garcia – the British base which David Miliband belatedly admitted had been used for at least two rendition flights. As the Mail revealed last week, there were 22 meetings between the Senate committee and British ambassadors. Mrs May also personally met its chairman Dianne Feinstein, though not on the date originally given by the Foreign Office. The Home Secretary said she had not personally asked for any of the report to be redacted, and the pair had discussed ‘other things’. A number of celebrities and politicians have signed a letter to David Cameron demanding Shaker Aamer’s release from Guantanamo Bay. The father of four is pictured here with two of his children . Other Labour figures facing questions are Jack Straw (left) and Tony Blair (right), who broke cover yesterday to say he had never condoned torture . But she conceded: ‘The UK had an opportunity to ensure there was no evidence put in which would damage our national security.’ Despite the growing clamour on all sides for a judicial inquiry, Mrs May said she also believed the intelligence and security committee should be allowed to complete the task. MPs have voiced concerns that the committee – which cleared MI5 and MI6 of involvement in extraordinary rendition in 2007 – does not have sufficient powers. ISC chairman Sir Malcolm Rifkind has said he will ask the US Senate to reveal which parts of its damning report the British Government asked to be redacted from the published version. However, other members of the UK committee have questioned why he does not simply request the information from British authorities rather than go down the time-consuming road of negotiating with the US. Mr Blair’s office issued a statement saying: ‘Tony Blair has always been opposed to the use of torture, has always said so publicly and privately, has never condoned its use and – as is shown by internal government documentation already made public – thinks it is totally unacceptable.’ The statement did not address any of the specific allegations that – during the war on terror – British agents were complicit in extraordinary rendition or had turned a blind eye to abuse of detainees. David Miliband and Mr Straw were unavailable for comment last night. Last week Ed Miliband leapt to the defence of his brother, saying he would ‘never’ have knowingly allowed British agents to become involved in rendition and torture programmes run by the CIA.","Labour high command insists Westminster committee should investigate .

"No one paid much attention to the centenary of this titanic struggle. Given that in 1915 all the main parties were preoccupied with the Great War, it was an understandable oversight. One century further on, and we have no excuse this time. So why is our educational establishment not merely playing down the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo, but ignoring it altogether? You do not have to be an old soldier or a historian to regard 1815 as one of history’s almighty milestones. The removal of Napoleon from the stage helped to redraw the map of Europe and, indeed, the world. Scroll down for video . Historical turning point: The Royal Scots clash with Napoleon's forces at the Battle of Waterloo . Not only was there sustained peace after more than 20 years of war, but the British empire would expand and consolidate its position as the globe’s pre-eminent superpower. Whether you regard that as a good thing, a mixed result or a downright abomination, it still accounts for the fact that, to this day, most of the world speaks English. But this was also, emphatically, a multi-national victory; British troops were actually outnumbered by their Dutch and German allies, so much so that Field Marshal Lord Bramall has called Waterloo ‘the first Nato operation’. An eminent consortium of academics and military experts are now putting together an impressive series of anniversary projects for next year. And this is certainly not some triumphalist dig at the French. Rather, it is all about teaching future generations to understand the importance of a battle which, as a turning point, was as fundamental as the defeat of Hitler. And the response of our educational establishment? Sorry, but we’re too busy. History enthusiasts gathered in in Plancenoit, just south of Brussels, in 2005 to reenact the famous battle on its 190th anniversary . June 18 next year will see St Paul’s Cathedral packed to the rafters. It has been booked by Waterloo 200, the charity dedicated to marking the anniversary. The great and good will be invited, of course, but so, too, will more than a thousand members of the public, particularly children from any town or village that can unearth a Waterloo connection. For the main point of the charity is to engage schools all over Britain – and Ireland. ‘We really want to get schools everywhere, particularly state schools, learning about this historical watershed,’ says a spokesman for the charity. While Waterloo 200 boasts some illustrious backers, not to mention the current Duke of Wellington and his family, it has a dedicated educational arm. A committee of experienced teachers from across the academic spectrum have drawn up a full range of educational tools and resources. And very impressive it is, too. Some 200 historical items connected to the battle – from swords to medical kits – will be distributed among schools for study and discussion. Special packs for every age range have been designed and will be freely available to any teacher. June 18 next year will see St Paul’s Cathedral packed to the rafters. It has been booked by Waterloo 200, the charity dedicated to marking the anniversary . As the charity prepares to put all this on a dedicated website, created with support from the Heritage Lottery Fund, the organisers are understandably keen to ensure that schools across the country know about all this freely available material. Hence their astonishment after writing to the Department for Education to seek a meeting with the Secretary of State, Nicky Morgan, or one of her officials to discuss it all. Back came a short letter saying that Mrs Morgan and her staff had ‘no room in the diary’. When I call her department, a spokesman refers all questions to the Department for Culture, through which Waterloo 200 received the Lottery support for its website. So there we have it. A great big – and free – educational opportunity is served up on a plate and the commissars in charge of education will not even discuss it. Next year’s restaging of Waterloo on the actual battlefield is set to feature more than 6,000 re-enactors . No doubt if this was about, say, global warming or transgender issues, officials would be falling over themselves to offer advice and outreach programmes. But a landmark in British history? Straight in the bin faster than you can say ‘National Union of Teachers’. I just wonder whether Mrs Morgan ever knew about the charity’s request in the first place. The Waterloo 200 organisers are clearly disappointed. ‘I just hope we can find other ways of ensuring that history teachers know what is available,’ says its chairman, Major General Sir Evelyn Webb-Carter. Among some historians, there is disbelief. Speaking from Paris, having just received the Grand Prix from France’s Fondation Napoleon for his new biography of the ex-emperor, the historian Andrew Roberts is dumbfounded. ‘This is a magnificent opportunity to educate young people about one of the most important episodes in our history, and yet our educators are not being told about it?’ he asks. Nicky Morgan and her staff had ‘no room in the diary’ for a meeting with Waterloo 200, the charity dedicated to marking the anniversary . Waterloo certainly has some heavyweight backers in the Cabinet, not least the Chancellor. Last year, George Osborne, a keen student of military history, announced that the Treasury would provide £1million toward the renovation of the farm at Hougoumont – a central feature of the entire battle. The Waterloo 200 organisers are not asking for major funding or even a state occasion. They are doing it themselves. All they want is a little help. This official response surely goes deeper. Is it not typical of the same pusillanimous mindset that led to the bicentenary commemorations of the Battle of Trafalgar being rewritten to avoid offending the French? Famously, Britain’s grand re-enactment of the battle in 2005 did not involve British or French forces, but a ‘blue’ fleet and a ‘red’ fleet. There are already reports that next year’s restaging of Waterloo on the actual battlefield, with more than 6,000 re-enactors, will involve a French ‘win’ on one day and an allied victory the next. Not exactly, says organiser, Etienne Claude. ‘One day will focus on the French cavalry and one day will focus on the allied infantry,’ he explains. ‘And a lot of it will be about life among the bivouacs and so on.’ In other words, there will be no great winners or losers – although the Germans are said to be very excited about it. At long last, they can look forward to a major European military anniversary where they are cast as the good guys.","June 18 next year will be the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo .

"They are a popular addition to many seafood dishes. But the world's scallops and oysters are mysteriously dying out, new figures have revealed. The creatures, which have been successfully farmed in pristine, deep water sounds off Vancouver Island in British Columbia since the 1970s, are now being killed off in dramatic numbers. This is causing suppliers in area - once responsible for nearly two-fifths of Canada’s farmed shellfish - to warn of shortages and producers to worry about the future of their businesses. Decline: British Columbia was once responsible for nearly two-fifths of Canada’s farmed shellfish. But as the area's scallops and oysters are mysteriously dying out, it now supplies only 20 per cent of the country's total . Dying out: Oysters and scallops, which have been successfully farmed in pristine, deep water sounds off Vancouver Island in British Columbia since the 1970s, are now being killed off in dramatic numbers . Alarmingly, scientists do not know what the culprit is behind the mass die-offs. However, the increasing acidification of the ocean has been widely cited as the main suspect. In the past two years, eight to nine-tenths of baby oysters have died in Desolation Sound farms - a shocking rise from the normal mortality rate of around 50 per cent, The Globe and Mail reported. 'It’s a remote area, the water is clean... we haven’t had any environmental concerns, so I’m not sure what’s going on,' Yves Perreault, who annually harvests half a million oysters at the farms, said. 'To be frank, we don’t know a lot about it and that’s what’s scary.' Meanwhile, scallop farmers off Vancouver Island have reported hatchling die-offs since 2010. Earlier this year, one-third of the workforce (20 employees) at Island Scallops were laid off because the business  lost more than 10 million scallops before they reached maturity. When asked if he had ever seen such a mass die-off before, Rob Saunders, CEO of Island Scallops, told CDC: 'Nothing like this - continual mass mortality.' Rise: The increasing acidification of the ocean has been widely cited as the main suspect in the mass die-offs. Above, the falling pH levels in the sea are directly linked to the rising levels of CO2 in the atmosphere . Making cuts: Earlier this year, one-third of the workforce at Island Scallops (pictured, employees farming shellfish) were laid off because the business lost more than 10 million scallops before they reached maturity . Some people have pointed to warming coastal waters as a potential reason for the shocking figures. This shift in temperature is altering the timing of zooplankton blooms, which the shellfish feed off. Others believe changes in the environment have worsened the devastation caused by an oyster herpes virus, which has been wiping out oysters in France and Australia, Quartz reported. The virus has killed 26 percent of France’s oyster production since  2008, while it was reportedly responsible for the deaths of a staggering 10 million oysters in three days in Australia. And some, including Mr Perreault, have suggested that there may be too many scallops and oysters in the waters off Vancouver Island, and not enough food to feed them, putting them under stress. Affected: When asked if he had ever seen such a mass die-off of scallops before, Rob Saunders (pictured), CEO of Island Scallops, told CDC : 'Nothing like this.' He added that he is convinced the ocean is more acidic . However, the main culprit in the mass die-offs of scallops and oysters is believed to be the ocean's acidification, with the pH levels at Vancouver Island having fallen drastically in recent years. The levels slipped from an average of 8.1 in 1974 to 7.2 by 2001 (a pH of below 7 - on a scale of 0-14 - is considered acidic), according to The Vancouver Aquarium. This is increasingly depriving baby shellfish of the carbonate ions they need to grow tough shells, which could leave them more vulnerable to parasites and disease, experts claim. Mr Saunders said: 'I’m convinced the ocean is getting much more acidic, and much more acidic than anyone anywhere believed it could happen that fast.' According to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the falling pH levels in the ocean are directly linked to the rising levels of CO2 in the atmosphere. As carbon dioxide levels increase, so do those in the ocean, altering the seawater’s chemistry. Sophia Johannessen, a research scientist, said it is clear oceans are becoming more acidic - but that more research needs to be done into the oyster and scallop die-offs to confirm a link. Helen Gurney-Smith, of Vancouver Island University, agreed that further research is urgently needed to keep the shellfish industry afloat - adding that it is a 'global', not national problem. Every year, Canada produces more than 12,000 tonnes of oysters, worth a staggering $18million. British Columbia was formerly responsible for 40 per cent of the country's shellfish crop. Now, it supplies just 20 per cent.","Scallops and oysters are dying in drastic numbers off Vancouver Island .

"An Italian man left unable to speak or communicate properly following a head injury took doctors by surprise by ‘waking up’ and talking to his family normally after being given a common anti-anxiety drug. The 43-year-old man, who doctors have named SV, suffered a traumatic head injury during a car accident two years ago. He was left in a coma for 40 days, and then in a vegetative state – where he was awake but showing no signs of awareness – for four weeks. A 43-year-old Italian man who was left unable to speak or communicate after a head injury amazed doctors by 'waking up' when he was given the common anti-anxiety drug midazolam. Tests revealed the drug had triggered changes in two networks of the brain responsible for responding to tasks and language . One year on after the accident, SV’s condition had deteriorated. He could only think and move slowly, and was completely dependent on others for all daily tasks necessary for living. Throughout the next year, his family noticed even more of a decline. He didn’t speak or communicate in any way, and didn’t answer simple requests like ‘close your eyes’. He would carry out what doctors called ‘aimless repetitive behaviours’ like clapping, but wouldn’t respond to other stimulus from doctors or his family. Doctors tested a few different drugs, hoping to help him communicate again. After nothing seemed to work, they stopped giving medicine. He was diagnosed as being in a ‘minimally conscious state’, meaning he was awake, but was unable to communicate and needed constant care. One day SV was send for a routine CT scan - a test which uses X-rays and a computer to create detailed images the brain – his doctors decided to give him common anti-anxiety drug midazolam to sedate him. What happened next amazed doctors. Instead of making the man drowsy for the procedure, the drug ‘woke him up’ and he started to chat to the anaesthetists and then his parents. Midazolam is in the family of drugs called ‘benzodiazepines’. It works in the brain to cause sleepiness, muscle relaxation, and short-term memory loss, and to reduce anxiety. Midazolam can cause severe breathing problems when used for sedation for conditions that do not require urgent medical attentions. It can stop the lungs working properly, which could result in brain damage or death if not treated properly. He spoke to his aunt on the phone, recognised the road to his home and even congratulated his brother when he was told he had graduated. His family asked him about his accident, but he couldn’t remember anything and was unaware he’d been unable to speak until now. Two hours later the drugs wore off and SV returned to his previous, minimally conscious state. A few weeks later doctors gave him the anti-anxiety drug again, and this time monitored his behaviour and also looked at EEG recordings of his brain - a scan which picks up brain impulses. Once again SV started to chat and interact, and could even carry out basic maths, before losing the ability to speak when the drugs wore off. Doctors said SV was ‘able to understand verbal commands and to perform any type of response required, either behavioural or verbal,’ after being given the drug. When they studied the EEG recordings of his brain impulses, they found the drug had triggered a change in the brainwave activity in two parts of the brain. The first was the part of the brain called the task-positive network, which helps us respond to tasks that require our attention. The second was the part of the brain responsible for speaking and understanding language. Writing in the journal Restorative Neurology and Neuroscience, where the doctors documented SV’s case, they said this is the first described in medical literature where a patient has ‘woken up’ after being given the drug midazolam. Midazolam is from the family of drugs called benzodiazepines. Doctors said its use in patients with minimal consciousness - who are unable to communicate - should be investigated. A midazolam molecule is pictured . They said they suspected SV may have catatonia – a symptom of medical conditions like schtitzophrenia and depression - which leaves a seemingly-awake person unresponsive to stimulus. This is because patients with catatonia are also responsive to benzodiazepines, the family of drugs which includes midazolam. However, they theorized that perhaps some patients in a ‘minimally conscious state’ also show symptoms of catatonia, leaving them unable to move. Either way, they concluded that treatment with midazolam should be explored for such patients. They could be given a continuous infusion of the drug midazolam, which is commonly done in intensive care units for people undergoing long-lasting seizures, they said. However, it is not clear what SV's long-term's fate was.","A 43-year-old Italian man was left needing daily care after a head injury .

"Stephen Fry has revealed he heard ‘horrifying screams’ as his nightclub boss neighbour was killed. David West, 70, a flamboyant self-styled ‘lord’, died of a single knife wound at his £2.5million home in Mayfair, central London, on Friday. His son has been charged with his murder after allegedly stabbing him in a drunken row. Shock: Stephen Fry (left) has revealed he heard ‘horrifying screams’ as his nightclub boss neighbour David West (right) was killed in Mayfair, central London, on Friday night . Nightclub owner David West, centre, was found stabbed to death at his home in Mayfair on Friday night . The divorced father of three, who bought the title ‘Lord of the Manor of Hollesley’ on eBay, worked closely with his son, also called David West, 44. Police were called to a building where the men lived in adjacent flats at 6pm on Friday. West Jr was arrested nearby and is due to appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court today. Comedian Fry, 57, told The Sun reporters Tom Morgan and Shaun Wooller last night: ‘I was at home on Friday night when I heard these horrifying screams and wondered what was going on. ‘I looked out the window and saw Dave’s body taken out of his home and placed on the road. The emergency services were desperately trying to revive him but were unfortunately unable to do so.’ Yesterday friends paid tribute to the man dubbed ‘king of the booze cruise’ who made millions flogging £1-a-bottle wine and cigarettes to coaches of Brits. A post-mortem examination revealed that a single stab wound was the cause of Mr West's death . David West, pictured in a pink suit with his Bentley, owned a popular Mayfair nightclub and restaurant . The cockney, known for his £5,000 Italian pink suits, mullet haircut and crocodile skin shoes, rose from barrow boy to head a £100million empire and once tried to sue David and Victoria Beckham for slander for saying he was not welcome at their World Cup party despite paying £100,000 for a ticket. West said they did not want him at the 2006 ball, banned him from carrying a mobile phone and told him his pink suit was against the dress code. A High Court judge threw out the case, however. A year later, he hired barrister Cherie Blair to fight the public smoking ban – then a flagship policy of her husband Tony Blair’s government. The prime minister’s wife was taken to West’s erotic nightclub Hey Jo, named after his 21-year-old girlfriend Joanna Dudzik – who he lavished £400,000 on, then took to the High Court to try to curb her spending. Mrs Blair’s tour of the £4million club, with its explicit decor, ‘bondage booth’ and waitresses dressed as nurses, caused a sensation. The pensioner, originally from Romford, Essex, started his career as a market trader in the East End . The 70-year-old's son, also called David West, has been charged with his murder and is due in court on Monday . He owned Mayfair night club HeyJo (pictured) and the Abracadabra restaurant, both located on Jermyn Street . Traces of polonium-210 were later found in the club after two ex-KGB agents wanted for the murder of Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko visited in 2007. West, from Romford, Essex, started as an East End market trader before he and his wife Kathy opened greasy spoon cafes in Belgium and Calais. His firm, EastEnders, became part of Europe’s largest British-owned cash-and-carry group – with its own wine label, The Dogs B*******. His 30-year marriage failed in 1999 when he took up with a 23-year-old French blonde, quickly followed by a series of young girlfriends. West admitted trawling Russian bride websites and at one stage shared his flat with three Estonian girls. He ran a talent firm, a restaurant called Abracadabra and a Mayfair lapdancing club, Puss In Boots. He also owned 4 Star Hostel, a women’s guesthouse near Piccadilly Circus, and gentlemen’s club Mandy’s. Last night his business associate Harry Barnett, 72, who was friends with West for 60 years, said: ‘I can’t believe it. They were very close. As well as HeyJo (pictured) he also is believed to have owned a gentleman's club called Mandy's . Mr West lived in a three-bedroom house in Ormond Yard, where police and paramedics were called on Friday . ‘Dave lived with his dad all his life, apart from when he was married. It’s his other son, James, I feel for now. He is in bits.’ At his home in Brentwood, Essex, West’s youngest son James said: ‘We want to keep it a private matter.’ West once said of his children: ‘I gave them some money – enough to start their own businesses – and waved them off. ‘They drive the flash cars and wear all the trendy designer gear, but I have to hope we’ve brought them up right. The best thing in the world would be for me to see them making a go of a business. It’s all I ever wanted, and it’s all I’ve ever done.’ Last night friends remembered West online. Mickey Helliet said: ‘Really going to miss him, a real character.’ Jelena Gauthier said: ‘Such a gracious host, flamboyant man and a playful soul.’ Alex Mills, who starred in The Apprentice last year, tweeted: ‘Terribly sad news.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","David West, 70, died of a single knife wound at his £2.5million home .

"They promise a perfect smile at a fraction of the price of professional treatments. But cheap tooth-whitening methods and DIY remedies can do permanent damage, a dentist warns. Some are so harsh they strip away the enamel, leaving healthy young people with dull brown teeth usually only seen in the elderly. Warning: A leading cosmetic dentist has warned people against cheap tooth-whitening methods and DIY remedies as they can do permanent damage . Ken Harris, a leading cosmetic dentist, said: ‘You only get so much enamel in your life and once it has gone, you are in serious trouble.’ Tooth-whitening has become increasingly popular as Britons seek the Hollywood smile sported by celebrities. But with professional whitening costing up to £700, Dr Harris said he has seen patients go to extreme lengths to cut costs – from scrubbing their teeth with Vim scouring powder to rinsing with Toilet Duck or Domestos. He said they are so desperate for white teeth they ignore warnings on cleaning products saying they are not to be taken internally. Rinsing with Domestos and Toilet Duck causes chemical burns, while Vim scratches tooth enamel. Dr Harris said: ‘People want white teeth and will move hell and high water in an attempt to get them.’ Others are putting their faith in cut-price treatments offered by beauticians and hairdressers or in kits bought at their local chemist. Dispelling the myth: Lleading cosmetic dentist Ken Harris insists strawberries do not whiten teeth . Dr Harris, who studied tooth-whitening for a master’s degree, warned that the budget bleaching sessions are at best useless and at worst dangerous. His research shows that only hydrogen peroxide and derivatives of it, such as carbamide peroxide, whiten teeth. However, some beauticians use chlorine dioxide, which is better known as swimming pool bleach. It eats away at the enamel, exposing the dentine below, which looks brown. Dr Harris, of Riveredge Cosmetic Dentistry in Sunderland, also warns against buying kits online. Some contain five times as much carbamide peroxide as needed. They will whiten teeth but also leave them extremely sensitive. Dr Harris said kits sold in chemists are not harmful but simply do not work as the law bans them from containing hydrogen peroxide. Some people are under the impression that the citric acid in strawberries and lemon juice whitens teeth. Strawberries do not whiten teeth, while too much lemon juice just damages enamel. Martin Fallowfield, of the British Dental Association, called the use of swimming pool bleach as a whitener ‘very scary’. He said it is illegal for anyone other than a dentist to whiten teeth – but some beauticians try to get around this by helping customers with the treatment rather than fully carrying it out.","Tooth-whitening now very popular with people looking for Hollywood smile .

"An Arizona bridge famously bought from London in the 1960s suffered significant damage when a van crashed into the railing in Friday. Workers in Lake Havasu City are repairing 40 feet part of the landmark London Bridge after the incident this weekend. Jose Lopez, 33, lost control of his truck  and drove up onto a curb and struck the bridge, police say. An Arizona bridge famously bought from London in the 1960s suffered significant damage when a van crashed into the railing in Friday . Workers in Lake Havasu City are repairing 40 feet part of the landmark London Bridge after the incident this weekend . Maintenance staff began working Saturday to replace 40 feet of granite railing. Police say weather may have contributed to the incident as roads were slippery because of rain, but fortunately Mr Lopez was not injured. City officials say this is the third time the bridge has been damaged in a vehicle-related incident. The bridge was bought by Lake Havasu City founder Robert McCulloch 46 years ago, for $2,460,000 (£1,029,000). The bridge was bought by Lake Havasu City founder Robert McCulloch 46 years ago, for $2,460,000 (£1,029,000) McCulloch shipped about 30,000 tons of bridge to Arixona and had it rebuilt on dry land . London Bridge had begun to sink due to the amount of people crossing it on foot, about one inch every eight years, so the City of London put it up for sale. McCulloch shipped about 30,000 tons of bridge to Arixona and had it rebuilt on dry land. Only once it had been erected were the sands dug up to allow the water to pass under it. The bridge was completed in 1971 as part of a larger  tourist attraction called 'English Village', complete with a mock-Tudor mall.","A van crashed into bridge famously transported from London to U.S.

"With a net worth of £3billion, there are plenty of things Sir Richard Branson can buy with his money. But his plans to explore the depths of the ocean have had to be put on hold, almost four years after the entrepreneur unveiled the Virgin Oceanic DeepFlight Challenger submarine in April 2011. Sir Richard, 64, originally wanted the 18ft-long vessel to make its first voyage 36,000ft down to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean’s Mariana Trench - the lowest known point on Earth - before 2012. Scroll down for video . On hold: Sir Richard Branson unveiled the Virgin Oceanic DeepFlight Challenger submarine in April 2011 . Around the world: After the 36,000ft Pacific dive, the plan was for the craft to move on to Atlantic's 28,000ft deep Puerto Rico trench, followed by Arctic, Indian and Southern ocean dives . But the idea - ‘the last great challenge for humans’, in his words - has been mothballed, two months after Virgin Galactic’s future was put in doubt after the craft crashed on a test flight. After the Pacific dive, the plan was for the craft to move on to Atlantic's 28,000ft deep Puerto Rico trench, followed by Arctic, Indian and Southern ocean dives, reported The Sunday Telegraph. Virgin Oceanic - which had launched under the promise of ‘five dives, five oceans, two years, one epic adventure’ - was said to have planned to charge ‘aquanauts’ up to £300,000 for the trip. But the DeepFlight company told Telegraph reporters Robert Mendick and Dominic Nicholls that the submarine could only be used for one dive because of the huge pressure on its structure. Tests found its cockpit showed signs of cracking under the simulated pressure of a 38,000ft depth. And in a statement on Virgin group's website in August, when he admitted defeat for the moment, Sir Richard said: ‘We are still highly passionate about exploring the bottom of the ocean. Underwater: It was hoped by Sir Richard that his deep sea exploration would break as many as 30 Guinness World Records, including the five deepest dives in history . Down it goes: On his planned journeys to the bottom of the sea, Sir Richard was expecting to spend up to 12 hours in complete darkness and freezing cold in the submarine's tiny cockpit . ‘However, we are now widening the focus of the project and looking for new technology to help us explore the ocean and democratise access at reduced cost and increased safety.’ Virgin then confirmed last week that the project had been ‘put on ice while we look at other technology that works’, adding that it was hopeful of reviving it at some point. Virgin spokesman Nick Fox told MailOnline today: 'Richard is planning to develop a submarine technology that will reach the bottom of the ocean multiple times. In an ideal world this sub would take a pilot and two passengers. ‘We remain committed to the exploration of the deep seas but it will take time to find and develop the right robust technology to reach the bottom of the ocean with the same craft many times.’ It was thought the deep sea exploration could have broken as many as 30 Guinness World Records, including the five deepest dives in history. On his planned journeys to the bottom of the sea, father-of-two Sir Richard was expecting to spend up to 12 hours in complete darkness and freezing cold in the submarine's tiny cockpit. Successful: Two years ago, Hollywood director James Cameron made it down to the Mariana Trench in a solo descent in the Deepsea Challenger submarine, taking more than two hours to reach the bottom . Fatal crash: Virgin Galactic's experimental space craft disintegrated over the Californian desert when its feathering system deployed prematurely and aerodynamic forces tore it apart . The eight-foot long craft, made of carbon fibre and titanium, had stubby wings and a cockpit. It was said that it could cruise for about six miles and stay submerged without help for 24 hours. Sir Richard had planned to take it in turns with US sailor Chris Welch to pilot the submarine. Mr Welch is carrying on with the project and Sir Richard has the option to do a dive with him. Two years ago, Hollywood director James Cameron made it down to the Mariana Trench in a solo descent in the Deepsea Challenger submarine, taking more than two hours to reach the bottom. That was only the second manned expedition to the depths - the first was in 1960 when US Navy Lt Don Walsh and Swiss oceanographer Jacques Piccard spent 20 minutes on the ocean floor. In October, Virgin Galactic's experimental space craft disintegrated over the Californian desert when its feathering system deployed prematurely and aerodynamic forces tore it apart. Co-pilot Michael Alsbury was killed in the accident and pilot Peter Siebold was seriously injured but managed to escape after activating his parachute system.","Entrepreneur unveiled Virgin Oceanic DeepFlight Challenger sub in 2011 .

A subtitling error spotted by many viewers on Friday evening on the hour at around 7pm saw the channel declare: ‘Welcome to the year of the whores.

Error: A subtitling error spotted by many viewers on Friday evening on the hour at around 7pm saw the channel declare: 'Welcome to the year of the whores.

"George Osborne and David Cameron launched a double assault on the Labour party yesterday, saying their addiction to borrowing and refusal to cut welfare would cripple the economy. In separate speeches, the Chancellor and the Prime Minister warned that the party would always put off difficult decisions on Britain's debts – with Mr Osborne accusing them of taking a 'manana' approach. Mr Cameron painted a bleak picture of Britain under Labour, saying its plans would cause 'utter chaos… the chaos of higher taxes, fleeing businesses, jobs lost, an economy stagnating ... the chaos of public services that can't meet demand and are creaking under pressure'. Speaking in New York, his Chancellor said Labour's plans would allow it to go on piling up debts to dangerous levels. Mr Cameron painted a bleak picture of Britain under Labour, saying its plans would cause 'utter chaos' But their attack on Labour's economic credibility suffered a setback last night when Ed Miliband's party said it would sign up to the Coalition's new Charter of Budget Responsibility, which will require the next government to start bringing day-to-day spending under control. The Chancellor added that a Tory government would also start paying down Britain's towering debts by 2019 – a pledge that Labour and the Lib Dems have refused to match . The Chancellor added that a Tory government would also start paying down Britain's towering debts by 2019 – a pledge that Labour and the Lib Dems have refused to match. He added: 'If after seven years of growth we don't start reducing our debt, round the world people will ask, 'if not now, then when?' Manana is not a credible fiscal plan.' The Spanish phrase 'manana' refers to putting off a difficult task until tomorrow. Mr Cameron sought to drive the message home with a warning that Labour's plans represented a 'massive gamble' with the economy. He said the Tories would take a further £12billion out of welfare spending, while Labour would not cut benefits by a single penny. In a speech in Dorset, he went on: 'Every pound you don't save on welfare is a pound you might have to take out of the services we need, like the NHS and schools. If we don't make these savings now, it would be a lot worse later.' He told reporters there were still 'signs of excess' in the welfare budget despite a string of cuts, all of which have been opposed by Labour. But Mr Osborne was left licking his wounds last night when the intended trap for Labour backfired. The Chancellor hoped the party would refuse to back the new Charter of Budget Responsibility – thereby creating a clear dividing line on the economy ahead of the election. But, in a surprise move, the Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said Labour would support the plans to balance the government's day-to-day spending by 2018 – even though he previously rejected setting a target date. The Tories said the move effectively committed Labour to matching its goal of finding £30billion of savings. But Labour claimed the new law – which MPs will vote on before the election – was broadly in line with its own plans. Mr Balls said: 'This Charter is consistent with our position.' In fact, Conservative aims go much further than the Charter requires. The Tories have pledged to balance the whole budget by 2019, including the £28billion spent on capital projects, such as new roads. They also plan to run a budget surplus of £23billion by 2020. However Labour has described the cuts required to achieve this as 'extreme and ideological'. And a ComRes poll for the Independent last night suggested the public was sceptical about the idea. The survey found that 30 per cent of people want to balance the budget even if it means deep cuts to services, while 66 per cent oppose the idea.","PM and Chancellor say Labour addiction to borrowing will cripple economy .

"Tragic: Lucia Rodrigo, 16, was found dead along with her horse after it suffered a heart attack, breaking its neck and died on the spot . The family, friends and classmates of a South Florida teenager who was found dead along with a horse she was riding, took part in a memorial ride this weekend. 100 riders from South Florida's equestrian community saddled up for a two-mile ride on Sunday morning to celebrate the life of 16-year-old Maria Lucia Rodrigo. The teenage rider was a student at Cypress Bay High School. Police found the bodies of Rodrigo and the horse she was riding just after 4 p.m. on Thursday last week. 'She was always there helping us,' said classmate Ana Sofia to WSVN, 'and it's really sad to know that this happened, because you really don't know what can happen next.' 'She was a good girl,' said another classmate. 'She didn't deserve this, neither did the family.' Wendy Morell, the horses owner, said that a necropsy performed at the University of Florida's College of Veterinary Medicine in Gainesville confirmed the horse suffered a heart attack and then a broken neck as a result of a fall. According to the owners of Brownie, the 18-year-old male quarter horse, Rodrigo rode him many times prior to the incident. 'She rode the horse quite a bit. The horse was very well broke. He done a lot of parades. His heart could've gave out and he just dropped quick. I heard it was quick,' said Terry Sheer, a family friend. Riding: A remembrance trail ride was held on Sunday for a Lucia Rodrigo who was discovered dead next to her horse in Southwest Ranches . Fond farewell: Rodrigo's friends and classmates at Cypress Bay High School in Weston said she will be missed . Mystery: Witnesses said they saw Rodrigo riding her horse, Brownie, at full speed along the canal shortly before they were found dead. It still isn't known how they died for certain . Rodrigo went for a short ride but did not return. 'She was just supposed to go around the block and come right back,' Sheer said. 'We all were going to Santa's Enchanted Forest, and we don't know why she went over to Griffin and ran the horse. We have no idea. We didn't even believe that was her, because she was supposed to be right back.' A woman who helped teach Lucia how to ride said she believes the horse may have suffered an aneurysm and died on the spot, throwing Lucia off. 'This is a tragedy, a sad thing,' said Elsy Altuve, a rider who came from her home in Miami to attend the event. 'No matter how long you have had horses, how well you ride, there is always an inherent risk,' she told the Sun Sentinel. The memorial ride was organized via Facebook by Alexis DeVarona, 19, a Davie resident who attends Broward College. She said she did not know Rodrigo, but was moved by the tragedy. 'We in the horse community need to come together more,' she said. 'And safety is so important.' Investigation: The teen was found on a riding path in Southwest Ranches, Broward County, Florida on Thursday December 4th. She was found near her horse Brownie (pictured) Community commemration: On Sunday, local horseback riders gathered to bid farewell to Lucia and her horse known as 'Brownie' who also died . Lovely girl: Lucia was part of the honor society and is described as always having a smile on her face . Coming together: Friends say Lucia was an experienced rider who had been riding Brownie for several years . A friend of Lucia's said that she saw the teenager galloping along one of the riding paths. 'Horses were her favorite thing. It was her favorite hobby, her favorite thing to do,' Danielle De Varona said to NBC 6. Friends say she was an experienced rider who had been riding Brownie for several years. 'Lucia was a very good rider, she liked to go a little fast like all of us do every now and then, cause the horses like to do it too,' Diana McClure said. 'You know, we all are out here every weekend and during the week when we can and it's just really surprising, especially for both of them, for the horse and the rider to go down at the same time,' said Tina Valenchis. 'It's very unfortunate but we all have to tell ourselves she is in a better place now and she has wings now and she can fly like the angel that she is,' said McClure. Forever remembered: The South Florida Trail Riders Organization created a plaque in Rodrigo's memory . Sadness: In their honor, dozens of riders organized a trail ride from Robbins Lodge to Tree Tops Park in Davie . Thinking of the family: Investigators are trying to gather details as to how they died . The medical examiner is attempting to determine the exact cause of death but it may be several weeks before anything definitive is known. The results of an autopsy on Rodrigo have not been made public. But police and many riders have speculated that she was fatally injured when Brownie went down. 'It's a traumatic and tragic occurrence and unfortunately a young adult was killed,' said Southwest Ranches Mayor Jeff Nelson, 'Our thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends.' According to the owners of Brownie, the 18-year-old male quarter horse, Rodrigo rode him many times prior to the incident. Brownie wasn't easily spooked, but the owners believe he could have suffered a heart attack .

"Thousands of images depicting U.S. soldiers abusing prisoners in Iraq and Afghanistan may be released this week following the Senate's 'torture report'. The images, part of a collection from 203 investigations into detainee abuse by U.S. military, are said to depict horrifying methods of torture. One photo reportedly shows an American soldier raping a female prisoner, while other pictures allegedly depict sexual assaults on prisoners with truncheons, wire and a phosphorescent tube. President Obama, pictured last week, is under pressure to release the photos, some of which he initially blocked in 2009, claiming they could pose a risk to soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan . Some of the photographs were initially set to be released in 2009, but were blocked after President Obama backtracked, stating that it could pose a safety risk to troops on the ground. In May 2009, Obama claimed publishing the pictures would inflame anti-American feeling in Iraq and Afghanistan. 'We're not dismissive of the fact that some people could react badly to the publishing of the photographs,' American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Jameel Jaffer told The Daily Beast. 'But this does not mean that there should be a massive heckler's veto that terrorist organizations can wield over the public's right to know.' 'The public has a right to know what happened in these military detention facilities,' Jaffer added, 'in the same way it has a right to know about what happened at the CIA black sites.' The US government have until Friday to submit their evidence to Alvin Hellerstein, senior judge of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The images are part of a collection from 203 investigations into detainee abuse in U.S. military prisons such as the notorious Abu Ghraib (pictured) and are said to depict horrifying methods of torture . Under pressure: President Obama pose with his wife Michelle and daughters Sasha and Malia and children dressed like elves at the National Building Museum in Washington on Sunday . The evidence must support why each individual image should be kept from the public. The possible release of the photographs is part of a long-running Freedom of Information Act lawsuit brought the US government by the American Civil Liberties Union. The release last week of a Senate report cataloging years of such interrogation tactics has revived debate about legal opinions since discredited and withdrawn and about the decision to not prosecute the program's architects or officers who used the methods. Civil rights groups in the United States and abroad are renewing calls to prosecute those who relied on techniques that President Barack Obama has called torture. 'How can we seriously use the phrase 'rule of law' if crimes of this magnitude go uninvestigated and unprosecuted?' Jameel Jaffer said. The Justice Department, which spent years looking into the matter, says it lacks sufficient evidence to convict anyone and found no new information in the report. It also is far from clear that any international case could be brought. Department officials said they will not revisit their 2012 decision to close the investigation, citing among other challenges the passage of time and the difficulty of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that crimes were committed, especially in light of government memos that gave interrogators extraordinary latitude. 'Our inquiry was limited to a determination of whether prosecutable offenses were committed. Importantly, our investigation was not intended to answer the broader questions regarding the propriety of the examined conduct,' the department said in a statement after the report was released.","'Thousands' of photos of torture in U.S. military prisons could be released .

Another eager letter writer has made Santa's job even easier this year, listing just one simple item on his Christmas list: a magazine. Other children are happy to give old Saint Nick the chance to be a bit creative with his gift giving, asking him to choose something that he thinks they might like. 'St Nicholas (Santa),' young Bianca writes. 'I want to wish you a Merry Christmas... May I have two packs of gum and other sorts of stuff.' She signs off at the end of the letter: 'Love you silly boy.' Strict instructions: Some of the letters featured incredibly detailed suggestions about how Santa might best go about delivering the gifts . We just can't Let It Go: Frozen merchandise featured prominently on a number of lists, including this letter which includes an Elsa doll and an Elsa water gun . 'I have been very good': Many of the children are sure to explain to Santa that their behavior throughout the year has been well above average . Then there are the children whose letter come with very strict instructions about how Santa should deliver their gifts - and there are even those who include warnings about what will happen to him should he fail to get them what they ask for. One child explains: 'Dear Santa Claus, I have a stocking. It is new. If you bring a lot of stuff, use the big stocking. If you bring not so much, use the little one.' Unsurprisingly, merchandise from Disney's hit animated movie Frozen was high on a lot of children's lists, with Princess Elsa dolls, Anna costumes and Olaf teddies all included in this year's letters to the North Pole. Rather surprisingly, a number of the letters featured don't include any requests at all - but rather include lovely stories and anecdotes which the authors wanted to share with Santa in order to brighten up his holiday - or in some cases to explain away any bad behavior which might land them on the naughty list. Feed the world: Young Mia wants nothing more than to ensure anyone without food is given some this Christmas . Spinning a small tale: One young girl just wanted to share her thoughts on her Elf on the Shelf, named Chippy, and thank Santa for allowing him to stay with her . Fight club: Although this youngster admits to fighting with her brother Taj on occasion, she insists that, underneath it all, they love each other dearly . 'Dear Santa Claus, I am very happy with Chippy, he is the best elf ever in my opinion,' one child wrote, referring to the popular Christmas toy the Elf on the Shelf. 'He is very fun. Thank you for letting me have him. 'Every morning I have fun looking for him. He is a sneaky elf and I like that... 'He is not too hard to find and not to easy, he is just right.' Another child adds: 'Dear Santa Claus, how are your reindeer? How are you feeling? I have been very good this year. Sometimes Taj and I fight but we love each other!'","Parents have been posting images of the letters on Instagram, using the hashtag #lettertosanta .

"Ukip leader Nigel Farage has revealed his 'big regret' in life was spending too much time on politics – and not being able to see his daughters grow up. Mr Farage makes the admission in an booze-fuelled interview with Gogglebox 'posh couple' Steph and Dom Parker. The controversial politician is set to appear in a special Channel 4 spin-off from the popular show tonight – where he is interviewed at home with Mr and Mrs Parker. Scroll down for video . Over several pints of beer, glasses of champagne and port Mr Farage disclosed he had not spent enough time with his youngest children . Over several pints of beer, glasses of champagne, red wine, port, and alcohol-laced coffee, Mr Farage disclosed he had not spent enough time with his youngest children. He also admitted that he would never be Prime Minister – and did not want to be either. The Ukip leader said he prefered to 'do something' rather than 'be something'. Mr Farage has two sons in their 20s from his first marriage and two younger daughters from his second. He also claimed that he was 'poor' – despite earning around £80,000 a year. But he said this was 'about half of what the local headmaster or GP earns'. But when asked about his children, he admitted: 'I've got regrets about that. Big regrets. 'My first marriage - I got divorced in the 90s - I spent loads of time with my kids, the boys, as they were growing up. 'I worked in the City so 5, 6 o'clock on Friday it was over, didn't start again until Monday morning. 'So I had time for the kids as they were growing up, the boys. And I guess my daughters have seen less of me than they probably should have done.' Mr Farage, the Ukip leader, also admitted that he would never be Prime Minister – and did not want to be either . Nigel Farage insisted he had no regrets about going into politics - but claimed it had left him 'poor'. The Ukip leader said he earned 'about half of what the local headmaster or GP earns'. But Mr Farage and his wife Kirsten enjoy a lifestyle far beyond the reach of ordinary voters. The couple live in a home worth around £540,000 and have annual earnings of more than £100,000, including: . When asked if he would ever be Prime Minister, he told them: 'I doubt it'. The Gogglebox pair pressed him if he wanted to be the PM. He replied: 'Not really. There are two types of people in politics: those who want to be something and those who want to do something. I want to do something. Changing things in the country and changing the debate really interests me.' The programme, At Home with Dom and Steph, is based in Mr and Mrs Parker's bed and breakfast in Kent. The posh B&B sits in the constituency of South Thanet where Mr Farage will be standing in his bid to become an MP in the 2015 General Election. Over the course of the interview, Mr Farage joins the couple in their local pub before ending up wearing his host's trousers after spilling champagne down his after a 'rip roaring' evening. On LBC Mr Farage insisted that he did not collapse because of booze. He said: 'They wanted to get me to pose sitting on a concrete step with them having a glass of champagne which I did. 'My body isn't particularly great at getting down and getting up again with all the back and neck problems I've got. So I got up and missed the top step with my...with a sort of toe. 'And the glass of champagne came out of my hand. And my very light grey trousers were covered in champagne. 'So you know I've no doubt that one or two newspapers before this is broadcast next will say that I collapsed. But nothing could be further from the truth.' He added: 'We had a couple of pints and a few glasses of wine. It wasn't even...it wasn't silly I promise you.' Steph and Dom Meet Nigel Farage is on Channel 4, Monday December 15, at 10pm . Nigel Farage's Hamburg-born wife Kirsten keeps a very low profile and is rarely seen in public . In his early 20s Nigel Farage had the first of several brushes with death, when he was run over by a car in Orpington, Kent, after a night in the pub. He sustained severe injuries and doctors feared he would lose a leg. Mr Farage was treated by a nurse called Grainne Hayes - who became his first wife. He had two sons with Ms Hayes, who are both now grown up. After splitting with Ms Hayes he married German-born bond trader Kirsten Mehr in 1999. Months after recovering from his road accident, Mr Farage was diagnosed with testicular cancer. It is one of the great contradictions of the Ukip leader that while he rails against Europeans ‘coming over here’ and taking the jobs, homes and public services of Brits that he is married to a German who could move here under the rules which he wants to tear up. He jokes that being married to a foreigner is proof that he loves Europe. Hamburg-born Kirsten keeps a very low profile and is rarely seen in public. At Ukip conferences, she sits anonymously in the audience. She and Mr Farage met in Frankfurt in 1996, while he was travelling on business - and still married to his first wife. Of the moment he met Kirsten, he once said: ‘She was a stunning government bond broker whose brisk efficiency at first sight belied her ethereal appearance. 'She could have stepped into a pre-Raphaelite painting no questions asked.’ Later, he explained in typically flamboyant style: ‘My marriage, which had been on ice and torpid with its claws bound for so long we had both forgotten it was alive at all, finally expired.’ The couple divorced in 1997 and Mr Farage married Kirsten in 1999. Kirsten, gave up her career in the City, where she worked as an interpreter for a German bank, to look after the children - she and Mr Farage have two - and take her husband’s correspondence. She writes all his emails because he dislikes using computers and is paid a salary by the European Parliament of more than £27,000 and has amassed more than £200,000 since she began working for him.","Farage makes admission in booze-fuelled interview with Gogglebox couple .

"A glass of wine or a relaxing bath can be the perfect remedy after a stressful day. And now you can combine the two without fear of spilling a drop thanks to a new invention. A pair of brothers from the U.S. have created the 'SipCaddy' - a portable cup holder that can hold wine glasses that can be attached to the side of a bath or shower. It has a suction pad that sticks to smooth surfaces and it can hold beer cans, bottles, cups, and many other household items. Unwind: A new invention allows people to relax in the bath while enjoying a glass of wine . SipCaddy was designed and developed by a small team of drinking enthusiasts, architects, and designers, led by two brothers, Carson and Keefe. The creators say that the $13.95 (£8.91) cup holder is ideal for enjoying a glass of wine or cold beer in the bath. The device is made of strong, durable, recyclable ABS plastic and is dishwasher safe. Versatile: The product can hold both wine glasses and cans and was developed by brothers in the U.S . The team say their product is different from other cup holders on the market because of its versatility. It can hold bottles, wine glasses, champagne flutes, slim coffee mugs, solo cups, regular cups, and a wide variety of bathroom products weighing up to 24oz. Carson, from Atlanta, who has a degree in economics from Georgia State University told MailOnline: 'I always joked around about drinking beer in the shower. When I researched it, there wasn't even a quality portable cup holder out there. 'I saw that a few companies had a wine holder, but that idea has been done many times in the last 10 years and they are all far from innovative: all of them being just a flat piece of plastic with a slit in it. 'I like baths too and it suddenly occurred to me that I could have a cup holder with a gap in the front that could hold stemware. This doesn't affect the functionality of the cup holder at all, it actually improves it because it allows it to expand.' He added: 'I noticed that while there were all kinds of portable beverage holders available, all of them could hold either stemware or cups and cans, but none were designed to hold both.' 'It seemed like a niche we could fill with a novel, cool clean design and offer it in fun translucent colours, specifically for the shower and bath, but useful wherever a suction cup will stick.' Carson joined forces with his brother, Keefe, who lives in Brooklyn and has a Masters in architecture from the New School in Manhattan and his own design/build firm, to make the product a reality. After months of research including several rounds of digitally modeling the design and 3D printing the prototypes, SipCaddy was launched over the summer. Sip in the shower: The brothers say their invention is different to other cup holders because it can hold 'stemware, cups and cans' Carson explained: 'My brother did around 10 drawings and prototyped them using a 3D printer. We finally came up with the perfect design. While it appears simple, a lot of thought was put into the design to hold the largest variety of beverages possible. You'll be surprised how most are a perfect fit. It can hold cans from 6oz all the way up to 25oz. It also holds almost anything else you can think of. He added: 'The designs were extensively prototyped using 3D printing, which allowed us to test and fine tune SipCaddy to hold the widest range of drinks possible, with the most efficient use of material and a clean look. 'Sipcaddy has really caught on quickly since its release in late August, and we're looking forward to releasing new colours in the new year. 'We have recently been able to make it possible to ship internationally at very reasonable rates through our website, and we are fulfilling orders worldwide.' Cocktail party while you wash: The cup holders have been tested to hold items weighing 6oz to 24oz . The cup holders cost $13.95 (£8.91) and come in different colours but the manufacturers warn you should test the suction before placing a glass in it . However, the company warn on their website that users may have to experiment with their cup holder and surface to find the best stick and they advise against using glass. They write: 'Even though we have the best suction cup, it still has to be applied properly and maintained like anything that involves a suction cup. We have found that giving it a little tiny lick or drop of moisture helps maintain the suction even better. 'In bathroom environments, condensation and moisture on the surfaces may eventually weaken the suction. It is recommended to reapply the suction cup before use, and always test the SipCaddy before putting in your drink. We do not recommend using glass, as accidents can sometimes happen. Do not apply after there is condensation, make sure the surface is dry first.' For more information visit www.sipcaddy.com .","A pair of brothers from the U.S. have created the 'SipCaddy'

"Tragedy has struck a family for a second time after a three-year-old girl died in a car crash while travelling home from a Christmas gathering near Esk in Queensland's south-east. Eleven years after losing the toddler's grandparents, Aurora Luder was driving along Gatton Esk Road in Buaraba on Saturday night with parents Amiee and Sam as well as brother, Zachary. Their car collided with another car travelling in the opposite direction near the intersection of Buaraba Creek Road. The three-year-old girl died at the scene while her parents and brother were airlifted to hospital with serious injuries, according to police. Eleven years after losing the toddler's grandparents, Aurora Luder was driving along Gatton Esk Road in Buaraba on Saturday night with parents Amiee and Sam as well as brother, Zachary . Sam, 25, suffered bruising, cuts and fractures to his face - including his cheek, bone and eye socket. While Amiee, 25, has a broken right arm and bruises, and Zachary, 4, has a broken collarbone. A relative - who did not want to be named - told Daily Mail Australia the family were having a tough time. 'You just need to understand how hard this is for us as now Aurora is with her nan and pop who were taken in a car accident 11 years ago,' she said. The three-year-old (left) died at the scene while her four-year-old brother, Zachary (right), suffered a broken collarbone . The family were travelling back to their home in Esk when they collided with another car near the intersection of Buaraba Creek Road . The family lived in Esk and the accident took place just south of the regional town in south-east Queensland . 'There was a meteor shower last night and that Aurora was shining through the shooting stars.' Aurora's death has also come barely two weeks before her brother's fifth birthday on Boxing Day. To help the family through this difficult time, a fundraising page has been started up by Aurora's aunt, Sheridan Luder, and family friend Rachelle Torrens. On the gofundme page, Aurora is described as 'a bright spark that lit up the room wherever she went'. Her vivacious nature was responsible for the fundraising campaign's namesake, which reflected Aurora being 'a bright star in life, but now a bright star in the sky, shining forever for her family'. 'Whether it was riding motorbikes with her dad and Zach, or holding her baby cousin Axel, beneath that tomboy exterior was a gentle, loving and caring little girl who would always look out for those she loved,' it said. Aurora has been described as a 'bright star' with a tomboy attitude and a heart of a gold . The toddler was also looking forward to starting kindergarten next year. 'She was actually more excited to start kindy than she was about Christmas,' the page said. 'That zest for life certainly rubbed off on anyone she would meet.' The money raised will be used to help the Luders and to give back to a family who have had a long history of generosity. 'There will be many ways to help in the long run, and we know times are going to be hard for them,' the website said. 'But if everyone joins together and donates something, whether $1 or $1 million, any donation will be appreciated. So please donate and help make this family smile again. 'Please accept our heartfelt thanks for all of your contributions.'","Aurora Luder died on Saturday night near Esk in Queensland's south-east .

Sunrise: Sunlight flooded a canal in Cambridgeshire this morning after a night of milder temperatures across much of England and Wales . Morning: After a spell of spring-like weather this week, with above average temperatures of between 11C and 12C in the day and mild night-time temperatures of 8C to 9C, forecasters expect it to become progressively colder. Pictured: London at dawn (left) and a River Cam sunrise . After a spell of spring-like weather this week, with above average temperatures of between 11C and 12C in the day and mild night-time temperatures of 8C to 9C, forecasters expect it to become progressively colder towards the end of the week. Cold air from polar areas, such as Iceland and Greenland, will bring a noticeable drop in temperatures on Friday, with the cold snap set to last into next week. Mark Wilson, a forecaster at the Met Office, said today would be mainly dry with sunny spells across much of Britain, with the exception of Scotland which will continue to see heavy, wintry showers and snow on higher ground. After a cold night tonight, with temperatures dropping to freezing in towns and cities and -3C in rural areas, the mercury will begin to rise into the middle of the week. By Wednesday, warmer winds from the Atlantic will sweep westerly across the country, bringer milder conditions and positively balmy temperatures of 12C. The above-average temperatures will be felt across much of England and Wales, although northern Scotland will stay cold with wintry showers. Despite the milder conditions, rain will sweep across the country on Wednesday and winds will gradually become stronger. By the end of the week, the milder air and warmer conditions will be replaced by cold north-westerly winds, which will see temperatures plummet once again to freezing. Mr Wilson said the colder airflow would see daytime temperatures of about 6C on Friday and into the weekend, and night-time temperatures of freezing or just below. He said Scotland would continue to see cold, wintry showers, with snow continuing to fall on higher ground and, at times, on lower levels. Dawn: Forecasters predict a mild spell before the cold snap returns Friday. Pictured: Thick cloud gathered over London at sunrise this morning . Moody: The Met Office said temperatures would drop to freezing tonight but said the mercury would rise to 12C across much of the country on Wednesday, although Scotland is set to remain cold with wintry showers and possible snow on higher ground. Pictured: Sunrise in London . City: Bookies have now slashed the odds for a white Christmas, with punters convinced that the cold north-westerly winds sweeping across the country over the weekend will bring snow. Towns and cities, including London (pictured) will feel milder before the cold snap returns . Idyllic: A spectacular red sky sunrise  over the causeway and its historic buildings in Godmanchester, Cambridgeshire, yesterday . Met Office forecaster Kirk Waite added: ‘From Monday morning it is going to be milder, although there is the risk of some rain and wintry showers to the North where it will be colder. ‘The first real push of milder conditions is expected into Wednesday. This is due to a westerly pattern, though behind that it is again looking cooler.’ Although the Met Office has not yet issued its forecast for the Christmas period, bookmakers are becoming increasingly convinced that snow will fall on Christmas Day. One company, Coral, has cut the odds on a white Christmas to 4/7 anywhere in Britain, with Aberdeen the favourite at 3/1. A final forecast by the Met Office is usually made about five days before Christmas, but spokesman Nicola McGeady said: ‘The Christmas spirit is alive in punters, who are queuing up to bet on a white Christmas in their local city. As December 25 nears, the odds on it actually happening continue to fall.’ While snow could still be on the cards for the festive period in Britain, thousands of families due to leave the UK for an Alpine skiing break next weekend are facing the prospect of a green Christmas. Many resorts across the Alps and Pyrenees had already pushed back their opening weekends from December 6 to December 13 after warm temperatures caused early snowfall in November to melt across resorts in France, Austria and Italy. But yesterday skiers at the French resort of Les Arcs, which makes up half of the giant Paradiski skiing domain, found green meadows or slopes dusted with just a light covering where inches of snow would usually have fallen by now. The resort’s daily ski report said the nearest fresh snow was 77 miles away. Winter: While milder temperatures are forecast for much of the country, the Northumberland borders and Scotland remain under heavy snow .

"For the first time since the 9/11 attack, the federal government has recognized that people who lived near Ground Zero and first responders got cancer from toxic dust from the scene. The National Institute for Occupational . Safety and Health announced the findings ahead of the 11th anniversary of the terrorist attack tomorrow. The institute is responsible for deciding whether cancer . should be among the illnesses covered by the James Zadroga 9/11 Health . and Compensation Act. Around 50 cancers are included. The ruling means thousands of people who are sure they got sick in the aftermath of the outrage will be eligible for compensation. Tragedy: An estimated 3,000 people were killed when the terrorists hijacked passenger jets and flew them into the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon in Arlington on 9/11 . Deadly fumes: The Zadroga Act did not cover cancer because there was not enough evidence linking it to the toxins emitted at Ground Zero after the terrorist attack . Legacy: James Zadroga, with his daughter, inspired a law to compensate 9/11 rescue workers exposed to toxins at the site . Michael Barasch, a lawyer who represent thousands of first responders and residents, told the New York Post: 'There’s new scientific evidence that dust is what is now linked to not only the respiratory illnesses, but all these cancers.' John Walcott, an NYPD detective who was . diagnosed with leukemia in 2003 after working months at Ground Zero and . the Fresh Kills landfill said: 'It’s a bittersweet thing. It took 11 years to do what should have been done a long time ago.' The Zadroga Act - named after NYPD Detective James Zadroga, who died age 34 after working on the World Trade Center pile - was passed into law two years ago. Under the Act $2.8 billion was set aside to compensate people made ill by exposure to toxins at the site. Another $1.5 billion has been allocated over five years to fund the World Trade Center Health Program, which treats and monitors about 40,000 first responders. Analysis showed that the substances in the dust from the collapse of the World Trade Center's twin towers included cement, gypsum, asbestos, glass fibers, calcium carbonate, lead and other metal particles and toxins. It is believed that exposure to this dust through the lungs and skin has contributed to the asthma, gastrointestinal problems, and possibly the increased cancer risk experienced by rescue workers, especially those who were on the site immediately after the attack, when the cloud of debris dust was its thickest. The pH of the dust was very high, meaning it was highly alkaline and extremely caustic. Asbestos causes lung and other types of cancer, while lead and other heavy metals can be toxic to the brain. Dr Philip Landrigan, dean for global health at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, said:  'A lot of the respiratory diseases and the gastroesophageal reflux disease we're seeing in the 9/11 responders is the direct consequence of inhaling this toxic dust. '""It lands in the sinuses and bronchial tubes, causing irritation, redness and swelling.' Source: ABC . It originally did not cover cancer because there was not enough evidence linking it to the toxins emitted at Ground Zero. 'To me, it's common sense. If you . breathe in toxic fumes, you're going to get cancer,' said U.S. Rep . Carolyn Maloney, a Manhattan Democrat who helped author the bill. But even Maloney conceded that it is . difficult to find hard data proving the connection between cancer and . the dust at ground zero. That's why in crafting the Zadroga Act, . lawmakers were careful to include mechanisms that would allow for . illnesses to be added based on new scientific research. This was despite thousands of responders claiming top be sick because of their part in the rescue efforts. About 400 first responders or people who lived near the site have died from cancer since 9/11, according to the most recent estimates. With the inclusion of cancer in the program, there will be more victims seeking compensation yet no increase in the $2.77billion fund - meaning individual rewards will be lower. Thomas Gilmartin, a smoker who suffers from lung disease and sleep apnea, told the Post: 'They’re going to add cancers, but are . they going to add more money to the fund? 'It’s crazy. Every . time, we gotta fight. It’s two years since Obama signed that bill and . nobody’s got ten cents.' The Victim Compensation Fund’s special master, Sheila Birnbaum, has been responsible for evenhandedly . distributing $2.7 billion to ground zero responders and others who . became ill after being exposed to dust and ash from the smoldering ruins . of the World Trade Center. Attorney: Sheila Birnbaum has been responsible for evenhandedly distributing $2.7 billion to Ground Zero responders and others who became ill after being exposed to dust and ash from the smoldering ruins of the World Trade Center . Toxic: Many of the first responders and those who labored at the site in the months following the attacks suffer from a variety of respiratory ailments after working at the World Trade Center site . Choking: People, seen masking their mouths from the pitch-dark dust, run World Trade Center's collapse . She will be permitted to spend only $875 million of the fund’s total in the first five years after the initial payments begin. Jeff Stroehlein, a 17-year firefighter who worked on Ground Zero, was diagnosed with brain cancer in March 2011 . After those five years pass, people with valid claims will begin to receive their remaining portion of the additional $1.9 billion. In the two years since the law was passed, about 40,000 responders and survivors receive monitoring and 20,000 get treatment for illnesses as part of the World Trade Center Health Program. With time still left to submit claims, some people are holding out in the event that they become sick in the near future. Others are waiting until the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health officially adds 14 broad categories of cancer to the list of conditions covered by the fund. Recently diagnosed with leukemia and lymphoma, 55-year-old Brian Casse hopes he can secure money from the fund to support his wife and children in case he takes a turn for the worst. Casse, a retired firefighter who helped clear away the mountain of rubble at ground zero, believes there's little doubt his work at the site is responsible for his illness. 'You've got people in this city who went down there and did what we had to do. And a lot of us got sick because of it,' Casse said. 'To make us now fight for this money, it's not right. In the grand scheme of things, this money's a drop in the bucket.' Victim: Mr Stroehlein was one of 40,000 construction workers, firefighters and police officers who labored on what became known as the Pile, the mountain of debris that had been the twin towers of the World Trade Center . Jeff Stroehlin was one of 40,000 construction workers, firefighters and police officers who worked tirelessly on what became known as the Pile, the mountain of debris that had been the twin towers of the World Trade Center. In March 2011, Mr Stroehlein was diagnosed with a rare lymphoma, a cloud-like mass on the front of his brain. The tumor was unusual in being a primary, the disease commonly spreading to the brain from another part of the body . He underwent months of chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant last August. His last four MRIs have showed no sign of the cancer, he told Long Island Newsday, but he fears it is only a matter of time until it comes back. 'This isn't just for me,' he said of the coverage. 'This is for everybody else. First of all, I'm lucky enough to be talking to you. But what about the guy who could lose his house trying to pay his medical bills?'","The National Institute for Occupational .

This summer the Kremlin announced it will spend about $600billion on its state armaments programme by 2020 to upgrade and modernise its military capabilities. The rise in sales comes after an even bigger increase registered the year before, 2012, when SIPRI said Russian arms makers' revenues were up 35 per cent. The military modernisation programme comes despite an economic crisis in Russia worsened by Western sanctions and plummetting oil and gas prices. Russia's has the world's third highest defence budget, having doubled its military expenditure since 2004. Spending on the military is set to rise by 85 per cent between 2012 and 2017, CNN Money reported. The Kremlin's spending is still dwarfed by the world's biggest players, however. China spent twice as much as Russia on its military last year, while the U.S. spent more than seven times as much. Growth industry: Sales by Russian arms makers were up 20 per cent between 2012 and 2013, even as sales by other countries' arms industries slid, according to Stockholm International Peace Research Institute data . Massive arms industry: This graphic by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute shows how Russia is now the third-biggest arms manufacturer by sales, after the UK and the U.S. CNN Money reports that the Kremlin has 'airfields, hundreds of fighter jets and a new fleet of battle tanks ... in the works', as well as eight new ships ready by 2020 and a new advanced nuclear submarine already delivered. The figures come from SIPRI's index of the 100 leading arms companies, published today. The 100 companies had global sales of a mammoth $402billion last year, which despite three years of declines remains 45.5 per cent higher than the total figure for 2002. SIPRI's index excludes Chinese arms companies due to a lack of data. Russia and the West are more at odds than at any time since the end of the Cold War. Russia accuses Europe and the U.S. over engineering a right-wing coup in Ukraine, while Nato says Moscow is providing material support to partisans opposing Kiev's new regime. Meanwhile, Nato allies have accused Russia of stepping up military activity around Europe. British Foreign Secretary Micheal Fallon yesterday accused Vladimir Putin of playing a ‘provocative and dangerous’ game by ordering Russian Bear bombers to fly near British waters. Mr Fallon said Mr Putin’s new aggression could even spark a war with Nato forces. In a blunt message, he said Britain should ‘prepare for the worst’ as the Russian President flexes his muscles. Closely watched: RAF Typhoon jets were scrambled in October to track this Russian Tu-95 Bear H bomber, one of two which flew close to Britain without filing flight plans or communicating with air traffic controllers. Followed: These RAF images show the moment the aircraft were escorted by Typhoons near British airspace . SIPRI says the crisis in Ukraine could help boost Russian arms sales. Aude Fleurant, research director at the institute, told CNN Money reporter Ivana Kottasova: 'It is too early to say, but the conflict is likely to have an impact on some specific orders - especially conventional ammunition.' Siemon Wezeman, Senior Researcher with the SIPRI Arms and Military Expenditure Programme, said: 'The remarkable increases in Russian companies’ arms sales in both 2012 and 2013 are in large part due to uninterrupted investments in military procurement by the Russian Government during the 2000s. 'These investments are explicitly intended to modernise national production capabilities and weapons in order to bring them on par with major U.S. and Western European arms producers’ capabilities and technologies.'","Russia now the world's third biggest arms dealer after the U.S. and the UK .

"Developers are exploiting planning reforms to inflict ‘inappropriate and unwanted’ housing on communities, a damning report has found. The first official analysis of the Government’s shake-up two years ago warns that desirable areas have become a ‘battleground’ between councils and landowners. In a report published today, MPs say the new rules are allowing housing to be ‘imposed on some communities’ by developers using legal loopholes to override local opposition. Presumption in favour of development... The first official analysis of the Government’s shake-up two years ago warns that desirable areas have become a ‘battleground’ between councils and landowners. File picture . The National Planning Policy Framework, introduced in March 2012, encouraged councils to earmark suitable land to meet demand for housing over the next five years. Most contentiously, councils were also ordered to have a ‘presumption’ in favour of development, to meet the demand for housing from a growing population. But the Commons Communities and Local Government Committee warns that developers are exploiting this provision to secure prime greenfield land. When council planners try to veto an application, developers are able to use the guidelines as a ‘stick with which to beat them’, the report says. It concluded: ‘Our report has identified a number of issues with the operation of the NPPF: that it is not preventing unsustainable development; that it is leading to communities being subject to inappropriate and unwanted housing development; and that it is giving insufficient protection to England’s town centres.’ Campaigners have raised concerns about the new planning rules since they were brought in, saying they have led to a free-for-all for developers. Former Tory minister Nick Herbert, the MP for Arundel and the South Downs, last year denounced the NFFP as an ‘environmental disaster’. And earlier this year campaigners claimed that planning permission had been given on appeal for a staggering 27,000 houses on greenfield sites turned down by councils, in the last two years. In today’s report ‘Operation of the NPPF’, the committee which reviewed 300 pieces of written evidence and interviewed 40 witnesses, agreed there were serious concerns about the reforms. Parish councils said they felt ‘under siege’ and that permission was being given for homes with no thought to the impact on ‘local infrastructure such as schools, health care, transport and sewerage’. Ministers were urged to close a loophole which allows developers to build on land which the council has not included in its ‘local plan’ – the area the local authority has designated for new homes. Brickie: Earlier this year campaigners claimed that planning permission had been given on appeal for a staggering 27,000 houses on greenfield sites turned down by councils, in the last two years. File picture . The MPs heard that developers would reject the sites they had been offered, and then issue new planning applications to try to secure more desirable plots on the edges of towns and villages. Committee chair Clive Betts, a Labour MP, said: ‘We heard developers were claiming sites were unviable in order to obtain planning permission on other, more lucrative sites against the wishes of the council and communities.’ The reasons they gave for the land being unviable could be ‘unreliable’ or in some cases the developers refused to reveal them due to ‘commercial confidentiality’, MPs were told. The report said: ‘We are concerned that the question of viability of becoming a battleground between developers and local authorities. ‘There is a perception amongst councils that developers are using the NPPF provisions as a stick with which to beat them…and getting more greenfield sites added to the land supply’. MPs said they had decided against ordering ministers to ‘tear up’ the planning guidance and start again but fundamental changes were needed to ‘ensure it does the job it was intended to do’. Mr Betts suggested that when land for new housing is chosen ‘the same weight needs to be given to environmental and social factors as to the economic dimension’. They also called for the government to scrap the rules which make it easier to turn former shops into homes as they are ‘making the town centre an unattractive place to visit or indeed to live’.","New rules allowing developers to overrule local government decisions .

"Economical: Wood-fired sources of heating have become increasingly popular to cut heating costs, with 200,000 stoves installed a year . They are in hot demand among Britons hoping to save money on energy bills. But trendy wood-burning stoves are fuelling air pollution, scientists warn. Research shows levels of a particularly nasty form of pollution surge during winter when stoves and open fires are lit. Wood-fired sources of heating have become increasingly popular to cut heating costs, with 200,000 stoves installed a year. Estate agents say they can add up to 5 per cent to a house’s value. They are also seen as environmentally friendly because carbon dioxide released by burning wood is taken up by young trees – making the fuel carbon neutral. As a result, homeowners can get government subsidies if they install wood-fired boilers. But wood may not be as green as it seems. Scientists from King’s College London say burning wood generates particulates – minuscule particles that can raise the risk of heart disease, trigger asthma and shorten lives. Their research shows levels surge during winter evenings – when wood-burning accounts for 13 per cent of particulates in the air in some British cities. In some hot spots, the pollution is comparable to that from traffic fumes. Researcher Dr Gary Fuller told the Sunday Times: ‘Although the apparent carbon neutrality of wood may make it appear environmentally friendly, there is growing evidence of adverse health effects from wood smoke. ‘Domestic wood burning takes place where people live and at times when they are at home. ‘Coupled with still night-time conditions even modest wood-burning in urban areas may lead to particulate exposures comparable to those from traffic sources. ‘We need to manage urban emissions to ensure increased wood-burning does not offset schemes to reduce traffic pollution.’ Lethal: Scientists from King’s College London say burning wood generates particulates – minuscule particles that can raise the risk of heart disease, trigger asthma and shorten lives . The Stove Industry Alliance, which represents manufacturers, said that modern stoves are greener than their predecessors. Hugh Wells, the association’s deputy chairman, said: ‘Wood-fired stoves are a genuinely green and carbon neutral way of heating your home, which can save you money and make you less dependent on the big energy companies. ‘Modern stoves are very efficient and clean, with about 14 milligrams of particulate per cubic metre of air. ‘The compares to 100mg five years ago.’ The Department of Energy and Climate Change said that the technology has ‘an important role to play in transforming the way we heat our homes.’","Burning wood generates particulates that can raise risk of asthma .

"Cornered: Taxi driver Kenneth Wolfe, 78, was left with a fractured eye socket and broken nose after he was attacked by the men in Southend, Essex . This distressing photo shows the face of a 78-year-old taxi driver after he was cornered beaten to a pulp by three men when he challenged them over an unpaid fare. Kenneth Wolfe suffered a fractured eye socket and broken nose when he was attacked by Adam Rhuebell, Axl Gilbert, and Charlie Laidlaw outside a Sainsbury's in Southend, Essex. CCTV footage of the incident shows the three men turning on Mr Wolfe after he got out of his taxi and demanded they pay their £11 fare. The attackers were sentenced to a total of more than 24 years in prison last week. The court heard that a pre-sentence report had determined that Gilbert, of Rochford, Essex, was at risk of killing someone if he did not complete an intervention programme in prison. Mr Wolfe stopped outside the supermarket after his passengers, Gilbert, 21, and Laidlaw, 22, said that they needed to use the cash machine. The court heard that Gilbert, of Rochford, Essex, was determined by a pre-sentence report to be at risk of killing someone. The pair met Rhuebell, 24, who was homeless, on the street, and tried to run away without paying their fare. CCTV footage played to Basildon Crown Court showed Mr Wolfe get out of his car and demand they pay the fare. The thugs then cornered him and subjected him to a brutal beating. Mr Wolfe suffered a fractured cheek, a fractured eye socket, a broken nose and a number of missing teeth. He still suffers flashbacks and has been unable to return to his job as a taxi driver since the attack in February. Gilbert, of Rochford, Essex, was sentenced to 10 years and 10 months in jail with an extended licence period of three years because he was deemed such a danger to the public. Tom Quinn, mitigating, read out character references from more than 30 members of Laidlaw's friends and family who expressed their shock at the attack and described him as a usually kind man. He was jailed for six years and nine months. The court heard that Rhuebell had grown up in care and had 45 convictions for 92 offences.

Sentencing the three, Judge Jonathan Black, said: 'Taxi drivers carry out a valuable function at night, often in the face of unwarranted abuse from clients worse for wear through drink and drugs. 'They are vulnerable to attacks such as the one carried out by you. 'Mr Wolfe was carrying out a public service on the night he was attacked, which made him particularly vulnerable and that will be treated as an aggravating factor.'","Kenneth Wolfe was cornered and attacked by men in Southend, Essex .

"British business guru Sir Lindsay Owen-Jones enjoyed the sweet smell of success as CEO of French cosmetic giant L'Oreal, but now feels the need to kick up a stink – over a chip stall that he says is ruining his Alpine ski holidays. Sir Lindsay, a Welsh-born Oxford University graduate who stepped down as head of L'Oreal in 2006, wants a chip stall that operates outside his luxury chalet in the French resort of Val d'Isere shut down, claiming that it's an 'olfactory nuisance' and represents 'an abnormal disturbance'. The stall is owned by Valerie Maertens, and her lawyer, Maitre Francois Bern, argued that his client's livelihood is more important than the retired businessman's 'precious nostrils'. British business guru Sir Lindsay Owen-Jones, pictured with his wife Cristina, wants a chip stall that operates outside his luxury chalet in Val d'Isere shut down, claiming that it's an 'olfactory nuisance' The stall is owned by Valerie Maertens (pictured), and her lawyer, Maitre Francois Bern, argued that his client's livelihood is more important than Sir Lindsay's 'precious nostrils' Fuming:  Ms Maertens has said she feels 'angry and persecuted' The case will be heard at Albertville court tomorrow - and is the fifth attempt by Sir Lindsay to have the stall closed. His lawsuit argues that the stall, which is extremely popular with skiers who buy chips there throughout the day, produces 'a very important olfactory nuisance due to the cooking and frying odours that rise up into their flats and on to their balconies', according to The Times. What's more, it adds, the stall spoils the 'view and exceptional tranquillity' of the apartment, as there are 'numerous chairs… multi-coloured parasols, dustbins and vehicles' in front of it, the paper said. However, Mr Bern retorted that multi-millionaire Sir Lindsay, whose former company makes world-famous scents, is engaging in 'judicial harassment' to protect nostrils accustomed only to inhaling fine aromas. Prestigious: Val d'Isere, in the French Alps, attracts a well-heeled crowd . He added: 'This is a lawsuit brought by rich people who live in silk and comfort, who only inhale perfume and who want to stop this lady from living.' When the matter went to court in 2012, Ms Maertens said: 'I'm angry and I feel persecuted. For rich people, it's certain that a chip stall in front of them is going to be annoying but us, we have to work for a living. 'They complain about the noise and the smell of chips, but if you want peace and quiet, you don't buy an apartment at the foot of the slopes.' When Sir Lindsay took over L'Oreal's in the mid-1980s, annual sales were 3.7 billion dollars, and when he stood down they were 14.5 billion dollars. Much of the success was based on brilliant marketing, including slogans like 'Because You're Worth it'. As well as skiing, Sir Lindsay, who is now 68, is passionate about numerous sports including motor racing and sailing. He was knighted in 2005.","Sir Lindsay Owen-Jones wants a chip stall in Val d'Isere closed down .

"A Manhattan sports memorabilia shop is selling a rare Babe Ruth rookie card for $695,000. The 1914 card, which is believed to be one of only 10 still to exist, shows the baseball legend as a pitcher for a Baltimore pro team before he went on to the majors later that year.

'You can't go out there and ring a bell and get one of these things. These are for the people who have everything and can't find anything else,' he told the New York Post. The Gotta Have It website states: 'This is a 1914 Baltimore News Babe Ruth rookie card that pictures Ruth as an unknown minor-league rookie right out of St. Mary’s Industrial School for Boys. 'Part of an obscure set of cards issued in Baltimore depicting stars of the city’s two professional baseball teams, the Terrapins of the Federal League and the Orioles of the International League of which Ruth is identified as a pitcher; the card posts the 1914 schedule of the Baltimore International League on the verso.' Mr Ruth became the first baseball player ever to hit 60 runs in one season (1927) and claimed 2,873 hits throughout his career . It is not clear how the shop came to acquire the red and white card. In July, a contract signed by Ruth with the Boston Red Sox in 1918 sold for $1.02 million at auction. At the same auction his bat sold for $214,000, but the first baseball whacked over the Yankee Stadium fence by the legendary slugger failed to land a new home. Ruth's bat was discovered in a stash of pre-World War I Red Sox bats found in a 150-year-old home outside Boston. The bat sold  was used from 1916 to 1918, a period in which the left-handed pitcher helped the Red Sox win its last World Series for 86 years, a dry spell that ended in 2004. The initial item up for bid was the first ball ever hit out of the park by Ruth, who was trying out the Yankee Stadium field for a newspaper editor. It had been expected to go for $1 million or more, but was withdrawn from the sale after it failed to attract even the minimum bid of $100,000. In February Ruth's pocket watch from the 1923 World Series sold for $717,000 at auction in New York City. The pentagonal 14-karat gold watch was bought by a telephone bidder who is remaining anonymous, Heritage Auctions said. The watch is engraved with a picture of a pitcher, hitter and catcher and a ball in flight. It is inscribed, ""Presented by Baseball Commissioner to George H. Ruth.""

Ruth entered Major League Baseball as a pitcher and outfielder for the Boston Red Sox in 1914. He was traded to the New York Yankees in 1919, where he became the 'Sultan of Swat.' Setting the league record for home runs (714), slugging percentage (690) and runs batted (2,217), he was a beloved and brilliant player with humble beginnings. Ruth was born on February 6, 1895, to German-American parents in Pigtown, a rough neighborhood of Baltimore, Maryland. When he was just seven years old, his father sent him to St Mary's Industrial School for Boys. a reformatory and orphanage, and gave up custody of Mr Ruth. He was scouted while playing ball as a teenager and was quickly shuffled off to the Boston Red Sox and then the Yankees. Ruth became the first baseball player ever to hit 60 runs in one season (1927) and claimed 2,873 hits throughout his career. Ruth passed away at the age of 53 on August 16, 1948. 100,000 fans mourned his body when it was laid out at Yankee Stadium's entrance.","The card is believed to be one of only ten still to exist .

"The families of nine of the 26 people killed and a teacher wounded two years ago at the Sandy Hook Elementary School filed a wrongful lawsuit Monday against the manufacturer, distributor and seller of the rifle used in the shooting. The negligence and wrongful death lawsuit, filed in Bridgeport Superior Court, asserts that the Bushmaster AR-15 rifle should not have been made publicly available because it was designed for military use and is unsuited for hunting or home defense. 'The AR-15 was specifically engineered for the United States military to meet the needs of changing warfare,' attorney Josh Koskoff, of law firm Koskoff, Koffkoff & Bieder, said in a press release.

In addition to Bushmaster, the defendants are Camfour, a firearm distributor, and Riverview Gun Sales, the Connecticut store where gunman Adam Lanza's mother Nancy purchased the Bushmaster rifle in 2010. Gunman: Adam Lanza (pictured) shot 26 people on December 14, 2012, including his mother and 20 school children . Messages seeking comment from the defendants were not immediately returned. Bill Sherlach, whose wife, Mary, was killed in the shooting, said he believes in the Second Amendment but also that the gun industry needs to be held to 'standard business practices' when it comes to assuming the risk for producing, making and selling a product. 'These companies assume no responsibility for marketing and selling a product to the general population who are not trained to use it nor even understand the power of it,' he said. The plaintiffs include Sherlach and the families of Vicki Soto, Dylan Hockley, Noah Pozner, Lauren Rousseau, Benjamin Wheeler, Jesse Lewis, Daniel Barden, Rachel D'Avino and teacher Natalie Hammond, who was injured in the shooting. The lawsuit seeks unspecified monetary damages. Nicole Hockley, Dylan's mother, planned a news conference later Monday morning with U.S. Rep. Elizabeth Esty and U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy. The Newtown gunman, Adam Lanza, shot and killed his mother Nancy on the morning of December 14, 2012, before driving to the school and shooting through the entrance. Principal  Dawn Hochspring and school psychologist Mary Scherlach confronted Lanza at the front of the school, but he shot them dead and fired several shots at teacher Natalie Hammond, who survived after crawling into a meeting room. Survivor: Sandy Hook teacher Natalie Hammond (right) is joining the families of nine victims in the lawsuit against Bushmaster. She was shot several times by gunman Adam Lanza, but survived the attack after crawling to safety in a meeting room. Pictured above receive a certificate of commendation on May 6, 2013 . Chaos: The scene near Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14, 2012 - the day Lanza went on his deadly rampage . Aurora, Colorado: Shooter James Holmes killed 12 people and wounded 58 when he opened fire on a film screening of The Dark Knight. He was armed with an AR-15 rifle, a 12-gauge shotgun and at least one of two .40-caliber handguns. Portland, Oregon: James Tyler Roberts stole a AR-15 to shoot dead two people in the food court of the Clackamas Town Center Mall in December 2012. Santa Monica, California: Gunman John Zawahri assembled an AR-15-style gun to go on a rampage at his father's home and Santa Monica College in June 2013, killing five people. Crandon, Wisconsin: Tyler Peterson shot dead seven people, including himself, using an AR-15 at a post-homecoming party in October 2007 . Lanza then went into two classrooms where she shot 20 children and four more school personnel, including two teachers, before committing suicide as police arrived. In the lawsuit, lawyers for the victims say the gun is to blame for the sheer amount of casualties. 'The number of lives lost in those 263 seconds was made possible by the shooter's weapon of choice,' the lawsuit reads. The lawsuit goes on to say that while the AR-15 is an efficient weapon on the battlefield, 'engineered to deliver maximum carnage', it has 'little utility for legitimate civilian purposes' and is especially dangerous is the hands of the mentally unstable, like Lanza. 'There is one tragically predictable civilian activity in which the AR-15 reigns supreme: mass shootings,' the suit says. 'Time and again, mentally unstable individuals and criminals have acquired an AR-15 with ease, and they have unleashed the rifle's lethal power into our streets, our malls, our places of worship, and our schools.' 'The risk of a mentally unstable individual gaining access to an assault rifle and unleashing its military firepower on innocent civilians is not theoretical for Bushmaster. It's a fact,' the law firm's  Katie Mesner-Hage added in the press release. The suit also points out that the AR-15 is only slightly different from the M-16, a weapon banned outside the military. Deadly: In the lawsuit, the families claim that the AR-15 (above) used by Lanza is only slightly different from the M-16 (below), a weapon banned from civilian use . Spot the difference? The lawsuit claims that an AR-15 is not suited for civilian use either for home security or hunting. Above, the AR-15's military counterpart, the M-16, which civilians are banned from using . Instead of downplaying the military quality of the weapon, the lawsuit says the gun's manufacturer markets the AR-15 as a combat-style gun, citing advertising campaigns and catalogs. One advertising campaign called the AR-15 'the uncompromising choice when you demand a rifle as mission adaptable as you are' while a catalogue said the weapon had 'military-proven performance'. 'Forces of opposition, bow down. You are single-handedly outnumbered,' another line of chilling advertising copy read. In 2005, Congress and President George W. Bush approved a federal law that shielded gun makers from lawsuits over criminal use of their products, with some exemptions. In a lawsuit over the .223-caliber Bushmaster rifle used in the Washington, D.C.-area sniper shootings that killed 10 people in 2002, Bushmaster and a gun dealer agreed to pay $2.5million to two survivors and six families in a 2004 settlement. It was the first time a gun manufacturer had agreed to pay damages to settle claims of negligent distribution of weapons, according to the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence. In that settlement, Bushmaster paid $550,000 and the Washington state gun dealer, where the sniper's rifle came from, paid $2million. In 2002, a federal judge in California ruled that Bushmaster and other gun manufacturers were not responsible for a 1999 shooting spree that killed a postal worker and injured five people at a Jewish community center in Los Angeles. The judge said a lawsuit by the victims' families did not show a link between the manufacturers and the shooting rampage. Dark day: Sunday marked the two-year anniversary of the massacre, and again the town of Newtown, Connecticut refused to hold memorial services for the horrific incident. However, they did acknowledge the day by hanging the flag on Main Street at half-staff . The act's exception is for negligent entrustment lawsuits in which a party can be held accountable for selling a weapon to another party who uses said weapon to cause harm to a third party. In order to win their case, the Sandy Hook families must prove that Bushmaster committed negligent entrustment by putting the AR-15 on the market. Dennis Heningan, the former director of the Legal Action Project at the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, explained the legal argument to the Wall Street Journal. 'The issue in this case will be whether courts are willing to construe the doctrine of negligent entrustment so broadly as to encompass a theory of liability that is based on the sale of a particular gun to the general public instead of to a potentially particular dangerous individual,' Mr Heningan told the Journal. Gun lobbyists have contentiously debated the idea that manufacturers are to blame for the shootings, saying it's not weapons who kill people - it's the people who shoot them. 'It’s very easy to blame an inanimate object. Any kind of instrument in the wrong hands can be put to evil use. This comes down to intent - criminal behavior, accountability and responsibility,' George Kollitides, chief executives of the Remington Outdoor Company said in a June 2013 interview with the Washington Times. Remington has owned the Bushmaster gun brand since a merger in 2011. For the victims' families, suing Bushmaster is a way of attempting to bring about change in the gun industry, an issue Congress has failed to address. 'If nothing is going to change federally, we might as well try' in court, Carlos Soto, brother of killed Sandy Hook teacher Vicki Soto, told the Wall Street Journal.","Families of nine of the 26 people killed and a teacher wounded in the tragedy two years ago suing gun producer Bushmaster .

"Dementia sufferer Sandy Simpson, 72, was able to walk out of his care home in Aberdeenshire and was spotted when he walked past his wife Morag . A man with dementia wandered out of his care home and was only spotted outside on his own when he walked past his wife. Sandy Simpson, 72, has been living at Pitcairn Lodge in Aberdeenshire for the last 15 months after being was diagnosed with dementia. But wife has decided to remove him from the home after a number of blunders by staff including the pensioner being left to sleep in his clothes and on a bare mattress, as well as being allowed to walk out alone. She said that staff at the care home, run by by the Birmingham-based Embrace Group, did not seem to understand her husband's condition. She said she feels the pensioner has 'no quality of life' at the home. Morag Simpson, 64, said: 'I was out for a meal with the Rotary club when I just happened to see him marching past the window. 'He has pretty bad dementia so he must have slipped out through an unattended door. 'It's a farce that this could happen when you think that we pay £3,000 a month to keep him there and the Government pay an extra £1,000 on top of that. 'I'm just glad I happened to be there. Anything could have happened to him otherwise.' Mrs Simpson, who separated from her husband in 2012 but then became his main carer, said there was a lack of understanding at the home towards Mr Simpson, a father of two. She added: 'The other night, I went in at 9pm to see what happened at bedtime. 'When I asked where his pyjamas were, the nurse told me he didn't have any, but I sent him in with several sets. 'By this time, the steam was coming out my ears. The staff had told me he would get up and go through to them in the middle of the night, so I asked if he was doing this naked. 'It was then that she told me he slept in his clothes. How is that acceptable?' Mrs Simpson said when she helped her husband change she noticed he had no underwear on.  She also found him with a bare mattress and no pillow cases. The choirmaster said she believes one of the biggest problems is the high turnover of staff which denies her husband the continuity he needs to help manage his condition. Morag Simpson, 64, claims the high turnover of staff at Pitcairn has not helped her husband's condition . Mr Simpson was able to walk out of the £4,000 a month care home undetected by staff caring for him . The pensioner was found by his wife on a bare mattress, as shown in a picture supplied by the 82-year-old's family. His wife discovered his pyjamas and were left in a drawer and he was left to sleep in his clothes . 'Sandy has no quality of life there.' added Mrs Simpson. She is due to remove him from the home at Kirkton of Skene, near Westhill, on December 20. Instead she said she will take him home to live with her and employ carers to help her look after the pensioner. Mrs Simpson has become her husband's carer and said she is removing from the home to live back with her . A spokesman for Pitcairn Lodge said it was investigating the issues raised and the claim that no one apologised after Mr Simpson was left to wander out alone. He said: 'The health and wellbeing of the people we support is our number one priority and we are taking these concerns very seriously. 'Whilst it would be inappropriate to comment on the care needs of an individual, we are committed to ensuring all residents receive the high standards of care they expect and deserve.'","Sandy Simpson was spotted walking past Rotary Club window by his wife .

"The Islamist fanatic who held at least a dozen people hostage in Sydney planned to send hundreds of abusive letters to the families of British soldiers who died in Afghanistan, it has emerged. Man Haron Monis said he wanted to send a 'very nice condolence letter' and '237 baskets of flowers' to British families who lost loved ones in the war since 2001. But he was blocked from carrying out his plan by a Sydney court in 2010 after sending 'grossly offensive' letters to the families of Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan. Man Haron Monis  leaving court after he had been charged with seven counts of unlawfully using the postal service to menace, after sending harassing letters to families of Australian soldiers . Monis was sentenced to 300 hours community service in September last year for the letters he sent to the families of seven Australian soldiers killed between 2007 and 2009. In the letters, Monis likened soldiers to murderers and killers, and in one letter said the man was going to hell. Ini 2010 Monis wrote on his blog that he had sent the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown a letter informing him 'that I would like to send 237 baskets of flowers attached with 237 condolence letters to the families of the British soldiers who have been killed in Afghanistan since October 2001'. He claims Mr Brown 'on 7th January 2010 has thanked me for that'. But at a hearing in August 2013, he failed to overturn the order banning him from using the postal service to contact the families of military personnel. Speaking after the hearing, he said that meant he would not be allowed to send his 'very nice condolence letter' and '237 baskets of flowers' to the families of British soldiers who have been killed in Afghanistan since October 2001. 'Why not? Why shouldn't we offer our condolences?' he asked. 'There is nothing wrong in the letters I have sent.' He complained it was against his human right and 'if my family are the victims of a terrorist attack, I will not be able to contact them', the Telegraph revealed today. 'My relatives and family are an exception but if any friend in any terrorist attack (is) wounded or killed, first I should ask permission from the Australian Defence Force, then I can contact my friends to offer my condolences.' Emergency personnel wheel a blood soaked stretcher to an ambulance during a cafe siege in the central business district of Sydney . A hostage runs to armed tactical response police officers for safety after she escaped from a cafe under siege . Monis said the letters were meant to offer comfort and were different to the ones he had sent to Australian soldiers' families. He claimed an example would have been: 'I write to you to offer my condolences for the loss of a member of your family. 'I am so sorry that you have gone through a very hard time and I ask God to give you patience for that sad incident. 'I advise first myself and then you to believe in God deeply and by praying to God try to stay calm and strong during the difficult times. 'I hope one day, all nations including British and Afghani nations enjoy peace.'","Man Haron Monis said he wanted to send a 'very nice condolence letter'

"The terror attack on a Sydney cafe is well organised and designed for 'maximum publicity' and to create 'maximum impact' of terrorising Australians, a terrorism expert said. Professor Jeff Lewis of Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology said the armed man who has taken hostages inside the Lindt cafe had deliberately chosen iconic Martin Place and the cafe opposite the Seven Network office 'because it would get maximum publicity' and because it represented the spoils of Western society. Martin Place is one of Sydney's most distinguished shopping precincts with upmarket restaurants, cafes and bars, high-end fashion boutiques and designer shops including Giorgio Armani. Scroll down for video . Deliberately chosen: Martin Place was 'deliberately chosen' for the terror attack by Islamic extremists because it is iconic and represents what ISIS hates: Western wealth and capitalism . Maximum publicity: The terrorists chose a spot opposite Channel 7's Martin Place headquarters (above) to get maximum publicity to create terror and to attract followers . Carefully selected: The Lindt Cafe (pictured, just after hostages were taken inside) was strategic for the terrorists because it was a 'soft' target without security and located across from a television studio . Universal emblem: Profess Jeff Lewis said the use of the Shahada flag (pictured) by the terrorist did not necssarily mean he was from Jabhat al-Nusra, as the flag had universal appeal to devout Muslims . 'They have chosen a soft target, that is one that unlike the Sydney Opera House doesn't have security and therefore creates the maximum amount of fear,' Professor Lewis told Daily Mail Australia. 'Martin Place is iconic and represents what people in Islamic State (IS) detest in Western societies' because of its expensive shops, designer stores and other businesses surrounded by government offices and the big banks. 'We don't know yet who is behind this attack, but I wouldn't say it is necessarily Jabhat al-Nusra [the extremist Syrian-based group which uses the flag],' he said. Well organised: The terror attack was well-organised for mass publicity and maximum fear by chosing a 'soft' target in Martin Place (pictured) 'The Shahada flag is a kind of universal flag. The writing ""there is only one God"" is supported by every day Muslims in their devotions, and so they could be IS supporters using this flag.' Professor Lewis said IS had conducted a global promotion campaign over recent months to encourage people around the world 'to just act' and promote terror. 'They have been very active in trying to incite support the western world ,' he said. 'This attack could  be part of some network or co-ordinated plan. 'But it has been very well organised for maximum effect. Modern terrorism is about communication of its message, which is to terrorise its enemies but also to attract supporters.' Professor Lewis said the attack was 'the most audacious act of modern terrorism associated with Islam'. 'We have yet to learn what their objectives are, but the longer it goes on the more publicity they gain and they are achieving their objectives.' Professor Lewis is a professor of media and culture, specialising in terrorism.","Site of terror attack deliberately chosen and was 'well organised'

"A family who fell ill with severe vomiting and diarrhoea on holiday in Lanzarote have been awarded £3,200 in compensation. Sue Hilton, from Chesterfield, had travelled to the Flamingo Beach Resort with her mother and two children in February this year to enjoy a relaxing family holiday. Yet conditions at the hotel soon turned the holiday into a disaster. Food was reported to be served lukewarm, undercooked and often left uncovered in restaurants. Sue Hilton (right) and her daughter (left) who was 12 at the time, fell violently ill at the Flamingo Beach Resort . Flies were seen around the food, landing on fruits and cheeses. Miss Hilton also reported seeing cockroaches near eating areas and birds flying around indoor restaurants. Four days into the holiday, Miss Hilton's daughter, who was 12 years old at the time, began experiencing symptoms of severe stomach cramps, vomiting and diarrhoea. It was only a few days later, as the family returned home, that Miss Hilton began experiencing similar symptoms. Miss Hilton said: 'We were really looking forward to a relaxing family holiday but that was ruined by the conditions within the hotel. 'The food at the hotel was truly terrible and was never served at the right temperatures.' Miss Hilton had spoken to a number of guests who were affected by illness at the Flamingo Beach Resort. Despite complaining to representatives around the hotel, Miss Hilton felt little was being done to rectify the problems at the hotel. A general view of the Flamingo Bay Resort in Lanzarote, where two members of Mrs Hilton's family fell ill . On the family's return to the UK, Miss Hilton contacted her tour operator, First Choice, in order to register a complaint against the hotel. After receiving a number of offers, including the offer of vouchers towards another holiday, Miss Hilton contacted Your Holiday Claims, a division of Farnworth Rose solicitors. Head of travel law at Your Holiday Claims, Anne Thomson, said: 'We are delighted to have helped Miss Hilton and her family obtain compensation. 'When food and hygiene standards within hotels are poor, there is a risk of holidaymakers contracting serious illness. 'It is vital that all hotels ensure that high food hygiene standards are maintained in order to prevent such outbreaks of illness.'

"A Cincinnati Bengals player was hit in the face and pushed down to earth by rival fans after trying to leap up to the bleachers and celebrate a touchdown. Running back Jeremy Hill had just scored at an away game against the Cleveland Browns - his second touchdown of the match - and attempting the running leap towards waiting Bengals fans. But Browns supporters spotted him and denied his attempt as he charged towards the bleachers. Two fans pushed him back down to earth - one making contact with the player's face. Pushed to the ground: Cleveland Browns fans too issue with Jeremy Hill's attempt to celebrate his second touchdown of the game . The incident did little to brighten the fortunes of the Browns, who did not score a single point in the clash at the FirstEnergy Stadium in Cleveland, Ohio, and lost 30-0. Hill's touchdown came after a 16-yard run through the Browns defense. The first had been a more direct 2-yard run. The successes had been predicted by Hill, whose side lost to the Browns 24-3 in their last clash - though the running back was adamant the victors in that game were 'worse' than expected and 'didn't do anything special'. He kept his good humor despite the very physical put-down from the browns fans - who pointed and laughed afterwards. According to ESPN, Hill said: 'It was kind of funny - I'll learn from it next time.' Time to fly? Running back Hill charged towards the end of the stadium after the 16-yard run, and went to leap towards the bleachers .

"Jason Lewis has been jailed after his friend Tom Baynton died in a car crash caused when Lewis bent down to pick up his mobile phone while driving . A young driver has been jailed after he killed his best friend in a car crash after bending down to pick up his phone. Jason Lewis, 23, took his eyes off the road after dropping his phone under the pedals of his Peugeot 106 as he drove along a road in Ebbw Vale, South Wales. He lost control of the car as he twice tried to retrieve the phone and was in a head-on collision which killed his passenger and best friend, Tom Baynton. A court heard his car somersaulted onto its roof after the collision, which instantly killed popular footballer Mr Baynton, 21. Mr Baynton, who was in the front passenger seat, was awaiting the birth of his first child with partner Ella when the tragedy happened. A passenger in the other car, pensioner Rosalyn Webb, 66, was so badly injured in the crash she was in a coma for weeks and two other passengers were also injured. The court heard that Lewis, who escaped serious injury, had drunk two and a half pints of lager earlier that day, which had affected his driving even though he was under the legal limit. He was jailed for three years and nine months for causing death and serious injury by dangerous driving. Prosecutor Michael Jones said: 'He told police that his mobile phone slipped off the centre console, landing and getting stuck under the clutch pedal. 'In attempting to retrieve it he bent down and when he reached down a second time he lost his bearings and through panic lost control of the car.' Lewis' lawyer told the court that the young driver, who sat with head bowed for most of the proceedings, had shown 'heartfelt and genuine remorse'. She said: 'He made a terrible mistake and will have to live with the consequences for ever.' Mr Baynton - described as a 'true legend who loved life' by friends - died instantly in the accident last year . The court heard that six weeks after the tragedy, which happened in November 2013, Mr Baynton's partner gave birth to his baby son Leo. Lewis, of Abergavenny, Gwent, admitted both charges at Cardiff Crown Court. Judge Neil Bidder told him: 'You foolishly bent down to pick up the phone and repeated the action taking your eyes off the road. 'It was a crass thing to do and led to a terrible waste of life which was entirely avoidable. 'Although you were not over the drink driving limit you had consumed enough alcohol to have impaired your judgement. 'It is a great tragedy for the family of Mr Baynton who died never seeing his baby son and having a son who will never know his father.'","Friends  travelling along road in South Wales when driver dropped phone .

"Corey Pye, 21, from Basingstoke said he is facing a lifetime of debt after his phone was stolen three days into his week-long trip on the Balearic Island . A holidaymaker who lost his iPhone in Ibiza has received a bill from Vodafone for £19,000 after failing to tell the firm it was missing for five days. Corey Pye, 21, from Basingstoke said he was facing a lifetime of debt after his phone was stolen three days into his week-long trip on the Balearic Island. He assumed the iPhone 4s could not be used because it was password protected and only reported it stolen when he returned home in September. But he was horrified when a bill for £6,439.76 landed on his doormat a few days later. Realising he had made a mistake he took out a 36-month personal loan to pay off the debt, but when his next monthly bill came through it was £12,450.35. 'It's ruined my Christmas. I don't know what to do. I was so shocked when I got the bill,' he said. 'I'm a young lad and this will be hanging over me for the rest of my life. I'm still paying off that six grand off. 'I shouldn't be punished for the naivety of failing to report my mobile missing, or for the criminal acts of others who are the ones profiting from this.' Mr Pye has been a Vodafone customer all his adult life and his contract includes unlimited UK calls, unlimited texts and 1GB of internet for £17.50 a month, but not overseas calls . His first bill included his £17.50 contract fee £0.41 for messaging and mobile internet and £5,348.56 for calls with £1,073.29 in VAT. Mr Pye said Vodafone offered him little assistance in clearing the debt, so he decided to face up to his mistake and took out a loan to pay it back in November. But on December 4 he received a second demand for £12,450.35 because, according to Vodafone, the first bill did not cover the whole period before the number was cut off. This bill breaks down as £17.50 for the contract, £10,350.11 for calls, an admin fee of £2.94, a late payment fee of £4.17, a copy bill charge of £2.54 and VAT of £2,074.36. He is now in negotiation with the mobile phone giant over the second bill. When he returned home and reported it missing he received a bill for £6,439 which included £17.50 contract fee £0.41 for messaging and mobile internet and £5,348.56 for calls with £1,073.29 in VAT . On December 4 he received a second demand for £12,450.35 which included more than £10,350.11 for calls . But he is furious that the company allowed such a huge bill to be accrued without cutting off the phone. He said: 'Vodafone should not have allowed such ridiculous call charges to go uncapped. 'They are really useless at helping out. They will just hang up or say they will contact you in three days. 'I can't afford to pay the rest so I have to fight it. 'They won't give me a final date on when this will be resolved, if it even will be. 'I have a new 24 month contract with them. I can't even leave them. I have been a customer with them all my life and I get this.' Since publicising his story, a spokesman for Vodafone said he would only be held liable for £500 of the fraudulent charges. 'It is very easy for criminals to rapidly build up high charges using stolen phones, which is why we encourage customers to report phones missing as quickly as possible,' said the spokesman. 'Customers are liable for charges up to the point they report the phone missing and we have the opportunity to bar it. 'However, this would appear to be part of organised criminal activity and in recent weeks we have reviewed the extent of that liability in these cases. 'Following a review, Mr Pye will be liable for £500 worth of the fraudulent charges. We will contact Mr Pye to make arrangements to reimburse the payments already made less £500.'

"Extraordinary new research has emerged suggesting Peter Kassig's beheading was faked by ISIS, and that the U.S. aid worker was killed by a gunshot, not decapitated by Jihadi John as implied. Medical experts examining an ISIS propaganda video in which Mr Kassig's severed head is seen at the feet of ISIS' British executioner in chief, have concluded that he is likely to have been shot dead. The claims add further weight to speculation over why Mr Kassig's full body was not shown in the video. Unlike ISIS' previous sickening filmed murders, he did not speak directly to camera before being killed and his body was not shown after the murder. A popular theory is that Mr Kassig was killed before the video was shot because he did not cooperate with the jihadists - either refusing to give a final speech on camera or possibly even fighting back while the murder was taking place. Scroll down for video . Claims: New research has emerged suggesting Peter Kassig's beheading was faked by ISIS, and that the U.S. aid worker (pictured) was killed by a gunshot, not decapitated by Jihadi John as implied . Faked: Shadows cast by Jihadi John do not match the alignment of the sun and suggest the digital editing programme Avid - which costs around £200,000 - had been used to superimpose him into shots . Detailed examination of the murder video - in which 22 Syrian soldiers were also filmed being brutally beheaded by a group of unmasked ISIS killers - suggests that Mr Kassig was killed with a single gunshot wound to the head before being decapitated. Charlie Winter, a researcher at Quilliam - counter-extremism think tank that will be publishing the analysis this week - told The Telegraph: 'We have had a senior face and neck surgeon independently look at some of the screenshots we took.' 'His initial assessment was that a contusion  above Mr Kassig's left eye was a gunshot wound. Closer analysis of the wound reinforced that initial assessment, leading him to believe that the wound was probably the cause of death, rather than beheading,' he added. Digital analysis of the film also suggests that Jihadi John may have been superimposed in the frame where he is seen standing over Mr Kassig's severed head. The raises the question of whether Mr Kassig was murdered in an entirely different location to the Syrian soldiers. It is understood that shadows supposedly cast by Jihadi John do not match up with the alignment of the sun and that the digital editing programme Avid - which costs around £200,000 and is used in Hollywood - had been used to add shadows, albeit in an amateur fashion. Sickening: The latest ISIS video showed a group of Syrian soldiers being marched along a desert road in Dabiq and brutally murdered by a large number of unmasked militants . Unusual: Peter Kassig is pictured while working as an aid worker in Syria before his capture. His murder is not actually shown in the film and he does not deliver a final message as other Western hostages have . Another alternative claim emerged just days after Mr Kassig's death and suggested that the aid worker could have been accidentally killed in a U.S.-led airstrike. Speaking over Skype from a hiding place near the Turkish border, the head of the anti-ISIS resistance group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently claimed there are reports that Mr Kassig died on November 5, when coalition fighter planes and drones pounded Tel-Abyad in northern Syria. The resistance leader, a 22 year old medical student who uses the nom de guerre Abu Ibrahim Raqqawi, said in an interview: 'I think ISIS didn't execute Peter. An ISIS soldier told me this morning that Peter died in an airstrike on 5th November in Tel-Abyad and that is why they didn't show a video of the execution. 'The soldier was one of the first who arrived on the scene to secure it after an airstrike hit the Islamic State court building in Tel-Abyad. He said there was immediate high security and nobody was permitted entry to the building, not even ISIS fighters. Then two bodies were taken out of the building and put into a speeding car.' Mr Raqqawi claims that the soldier said one of the bodies was that of Mr Kassig.","Mr Kassig's severed head was seen in a sickening ISIS murder video .

"A broken down bus carrying around 50 people was hit by a lorry on a busy road this morning, sparking a major emergency operation. Three people were injured in the smash, including one seriously, which happened at around 12.30am today. The bus, which had broken down on the side of the A34 at Drayton, Oxfordshire, was a rail replacement service carrying passengers from Oxford to Didcot. South Coast Ambulance Service said five people were taken to the John Radcliffe Hospital. Horrific: One person is in a life-threatening condition after a lorry was involved in a collision with a rail replacement bus that had broken down at the side of the the A34 at Drayton, Oxfordshire . Pictures from the scene appeared to show that the lorry involved in the crash was a DHL vehicle. The company has yet to comment on the incident . One patient is in a life-threatening condition, another two have serious injuries and two have minor injuries. A passenger has spoken of the terrifying moment the vehicle was shunted off the road. Adam Graves said smokers who were stood outside the stricken bus appeared to have been clipped by the vehicle as it was thrown forward and down an embankment by a lorry operated by the DHL delivery firm. Another man who was sitting at the back of the bus, where the lorry hit, had to be pulled free from his seat after becoming trapped. Mr Graves said many people fled the vehicle through a smashed window as the smell of petrol sparked fears of an explosion. Three people were rushed from the scene to hospital, one in a serious condition, while others were treated at the roadside and at a nearby police station for minor injuries. The rail replacement bus service was carrying around 50 people from Oxford to Didcot when it broke down on the southbound carriageway of the A34 near Drayton, Oxon., at around 12.30am today/yesterday (Mon). Many of the people on the bus had been at a Taking Back Sunday concert at Oxford's O2 Academy last/on Sunday night, according to Mr Graves. The 21-year-old NHS contractor said there were chaotic scenes after the bus was hit. A picture of the scene posted on Twitter. One passenger said 'it was nuts' inside the vehicle . 'The bus driver said there was a loss of power and we pulled over to the side,' said Mr Graves, who was travelling with friends. 'I was on my phone and suddenly the bus moved forward, like it had been jump-started. There was quite a loud bang. 'All of a sudden it was turning round and I was falling out of my seat. 'People started screaming. I don't think many people were wearing their seatbelts so they were flying around and hitting their heads.' Mr Graves, who escaped with cuts and bruises, said the front door of the coach was up in the air after the vehicle went onto its side and there was a broken window which some people climbed out of. 'There was one guy who was trapped in his seat,' said Mr Graves, from Didcot. 'I think he had broken his legs. He was sat right at the back where the lorry hit. 'There was a couple of us who helped to pull him out. One guy was breaking the seat so he could get free.' Mr Graves said moments before the stricken bus was hit a group of people got off to have a cigarette. 'They thought we were going to be there a while so a few got off to smoke and then maybe 30 seconds later the crash happened,' he said. 'I think at least one of them got clipped by the bus and was badly hurt. The rest were in shock. 'There were a couple of people with quite a bit of blood on their faces and cuts. It was a very crazy scene.' Passengers who did not need hospital treatment were taken to Abingdon police station. The three people injured during the crash were all passengers on the rail replacement service but police were yet to confirm the age or sex of those hurt. Their next of kin had been informed of the incident. Pictures from the scene appeared to show that the lorry involved in the crash was a DHL vehicle. A spokesperson for the delivery and logistics company said: 'We can confirm that one of our vehicles was involved in a serious road traffic incident on the A34 this morning between the Botley and Milton interchanges. 'We are cooperating fully with the police in their enquiries. While these are underway we are unable to comment further except to say the safety of the public and our drivers remains paramount to us.' Thames Valley Police said the driver of the lorry, who was uninjured, had been spoken to and that no arrests had been made in connection with the collision. Fire and ambulance crews also attended the scene and Abingdon police station, where passengers were taken following the crash, was being used as a triage centre by South Central Ambulance Service. Police said officers had been taking statements from passengers at the station and that many had now been able to go home. The southbound carriageway was expected to remain closed until at least 10am today as clean up operations and collision investigations continued at the scene. A Thames Valley Police spokesman said: 'The A34 southbound is still closed between Botley and Milton interchanges as Thames Valley Police and partner agencies continue to clear the carriageway following the earlier road traffic collision. 'Thames Valley Police is working on recovering the vehicles involved in the collision which took place at 12.30am this morning. 'After the recovery process is complete, the Highways Agency will deploy its carriageway maintenance vehicles to sweep and grit the carriageway when the scene is handed over to them. 'It is essential up to this time that users of the A34 southbound continue to use the black triangle in yellow box diversion route and listen to local media for news regarding opening up times. 'The next of kin of the three people injured in the collision have all been informed of the incident.' The crash was causing long delays for commuters on the A34, with many taking to Twitter in despair at the disruption. One driver said it took him 70 minutes to do an 18-mile commute while another, Nathan, tweeted: 'Parked with engine off... Gotta love the A34.' He later added: 'Not moving again! Could be further behind I suppose...Looking for a positive.' The bus was a replacement for the 00.05am First Great Western service from Oxford to Didcot.","One patient is in a life-threatening condition,  two have serious injuries .

"English MPs could have the power to veto new laws affecting England under plans to ensure 'fairness' for everyone in the UK. William Hague announced the idea is one of three being considered to tackle the issue of English votes for English laws. It follows concern that Scottish MPs could have the deciding vote on legislation which only applies south of the border. Home rule: The proposals by William Hague (left) could stop Alex Salmond voting on English-only issues if he is elected as a Westminster MP. Mr Salmond (right, campaigning yesterday) will stand for a seat in May . Mr Hague today published the proposals aimed at delivering 'English votes for English laws'. Under the most radical option, English MPs would have a separate vote in which they could veto an legislation - forcing the Government either to abandon the proposals or make changes to secure majority support. Another option would mean English-only bills would go to an English-only grand committee at second reading and the remaining stages would be governed by a convention that means MPs from other nations would not vote. A final option sets out plans that would allow only English MPs to consider the amending stages of legislation that relates only to England but the final vote would be open to all MPs. All three proposals would involve Welsh MPs where legislation also relates to Wales. Mr Hague told the Commons: 'This is a fundamental issue of fairness for all the people of the United Kingdom. Just as the people of Scotland will have more power over their affairs, so it follows the people of England, Wales and Northern Ireland must have the opportunity to have a bigger say over theirs.' Labour has declined to take part in cross-party discussions on constitutional reform for England once Scotland is handed powers over tax, welfare and public spending. But senior Tories are determined to force a vote in the Commons on the issue early in the New Year. They argue that Scottish MPs should be barred from having the final say on laws that only affect England, given Scotland's new rights to determine its own affairs. And Conservative Right-wingers are warning Downing Street that anything less than full-scale reform will prompt a rebellion against Scottish devolution. Labour has indicated that it will only back the weakest form of 'English votes for English laws'. But Downing Street is thought to be backing the idea of an English veto. National differences: English MPs could set English-only laws under plans for increased devolution . Following a committee stage of English MPs, legislation could be amended by MPs from the rest of the UK in the Commons. But English MPs would then get a final 'veto vote' before a Bill became law. David Cameron surprised opponents by promising 'English votes for English laws' in the hours after September's Scottish independence referendum result – insisting that like Scotland, England must now be given more power over its own affairs. Barring Scottish MPs from voting on key affairs would permanently hobble Labour's powerbase at Westminster, given the party's reliance on the support of its 41 MPs north of the border. At the last election, the Conservatives won 296 of 533 MPs in England and would have had an overall majority of 59 in England. The last Labour government passed several key pieces of legislation – including that of introducing foundation hospitals and tuition fees – thanks to the votes of Scottish MPs whose constituents were unaffected, given Holyrood's control over health and education policy. Now a cross-party deal following Scotland's rejection of independence will see it also take control of income tax, VAT revenues and the introduction of new benefits. On the warpath: New SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon visited Number 10 Downing Street yesterday . Scottish Nationalists last night signed a provocative electoral pact with the Greens and Welsh Nationalists that paves the way for a deal putting Ed Miliband in power in the event of another hung Parliament. Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, on course to seize dozens of Labour seats at next year's general election, came to Westminster to forge a 'progressive' alliance against the Tories. Fears are growing that the election could produce an effective dead heat between the main parties – with only a 'rainbow coalition' of three or more parties able to govern. The SNP has indicated that in such circumstances, it would not prop up a Conservative-led government – but could offer support to Labour in return for a series of concessions. Miss Sturgeon also paid a visit to Downing Street for her first meeting with David Cameron since she became First Minister. The Prime Minister confirmed that youngsters aged 16 and 17 will be able to vote in the next Holyrood election. He said he would devolve the power to decide the franchise in time for the 2016 poll. A senior Government source said: 'This question has now become unavoidable. We want a vote in the New Year. The middle ground is for English MPs to have a veto over anything that is going through in their name, but for the rest of the Commons to have votes at various stages.' The source said the plan for an English-only committee was 'out of date' because it had been prepared before the latest round of devolution to Holyrood had been agreed. It was suggested by former Commons clerk Sir William McKay, and backed by Labour. 'McKay himself says that given the scale of devolution to Scotland, his proposal will need to be revised,' the source said. 'It was predicated on a very different constitutional situation. It is important English MPs genuinely get the decisive say.' Tory Right-wingers have warned of a rebellion against Scottish devolution unless there is full-scale reform on the English votes issue. Former Cabinet minister John Redwood said: 'We don't vote on Scottish laws and they shouldn't vote on English laws. It is just equality.' Tory MP Brian Binley said: 'The English people… don't want another layer of government; they want a straightforward English votes for English laws.' A poll published today by Saga found that 76 per cent of over 50s in all four parts of the UK backed the view that Welsh, Northern Irish and Scottish MPs should be excluded from voting in Westminster on matters affecting England where those matters have been devolved to their respective assembles.","Reform plans unveiled today to give English MPs a greater say .

"Ralph Cerminara, president of Australian Defence League, burst into an angry rant and had to be escorted away by police after an outburst near the Lindt Chocolat Cafe in central Sydney as the hostage crisis continued. ‘Half the reason we've got this problem today is because of left wing bigots... These people may be murdered because of your left wing bigotry... It's finally happened!’ Cerminara shouted angrily before being taken away by police. Cerminara’s flare-up was an ominous warning of the backlash the Muslim community could face when the siege is finally resolved. And a terrorism expert agreed, saying that racist attacks targeting Australia's Muslim community are ‘quite likely’. Scroll down for video . Australian Defence League president Ralph Cerminara is lead away by police after an angry rant near the Lindt Chocolat Cafe during the hostage crisis . Ben Rich, a researcher into political violence at Monash University's School of Social Sciences, said some Australian Muslims could face reprisal due to the incident in Sydney. ""I can't say to what extent it's going to be, but I'd say it's quite likely,"" Mr Rich said. He predicted that any violence would probably not be ‘organised by any particular political party’ but was more likely to be ""just a group of guys deciding ‘let's go do something, let's go attack someone'.’ He pointed to reprisal attacks against Muslims following recent terror acts in Chechnya and in England after the killing of British soldier Lee Rigby in 2013. 'This type of thing brings out a lot of latent tensions in people,' Mr Rich added. However, the Grand Mufti of Australia, Professor Ibrahim Abu Mohamed said he and the Australian National Imams Council are devastated by the incident in Martin Place. The Grand Mufti of Australia, Professor Ibrahim Abu Mohamed, unequivocally condemned the hostage situation . ‘[We] condemn this criminal act unequivocally and reiterate that such actions are denounced in part and in whole in Islam,"" he said in a statement. ‘We along with the wider Australian society await the results of the investigation about the identity of the perpetrators and their underlying motivations behind this criminal act.’ The former president of the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils Rehin Ghauri agreed, saying he was more worried about the welfare of the hostages inside the cafe than about the possibility of reprisals against Muslims. ‘I'm concerned about my Australian brothers and sisters,’ Mr Ghauri said. ‘We view every event like this with grave concern... Holding people hostage like this is totally, absolutely and honestly un-Islamic.’ New South Wales Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione says authorities have moved to a 'footing' similar to dealing with a terrorist attack. NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione confirmed that security had been upped . Meanwhile, during the hostage negotiations at Martin Place, a man broke past the police cordon and had to be restrained by two officers, who told him to stay behind the tape. He pleaded with them to let him negotiate with the hostage taker and said he would willingly stand outside and ‘invite’ the hostage taker to talk to him. ‘All I'm saying is you need someone, outside of the media and stand outside and say, what have you come for?’ A police officer told him: ‘Thanks for your input.’","Australian Defence League president Ralph Cerminara is taken away by police after furious rant .

"David Gale, 51 (pictured outside an earlier court hearing), set up bank accounts and online Betfair accounts in the name of his ex-wife before swindling cash of friends, family and his partner . A fraudster who swindled nearly £2million from his in-laws, friends and new partner in a Ponzi-style sports betting scheme which funded his gambling addiction, luxury holidays and mortgage, has been jailed for seven years. David Gale, 51, set up bank accounts and online Betfair accounts in the name of his ex-wife Faye and convinced her father and grandfather to part with their cash for the 'scheme'. The 51-year-old financial adviser, from Chichester, West Sussex, promised investors he had found a 'magic formula', which would guarantee huge, risk-free profits if they signed up. However, he instead conned them out of hundreds of thousands of pounds including his father-in-law who lost £145,000, his grandfather-in-law who lost £2,000 and his new partner who was swindled out of £800,000. In total, he used his trusted position as a member of the family or as financial adviser to trick over 30 people into handing money in the so-called 'foolproof' online football betting scheme between 2008 and 2011. Instead of investing the money as promised, he withdrew the cash immediately, splurging it on home refurbishments, holidays, shopping and fine wines. His spending included £31,000 to pay off his mortgage, £7,000 for school fees, £15,000 for home improvements, £31,000 on leisure activities and holidays, £46,000 on shopping and £8,000 on fine wines. During the swindle, he declared he had no income on his tax returns. Wearing a grey shirt and a beige blazer, he showed no emotion in the dock as he was sentenced at Guildford Crown Court to six years for fraud charges and one year for unauthorised regulated activity, to run consecutively, on Friday. Sentencing him, Judge Christopher Critchlow said: 'The type and nature are extremely serious fraud offences breaching the trust of family and friends. 'I've been told it's all to do with your gambling. 'Those involved have been affected to a lesser and greater degree by your fraud and complete dishonesty. 'Beverley Rutland said you've completely destroyed her life. 'Mirren Mace said: ""What you've done so brazenly and dishonestly is hard to come to terms with"".' The court heard how his ex-wife's grandfather Maurice Mitford was one of the first investors to sign up to the scheme, losing £2,000, while her father Philip Landreth lost £145,000, forcing him out of his retirement and back into full-time employment to try and make ends meet. In total, Gale lost £1.8million of the £2.3million pounds given to him to 'invest' securely by nine friends and family members, frittering it away betting on sports, dog and horse racing and traditional casino events. He withdrew some funds to pay 'dividends' to his investors to fool them into thinking the collective investment scheme was profitable and had his then-wife and a new partner fooled too, the court heard. Mrs Gale previously told how she was 'swept off her feet' when she met her husband, who is 13 years her senior, at Royal Ascot in 2004. The seven-year marriage ended when his scheming, implicating her, was uncovered in 2011, and the pair remain separated but not yet divorced. He immediately left the family home in Great Bookham, Surrey, where the couple lived with their two children and moved to Little London in Chichester, West Sussex. Mrs Gale, 37, previously appeared in the dock alongside her former husband, charged with aiding and abetting him, but Judge Robert Fraser told her this would lie on file. She was described as 'completely innocent' regarding what her husband was up to, saying her ex-partner's explanations of his fail-safe betting system was 'all Greek' to her. David Gale (left) and his ex-wife Faye (pictured right at an earlier court hearing) both attended Guildford Crown Court, where David admitted using bank and Betfair accounts in his ex-wife's name to con people . Her ex-husband had complete access to her finances, opening bank accounts in her name to which she never had access, the court heard. The mother of two said she had been duped just like the investors, had never used the Betfair gambling site herself and didn't even know the passwords to the accounts. Mr Gale convinced his investors to part with more cash by telling them he had been offered Betfair shares at a preferential rate because he was such a good customer. Prosecuting, Alison Clare said: 'It was simply a complete and utter fiction. 'He told people he had discovered a 'magic formula. Of course, there was no secret formula.' When his spending caught up with him and the ruse became untenable in March 2011, Gale sent an email to many of his investors saying a 'disastrous sequence of events,' meant he had lost all their money by pressing a 'wrong button' on the computer while betting. The conman then said the only way he would be able to win back their money would be if they invested a further £100,000 in a new fund, which he promised would give 100 per cent returns. Most of his victims began to fear they had been defrauded on a monumental scale, but incredibly some continued to give persuasive Gale their money - including 71-year-old Christine Burnett, who had been introduced to Gale through his father. The lonely and vulnerable woman became close to Gale after her husband died in November 2008, leaving her with property and significant finances. She was said to have felt sorry for Gale for losing his money and his wife. The pair started a romantic relationship, during which time Gale invested over £800,000 of her money and set up Betfair accounts in her name, as he had done previously under his ex-wife's name. Some £665,000 of this money was lost through gambling and theft, leaving elderly Mrs Burnett 'knocked for six,' with debts, a shattered credit rating, and her family without an inheritance. 'Looking back, Mr Gale must have thought I was sitting on a fortune,' she said. Gale admitted the charges at Guildford Crown Court (pictured) and was sentenced to seven years in prison . Friend Beverley Rutland invested £390,000 and lost £260,000 to Gale, while Keith Durston invested £65,000 and lost £51,000. Defending, John Dye said a repentant Gale had a 'long-standing' gambling problem for which he had been receiving treatment during his three years on bail. 'He now knows it (the betting scheme) was wholly optimistic and was always doomed to fail,' he said. 'The problem with gamblers is they bury their head in the sand trying to chase their losses to try and make a profit.' At an earlier hearing Mrs Gale was found liable for hundreds of thousands of pounds when family friend, Kathleen O'Neill sued for the £300,000 she had invested in the Ponzi-style scheme. Last March, Judge David Donaldson QC cleared the London-based TV producer of any dishonesty but ruled that she would still have to cover the costs of Mr Gale's losses in her name. She took it to the Court of Appeal in December but three top judges ruled against her. Mr Gale was handed down a six-year jail sentence for fraud and one year for unauthorised regulated activity for carrying out financial activity while banned, to run consecutively. Judge Critchlow gave him jail time for each of the 34 charges, with other sentences ranging from eighteen months to six years to run concurrently. A Financial Reporting Order was made for ten years and confiscation proceedings will be started to see if any money can be won back for the victims of the betting scam.","David Gale, 51, admitted using bank and Betfair accounts in ex-wife's name .

"Shops are keeping customers in the dark about their right to get repairs or refunds on faulty goods for up to six years after they bought them. Many are denying any responsibility for helping customers once a product is outside its official warranty, which is wrong under consumer laws, say researchers. Others are bouncing customers to manufacturers, when the law states that the retailer is responsible for dealing with complaints about products. Scroll down for video . Refund: Customers could argue their case for a washing machine that breaks after up to six years . The problem relates to the fact that consumer rights laws are extremely complicated with many grey areas, and that shop staff seem ignorant of the rules. The Sale of Goods Act gives consumers some rights to refunds or free repairs for up to six years after the purchase of an item, which most do not realise. But these only apply if the product could reasonably have been expected to last six years or more and where it has been used properly, according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Consequently, a customer could argue that a washing machine or TV could be expected to last six years, but the same could not be said of a hairdryer. The consumer must also be able to show that a product has failed because it was not sufficiently robust when it was sold, which might require an expert report. But the scale of any redress is limited by the fact that the product has been used by the owner for a period of time. That means the owner could not expect a full refund on a £500 TV that has been used for five years. Researchers at the consumer group Which? went under cover to ask staff at high street and internet retailers what customers’ rights are when an electrical product becomes faulty outside its warranty. They also asked to speak to managers to see if they offered better information. The responses Which? received were rated under five headings, ‘excellent’, ‘good’, ‘fair’, ‘poor’ and ‘very poor’. Those judged as excellent accepted there were some rights and gave clear, accurate advice. Poor staff created the impression that the shopper had no rights and should speak to the manufacturer, while those rated as ‘very poor’ denied the customer had any rights. Argos came out worst with nine out of 12 shop staff rated as poor or very poor. John Lewis prides itself on its customer service, but eight out of 12 staff were rated poor or very poor, which was the same as at Currys. At Richer Sounds, seven out of 12 fell into the bottom two categories, while the score for Amazon was six out of 12. The best performer was Apple, where only three out of 12 rated poor or very poor. All its managers offered a decent level of advice. Which? said: ‘Currys was the only retailer to score an excellent rating for one of its shopfloor staff.’ The consumer group said the stores have improved the way they handle these queries since it surveyed them a year ago. Argos said its staff are given training on consumer law. A spokesman said: ‘We accept our responsibility to ensure customers are given correct guidance when a problem arises.’ John Lewis said: ‘Our partners are trained to approach all customer problems with an open mind and the customer’s best interests to the fore.’ Currys said: ‘We don’t feel the research reflects how we assist customers. We deliver beyond the legal requirement.’ Richer Sounds said: ‘We work hard to provide exceptional customer service and value.’ Amazon said: ‘We take into consideration all facts and circumstances on a case-by-case basis to provide a fair solution.’","Sale of Goods Act gives partial refund rights stretching up to six years .

"Residents of Mosul have been banned from leaving by Isis, which has cut the phone lines and locked down the Iraqi city in preparation for an expected assault by government forces, it has been reported. Resentment has grown among residents living under the iron-fisted rule of the extremists in the country's second-largest city – and now they have no option but to endure it. One local, Ghazwan, told how Isis will only allow people to leave for a maximum of 10 days. Scroll down for video . Residents of Mosul have been banned from leaving by Isis (pictured in the city's main street), which has cut the phone lines and locked down the Iraqi city in preparation for an expected assault by government forces . He told The Daily Telegraph during a visit to Baghdad: 'You have to bring a guarantor to say you will come back in 10 days. If you don't come back, they are punished. People are trying to leave Mosul. They closed the hospitals because they have no electricity or water.' Another resident told the paper that the phones had been cut for security reasons, as the jihadists feared that locals were revealing their military positions to government forces. Local Saadi Abdul-Rahman said he was recently forced to pull his three children out of school. The cost of living has soared there, and the family is barely able to make ends meet, even after putting the kids to work. 'We are not able to pay for cooking gas, kerosene and food,' the 56-year old retired government worker says. 'The situation in Mosul is miserable.' The economy in the self-styled 'caliphate' declared by the Islamic State group bridging Iraq and Syria is starting to show signs of strain. Prices of most staples have more than doubled as coalition airstrikes and ground operations make it difficult for products to move in and out of militant strongholds, leading to shortages, price-gouging and the creation of black markets. The economy in the self-styled 'caliphate' declared by the Islamic State group bridging Iraq and Syria is starting to show signs of strain . Members of the Iraqi security forces carry their weapons during an intensive security deployment on the outskirts of Samarra, a city lying to the south of Mosul . The jihadists initially won support with their ability to deliver services. In the early days of its rule, the Islamic State group subsidized food and gas prices through the wealth it accumulated from oil smuggling, extortion and ransom demands. They sold their smuggled oil at a discount- $25 to $60 for a barrel for oil that normally sold for more than $100, according to analysts and government officials. But in recent weeks, prices have soared in militant-held cities. Items like kerosene, used for heating and cooking, are in short supply, while others, such as alcohol and cigarettes, strictly banned by the group, are making a comeback at higher prices on the black market. Smoking is a punishable offense in militant-held Mosul. But at a warehouse on the outskirts of the city, cigarettes, as well as hard-to-come-by essentials like kerosene, can be found at hugely inflated prices on a black market run by the extremists. There, a pack of cigarettes sells for 30,000 dinars - the equivalent of $26 - more than double the pre-caliphate price, according to residents who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals. The militants 'are developing an unsustainable economy,' said Paul Sullivan, an expert on Middle East economies at the National Defense University in Washington. 'Eventually the costs of keeping the subsidies and price controls going will overpower their smuggling funds, which are also used for offensive and defensive actions.' A member of the Iraqi security forces takes his position with his weapon during an intensive security deployment on the outskirts of Samarra, south of Mosul . 'ISIL cannot float government bonds like nations can,' Sullivan added, using an alternate acronym for the group. 'They can collect taxes, extort money, and so forth. But that will likely not be enough in the long run to keep such an unbalanced economic system going.' In the Syrian city of Raqqa, the extremists' so-called capital, the breakdown of security along the Syria-Iraq border in areas under Islamic State control has led to flourishing trade with Mosul. Trucks are also able to access the city from Turkey, residents said, allowing for a steady supply of fruit and vegetables, wheat and textiles. However, the cost of living has surged since U.S.-led airstrikes began in Syria in September, and power and water cuts grew more frequent, they said. In addition, the strict social laws imposed by the group have been very bad for business, said Bari Abdelatif, an activist in the Islamic State-controlled town of al-Bab in Syria's northern Aleppo province. But, he said, foreign fighters were bringing with them lots of hard currency, making up somewhat for the shortfall. Last month, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State group, decreed the minting of gold, silver and copper coins for the militants' own currency - the Islamic dinar - to 'change the tyrannical monetary system' modelled on Western economies. However, trade in most militant-held cities continues to be in Iraqi dinars and U.S. dollars. The start of winter has led to serious shortages of gasoline and kerosene in Iraq's militant-held territories. The official price for a liter of gas in government-controlled areas is 450 dinars (40 cents)- but in Mosul, it sells for four times that, or 1,700 dinars. Two hundred-liter barrels of kerosene are now sold in Mosul for 250,000 dinars ($220), versus the official price of 30,000 dinars. In the western Iraqi city of Fallujah, under militant control for almost a year, residents have started cutting trees for firewood because kerosene is in such short supply. The city is surrounded by government troops and near-daily shelling often make parts of town too dangerous to visit. Food and fuel prices have risen sharply as a result - a 50-kilo sack of rice costs 75,000 dinars ($65), up from 10,000 ($9) about three months ago. A cylinder of cooking gas goes for 140,000 dinars ($115). A number of factors are driving the shortages and price hikes, according to residents in Mosul and Fallujah, the group's biggest Iraqi strongholds. The militants have imposed a tax on trucks and other vehicles entering their territory, which has led to a decline in business. Deliveries are also subject to militant theft, and coalition airstrikes and military operations make many roads impassable. As a result, the trip from the Turkish border to Mosul took four hours prior to the militant takeover. Now, a delivery truck can spend as much as a week traveling the same road, and will ultimately pay a tax of as much as $300 for entry into Mosul, residents said. According to Luay al-Khateeb, director of the Iraqi Energy Institute and a visiting fellow at the Brookings Doha Center, the population of the areas the Islamic State group controls in Iraq and Syria is 6.5 million to 8 million people. 'They need 150,000 barrels (of crude) a day just to meet local consumption,' he said. 'And that is the bare minimum to meet the demands for transportation, bakeries, power generation.' 'That doesn't mean they have access to such supply,' he added. Last month, the militants shut down cell phone service in Mosul, claiming that residents were tipping off U.S.-led coalition airstrikes to their whereabouts. Cell signals have not been restored, causing the city to come to a virtual standstill. Workshops, factories and markets are closed and bitterness is growing among business owners. 'Most money-transfer operations are done by mobile calls,' said Osama Abdul-Aziz, the owner of a money-transfer office in Mosul. 'We have the option of using the Internet, but this method is very slow and sometimes the Internet does not work at all, which causes big delays to our work.' At Mohammed Abdullah's shop in Mosul, the pile of cell phone scratch cards is growing higher by the day. 'Our business and means for living are in ruins now,' he said. Meanwhile, Islamic State group militants shot down an Iraqi military helicopter on Saturday, officials said, killing the two pilots onboard and raising fresh concerns about the extremists' ability to attack aircraft. The attack happened in the Shiite holy city of Samarra, about 95 kilometers (60 miles) north of Baghdad. A member of the Iraqi security forces walks past a destroyed vehicle belonging to Islamic State militants during an intensive security deployment on the outskirts of Samarra . A senior Defense Ministry official told The Associated Press the Sunni militants used a shoulder-fired rocket launcher to shoot down the EC635 helicopter on the outskirts of the city. An army official corroborated the information. Both spoke on condition of anonymity as they weren't authorized to speak to journalists. The EC635, built by Airbus Helicopters, is used for transport, surveillance and combat. The militants shot down at least two other Iraqi military helicopters near the city of Beiji in October. Some fear the militants may have captured ground-to-air missiles capable of shooting down airplanes when they overran Iraqi and Syrian army bases this summer. European airlines including Virgin Atlantic, KLM and Air France, U.S. carrier Delta Air Lines and Dubai-based Emirates changed their commercial flight plans over the summer to avoid Iraqi airspace. The U.S.-trained Iraqi military virtually collapsed in the face of the militants' blitz, shedding their uniforms and abandoning sophisticated weapons near the northern city of Mosul.

"Warning: Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe says forthcoming cuts in police budgets will endanger the public unless ‘radical action’ is taken . The public will be put at risk unless police forces merge to save costs, Britain’s most senior officer warned last night. Scotland Yard commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe called for the traditional landscape of policing to be ripped up, replacing 43 forces across England and Wales with nine regional ‘super forces’. He has warned that forthcoming cuts in police budgets will endanger the public unless ‘radical action’ is taken. Setting out his blueprint for reform, he said there has been a shift in the types of crime that officers deal with, and offences such as cybercrime and online child sexual exploitation often transcend force boundaries. Echoing a recent report by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary which said forces were stuck in a time warp, using out-dated methods to deal with modern-day offences, Sir Bernard said that criminals are moving from the shotgun robberies of the past to more sophisticated offences – and police need to catch up. ‘There’s a bigger risk to public safety if we don’t take radical action,’ he said. ‘We’ve saved hundreds of millions already, but from 2016 onwards it will be much harder.’ Eight years ago, the Labour government tried unsuccessfully to streamline the number of forces in England and Wales. But since then there have been renewed calls to consider the idea. The Commissioner’s intervention comes as Home Secretary Theresa May faces MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee today. She will be questioned about cuts after the chief of Lincolnshire police warned last week that his force would be out of business if budgets shrink. On Wednesday, the Home Office will tell forces about more cuts, with police fearing they will be bigger than the 20 per cent reductions suffered since 2010. The Commissioner’s intervention comes as Home Secretary Theresa May faces MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee today . Police chiefs have warned that the scale of the cuts to come could see neighbourhood policing decimated and patrols axed amid fears there might only be enough officers to respond to emergencies. Sir Bernard cited domestic abuse as an example where many agencies can be involved in a case. ‘Society’s ability to reduce abuse is much more than a policing issue,’ he said. ‘It’s about a range of agencies – from social services to mental health – having the capacity to intervene early. If we retrench in isolation, the risks to public safety can only increase.’ He warned that police could lose council-funded CCTV cameras because local authorities face further tough spending cuts. Police chiefs have warned that the scale of the cuts to come could see neighbourhood policing decimated and patrols axed . ‘We have to have a shared view of the risks to public safety, from countering terrorism to child protection,’ he said. ‘We need to be transparent about these risks with the public, politicians and the media, so we can together make informed choices about our priorities. 'Our partners face their own cost pressures, and the big concern is that if we don’t work together, with a shared view of the risks, public safety will suffer.’ Officer numbers in London have been kept at 32,000 so far, but levels will have to drop as the Yard loses a third of its budget by 2020. Of the £800million in new cuts, the most optimistic private assessment is the Met can save £400million, leaving it to find another £400million by 2020.","UK's most senior officer says new budget cuts require 'radical action'

"Taxi company Uber's low-cost carpooling service, UberPOP, is set to be banned in France from January next year, the government said. The ruling comes after hundreds of taxi drivers blocked roads around Paris to protest what they claim are its unfair business practices. Drivers blocked the roads heading from the Roissy Charles de Gaulle airport, then inched toward the French capital in their latest protest of the ride-sharing company. Un appy: Uber's low-cost carpooling service, UberPOP, will be banned in France from January 1 . The new law tightening regulations for chauffeured rides will effectively ban the UberPOP service as of January 1st, Pierre-Henry Brandet, spokesman for France's Interior Ministry, said. 'Currently, people who use UberPop are not protected if there is an accident. So not only is it illegal to offer this service but for the consumer there is a real danger,' Brandet told the BFM television network. France is the latest of several places where Uber has faced challenges to its service, which matches people seeking rides with drivers through a cellphone app. Traditional taxis say Uber has an unfair advantage because its drivers don't face the same requirements, insurance and taxes. On Friday, a French court stopped short of banning the company but ordered Uber to make changes, including omitting 'all mention suggesting it is legal' for its drivers to act like taxis — that is, driving around and waiting for clients. French motorcycle police escort striking Paris taxis which take part in a demonstration over the Paris ring road heading into the capital from the Roissy Charles de Gaulle airport . Parisian taxi drivers are fed up with what they see as unfair competition from Uber's UberPOP, which uses non-professional drivers using their own cars to take on passengers at budget rate . New rules: A French court stopped short of banning the company but ordered Uber to make changes . This comes after Uber services were banned in Spain, Holland and the Indian capital New Delhi just last week. UberPOP is a peer-to-peer carpooling service offered through the Uber app. Unlike the normal UberX, which is a taxi with a professional licensed driver, anyone can register their car to UberPOP. The service cuts the normal taxi fare with around 50 per cent. A Madrid judge ordered Spanish phone companies to block the Uber app while the court examines a case brought by the Madrid Taxi Association last Tuesday. The court ruled that Uber drivers in Madrid carry out activities that 'constitutes unfair competition', the services said in a statement. They also accused drivers hired through the app of  'lacking the administrative authorisation to carry out the job.' The ruling was a 'cautionary measure' adopted while the court examines a case brought by the Madrid Taxi Association, the service said in a statement. Last Monday, Dutch judges banned UberPOP, from taking bookings via its smartphone app and threatened the company with fines of up to 100,000 euros ($123,000), saying unlicensed drivers were breaking the law. Bad times:  Uber's services have been banned from Spain, Holland, France and New Delhi in just one week . A defiant Uber reacted in a statement by saying it 'will continue to offer UberPOP.' Also on Monday, the city government in New Delhi  banned Uber from operating in the Indian capital after a passenger accused one of its drivers of rape. Shiv Kumar Yadav, 32, is expected to be charged with raping the finance company employee on Friday night. He was hired to ferry her home from a dinner engagement. New Delhi Police said they were considering legal action against Uber for failing to run background checks after it emerged the suspect was arrested for raping a woman three years ago but was later acquitted. Authorities in Denmark and Norway have also filed complaints against Uber. In Germany, a court in Frankfurt threw out an injunction against Uber in September. Uber was able to resume operating legally in Germany pending a final ruling on a complaint by the taxi federation.","Uber's UberPOP service is banned in France from next year .

"A Utah father will serve 30 days in jail and 30 days of house arrest for chaining his 7-year-old son to a bed while he was at work. State Judge Brandon Maynard insisted on jail time Monday despite a recommendation from prosecutors that 29-year-old Sammie Hodges from Logan only serve house arrest. Utah father Sammie Hodges, 29, chained his 7-year-old son to a bed while he was at work because he couldn't afford daycare . The judge said he didn't want to keep father and son apart, though. 'My goal is not to undermine reunification efforts with your son, but rather to reinforce making good parenting decisions,' Maynard said. Hodges was charged in June with four counts of child abuse and pleaded guilty to one count in November as part of a deal with prosecutors. His son wasn't injured by a heavy chain padlocked to his ankle in June and had access to snacks, water and a bathroom, police said. Police acting on a tip found the boy in a middle-class neighborhood in Logan, a city of about 49,000 people 80 miles north of Salt Lake City. Defense attorney David Perry said Hodges chained the boy to keep him from running around the neighborhood because he couldn't afford day care. Prosecutor Jacob Gordon said his actions absolutely rose to the level of child abuse, according to The Herald Journal. 'This is an inappropriate way of child care; there is no way around it,' Gordon said. The unnamed boy is in foster care. Hodges was also sentenced to 80 hours of community service, and will have to take anger management and parenting classes. He will be released to go to work during his jail sentence. Hodges was ordered to report to jail on December 26 after spending the holiday with his son.","Sammie Hodges, 29, will serve jail time and community services after his son was found padlocked by his ankle to a bed in June ."

"Desperate: Shaker Aamer, who can only speak to his family via Skype from Guantanamo Bay . For a few agonising moments, the iPad screen was blank. Then, at last, it flickered to life, to be filled by a familiar round face with a white-flecked beard and deeply-etched lines. Though the man forced one of his big, trademark smiles, fear and misery were seared in his eyes; though he tried to sound optimistic. Gathered around the screen, his family bolstered his spirits with uplifting stories about their lives – how his children were faring well at school and growing up to make him proud; yet they, too, struggled to mask their sorrow. Relayed 4,600 miles from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to Battersea, South London via Skype, this was Detainee 239 Shaker Aamer’s first call to his wife, Zin, and four children (aged between 17 and 13), for two and a half years. Since 2012, the US authorities had forbidden the last British resident being held in the detention camp from communicating with his family, and his only contact with the world beyond his grim cell had come via occasional meetings with lawyers. Perplexingly, however, Mr Aamer – who has been held without trial for 13 years since being captured in Afghanistan and handed to American forces fighting the Taliban – has been permitted to make two Skype calls to them in the past month. The most recent lasted an hour and came last Thursday: the day the Daily Mail began campaigning for his release on the grounds that to imprison anyone – even if they turn out to be a very bad man – indefinitely without testing their guilt or innocence before a court of law violates the most fundamental principle of western justice. The emotion-charged call, facilitated by the International Red Cross (who provided the iPad), was described yesterday by Mr Aamer’s father-in-law, Saeed Siddique, 72, who remained in the room for the first 15 minutes, before withdrawing so that his daughter and grandchildren could speak to him privately. Scroll down for video . Mr Siddique, a softly-spoken retired imam, told me: ‘One of the first things that Shaker wanted to know was whether anyone outside our family cared about him or whether he had just been quietly forgotten. ‘We didn’t know then that the Daily Mail had decided to fight his cause, so we had to be truthful and tell him that no one was writing about his case. He looked very disappointed but when we are able to tell him about your campaign the next time we speak, it will give him new heart. Father of four: Mr Aamer, pictured with two of his children, has been permitted to make two Skype calls to them in the past month . ‘We have no idea why they are allowing Shaker to call us now, after such a long and very painful silence. It might be a sign that something is about to happen, but we have been disappointed so many times that we daren’t raise our hopes.’ Mr Siddique recalls that his son-in-law has been held in Guantanamo since 2002. His family expected him to be released in February 2009 – coming home on the same London-bound plane as Binyamin Mohammed, another British resident who had been detained in the US camp. The family decked the house with balloons and ‘Welcome Home’ bunting. But it had to be taken down when Aamer was not released. Mr Siddique suspects that the reason, despite having been cleared for release by the Americans, was because it was feared he would reveal bombshell secrets about his years in detention that would be highly damaging to the Labour government. Stressing that he thinks it is a party political issue, he says: ‘The Tories and David Cameron seem genuinely interested in bringing him home, but Labour did absolutely nothing – just promises and going to pointless meetings. Family: Mr Aamer’s father-in-law, Saeed Siddique, 72, said the detainee had wanted to know 'whether anyone outside our family cared about him' ‘I think they wanted to leave him there because MI6 had warned them what would happen if he came back.’ Mr Aamer’s London lawyer, Irene Nembhard, concurs. In fact, she goes further, suggesting that the reason the Americans haven’t released him – despite freeing 18 other detainees in recent weeks – might be because they are relying on flawed ‘intelligence’, provided many years ago by the British security services, warning them that it wouldn’t be safe to send him back to Britain. Whatever the truth, his family say he would welcome the opportunity to stand trial in a British court, or indeed any court, to prove his innocence. For their part, the American authorities contend that he left London for Kabul shortly before the 9/11 attacks to join Al Qaeda and that he served as Osama bin Laden’s personal interpreter. However, Mr Aamer denies this. He maintains – suspicious as it undeniably sounds – that he went to live in Afghanistan to experience life in an Islamic country and to do charity work, having been presented with obstacles when he applied to move his family to his native Saudi Arabia, to be near his parents. When the War on Terror broke out, he says, he attempted to return to Britain but was captured by the keepers of a guesthouse where he was lodging and sold to the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance, who, in turn, sold him to the Americans for a $5,000 bounty. ‘Why would he have applied to live in Saudi, if he had wanted to fight with the Taliban or Al Qaeda?’ asks his father-in-law Siddique incredulously, as the country’s government broke links with the terror organisations many years ago. ‘He approached the Saudi embassy in London and had two or three meetings with them. ‘He would welcome the chance to tell all this to a British court. If there’s anything against him, let them put him before a judge and jury.’ Mr Siddique added that – as the family patriarch – he would personally vouch for his son-in-law’s good behaviour, were he to be returned to Britain. What’s more, he is convinced that his son-in-law would not – if released or cleared – follow the example of several of the other British former detainees who obtained huge compensation after suing the Government. Cause: Mr Aamer  maintains – suspicious as it undeniably sounds – that he went to live in Afghanistan to experience life in an Islamic country and to do charity work . The day before last Thursday’s Skype call, Mr Aamer met his human rights lawyer, Clive Stafford Smith, at Guantanamo. Until Washington declassifies records of their encounter, he is not permitted to reveal what passed between them. However, the lawyer says that Detainee 239 ‘boomed with laughter’ when he told him about the Senate Committee’s torture report, and the CIA’s self-justifying response to it. The reason for his ironic mirth was clear. Though his name doesn’t appear in the shameful report, when Mr Stafford Smith asked him, some time ago, to catalogue his torture, he replied that it would be quite impossible – because he had endured it, albeit in a sometimes subtle form, on every one of the 4,600-odd days he has been in custody. ‘If he were to write it all down, it would be ten times as long as the abridged report released by the Senate,’ Mr Stafford Smith says. It is a sobering thought. Sobering, too, to learn that while incarcerated, Shaker Aamer’s father, a brother and a sister have died. His mother is ‘critically ill’, according to Mr Siddique, who says she might not live long. She is blind and will never see her son again – but it would come as some comfort to know that her son might, one day soon, be freed and not have to depend on Skype to be in contact with his wife and children.","Shaker Aamer has been held in Guantanamo Bay without trial for 13 years .

"Recep Tayyip Erdogan is taking on supporters of the cleric Fethullah Gulen, a former ally . Turkey's president Recep Tayyip Erdogan has dismissed international criticism of raids on media organizations in the country, telling the EU 'keep your opinions to yourselves.' The 28-member bloc has criticized yesterday's police raids, which targeted a newspaper and a television station affiliated with the US-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen - a one-time ally of President Erdogan who has turned into one of his biggest critics. More than two dozen people, including a chief editor, journalists, television producers and scriptwriters, were detained in Sunday's raids, that included the Istanbul headquarters of Zaman newspaper and Samanyolu TV. They were targeted on suspicion of 'using intimidation and threats' to try to take control of the state. The EU said Sunday's raids were incompatible with media freedoms and suggested they could affect Turkey's longstanding  bid to become part of the union. But In a speech in northwest Turkey today, Erdogan called the arrests a domestic security issue and said he didn't care if the raids affect the country's EU membership bid. 'The issue is not one of media freedoms,' Erdogan said. 'Those who threaten our national security - and it doesn't matter if they are members of the press - will get the response they deserve. 'Whether the EU takes us in or not, we have no such worry. You keep your opinions to yourselves,' Some of the suspects were released after questioning today.

Staff and supporters of Zaman newspaper shout slogans as editor-in-chief Ekrem Dumanli, centre, is arrested by counter-terror police at the newspaper headquarters in Istanbul today . Erdogan has accused Gulen's followers within the police and judiciary of being behind corruption allegations that rattled his government last year and has vowed to go after them. Pro-Erdogan newspapers said those detained were being questioned over allegations they were involved in 2009 in making false accusations and fabricating evidence that a rival Islamic group had links to al-Qaida . The episode led to a police crackdown on the rival group, but the Gulen movement rejects the allegation. Erdogan has been in open conflict with Gulen since a graft investigation targeting Mr Erdogan's inner circle emerged a year ago. 'The free press cannot be silenced,' a crowd chanted outside Zaman's offices as its editor Ekrem Dumanli made a speech defiantly challenging police to detain him - as Hidayet Karaca, the chairman of Samanyolu TV, was arrested in Istanbul. Just before his arrest, Mr Karaca told reporters: 'This is a shameful sight for Turkey. 'Sadly in 21st century Turkey, this is the treatment they dish out to a media group with tens of television and radio stations, internet media and magazines.' Arrest warrants had reportedly been issued for 32 people. A man holds a placard that reads 'a time for democracy' as people gather in support outside Zaman newspaper in Istanbul, Turkey .

As well as Mr Karaca, a television producer, a director and scriptwriters were held. Mr Erdogan introduced many democratic reforms in his first years in power and curbed army involvement in politics after his AK Party was elected in 2002. NATO allies often cited Turkey, a candidate for the EU, as an example of a successful Muslim democracy. But more recently critics have accused the President of intolerance of dissent and, increasingly, a divisive reversion to Islamist roots. English-language Today's Zaman editor Bulent Kenes told Reuters police had shown them documentation which referred to a charge of 'forming a gang to try and seize state sovereignty'. Zaman editor-in-chief Ekrem Dumanli is escorted by plainclothes police officers and cheered on by his colleagues as he leaves Zaman's headquarters . Mr Dumanli kisses a Turkish flag as supporters of the Fethullah Gulen movement surround him . Crowds chanted 'The free press cannot be silenced,' outside Zaman's offices as its editor Ekrem Dumanli, right, was detained . Government ministers declined to make specific comments on the raids, but Health Minister Mehmet Muezzinoglu, according to state media, said: 'Anyone who does wrong pays the price'. Main opposition CHP leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu said: 'This is a coup government. A coup is being carried out against democracy'. Mr Erdogan has accused Mr Gulen of establishing a 'parallel structure' within the state through his supporters in the judiciary, police and other state institutions, as well as wielding influence through the media. The cleric denies the accusation of seeking to overthrow Mr Erdogan's government. Mr Erdogan drew on Mr Gulen's influence on the police and judiciary in the first years of his government in taming an army that had toppled four administrations since 1960, including Turkey's first Islamist-led cabinet. That relationship has dramatically soured. Turkish police launched a sweeping operation to arrest supporters of President Tayyip Erdogan's rival, US-exiled imam Fethullah Gulen . Mr Dumanli, left,  made a speech defiantly challenging police to detain him, and right, film director Engin Koc was also arrested . Plain-clothed Turkish policemen arrest TV producer Salih Asan as part of an operation to simultaneously detain broadcasters and journalists . Mr Gulen denies the accusation of seeking to overthrow Mr Erdogan's government. Pictured, TV producer Salih Asan is arrested . Mr Erdogan, who consolidated his power further in moving from the prime minister's office to the presidency in August, said on Friday he would pursue Mr Gulen's supporters into their 'lairs'. He has described them in the past as terrorists and traitors. The graft investigation, which became public with police raids on December 17 last year, led to the resignation of three ministers and prompted Mr Erdogan to purge the state apparatus. He reassigned thousands of police and hundreds of judges and prosecutors and has also pushed through legislation increasing government control of the judiciary - most recently a law restructuring two top courts. Meanwhile, prosecutors have dropped the corruption cases. Today's police raids had been expected for several days after a widely-followed Twitter account, which has previously given advance warning of police operations, said police were set to detain around 400 people, including around 150 journalists regarded as Mr Gulen supporters.

"A new scheme will see 100,000 houses built on so-called 'brownfield' land and reserved for sale only to young people buying their first homes . First-time buyers under the age of 40 will be offered 20 per cent discounts on 100,000 new homes under a new scheme starting next month. David Cameron will today announce that the 'Starter Home' initiative will be fast-tracked so potential buyers can register as early as January. Under the scheme, 100,000 houses will be built on so-called 'brownfield' land and reserved for sale only to young people buying their first homes. The scheme was first proposed at Tory conference but not expected to begin until after the General Election. It has now been brought forward six months. It is an extension of the party's flagship Help to Buy scheme, which aims to get people on the housing ladder. The discount for a £200,000 home would be a huge £40,000. Housebuilders would be exempted from some taxes and property regulations, making it easier to release brownfield sites - land formerly used for industrial or commercial purposes - to build these homes on. The savings would then be passed on to first time buyers. Mr Cameron said: 'Hardworking young people want to plan for the future and enjoy the security of being able to own their own home. I want to help them do just that. 'Under this scheme, first-time buyers will be offered the chance of a 20per cent discount, unlocking home ownership for a generation. 'This is all part of our long-term economic plan to secure a better future for Britain, making sure we are backing those who work hard and get on in life.' A consultation document will be launched today outlining the details of the scheme, which is designed to help more young people who are priced out of the housing market buy their first property. From next month they will be able to provide their details on a new website, putting them on a list for new homes built under the scheme. Officials said councils and builders are already looking at sites where the scheme could operate and work on the first tranche of homes will start next year. Property taxes and requirements imposed by councils mean house builders pay an average of £15,000 extra per home – potentially adding tens of thousands to the cost of each site. By exempting them in specific cases from such regulations, the money will be freed up to be passed on to new buyers. The homes could then not be re-sold at market value for a fixed period. More than 30 house builders have indicated their support for the plans as have nine local authorities. Mr Cameron will also announce a new design panel, including architects Sir Terry Farrell and Sir Quinlan Terry to come up with plans for the properties. Official said they would be lower cost and high quality attractive homes that 'meet the demands of modern life'. First-time buyers under the age of 40 will be offered 20 per cent discounts on 100,000 new homes under a new scheme starting next month . Stewart Baseley, executive chairman of the Home Builders Federation said: 'Increasing housing supply is a huge and complex challenge and significant barriers remain. Bringing forward more land for house building, while also enabling more first time buyers to realise their ambition of home ownership would be another positive step on the way to tackling the housing shortage. 'The industry is keen to work with government to develop policies that would allow for more high quality homes to be built in the right places.' Sir Terry Farrell, Founding Partner at Farrells, said: 'This panel has the potential to make a real difference. It builds on the recommendations of the Farrell Review, which highlighted the need for more proactive planning and better placemaking as we attempt to address the housing crisis, with radically higher priority given to landscape, sustainability and the public realm. 'Only by planning and designing our villages, towns and cities together with local communities can we create the kind of built environment we all aspire to and should be demanding.' First time buyers will be able to combine the 20 per cent discount on the price of the new home with a Help to Buy mortgage, meaning that both the house and the mortgage will be made more affordable.","Houses will be built on  'brownfield' land and reserved for young people .

"The world's oldest living African penguin has undergone $4500 worth of radiation treatment at Colorado State University's Veterinary Teaching Hospital in a bid to extend its life. Tess, who is 40 years old, was given a concentrated dose of radiotherapy last month to treat the skin cancer in the middle of her beak and right eye. With Tess now back home at Pueblo Zoo, zoo staff can keep their fingers crossed that she will reach 42 years old and become the world's oldest ever African penguin. African penguins will likely be completely obsolete in the wild over the next twenty years, CSU said in a release last week. If Tess's caretakers can raise awareness for the plight of the species through her, her treatment and hopefully the record, then it will be worth it. Scroll down for video . Getting up there: Tess, pictured, is 40 years old and the oldest African penguin in the world . Treatment: Concentrated radiation known as electronic brachytherapy was performed on Tess for just under 22 minutes as a non-invasive procedure, CSU said . 'Some people would ask, ""Why are you putting all of these resources into an individual animal?"" But, if this individual animal can tell a story that helps globally with the African penguin, then it’s all worth it,' said Dr. Matthew Johnston, a veterinarian at Colorado State Univeristy's James L. Voss Veterinary Teaching Hospital, said in a university release. 'If we can make people aware of these endangered species, with awareness comes action, and with action comes change. And, ultimately, we help,' Johnston also said. Tess's wounds were first spotted following a skirmish at Pueblo Zoo, which passed along tissue samples from an extracted mass to CSU, the university said. Pueblo Zoo veterinarian Dr. Kathy Wolyn said of Tess - an indoor penguin - in the release 'If you didn’t know her, you would never guess she’s as old as she is. That’s why we wanted to pursue further treatment for her tumor.' 'We would love to see Tess make it to be the oldest penguin on record, which would be 42,' Wolyn also said in a CSU video. 'But she's a special bird and we'd like to keep her around as long as possible, so even if we don't get a cure, at least we're buying her some good quality of life and a little bit longer life.' CSU said that Tess's mass showed up again and proved malignant. During her stay at the veterinary hospital, the elderly bird underwent a CT scan, which found that her face had a tumor 'about the size of a pinto bean.' Concentrated radiation known as electronic brachytherapy was performed on Tess for just under 22 minutes as a non-invasive procedure, CSU said. Homecoming: Tess, seen wearing a pink band on her wing, is now back in Pueblo Zoo's penguin exhibit and with her mate Mongo . Tess slept in the arms of her zookeeper during her trip back to Pueblo Zoo that night, and her tumor is now shedding, the university said . Dr. Johnston, speaking to MailOnline, said electronic brachytherapy was picked as Tess's treatment after her CT scan. 'Brachytheraphy is a really, really, good therapy for treating small superficial tumors,' he said, explaining that Tess's tumor 'fell into [that] treatment range.' Johnston said the area where the tumor was turned red and has started to slough off - but that veterinarians must wait four to six weeks to see if more radiation treatments are necessary. Pueblo Zoo paid $450 out of the $4500 total cost for Tess's treatment, and CSU covered the rest, Johnston told MailOnline. He explained, 'We don't have the opportunity to use this therapy very often, and we wanted to give it a shot.' Pueblo Zoo Executive Director Stephanie Stowell said in an email exchange with MailOnline that 'for our little zoo, this cutting edge treatment would normally be outside our reach, but the fine team at the vet teaching hospital agreed to do the work at a significantly reduced rate. 'They saw, as did we, that this was a tremendous opportunity to advance our knowledge of this treatment and it's impacts on non-traditional species. Any costs outside of the discounts and in-kind work that the CSU folks did, will be paid out of our veterinary operating budget for the year. Stoell said payment is still being worked out between the zoo and the university. Tess slept in the arms of her zookeeper during her trip back to Pueblo Zoo that night, and her tumor is now shedding, the university said. Tess spent two weeks in isolation before she re-entered Pueblo Zoo's penguin exhibit and got back into her nest with 33-year-old Mongo, her mate, CSU said. Pueblo Zoo penguin zookeeper Melanie Pococke said in the university's release 'I have always known that Tess is spectacular and extremely special. It was fun to see the excitement everyone had for her at the CSU vet hospital.I know she has an even larger fan base now. She is an extremely tough girl and will not go down without a fight.' 'She is the oldest African penguin in captivity currently,' Pococke said in CSU's video. 'She is a record-holder for a female. No female has ever made it to 40 before.'","Tess is the oldest African penguin in the world and received treatment from Colorado State University's Veterinary Teaching Hospital .

"Christmas diners seeking new ways to impress their guests have caused a spike in demand for over-sized bottles of wine and Champagne. Sales of magnums, which are twice as large as a standard 750ml bottle of wine, and methuselahs, which contain eight bottles, have risen over the festive period. Waitrose has reported sales of magnums have risen 122 per cent compared to the same period last year and now stocks 17 varieties. Scroll down for video . Getting busy with the fizzy: Supermarkets have reported a spike in the sale of large bottles of Champagne, such as magnums and methuselahs, with some costing more than £250 . Right, a Lanson White Label Methuselah, containing eight bottles, and a magnum (two bottles) of Prosecco available for £11.99 from Aldi . Sales of one magnum of red Bordeaux- a £35 bottle of Chateau Pey de la Tour - have risen by 230 per cent. Ken Mackay, Champagne buyer at Waitrose, said: 'We’ve seen a real increase in customers buying magnums in the run up to Christmas – whether bought as a gift or shared with party guests, they're a fun centrepiece and definitely add the wow factor to any festive gathering.' Waitrose also sells a Perrier-Jouet Belle Epoque Champagne magnum for £255. For those who prefer spirits, the supermarket also sells a magnum of Grey Goose Vodka for £120. Sainsbury's also reported more a spike in big bottle sales, such as a Moet & Chandon Champagne magnum costing £68. After high demand for Magnums of Prosecco, an Italian sparkling wine, last year, Tesco has introduced more large bottles, including methuselahs, which contain about 50 glasses. Magnum force: The sense of occasion that comes with the opening and pouring of an over-sized bottle of wine is one of the factors behind the spike in sales . The full range: A quarter bottle (or piccolo), a half bottle, a standard, a magnum, a Jeroboam, a Methuselah, a Salmanazar, a Balthazar and a Nebuchadnezzar . Laura Jewell, Tesco's master of wine, told the Times: 'Each methuselah requires two people to carry it and so there is a certain element of theatre created around the opening and pouring from the bottle.' Yesterday it was reported that supermarkets are slashing the cost of champagne this Christmas with bottles of bubbly are on offer for as little as £8. Many are touting quality wines and champagnes at half-price in an attempt to compete with budget retailers like Aldi and Lidl. Asda sparked the price war by cutting the price of Pierre Darcys champagne from £24.25 to just £10, giving customers almost a 60 per cent saving with an offer that runs until January 1. Tesco responded by knocking two-thirds off the official list price of award-winning Louis Delaunay champagne - from £25.99 to only £8, making it the cheapest on offer in Britain until the deal expired on December 2. Wine bottles range from piccolos, which contain a quarter of a regular bottle, to a melchizedek, which contain a volume of wine equivalent to 40 bottles.","Waitrose has reported sales of magnums have risen 122 per cent .

"A man has been jailed after faking his own kidnap in order to swindle more than £1,000 in ransom money from his girlfriend. Scheming Mohammed Kahn, 33, of Burntwood, Staffordshire, even sent pictures from a mobile phone to his partner, Surrena Lilly, showing fake injuries he painted on his own body using make-up. A court heard further text messages were then sent to Ms Lilly demanding £1,200 for his release as he concocted his elaborate story in October last year. Wolverhampton Crown Court heard Mohammed Kahn faked his own kidnap to swindle money from his girlfriend Surrena Lilly - and even sent her pictures of fake injuries he painted on his body using make-up . But the Kahn was caught out after he asked for a further four-figure sum and his girlfriend contacted police. Officers then turned up at Kahn's home and uncovered his plot after finding him safe and well and discovering his mobile phone. The court heard the faked kidnapping took place over five days between October 8 and October 13 last year. Andrew Keogh, prosecuting, said the text messages included threats Kahn would be hurt and picture messages of fake injuries. Judge Nicholas Webb (pictured) said Kahn's unusual crime was 'mean, cynical and nasty' He added: 'The complainant was sceptical, but in the end on October 13 came to the conclusion that there was something in it.' Mr Keogh said Ms Lilly used £200 of her own money and borrowed £1,000 from a friend to pay. But Kahn continued his ploy, sending her another text message demanding a further £1,500 for his release. Mr Keogh added: 'The police attended the defendant's home and found him unharmed and in possession of the mobile phone. 'He was arrested and said he was forced to send the text messages from two men.' Neil Skinner, defending, said: 'This is an unusual offence. 'He did owe people money and there was a lot of pressure to pay those people back. 'What he did then was use his position in his relationship to obtain money in the way he accepts he did. 'Maybe he could have asked her for it.' The court heard the couple have since split up. On Friday Kahn was jailed for four months after pleading guilty to fraud at Wolverhampton Crown Court. Sentencing, Judge Nicholas Webb said: 'I regard this as a mean, cynical and nasty offence against an emotional victim. 'You are 33, you are aware she seems to have liked you and you know that and took advantage of that emotionally in a cynical way'","Mohammed Kahn, 33, faked his own kidnap to swindle money from partner .

Shortly afterwards hostages were seen with their hands pressed against the windows holding up the Shahada flag belonging to the extremist group Jabhat al-Nusra, which is fighting the Assad government in Syria. There are claims that the terrorists are also armed with a machete and may have explosives but this has not been confirmed by police. One of the hostage-takers has made contact with officers saying that he has 'devices all over the city' and 'wants to speak with the prime minister live on radio', according to Ray Hadley, from 2GB.

"This is the shocking moment a family's Washington beachfront house toppled into the ocean during a violent storm that has caused many more homeowners to fear for their properties. The white-and-red vacation home was captured on video sitting precariously on the edge of a grassy embankment after high winds, rain and rough seas eroded the coastline at North Cove. Seconds later, it started to topple forward, before plummeting over the edge and into the ocean with a loud crash. As it fell, its chimney snapped, landing in the stormy water several meters away.

Going over: The property starts to topple forward as its horrified owners capture the incident on a cellphone . Doomed: The white-and-red vacation house plummets over the edge of the emankment and into the sea . The property's owners, who filmed the footage last Friday, were heard shrieking as their holiday home plunged into the ocean, finally coming to a rest in a wrecked state on its side. Now, the family's neighbors are scrambling to save what they can from their own properties before they also give way to the ferocious waves at what is dubbed 'Washaway Beach'. But some are already too late - with several more vacation homes in the area having already crumbled into the sea over the past few days. None were insured, Fox 40 News reported . When the majority of the properties were purchased years ago, they were situated several blocks away from the sea. But as rain and winds have continued to hit the area, they have been put at risk. Shocking: The property's owners, who filmed the footage last Friday, were heard shrieking during the incident .

Above, another view of the fallen house . The storm that is currently striking the Pacific Northwest stems from the weather system that last week dumped nearly 10 inches of rain in California's Bay Area and three inches in Sacramento. The system, fueled by a stream of tropical moisture called the 'Pineapple Express', resulted in severe flooding, landslides and widespread power outages when it hit San Francisco. On Monday, the National Weather Service said the storm was 'expected to be one of the strongest storms in terms of wind and rain intensity' since incidents in October 2009 and January 2008.

Hurricane force wind warnings have been posted for waters along the coast of northwest Oregon and southwest Washington, according to Weather.com.

"A senior judge has condemned Parliament for scrapping sentencing powers which would have allowed him to extend a jail sentence for a dangerous convicted paedophile. Jason Leonard deliberately defied court orders banning him from accessing the internet - just weeks after being freed early from prison for child pornography offences. Judge Andrew Woolman said he wanted to jail the 33-year-old for longer than the remainder of his 33-month sentence, but that changes passed in Parliament in 2003 did not allow him to imprison him for a further stretch. Instead Leonard was given just eight months for breaching a Sexual Offences Prevention Order which will now run concurrently with his current 32 month stretch imposed in 2013. Judge Andrew Woolman (left) said he wanted to jail Jason Leonard (right) for longer than the remainder of his 33-month sentence, but that changes passed in Parliament in 2003 did not allow him to do so . He may not be released until the end of his licence in February 2016. The changes to consecutive sentencing were made in the Criminal Justice Act 2003, which advises judges   to avoid consecutive sentences where possible. At Burnley Crown Court, Lancashire, Judge Woolman told Leonard: 'This was a very, very deliberate breach of the SOPO and if I had the powers, I would undoubtedly have made this sentence consecutive to the current sentence. 'But Parliament for reasons best known to itself had abolished the right of judges to return a defendant to custody to serve the balance of a sentence and to impose a term to then be served. 'That is a sad loss of power to the judiciary and one which does not serve the public at all. The sentence today, sadly, is completely academic.' Judge Woolman added: 'There is no evidence at the moment that you have used your access to the internet to download indecent images of children, so I have no choice but to sentence you on what you say, that there isn't. You are clearly a dangerous sex offender. 'There is no question about that. I don't suppose that anything the court is going to do is likely to change your attitude.' Leonard was originally arrested in January 2012 after police had raided the he shared with his elderly mother in Haslingden and found a stash of 251 photographs of youngsters on his computer - five of which were of the most serious kind. Judge Andrew Woolman told Burnley Crown Court he wanted to jail the 33-year-old for longer than the remainder of his 33-month sentence, but that changes passed in Parliament in 2003 did not allow him to imprison him for a further stretch . Inquiries revealed Leonard had also been distributing the pornography on a file sharing website - allowing fellow perverts worldwide to look at the vile pictures. He originally intended to take his case to trial so he could air his 'distorted' views on sex to a jury. But in June 2013 he was jailed after admitting charges of distributing an indecent photograph of a child in January 2011, and allegations of making an indecent photograph of a child, between August 2011 and January last year. He was ordered to sign the sex offenders' register indefinitely, was banned from working with children for life, and was given an indefinite sexual offences prevention order. Under the order, he was not allowed to use any device capable of accessing the internet, unless it has the capacity to retain, and display, the history and he makes it available for inspection by police on request. He was also prohibited from deleting the history, from using any software that deletes it, and must not possess any device capable of storing digital images unless he makes it available for police inspection on request. Leonard was freed in October this year after serving just 14 months of his sentence. But last month police went to check on his welfare as he had been 'outed as a sex offender by a leaflet and poster campaign in the area, and found a laptop at his home. They then unearthed an external hard drive, fitted with encryption software, which he had hidden in a plastic bag and buried in a plant pot in the kitchen. The hard drive is being examined by police experts but it may take months or longer because of their workload. Stephen Parker, prosecuting, said Leonard had told police the laptop had no intent access and he had been playing games on it. He continued : 'It was apparent, on examination, it had been connected to the internet over the preceding days.' The defendant was arrested and questioned and said he bought the hard drive and encryption software before he was sentenced. Bernadette Baxter, defending Leonard, said he bought the hard drive to download mainstream movies and TV shows whilst he was awaiting sentence. She continued: 'He knows he should have disposed of it because of the sentence and he didn't do so. However, he is adamant that the device, when analysed, will not reveal any indecent images of children.' Miss Baxter said Leonard was mindful of the shame he had brought on his 77-year-old mother. She added: 'He has learned a salutary lesson by being brought back to custody and being brought back before the courts.'","Jason Leonard defied court orders banning him from accessing internet .

"Jonathan Burrows, who paid back £43,000 after admitting dodging rail fares, has been banned from working in the financial industry . A high-flying City executive who paid back nearly £43,000 after he was caught dodging rail fares has been banned from the financial industry. Jonathan Burrows, who reportedly earned £1 million a year, admitted his behaviour was 'foolish' saying the ban came after an unblemished 20-year career. Mr Burrows left his job as a managing director of BlackRock Asset Management Investor Services earlier this year after it emerged he dodged fares during his trip from the rural station of Stonegate, East Sussex to Cannon Street, central London. He was today banned by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) from performing any function in the industry it regulates 'for not being fit and proper' after the fare dodging, which was believed to have taken place over five years. Porsche-driving Burrows owns two huge, mortgage-free mansions in the East Sussex countryside – a £1million house near Wadhurst and his impressive home near the village of Stonegate, which he bought for £2.7million in 2011. He shares the Victorian property – which boasts acres of landscaped grounds, ponds and a tennis court – with his wife Louise and their young child in an isolated spot not far from Stonegate station . Tracey McDermott, FCA director of enforcement and financial crime, said: 'Burrows held a senior position within the financial services industry. His actions fell short of the standards we expect. 'Approved persons must act with honesty and integrity at all times and, where they do not, we will take action.' Mr Burrows was able to pay £42,550 for the dodged fares and £450 in legal costs within three days as part of an out-of-court settlement with rail firm Southeastern. The FCA said Mr Burrows admitted in an interview to evading his train fare on a number of occasions and had done so in the knowledge he had been breaking the law. He had also admitted that he did not disclose his behaviour to his employer. Mr Burrows said in a statement: 'I have always recognised that what I did was foolish. I have apologised to all concerned and reiterate that apology publicly today. 'The settlement I made with Southeastern in March 2014 was for an amount significantly in excess of the value of the fares not paid by me on the small number of occasions that I failed to pay. 'Indeed the size of the settlement could be said to have led to a distorted perception of the scale of my wrong-doing. However, that does not change the fact that what I did was wrong, and I accept that.' Mr Burrows insisted the money he paid back was 'significantly in excess' of what he had dodged . He added: 'In view of this, I have been told by the British Transport Police that they do not regard it as being in the public interest to pursue a case against me. 'While I respect the FCA's decision today, I also regret it, coming as it did after a 20-year career in the City that was without blemish. Mr Burrows carried out the ruse by boarding the London-bound train from Stonegate, a rural station with no barriers in East Sussex, without buying a ticket, before 'tapping out' using an Oyster card at Cannon Street. It meant he paid a £7.20 maximum Oyster fare rather than paying for a £21.50 train ticket for the one-hour 22-minute journey. He was eventually caught in November last year by a ticket inspector standing next to the barrier. 'I recognise that the FCA has on its plate more profound wrong-doing than mine in the financial services sector, and I am sorry that my case has taken up its time at this critical juncture for the future of the City and its reputation.' Burrows admitted having failed to use his Oyster card to tap in for five journeys between London Bridge – where he got off his train from East Sussex – and Cannon Street, which should have cost him just £2.30 a time. However, further inquiries revealed that until 2008 Burrows had been buying an annual season ticket from Stonegate, which has no ticket barriers, to Cannon Street, which costs around £4,500 a year for standard class. A standard daily single fare is £21.50. BlackRock said in a statement: 'Jonathan Burrows left BlackRock earlier this year. What he admitted to the FCA is totally contrary to our values and principles.' A spokesman for British Transport Police said: 'We conducted a full and thorough investigation following allegations that a rail traveller had repeatedly avoided paying the correct fare between Stonegate and central London. 'Following these inquiries detectives have concluded that, at this stage, it would not be appropriate to take further action.' Mr Burrow often travelled from the rural station of Stonegate, East Sussex into Cannon Street, London .","City executive paid back £43,000 after he was confronted by train firm .

"A woman who lost part of her left leg in the Boston Marathon bombing fears she will not be able to afford her prosthetic limbs after the charity set up to help victims announced it was winding down. Heather Abbott was caught in the explosion when two pressure bombs exploded near the finish line in April 2013, killing three and injuring more than 260. But while the 40-year-old said she was incredibly grateful to the One Fund Boston charity which has helped her afford four different prosthetic legs, she fears for the future after the charity announced it will stop its operations. Scroll down for video . Boston Marathon bombing survivor Heather Abbott fears she will not be able to afford prosthetic limbs after the One Fund Boston charity shut down its website and said it will stop taking donations after New Years Eve . The 40-year-old from Newport, Rhode Island, lost part of her left leg when two pressure bombs exploded near the finish line in April 2013. She currently has four prosthetic limbs, but she expects her health insurance to cover one new one, every three to five years . 'I can't thank the donors enough for all of their support and generosity,' she said, but the defence company worker added that she knows the costly appendages will require regular upkeep and replacement for the rest of her life. With the help of One Fund Boston helped she has been able to afford four different prosthetic legs - one for daily use, a waterproof one, a running leg and another for wearing high heels. But while people rarely notice her current range of prosthetic limbs, even if she's out in sandals, she expects her health insurance to cover one new leg, which can run from $20,000 to $100,000, every three to five years. It's also likely that it won't cover her specialized running, swimming or high heel legs. It also appears unlikely that it will pay for other costs such as adjusting the fit of the prosthesis as her stump atrophies and changes over time. Abbott, from who now works part-time, said she hopes she'll make up the difference by wisely investing the money she's been given, a plan that includes the construction of her own home in Newport, Rhode Island. Since its foundation shortly after the bombing, the charity has distributed nearly $80 million in donations to victims and their families. More than 200,000 individuals, corporations and charities in over 60 countries donated to the fund, according to its executive director Lori van Dam. This allowed them to give gave around $2.3 million to each of the families that lost a relative when the two pressure bombs exploded near the finish line in April 2013. The One Fund has distributed $80 million in donations to victims and their families. Any money remaining after paying the fund's administrative costs will go to the One Fund Center, which will provide care for brain injury victims and others with mental health issues . Abbott fears for other victims like Rebekah DiMartino who did not qualify for additional One Fund money because her amputation came so late. But she said she hopes she'll make up the difference by wisely investing the money she's been given . Those like Abbott who lost limbs or suffered other serious injuries received anywhere from $421,000 to $3.3 million, depending on the extent of their wounds. Others who were hospitalized but suffered less serious injuries received between $150,000 and about $1 million, while victims treated as outpatients and not hospitalized received between $12,500 and $20,500. Van Dam said any remaining money will go towards the fund's administrative costs and the One Fund Center. Launched in September, it will provide victims care for those with a traumatic brain injury, persistent hearing problems and mental health issues like post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety. It was jointly founded by the Massachusetts General Hospital and the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. However, Abbott fears for marathon survivors who have not received any money from the fund, but who may well need it in the future . 'I can only imagine how other amputees feel who don't have a One Fund,' she said. Among those victims is Texan Rebekah DiMartino, who finally had her left leg amputated last month after 17 operations to save it. Like some other amputees, she did not qualify for additional One Fund money because her amputation came so late. 'It's a little scary because being a recent amputee I was not entitled to the sums that they received,' she told the Associated Press, referring to other survivors who lost limbs in the attacks. Suspect: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, pictured, will face trial in January after being indicted with numerous charges in relation to the bombings. He has pleaded not guilty . 'However, I am more than grateful for what I did get and know that everything else will work out,' DiMartino added. While she expects her insurance will cover some of the costs for her prosthesis when it's ready, she said that she will have to pay the remainder out of her own pocket. Like Abbott she said she had not problem with the fund which was conceived by current Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick and then-Boston Mayor Thomas Menino in the days after the attack. 'When it comes to injuries sustained from a bombing, there's really no way to place a price or payout for a lifetime of treatment,' she said. 'The One Fund did as good of a job that they could have done with payouts with not knowing everyone's path for healing and progression.' The prime suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, will face trial in January after being indicted with numerous charges in relation to the bombings. He has pleaded not guilty, but faces the possibility of the death penalty if convicted. His older brother, Tamerlan, was killed in a shootout with police days after the two pressure cooker bombs killed three people and injured more than 260 others.

"A food supplier falsely marketed beef to Muslims around the world for years as meeting strict halal standards, exporting products that weren't slaughtered in accordance with Islamic law, federal prosecutors allege in a lengthy fraud indictment. Midamar Corp., based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, denies the allegations that it sold at least $4.9 million in beef to customers in Malaysia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates and elsewhere that did not follow the halal practices promised in its labeling and advertising. Midamar and its directors, brothers Jalel and Yahya 'Bill' Aossey, are charged with conspiring to make and use false statements and documents, sell misbranded meat and commit mail and wire fraud. Midamar Corp., based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, denies the allegations that it sold at least $4.9 million in beef to customers in Malaysia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates and elsewhere that did not follow the halal practices . Also indicted is another company the brothers operate, Islamic Services of America - one of the few organizations approved by Malaysia, Indonesia, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and UAE to certify beef for import into their countries. The defendants are charged with 91 other counts of making false statements on export certificates, wire fraud and money laundering. The brothers, ages 40 and 44, entered not guilty pleas to the charges and were released following an arraignment Monday at the federal courthouse in Cedar Rapids. Their father, Midamar founder William Aossey Jr., 73, pleaded not guilty to similar charges last week and watched Monday's hearing with a company banker. The defendants are charged with 91 other counts of making false statements on export certificates, wire fraud and money laundering . Attorney Michael Lahammer, who entered not guilty pleas on behalf of the corporations, said Midamar stands by its ""stellar record"" of delivering and exporting quality products for 40 years and would contest the charges. A multibillion industry for which millions of cows,sheeps, pigs, and calves, are slaughtered every year, Halal is an Arabic word meaning 'permissible' which establishes guidelines for how to properly kill an animal for Islamic consumption. For one, the animal must be healthy and a Muslim must perform the killing. The animal's throat must be cut by a sharp knife which will sever the carotid artery, the jugular vein, and the windpipe all in one cut. Blood must then be drained from the body. In some slaughterhouses the animals may be stunned before their throats are slit, though Muslim acceptance of this practice varies from sect to sect. In the last year, the practice has been the center of an a heated controversy over whether it is a humane way to slaughter animals. He said the company believed it had fixed labeling infractions uncovered by inspectors in 2010, and would challenge the allegations of halal fraud on the grounds that they violate the U.S. constitution's separation of church and state. 'The government has no right to regulate what is a religious matter,' he said. Midamar, which remains in business, said in a statement that its slaughter methods have been vetted by halal auditors for decades. 'The allegations of halal fraud are due to a `one size fits all' approach taken by the government authorities,' the company said. Islamic Services of America said that it won't allow 'allegations, implications or inferences of any improprieties' to affect its operations. The companies are based at the same location and collectively have about 80 employees. The indictment alleges the companies repeatedly gave the false impression that beef products complied with import and United States Department of Agriculture requirements. Midamar and Islamic Services of America told customers its cattle were slaughtered by hand by specially-trained Muslim slaughtermen who always recited prayer, the indictment alleges. Midamar also advertised that it did not use penetrative captive bolt stunning, a process commonly used in meatpacking in which an animal is killed when a steel rod is shot into its brain. Midamar, which remains in business, said in a statement that its slaughter methods have been vetted by halal auditors for decades . But Midamar's primary beef supplier was a Windom, Minnesota, meatpacking plant that used bolt stunning to ensure all cattle slaughtered 'were rendered senseless and were dead,' the indictment alleges. The plant, which wasn't certified for export to Indonesia and Malaysia, often did not have Muslim slaughtermen present and didn't recite the 'Tasmia' prayer, the indictment says. After the orders arrived in Cedar Rapids, employees removed federally-required labels showing the beef came from that plant with acetone or nail polish remover, the indictment says. Midamar also advertised that it did not use penetrative captive bolt stunning, a process commonly used in meatpacking in which an animal is killed when a steel rod is shot into its brain . Employees allegedly then put on fraudulent labels indicating the meat came from an Omaha plant that was certified to export to Malaysia and Indonesia. Midamar allegedly included the false representations about the source on export forms and certificates presented to and approved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Syed Rasheeduddin Ahmed, president of the Muslim Consumer Group for Food Products, said many Muslims are apprehensive about meat products that claim to meet halal standards. 'This indictment will add to their suspicion,' he said. 'Where can we buy? Which one is halal?'","Midamar Corp, of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, sold food to customers in Malaysia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates .

"America's race shootings have caused months of unrest across the country - and now an artist has imagined the Simpsons joining the protests in memory of the victims. In a series called 'I Can't Breathe', Italian artist AleXsandro Palombo has turned the usually yellow cartoon family black in memory of Eric Garner, Tamir Rice, Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown and all the other victims. In a series of shocking images, Chief Wiggum chases Bart waving a baton, then aims a gun at the ten-year-old, who is clearly holding a toy gun, at point-blank range. Bart is then pictured face down and apparently dead in front of a giant billboard showing the police chief with a smoking gun and the words: 'Cops Never Sleep'. Scroll down for video .

Stop racism: The police chief chases Bart with a baton, left, and right, a black Homer and Marge demand justice for the death of their son . The pictures eerily reflect the death of Tamar Rice last month, a 12-year-old who was playing with a pellet gun last month. He was shot by a Cleveland police officer at a park on November 22 and died the following day. Mr Palombo also echoes the death of Eric Garner - with Chief Wiggum depicted holding a black character in a chokehold and then appears on the news alongside presenter Kent Brockman discussing the incident. Mr Garner died in Staten Island, New York, when officer Daniel Pantaleo put him in an apparent chokehold, despite reports he had said: 'I can't breathe' - words which have now become a prominent feature in protests. Mr Palombo told MailOnline: 'With this art series I wanted to denounce the current social situation, the unbelievable racial facts of recent times. 'The images from the suffocation of Eric Garner are horrible, uncivilized. This is a crazy and an unacceptable violence.' He added: 'We are experiencing a dangerous social regression and if America does not react to the rampant racism it will no longer be the country of freedom and dreams, but the country of oppression and injustice.'

The family also pose in front of the Statue of Liberty, whose face is covered with a Ku Klux Klan hood, with their mouths covered. Mr Palombo is well-known for his satirical artwork to promote causes he believes. Last month, he depicted demale cartoon characters as victims of domestic violence to mark the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women and also re-imagined Disney princesses as breast cancer survivors to promote awareness of the disease.

"The C.I.A. tortured al-Qaeda suspects in the wake of 9/11 in a  bid to prove Saddam Hussein was behind the atrocity so they could justify the 2003 invasion of Iraq, it has been revealed. The agency came under immense pressure from George W. Bush's administration to forge a link between the former Iraqi dictator and al-Qaeda as it sought to bolster its argument for war. But an official 2009 report on detainee abuse - revealed by The Independent - claimed that the increasingly brutal methods of interrogations used to extract confessions yielded no hard evidence to back the theory. Brutal: The C.I.A. tortured al-Qaeda suspects in the wake of 9/11 in a bid to prove Saddam Hussein was behind the atrocity and therefore justify the 2003 invasion of Iraq, it has been revealed (pictured: a terror suspect is carried back to his cell following interrogation at Guantanamo Bay) Excuse for war: The agency came under immense pressure from the administration of then-President George W. Bush (left) to forge a link between Saddam Hussein (right) and al-Qaeda as it sought to bolster its argument for war . The claim came in a dossier compiled by the Senate Armed Services Committee, which quoted former US Army psychiatrist, Major Charles Burney, stationed at Guantanamo Bay as saying interrogators were told to focus on a single line of inquiry. 'A large part of the time we were focused on trying to establish a link between al-Qaeda and Iraq,' he said. 'There was more and more pressure to resort to measures that might produce more immediate results'. A source  told the McClatchy news agency that there were two reasons for wanting to prove Hussein's involvement: . First, senior White House officials wanted to prevent a second attack and, second, 'for most of 2002 and into 2003, [Vice-President Dick] Cheney and [Defence Secretary Donald] Rumsfeld were also demanding proof of the links between al-Qaeda and Iraq.' Back from the torture chamber: It follows a US Senate report which cast light on the range of 'brutal' interrogation techniques meted out on terror suspects in the years following the destruction of the Twin Towers . Torture: Waterboarding was deemed acceptable because it didn't cause the lengthy mental anguish needed to meet the legal standard of torture . But when told by the C.I.A. that the programme was producing no concrete results, Cheney and Rumsfeld pushed for tougher questioning. The source added: 'There was constant pressure on the intelligence agencies and the interrogators to do whatever it took to get that information out of the detainees, and when people kept coming up empty, they were told by Cheney's and Rumsfeld's people to push harder.' The CIA has defended its conduct by claiming that the relationship between torture and results was 'unknowable,' a claim rejected by the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Dianne Feinstein, who maintained that torture produced nothing of value. It follows a US Senate report which cast light on the range of 'brutal' interrogation techniques meted out on terror suspects in the years following the destruction of the Twin Towers. 'Push harder': A source said that 'for most of 2002 and into 2003, [Vice-President Dick] Cheney (far right) and [Defence Secretary Donald] Rumsfeld (far left) were also demanding proof of the links between al-Qaeda and Iraq' and demanded interrogators 'push harder' when no evidence was found . In one of several memos forming the legal underpinnings for brutal interrogation techniques, the CIA was told detainee Abu Zubaydah could lawfully be placed in a box with an insect, kept awake for days at a time and slapped multiple times in the face. Waterboarding, too, was acceptable because it didn't cause the lengthy mental anguish needed to meet the legal standard of torture, the 2002 Justice Department memo says. The release last week of a Senate report cataloging years of such interrogation tactics has revived debate about legal opinions since discredited and withdrawn and about the decision to not prosecute the program's architects or officers who used the methods. Civil rights groups in the United States and abroad are renewing calls to prosecute those who relied on techniques that President Barack Obama has called torture. 'How can we seriously use the phrase 'rule of law' if crimes of this magnitude go uninvestigated and unprosecuted?' said Jameel Jaffer, deputy legal director at the American Civil Liberties Union. The Justice Department, which spent years looking into the matter, says it lacks sufficient evidence to convict anyone and found no new information in the report. It also is far from clear that any international case could be brought.","Maj. Charles Burney made claim to Senate Armed Services Committee .

"It's a dog’s life for the nation’s mutts – who are becoming anxious and aggressive through lack of play, experts fear. A study of 4,000 dog owners has found a clear link between limited playtime and behaviour problems, such as being nervous when left alone, disobedience and snapping at other animals. And while researchers can’t be sure that playing less is directly to blame, they say that games provide vital intellectual stimulation and exercise. Scroll down for video . I want to go and play! Behavioural problems in dogs could be linked to a lack of play, said a study (file photo) The Bristol University study showed that only one in five owners play with their dogs six times a day. Half play two or three times a day and 10 per cent have just one play session. Mark Evans, former chief vet for the RSPCA, said that dogs are one of the few animals to play into adulthood. He told the Sunday Times: ‘There is a clear association in the results. Owners report more potential behaviour problems in dogs that play less.’ Emily Blackwell – who conducted the research unveiled tonight on Channel 4’s Dogs: Their Secret Lives – said dogs often enjoy playing so much that they slow down or change strategy to make the fun last longer. The lecturer in canine welfare hopes that 10,000 people will eventually fill out the survey. This will enable her to firmly establish whether lack of play is affecting dogs’ moods – or if their emotional problems put their owners off spending time with them. Walkies: It's not just exercise that helps our pets - games including 'chase' and 'fetch' are important too . For instance, they may slow down when playing ‘chase’, allowing their owner to catch up with them and the game to continue. Favourite games include wrestling, chase and tugging at toys, and perhaps unsurprisingly, ‘fetch’ topped the list. Tennis balls were the favourite toys, followed by soft, squeaky toys, rubber balls and rope toys. The research comes just days after an animal charity warned that millions of dogs are becoming fat, aggressive and destructive because their owners are clueless about basic animal care. The PDSA said that treats including beer, chips and leftover takeaways are making dogs fat and unwell – and warned that almost a million are never taken for a walk.","Bristol University study questioned 4,000 pet owners on their habits .

"A Mississippi pastor is protesting the possibility of legal marriage equality in his state by dressing his horse in a wedding dress outside a federal courthouse. Reverend Edward James of Bertha Chapel Missionary Baptist Church dressed his horse in the dress to protest same-sex marriage. 'The horse is to show the ridiculous idea of two men getting married,' Rev. Edward James said about his one-man demonstration to WJTV. Scroll down for video... Making his point: Reverend Edward James of Bertha Chapel Missionary Baptist Church in South Carolina protested marriage equality by dressing a horse in a wedding dress . The Rev. Edward James stood alongside the horse around noon Friday outside the Federal Courthouse in Jackson. He held up a sign that said, 'Marriage is one man and one woman. Anything else is a perversion.' James held one sign stating in part, 'Do you take this horse to be your unnatural wedded spouse to have and to hold?' Another sign read, 'Marriage is one man and one woman… anything else is a perversion.' 'I'm a Mississippian and I'm praying and hoping that we will remain a state that only recognizes marriage between a man and a woman,' says James. The pastor stood outside for more than two hours as people honked their horns or stopped to take pictures. As Charlotte grazed on an area of grass passersby stopped in the middle of the road to grasp what exactly was happening. One passing driver yelled, 'Your horse is pretty!' Why the long face? Conservatives often criticize legalizing same-sex marriages by comparing it to bestiality . Conservatives often criticize legalizing same-sex marriages by comparing it to bestiality. U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves struck down the state ban on marriage equality last month, but stayed his ruling to allow state officials time to bring an appeal. James acknowledged the 'ridiculous' nature of his display in an interview with the Jackson Clarion Ledger. 'I'm hoping that Judge Reeves will reconsider his ruling and that Mississippi will stay a state that will only recognize marriage between a man and a woman,' James said. 'The argument is not about sin or religious belief or what the church says about marriage equality,' local LGBT activist Eddie Outlaw told WJTV. 'It is strictly about benefits, rights, protection extended by government not by the church.' 'I thought it was laughable and I believe he was going for a ridiculous protest and he certainly got one'' The pastor stood outside for more than two hours as people honked their horns or stopped to take pictures . Growing population: Mississippi is home to an estimated 3,484 same-sex couples, according to the most recent decennial census. About one quarter of the couples are raising children . 'I think the good reverend should probably focus on what he can do to minister to the needs of the LGBT community and not get involved with hot button interests like marriage equality right now,' said Mr Outlaw. Gay couples cannot yet marry in Mississippi. The federal court of appeals will hear arguments about the ban on same sex-marriage on January 9th in New Orleans. The appeal will be heard along with gay marriage cases from Texas and Louisiana. A panel of judges will decide if same-sex marriage will be legal in all three states. Gay marriage is legal in 35 U.S. states, a trend that has accelerated since the Supreme Court ruled in June 2013 that legally married same-sex couples nationwide are eligible for federal benefits, striking down a key part of the 1996 federal Defense of Marriage Act. While gay marriage advocates have enjoyed the upper hand in the courts since then, the Cincinnati-based 6th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in November became the first to rule the other way in upholding state bans on same-sex marriage. That decision was seen as setting the stage for the Supreme Court to finally rule on the merits of gay marriage nationwide. Mississippi is home to an estimated 3,484 same-sex couples, according to the most recent decennial census. About one quarter of the couples are raising children.

"A cup of Kopi Luwak coffee is considered the height of luxury and can cost as much as £60, however the price in animal welfare has left a bitter taste. Now Selfridges has decided to remove the exclusive and highly prize coffee from shelves following concerns about the impact on the civet cats that are crucial to its production. Selfridges had sold the product, sourced from a small supplier, until October 2013. Bizarrely, the coffee, which is said to have a uniquely smooth taste, is harvested from the excrement of the civet cat. 'Luxury': The £60 cup of coffee, no longer sold in Selfridges, is made from the excrement of civet cats (right) Historically, plantation workers in the forests of Indonesia discovered that the civet cats in the wild would only eat the finest coffee beans. They collected the part digested beans excreted by the animals and made coffee that had a unique flavour. It was believed that the quality of the beans, coupled with the effects of the part digestion in the animal’s body were needed to develop the taste. As the coffee became known around the world, so a market developed with the result that farmers captured and caged the wild cats to ensure a plentiful and ready supply. However, animal welfare campaigners found the conditions in the tiny battery farm style cages are often cruel, filthy and inhumane. Indonesian farmers found the cats harvested high-quality beans as they only feed off high-quality ingredients . Undercover video footage by welfare campaigners found the tiny civets exhibiting neurotic behaviour such as incessant pacing, spinning and head-bobbing – indications that the wild-caught animals are going insane from boredom. One farmer explained civets are generally kept caged for around three years. Another compared civets eating too many coffee berries to humans smoking, as their health deteriorates during captivity because of a lack of vitamins and nutrition. The World Society for the Protection of Animals (WSPA) has campaigned to highlight the suffering with the result that Selfridges has decided to remove the coffee from sale. 'Dangerous': Animal rights campaigners claim the discovery ahs led to civets being kept in battery farm-style cages . The move follows an earlier decision by Harrods to stop selling coffee produced from caged civets. However, a number of UK websites are currently selling the controversial coffee for between £180 and £300 a kilo. The WSPA has launched a campaign for an independent certification scheme to ensure the coffee only comes from civet cats that are not held in cages. It has contacted a series of retailers in the UK and around the world asking what steps they are taking to verify whether their coffee is from farmed or wild civets. The animal charity has met with the Rain Forest Alliance and UTZ Certified, two organisations working across the world to certify that food products such as coffee meet responsible animal welfare standards. Dr Neil D’Cruze, the head of wildlife research  at WSPA, said: ‘Retailers all over the world have committed to only obtain civet coffee from guaranteed ‘cage- free’ sources and it is clear that this is the animal friendly product that consumers want. ‘We are encouraged by the dialogue we have had with these leading international certification bodies which we hope will result in retailers and consumers being able to make an informed and humane choice, preventing the cruel capture and confinement of hundreds of civets.’ Despite the controversy surrounding its production, the civet cat coffee still retains an air of luxury and mystery. It recently featured in the Hollywood move, The Bucket List, where Jack Nicholson’s terminally ill character chose it as one of the experiences he must try before he dies. A spokesman for Selfridges said the company previously sold civet coffee from a small sustainable supplier, however it has now decided to permanently remove it from shelves. There is no evidence that the coffee it was selling came from mistreated animals.","Kopi Luwak coffee, £60 a cup, is made from excrement of civet cats .

"A 1,000-pound cow jumped a 6-foot fence surrounding a slaughterhouse in Pocatello, Idaho, and led police officers on a wild chase through city streets before they caught up with the heifer and killed it. Pocatello Police Chief Scott Marchand said his officers fired two shots at the bold bovine because it posed a safety risk to the public. The cow had taken off from Anderson Custom Pack, a meat processing plant, on Friday afternoon as it was being prepared for slaughter. High steaks: A Pocatello, Idaho, police officer takes aim at a cow that had escaped from a meat processing plant Friday and led police on a chase through the city . Hoof chase: The 1,000-pound cow was being prepared for slaughter Friday when she made a run for it, jumping a 6-foot fence and fleeing for her life . At around 12.30am, the heifer tipping the scales at 1,000lbs leaped over a fence and ran for her life, reported Idaho State Journal. Early in the police pursuit, an officer shot the hoofed fugitive in the head, but the cow continued galloping. The hurt heifer led cops and animal control officers on a 50-minute chase on foot and in cars, during which she rammed a truck and two patrol vehicles, and rampaged through a playground. The runaway cow was eventually cornered in a residential backyard and was gunned down by an officer. The cow caused only minimal damage to city vehicles, and no one was injured in the incident. The carcass of the animal was then loaded onto a truck and returning to the meat processing plant. Great escape: Early in the police chase, an officer put a bullet in the cow's head, but the wounded animal continued galloping . Nowhere to run: The runaway cow was cornered in a residential backyard after a 50-minute chase . But as it turned out, Friday’s wild cow chase was only the opening act in a bizarre slaughterhouse saga, which played out in Pocatello over the weekend. On Sunday, four more heifers broke free from the same meatpacking plant. One of the horned fugitives met the same fate as the first runaway cow and another animal was captured alive, but two heifers were still at large as of Monday evening. The owners of the Anderson plant said that the four cows had been brought to the facility Saturday and placed in a corral. The next day, employees discovered that gate had been opened, reported the Idaho Statesman. Running amoo-k: The animal rammed three city vehicles and rampaged through a playground . Time to meat her maker: An officer shot the escaped bovine a second time, killing her on the spot . Down for the count: The carcass of the heifer was then loaded onto a truck and returned to the plant . Slaughterhouse five: Between Friday morning and Sunday, a total of five cows fled the plant. Two have been killed and one has been captured alive, but two more are still on the loose . On Monday morning, the four escaped bovines were spotted by Union Pacific Railroad police in the rail yard, prompting another police chase. An Anderson plant worker eventually cornered and killed one of the escapees in a residential area a mile from the facility at around noon Monday. Around the same time, another heifer was captured behind a construction equipment business and returned safely to the slaughterhouse. The two cows that are still at large have been valued at $1,500 each.","The 1,000-pound heifer fled from Anderson Custom Pack plant in Pocatello, Idaho, Friday as it was being prepared for slaughter .

"Cleared: James Lumley-Savile, pictured outside court, was found not guilty after a five-day trial . An aristocrat told a court how an internet date turned sour when the girl he met revealed she had killed two people – including a previous boyfriend. James Lumley-Savile, the great-great-grandson of the Eighth Earl of Scarborough, had taken Ida Pap to a farmer’s market after meeting her through the dating app Tinder. The pair had enjoyed a bottle of wine and then returned to his £800,000 home in Fulham, West London. But the date deteriorated when the Hungarian suddenly revealed she had killed two people – leaving him fearing he could be next, the aristocrat claimed. Mr Lumley-Savile, a former Google employee, said he had reached for two 10in knives in his kitchen to protect himself after she made the shocking claims and became ‘wild and snarling’. But the 39-year-old ended up being arrested and charged when a taxi driver spotted him with the blades outside his home. He was accused of threatening Miss Pap and leaving witnesses fearing for her life. But after a five-day trial at Isleworth Crown Court, jurors cleared him of two counts of knife possession and one of affray. Giving evidence, Mr Lumley-Savile, the son of a war hero, told of the bizarre sequence of events which had led to him appearing in the street with the knives. The heir to the title Baron Savile had spent the day at a farmer’s market and had lunch in Putney before returning to his home. The pair then drank wine and took the drug MDMA, a pure form of ecstasy. He told jurors that after taking the drug Miss Pap started saying some ‘heavy things’, including that she was the product of a rape. And he said he was left fearing for his life when she said she had poisoned her cousin when she was 14 and also stabbed a former boyfriend in a ‘scuffle’, jurors heard. Recalling the incident in May this year, he said: ‘We were in the kitchen, I was thinking “I do not know who this woman is any more, but she is wild and snarling”. ‘I looked behind her and saw the block of kitchen knives. I got a very bad feeling about the situation. She had told me she had killed two people and I thought: “I do not want to be number three.” He said he persuaded Miss Pap to go with him to his brother’s house, adding: ‘I just thought I have got to keep this woman away from here. I was just trying to work out what to do. I had a very bad feeling. ‘I did not want anything to happen to me or her. I wanted this situation to get resolved as nicely as possible.’ Self-defence: Mr Lumley-Savile claimed his girlfriend told him she had killed two people and he thought 'I do not want to be number three' - so he 'subtly' took the block containing his kitchen knives and moved it . He added: ‘Each time I mentioned the police she recoiled. I felt we were in a stalemate and I thought “I am not going to bed with you and those knives in the house”. ‘Then she grabbed her phone and used the Uber app to call a taxi. I have never experienced anything like that before in my life.’ The taxi driver, Qamar Walayat, had told the court he dialled 999 when he arrived to pick up Miss Pap and he thought Mr Lumley-Savile was going to attack her. The aristocrat, dressed in a black suit and striped tie, showed no emotion when the not guilty verdicts were announced. A drugs charge was dropped after he accepted a fixed penalty notice. Mr Lumley-Savile is an identical triplet – a rarity that occurs only once in every eight million births. Both his brothers supported him as character witnesses during the five-day trial. Their father, the Hon Henry Leoline Thornhill Lumley-Savile, was injured in the battle of Monte Cassino in 1944. Last week the Mail reported how the controversial Tinder phone app has become increasingly popular with single middle-aged people. Evidence: Uber taxi driver Qamar Walayat (left) said he saw the 39-year-old (right) brandishing the knives and his girlfriend appeared 'scared', adding: 'I thought he was going to kill her straight away' Deliberations: There were audible sighs of relief from supporters at Isleworth Crown Court, pictured .","James Lumley-Savile, 39, was with Ida Pap  in home in Fulham, London .

"Best-selling children's book The Elf On The Shelf is a disturbing cultural phenomenon which instills in young children the idea that a surveillance state is perfectly acceptable, claims a university professor. Laura Pinto, a digital technology professor at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology, has published a paper in which she argues that the elf has a very sinister undertow. In her recently published paper, Who's The Boss, she claims that the idea of the elf reporting back to Santa each night on the child's behavior 'sets up children for dangerous, uncritical acceptance of power structures.' Professor Laura Pinto believes that the idea of an elf reporting back to Santa each night on a child's behavior 'sets up children for dangerous, uncritical acceptance of power structures' Since it was first published in 2005, The Elf On The Shelf has quickly become an integral part of modern Christmas celebrations. It has sold over six million copies and in 2013 was included as a float in the Macy's Thanksgiving parade for the first time. The story describes how Santa's 'scout elves' hide in people's homes to watch over events. Once everyone goes to bed, the scout elf then flies back to the North Pole to report to Santa the activities - both 'naughty' and 'nice' - that have taken place throughout the day. Before the family wakes up each morning, the scout elf flies back from the North Pole and hides. By hiding in a new spot each morning around the house, the scout elf and the family play an on-going game of hide and seek. Pinto has called the elf 'an external form of non-familial surveillance,' and says it is potentially conditioning children to accept state surveillance too. Since it was first published in 2005, The Elf On The Shelf has sold over 6 million copies and in 2013 it was included as a float in the Macy's Thanksgiving parade for the first time . 'If you grow up thinking it's cool for the elves to watch me and report back to Santa, well, then it's cool for the NSA to watch me and report back to the government,' she told Inside Halton. Pinto isn't the first person to criticize and question the message that The Elf On The Shelf teaches kids. Atlantic columnist Kate Tuttle called it 'a marketing juggernaut dressed up as a ""tradition""', and its purpose 'to spy on kids' as inappropriate for the holiday season. Washington Post reviewer Hank Stuever characterized the concept as 'just another nannycam in a nanny state obsessed with penal codes.' Writing for Psychology Today, Dr. David Kyle Johnston called it a 'dangerous parental crutch', with much the same reasoning as what he terms the 'Santa lie.' The best-selling book was written and self-published by American author Carol Aebersold and her daughter Chanda Bell . In her paper, Pinto also argues that the book teaches children to potentially cater to The Elf On The Shelf as the 'other,' rather than engaging in and honing understandings of social relationships with peers, parents, teachers and 'real life' others. 'You're teaching (kids) a bigger lesson, which is that it's OK for other people to spy on you and you're not entitled to privacy,' she tells the Toronto Star.","The best-selling children's book tells the story of an elf reporting back to Santa each night on a child's behavior .

"Gaby Scanlon drank two shots of Jagermeister laced with liquid nitrogen when she fell ill . A wine bar is being prosecuted after it served a freezing liquid nitrogen cocktail to a teenager who was celebrating her 18th birthday and left her needing her stomach removed. Gaby Scanlon, from Heysham in Lancashire, drank two shots of the liqueur Jagermeister, which had been laced with the chemical, with friends at Oscar's Wine Bar in Lancaster in October 2012. But soon after the drink she was doubled over in pain and her friends drove her straight to Lancaster Royal Infirmary where a CT scan found a large perforation. The student spent three weeks in hospital as doctors removed her stomach and connected her oesophagus directly to her small bowel. During a four hour emergency operation they found the extremely low temperature of the liquid nitrogen had burned a hole in her stomach and completely destroyed the stomach lining. The super-cold chemical creates a dramatic dry-ice effect as it evaporates at room temperature. As a gas it is harmless, but the much colder liquid freezes objects on contact in seconds. Today Lancaster City Council announced that court proceedings will take place against the George Street wine bar, one of its directors and an employee. In a statement the council said: 'Andrew Dunn, of Yorkshire, has been summoned to court to answer charges under sections 3(1), 33(1)(a) and 37 of the Health and Safety at Work Act etc 1974 in relation to his role as a director of Oscar's Wine Bar.

"Labour was accused of insulting the victims of the Mid Staffs hospital scandal last night after its health spokesman suggested it would have been better if the report into their deaths had never been published. Andy Burnham said events had borne out his view that the benefits of a public inquiry had not outweighed the reputational damage to the hospital. The Francis report into Mid Staffs Hospital unveiled a catalogue of neglect and abuse that contributed to up to 1,200 needless deaths from 2005 to 2009. Mr Burnham provoked a flood of comments on Twitter after attacking Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt over the growing crisis in A&E . The report also savaged the then Labour government's target culture, blaming it for prioritising box-ticking over patient care. On Saturday Mr Burnham provoked a flood of comments on Twitter after attacking Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt over the growing crisis in A&E. In response Shaun Lintern, a reporter on the Health Service Journal, pointed out that Mr Burnham had always blocked a full public inquiry into Mid Staffs while in office, preferring a more limited probe. Mr Burnham replied: 'I was worried that a full public inquiry would damage the trust beyond repair. Think that's been borne out.' Mr Hunt last night condemned Mr Burnham's comment and said it was clear Labour had not learned the central lesson of the scandal, that patients should be put first. 'It's an insult to the victims of Mid Staffs that the Labour Party is still denying the need for a full public inquiry into the awful events at that hospital,' said Mr Hunt. 'The Francis Inquiry recommended a fundamental change in the culture of care in the NHS. If Labour refuse to accept its findings then they cannot be trusted to run the NHS.' Mr Hunt last night condemned Mr Burnham's comment and said it was clear Labour had not learned the central lesson of the scandal, that patients should be put first . Mr Burnham's intervention prompted an angry reaction from some relatives of the victims of the scandal. Julie Bailey, who blew the whistle on Mid Staffs after the death of her mother at the hospital, said: 'The message he's sending out is that it is better to cover things up than criticise the NHS, however bad things are. 'The inquiry uncovered huge failings in the NHS, and he thinks it shouldn't have taken place at all. It is very worrying, because if he becomes Health Secretary again at the election it is clear we would go straight back to the old days of covering up.' Deb Hazeldine, who was yesterday marking the anniversary of her mother's death at Mid Staffs, said Mr Burnham's comments had left her in tears. In a direct message to him, she said: 'I didn't want to damage any reputations, Mr Burnham. I just wanted other daughters to take their mums home.' Mr Burnham appointed QC Robert Francis to investigate Mid Staffs in 2009 but blocked calls for a public inquiry, saying it would be too 'distracting for managers'. His Tory successor Andrew Lansley upgraded the investigation to a full public inquiry after the Coalition took office in 2010. The Francis report uncovered evidence of similar scandals in other NHS hospitals and produced 290 recommendations to improve patient care and safety. Last night Mr Burnham said his comments had been misunderstood. He said the lessons could have been learned without a full public inquiry. And he accused ministers of failing to stand by the hospital trust as its reputation was shredded in public. Mr Hunt announced this year that the trust is to be dissolved. Mr Burnham said: 'I did not oppose a public inquiry when it was proposed by Andrew Lansley. But I always worried that a lengthy public inquiry might have implications for the hospital and said the Government should provide it with more public support, which I don't think it did.'","Shadow Health Secretary said benefits of a public inquiry had not outweighed the reputational damage to the hospital .
Francis report into Mid Staffs Hospital unveiled a catalogue of neglect and abuse that contributed to up to 1,200 needless deaths from 2005 to 2009 .

"Savvy: Mandy Willis, 55, took a call from a man claiming to be a Microsoft security expert named 'David' from Pakistan, but realised it was a scam . A mother-of-two claims she convinced a conman to give up his criminal lifestyle - after he tried to scam her into handing over personal information over the phone. Mandy Willis, 55, took a call from a man claiming to be a Microsoft security expert named 'David' from Pakistan, who said that he needed access to her computer in order to fix a virus. But Ms Willis, from Bristol, said that she realised it was a scam designed to trick her into giving him access to the computer - and the sensitive information stored on it. Rather than hang up the phone, the party planner decided to chat to the caller - asking him why he made a living from ripping people off. She told him that this was his 'wake up call' and urged him to give up his life of crime and look for a job that would 'make his children proud'. Ms Willis, who lives with her partner, claimed that he called her back 10 days later saying that he had left his days as a conman behind him and was now on the hunt for a legitimate job. She said: 'This man had gone off the path and he just needed a little nudge back on. 'When you deal with it in a horrible way you feel cross afterwards - it's a residue that stays with you. 'When I dealt with it in a positive way I felt much nicer - it's a good thing for everyone.' Ms Willis, who used to slam the phone down on cold callers, added that she spoke to David just days after she made a decision that she would be nicer to them. She said: 'I didn't have long to think about how I was going to deal with it differently. 'He started saying he was from Microsoft and there was a virus on my computer and went on like that in the way they do. 'But I started to talk over him. I said ""do you really want to help me? I'm not sure that you really do"". Gradually he went quiet and started listening to me. 'I said to him ""I think you know that this is not truthful, and not honest, and not the path you should be choosing"". 'It sound like a lecture now I think about it, and he went really quiet and I thought he was going to put down the phone but he said to me ""I think about that every day"".' New tack: Ms Willis, who lives with her partner in Bristol, said decided to treat callers with more kindness just days before 'David' phoned. The mother-of-two claims to have convinced him to give up his criminal lifestyle . Ms Willis claimed that she told the man this was his 'wake up call' and urged him to walk out on the scam and find legitimate work. She added: 'I told him ""You're never going to be happy or proud doing a job like this"". 'This scam isn't going to catch out people like me, but it might catch out someone who is not computer literate, like my mother - that's people like your grandparents. 'He said ""yes"" and I said that he should do something that makes his children proud. 'We wished each other a good day and I thought that was that.' But around ten days later she said that she received a call from 'David', who told her he had put his criminal life in his past. She said: 'First of all I thought it was another scam phone call but he asked ""do you remember me?"" and I realised who it was. 'He said he had phoned me up to tell me that he had left his job. I told him I thought that was amazing and thanked him for phoning me. 'I asked him how it made him feel and he said he can finally sleep at night. It's just wonderful.' Ms Willis is now urging other people to engage with phone scammers in an attempt to get them to turn their back on their criminal ways.","Mandy Willis answered the phone to a man claiming to be from Microsoft .

"Former NFL superstar Chad Johnson left a $300 tip for a waitress at a restaurant in Montreal on Sunday and wanted the world to know about it. Leaving modesty aside, the footballer tweeted the check for his meal adding a reason for his generosity: 'Sundays are slow, this should help,' he wrote. Giving himself a huge pat on the back, the footballer formerly known as Ochocinco attempted to dish out some wise words along with the cash, 'The tip is in the message not the money...' he posted to Twitter. Tipped off: Former NFL superstar wide receiver Chad Johnson left a $300 tip for a waitress on Sunday . Wise words: According to Johnson, who still uses 'ochocinco' for his Twitter handle, 'The tip is in the message not the money …' While he may be renowned for his skills on the field, it's when it comes to math where Johnson appears to be lacking. He racked up a bill for $351.92 and left a tip of another $300.92 making the bill total $652.84. Owning up: Many on Twitter laid into Johnson over his math skills after incorrectly adding up the total . However, perhaps distracted by his own good deed, Johnson incorrectly added the total up as $651.92. Bizarrely, he also wrote 'I LOVE YOU!!!' at the bottom of the check. His generous gift was well received on Twitter although a number were mocking him for his poor math skills. It's believed Johnson is desperate to make a return to the NFL and is doing whatever he can to draw attention, however he appears to no longer in demand. He didn't have a bad season in the CFL for the Montreal Alouettes but there do not appear to be any options for him to move south of the border any time soon. Johnson was a six-time Pro Bowl selection in his 11-year NFL career, spent primarily with the Bengals. His last NFL action came in 2011 as a member of the Patriots. He was invited to training camp with the Dolphins in 2012 but was released after he was arrested for domestic battery. Johnson reached a plea deal which allowed him to avoid jail time and was instead sentenced to probation. During a court appearance for violating his probation in June 2013, Johnson reached a deal to avoid jail time but the judge rejected the deal after Johnson playfully smacked his attorney's behind. He was sentenced to 30 days in jail.","Former Bengals star and current Montreal Alouette Chad Johnson racked up a bill for $351.92 and another $300 as a tip .

"Bag carrier: David Mellor leaves a radio station with an unknown woman on Saturday . If David Mellor was hoping to blend in with the crowd, this bag was not the way to do it. Covered in gaudy pink swirls, it stuck out like a sore thumb as he walked through Leicester Square in central London on his way home from presenting his LBC radio show. But as he strolled out with a woman who left the offices with him, he looked perfectly at ease – and between them, they even managed to get a taxi, despite Mr Mellor’s recent rant at a driver. The former Tory minister, 65, was caught on tape last month calling a cabbie a ‘sweaty, stupid little git’ when he became furious at the route taken by the driver after a visit to Buckingham Palace, where Mr Mellor’s partner Lady Cobham had received a CBE. Mr Mellor yelled: ‘I’ve been in the Cabinet, I’m an award-winning broadcaster, I’m a Queen’s Counsel’, before demanding: ‘Who are you to question me?’ Cabbies vowed to refuse to pick up Mr Mellor as a result. But on Saturday, when these pictures were taken, his unusual bag – and not his language – was the most colourful thing on display. An onlooker said: ‘He came out of the radio station with the woman and they walked through the square. She raised her arm to hail the taxi. ‘As soon as it stopped, they both stepped out on the street and Mr Mellor opened the door for her, said something to the driver then got in himself. There didn’t seem to be any problem.’ It was unclear if Mr Mellor was, in an act of chivalry, carrying the eye-catching bag for the unknown woman, who herself was carrying a large black and white bag, or if it was his own.

"A taxi driver has admitted killing a woman in a 'frenzied' attack with a hammer and a knife before sawing her legs off and burying her at a beauty spot. Martin Bell said God told him to kill 23-year-old Gemma Simpson when she was at his flat in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, 14 years ago. The 45-year-old, who handed himself into police earlier this year, said he gave Miss Simpson the opportunity to get away but killed her after he thought she had threatened his children. Killed: Gemma Simpson (left) was 23 when she was attacked by Martin Bell (right) at his flat in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, in May 2000. The court heard that he told Miss Simpson that God had told him to kill her . He had been sectioned for six months before the attack and was around six weeks before he killed Miss Simpson. Bell pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility when he appeared at Leeds Crown Court today. Simon Myerson QC told the court Bell launched a 'frenzied' attack in which he repeatedly struck Miss Simpson with a hammer. He said: 'At the flat, the defendant told Gemma that God wanted him to kill her.' Bell then stabbed her in the back and neck an 'enormous' and 'uncountable' number of times with a kitchen knife. Mr Myerson said: 'His intent was for her not to be in pain.' On the day of her death, Miss Simpson met Bell at Leeds railway station before going back to Bell’s flat in Harrogate. Buried: Bell wrapped Miss Simpson's body in a sleeping bag and secured it with a padlock 'so she couldn't get out'. He sawed off her legs before driving to Brimhham Rocks, Harrogate (above) where she was buried . After the brutal attack, Bell filled a bath with water and left Miss Simpson in it for four days with her hands tied behind her back because he was 'frightened she would come back to life'. Mr Myerson said Bell closed the shower curtain so he did not have to see the body and repainted his flat with lilac paint to cover the blood stains. He hired a car but found that he could not fit Miss Simpson's body in the boot, so he sawed off the bottom of his victim's legs. Missing: Miss Simpson's mother, Linda Umpleby, pictured, with a photo of her and her daughter . He wrapped Miss Simpson's body in a sleeping bag and secured it with chains and a padlock 'so she couldn't get out'. Bell, who has been diagnosed with psychotic illness, told police he did this 'as fast as I could so I wasn't sick'. He then drove her to Brimham Rocks, near Harrogate, where he dug a hole with a shovel and buried her. Mr Myerson told the court that Bell, who was 30 at the time of the attack, had known Miss Simpson for around five years. Bell was questioned by police after Miss Simpson was reported missing and said the young woman had called him to ask if she could stay with him but he had not seen her that day. In July this year, Bell rang a former girlfriend and told her he had killed someone 14 years ago. He then handed himself in at Scarborough police station. During his interviews, Bell took police to Brimham Rocks and showed them where he had buried Miss Simpson, and her remains were recovered. He said he had visited the site four or fives times since Miss Simpson’s death. Bell told police he had considered confessing in the past but his mother was still alive and he was concerned about losing his freedom. Paul Greaney QC, defending Bell, told the court the defendant heard voices telling him to do things and had 'developed complex delusional beliefs' which saw him moving around the country because he believed a group of men were trying to kill him. He had been sectioned in a mental hospital for around nine months in August 1999 and was released around six weeks before he killed Miss Simpson. Mr Greaney said the doctor who discharged Bell accepted that the delusions had not disappeared at that stage. Attack: On the day of her death, Miss Simpson met Bell at Leeds railway station before going back to Bell’s flat in Harrogate. After he bludgeoned Miss Simpson to death, Bell drove her body to Brimham Rocks . A psychiatric report carried out after Bell’s arrest diagnosed his mental illness as schizophrenia. Mr Greaney said: 'At the time of the killing, Martin Bell was suffering from a serious mental illness which substantially impaired his mental responsibility in doing what he did in killing Gemma Simpson.' He added: 'The killing would not have occurred had he been well.' Mr Greaney said if Bell had not handed himself in to police, 'he would probably have gone to his own grave without ever being punished'. The Recorder of Leeds, Judge Peter Collier QC, said he would sentence Bell on Friday. Admission: Bell, now 45, pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility when he appeared at Leeds Crown Court today. The court heard how he was sectioned six weeks before the attack .","Martin Bell, then 30, met Gemma Simpson, 23, at Leeds train station in 2000 .

"A nursery has been closed and police are investigating amid claims that a child there was force-fed. The Park Town Nursery in Oxford had its registration suspended by Ofsted over concerns for the welfare of children following allegations of assault. Police yesterday declined to elaborate on the nature of the alleged incidents, although sources close to the investigation said they were not of a sexual nature. However, sources close to the £50-a-day nursery said the incident related to a child being forced to finish his dinner. Park Town Nursery in Oxford has been closed while police investigate claims a child there was force-fed . The unit, which caters for 24 children aged three months to five years, is situated in the grounds of the exclusive Dragon School, where alumni include Emma Watson and Hugh Laurie. One source said: ‘For whatever reason, a boy did not want to eat what was served up at meal time and he was told he would have to. ‘It is a very unfortunate incident. Pre-school children can be fussy eaters, there is nothing unusual in the boy’s conduct. ‘What is unusual is that for whatever reason, a member of staff decided he would be made to eat this meal. ‘I feel sorry for Sara Mander, the proprietor. She is a totally dedicated professional.’ Dr Ying Groves, whose son George now attends Lynams, the Dragon School pre-prep, said: ‘It’s very surprising because the teacher accused of force-feeding is our favourite. Proprietor, Sara Mander, claimed the allegations were 'nothing major' and is confident the nursery will be open again before the end of the year . ‘She is a very calm, gentle person, but maybe she was force-feeding a child so somebody called in Ofsted. I think there was some shouting at the children as well. They just shut straight away after that. We are just shocked. Our experience of the nursery has only been a positive one.’ Mrs Mander, a married mother of three, claimed the allegations were ‘nothing major’ when she was contacted by a local news agency reporter on Thursday. She said she was confident the centre would re-open before the end of the year. She twice hung up the telephone when contacted by the Daily Mail. A police spokesman said: ‘Thames Valley Police attended a nursery in Bardwell Road, Oxford, alongside other agencies on November 18. ‘This was in response to information received about the care of children at the nursery. ‘Officers and representatives from other agencies spoke to the parents of the children. Thames Valley Police is investigating the circumstances and this investigation is ongoing. There have not been any arrests.’ The force declined to comment on the force-feeding allegation. At its most recent Ofsted inspection, in 2012, the nursery was rated ‘good’. The watchdog confirmed it had suspended the nursery following claims that ‘raised concerns about children’s welfare and the leadership and management of the nursery’, but declined to comment further. Ian Caws, bursar at Dragon School, said: ‘The nursery is an independent business, which leases its facilities from the Dragon School. As we have no involvement in its management we have no knowledge of the reasons for its closure by Ofsted and no right to demand it.’ The Daily Mail was unable to contact the staff member said to be responsible for forcing the child to eat his dinner.","Police investigating allegations of assault at Park Town Nursery in Oxford .

"A television antiques expert told of his anger yesterday after thieves escaped with up to £200,000 worth of watches, diamonds and jewellery in a ram raid on his business. Tom Keane, who has featured in programmes such as Cash in the Attic, Bargain Hunt and Dickinson's Real Deal, said a masked and gloved gang broke in to the village antiques centre in the early hours of the morning. The four-strong gang - all wearing balaclavas - were caught on CCTV attempting to drag a safe off the premises using the stolen Land Rover they used as a getaway car. Tom Keane, an antiques expert who has appeared on Cash in the Attic and Bargain Hunt, had his business plundered by raiders wearing balaclavas . They escaped with the contents of a jewellery cabinet in the reception area of his Oxfordshire business, The Swan at Tetsworth - based in a converted coaching inn - during the early hours of Friday. Yesterday Mr Keane, who lives in West London, told how police missed the gang by just three minutes after they were automatically summoned to the village by the antique centre's alarm system. He said: 'One glass cabinet had over £100,000 of watches in it. 'The police have told us that this is the fifth or sixth antiques business to be hit across Berkshire and Oxfordshire in the last few months - although we did not find out about the other raids until after we were hit. 'It is organised crime. The gang stole the Land Rover from North Oxfordshire and dumped it up the road after the raid.' Mr Keane, a father-of-three and grandfather of five, said he was still working to establish exactly what had been taken in the raid. 'Smoke bombs went off as part of the security system and there is stuff all over the floor', he said, adding that Rolex watches from the 1970s and 1980s, jewellery and diamonds were known to be amongst the haul taken. The auctioneer said the items stolen had a combined value of between £150,000 and £200,000 . Mr Keane (seen in the ITV programme Auction Party in 2010) said police were examining CCTV footage from the night in question . Some of the timepieces were solid gold with custom-made diamond faces, he said. He estimated the total value of the items to be between £150,000 to £200,000. He said officers were now studying CCTV of the raid, as well as earlier footage from the system to see if any potential gang members can be identified 'casing out' the premises. 'We have already found images of a man in a balaclava looking through the windows two nights before the raid', he added. Thames Valley Police spokesman said: 'We were called after an alarm went off. A side door was forced and a glass cabinet containing jewellery and antiques was smashed. Items are missing.' Mr Keane has spent 25 years in the antiques business, beginning as a car boot sale trader before eventually taking over Chiswick Auctions in west London. He specialises in art and antiques from the 17th to the 20th Century and acts as a consultant valuer for television companies and clients including interior designers and dealers. The Swan at Tetsworth, near Thame, represents 80 antique dealers in 40 showrooms of top quality English, French and country furniture, as well as smaller decorative antiques.","Tom Keane's antiques business was robbed by a gang of thieves .

"Russia is boasting that a long term spy in Nato country Estonia spilled secrets to Moscow from Britain's MI5 secret service and other Western intelligence agencies. His espionage meant that the KGB knew the scale of intelligence activities by the American National Security Agency in Europe long before Edward Snowden's disclosures, it was alleged. Soviet-era KGB officer Uno Puusepp was allowed to join Tallinn's KAPO secret service after the break-up of the USSR - and during at least a decade and a half as a double agent for Moscow, he went on to do significant damage to the UK, US and other European Union allies, claimed the documentary. Spy boast: Soviet-era KGB officer Uno Puusepp (pictured) was allowed to join Estonia's secret service after the break-up of the USSR - and went on to do significant damage to the UK, US and other European Union allies, the Kremlin claims . Mole: A trusted insider in KAPO, he had access to key Western secrets, Moscow says . A Russian documentary about Puusepp showed footage purporting to include classified correspondence from Western intelligence agencies including MI5 (pictured) He was revealed as the source of evidence in 2001 used to convict Valery Ojamae, a former Russian Foreign Intelligence officer, to seven years in jail after was accused of secretly working for the British and Estonian secret services. Pro-Kremlin television channel NTV, owned by Gazprom, revealed his role in a 40 minute film made in close co-operation with Vladimir Putin's FSB secret service. A trusted insider in KAPO, he had access to key Western secrets in the strategic Baltic region after he was recruited to bug communications through wiretapping, according to the programme which appeared to be used for propaganda purposes at a time of sour relations between Moscow and Tallinn. 'During this time, the FSB uncloaked several large-scale anti-Russian espionage and technical actions by the U.S, Swedish, British and other special services,' claimed the programme. Footage was shown purported to include classified correspondence from Western intelligence agencies including MI5. 'Several agents of foreign special services were convicted, and a leak was prevented of classified information via a device that was to be inserted into a Russian telecommunication cable [for] the technical penetration of the Russian Embassy in Tallinn.' The programme's narrator stated: 'There are few people in Russia who have done more for its security than the Estonian Uno Puusepp and his handler, former KGB officer Nikolay Yermakov.' Claim: The documentary said that 'owing to Puusepp, the scale of intelligence activities by the US National Security Agency in Europe became known before Edward Snowden came up with his disclosures' It alleged that Estonia was the 'weakest link' in the Nato intelligence system 'largely thanks to a modest KAPO officer, Uno Puusepp' who knew the details of Western recruitment of agents deployed against Russia, and on the surveillance of Moscow's diplomats. NTV said that 'owing to Puusepp, the scale of intelligence activities by the US National Security Agency in Europe became known before Edward Snowden came up with his disclosures'. His controller Yermakov claimed: 'In the entire period of Uno's work, I believe the Estonian security police's work against Russia was devalued by about 80 per cent.' Puusepp now living in Russia - was a selfless idealist who had 'always stressed that he did not want to harm Estonia as a state' and who had never received any money for the information he provided. The son of a KGB agent, he was inspired to spy for Moscow because of the 'Russophobia' and 'fascism' he saw in newly-independent Estonia. The film alleged Estonian intelligence services were incompetent and subservient to the United States. It alleged Russian-speaking Estonians were recruited to snoop on Russian defence facilities including a Sukhoi aircraft design bureau in Astrakhan Region. The former head of Estonian intelligence Raivo Aeg - dismissed by the NTV programme as 'a somewhat stupid drillmaster' - had handed Puusepp a tape of his conversation with a senior US espionage official who had warned of a Russian mole inside the Tallinn secret service. Fearing that his cover could soon be blown, Puusepp stayed in KAPO avoiding exposure, it was claimed. 'The Americans and the KaPo leadership hunted the traitor for several years.' But then they arrested the wrong man, Vladimir Veitman, also a former Estonian KGB officer, it was claimed. 'Of course, I was very surprised that instead of me it was my colleague Veitman who had been arrested - as far as I knew, he'd passed over absolutely no information,' said Puusepp. 'I was very surprised when they arrested my colleague, Veitman, who, as far as I knew, had not passed any information at all,' said Puusepp. Puusepp claimed to have gone public to highlight how Ukraine is now being cajoled into the Western world in an American plot to undermine Russia. 'I have a good memory of what happened in Estonia a little over 20 years ago. In principle, exactly the same things are happening in Ukraine,' he said. 'Under the banner of democracy and various values that all normal people respect, forces led by the Americans, dark forces, come to power, and there is just one enemy - Russia.' He is believed to have been active from around 1996 to 2011. Tallinn was today studying the claims.","Russia claims ex KGB agent Uno Puusepp was a double agent for them .

"Colour Sergeant Stephen Bardsley, 57, took his own life months after his wife Margaret died of a brain tumour . A Falklands War hero who was decorated by the Queen for saving wounded comrades has taken his own life months after his wife died of a brain tumour. Colour Sergeant Stephen Bardsley, 57, placed the last love letter ever written to him by childhood sweetheart Margaret on his bed before hanging himself. The retired paratrooper took his life in June this year days after the anniversary of the Battle of Goose Green when 10 of his comrades died and he dodged gunfire to save an eleventh. He was said to have grown increasingly upset on the 32nd anniversary and sent a series of texts, before writing a letter to his wife saying: 'I can't wait to go away this weekend with you.' The decorated soldier had been married to Mrs Bardsley for 33 years after meeting when they were both 10 years old and they had three children together. But his life began to crumble when she was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2013 and died last December aged 56, an inquest heard. Their eldest daughter, Catherine Disbury, 32, told the hearing how Mr Bardsley became a full time carer for his wife but her illness came as a 'terrible blow'. She said the former soldier turned champion bodybuilder began to drink heavily and told his family: 'when your mum goes, I will follow'. He had served with the 2nd Battalion of the Parachute Regiment and in 1982 was embroiled in the deadly battle for Goose Green during the Falklands conflict. Ten of his comrades were killed in the fighting but despite being forced to retreat by Argentinian soldiers he dodged gunfire and risked his own life to rescue an eleventh as he lay wounded. He received a Military Medal for bravery in battle on land and was later awarded the United States Bronze Star Medal in 1993 for 'exceptionally meritorious achievements' in the first Gulf War. The decorated soldier had been married to Mrs Bardsley for 33 years after meeting when they were both 10 years old and they had three children together . Mr Bardsley then won a British Empire Medal before leaving the forces in 2001 and running his own gym. He kept his medals in a bedroom drawer at home and later sold then in 2012 for £118,000. Ms Disbury told the hearing how he kept saying he did not want to be alive and just wanted to be with their mother. He even stopped taking medication for an existing heart condition with the hope that he would have a heart attack. Mr Bardsley received a Military Medal for bravery in battle after he dodged gunfire and risked his own life to rescue a comrade as he lay wounded . Their eldest daughter, Catherine Disbury (right), 32, told the hearing how Mr Bardsley became a full time carer for his wife (left) but her illness came as a 'terrible blow' 'I was seriously worried about his well-being. It was clear from his behaviour he was not in a good place and was angry. He was talking about the Falklands. I think it was the anniversary of the Falklands or of Goose Green,' said Ms Disbury. A few days before his death he said: 'I am a machine that won't or cannot be broken until I decide to turn it off.' One text said: 'I am about as interesting as a garden slug these days but I used to have my moments. I am still drinking. It's not big, not clever but it works for me.' Another text read: 'I need to un**** myself before we end up burying another Bardsley.' In a statement she said her father had told her he had buried 10 men on the day of the battle and was 'very upset when he said it.' She said that since leaving the Army he felt he was a 'nobody' and felt as he got older he had no purpose in life. When asked his name he quoted Colour Sergeant Stephen Bardsley only to add: 'I used to be but now I am nobody.' 'When I was informed that he had taken his own life I was shocked but I was surprised it had taken this long after the death of my mum,' she said. 'He thought that now my sisters and I had grown up and my mum had gone nobody needed him. It was not obviously how we felt.' Mr Bardsley's close friend Jason Cunningham, a fireman, told the inquest: 'He said he wanted to end his life to be with Margaret and he said it quite a lot.' He placed the last love letter ever written to him by childhood sweetheart Margaret on his bed before hanging himself, pictured with their daughter Catherine . Ms Disbury said the former soldier turned champion bodybuilder began to drink heavily and told his family: 'when your mum goes, I will follow' The Military Medal (MM) was awarded for acts of gallantry and devotion to duty under fire to personnel of the British Army and other services. It was discontinued in 1993 and since then the Military Cross has been awarded to personnel of all ranks within the British honours system. The medal bears the inscription 'For Bravery In The Field' in four lines, surrounded by a laurel wreath. It is the second highest military bravery honour behind the Victoria Cross. He tried to text Mr Bardsley but when he got no response went his home in Moston and found his body next to a note from his wife. It said: 'I just wanted you to know I love you all the world and more. I can't wait to go away this weekend with you.' Police also recovered a series of text messages from his phone, one which said: 'I am about as interesting as a garden slug these days but I used to have my moments. I am still drinking. It's not big, not clever but it works for me.' Another text read 'I need to un**** myself before we end up burying another Bardsley.' Assistant Coroner for Manchester, Nick Stanage recorded a conclusion of suicide and said: 'It is clear to me that sadly the evidence in this case goes only one way. I offer my sincere condolences for such a difficult loss.' Speaking after the inquest Miss Disbury said: 'He had three big medals and for a time was the most decorated Non Commissioned Officer in all the British army. We all had a great relationship with him. We were all great friends. We played a lot of sport together and he would come and watch me play hockey. 'Our mother was a very healthy lady and she played hockey right up to a few years ago. She was diagnosed with a brain tumour and shortly after we found out it was terminal. After about three months she deteriorated. My parents were childhood sweethearts and he just struggled to cope without her. 'I don't think his death it was a spur of the moment thing but something that happened in a bad moment. 'Dad was extremely brave, dedicated and loyal but he just struggled with the loss of my mum and he felt he didn't have any purpose. We had a great upbringing, travelling all over the world. He still used to come watch me play hockey. He was a really proud man.'

"'Under pressure': Stuart Beddows hanged himself at his home in Walsall, West Midlands, in September . A dedicated nurse killed himself just weeks after he voiced concerns over the pressure created by staff shortages at the hospital where he worked. Stuart Beddows hanged himself at his home in Walsall, West Midlands, in September, after suffering from stress, an inquest held last month heard. It was told that the 43-year-old had felt burdened by the death of a former patient, and was worried about the introduction of a new computer system at the hospital. Today, Mr Beddows' family has spoken of his death, saying that he 'loved' nursing but that 'pressure built up'. Mr Beddows, who was lead nurse in the endoscopy unit at Walsall Manor Hospital, was found dead in his home after friends and family could not contact him. At the inquest, Black County coroner Zafar Siddique ruled Mr Beddows intended to take his own life. Director of nursing for the hospital Kathryn Halford told the hearing that colleagues were aware Mr Beddows was suffering from stress and tried to offer him support, according to the Express & Star. She said problems with the new computer system added to his pressures, and said his colleagues were concerned about the hours he was working without breaks. He was also worried about the work needed for an upcoming hospital assessment, she claimed. But she said the most important concern appeared to be the death of a young woman, who died on readmission to hospital three days after he had performed an endoscopic procedure on her. She told the inquest: 'Her death was nothing to do with the endoscopy, it was entirely different, and staff spent a lot of time talking to him about it.' Mrs Halford added that Mr Beddows had been offered help to deal with his problems, but had declined the offer. The inquest was also told that on July 14 he had talked to his GP about the pressures of work, but did not take his advice to take time off work. Speaking at the time, Mr Siddique said: 'The new computer system introduced was causing a backlog of patients, and there was the patient who died following a procedure. 'There was support from colleagues, but he was affected by that.' Today, his mother Maureen, 74, said that he 'loved being a nurse' but said that he felt 'people's lives were at risk in his department because of the lack of staff'. Strained: The inquest was told that Mr Beddows, 43, had felt burdened by the death of a former patient, and was worried about the introduction of a new computer system at the hospital . She said: 'He would work more than 12 hours a day, only having time for one cup of coffee. There just wasn't enough staff and he was working evenings and Saturdays too.' She claimed that in the months leading up to his death he was working 14-hour days, six days a week. She added that she blamed Government cuts to the NHS and his workload for his death. Mr Beddows began his nursing training when he was 18 before getting a permanent job at Walsall Manor Hospital in in 1999. He worked his way up to lead nurse practitioner in endoscopy but was soon working up to 80 hours or more a week to cover staff shortages, his family claimed today. Mrs Beddows said: 'It was always a very stressful position, any nursing job when dealing with people's lives is. But as time went on, the stress and pressure built up.' Mr Beddows' sister, Mandy Hicken, said: 'There wasn't enough staff. He was working long hours without proper lunch breaks. 'I remember him telling me that he worked a 12-hour shift and had only enough time to drink one cup of coffee - there was no time for food. 'He was also working extra clinics during the evening and at weekends. It was all classed as overtime but he needed to do it. 'Over the last two weeks of his life he was going in a 7am and finishing at 9pm. He said he had asked for more help, but he was given bank nurses and they weren't up to his standards. 'He wasn't supported and the resources weren't there. We were told he was offered counselling, but he said he needed more than that - he needed help with his workload.' Support: Kathryn Halford, director of nursing for Walsall Manor Hospital, above, where Mr Beddows worked,  told the inquest that colleagues were aware that he was suffering from stress and tried to offer him support . Stuart's other sister Andrea Stringer said: 'He was a happy go-lucky person and would help anybody. Since his death we have been contacted by so many people grateful for his treatment, even someone from Australia got in touch. He treated patients really well, put them at ease.' Richard Kirby, chief executive of Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust, said: 'The outcome of the inquest in November reflected our own internal review that Stuart was experiencing a high level of stress in the workplace. 'His line manager and colleagues were aware of this and had responded by offering a number of supportive solutions. 'We are very sorry that we were not able to help Stuart further to prevent this tragedy. 'We already had a number of support mechanisms in place such as an Emotional Health and Wellbeing service and Occupational Health service which are both easily accessible to our staff. 'We have strengthened these services recently with staff being actively encouraged to raise concerns about their colleagues through various open channels if they feel that someone needs support.'

"Ed Miliband’s set-piece speech outlining Labour’s pledge to tackle immigration lasted just 7 minutes and 43 seconds today – sparking fresh criticism that he was not taking the issue seriously. The Labour leader arrived in the key marginal seat of Great Yarmouth this morning to unveil his election pledge to jail company bosses who exploit cheap foreign workers to undercut British wages. He also pledged to introduce ‘proper’ entry and exit checks, limit on in-work benefits for EU migrants, and extend the period before which immigrants can claim out-of-work benefits to two years. Labour leader Ed Miliband's set piece address on immigration lasted just 463 seconds today . But his 463-second address was overshadowed by a leaked party document telling party activists to ‘move the conversation on’ from immigration if voters bring it up on the doorstep. The paper, setting out plans to counter the challenge from Ukip, was sent to dozens of MPs in constituencies where Ukip threatens to rob the opposition of the votes needed to return to power at next May's general election. At the end of his speech on immigration Mr Miliband described the document as ‘not very well drafted’ but said there could be no suggestion he was seeking to dodge the issue. He said: ‘I think what matters about our party is what I'm saying on this stage - the pledge we're making rather than some not very well drafted language in a briefing document. I don't think anybody's in any doubt where Labour stands on this.’ Mr Miliband added: ‘We're very clear about this, that's why I'm standing on this stage with our pledge on immigration. The Labour Party not only takes this seriously, but I've changed Labour's approach.’ During his speech, Mr Miliband insisted: ‘When people worry about the real impact immigration has, this Labour Party will always respond to those concerns, not dismiss them. ‘It isn't prejudiced to worry about immigration, it is understandable.’ During his speech, Mr Miliband insisted that Labour would respond to concerns about the 'real impact immigration' Mr Miliband has a demonstration on how to mix paint by customer advisor Tim Mobbs, as he meets staff at a B&Q DIY superstore in Great Yarmouth . Mr Miliband said he wants to end an ‘epidemic of exploitation’ which has led to ‘truly shocking’ examples of migrant workers having their wages withheld and being forced to live in appalling conditions. ‘When people can be exploited for low wages or endangered at work, it drags the whole system down, undercutting the pay and conditions of local workers,’ said the Labour leader. ‘We must end the epidemic of exploitation. We must stop people's living standards being undermined by scandalous undercutting.’ Setting out his new proposals, he said: ‘We are serving notice on employers who bring workers here under duress or on false terms and pay them significantly lower wages, with worse terms and conditions. ‘We will make it a criminal offence to undercut pay or conditions by exploiting migrant workers.’ Aides said that bringing in foreign labour to undercut the pay and conditions of existing workers will not be sufficient, under Labour's plans, to secure a prosecution on its own, but it could be used as a piece of evidence of exploitation. Mr Miliband's speech was overshadowed by a leaked party document . To secure a conviction, evidence will be needed that an abuse of power has occurred and that migrants were employed on significantly different terms to local workers. Mr Miliband said that, rather than the ‘false promises’ to bring down net immigration offered by the Conservatives or Ukip's ‘false solution’ of quitting the EU, Labour will seek to offer ‘clear, credible and concrete solutions which help build a country that works for you’. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said she did not sign off the leaked document. Ms Cooper told Radio 4's The World At One: ‘I'm afraid the document was wrong on this and it doesn't reflect what we are actually doing. ‘What Ed is talking about today is making a pledge on immigration the second pledge that we are setting out for our manifesto for the campaign for the general election, because we know that the three things that people have most concerns about are around the economy, around immigration and around our National Health Service. ‘I'm not taking it too seriously and I don't think you should take this document too seriously because it doesn't reflect what we are actually doing.’ Labour MP Simon Danczuk said he was ‘concerned’ about the document, telling The World At One: ‘I meet people on the doorstep and they talk about the NHS being under strain from immigration, they talk about housing and the pressure from immigration. In this part of the world, when people talk about crime, they sometimes mention trafficking, grooming gangs, sham marriages. This is the reality of it. ‘So you can't really shine a lot on your other policies without talking about immigration as well.’ Last night a poll revealed strong public support for dramatic curbs on EU migrant numbers. Six out of ten people said they wanted a cap on the number of European nationals able to enter the UK. The poll also found opinion on the EU appears to have become significantly more hostile, with 42 per cent wanting to leave compared to 31 per cent in favour of staying in. Tory MP Julian Smith criticised Mr Miliband's seven minute address. He said: 'While it’s true to say that Ed Miliband is all talk and no action – on some of the most important issues facing this country, clearly he prefers not to talk at all. 'Last week Ed gave us a speech on the deficit when he refused to be drawn on spending cuts. Today he’s offered a paltry 7mins 47 seconds on immigration. 'Yet again this reinforces that Ed Miliband is a weak leader with no grip over immigration and no long-term economic plan, putting the security of British people and their families at risk.'","Ed Miliband attacked company bosses who exploit migrant workers .
If he wins election, he will propose making it a criminal offence .

"It was the pit bull versus the pineapple but it appears the  tropical fruit is too much of a prickly customer for this pooch. Quite what petrified Stella the dog is unknown, but owner Jolene Creighton who posted the footage on YouTube said her pet, which is a cross breed mix, gets 'spooked by strange things.' 'I think she's just a bit skittish,' said Creighton, from Hattiesburgh, Mississippi, adding her dog is 'timid around random objects, like balloons.' Peeved pit bull Stella eyes her enemy as the spiky tropical fruit sits on the counter. Her owner Jolene Creighton said she found the dog wandering the streets near her home in Hattiesburgh, Mississippi and that she isn't familiar with day to day stuff . In the hope of showing the cowardly canine that the fruit was harmless Creighton placed the pineapple on the floor, but Stella continued to bark at it. Her other dog eventually showed Stella that the fruit was harmless . The 62 second clip shows Stella barking at the fruit which is placed on the sideboard above her. As Creighton tries to show her that it is nothing to be scared of by placing it on the floor, the petrified pit bull backs off. 'Stella trusts me and I trust her,' wrote Creighton. 'I turned the camera off when it was clear that she was not going to approach the pineapple on her own. 'Then I called my other dog over and showed her that it was okay,' she added. 'I wasn't thrusting the pineapple at her or chasing after her with it. I am not that horrible or awful. 'I really don't want to train my dog to attack everything that she is scared of. I mean, if she viciously mauled the pineapple, then I wouldn't get a tasty fruit snack. And that would be sad.' After Stella became a YouTube hit, Creighton showed the footage to her bemused dog, who appeared less than impressed with the outcome . She added that Stella and the fruit had 'made friends.' After the video went viral on the internet, Creighton showed it to Stella and tweeted a picture of the result. Needless to say, her pooch was less than impressed. 'There will be murderings,' Creighton joked about her bemused pooch.","Stella the pit bull mix barked madly at the spiky tropical fruit .

"Nabeela Khan accepted the blame for driving 40mph through a 30mph zone in the Addison Lee taxi used by her husband Shazad Naz (pictured outside court) A law student who took speeding penalty points for her taxi driver husband has today avoided jail. Nabeela Khan, 37, accepted the blame and paid a fine for driving 40mph through a 30mph zone in the Addison Lee taxi used by Shazad Naz, 38. The couple, both of Tomswood Hill, Ilford, were caught out when police were tipped off that Naz had been on duty at the time. The court heard Naz was caught by a speeding camera near London’s Tower Hill as he took a fare from Covent Garden to Ilford, east London, in the early hours of September 1, 2012. The following month the police received a form back from Naz stating that his wife was the driver. Khan’s licence was endorsed with penalty points and she paid the fine by cheque in February 2013. Prosecutor Dickon Reid said: ‘The police later obtained information from Addison Lee confirming it was Mr Naz who was at work. ‘Khan said in a statement she had been doing her accounts and it came to her that it was not her and it was her partner. ‘She said she had made an honest mistake as she used his minicab to drive around as it was more comfortable than hers.’ Naz and Khan denied perverting the course of justice . Although the couple claimed they made an honest mistake, jurors at the Old Bailey convicted them both of perverting the course of justice. The judge, Mr Recorder Caplan QC, gave the couple suspended prison sentences after accepting it was a ‘spontaneous act’. Khan and her husband claimed they made a mistake but jurors at the Old Bailey convicted them both . He said: ‘I am sure you never expected to find yourselves on trial in court one at the Old Bailey when you completed the forms in connection with the speeding offence. ‘Quite why you both decided on taking that course when Mr Naz had only three points on his licence remains a mystery. ‘Offences of this kind are rightly regarded as very serious as they undermine the interests of justice.’ The judge told Khan: ‘You have studied hard for a legal career and it is a tragedy this will prevent you, at least for a while, from pursuing that career of your choice.’ Naz was sentenced to eight months suspended for 18 months and Khan to six months suspended for 18 months. The judge also ordered Naz to pay £1,000 towards prosecution costs at a rate of £50 a month.","Nabeela Khan accepted the blame for driving 40mph through a 30mph zone .

"The Syrian army on Monday lost control of two strategic bases in the northwestern province of Idlib to co-ordinated assaults by Al Qaeda and other Islamist groups, a monitoring group said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the Al-Nusra Front, an Al Qaeda affiliate, seized Hamidiyeh and Wadi al-Deif bases in the biggest regime positions of Idlib in tandem with Islamist rebels from Jund al-Aqsa and Ahrar al-Sham. The captures came a day after the groups took over seven government checkpoints in the area. The Al-Nusra Front initially reported a lightning victory in Wadi al-Deif, putting large swathes of Idlib province, which borders Turkey, under jihadist control. A Twitter account run by the Al-Nusra Front in the north-west province said fighters are removing mines from the area after the 'Wadi Deif camp was liberated'. Break time: A picture provided by the anti-government activist group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights shows Jihadi fighters from the Al Qaeda-linked Al-Nusra Front and other rebel factions, rest after clashes with Syrian troops while taking a strategic base in Wadi Deif in the northwestern province of Idlib in Syria . Artillery: In its attack on Wadi al-Deif, the Al-Nusra Front used tanks that it captured last month from the (Western-backed)Syrian Revolutionary Front, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights . Government soldiers: Forces loyal to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad walk in an area north of Aleppo . At least 31 government soldiers and 12 opposition fighters have been killed in clashes since Sunday . Aftermath: Smoke rises from warehouses that forces loyal to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad said belonged to rebel fighters . The takeover was a show of force for the Al Qaeda branch, which in November drove mainstream rebels seeking President Bashar al-Assad's ouster from Idlib province. Mainstream opposition fighters had been fighting for Wadi al-Deif and Hamidiyeh for around two years, but despite repeated attempts failed to capture it from government troops. 'The jihadists' advance has major symbolic importance, and it also shows the rebels that Al-Nusra Front really is in control of the area,' said Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman. In its attack on Wadi al-Deif, 'Al-Nusra Front used tanks and other heavy weapons that it captured last month from the (Western-backed) Syrian Revolutionary Front', he told AFP. Location: The takeover was a show of force for the Al Qaeda branch, which in November drove mainstream rebels seeking President Bashar al-Assad's ouster from Idlib province . Al-Nusra's defeat of the SRF was seen as a blow to U.S. efforts to create and train a moderate rebel force as a counterweight to jihadists of the Islamic State group. The Observatory said that at least 31 government soldiers and 12 opposition fighters have been killed in the clashes since Sunday. Within hours of their Wadi al-Deif victory, Al-Nusra and the two other Islamist rebel groups also took over Hamidiyeh, taking 15 soldiers prisoner, said the Observatory. 'Most of the troops have withdrawn to Hamidiyeh,' said Idlib-based activist Asad Kanjo, adding that a major battle appears to be looming over control of that base. An Islamic Front member opens fire during an attack against Assad regime forces in Aleppo, Syria . At least 30 people have been killed in violent clashes as Syrian rebels and the country's army battle over key territory near the city of Aleppo . Ahrar al-Sham had until September tried to distance itself from more hardline jihadists fighting in Syria. But a September 9 blast killed its entire top leadership, and according to Abdel Rahman, 'this pushed the group to align itself more openly with Al-Nusra. Now the two are fighting side by side.' On Monday, Ahrar al-Sham broke its silence on the September explosion and accused 'a criminal group' with 'international links', which Abdel Rahman said was an apparent reference to Western intelligence agencies. Idlib was among the first provinces to fall out of Syrian government hands, soon after the 2011 outbreak of the armed revolt against Assad's rule.

"Rare bitterns are bouncing back with the highest number of 'booming' males recorded since the nineteenth century, wildlife experts said. The elusive heron-like birds, which were driven to extinction in the UK, have been helped by European conservation measures which have supported the restoration and creation of wetland habitat that they rely on, the RSPB said. The bird, prized as a medieval banquet dish and hit by hunting and the loss of its reedbed habitat as wetlands were drained, became extinct in the UK in 1886. The shy, well-camouflaged bitterns are hard to spot, but mating males can be counted from their loud, distinctive boom-like call which carries several miles across marshland .

The latest survey has revealed there were 140 booming males across 61 sites in 2014, up from just 11 males at seven sites in 1997. More than a dozen of the sites where bitterns were counted this year are current or former gravel pits, brick pits or open coal mines where reedbeds have been restored, showing the importance of recreating habitat at quarries and other such spots, the RSPB said. New reedbed habitat for bitterns has also helped other species, ranging from water voles to white egrets and rare small dotted footman moths. The RSPB credits the EU's Life-Nature programme for supporting it and other organisations to recreate wetland habitat. The wildlife charity also said EU protections for birds have helped by requiring the UK Government to take action to boost bittern numbers, designating and ensuring habitat is properly managed for the birds. Funding from the Life-Nature scheme allowed the creation of more than 300 hectares (740 acres) of new reedbed, an area about the size of the City of London. In addition, more than 350 hectares (860 acres) of habitat were restored across 19 sites. The bird, prized as a medieval banquet dish and hit by hunting and the loss of its reedbed habitat as wetlands were drained, became extinct in the UK in 1886 . This year, the highest number of bitterns recorded were at RSPB Ham Wall, inland marsh habitat in Somerset where 20 males were booming. The RSPB said Somerset now had England's largest bittern population. But concerns have been raised that the EU conservation laws which have helped species such as bitterns could be weakened by the new European Commission. Martin Harper, director of conservation at the RSPB, said:' Thanks to protection under European laws and key partners working together, bittern numbers have been gradually climbing since 2000. 'Bitterns needed conservation on a country-wide, landscape scale and without the support of the EU's Birds Directive, which protects all European wild birds and the habitats of listed species like the bittern, this would not have been possible. 'The bittern success story should give hope that it is possible to recover threatened species and that it makes sense to protect the laws that protect nature.' Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss said: 'The bitterns distinctive 'booming' call is just one way in which it is a truly special bird, and I'm delighted that future generations will have a chance to hear it. 'This success is down to the hard work of the conservation organisations, landowners and Government agencies who worked together to improve and create new reedbeds for bitterns to breed in.'","Elusive heron-like birds were driven to extinction in the UK in 1886 .

"Santa Claus did not come to town, or at least he did not make his traditional appearance at one elementary school's winter concert, after he was banned following a complaint. Many parents were outraged after receiving a letter notifying them of the change from the principal of the Andrew Peabody School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, days before the December 12 event. 'Our First through Fourth grade concert as well as our Kindergarten concert will not include a visit from Santa Claus this year,' wrote Jennifer Ford. Scroll down for video . Bah Humbug: Santa Claus was banned from attending the winter concert at the Andrew Peabody School in Cambridge, Massachusetts after a complaint. Parents were outraged after they were notified of the decision in a letter from school principal Jennifer Ford. Many said they did not view Santa as a religious figure . Holding up the letter which informed parents that Santa would not be attending the winter concert is WBZ reporter Katie Brace. The superintendent of the city's schools, Jeffrey Young, defended the decision . Children whose parents did not want them to attend the event which featured songs and performances, could play games and read books with her in the library, she added. Robert Thompson, who has two children at the school, questioned the decision to break with tradition, which he claimed was made after a single complaint. 'I don't think it's right, and I know a lot of people agree with me,' He told the WBZ TV station. 'It seems like that's what's going on in America – the squeaky wheel gets oil. It's a shame.' He added that would not be offended if other cultures were added to the concert. Another, Mohammed Hassan said that the school shouldn't view him as a religious figure. 'It's fun for kids, which is good,' he said. However, the superintendent of the city's schools defended the decision, although he admitted to The Boston Globe newspaper that he had been unaware of Santa's absence. 'Our mission is around education. Santa's not on the top of my list,' said Jeffrey Young, noting that Santa's weren't hard to find at this time of year. 'I just don't know why he has to be in the school,' he added. While principal Ford has yet to comment on Santa's absence, her letter did say Santa would make an appearance at a family sing son on December 23, which parents can opt their children out of. Santa will be making an appearance at the school's Christmas concert on November 23 .","Principal Jennifer Ford told parents about the decision in a letter .

"A mother-of-three who relies on benefits after being forced to give up her job due to cancer claims she can feed her entire family for £30 a week – and still shops at Waitrose and Marks and Spencer. Deanne Wilson, from Headlingley, Leeds, had to leave her £2,000-a-month social care lecturer job after being diagnosed with throat cancer in February and now lives on £221-a-week state benefits. However, despite her income being slashed by more than half, the 43-year-old has refused to let her family's eating habits slip and said: 'Just because I'm on benefits, why should I be feeding my children processed sugar?.' Scroll down for video . Deanne Wilson (pictured with her family), from Headlingley, Leeds, was forced to give up her £2,000-a-month social care lecturer job after being diagnosed with cancer in February and now lives on £221-a-week benefits . She spends just £30 a week on food for her family and buys the majority of her groceries from Waitrose and Marks and Spencer. She buys produce which is heavily-discounted and bulks meals out with vegetables . Ms Wilson continues to shop at high-end supermarkets such as Waitrose and Marks and Spencer, and spends about £50 a month on designer clothes which she picks up from charity shops. She said: 'I can feed my family on £30 a week. They even get extras and treats, but they're not rubbish and not processed. 'I have had no choice, and this was through no fault of my own. 'I go to supermarkets like Waitrose and Marks and Spencer. They reduce some of the good quality food at certain times of the day. 'Just because I'm on benefits, why should I be feeding my children processed sugar?' Ms Wilson receives £221 a week in tax credit, employment support allowance and child benefits but insists it's easy to live off and she still manages to cook fresh, healthy meals every day. Over the last few months she has managed to buy a selection of ten Marks and Spencer sandwiches for £1, a selection of organic Waitrose vegetables for less than £1, lamb steaks reduced to 5p from Asda and an entire grocery shop from Morrisons - that at full price would have cost £80 - for £12. She said she uses the bulk of her budget to buy quality meat, before padding out meals with lots of fresh fruit and vegetables. 'The food is marked down because it's going out of date in a day or so, but because I cook everything fresh every day it makes no difference,' she said. Ms Wilson shops around major supermarkets, including Tesco and Waitrose, for discounts. She mostly buys reduced produce, including M&S vegetables (left) and treats like Tesco olives (centre) and discounted cake . Her bargains include reduced M&S salad (left), cut-price M&S ham (centre) and fresh fruit and vegetables . The mother buys produce in bulk and shops at upmarket chains for end-of-the-day reductions on produce . 'For one meal we might have good quality sausages with mash and lots of veg. All the nice veg, sometimes organic veg, sometimes not. 'I would make a chicken stew with lots of veg and then sometimes I would bake a cake. 'I have given my children the opportunity to know that just because we don't have money, it doesn't mean we can't eat good, proper food.' Though her spending and grocery list changes from week to week depending on what is reduced at which shops, in a standard shop Ms Wilson would buy: . Fruit and veg - £4.50 . Chicken - £4 . Turkey - £4.50 . Sausages - £1.50 . Large bag of rice - £5 . Bread - 50p . Milk - £3.50 . Bottled water - 60p . Juice - 99p . Cheese - £1 . Popcorn - £1 . Total - £27.09 . Ms Wilson has even hit out at those who claim benefits and purposefully choose not to go to work, describing them as 'moaners'. She said: 'People on benefits who can work need to go out to work. Life would be better for them. They need to get off their bums and go out and earn a living. 'People should go out to work and if they have children then they should go out to work once their children reach a certain age. 'I was used to a nice house, where my children didn't really go short of anything. I had the choice of whatever, and could provide for them. 'We went from that to having to survive on benefits which was a nightmare. 'I have never claimed anything before so I didn't know anything about it or what I was entitled to.' She described the treatment she received while trying to sign on for benefits as 'abysmal', and said she puts it down to the amount of people claiming. She said at one point, social services went to her home and checked her fridge, freezer and cupboards for food before she was given a £30 emergency payment so she could feed her children. 'It was absolutely appalling,' she said. 'They even asked my daughter what she was having for dinner to try and catch me out. 'I couldn't speak well and I was tired. I wasn't treated with any kind of sympathy. 'No-one got back to me. I didn't have any money or food for three weeks. 'I think they're just used to people giving them excuses. They're so used to people taking advantage of the system. Ms Wilson buys everything from M&S vegetable mix (left) and salad (right) to meat and fishcakes (centre) She also has bought discounted pasta (left), M&S garlic bread (centre) and Co-operative British pork (right) She managed to pick up this Marks and Spencer ciabatta loaf for just 80p in a reduced section of the store . The 43-year-old has been careful with her budget after her income was halved when she was forced to give up work in February due to throat cancer. Instead of receiving £2,000 a month, she now receives £221 a week . 'The whole system is flawed and people take advantage, but then someone likes me comes along and gets treated abysmally, but it was through no fault of my own.' Despite living on a tight budget, Ms Wilson said she spends £50 a month on designer gear for herself and her five-year-old daughter Amie, and decorates her house with luxury furniture. By shopping for designer labels in charity shops, she said she can indulge her love of quality without the price tag. She has previously bought three dresses, two tops and a skirt for her daughter - all designer - for £30. She dresses her daughter in Kenzo and Armani from charity stores, and some of her other favourite purchases include an Armani Coat bought for £9 and a Gucci Bag bought for £5. 'My daughter and I still manage to wear designer clothing,' she said. 'I call them boutiques but they're actually charity shops. Ms Wilson, 43, also visits charity shops on a weekly basis, spending about £50 a week on designer clothes for herself and her five-year-old daughter . 'I do try to save a little bit but my daughter and I get to wear the most amazing clothes. 'All my dresses are amazing.' Her other secrets to saving money are buying in bulk and bartering with shops for a reduction in prices. She added: 'I barter all the time. There was this table which was solid oak and meant to be £500 but I got it for £100. It's knowing the shops to go to. My bed was £1,000 and I paid £400 for it. 'It works a lot of the time and you've got nothing to lose. They can either say yes or no and they want the sale. I'll also go to Costco and buy things in bulk like washing powder and washing up liquid. It works out a lot cheaper. 'The things I buy just aren't as extravagant.' She also empties the coins from her purse into a jar at the end of the day and uses them to top up petrol, at supermarket self-service machines and to put towards days out for her family to places that charge minimal entry, like historic buildings. She's now determined to keep putting the pennies away every day so she can take her family on holiday. Depending on her health, Ms Wilson, who is also mother to Ben, 19, and Josh, 15, hopes to return to work as soon as possible. She said: 'As it stands now I would like to go back to my teaching job because I have always worked, even when I had the children. 'I love my job and I love the children that I worked with. 'But at the moment I can't lecture for long because my saliva dries up. I get tired and sometimes it's hard to walk long distances. 'I hope my saliva comes back and my energy levels go up. I would like to go to work tomorrow but my body won't let me. 'It's been a learning curve for me. I don't have much choice but I do still have a good standard of living.'","Deanne Wilson lives off benefits after leaving social care job due to cancer .

"Old Bessie can fart up a storm next year and there's nothing the federal government can do about it, judging from a line in the $1.1 trillion federal budget soon to land on President Obama's desk. The idea of tying the hands of the Environmental Protection Agency, which has long planned to count livestock methane 'emissions' as greenhouse gases for regulatory purposes, is just one of the legislative oddities – known in Washington, D.C. as 'riders' – that made the final cut. Congress also tut-tutted the Department of Justice, siding with state laws legalizing medical marijuana and telling the feds they can't spend a dime to enforce an overriding national prohibition. And first lady Michelle Obama's vision of a healthier school lunch program took a hit, with the new law halting efforts to cut sodium levels in foods approved for lunch-lady distribution. SILENT BUT DEADLY? The federal government wants to regulate cow flatulence on global-warming grounds but farmers have won this round . LOW-SODIUM: School lunch standards won't include a salt ceiling next year, despite first lady Michelle Obama's pledge to fight for every inch of ground on nutrition standards . That move, backed by both food companies and school foodservice officials, will short-circuit a multi-year salt-cutting process that's already in motion. A representative of a major multinational packaged food company told MailOnline that her employer doesn't want to create a separate production chain just for school-food institutional customers. 'If all our institutional customers – prisons, hospitals, and so forth – wanted low sodium standards, that would be different,' she said, on the condition that her company's name not be mentioned. 'But at some point it becomes cost-prohibitive to be in the business if there are new contract requirements popping up all the time.' Food officials and nutritionists in dozens of major markets have complained in recent years about changes to the federal school lunch program, driven largely by Mrs. Obama, that depressed sales as students opted not to buy anything on the menu. In addition to a clampdown on low-salt rules until more science emerges about any health benefits, they will also get a pass on rules requiring the use of whole-grain breads and pastas if they can show buying the more expensive staples would create a financial hardship. One whole-grain option – pizza – would even take a hit if the Obama administration's sodium goals were put on autopilot, warns the School Nutrition Association. MIXED BAG: Medical pot in DC will be a dead issue in 2015 but the feds won't be able to go after Americans who take advantage of state laws permitting it . 'Naturally occurring sodium present in milk, meats and other foods, make the later sodium targets extremely difficult to achieve,' the organization says in a set of talking points obtained by MailOnline. 'Popular and healthy choices such as low-fat, whole grain cheese pizza, macaroni and cheese and deli sandwiches could be stripped from school menus if manufacturers are unable to develop cheeses that meet these extreme standards.' Getting that cheese to market, along with the rest of what a cow produces, will also be less difficult in 2015 – at least compared with what the EPA had planned. The agency had planned to fight global warming with a rule requiring farmers and ranchers to report how much methane their livestock produce through belching and flatulence. That was expected to increase the cost of bringing animal protein to market when the EPA followed up with a permitting process designed to shrink a cow's carbon footprint. But no more. Ranchers and environmentalists have fought a pitched battle over climate change rules since 2009 when a United Nations report, 'Livestock's Long Shadow,' claimed that farm animals were responsible globally for a whopping 18 per cent of all greenhouse gases. But in America, the EPA's own numbers showed months earlier that all of agriculture put together only contributed 6 per cent of the U.S. total – and livestock agriculture's portion came to just 2.6 per cent. In another sector of American agriculture, the burgeoning marijuana cultivation industry, Congress delivered a mixed bag over the weekend. The Department of Justice will be forbidden in 2015 from spending any funds to enforce federal pot laws against people taking advantage of state laws that permit the medicinal use of the drug. But although a 65-percent majority of Washington, D.C. voters chose to create a medical marijuana program last month, that idea will die on the vine. The federal budget bill forbids spending money 'to enact or carry out any law, rule, or regulation to legalize or otherwise reduce penalties associated with the possession, use, or distribution' of marijuana or anything made from it.","11th hour sleight-of-hand will prohibit the EPA from penalizing farmers for methane gas emitted by cows .
The feds will be prohibited from going after Americans who benefit from state-level medical marijuana laws, even though pot is still illegal federally .
School lunches will be safe from the salt police, with Congress clamping down on efforts to bland-i-fy mystery meat and vegetable medleys .
A host of other 'riders' were slipped into the 'CRomnibus' bill that had members of Congress scrambling to avoid a government shutdown ."
"Alexander Jentzsch, the 27-year-old son of Scientology president Heber Jentzsch, died last week after complaining of a fever the night before, leaving his grieving mother, Karen de la Carriere, without any closure. For Ms de la Carriere left the Church some two years ago, and because of her decision, she said her son was forced to disconnect from her - an act which she has labelled 'savage.' Ms de la Carriere revealed to MailOnline the tragic life of her only child, saying: ‘For two years, he was gone from my life, and a few weeks ago his life fell apart…and now he’s dead.' She described how her son's wife was allegedly pressured to have an abortion, triggering a downward spiral that ended with his death last week. Permission denied: Ms de la Carriere said there was no funeral and that she was not permitted to see Alexander, pictured in this undated photo . Ms de la Carriere, who is the premiere collector for recently passed contemporary artist Thomas Kinkade, said in an emotional interview that she tried in vain to visit her son’s body at the Los Angeles County Morgue. But even that was impossible, because . she was excommunicated by the Church of Scientology and deemed an SP – a . suppressive person. A mother's grief: Karen de la Carriere said her son disowned in 2010 after she left Scientology . She wept as she said: ‘I put in 35 years, I lived on rice and beans, the discipline and the savagery…there’s no mercy, there’s no benevolence. The Church of Scientology has no charity.’ She said that her son’s last months were troubled. He had been living with his wife Andrea in Dallas, where both worked for Sea Org. Sometime within the span of two years when Alexander shunned his mother, he had been in a bad car accident and injured his back. The accident required him to take prescription pain medication. Ms de la Carriere said she only found out because of her son’s autopsy. She said: ‘I was never told and he could never tell me because I’m shunned.' Financially struggling and recently separated from his wife, Alexander moved back to Los Angeles and moved in with his in-laws, continuing to take painkillers. Ms de la Carriere said it was leaked to her that her son had a breathing problem. Rather than take Alexander to a doctor, she said that his in-laws performed a touch-assist on him. ‘A touch-assist is for bruised knees,’ Ms de la Carriere said, ‘breathing difficulty is medicine.' Alexander’s father-in-law discovered him unresponsive around 8am Tuesday morning. Missing? President of the Church of Scientology International Heber Jentzsch has not been seen publically since 2004; their son Alexander, who was 27, died July 2nd . Incarcerated: Heber's ex-wife Karen de la Carriere says that the president, who is now 76, is being kept against his will in the S.P. Hole without access to the internet or a cell phone . A spokesman for the Los Angeles County Coroner’s Office said that he was found with multiple prescription medications, as well as NyQuil. She said there were clues that her son’s life was crumbling, though she hadn’t seen or heard from him in two years. ‘I know as a mom how much his life was falling apart,’ the art collector said. 'He had no job, he had no father, he had no mom, his wife and him were separated. He had a back injury that required drugs. This is the kind of destruction that comes with the shunning policy.’ She added: 'He always called himself ""the boy with no dad.""' Alexander, she said, grew up without seeing Herber. Ms de la Carrier explained: ‘Alexander’s chip on his shoulder was he never saw his father. In 16 years, he may have seen his father 9 times. 'His father didn’t call for Christmas, he couldn’t call to wish him happy birthday. Alexander had a huge sadness, and would say ""My father doesn’t love me,"" but he didn’t understand that he is in prison.' ''Alexander’s chip on his shoulder was he . never saw his father.

Alexander had a huge sadness, and would say ‘My father . doesn’t love me,’ but he didn’t understand that he is in prison.' Heber Jentzsch has not been seen in public for nearly a decade, one of several high-profile Scientology members removed from the public eye. The wife of church leader David Miscavige, Michelle 'Shelly' Barnett, has not been seen since 2007. She said that this is a ‘deeply embarrassing’ situation for the Church. She said: ‘Let me explain the why: The church of Scientology is a self-protection mechanism. The church must survive because they think they are the greatest good for the greatest number. Therefore, anything you do to anyone is fair game. 'You can destroy an enemy, you can cheat them, you can steal. This is fair game policy.’ In the end, she said she is not looking to gain anything. ‘I just wanted to look at my son’s body for fifteen seconds before he was cremated,’ the mother said. She said that she has a short-term tactical attack, of which she would say no more. But for the long term? ‘On the longer range,’ she said, ‘I will continue to whistle-blow and I will continue to shed light. I was in for 35 years. I will try to right a wrong, but my motivation is truly not revenge because I didn’t see my dead son’s body. My motivation is – this has to stop, we have to create change. And even if it stops people giving them more money, it turns people off so they don’t want to contribute, then that is forward progress.’ Happier times: Left, Karen and Heber on their wedding day and right, Heber and their young son Alexander . In an explosive tell-all published on . a friend’s blog in 2010, Ms de la Carriere revealed her struggle with . the religion, and explained how Alexander, who was born in 1984, was . inculcated with the beliefs of Scientology from infancy. According to . her, Alexander was a member of Sea Org for more than a decade. She . also wrote of the policies surrounding Scientology and reproduction. Alexander’s wife, Andrea, became pregnant in 2007. She wrote in the . post: ‘Pressure is brought to bear for an abortion. It is done skilfully . – no heavy threats, but both are taken off post to look at ""the . greatest good…"" In the end, Andrea had an abortion and they were . returned to post.' Ms de la . Carriere said in a 2011 interview that she and then-husband Heber had . to petition for a second child, a newly-ordained rule at the time. Rewarding: Ms de la Carriere said: 'Heber (far right) would give out awards to people who donated megabucks to the Church' She . said she wanted a girl. ‘A new [rule] had come out that you had to petition to . have a baby,' she explained. 'And along with the petition, you were to . name why you should be allowed to have a baby.’ Ms . de la Carriere said that though she and her husband petitioned for . three months, their petition was denied. She also said that her husband . was beaten for making the request. She again became pregnant three years later. A . spokesperson from the Church of Scientology International told . MailOnline: ‘Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with Heber Jentzsch . and his entire family during this difficult time. ‘The . Church takes offense at the irresponsible and false claims from . excommunicated self-promoters who are sadly exploiting private family . matters for their own personal financial gain.’ Ms . de la Carriere told the Village Voice: ‘The dead body of the son of the . president of the Church of Scientology has been sitting in a morgue for . days, and they didn’t tell me because I’m a declared SP.’ Leaving: Karen, back right, left the Church of Scientology in 2010 and said her son cut all ties with her . She told RadarOnline.com that Alexander’s wife, Andrea, refuses to let her see her son’s body. When . Ms de la Carriere sent a friend over to their home with a letter for . Andrea, the friend was turned away with the message, ‘All communication . goes through the Office of Special Affairs.’ The . mother told the Village Voice that the Church created a ‘hate website’ about her, and coerced Alexander to cut all ties with her. She said that he was spoon fed what to tell her, including the words: ‘Never phone me, never e-mail me. Until you get your s*** together, we can have no communication.  'Until then, we are disconnected.’ The mother added: ‘For two years, he disconnected from me, and now he’s dead.’ She found out three days after the fact that her son had died from former Scientology spokesman Mike Rinder.  Apparently, Andrea had told some of her Scientology friends on Facebook about Alexander’s death, and the news eventually tricked down to Rinder, who currently lives in Florida, RadarOnline.com reported. Once told by Mr Rinder, Ms de la Carriere called the coroner’s office, which solidly confirmed her son’s death. Hollywood split: The religion has again come into the spotlight after supposedly playing a central role in the divorce of Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise, pictured . The religion has again come into the spotlight after supposedly playing a central role in the divorce of Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise. In light of the rumours that Cruise’ devotion to Scientology- and his supposed desire to enroll their daughter Suri in one of the religion’s intense boot camps - was one of the main causes for their split,  two senior Church administrators sent a panicked email giving followers advice on how to counter the negative press storm. The letter comes the day after one of the most noted 'defectors' from the religion predicted that Cruise's latest divorce could be the ‘biggest nightmare in the Church of Scientology’s history’ because of the drama that could unfold if secrets are publicly revealed in court. Scientology was developed by L. Ron Hubbard in 1952.

"Anyone who has read Cheryl Strayed's best-selling book Wild knows that her hiking boots are a central part of the story. And now, following the release of the film interpretation starring Reese Witherspoon, REI has released the Danner Mountain Light Cascade boot, a replica of the author's original footwear, for $299. The shoes, which famously appears on the cover of the 2012 book, come in 'the exact box used in 1995 when Cheryl Strayed set off to hike 1,100 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail.' To be in her shoes: REI is selling the retro Danner Mountain Light Cascade boots worn by Reese Witherspoon's character in Wild (pictured) for $299 . Vintage pair: The footwear comes in 'the exact box used in 1995 when Cheryl Strayed set off to hike 1,100 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail' The new shoes, a tribute to the iconic style originally introduced in the 1970s, were custom-made for Reese to wear in the movie. In the memoir, Cheryl suffers through several weeks and hundreds of miles of trekking while wearing a pair of boots that are a size too small. So she is understandably ecstatic when, halfway through her journey, the company sends her a new pair for free thanks to a 100per cent customer satisfaction guarantee. Even though Cheryl - and in turn, Reese Witherspoon - mentions the brand and model of the shoes multiple times throughout the story, REI reportedly did not pay for the mention. But to celebrate the launch of the film, Danner has released a replica of Cheryl's rugged brown hiking boots at select stores. Iconic: The author's well-worn hiking boots famously appear on the cover of the book . According to the Danner website, the boots are 'a tribute to one of Danner's iconic hiking styles introduced in the early 1970's - a style believed by many to be the greatest backpacking boot of all time'. Just like Cheryl's pair, the shoes feature retro red laces. They also come with sew-on Pacific Crest Trail mile marker patches. Wild the movie, which was released in the U.S. on December 5th, has received much critical acclaim. On Monday, it was revealed that Reese Witherspoon was nominated for best actress at the upcoming Critics' Choice Movie Awards for her role as Cheryl Strayed. Reese will be competing against Jennifer Aniston (Cake), Marion Cotillard (Two Days, One Night), Felicity Jones (The Theory of Everything), Julianne Moore (Still Alice), and Gone Girl's Rosamund Pike for the award. The star took to Twitter after receiving the happy news, writing, 'Thank you!!!' and retweeting the Critics' Choice mention. In Wild, Reese tells the true story of Cheryl Strayed's autobiographical accounts as she trekked the Pacific Crest Trail, which is estimated to be approximately 1,100 miles long. Also starring in the critically favored motion picture are actors Laura Dern and Michiel Huisman.","In the new film, Reese Witherspoon plays author Cheryl Strayed, who wrote 2012 book Wild about trekking California's Pacific Crest Trail ."

Kathryn Reeve, prosecuting, said: 'The defendant was very upset she was with another male so soon after him. 'The defendant jumped on Mr Lawlor and was punching him.' Mr Lawlor was on his first tour of duty  in Helmand Province when an IED exploded . Scarborough Magistrates' Court heard Miss Woodcock, who was naked at the time, jumped on Pattison's back and tried to drag him away as Mr Lawlor tried to get to his legs, which he had left downstairs. In the course of the tussle Miss Woodcock was thrown down the stairs and suffered cuts and bruises. Pattison then began smashing up the house, before running away when Miss Woodcock  called police. Mr Lawlor did not suffer any serious injuries. On Friday Pattison pleaded guilty to assault and criminal damage. Sentencing was adjourned until January 9 and Pattison was given conditional bail - he cannot have any contact with his ex or Mr Lawlor. Mr Lawlor said: 'It was just a domestic incident I got caught in.' He had been on his first tour of duty  in Helmand Province when a concealed device exploded under his feet. At Camp Bastion's field hospital he was given lifesaving surgery before being flown back to Birmingham's Selly Oak Hospital.

"Ronald Cooke, 67, sold hundreds of vintage and modern police uniforms to film studios and TV companies including  the BBC and ITV . A police uniform trader who sold helmets and truncheons to the BBC, ITV and prestigious theatres has been prosecuted after being unable to prove they were not being bought by potential terrorists. Ronald Cooke, 67, provided hundreds of vintage and modern police uniforms for film studios and even sold helmets to the National Theatre in London for a number of productions. The trader from Bordon, Hampshire, was found guilty on eight counts of illegally possessing items of police clothing under the Police Act 1996 and was fined £250 at Bournemouth Crown Court. His appeal was quashed last week after a judge ruled he had not properly vetted the people he sold the items to and he was ordered to pay a further £300. Police raided his home last year and seized 236 helmets, 56 baseball caps and 92 helmet badges worth more than £10,000. Mr Cooke's solicitor Harvey Whittacombe warned that this landmark case could open the floodgates for similar prosecutions against theatres and TV shows like Heartbeat. Speaking after his conviction, Mr Cooke said he was 'incredibly frustrated' because he supplied the uniforms to the entertainment industry rather than potential criminals. 'Their argument was that I didn't know who I was selling to but I did know. I sell mostly to theatres and film and TV companies,' he said. 'For example, we sold helmets to the National Theatre of Holland for their production of Billy Elliot because they wanted policeman from the miners' strike in the 1980s. 'I also sold some tunics and helmets to the set of a film featuring Michael Caine, as well as to the BBC and ITV and the National Theatre in London. 'Of course I sell to individuals but I always talk to them and I know what they want them for. 'Most of the stock was historic, a lot of it dating back to the 1970s and relating to now-defunct police forces like the Royal Parks Police. 'I trade in a lot of cap badges which are mostly silver and not enamel like the ones used today. 'But now I have been convicted it is case law and I suppose other traders are liable for prosecution.' 'Anybody who has got a police uniform that has not been authorised by the police could be prosecuted.' Mr Cooke's solicitor Harvey Whittacombe warned that this landmark case could open the floodgates for similar prosecutions against theatres and TV shows like Heartbeat (pictured) Mr Cooke revealed he had sold to most of the theatres in Britain including the National Theatre in London . He sourced the products from eBay, the National Museum of Policing and a specialist wholesale firm and sold them for use as props and to known collectors in the US. Mr Cooke sold the items online and from his shop Dorset Militaria in Penn Court, West Moors, which closed down in August. Kevin Hill, representing Cooke at the appeal hearing, tried to argue that his client did not have a responsibility to monitor his buyers and that the Police Act was aimed at people caught in possession of police equipment in suspicious circumstances. He said: 'Did he intend to do something with these items that was illegal? As he clearly stated at interview, he did not.' But a judge ruled that he had not taken adequate steps to ensure his buyers were reputable. Judge James Meston QC said the Act was intended 'for the protection of the public' and 'the maintenance of the integrity of the police service'. He said the nature of Cooke's business was such that he could not and that he had not taken steps to warn his customers of their legal obligations. Mr Cooke said he is now planning to take the matter to the High Court as long as he could secure the funding. His solicitor Mr Whittacombe said: 'Anybody who has got a police uniform that has not been authorised by the police could be prosecuted. 'All sorts of people have police uniforms for the purposes of fooling members of the public. 'When you watch Heartbeat there are people in uniforms designed to fool the watching public. 'Many of the items that Mr Cooke had came from museums and other items came from various websites like eBay. 'If he is guilty then it stands to reason that all these other people must be guilty as well. 'We are surprised that the police haven't yet gone after these people, it doesn't make sense. If he is doing wrong than the others must be doing the same thing. 'The CPS suggested certain people are authorised to have uniforms but we cannot find any law or act where you get that authorisation. 'It seems the CPS went after Mr Cooke to try and a test case. 'Of course they are worried about people impersonating police officers but there are separate laws that deal with that. 'There is no case law for this so Mr Cooke's case is a first.'","Ronald Cooke, 67, sold police uniforms to the BBC, ITV and British theatres .

"Ed Miliband last night claimed he had never seen the ‘disastrous’ leaked Labour document advising MPs not to campaign on immigration. The Labour leader said he had ‘no idea’ who was responsible for the 33-page paper, which suggested ‘moving the conversation on’ to issues such as pressures on the NHS and housing when voters raise it. But he risked more criticism when what had been billed as a major pre-election speech on Labour policy on immigration – which he forgot to mention in his party conference speech – lasted for less than seven minutes. Scroll down for video . 'No idea': Ed Miliband said he did not know who wrote a paper advising MPs not to mention immigration . The document, entitled Campaigning Against Ukip, highlighted changes in Labour’s immigration policy since 2010. It advised MPs not to send out campaign leaflets about immigration to all voters because it could prove ‘unhelpful’. Party insiders blamed Lucy Powell, Mr Miliband’s new election campaign chief, for allowing an internal strategy document to be issued to MPs most at risk from Ukip without it being checked by senior colleagues. The paper said immigration was the issue ‘people most often cite’ when explaining why they back Nigel Farage’s party. It advised campaigners to ‘understand and acknowledge’ concerns even if they ‘may not gel with their own’. But it insisted Labour cannot win a ‘bidding war’ with Ukip, adding: ‘Our focus must instead be moving the conversation on to issues where we have clear policy which tackles the problems people are worried about.’ Blame: Party insiders put the blame for not seeking full approval at the door of Lucy Powell (above) Senior MPs were furious about the document, which had not been seen by shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper. One said it was ‘disastrous’ and blamed Miss Powell, put in charge of the day-to-day running of Labour’s election campaign despite being elected only in 2012. Asked if he had seen the document before it was issued to MPs, Mr Miliband said: ‘No. I have no idea who oversaw the document. ‘There were bits that obviously weren’t well-drafted.’ In his less than seven-minute speech in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, the Labour leader said that if elected he would change the law to prevent firms exploiting legal loopholes to employ foreign workers on lower wages than their British counterparts. ‘It isn’t prejudiced to worry about immigration, it is understandable,’ he added. He later told ITV News that Labour candidates should not shy away from talking about immigration. ‘Absolutely, they should talk to voters about it. Of course you’ve got to engage with people’s concerns,’ he said. ‘We’ve learnt lessons since 2010. I’ve changed Labour’s approach on immigration.’ Gordon Brown’s former spin doctor Damian McBride said Labour’s ‘strategic’ advisers should be beaten ‘savagely around the head’ with a rolled-up copy of the 33-page paper. He said that such documents should not be ‘done by people who don’t have the sheer bloody common sense to realise how their words will sound if exposed publicly’. Labour MP Simon Danczuk, a critic of the leadership, said: ‘This leaked document on how Labour should try to win back Ukip voters shows lessons are still to be learned.’ But former Labour leadership contender Diane Abbott complained that the party was giving the impression it was ‘running scared of Ukip’. She added: ‘Labour cannot magic immigrants off the streets without pulling out of the international conventions that commit us to accepting refugees and asylum seekers, or somehow nullifying the citizenship of existing UK passport holders.’ JAMES SLACK'S ANALYSIS: Weasel words that reveal what Labour REALLY thinks . Ed Miliband yesterday claimed voters should be in ‘no doubt’ about how seriously Labour treats concerns over mass immigration. However a document sent to MPs and activists reveals that, in reality, the party would rather talk about almost anything else. Here, Home Affairs Editor JAMES SLACK examines the key paragraphs. What the document says: Immigration is the issue people most often cite when explaining support for Ukip, either their own or that of communities and electors more generally ... It does not however follow that campaigning on immigration issues and emphasising our policies in our conversations with electors is always the correct response. Translation: Labour – for all the recent talk of crackdowns – continues to support large-scale immigration, particularly from within the EU. Party chiefs know that, as a result, they cannot win a bidding war with Ukip so should, wherever possible, avoid the subject altogether – or risk losing seats. Fightback: Ed Miliband took questions on immigration in a seven-minute speech in Great Yarmouth yesterday . What it says: Writing to electors proactively (i.e. without evidence the elector is concerned about it) about immigration risks undermining the broad coalition of support we need to return to government. Translation: Don’t prompt voters to think about immigration if they are not already doing so. Leave the topic out of general mailshots. Some Labour voters are supporters of mass immigration. Why upset them with talk of tough new measures needed to win back potential defectors to Ukip? What it says: Following from this, when we embark on policy messaging around immigration, which is not an area where Labour has the strongest lead over other parties, we should ensure that this messaging is always done in conjunction with other policy areas. The purpose of this is to raise the salience of those issues in which Labour has a much clearer lead and stands to benefit more from their prominence with the electorate.’ Translation: If immigration does come up, change the topic as quickly as possible. If a voter talks about the pressure on the NHS or education, switch the focus to health care and schools more generally. Get on comfortable territory. What it says: Volunteers and activists must understand and acknowledge electors’ concerns about immigration on the doorstep, which will mean hearing opinions that may not gel with their own. In these cases, it’s important to remember that first phase of re-establishing trust is to listen and understand. Translation: A weasel-worded way of saying that, while Labour activists will not agree with some people’s desire for stricter border controls, they must try not to sneer, and at least humour them. An insight into the way the modern Labour party feels it may have to condescend to views it finds unpalatable. What it says: Ukip’s electoral success has come from disenfranchised backers of all three main parties including ‘former Labour supporters who feel that the party has left them behind in pursuit of better-educated, middle-class, white collar voters’. Translation: During the New Labour years, the party entirely neglected the concerns of ordinary voters, especially over immigration. Now those chickens are coming home to roost and the party has to try to do something about it. The Heywood and Middleton by-election, where Ukip came within 617 votes of snatching the seat, is proof of that.","Anti-Ukip strategy paper said MPs should 'move the conversation on'

"Labour spending plans will mean tax rises for millions of families, David Cameron claimed today. In a speech on the economy, the Prime Minister said the Ed Miliband's decision not to support Tory spending cuts left voters with a clear choice at the next election - more Government spending under Labour, but also higher taxes. Mr Cameron said: 'If people are happy to be taxed more, fine. They can make their decision at the next election. But that is the consequence of Labour – and the British people need to know it.' Scroll down for video . Prime Minister David Cameron, who will claim today that Labour's economic plan is a 'massive gamble' that would leave Britain vulnerable to a repeat of the 2008 crisis . Last week, Mr Miliband sought last week to win back trust in Labour's ability to handle the nation's finances by setting out a 'tough and balanced' approach which would eliminate the current deficit 'as soon as possible'. He said 2015 would be 'a fight for the soul of our country', between Conservatives bent on slashing public spending to 1930s levels for ideological reasons and a Labour Party offering a 'tough and balanced' approach which would eliminate the current deficit 'as soon as possible'. Mr Miliband insisted a Labour government would  only borrow to invest in such things as infrastructure. But Mr Cameron will warn that this will prevent the eradication of the £91billion budget deficit and mean higher taxes for all. He said: 'When they say, as they do, that they don’t support our spending reductions, that they want to spend more - we all know what that means: higher taxes. 'There is simply no way around this. The money’s got to come from somewhere – and it’s going to come from you. 'So that is the choice between sticking to the plan or veering off it: lower taxes or higher taxes.' He also warned there would be deeper cuts in the future to pay off the debts in the long term . Mr Cameron pointed to analysis by the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies that says the plans would let Mr Miliband borrow up to £50billion a year. The Tories have pledged to run a £23billion budget surplus by the end of the next parliament, letting ministers begin paying off the national debt. Mr Cameron said that beneath the 'jargon' was a blueprint that would massively increase public borrowing and store up potential crises. He said Labour's plans would involve increasing the Government's towering debts 'for ever' - leaving Britain vulnerable to a repeat of the 2008 crisis. Left unchecked, Labour's plans will increase the national debt by £500billion in two decades - equal to almost £30,000 for every tax-paying family - Mr Cameron added. Ed Miliband said 2015 was 'a fight for the soul of our country' - between the Tories bent on slashing spending for ideological reasons and Labour which would eliminate the current deficit 'as soon as possible' 'At the height of the so-called boom years, far from running a surplus, Britain was running the biggest structural deficit in the G7. Then, in 2008, when the economic storms hit, we were completely exposed,' he warned. 'Our plan is about making sure that doesn't happen again. It's about saying that by 2018 we will be putting money aside so that if any crash or shock happens to our economy, we will be better prepared. 'And frankly, if we are not going to start putting money aside after seven years of continued economic growth, when will we be?' Experts have warned that the scale of the squeeze required to meet the Chancellor's targets would mean spending cuts 'on a colossal scale'. George Osborne wants Britain to run a £23billion budget surplus by the end of the next parliament . Liberal Democrat cabinet minister Vince Cable said they would 'destroy public services in this country in the way we know them' and accused the Tories of embarking on an extreme 'ideological' mission that would spell misery for voters. But Mr Cameron insisted the Tory plans are 'sensible and reasonable' compared to the 'reckless' Labour strategy. 'Ed Miliband spoke about the deficit - and wrapped it all up in a lot of jargon. 'He claimed he would run 'a surplus on the current budget' and attacked our plans to 'balance the overall budget'. I want to peel back the jargon and tell you what this actually means. 'Ed Miliband is saying he will only balance part of the Government's budget, not the whole thing like we plan. 'And let's be clear what that means: Ed Miliband would never clear the overall, headline budget deficit. He would run a budget deficit, permanently adding to debt indefinitely. Every year. Forever.' Treasury calculations suggested Labour's policy would result over 21 years in a £500 billion bigger debt than on Tory plans, he will say, £30,000 more debt for every taxpaying household in Britain. 'That is a great, black, ominous cloud on the horizon and if a real economic storm hit again, the fall-out would be felt by families up and down this country... 'Our plan is about fixing the roof when the sun is shining. The alternative is about taking a massive gamble with our future.' Labour questioned why the Chancellor had not - as promised in the Autumn Statement - yet set out details of legislation enshrining in law a commitment to eliminate the deficit on day-to-day spending by Government departments by 2017-18. The move was seen as a trap for Labour but shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Chris Leslie said it was now 'a shambles'. 'In the Budget George Osborne was talking about a vote on balancing the overall budget. Then last month the Treasury tried to lay the ground for a big U-turn by briefing that the vote would only be on balancing the current budget, excluding capital investment. 'And now, after all the hype and promises that a new Charter would have been published over the last week, the Government has totally failed to publish anything. This is a total mess. As ever, these so-called Tory traps are backfiring on the Chancellor. 'George Osborne should spend less time playing silly political games and more time sorting out the economy and trying to make his sums add up.'","PM warns Ed Miliband will leave the UK vulnerable to a repeat of 2008 crisis .

"A long-running dispute between neighbours over two inches of land boiled over in bizarre fashion when one was caught on camera ripping down a set of iron railings. Ex-Lib Dem councillor Richard Oglethorpe was filmed pulling down the fencing put up by the elderly couple next door before smashing what was left with a hammer. John and Susan Newton, who run an engineering business, said yesterday it was the culmination of a seven-year feud that began when they built a side entrance to improve access to their home. Scroll down for video . This is the shocking moment former Lib Dem councillor Richard Oglethorpe was caught on camera as he took a hammer to the iron fencing put up by neighbours following a row with over just two inches of land . John and Sue Newton, from Aigburth, were 'shocked' when neighbour Mr Oglethorpe ripped down the railings . They said Mr Oglethorpe’s actions – which led to police being called – made them even more determined to stand their ground. The couple, who are replacing the fence, claimed the 53-year-old was a ‘bully’. ‘Once he got going with the railing there was just no stopping him,’ said Mrs Newton, 58. ‘He’s an absolute nightmare. He just bullies us and he’s even got a file on me with everything written down and photos. ‘We’ve had to do the same and that’s why we have CCTV cameras. But we won’t be moving. All I want is just to get on with my life.’ The dispute, on a quiet street in Aigburth, south Liverpool, escalated into a blazing row between Mr Oglethorpe and 81-year-old Mr Newton last Friday. Former Cressington ward councillor Richard Oglethorpe was caught on camera pulling down the fence  after a blazing row with his neghbours . The former Liverpool council cabinet member for the environment was having his driveway resurfaced, and tempers flared over the fence, which he is understood to believe is fractionally on his property. As his stunned neighbours stood by, the father of two pulled down the wrought-iron fence with his bare hands before smashing its foundations with a hammer. By the time police arrived, there was nothing but a tangled jumble of metal on Mr Oglethorpe’s drive. Mrs Newton claimed her husband, who suffers from a heart condition, had been driven to despair. But she vowed that the family would not be run out of the house where they have lived for 36 years. ‘He won’t speak to us and he just ignores letters from our architects and surveyors,’ she said. ‘If we are in the wrong then so be it, but I don’t want to go the court and pay a load of money just to show a legal document. I think he does, just so he can laugh at us.’ The couple say problems began in 2007 when they tried to build a pitched roof and then a side entrance to help Mr Newton get easier access to the house. They claim Mr Oglethorpe halted the plan because the gutter would overhang his property by one inch. They say he built an archway which encroached on to their land. After the council refused to intervene they hit back by erecting the fence while he was on holiday in July. ‘I have tried everything to be neighbourly with him,’ Mrs Newton said. ‘But no one on the street likes him. They all think he’s a bully. My biggest fear is what he will do if we give him this piece of land.’ Mr Oglethorpe refused to comment. A Merseyside Police spokesman said: ‘After officers arrived and spoke to both parties, it became clear that it was a civil matter so officers offered advice at the scene. There is no more police involvement in the matter.’ The video shows while Mrs Newton was talking to workmen, the livid councillor used a hammer and brought the railing crashing to the ground - even though it had been in place between the houses since July . Shocked Mrs Newton said  the former councillor is a 'bully' - but says she and her husband are going nowhere .

"British pupils lag behind their counterparts in the Far East because they spend considerably less time doing homework, a new analysis suggests. International research spanning 65 countries shows a clear link between time spent on homework and higher academic performance. Teenagers who put in the most homework hours tended to do better in an international maths test, according to the study, which is one of the biggest ever carried out into homework patterns. British pupils lag behind their counterparts in the Far East because they spend considerably less time doing homework, a new analysis suggests . It also revealed that British 15-year-olds complete a fraction of the homework of peers in East Asian nations which regularly take top spots in international maths rankings. British teenagers spend 4.9 hours a week doing homework – substantially less than the 13.8 clocked up by counterparts in Shanghai, China. The city, the biggest in China, came first in last year’s international table of teenagers’ maths performance in 65 countries and regions produced by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which also carried out the homework study. In Singapore, which came second in the table, average homework hours are 9.4, while in Hong Kong, which came third, pupils put in six hours. Britain – whose homework hours are the same as the international average - came an undistinguished 26th in the table, which is based on results in the so-called PISA test (Programme for International Student Assessment), given to 15-year-olds in participating countries every three years. The study also found that Britain has one of the highest totals of pupils who do no homework at all. Teenagers in Shanghai, China, came top of the OECD's list - clocking up 13.8 hours of homework every week . And the country has one of the largest gaps between pupils from middle-class and disadvantaged backgrounds in the amount of homework time clocked up. The OECD concluded that spending more time on homework could influence the results of individual pupils and schools. The benefit to pupils of attending a school which sets lots of homework could equate to six months of schooling, the research suggested. But the OECD was unable to say that adopting more homework as a national policy would drive up a country’s performance in the rankings. It said that other factors – such as the quality of teaching – were likely to be more crucial to the achievement of a country as a whole. The study said: ‘The amount of time students spend doing homework is related to their individual performance in Pisa and to their school’s Pisa performance: students who spend more time doing homework tend to score higher in PISA, as do their schools. But it added: ‘While the amount of homework assigned is associated with mathematics performance among students and schools, other factors are more important in determining the performance of school systems as a whole. ‘The average number of hours that students spend on homework or other study set by teachers tends to be unrelated to the school system’s overall performance. Research showed that other factors, such as the quality of instruction and how schools are organised, have a greater impact on a school system’s overall performance . ‘This implies that other factors, such as the quality of instruction and how schools are organised, have a greater impact on a school system’s overall performance.’ This may explain why Finland, which came 12th in the maths table, sets the lowest level of weekly homework among countries studied, at just 2.8 hours. Experts said, however, the implications for individual pupils were clear. ‘These findings should finally silence sceptics who have argued that homework is bad for youngsters, causing stress and division in families,’ said Professor Alan Smithers, of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at the University of Buckingham. ‘Homework is clearly very important to reinforce lessons that are learnt at school. It is worrying that in this country there are lots of 15-year-olds who are not doing any homework at all,’ he told the Sunday Times. ‘It is a failure of schools if they are not setting and enforcing homework. The best schools set it, mark it and hand it back quickly and make a fuss if it isn’t done.’ He suggested that 15-year-olds should be doing 1.5 hours a night of homework, five nights a week. ‘That gives young people time to size up the problem and put in the effort, check it and then have some time to develop their hobbies later in the evening,’ he said. The research will add to intense debate about the role of homework amid claims by some contributors to parenting website that it should be banned, at least in primary school. Justine Roberts, co-founder of Mumsnet, said she wanted to see schools doing more to lean on pupils to complete their homework instead of expecting parents to police it. ‘If schools are serious about homework parents will support it, but it should not all be left to parents to make it happen. Where parents get really frustrated is where they feel they are battling alone to enforce it,’ she said. The study prompted the OECD to call on schools to offer classrooms where pupils could work after school and help parents motivate children to finish their homework before surfing the web. Andreas Schleicher, OECD education director, said: ‘One good way to make sure that homework doesn’t perpetuate differences in performance that are related to students’ socio-economic status is for schools and teachers to encourage struggling and disadvantaged students to complete their homework. ‘This could involve providing facilities at school so that disadvantaged students have a quiet, comfortable place to work, and/or offering to help parents motivate their children to finish their homework before going out with friends or surfing the web. The homework still has to get done; but maybe students and their parents will find it a little less troublesome.’","Research spanning 65 countries shows clear link to academic performance .

"The battle of Waterloo was especially bloody. As one British rifleman who survived it said: ‘I had never heard of a battle in which everyone was killed, but this seemed likely to be an exception.’ Blinded by smoke and terrified by the slaughter, 200,000 men fought it out in an area of little more than two square miles. Men ‘were going down like ninepins’, observed the Duke of Wellington as the bodies of British lay piled in the defensive squares where they had stood. Corpses of French cavalrymen and their horses lay in mounds nearby. History is about change, and Waterloo changed everything. For this reason alone, we must celebrate its 200th anniversary next year . Despite — or perhaps because of — the carnage, Waterloo changed the course of British and European history decisively. It was the battle on June 18, 1815 when an Allied army under the Duke of Wellington broke the back of Napoleon’s army, which was then swept from the battlefield by Marshal Blucher’s Prussians. The French dictator escaped on what was the first stage of a flight that would end at St Helena in the South Atlantic, where he brooded sourly in exile over his past glories and wondered what had gone wrong. For France and the rest of Europe, his defeat marked the end of over 20 years of war that had devastated the Continent as he tried to subjugate it to his despotic rule. From Moscow to Madrid, there were ruined cities, towns and villages; hundreds of thousands had died in battle and from the epidemics spread by diseased soldiers; and there had been famines caused by plundering armies that lived off the land. Forget the glamourous uniforms of the fighting men, the Napoleonic wars had been a mass human catastrophe. Reputation: Since she replaced Michael Gove in the summer, Mrs Morgan has become known as ‘Ms U-turn’ for reversing a number of policies . And Waterloo brought them to an end — ushering in nearly 40 years of peace and reconstruction for Europe and marking the beginning of the ‘British century’, a time of industrial innovation and growth, expansion overseas and maritime supremacy. Britannia ruled the waves and Britain became the ‘workshop of the world’ as well as its banker. History is about change, and Waterloo changed everything. For this reason alone, we must celebrate its 200th anniversary next year in the same way as we are celebrating, though ruefully, the anniversaries of World War I. Yet the deliverance and remaking of Europe are deemed of little account at the Department for Education. What happened at Waterloo appears a matter of indifference to the department’s Secretary of State Nicky Morgan, who recently spurned requests to discuss how the battle might be commemorated in schools. Perhaps the snub was provoked by the National Union of Teachers’ tendency, a body of drab, glum folk who are hostile to anything that may smack of patriotism. They are repelled by history that includes flashing sabres — particularly if it involves a battle won by a Tory aristocrat in the Iron Duke, who opposed parliamentary reform. Flourish . To them, the history of the industrial working class is infinitely preferable — as long as it does not embrace those working men who wore a red coat and went to war led by Old Etonian officers. The defeat of Napoleon involved men and women from all backgrounds. Black sailors, some former slaves, manned the yardarms and cannon of the Royal Navy’s warships. Scene from 1970 film Waterloo . Yet this is a dismally myopic view. The Napoleonic wars gave huge impetus to the Industrial Revolution: steam engines powered the machines that made the ropes for Nelson’s battleships and Congreve artillery rockets were mass-produced in factories. And their conclusion allowed British industry to flourish across the globe. The Victorians who reaped the rewards of Waterloo understood this, which is why prints of dramatic scenes from the battle hung in thousands of drawing rooms and why Wellington received a magnificent state funeral. The defeat of Napoleon involved men and women from all backgrounds. Black sailors, some former slaves, manned the yardarms and cannon of the Royal Navy’s warships. Scottish, Irish and Welsh soldiers held the line at Waterloo. Some were volunteers, but many enlisted out of poverty, desperation or a chance to blow the bounty money they earned in battle on beer and brandy. The history of Waterloo and the war it ended offers a wonderful opportunity for pupils of all ages to connect with the past. Soldiers kept diaries, wrote letters or, if they survived, simply remembered what they had seen and done. And in this way ordinary soldiers discovered a voice as never before. A voice that gives them a harsh, vivid and even comic reality. Their stories are abundant and breathe life into history. A Rifleman Harris remembers how his fellow recruits merrily staggered from pub to pub to their barracks, where they quickly learned drunkenness would earn a flogging. History enthusiasts gathered in in Plancenoit, just south of Brussels, in 2005 to reenact the famous battle on its 190th anniversary . Another rifleman with a reputation as a marksman is offered a guinea by a colonel for picking off a French general and gets a further guinea for hitting the general’s aide-de-camp. Soon after he is found drunk, having spent his reward on brandy, and is duly flogged. There are tales of how humanity and decency emerged during the horrors of war. A one-armed British cavalry officer recalled how he was attacked by a French cuirassier during a melee at Waterloo. His opponent saw his empty sleeve, lowered his sabre, saluted him and rode on. And there are stories of pure courage: the bloody-minded sort is exemplified by Trooper Shaw of the Life Guards, a former prize fighter, who drank well before Waterloo, cut down a dozen lancers, then fell from his horse in an alcoholic stupor. These were also women’s wars. Many followed their husbands into battle, acting as nurses, washerwomen and cooks. Private Wheeler of the 51st recalled seeing ‘a lovely young woman, supporting the head of her dying husband’, and hearing of another who had got through a dozen husbands during the campaign. Destiny . Their men died in a brutal, all-consuming world war that ended only with Waterloo, its battles spread across the globe as France fought to extend and consolidate its empire. And the prime reason for this was the megalomania of one man, Napoleon, who imagined it his destiny to make France empress of Europe. Next year’s restaging of Waterloo on the actual battlefield is set to feature more than 6,000 re-enactors . Despite the destruction by Nelson of his battle fleet at Trafalgar in 1805, he refused to give up, waging war through the Spanish peninsula and then turning his guns East. In 1812, Napoleon thought he could bend Russia to his will and led half a million men to Moscow. He suffered a crushing defeat thanks to the determination of Tzar Alexander I and the patriotism of the Russian people. But even this did not lessen his hubris. Only at Waterloo was he seen off for good. The power politics of the Napoleonic era are full of lessons for today’s pupils. How and why does a man such as Napoleon convince himself and others that he has the power to change history? Sacrifice . Why did Frenchmen die at Waterloo shouting ‘Vive L’Empereur’ when all was lost? Was Wellington right to believe it was a prime duty of generals to win battles with as few casualties as possible — and given the carnage all around him, did he succeed? After the battle, many soldiers were so deafened by cannon fire that they were spared the shrieks of dying men and horses. There was another sound, almost more horrible — a constant chink, chink, chink. It was the noise of battlefield scavengers removing the teeth of dead soldiers, which would be sold to dentists in Britain to be made into dentures. ‘Waterloo teeth’ were much in demand for years to come because they came from young and healthy men — countless numbers of them British men who had died ridding Europe of a dictator whose downfall changed Europe’s fate beyond recognition. Surely our nation’s children should be told about their sacrifice and this extraordinary battle — in all its gory, brilliant and utterly compelling detail.","June 18 next year will be the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo .

"Shocking: Some elderly people are bombarded with as many as 10 nuisance calls a day . Some elderly people are bombarded with as many as 10 nuisance calls a day after being targeted by ruthless sales companies, a survey found yesterday. It said that frail older people get 60 per cent more sales calls than the average. The selection of vulnerable people for high pressure sales cold calling can involve ‘sucker lists’ which contain names and details of elderly people considered likely to be easily persuaded to buy over the phone. Lists can be compiled by marketing companies, sometimes using doubtful methods such as listing people who respond to fake adverts for products like hearing aids. The scale of targeting of the elderly by firms engaged in making an estimated billion nuisance calls a year was revealed by a YouGov survey. It found that more than nine out of 10 elderly people had been subjected to a nuisance sales call or a text over the past month, and nearly a quarter said they had at least two a day. While 92 per cent of those over 60 received at least one call or text, 23 per cent said they received two or more a day. This compared with just six per cent of people under 25 receiving nuisance calls at the same rate. The survey, carried out for the Sunday Times, said three out of four people who received unwanted sales calls said they hung up, half refused to answer the call, but fewer than one in six made a complaint. More than half called for stronger Governent regulation of phone marketing companies. Overwhelmingly nuisance calls came from companies trying to take over payment protection insurance claims. Nearly three quarters, 73 per cent, of people had been called by firsm seeking to profit from PPI claims that can be easily and simply made by those wrongly sold loan insurance without professional help. Targeted: The selection of vulnerable people for high pressure sales cold calling can involve ‘sucker lists’ which contain names of elderly people considered likely to be easily persuaded to buy over the phone . Some 54 per cent had calls from debt management firms and 38 per cent had taken nuisance calls from solar panel salesmen. More than a quarter reported sales calls they did not want from energy or phone companies and 16 per cent said they had unwanted sales calls from banks. Details of older callers are traded by companies that sell on details of people who have bought from them, and in some cases by lead generator companies that glean details of elderly people using methods like fake advertisements. Marketing firms that use sucker lists rely on the assumption that some older people will welcome a friendly voice on the phone and some are easily persuaded to part with their money. The targeting of older people was detailed following a report by the Government-appointed Nuisance Calls Task Force which demanded £500,000 fines for firms which break marketing rules and for directors of companies to be held personally responsible for breaches of the rules. Its report said there should be tougher regulation of firms making unwanted calls which cause ‘severe distress’.","Shocking scale of targeting of the elderly revealed by a YouGov survey .

"The son of a London nightclub tycoon appeared in court today charged with his murder. David West, 44, appeared at Westminster Magistrates’ Court charged with the murder of his father, also called David West. The 70-year-old, a flamboyant self-styled ‘lord’, died of a single knife wound at his £2.5million home in Mayfair, central London, on Friday. His son was charged with his murder after allegedly stabbing him in a drunken row. Stephen Fry said he heard ‘horrifying screams’ as his nightclub boss neighbour was killed. Case: The son of nightclub owner David West, centre, appeared in court today accused of stabbing to death his father at his home in Mayfair on Friday night . Shock: Stephen Fry (left) has revealed he heard ‘horrifying screams’ as his nightclub boss neighbour David West (right) was killed in Mayfair on Friday night . Mr West was a self-styled lord who reportedly owned the nightclub Hey Jo, as well as Abracadabra, a restaurant which specialises in Russian cuisine. Both are located close to his home. He has been described as a flamboyant figure and is said to have bought the title of “Lord of the Manor of Hollesley” on eBay. He made his fortune selling alcohol from a Calais warehouse called Eastenders, having started in business selling flowers and groceries from a stall in Romford market in east London. In 2007 he made headlines after he hired Cherie Blair to mount a legal challenge against the smoking ban. West Jr appeared in Westminster Magistrates' Court today and only spoke to confirm his name, date of birth, and address during the minute long hearing. He stood in the dock wearing  grey woollen tracksuit bottoms and a grey jumper and showed no emotion during the hearing. The brown-haired West Jr's right hand was in a cast and he looked dishevelled and unshaven. He nodded towards of a group of friends who sat in the public gallery, all of whom were smartly dressed in formal business attire. District judge Margot Coleman referred the case to Old Bailey, where it will be heard on Wednesday. The divorced father of three, who bought the title ‘Lord of the Manor of Hollesley’ on eBay, worked closely with his son David until his death. Police were called to a building where the men lived in adjacent flats at 6pm on Friday. West Jr was arrested nearby. Comedian Fry, 57, told The Sun reporters Tom Morgan and Shaun Wooller last night: ‘I was at home on Friday night when I heard these horrifying screams and wondered what was going on. ‘I looked out the window and saw Dave’s body taken out of his home and placed on the road. The emergency services were desperately trying to revive him but were unfortunately unable to do so.’ Yesterday friends paid tribute to the man dubbed ‘king of the booze cruise’ who made millions flogging £1-a-bottle wine and cigarettes to coaches of Brits. A post-mortem examination revealed that a single stab wound was the cause of Mr West's death . David West, pictured in a pink suit with his Bentley, owned a popular Mayfair nightclub and restaurant . The cockney, known for his £5,000 Italian pink suits, mullet haircut and crocodile skin shoes, rose from barrow boy to head a £100million empire and once tried to sue David and Victoria Beckham for slander for saying he was not welcome at their World Cup party despite paying £100,000 for a ticket. West said they did not want him at the 2006 ball, banned him from carrying a mobile phone and told him his pink suit was against the dress code. A High Court judge threw out the case, however. A year later, he hired barrister Cherie Blair to fight the public smoking ban – then a flagship policy of her husband Tony Blair’s government. The prime minister’s wife was taken to West’s erotic nightclub Hey Jo, named after his 21-year-old girlfriend Joanna Dudzik – who he lavished £400,000 on, then took to the High Court to try to curb her spending. Mrs Blair’s tour of the £4million club, with its explicit decor, ‘bondage booth’ and waitresses dressed as nurses, caused a sensation. The pensioner, originally from Romford, Essex, started his career as a market trader in the East End . The 70-year-old's son, also called David West, has been charged with his murder and appeared in court today . He owned Mayfair night club HeyJo (pictured) and the Abracadabra restaurant, both located on Jermyn Street . Traces of polonium-210 were later found in the club after two ex-KGB agents wanted for the murder of Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko visited in 2007. West, from Romford, Essex, started as an East End market trader before he and his wife Kathy opened greasy spoon cafes in Belgium and Calais. His firm, EastEnders, became part of Europe’s largest British-owned cash-and-carry group – with its own wine label, The Dogs B*******. His 30-year marriage failed in 1999 when he took up with a 23-year-old French blonde, quickly followed by a series of young girlfriends. West admitted trawling Russian bride websites and at one stage shared his flat with three Estonian girls. He ran a talent firm, a restaurant called Abracadabra and a Mayfair lapdancing club, Puss In Boots. He also owned 4 Star Hostel, a women’s guesthouse near Piccadilly Circus, and gentlemen’s club Mandy’s. Last night his business associate Harry Barnett, 72, who was friends with West for 60 years, said: ‘I can’t believe it. They were very close. As well as HeyJo (pictured) he also is believed to have owned a gentleman's club called Mandy's . Mr West lived in a three-bedroom house in Ormond Yard, where police and paramedics were called on Friday . ‘Dave lived with his dad all his life, apart from when he was married. It’s his other son, James, I feel for now. He is in bits.’ At his home in Brentwood, Essex, West’s youngest son James said: ‘We want to keep it a private matter.’ West once said of his children: ‘I gave them some money – enough to start their own businesses – and waved them off. ‘They drive the flash cars and wear all the trendy designer gear, but I have to hope we’ve brought them up right. The best thing in the world would be for me to see them making a go of a business. It’s all I ever wanted, and it’s all I’ve ever done.’ Last night friends remembered West online. Mickey Helliet said: ‘Really going to miss him, a real character.’ Jelena Gauthier said: ‘Such a gracious host, flamboyant man and a playful soul.’ Alex Mills, who starred in The Apprentice last year, tweeted: ‘Terribly sad news.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","David West, 70, died oknife wound at his £2.5million home on Friday .

"Officials in Florida are withholding millions worth of compensation it was ordered to pay a young boy who was tortured by his adopted parents and found close to death next to the decomposing body of his twin sister. The state settled a lawsuit following the gruesome deaths of Victor and Nubia Barahona in Palm Beach County in 2011, admitting they were at fault. But the Florida Department of Children and Families and lawyers for the state Legislature want to put the deal on hold and delay final payments indefinitely, according to the Miami Herald. The state senate has stopped the payments, claiming that if a decision is passed it may imply that the father was liable in the abuse, even though he is on trial for his daughter's murder and is facing the death penalty. Tragic: The state settled a lawsuit following the gruesome deaths of Victor and Nubia Barahona in Palm Beach County, Florida, in 2011, admitting they were at fault . Accused: The youngsters were sexually abused, starved and forced to sleep in a bathtub for years by Jorge (left) and Carmen Barahona (right). Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty in their trial . The youngsters were sexually abused, starved and forced to sleep in a bathtub for years by Jorge and Carmen Barahona. It was also revealed that they were forced to eat cockroaches consume food that contained feces. In a report published in 2011, the state said that there had been a 'systematic failure' in their safety net, after Nubia and Victor entered the welfare system as youngsters. The document stated that the tragic case showed a 'failure in common sense, critical thinking, ownership, follow-through and timely and accurate information sharing.' Nubia's naked body was found in the back of Jorge's trunk in February 2011, with a badly injured Victor in the front seat. The boy was also covered in pesticides. The young boy was put into the care of another foster family after spending several weeks in the hospital. His new foster mother told investigators that the sight of her putting on false eyelashes makes Victor remember how he lost his own lashes when his adoptive father glued his eyes shut. He has a similar reaction when his new foster father filled up a pitcher of ice water: it brought Victor back to the days when his adoptive father Jorge Barahona would bind him and his twin sister Nubia up, put them in the tub, and douse them with ice. Horrifying: The youngsters were sexually abused by their adoptive parents, starved and forced to sleep in a bathtub for years . The state initially approved a check for $1.25 million and sent it to help Victor and his new adoptive parents deal with the psychological trauma. According to the Herald they did not accept liability in the claim, but did agree not to oppose having the remaining $3.75 million in settlement funds come from the Legislature, in the form of a claim bill. However the DCF has stopped the payments to the family following a change of heart. State senate spokesman Katie Betta: 'At this point in time, as a matter of law, the father’s rights have not been terminated. That is a valid concern the Senate has to consider.' Under state sovereign immunity laws, the state is shielded from having to pay more than $200,000 when it injures someone, unless the Legislature agrees to lift the cap. General counsel of Senate President Don Gaetz, R-Niceville, George Levesque, was appointed to conduct a 'mini-trial' to assess the state's liability. Case: The state initially approved for $1.25 million to be given to help Victor, the twin brother of Nubia (pictured) and his new adoptive parents deal with the psychological trauma. But the payments have stopped . He decided that legislators would not vote on the claim bill this year as it may damage other cases related to child abuse at the hands of the Barahonas. 'The adverse finding of fact or conclusion contained in a claim bill could be used against [DCF] in the pending litigation,' Levesque said in an email to the lawyers for the family which was seen by the Herald. He added that Jorge and Carmen Barahona were Nubia’s legal parents at the time of her death. While Carmen’s rights have been taken away, Jorge could inherit any money in the child’s estate. Neal Roth, the lawyer who negotiated the settlement claimed the decision was utter nonsense and said: 'The claim bill will be referred to at least one committee and that can easily be addressed by amending the bill to specifically exclude Mr. Barahona from ever receiving any money from the settlement of this case.' 'This is, in my experience, one of the saddest commentaries on the human condition that I've ever seen,' James Loftus, director of the Miami-Dade police, said previously about the family. 'It's depressing, it's sickening to think about the circumstances that led two people, working in concert, to perpetrate this kind of horror on their own children, adopted or not.' He described the case as 'depressing [and] sickening.' After Victor was hospitalized for several weeks after the incident, he was moved into the care of foster mother Katia Garcia. Grisly scene: Nubia's decomposing body was found in the trunk of this truck in 2011. Victor was discovered badly injured in the front seat . Mrs Garcia met with police in June to discuss what she had learned from Victor about the extent of his abuse, and the horror of his experiences appears never-ending. ‘He really didn't want to remember, perhaps, but he did,’ she told investigators in a taped interview. Victor is the most upset when talking about his sister Nubia, who was found wrapped in a garbage bag in the back of Jorge Barahona’s pick-up truck after being doused with chemicals. Murdered: In spite of overwhelming evidence against them, the Barahonas say they didn't kill Nubia (pictured) Murdered: In spite of overwhelming evidence against them, the Barahonas say they didn't kill Nubia (pictured) ‘He stutters when he talks. He can’t finish his sentences,’ Mrs Garcia said. ‘He has nervous twitches with his eyes. He had one with his mouth. He doesn’t want to talk about what his sister went through.’ Both of the twins were both starved while living in the Barahona house. They were only given a piece of bread and a glass of milk once a week while their parents and their two other adopted children dined on shredded beef and rice.","Victor Barahona and his sister Nubia were abused over several years .

"They are this year’s must-have Christmas presents for selfie-obsessed Britons. So-called ‘selfie-sticks’ that allow camera phones to be extended up to a metre away for group shots and panoramic images are flying off the shelves. While the selfie might have gone mainstream in 2014, it now appears that simply taking a picture of yourself and others with your smartphone is passe. Scroll down for video . Selfie-sticks are the must-have gift this year after becoming popular in Asia. Above, a tourist uses one of the gadgets while touring London landmarks . Users are experimenting with ever more creative selfie-methods - on top of tall buildings and in front of planes - to complement the ubiquitous pictures alongside friends and celebrities. The idea of using a light-weight extendable metal pole with a grip to hold a smartphone - the early selfie-stick - came from fans of extreme sports who wanted to capture images of themselves in action. The poles took off in Asia and are now sweeping the UK after two British entrepreneurs, Neil Harvey and Steve Pengelly, spotted a gap in the market. Mr Harvey said: ‘We were at a schoolfriend’s wedding in Manila and while we were there we saw hundreds of people attaching their phones to these sticks and taking selfies. ‘When we first saw the selfie-sticks we did think “that’s a bit weird”, then we realised there was a gap in the market for something like this.’ The pair formed their own Plymouth-based company, Selfie Pods, and now produce five versions of the sticks costing upwards of £7.99. The most basic is simply as extendable pole, meaning the selfie-taker sets the phone timer to take a picture. But more advanced versions from £14.99 have Bluetooth shutter releases on the handles which link to your smartphone meaning you can control exactly when you take your picture. They come in a variety of colours and styles. As well as being popular for group shots, the sticks are increasingly appearing at sporting events and concerts as a way of getting above a crowd to capture an action image. The pair have sold 6,000 pods between August and the end of November, with another 5,000 ordered to cope with Christmas demand. Earlier this month, the South Korean authorities banned the use of ‘unregulated’ selfie-sticks after deciding their use of Bluetooth makes them ‘telecommunications devices’ that must be tested and registered in case they interfere with other gadgets. Mr Harvey added: ‘Lots of people think “what is the point of this?” but once you’ve had a go on one and seen the cool pictures you can produce without the need for a cameraperson, you realise that these little things are really quite a cool bit of kit.’","Extendable poles used to take group photos are flying off shelves .

"Amy Pascal got applause from Sony Pictures employees at a town hall meeting . Embattled Sony Pictures boss Amy Pascal has gotten applause from employees at a town hall meeting where she apologized for the damage caused by her hacked emails being released to the public. Pascal, the co-chairman of Sony Pictures, is fighting to save her job after her emails revealed racially insensitive comments and snipes at some of Hollywood's biggest stars. She was joined by CEO Michael Lynton at a brief meeting with employees on the studio's movie lot in Culver City in Los Angeles. 'It devastates me that something I did or said in a second would hurt any one of you and for that I am profoundly sorry,' she said at the meeting, according to audio obtained by Good Morning America. Employees responded by applauding Pascal, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Pascal remains defiant and is refusing to step down - despite rising calls for her to be fired over the contents of her hacked emails. Her message of regret to employees - who lined up out the door to hear her speak - is part of a wider apology tour. Pascal is reaching out to movie bigwigs, including Harvey Weinstein, to apologize in advance for more leaks of her emails, according to Variety. Sony appears to be rallying behind her, as well, and is attempting to get executives at other film studios to signs a letter of support for her and for Sony. Variety reports that many movie honchos are reluctant to be drawn into the hacking scandal - or be seen showing solidarity with Sony, lest they be targeted by hackers, too. Show of support: Sony Pictures CEO Michael Lynton appeared at a town hall meeting with Pascal on Monday to reassure employees . Lynton called the meeting on Monday to rally employees at the film studio after it was attacked by hackers who released millions of documents. 'Our business has a strong economic foundation. This won’t take us down,' he told employees, The Hollywood Reporter says. The email leaks have garnered the biggest headlines. Pascal was forced to apologize after making racially tinged remarks about President Barack Obama. Emails also reveal a producer friend calling Angelina Jolie a 'minimally talented spoiled brat,' Pascal herself called Leonardo DiCaprio 'despicable,' a fellow executive called Kevin Hart a greedy 'whore,' and she also allegedly made a joke about TV deals being the new 'black baby' - the accessory top Hollywood stars have to have. Today, a source close to the studio told MailOnline: 'This is ridiculous. Amy was making an Orange is The New Black reference and like anybody else could have, left out the comma in the middle of writing a quick email filled with shorthand and abbreviations.' However, the personal information - including social security numbers, addresses, salaries and other details - was released for some 47,000 past and current Sony employees - a devastating security breach. Sony's stock has also fallen 10percent since the leak, which came just after Thanksgiving. Hackers - possibly either from North Korea or sympathetic to the hermit regime there -  have promised a 'Christmas gift' that will 'put Sony Pictures into the worst state.'","Amy Pascal told employees: 'It devastates me that something I did could hurt any of you'

"A mysterious sleeping epidemic that makes residents of a village known as Sleepy Hollow doze off for days at a time is caused by excessive fluid in the brain, according to doctors. Doctors, however, have been unable to identify the cause of the condition that has affected residents in the remote village of Kalachi, in northern Kazakhstan, for nearly four years. Locals say the strange sleeping disorder is getting worse, with nearly 14 per cent of the towns 600 residents having been affected. Scroll down for video . Kalachi and the neighbouring town Krasnogorsk are located beside an abandoned Soviet-era uranium mine that many locals believe is responsible for causing the mysterious sleeping sickness that affects residents . Some in the remote village, which is 276 miles from the Kazakh capital Astana, now live in fear that they may never wake up from the strange sleeping disorder. Over the summer, 60 people were taken to hospital suffering from the condition, which leaves people feeling dizzy, unable to stand, fatigued and with memory problems. Some have also reported suffering from vivid hallucinations. Doctors have already ruled out viruses and bacterial infections like meningitis as the cause. Scientists have also been unable to find any chemicals in the soil or water that might be causing the sleeping sickness. Children affected by the mystery illness are so dizzy they can barely stand up by themselves and spend days at a time in bed. Doctors have been unable to work out what is causing the condition despite thousands of tests . This is one of the victims of the 'sleeping epidemic' that routinely hits areas near a disused Soviet mine . Many locals believe the cause may be coming from nearby former Soviet-era uranium mines that are now abandoned. However, miners who worked down the mine have also not been affected, while tests have shown that radiation levels in the village and the neighbouring town of Krasnogorsk, once a prosperous area but now a ghost town that surrounds the abandoned mine, are the same as background levels. The cause of the mystery illness remains a mystery, but various theories continue to circulate. Many locals believe the cause may be coming from nearby former Soviet-era uranium mines that are now abandoned. Others claim toxic waste has been buried in the area. Baffled doctors have diagnosed the sufferers with encephalopathy, a disorder of the brain, of unclear origin. Scans have shown that many of the sufferers have excessive accumulation of fluid in their brains - known as oedema. Experts fear that prolonged diffuse brain oedema could have long term consequences on the neurological development of the children's brains. But they are still no closer to finding out what might be causing the symptoms. Some have dismissed the condition as narcolepsy or even chronic fatigue syndrome, but Professor Jim Horne, a sleep expert at Loughborough University's Sleep Research Centre, thinks this is unlikely. Yet a film crew from Russia Today, who filmed a documentary about the latest outbreak in September this year, reported detecting radiation doses 16 times higher than would be expected from background radiation close to the entrance of an abandonned filled in mine shaft. Some locals claim wind and smoke coming from the mines may be responsible for the illness. Others claim toxic waste has been buried in the area. Alsu Shjeladeva, a local resident, said some men from the area had gone down the shaft in mine seven and detected a sweet smell while down there. She told Russia Today said: 'We are afraid of what lies in store. We're afraid that we may all fall asleep.' Igor Samusenko, another local resident whose son suffers from the condition, said: 'He runs around and then he gets inert, starts staggering. 'When he turns his head his eyes stay fixed as what he ws looking at. If you try to wake him it seems the wants to open his eyes but can't. 'Sleepy valley, sleepy hollow, that's what people call us.' Lyubov Belkova claims to be the first resident to have fallen asleep in April 2010 and has since suffered repeated episodes seven times. She was initially diagnosed with ischemic strokes but then her neighbour began suffering the same symptoms. Krasnogorsk has been left virtual ghost town since the closure of the neighbouring uranium mine. It was once a wealthy area with 6,500 residents but now it is home to just 130 people while 600 live in the village of Kalachi . Soon dozens of other residents in Kalachi began feeling dizzy and suffering the same symptoms. It has affected adults and children. On 1 September this year, eight children collapsed following their assembly at school. Baffled doctors diagnosed the sufferers with encephalopathy, a disorder of the brain, of unclear origin. Scans indicated that many of the have excessive fluid on their brains - known as oedema. Kair Abdurakhmanov, a senior doctor at the Regional Children's Hospital, said: 'All the kids had a CT scan. There's a diffuse brain oedema, but there's no deterioration in terms of neurological symptoms. 'There is no signs of meningitis.' Radiation levels at a filled in mine shaft were found to be 16 times higher than normal background levels . In the Soviet era, Krasnogorsk was a secret and 'closed' uranium mining town run directly from Moscow . Radiation danger signs are used to warn people as they approach the uranium mines . Experts fear that prolonged diffuse brain oedema could have long term consequences on the neurological development of the children's brains. But they are still no closer to finding out what might be causing the symptoms. Some have dismissed the condition as narcolepsy or even chronic fatigue syndrome, but Professor Jim Horne, a sleep expert at Loughborough University's Sleep Research Centre, thinks this is unlikely. He said: 'It is not likely to be narcolepsy as the symptoms affect people for very short periods of time, not days on end. 'It doesn't seem like a sleep disorder to me - more likely a mild form of encephalitis. 'Most seem to recover quite quickly - so maybe its a virus - but then several seem to go down all at once, which suggests environmental contamination as there doesn't seem to be any fever.' Russia Today said that none of its film crew suffered any unexplained sleeping problems while making the film.","Locals in Kalachi, north Kazakhstan say mystery illness is getting worse .

"A young mother was arrested on Monday for causing the death of her infant son, who died two days prior from malnutrition . Macayla Jo Armstrong remains imprisoned at Buchanon County Jail in St Joseph, Missouri on charges of child neglect. Police were called to the 22-year-old woman's home on the 1700 block of Belle Street on Saturday due to a medical emergency. Behind bars: Macayla Jo Armstrong (pictured) was arrested on Monday on charges of child neglect, two days after her infant son died of malnutrition .

"The US military has successfully tested a .50-caliber sniper round that can change direction on its way to its target. And now the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) has released a video of this Extreme Accuracy Tasked Ordnance (Exacto) program in action. The footage shows the bullet changing direction in mid-air in response to a target's movements. Scroll down for video . Once fired, actuators inside the guided bullet receive data from an optical sensor to guide it to the correct location. Small fins are used to change the bullet's trajectory, and the bullet can correct its movements 30 times a second. This grab shows the path, original aim point, and the moving target (green) According to Darpa: 'For military snipers, acquiring moving targets in unfavourable conditions, such as high winds and dusty terrain commonly found in Afghanistan, is extremely challenging with current technology. 'It is critical that snipers be able to engage targets faster, and with better accuracy, since any shot that doesn’t hit a target also risks the safety of troops by indicating their presence and potentially exposing their location.' A video from the Extreme Accuracy Tasked Ordnance (Exacto) program shows a bullet changing its direction. DARPA has not released precise details of how its bullet moves in mid-air, but this is one way in which the technology could work. Each self-guided bullet is four inches (10 cm) long. A sniper working at extreme range shines a laser onto the target. An optical sensor on the bullet detects the light from the laser to identify where the target is. Once fired, actuators inside the bullet receive data from the optical sensor to guide it to the correct location. Small fins are used to change the bullet's trajectory, and the bullet can correct its movements 30 times a second. These changes are in response to movements of the laser, which the sniper uses to continually track and light up the target. The sniper additionally has to take into account wind, distance and even the curvature of the Earth, before pulling the trigger. Darpa claims the new system is the first ever guided small caliber bullet. 'The Exacto .50-caliber round and optical sighting technology expects to greatly extend the day and night time range over current state-of-the-art sniper systems,' continued the agency. 'The system combines a manoeuverable bullet and a real-time guidance system to track and deliver the projectile to the target, allowing the bullet to change path during flight to compensate for any unexpected factors that may drive it off course. 'Technology development in Phase II included the design, integration and demonstration of aero-actuation controls, power sources, optical guidance systems, and sensors. 'The program’s next phase includes a system-level live-fire test and technology refinement to enhance and improve performance.' The current world record for the longest certified kill was by Corporal Craig Harrison of the UK Household Cavalry, who killed two Taliban in November 2009 from 1.54 miles (22.4km). The shot was approximately 3,000ft (914 metres) beyond the stated maximum range of the Accuracy L115A3 sniper rifle, used by Corporal Harrison. The Taliban were so far away it took each round almost three seconds to reach its target. Snipers typically work in two-man teams with a spotter assisting the gunman identifying targets as well as providing security. But environmental details such as wind, rain and even humidity can affect the flight path of a bullet. This graphic reveals how the Exacto bullet tracks its target and changes directions. The sniper additionally has to take into account wind, distance and even the curvature of the Earth, before pulling the trigger. DARPA has not released precise details of how its bullet moves in mid-air, but this is one way in which the technology could work. A sniper begins by shining a laser onto the target. An optical sensor on the 4-inch (10cm) Exacto bullet (illustrated) detects the laser to identify where the target is. As the bullet moves through the air, it responds to changes in the movement of the laser, which the sniper uses to continually track and light up the target . Also bullets have to counter gravity and droop down over longer distances. Under the new system, a sniper will be able to adjust the bullet's direction mid-flight in case a target moved or the bullet shifted due to a gust of wind. The newly released video shows two tests filmed earlier this year. In the both tests the round is fired deliberately off target but turns in mid-air. In the second target, the round it its intended target despite being fired several feet to the left. Ted Catchel, professor emeritus at the Naval War College said the system is a very interesting development. He told Stars and Stripes: 'I don’t know if you push a button and it takes over. I just couldn’t find out enough about the system to know how it works. 'You still need to train these snipers in the traditional methods. Right now, sniping is a real precise art.'

"The daughter of a woman who lost four stone in time for Christmas is celebrating being able to hug her mother properly for the first time. Vicky Lawson, 34, shed the pounds after joining a weight loss group in January, and Olivia, nine, said she was delighted that she would be able to wrap her arms around her. The store manager from Bolton, is down from 16st (224lbs) to 11st 7lbs (161lbs) and is now a size 12. Vicky Lawson, 34, from Bolton, piled on the pounds after getting a boyfriend (left). She would drink three vodkas a night and snack on sausage rolls but lost four stone after ditching the junk food (right) She said: 'One day Olivia came over to me and gave me a big hug and said, ""I can hug you properly now, mummy. You're not fat anymore."" 'She's only nine, so she doesn't think about what she's saying, she just says it like it is. 'She meant she can reach her arms all the way around me now when she gives me a hug. 'That's the moment I realised I could never put the weight back on. 'I didn't realise the effect my weight was having on Olivia and my oldest daughter Emily, who is 13. I think they feel a lot better and I can do more with them now.' Vicky started putting on weight when she met her husband Gary 12 years ago. As she became content, she piled on the pounds and over time her weight crept up to 16 stone (224lbs). Vicky and her husband Gary on their wedding day, with their two daughters Emily (left) and Olivia (right) Although she tried dieting several times, Vicky maintained her heavy frame until she joined Slimming World in January. She said: 'My colleague started because she was being a bridesmaid, so I went with her and I have never looked back. 'I don't see it as a diet - it has changed my life. It has made me re-think what I eat completely.' Before she joined the weight loss group, Vicky regularly munched on savoury snacks like crisps and sausage rolls. Now she follows a healthy eating plan that includes plenty of fruit and vegetables in every meal and has started to exercise, even taking part in a fun run over the summer. Vicky after taking part in the Colour Run . She said: 'I just wasn't thinking about it, I thought one sausage roll wouldn't hurt. 'I was drinking vodka diet cokes every night - I would probably have three and they weren't measured. 'I still have a drink but I'm strict on myself with a 25ml measure and only have one drink a night.' When Vicky joined her diet group she was a size 20 and struggled to buy clothes from high street shops. Vicky with her husband Gary (left) and since losing the weight (right) Since she has lost the weight, she has expanded her wardrobe and now her daughter Emily helps choose her outfits. Vicky said: 'When I first lost dress sizes, I was still going into shops and looking for a big size, then I would remember and go back and look for something smaller. 'I would never believe they would fit. My mum used to have to force me to try on smaller sizes. 'I'm half a stone (7lbs) away from my target. I want to be 11 stone (154lbs) and a comfortable size 12.

"Rough Copy have missed out on a place in The X Factor final. The group lost out to Luke Friend, after the two acts received the lowest number of votes from the public after their two performances on Saturday night's show. While they were picked by their mentor Gary Barlow and Nicole Scherzinger to go through to the final, they lost out when Sharon Osbourne chose to go deadlock – allowing Luke who received the most public votes to go through to the final. Missing out: Rough Copy will not be going through to the X Factor final after losing their place on Sunday evening . The decision means Luke will join Sam Bailey and Nicholas McDonald in the final. Gary was the first judge to cast his vote and said: ‘This is harder than usual because the acts are so different. It was an emotional sing off, you’ve both done so well.’ Louis went next and said: ‘It’s very simple – Luke Friend’ Struggling Nicole said: ‘Luke you sang one my favourite songs tonight, you are such a diamond in the rough in this competition. But the act I’m sending through is Rough Copy.’ Fight: They lost out to Luke Friend after Sharon sent the vote to deadlock . Gracious: The group were hugely thankful for the opportunity given to them . Emotional: The two acts were very emotional ahead of their performances . Sharon was last to pick and after a pause said she was going to put it deadlock, meaning the act with the most votes would go through to the final, which in this case was Luke. After they were voted of Joey, from Rough Copy told Dermot:  ‘Just being here is a highlight. I thank Gary for everything he has done for us.’ The band then turned the audience and shouted: ‘If you believe in us, make some noise.’ Can't decide: Sharon was unable to make a decision and sent the vote to deadlock . Moving: The two acts were very supportive of each other and hugged away throughout . Giving it their all: Rough Copy performed Boyz II Men's End Of The Road . Impassioned: Luke performed Keane's Somewhere Only We Know . Luke was the first act to take part  in the sing-off and he sung a very impassioned version of  Keane’s Somewhere Only We Know  with his guitar in a bid to remain in the competition. His moving performance got a standing ovation from the judges. Rough Copy were the second to sing –picking  Boyz II Men's End Of The Road and delighted the crowd moving around the stage. Performing on the show was X Factor alumni Leona Lewis, who . famously won the show in 2006. Shock: Louis Walsh couldn't quite believe that Rough Copy had been sent home . Too much: Nicholas also found the whole situation hugely emotional . The  28-year-old sung . her song One More Sleep from her upcoming festive album and the setting was . suitably Christmassy. While she started her performance looking like a Christmas tree . fairy with a full skirt – she took it off to reveal a sparkly Sixties style . shift dress with thigh high boots. She was joined on stage by dancers dressed as Christmas . trees and as various trinkets which can be found on a Christmas tree and even a . Santa Claus in latex. The final three: Sam, Luke and Nicholas all looked a little shell shocked about being in the final . So pleased: Sam and Sharon couldn't hide their happiness when they found out Sam was through . Following her performance she gave advice to the contestants: . ‘Oh my gosh, you’ve just give it all you’ve got. At this point it’s all about . topping every performance.’ When asked who she was backing, while at first she said she . couldn’t pick she admitted: ‘I’ve worked with Sam and we’ve been messaging on . Twitter, so Sam.’ Leona was followed by Canadian Crooner Michael Buble, who . performed alongside a full brass band. Over the moon: Nicholas let out a scream when he found out he was through . It was the second week that Luke found himself in the sing-off - last time it was  with Tamera . Foster but he seemed determined to give it his all on Saturday evening. Ahead of the performance, he said: 'This is a completely . different version to the original, I'm taking a big risk with this...I'm . definitely going to channel my inner diva.' For this second performance of the evening he belted out . Something About The Way You Look Tonight but said he was worried because the . last time he sang an Elton John song, he ended up in the bottom two. Break down: The Scottish singer fell to the floor as the news sunk in . Letting their hair down: Rough Copy seemed to enjoy the group song . Rough Copy meanwhile sang an upbeat version of Destiny's . Child hit, Survivor and said the words meant a lot to them as they feel like . they have been surviving the competition. Nicole said: 'The semi-finals have finally begun. Thank you . for that. You being the excitement, the life, the energy to the show. This is . the 'RC' anthem. ‘You are survivors and you are going to survive all the way . to the finals.' But Louis angered Nicole when he said the trio should have . held something back. All together now: Sam, Luke and Nicholas sung together . Christmas cheer: Before the dreaded votes Michael Buble took to the stage . Sharon agreed with him and said: 'OK, perfect song for you, . you bring a good spirit to the show. It's all overload for me, people humping . the floor, backpacks.. just pull the reigns in a bit.' But Gary scoffed: 'This is not the time to pull the reigns . in, it's the semi-final. That was electric. The vibe in this room suddenly went . up 10 gears.' For their second song they picked Sorry Seems To Be The . Hardest Word, but admitted they were concerned that what Elton does as an . artist is very different to what they would do. Fairy: Leona Lewis looked like a Christmas fairy when she performed on the show . The moment of truth: The X Factor judges looked a little apprehensive as they made their way on stage . It was perhaps only fitting that in the worst series of The X Factor for years, the best act in the semi final was sent home. Rough Copy’s posturing, emoting and crotch thrusting may have been so overboard that they looked ludicrous, but their versions of songs by Beyonce and Elton John were easily the best on Saturday night. I’m A Survivor was modern and energetic and Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word was stripped down and, unusually for this competition, in tune. By contrast young Nicholas’ rendition of Halo was judged by everyone on the panel to be ‘pitchy’ and too weedy. He admitted himself that he couldn’t connect with the song ‘because I’ve never had my heart broken or been in love’ - except perhaps with his teddy bear. Sam’s attempt to take on Candle In The Wind left her looking less like a Leona Lewis or Alexandra Burke than a rather ordinary wedding singer. As for Luke Friend, his caterwauling version of Somewhere We Only Know was so painful it was comical. Nicholas and Luke have seemingly been voted for on their youth and, in Nicholas’ case, as Louis kept reminding the audience at every opportunity, because he was from Scotland. Sam seems to be universally popular with viewers because she’s so nice. Rough Copy will probably be more successful than all of them because there’s a huge gap in the market for a UK version of Boys II Men or a more grown-up JLS. But in terms of winning it, their big mistake was to think The X Factor was a contest about singing.","Sharon Osbourne took the vote to deadlock, with Luke Friend sent through with most public votes .

"Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush on Tuesday took his most definitive step yet toward running for president, announcing plans to 'actively explore' a campaign and form a new political operation allowing him to raise money for like-minded Republicans. In a holiday message posted on Bush's Facebook page and Twitter account, the son and brother of past Republican presidents said he discussed the 'future of our nation' and a potential bid for the White House with members of his family over the Thanksgiving holiday. 'As a result of these conversations and thoughtful consideration of the kind of strong leadership I think America needs, I have decided to actively explore the possibility of running for president of the United States,' Bush wrote. Scroll down for videos . In a holiday message posted on Bush's Facebook page and Twitter account, the son and brother of past Republican presidents said he discussed the 'future of our nation' and a potential bid for the White House with members of his family over the Thanksgiving holiday. Bush spoke at commencement exercises for The University of South Carolina on Monday, telling new graduates they should avoid the impulse to pattern their lives after those of their parents . He added, 'In the coming months, I hope to visit with many of you and have a conversation about restoring the promise of America.' Kristy Campbell, a spokeswoman for Bush, said he has not yet made a final decision on whether to seek the Republican Party's presidential nomination in 2016. She said that he will announce his decision next year 'after gauging support' for a run. 'This is a natural next step and represents a new phase of his consideration process,' Campbell said. That phase will include an expansion of Bush's political operations. He said Tuesday he will start his own leadership political action committee in January, which will allow him to raise money and use it to support candidates in other races. In his statement, Bush said the committee 'will help me facilitate conversations with citizens across America to discuss the most critical challenges facing our exceptional nation. The PAC's purpose will be to support leaders, ideas and policies that will expand opportunity and prosperity for all Americans.' The Democratic National Committee fired back in mere minutes. 'Isn’t this what he’s been doing all along?' asked DNC Communications Director Mo Elleithee. 'I don’t know what the difference is between ""thinking about"" running and ""actively exploring"" running, but I suspect it has a lot to do with keeping his name in the news.' 'However you see it, there’s no parsing this simple fact: Jeb Bush has fully embraced the failed economic agenda that benefits only a select few at the expense of the middle class. That’s not going to change no matter how many different ways he says he may run.' Bush's announcement is also sure to reverberate throughout Republican politics and begin to help sort out a field that includes more than a dozen potential candidates, none of whom have formally announced plans to mount a campaign. Should he ultimately decide to run, Bush can tap into his family's vast political network and his campaign would attract strong support from the same donor pool that other establishment-minded Republicans – New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie among them – need to fuel their own prospective campaigns. GLORY DAYS: In 1999 (pictured), George H.W. Bush was in his post-presidency and his two sons George W. (left) and Jeb (right) were both governors . A Bush candidacy also has the potential to affect the plans of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who came up through Florida politics as a strong Bush supporter and is considering whether to seek re-election to the Senate or run for president in 2016. Richard Schwarm, a former Iowa state Republican Party chairman, said he expected Bush to run in the Iowa caucuses, as did his father and brother. Schwarm was among the earliest supporters of George W. Bush, and among those who went to Austin, Texas, to court the then-Texas governor in 1999. 'I think if you're going to be a national candidate you have to go where the ballots are and not be afraid to trust your campaign to Iowa voters, New Hampshire voters, Nevada voters and South Carolina voters,' said Schwarm, who considers Bush among his top considerations for president. Tuesday's statement is the latest and most definitive signal that Bush plans to try and become the third member of his family to serve as president. In a TV interview this past weekend, he said he 'would be a good president,' disclosed that he was writing an e-book about his time as governor that would come out in the spring, and promised to release about 250,000 emails from his time in office. During his two terms as Florida governor, Bush pushed for large tax cuts, overhauled Florida's education system and led the charge to eliminate race-based policies in college admissions and state spending. FIGHTING WORDS: On Monday real estate tycoon Donald Trump lobbed a rhetorical hand grenade, saying: 'I'm a Republican but the last thing we need is another Bush. And his position on immigration is ridiculous' Since leaving office, Bush has continued to advocate for more changes to the nation's schools, including the adoption of new education standards known as Common Core. Those standards have drawn the ire of conservatives who view them as a federal intrusion into local classrooms, but Bush has continued to call them critical to overhauling the country's education system, while seeking common ground with opponents by saying states should be allowed to develop their own education programs. Schwarm said while Bush holds some positions that don't sit well with some GOP activists, such as the Common Core standards, 'I think they'll realize his honesty and integrity on speaking out on his mind shows he has the courage of his convictions.' 'Iowans will give him a serious look,' Schwarm said. 'And that's all candidates can ask for. It's up to him to make the sale to Iowans.' Bush has drawn fire from right-wingers over his position on immigration, which closely mirrors that of President Barack Obama. Real estate tycoon Donald Trump said Monday night in Washington that he considered that to be a deal-breaker. 'I'm a Republican but the last thing we need is another Bush,' he said. 'And his position on immigration is ridiculous.' 'Merry Christmas and Happy Hanukkah!

"By MICHAEL MOSLEY . He's the TV doctor famous for putting his body through some of the worst fad diets the industry has to offer, as well as creating a healthy regime of his own: the 5:2 diet. Now Michael Mosley has turned his attention to doctors of a different kind - the incredible men and women who put their lives on the line to rescue animals caught up in war and natural disasters. Among them are the crack team who descended on the Philippines in the wake of Typhoon Haiyan to come to the aid of some of the millions of creatures displaced by the disaster. In this moving account, Dr Mosley reveals why their work is so important and explains why we shouldn't forget about the plight of animals - even in the midst of a human tragedy. Important work: Juan Carlos Murillo, the main vet, shows Michael Mosley how to hold a piglet . 'I am used to investigating the internal workings of the human body, but last year I found myself in the Philippines, where I spent my early childhood years. Here I learnt how to bottle-feed a fully grown male water buffalo and helped build typhoon-proof houses for litters of charming little piglets, complete with removable roofs and warm, springy floors made of special bio-degradable compost. It was like being James Herriot on an eco-friendly gap year. When Typhoon Haiyan hit this vast archipelago last year, winds of over 230 mph devastated the nation’s 7,000 islands, killing over 6,000 people in a few hours and leaving over four million more homeless. But this human tragedy was only part of the story. As the farmers suffered, millions of domestic animals were killed in the storms or died later from injuries, starvation, exposure or disease. Enter the World Society for the Protection of Animals (WSPA), an organisation dedicated to promoting animal welfare across the globe. Tragedy: When Typhoon Haiyan hit the Philippines on 8th November 2013, it killed more than 6,000 people . Aid: The typhoon also killed six million animals but vets such as Cinthya Diaz are there for those who survived . Important: Water buffaloes such as this one are a hugely important part of Filipino life . They have teams ready to come to the aid of animals caught up in natural catastrophes at four days’ notice. BBC Two asked me to join them. I’d done a series called Front Line Medicine about doctors treating British troops in Afghanistan. This was very different. I’d never been involved in veterinary work before, and that was part of the attraction. I was curious to see what vets have to do in these situations, as opposed to what medics do. I’d never thought about the scale of the problem. The figures were quite enormous, unimaginable in fact. Over six million animals died as a result of that typhoon. Some of the animals killed, maimed and at risk were pets, but far more were farm animals which provide the villagers with a vital source of income. In the Philippines that mainly means pigs, chickens and the gentle, peaceful water buffalo. If you lose a pig that may mean losing your child’s schooling for a year, not being able to pay for your daughter’s wedding or to get essential hospital treatment. It’s not that the farmers don’t care about their animals. They do. The pigs in particular are extremely intelligent creatures. They often seem to exhibit human-like emotions. They are extremely social, like to do things in groups and seem to look out for each other. After the typhoon, they were in big trouble. Their pens were destroyed, and if they weren’t killed, they were exposed to the searing daytime heat and night-time chill with no protection. On one farm my team visited hundreds of pigs had died, so Jennifer, the owner, agreed to let the team use the place to create an experimental type of pig-house, designed to be typhoon-proof, with a detachable roof and a brilliant self-cleaning compost floor. Watching this amazing, innovative construction take shape, was a bit like an episode of Grand Designs for livestock. Typhoon-proof: The vets create a sturdy new pig home on a farm where most of the animals were killed . Relief: Michael with Jennifer, the owner of a pig farm which lost hundreds of animals to the typhoon . The WSPA’s Director of Disaster Management is an adventurous 39-year-old Englishman, James Sawyer from Surrey, but the team were from many countries. Gerardo Huertas, is head of operations, a thoughtful intellectual type with 30 years experience in the field. Juan Carlos Murillo (‘JC’), the main vet, has a strong sense of a calling. The day-to-day logistics was in the hands of Cinthya Diaz, a bright, and unusual young woman who had started out working as a wedding planner and then got involved with rock music. She needed those complementary skills to get things done. I really liked their blend of different characteristics. They have a huge appetite for the work, in fact they are quite addicted to the adrenalin rush of going in and sorting things out. They had been everywhere and done everything. And they were prepared to drop everything and go anywhere at any time. They must have very understanding partners at home. What’s striking about Juan Carlos Murillo, this team’s vet, is the empathy he has for large creatures. He was trying to teach the local vets more humane ways of handling them. He is a real Dr Dolittle, demonstrating how you can calm a cow or water buffalo down and position it so that you can examine it. Job well done: After completing their work in the Philippines, the vets headed to Kenya and a drought . JC showed me how to get a buffalo to drink medicine by serving it in a lager bottle gently pushed into its mouth at the side of its tongue. The beast then rolled it around like Marlon Brando in ‘The Wild One’ rolling his cigarette from side to side, until the medicine had gone down. Other stand-out moments for me included watching the sperm being collected from a massive boar, enough to sire hundreds of piglets, and a disturbing visit to a farm where they raise fighting cocks. When they train them they put pads over their spurs, like boxers sparring, but when I saw the long, razor-sharp blades they use for real fights, I decided I had seen enough. In the end it became a hearts and minds campaign as the team devised sustainable, economic solutions to animal welfare problems and trained the locals in more effective ways of delivering life-saving treatment. You’d imagine they might suffer from ‘disaster fatigue’, but they’re surprisingly fresh-faced and enthusiastic about it all, happy to get up at 5.00am and work until a meeting at 10.00pm at night. And when they had finished in the Philippines, they had new, imminent disasters lined up to head off to next: a drought in Kenya and a possible volcanic eruption in Indonesia.

"Scouted at the tender age of 15, Naomi is still one of the world's most in-demand models despite working in the industry for nearly 30 years; it's no wonder she's dubbed a 'super'. Need proof of her longevity? The Brixton-born model has been unveiled as the face of two major fashion campaigns this week - and it's only Tuesday. On Monday, the 44-year-old was unveiled as the face of Burberry, alongside Jourdan Dunn. Today, she has has stripped off as the star of Agent Provocateur's SS15 campaign. Scroll down for video . Looking good! Naomi Campbell  has been unveiled as the face of two major fashion campaigns this week, her latest? Smouldering as the face and body of Agent Provocateur . The model and party girl thinks it's 'great' she's been chosen to front the lingerie brand's new line because, she says, it proves women of any age can be sexy. 'It's great to be the face of Agent Provocateur's Spring Summer 2015 campaign, especially in my forties! The supermodel was selected for the campaign for just that reason, with Agent Provocateur's creative director Sarah Shotton reiterating the message. Honoured: Speaking about her latest campaign, the 44-year-old said: 'It's great to be the face of Agent Provocateur's Spring Summer 2015 campaign, especially in my forties!' She explained: 'Agent Provocateur proves that beautiful lingerie applies to, and is appreciated by, women of all ages.' Naomi Campbell is meant to be Agent Provocateur’s 'mercurial femme fatale' with a killer instinct and a body to match, say the brand. The steamy images of Naomi were taken by photographer and director Ellen von Unwerth, who specialises in erotic femininity and worked as a fashion model herself for ten years before moving behind the camera. Hand-selected: The supermodel was selected for the campaign by creative director Sarah Shotton because she wanted to prove that women of all ages can look great in their lingerie . Sarah added to Style.com: 'Naomi and Ellen were perfect for this, as they both have such strong, individual personalities. 'We chose Ellen, as her aesthetic mirrors the sensual, mysterious undertones of the campaign concept impeccably. Naomi is the ultimate Agent Provocateur woman: witty, gorgeous and confident.' Naomi's schedule has been jam-packed lately. She and Jourdan Dunn, 24, teamed up for the first time ever for Burberry's all new SS15 campaign. The British beauties are seen posing in a range of the popular brand's colourful coats and dresses, as they tote bags bearing Burberry's distinctive plaid pattern. Nerves: Despite her unprecedented success - she's worked for every major fashion house - Naomi recently admitted that even she gets nervous before a catwalk appearance, although she looks pretty confident in this shoot . The catwalk stars are joined in the Mario Testino-shot, Christopher Bailey-directed campaign by British musicians George Barnett and George Le Page. 'It is always a pleasure to work with Mario Testino; we came up in the business together 28 years ago, so have an understanding and ease in working together,' Naomi said in a statement. 'His photography is special and the results are always stunning. And I was thrilled to work with Jourdan Dunn for the first time - it was a lot of fun. 'But above all, it’s always rewarding for an artist to work on a campaign for a world-class product.' South London native Naomi is returning to model for the label for the first time since her 2001 campaign alongside Kate Moss. Big name: As one of the 90’s supers, which also included Cindy Crawford, Kate Moss, Linda Evangelista and Christy Turlington, Campbell’s life has been star-studded . Despite her unprecedented success - she's worked for every major fashion house - Naomi recently admitted that even she gets nervous before a catwalk appearance. Speaking to Net-a-Porter's The Edit, she said: 'I still get scared. I cross myself before I go onto the runway. I pray my dress isn’t going to fall off.' Her biggest fear, she says, is fear itself. 'If you feel fear, fear will come to you. Fear is a terrible thing to have and I’ve been aware of that since I was a kid. It can stop you doing things in your life. I don’t want fear to get hold of me.' Luckily for Naomi, she's been able to share the experience with her 'fashion family' - a starry host of models, designers and photographers, who have helped nurture her along the way. 'I definitely spent more time around them than around my own blood family as I was traveling and working so much… Azzedine [Alaïa] is more like a papa; Gianni [Versace] was more like a brother,' she said. Another day, another campaign: On Monday she and Jourdan Dunn, 24, teamed up for the first time ever for Burberry's all new SS15 campaign . As one of the 90’s supers, which also included Cindy Crawford, Kate Moss, Linda Evangelista and Christy Turlington, Campbell’s life has rocked and rolled between extremes but she is, above all, a survivor. 'I don’t have to justify myself to anyone. I took off almost five years from work,' she said. 'But I’m a Gemini and I like to keep moving and doing things and being there for friends. If I go against my instincts, there is always a consequence.' And one special man has helped her along the way - and now she wants to help others. '[Nelson] Mandela always said to me: ""Use yourself to help other people."" 'I feel that now more strongly than ever before and I try to do that in the best way I can,' she said. She is certainly doing just that - she's raised millions for causes including Hurricane Katrina and the Haiti earthquake. In response to the current Ebola threat, she has launched the #CrushEbolaNow campaign with other celebrities, which aims to educate and raise funds to help fight the spread of the deadly virus.","Supermodel was chosen to prove women of any age can look amazing .

"North Korea made threats to the London School of Economics before the row over the BBC’s controversial undercover film went public. The dictatorship warned that the ten students who visited its capital with Panorama journalists would be exposed if the documentary were broadcast. In a letter to the BBC, the university then made plain its anger, arguing that the students had been put in danger and had not been properly informed about the risks. But the Corporation flatly rejected the demands not to broadcast, insisting that the students were told about the plans. The programme aired as planned last Monday and was watched by 5.1 million people. Controversy: Panorama reporter John Sweeney with a North Korean colonel. Sweeney travelled to the country with students from the London School of Economics, which was reportedly threatened by Pyongyang before the programme aired . An LSE spokesman denied yesterday that its protest was motivated only by the threats to publish the students’ passport details. The Mail on Sunday has learned that several days before the row surfaced, the university was contacted by a North Korean government aide, Alejandro Cao de Benos. Mr Cao de Benos, a Spaniard, spends six months a year in Pyongyang, where he has close ties with senior figures in the dictatorship. He hosts foreign delegations and acts as an intermediary for external parties wanting to invest, make documentaries or simply visit the country. The rest of the year he acts as a roving ambassador, making media appearances and effectively acting as a government spokesman. In an email to the BBC on April 9, he said he was ‘in communication with LSE representatives regarding the abuse of the name of their  institution and other students’. He warned that broadcasting the  programme would leave him no choice but to ‘expose all the real story and data’. In the fall-out from the affair, six of the ten students turned on the university, claiming that it has placed them in greater danger than the trip itself. They complained that the decision to speak publicly about the expedition, led by the Panorama presenter John Sweeney, had exposed them to threats from Pyongyang. In an open letter to LSE director Craig Calhoun and chairman Peter Sutherland, the students said: ‘We feel that we have now been put in more risk than was originally the case, as a result of the LSE’s decision to go public with their story.’ The students said they were told in London that a journalist would accompany them and that they risked deportation or detention if the true purpose of the trip were uncovered. In Beijing, before they flew to Pyongyang, they were informed that Sweeney was the journalist and that he worked for the BBC. Dangerous: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has ramped up tensions in recent weeks, threatening to launch a nuclear war . But responding to the students’ letter, the LSE’s director of external relations, Robin Hoggard, said: ‘All ten of you were deliberately deceived, by the BBC’s own admission. You weren’t in a position to give informed consent. ‘And it isn’t just about you. What the BBC have done has had implications for not just the whole LSE community, perhaps especially our academics, but for LSE as an institution and for independent academics more widely. ‘Finally, we did not “go public”. The BBC put us in an impossible position. We knew that LSE would be publicly identified if any LSE students were recognisable on Panorama (several were). And even if they weren’t, the North Korean regime had threatened to reveal the details of all of you on the visit, and how the journalists gained entry to North Korea by claiming to be LSE  students or staff.’","Intermediary acting for Kim Jong Un threatened to reveal passport details of students .

"A romantic couple stunned their friends and family by inviting them to a made-up movie premiere at a cinema - which turned out to be their wedding day. Darren Yates, 40, told 100 of their guests that he had a cameo role in a Hollywood blockbuster called Match Made In Heaven, only for the attendees to arrive at the cinema to find it was the couple's wedding ceremony. The groom and his fiancee Katherine Yates, 34, were so determined to fool their friends and family they even designed fake posters and a voiceover trailer for the fictional film and posted VIP tickets for the screening. Scroll down for video . Darren and Katherine Yates surprised their friends by inviting them to the cinema and then getting married . The pair screened a video of their proposal  before astonishing guests with an unannounced wedding . But guests were left gobsmacked when they took their seats in the Electric Cinema in Birmingham on Saturday, 13 December, and discovered that they were going to watch them get hitched. Instead of the Hollywood movie, they were shown a two-minute short film called Haribo Man which Darren and Katherine had filmed over the past month. Its star Darren is chased by dogs before hitching a lift in a Lamborghini before switching to Del Trotter's three-wheeler van as he races to propose to Katherine with a Haribo-sweet ring. The already stunned guests were then shocked once more when a registrar stood up and the UK's oldest working cinema turned into a wedding venue. Darren and Katherine, both from King's Norton, Birmingham, walked down the makeshift aisle to the song Best Day Of My Life by rock band American Authors and tied the knot in front of their friends and family. The couple decided to surprise their loved ones by getting married exactly a year to the day after they first met at work. The couple sent out invitations claiming that Darren had a cameo role in a new flick Match Made In Heaven . Darren, a communications and engagement officer, met Katherine, who works as a quality and compliance officer, through their job at West Midlands Police. The prankster groom says that no details were overlooked when it came to fooling their guests. 'We sent out tickets and a VIP letter and they thought I had a cameo role in a Universal Pictures film. 'I even got a guy in America to do a voiceover for me so people thought it was all genuine. 'We were upstairs hiding but after my little film had been played the registrar stood up and said ""it's now going to be a wedding"".' Guests saw a film called The Haribo Man in which Darren proposes to Katherine with a jelly sweet ring . After the film  Darren and Katherine  walked down the aisle to the shock and delight of family and friends . Darren added that the surprise element to their wedding helped make their day extra memorable for them both. 'Everybody gasped and then we walked out and they were all clapping, it was just fantastic. 'I know people have proposed in a cinema before but I don't think anybody has surprised their guests and had a spontaneous wedding,' he said. Katherine was also in on the secret which the couple first started planning six months ago in the summer. The couple, who met at work, married in front of the big screen in Britain's oldest working cinema . The besotted bride added that the ceremony had been everything she had hoped for and more. 'It was a wonderful day, I had an idea in my mind of what it was going to be like but just exceeded everything I thought it would be. 'It was just magical and getting the reaction off people who were there and didn't have a clue was amazing. 'The fact that it was such a surprise for everything added to the magic of the day. Darren and Katherine said that they wanted to skip the engagement and just go straight to the wedding . 'We just wanted people to come and enjoy themselves rather than spend money on a dress and hat.' The couple, who are expecting their first child together in April, spent several weekends making Haribo Man which was filmed across Birmingham. Darren, who has a daughter Emily, 11, from a previous marriage, said: 'We were thinking about getting engaged and Katherine said forget getting engaged, let's just get married. The newlyweds outside the Electric Cinema, Birmingham, with the Del Boy Reliant Robin featured in their film . 'People who were there said it was the best wedding they had ever been to which was just what we wanted.' Katherine, who has a son Liam, 12, from a previous relationship, added that Darren's creative input had helped make the day perfect. 'We were throwing some ideas together and Darren is a genius when it comes to creative things like this. 'It just went from strength to strength and we decided to do it as a surprise which went down so well with everyone.' After the unconvential nuptials,  the couple had a more traditional evening party at a converted barn in Sutton Coldfield, West Mids.","Darren Yates, from King's Norton, Birmingham, told friends he had film role .

"Most holiday snaps have a fascinating tale behind them, but few are better than the story that Emily Demello can tell following her trip to Cuba. The 21-year-old Canadian woman lost her waterproof digital camera in the sea when she visited the Caribbean island with friends two years ago. She was heartbroken after losing precious snaps that showed the group relaxing on the beach and frolicking in the ocean, but they have been recovered thanks to a scuba diver. Emily Demello (right) poses for a photo with friends Madisen Singer (left) and Hailey Olson in Cuba . The photos were returned to Miss Demello after the camera was discovered by diver Ruben Urquiza . Emily, a marketing student from Vancouver, lost her camera in two feet of salt water while staying at an all-inclusive resort in Varadero with friends Madisen Singer and Hailey Olson in January 2012. She told MailOnline Travel: ‘My dad originally bought me this shockproof, waterproof camera because I’m extremely clumsy. ‘He said it was ""Emily proof"". I was taking photos with my friends in the ocean maybe three days into the trip and I got hit by a big wave which knocked the camera out of my hand. ‘We looked for the camera for about 20 minutes, walking around the area in the water and walking along the beach. As soon as it was gone the current must have taken it away, though.’ Miss Demello lost the camera when she was hit by a big wave while holidaying in Varadero in January 2012 . The camera's memory card contained about 100 photos and video clips from the first few days of the trip . Emily was 18 at the time and it was one of her first trips abroad with her friends. ‘It was disappointing that I still managed to lose the camera, even with all of its safety features. We did have other cameras but had lots of video diary footage on my camera that we had been taking since the trip began.’ There were about 100 photos and video clips on the memory card, and as luck would have it one of the pictures was of her boarding pass, which had her name printed on it, on the long journey from Vancouver to Varadero. That’s how Ruben Urquiza managed to track her down. The camera had been damaged but the memory card was still intact when it was found by Ruben Urquiza . Mr Urquiza tracked down Miss Demello after finding an image of her boarding pass, which had her name on it . Emily Demello says she started 'freaking out' after Ruben Urquiza contacted her on Facebook . Ruben, a professional diver, found the camera - damaged from being pounded by waves - a year ago while he was diving in the ocean off the coast of Varadero, but the memory card was intact. But he didn't get around to finding Emily until this month because he only recently gained access to the internet, she said. He downloaded the photos and video clips to his computer and scrolled through them, spotting the image of the aeroplane ticket with Emily’s name on it. From there, Ruben was able to track down Emily on Facebook, sending a friend request and a message that had one of the photos attached to prove that it wasn’t a bizarre hoax. In his Facebook message, he wrote: ‘Hi Emily, I am from Cuba, my name is Ruben. I know that you was in my country in 2012 because I am diver in Varadero and I found your camera in the beach, please accept me in your Facebook friends and I will send you your pictures! I am sorry my bad English, have a nice Sunday!’ [sic] . Emily said: ‘At first I thought it was just a stranger wanting to be friends on Facebook but as I actually read [the message] I was freaking out. ‘I ran downstairs right away to tell my family what happened. I think it’s an amazing story – it really seems like it’s something out of a movie. ‘There are people like Ruben, doing great things everywhere. It means a lot that he took the time to find me and send my pictures back to me. Nothing stays lost forever.’","Emily Demello dropped the camera when she was hit by a large wave .

"You'd be forgiven for thinking the man who revolutionised interior design, making himself the fifth wealthiest businessman in the world in the process, lived a life of unimaginable luxury and splendour. Yet Ingvar Kamprad, the founder of global juggernaut IKEA, lives in an unassuming bungalow, favours the meatballs sold by his stores and only ever flies economy class, even though he could own a private jet without it even denting his personal fortune. Mr Kamprad, who turns 87 tomorrow, even shops in the local market towards the end of the day in order to scoop up bargains, reports the Daily Express. It is reported that he was once turned away from a swish business awards ceremony because he had just hopped off the bus and takes home the packets of salt and pepper from cafes. Swedish furniture manufacturer Ikea founder Ingvar Kamprad and late wife Margaretha at a local shop in Sweden. The billionaire is notoriously careful with money . It is a remarkable existence for the man behind a company that recorded an annual net profit of £3.2billion and achieved sales of £27.6billion throughout 44 countries. IKEA’s domination of the home-furnishing market is phenomenal. It is the planet’s third largest consumer of wood and there are more IKEA catalogues printed per year (208 million at the last count) than there are bibles. In the UK, where the company first set up shop in 1987, it was voted the country’s most popular shop in a survey, and the average size of its stores is 300,000 square feet - the equivalent of 42 football pitches. Modest: The home of IKEA founder, Ingvar Kamprad, in Switzerland . Success: Kamprad's company is estimated to be the source of a tenth of all beds in Europe . Such is its success, it is said that one in 10 Europeans is now conceived on an Ikea bed. But this frugality, while genuine, is argued by some to be a facet of his intensely canny ability to manage his own image and that of the company, as evidenced by his expert handling of revelations that he was a member of the pro-fascist New Sweden Movement in 1942. He doubled his company's charitable donations to nearly £100million and begged employees to forgive him. A former executive assistant, Johan Stenebo wrote in a book on Mr Kaprad: 'He wanted to appear a man of the people, one of us.' Kamprad photographed at the company's head office in Almhult, Sweden. At one point he was reportedly the richest man in the world . Indeed, the self-confessed recovering alcoholic owns a large country estate in Sweden and a vineyard in Provence on top of the Swiss bungalow. He also wore bespoke suits and drove a Porsche in the 1960s. Mr Stenebo added: 'Ingvar casts himself as the underdog, presenting himself to the world as a somewhat dim, alcoholic dyslexic. He tells people he has many shortcomings, that he is slightly stupid. 'Yet he remains incredibly sharp and knowledgeable down to the smallest detail. 'He will tell you in seconds how much Russian pine sawn on the spot, glued and then refined in Poland would cost in a Swedish store. Ingvar Kamprad as a young boy (left).

"The Philippines military has been pictured handing huge wads of cash to masked informants, who gave up information on al-Qaeda-linked terrorists, in a bid to encourage more sources to come forward. An astonishing series of photographs show four tipsters clasping bounties of up to 5.3 million Philippines pesos ($120,454) each inside the military headquarters at Camp Aguinaldo, east of Manila. The military released the photographs to illustrate the huge rewards available to police sources, in a bid to encourage more informants to come forward – but the men pictured are clad in hoods, heavy jackets and sunglasses to protect their identities. A Filipino hooded civilian informant holds his bounty reward for the arrest of suspected Abu Sayyaf members inside the military headquarters camp at Camp Aguinaldo, east of Manila, Philippines . The rewards follow the arrest of suspected of members of Abu Sayyaf - an extremist group of al-Qaeda-linked militants responsible for some of the deadliest terrorist attacks in the Philippines. According to local reports, Armed Forces of the Philippines deputy chief of staff, Lt. Gen. John Bonafos handed over a total of 12.1 million Philippines pesos ($270,000) to the four informants. It is thought they assisted in the arrest of a rebel leader of the New People's Army (NPA) - named as Maria Loida Tuzo Magpatoc - as well as members Abu Sayyaf. Reports state that Magpatoc, also known as 'Gwen' and 'Bebyang', carried a reward of 5.6 million Philippines pesos ($125,000) on her head. The military believe The NPA, whic is the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines, was responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands, as well as kidnappings of locals and foreigners. The Abu Sayyaf members arrested  were identified as Basal Talb Sali and Abu Husni, who carried a reward of 5.3 million Philippines pesos ($118,000) for their arrest, and Muktar Ladjaperma and Jailanl Basirul, who carried a 600,000 Philippines pesos ($13,000) reward for their arrest. Armed Forces of the Philippines Deputy Chief of Staff, Lt. Gen. John Bonafos hands over the cash rewards . The four police informants were clad in hoods, masks and dark glasses to protect their identities . The Abu Sayyaf has also been held responsible for high-profile kidnapping for ransom cases involving foreign hostages. The group claims it is fighting to establish an independent Islamic homeland in the Muslim populated south of the mainly Catholic Philippines. In July, a video appeared on Youtube in which one of the Abu Sayyaf's leaders, Isnilon Hapilon, pledged allegiance to the Islamic State extremists who have taken control of large parts of Iraq and Syria. But local authorities regard the group as a non-idealogical band of criminals chiefly focused on the lucrative business of kidnapping for ransom. Earlier this month, a Swiss man kidnapped by the group escaped after nearly three years in captivity following a fierce struggle with one of his captors over a machete. It is considered a terrorist organisation by the United States, which has provided military assistance and training to Filipino troops to hunt down the group. The Philippines military hope the rewards will encourage more sources to come forward with information .","Four masked and hooded informants are seen clasping bundles of cash .

"For most people, solving a Rubik’s cube is hard enough - many houses have one of the unsolved puzzles stored away in a cupboard somewhere, away from frustrated eyes. So if you fall into that group, look away now - because one company has made a giant version of the popular toy. With more than 18 times more squares than the regular toy, the latest gadget promises to confound a whole new generation this Christmas. Hong Kong-based Brando has released a larger version of a Rubik's cube (shown). Each of its six sides have a huge 169 coloured tiles - 1,014 in total . Called the Pillow 13x13x13 IQ Brick, the cube is formed from 13 squares in a row on each side of the cube. In total the 3D puzzle features 1,014 coloured tiles that have to be matched up in order to complete the buzzle. That means each side has a rather daunting 169 coloured tiles, compared to just the nine found on a regular Rubik’s Cube. Its makers, Hong Kong-based Brando, claim it is ‘good for creative thinking and improving both your IQ and EQ [emotional intelligence]’. However, anyone wanting to try and solve the puzzle might be put off by the price - a whopping £205 ($320) - which is almost as head scratching as the toy itself. Brando says the toy has a quality design and is made to handle smoothly. It is also apparently good for training both your left and right brain, according to the company. However, with regards to any hints to solving it, Brando only suggests taking a ‘tea break’ and retrying it. The Pillow 13x13x13 IQ Brick has more than 18 times more squares than the regular toy - which has 54. It is also slightly curved on each side. But the price is equally challenging - at a whopping £205 ($320) Brando, claim the toy is ‘good for creative thinking and improving both your IQ and EQ [emotional intelligence].' But to solve it all they recommend is a 'tea break' and to try again . The original Rubik's cube (shown) was invented by Hungarian architect Erno Rubik in 1974 - but compared to the latest version, it has just a paltry 54 coloured tiles . Single time: Mats Valk of the Netherlands in March 2013 with a time of 5.55 seconds at the Zonhoven Open in Belgium. Average time: Feliks Zemdegs at the Melbourne Cube Day 2013 with a 6.54 seconds average solve time. One-handed solving: A time of 9.03 seconds was made by Feliks Zemdegs at the Lifestyle Seasons Summer 2014 . Feet solving: Fakhri Raihaan solved a Rubik's Cube with his feet in 27.93 seconds at the Celebes 2012. Robot: Cubestormer 3 solved a Rubik's Cube in 3.253 seconds - beating the Cubestormer 2's record of 5.27 seconds. A few days ago, Marcin Kowalczyk produced a moment for fans of the original Rubik’s cube to savour - when he solved the puzzle blindfolded in just 21.17 seconds - a new world record. The speed cuber took a few seconds to memorise the pattern on the Rubik’s cube and then, while blindfolded, he needed just a few more to solve it during a competition in Szczecin in western Poland. A judge held a piece of paper between Marcin's face and his hands to make sure he couldn't peek under his mask. His celebration was subdued, however, as he jumped out of his chair and remained quiet out of respect for other competitors who were still trying to solve the puzzle. Quite how he’d cope with the 13-cubed Rubik’s cube while blindfolded remains to be seen - or rather not seen.","Hong Kong-based Brando has released a larger version of a Rubik's cube .

"The end of the computer is nigh. When the clock strikes 14 minutes and seven seconds past three on the morning of Tuesday 19 January 2038 UTC, a bug is expected to hit the web. Any computer, program, server or gadget running a 32-bit system could then fail, on a global scale, unless they are patched and upgraded in advance. This is known as the Year 2038 Problem, and is a theory that was recently proved when Psy's Gangnam Style exceeded two billion views on YouTube. Scroll down for video . The Year 2038 Problem affects software using a 32-bit system. Once the time reaches 03:14:07 UTC on Tuesday, 19 January 2038, affected computers will not be able to distinguish between the real time and date, and the year 1901. This could wipe out programs that rely on the internal clock to make measurements . The Year 2038 Problem, or Y2038, specifically affects software using a 32-bit integer system. It is a similar problem that was faced in the year 2000, when the Millennium Bug, also known as the Y2K, meant certain computers couldn't distinguish between the years 1900 and 2000. 32-bit systems use four bytes, which mean they can use 4GB of memory in one go. By comparison, a 16-bit system uses two bytes and 64-bit systems use eight. Once the bug hits, affected computers will not be able to distinguish between the real time and date, and the year 1901. For some computers this will simply mean the date is shown as incorrect, but it could equally wipe out computers and programs that rely on the internal clock to make precise measurements, for example. It could also cause software to crash. Many phones, for example, as well as flight systems and cars use embedded systems that rely on storing accurate times and dates. Some programs that work with future dates may also start experiencing problems sooner. For example, a program that looks ahead 20 years will need to be fixed by 2018. After 2018, it won't be able to register dates after 19 January 2038 and bugs may appear. These systems store memory and carry out processes using binary digits, represented as 0 or 1 - and the total number of digits a 32-bit system can represent is 4,294,967,295. But because half of the values are negative, and half are positive this doesn't range from zero up to 4,294,967,295. Instead, the total numbers range from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647, thus making the upper limit of a 32-bit system 2,147,483,647. This means there is only a limited amount of storage that can be used to store all the binary 0 and 1 numbers. YouTube was set up on a 32-bit system and when Psy's Gangnam Style video reached this upper limit of views, the counter broke. To solve the problem, Google updated the system to 64-bits, which can handle 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 views, or more than 9 quintillion. At the time, Google said in a blog post: ‘We never thought a video would be watched in numbers greater than a 32-bit integer (=2,147,483,647 views), but that was before we met PSY. ""Gangnam Style"" has been viewed so many times we have to upgrade!’ The standard four-byte format assumes the beginning of time is 1 January, 1970, at 12:00:00 a.m. When the clock strikes 03:14:07 UTC on Tuesday, 19 January 2038, a total of 2147483647 seconds since 1 January 1970 will have passed. The GIF above illustrates how the binary code, the decimal number and the date will appear when computers reach 03:14 UTC on 19 January 2038. To solve the problem, software manufacturers will need to update to a 64-bit system . YouTube was set up on a 32-bit system and when Psy's Gangnam Style video reached the system's upper limit of the amount of data it can store, the counter broke.

At the time of writing, 2,175,046,789 people have watched the music video with its distinctive horsey dance. The number is displayed after digits spin around (screenshot) when the mouse hovered over them . The Year 2038 Problem, or Y2038, specifically affects software using a 32-bit integer system and has been theorised for years. 32-bit systems use four bytes, which mean they can use 4GB of memory in one go.

Computers will then not be able to distinguish between the real time and date, and the year 1901. This is called an 'integer overflow', and means the counter has run out of usable bits and begins reporting a negative number.

As Economist journalist Glenn Fleishman explained: 'Modern versions of the operating system have solved this problem by moving to a 64-bit signed integer to count seconds, but some ancient devices or those running ancient software may fail unpredictably.'

"An eighth-grade student has shot himself dead in what initially appeared to be a hunting accident, authorities have said. Fourteen-year-old Logan Hinrichs, from Red Wing, Minnesota, was in Maiden Rock, Wisconsin, which is about 18 miles from his home, when he died from the gunshot wound, authorities said. A sheriff's deputy with Pierce County told MailOnline that it was initially believed that Logan had died in a hunting accident but they now believe he took his own life. The teenager was found by relatives, who contacted the department. Authorities said they are not releasing any further information due to the nature of his death and that they are still investigating. Loss: 14-year-old Logan Hinrichs, pictured, died from a gunshot wound on Saturday . Students at Logan's school, Red Wing High School, learned about the tragedy when Superintendent Karsten Anderson sent out an alert Monday morning. 'The school district is implementing its crisis management plan to provide as much support as possible during this difficult time,' the message said, the Red Wing Republican Eagle reported. 'High school students and staff members were notified this morning, and we are providing counselors and other support.' A gofundme page has been set up for the Hinrich family to help with the boy's funeral expenses. The page explained that his parents, Luke and Emmy, are on a single income due to health issues. By Tuesday morning, the page had raised nearly $7,000 of their $10,000 goal. On Logan's Facebook page friends paid tribute to the teen. 'Logan you were a great kid,' one wrote. 'Everyone is gonna miss ya dude.' A Memorial service will be held for Logan on Thursday morning at the First Covenant Church before his burial will be at Maiden Rock Cemetery.","Logan Hinrichs took his life on Saturday and his body was discovered by relatives, authorities said ."
