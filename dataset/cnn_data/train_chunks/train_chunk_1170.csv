"These stunning photos capture the spectacular scenes in Scotland last night - where the Northern Lights illuminated the sky with colour. The deep purple and green bands of shimmering light were caught by award-winning photographer Maciej Winiarczyk - who spends much of his time snapping the aurora borealis. The pictures were taken in Caithness, north Scotland - where people were treated to an extraordinary rare glimpse of the phenomenon. Scroll down for video . The pictures were taken in Caithness in the north of Scotland - where people were treated to a rare glimpse on the phenomenon . Mr Winiarczyk said: 'Every aurora display is unique and you never know how it will develop over time. 'It's always intriguing and awe-inspiring and it's a very photogenic subject. I really like the dynamism of the whole spectacle. 'I could watch them every night and never get bored.' The display is usually only seen from more northerly locations such as Scandinavia, Canada and parts of Russia. But recent solar flares have meant electrically-charged particles - which are the cause of the light displays - have appeared further south than usual. Recent solar flares have meant electrically-charged particles - which are the cause of the light displays - have appeared further south than usual . Last night, a solar flare hurled vast clouds of these particles towards Earth – producing displays such as this one, not only in Scotland, but also in some parts of north England. Known as coronal mass ejections, the clouds can produce an array of colours including green, pink, red, blue and yellow. Mr Winiarczyk added: 'I was expecting the aurora display because a big explosion on the sun was reported with clouds of ejected plasma coming towards earth. Last night, a solar flare hurled vast clouds of these particles towards Earth – producing displays such as this one . 'There was a forecast for a big geomagnetic storm of G3 level, with potential for a sparkling aurora visible as far south as the south of England. 'We are still close to the peak of activity of the sun, which is main cause of the auroras, so we can still expect some good displays in the months ahead.' Mr Winiarczyk, who is also a structural engineer, said he was lucky to get such good results as it seemed the elements were against him. The deep purple and green bands of shimmering light were caught by photographer Maciej Winiarczyk - who spends much of his time snapping the aurora borealis . He said: 'On the photographs, the aurora looks quite clear but to the naked eye the display was not so obvious, as there was very bright moonlight in the sky washing out faint aurora details. 'The air was very foggy and there were plenty of clouds around so I spent more time driving around looking for clear locations than actually taking pictures. 'The best nights for observing auroras is when the Moon is out of the sky and it is really dark.'

"Money flowed, jazz music rang out, and fashionable young women in 1920s London, Paris and New York set aside behaviour previously deemed 'appropriate' in favour of high spirits, short skirts, hedonism and social liberation. These giddy, creative, enthusiastic women of the Roaring Twenties' were named 'flappers' because of their effervescent personalities. They were writers, actresses, painters, society heiresses, and they were a new breed of women typified by newly bobbed hair, thick make-up and predilections for smoking, drinking, dancing the Charleston... and then some. As Baz Luhrmann's new cinematic remake of F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1925 novel The Great Gatsby prepares for release, global interest in the era is piquing. And a new book now lifts the lid on the most infamous of these flapper women - from Fitzgerald's American wife Zelda and US actress Tallulah Bankhead, to Britain's high society heiresses Diana Cooper and Nancy Cunard - revealing them as bawdy souls with penchants for cocaine, lesbian affairs and all-night sex sessions.

Paris. Photography by d'Ora, around 1931, left, and the cover of the movie tie-in edition of The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald . Flappers: Six Women Of A Dangerous Generation by Judith Mackrell follows the lives of a handful of these international women who, between them, exemplified the daring nature and extreme depths of their generation's spirit. Zelda, the colourful American wife of Gatsby author Scott Fitzgerald; American dancer Josephine Baker; Paris-based Polish artist Tamara de Lempicka; American actress Tallulah Bankhead and English aristocrats Diana Cooper and Nancy Cunard each feature in chapters dedicated to their lives. The book divulges intimate details of Tallulah's various lesbian experiments and affairs with young female admirers and more mature women alike, and describes how difficult it was to feel bad about using cocaine to lift the spirit when the substance was so easy to acquire. Carey Mulligan as society girl Daisy Buchanan in Baz Luhrmann's new film remake of F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel The Great Gatsby . The jazz-age actress, who starved determinedly to achieve her waifish look, frequently quipped a phrase by which she and so many of her peers lived by: 'My father warned me about men and booze, but he never mentioned a word about women and cocaine.' Author Judith Mackrell, an acclaimed dance critic, reveals Tamara de Lempicka to be a lesbian, free to discover the possibilities of her motivations in the liberal age of the Twenties, and especially in Paris. The glamorous artist of Polish origin would snort cocaine from a silver teaspoon allowing her to stay up all night having sex or painting. In a heady mix of epicureanism and dismay, Mackrell writes of how Nancy Cunard's penchant for French affairs acted as remedy for despair at life's tragedies, and of Zelda Fitzgerald's heavy alcohol consumption and taste for morphine. 1920s Poster for The Original Charleston, Starring Josephine Baker .

"Have you ever experienced deeply pleasurable, distinctly non-sexual tingles that begin in the back of your head and spread down throughout your body and limbs, triggered by certain sounds, physical sensations such as someone cutting your hair or even watching someone complete mundane tasks such as diligently filling in paperwork? If you have, you are experiencing what is being referred to as ASMR, or Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response, or head orgasms, head tingles, 'AIHO' (attention-induced head orgasm), 'AIE' (attention-induced euphoria). ASMR is a recently discovered phenomenon, that like so many others, came to light through the internet and now has its own dedicated fan-base, research page and soon, the first scientific study looking into brain patterns of people experiencing ASMR. Scroll down for video . Tingly: The sounds and sensations of a haircut are a trigger for many who experience Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response . The ASMR Facebook page, which has 5,417 members, describes the phenomenon as 'a pleasant, often intense tingling sensation that begins in the head and travels down the body to varying extents.' 'It is often accompanied by a euphoric feeling, and can overwhelm the experiencer of a particularly strong ASMR event. Some ASMR experiencers are triggered from an uncontrolled external stimulus; other experiencers can control an ASMR event through conscious thought triggers.' A quick YouTube search for AMSR turns up thousands of videos. Most commonly, they are young women, speaking in soft, whispery monotones about nothing in particular. Birds of a feather: ASMR proponent 'Heather Feather' brushes her hair for hours for the listening pleasure of the ASMR community . One particularly interminable one made by 'Heather Feather' begins with a breathy explanation of what the viewer is about to see: Heather Feather brushing her hair while it's wet. Then, she plans to dry the hair, and then brush her hair while it's dry - all for your aural pleasure. The video goes for more than an hour and has 32,604 views. Another, made by theWaterWhispers and called Let Me Take Care of You, features a young woman in a maternal/nursemaid role, caressing the camera, speaking softly to it, and assuring it that it's going to be OK, and dabbing its fevered brow with a washcloth. For 13 minutes. One might expect such videos to be the object of ridicule, but it's just the opposite - people seem to let down their guard and let a stranger's soft whispers or the sound of someone brushing their hair comfort them. Margaret Bennett commented on Let Me Take Care of You: 'Thank you very much for﻿ making this; couldn't seem to wind down till I found this, and now I'm all tingly and warm... time to crawl into bed and finally sleep. I'll definately [sic] be poking around on your channel.' berecca123 said, 'This is by far my favorite video! Please do another similar because I could probably recite this due to how many﻿ times I've watched it haha. I LOVE the wet towel and the tucking in. It made me feel so cozy :) thanks a lot Xxxx.' Comfort: Ilse at theWaterWhispers dabs her camera's hot forehead with a a damp washcloth in the immensely popular Let Me Take Care of You video . The owner of theWaterWhispers channel, who refers to herself as Ilse in her videos, is a Dutch ASMR enthusiast who has a high standing in the AMSR community, such as it is. She's made 211 videos, which include 'Saleswoman role play - shoe shopping', where she pretends to sell you a pair of shoes, 'Relaxing chocolate tasting' and another where she talks - whispers - the viewer through her grandmother's jewellery collection. It's edge-of-your-seat stuff. But again, for the ASMR community, this stuff is like a drug. Sadah1986 wrote: 'I finally know I'm not the only one with tingly dealing if someone looks at thing or makes noises. I had it as a child an nobody understood... I finally know I'm not the only﻿ one.' Another commenter wrote that 11:40 was his favorite part of the jewelry video - featuring Ilse scraping her finger over an earring. In her videos she refers to herself as Ilse, but when she spoke to MPBN, she said her name was Maria. She said some of the subscribers to her videos include soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan. 'And they share with me how much they struggle with their nightmares that they get,' she said. 'And the ASMR whisper videos, they actually help them fall asleep better, which is amazing because they sometimes say medications don't work, but these videos work instead.' There are also 'unintentional' ASMR videos - instructional videos such as someone demonstrating Japanese bookbinding, making origami or, as many ASMR experiencers say, the late Bob Ross, whose combination of softly spoken words and demonstrating technique seems to push a lot of ASMR buttons. Unintentional: It's unlikely the maker of this instructional video had any idea it would be a trigger for ASMR . It's unlikely that AMSR is a new phenomenon. YouTube, Twitter and Facebook have changed the way people communicate and share ideas and information - there's a forum for everything and our tendency to 'overshare' online has created diverse interest communities. AMSR is the same - it began in 2009, a Yahoo! group called the Society of Sensationalists formed  'in hopes of finding people who experience the same sensation.' In 2010 Andrew MacMuiris started a blog called The Unnamed Feeling, on which is a timeline of ASMR. That same year  Jenn Allen, who founded the site asmr-research.org site, and coined the term AMSR. After that point, the timeline becomes crowded with events, media attention and group meetings. In September 2012 an ASMR app was released for Apple iOS. So where to next for the mysterious ASMR and its devoted community? After Wikipedia took down its ASMR page because it lacked any peer-reviewed research or even proof, a Reddit user and Dartmouth College undergrad Bryson Lochte announced that he plans to perform brain scans to study it for his thesis. Lochte plans to release his preliminary discoveries on ASMR in the next few months. We're tingling with anticipation.","A new phenomenon has been identified as Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response, or head orgasms .

"NAACP convention currently being held in central Florida . Eric Holder, who is speaking on Tuesday at the convention, called Trayvon's death a 'tragic, unnecessary shooting' on Monday . FBI report on The Smoking Gun describes Zimmerman not as a racist but as suffering a 'hero complex' It may be mere coincidence that the NAACP's annual convention is being held in central Florida, but the organization is making the most of it by issuing rallying cries and demanding 'justice' for Trayvon Martin. The self-defense 'not guilty' verdict of George Zimmerman, who shot and killed the unarmed black teen in February 2012, was delivered less than 30 miles from the convention site in Orlando. And speakers made sure the hundreds of assembled NAACP members knew that federal charges against the exonerated Zimmerman were among the group's top priorities. Describing the events in nearby Sanford, Florida as a sign that African-Americans face 'times of great peril,' NAACP president Benjamin Jealous said that blacks 'feel it every time we see one of our young sons ... walk out the door and pull his hoodie up.' Scroll down for video . Benjamin Jealous, president of the NAACP, has presided over an organization-wide outcry over Zimmerman's acquittal by a jury in Sanford, Florida . Attorney General Eric Holder said Monday that Trayvon Martin's death was a 'tragic, unnecessary shooting.' The NAACP is demanding that he file federal civil rights charges against George Zimmerman. Holder will speak at the NAACP convention on Tuesday . In this undated photo, Trayvon Martin (L) is embraced by his father Tracy (R). The teen died on February 26, 2012 following a confrontation with neighborhood watch captain George Zimmerman . The Orlando Sentinel reported that Jealous told reporters after his keynote speech Monday that when he heard the verdict read, live on television, 'the first thing I did was walk over to my son's crib and lift him up and I listened to him breathe. And then I began to cry.' SiriusXM radio host Joe Madison, known to his fans as 'The Black Eagle,' lashed out at Zimmerman and the court that allowed him to walk free. Trayvon Martin's death, he said, was 'nothing more than a modern day lynching. George Zimmerman became the judge, jury and executioner.' Attorney General Eric Holder will address the convention on Tuesday. The NAACP has collected nearly 300,000 signatures on a petition asking him to prosecute Zimmerman under federal civil rights law, an outcome that could become a reality despite the U.S. Constitution's protections against double jeopardy. 'We will update you as we work to pursue civil rights charges against Zimmerman through the DOJ,' the NAACP tweeted shortly after the verdict was read on Saturday night. An FBI document published Monday on the website The Smoking Gun shows that in the week following the 2012 shooting a Sanford, Fla. police detective 'described Zimmerman as overzealous and as having ""a little hero complex,"" but not as a racist.' Hundreds of NAACP leaders cheered Benjamin Jealous' call for federal charges from the Justice Department . Some protesters confronted police lines, like this one in Los Angeles, California, after Zimmerman was acquitted, despite civil rights leaders' calls for calm and peaceful protests . Benjamin Crump, who represents the Martin family and is expected to file a wrongful death lawsuit against Zimmerman on their behalf, told the crowd that that they should 'refuse to remain silent because Sabrina [Fulton] and Tracy cannot do this by themselves.' SiriusXM host Joe Madison said Martin's death was 'nothing more than a modern day lynching. George Zimmerman became the judge, jury and executioner' 'If anything good is to come' from Saturday night's verdict, national NAACP spokesman Eric Wingerter told the Sentinel, 'this is the time to build a movement.' 'This goes to the heart of what racial profiling is - in this case, the idea that a young black teenager is by definition a thug instead of a son just visiting his father.' Majic 102.1, a radio station in Houston, Texas, reported Monday that within hours of the trial's conclusion, NAACP leaders called an 'emergency meeting,' during which the group's national youth and college director encouraged members to 'effective[ly] get justice for Trayvon.' A rally held Sunday outside Houston’s justice court, and other demonstrations like it, was planned at that Orlando gathering. NAACP Chairman Roslyn Brock told WKMG-TV6 in Orlando that NAACP members 'can't get to how you walk home in the rain from a local convenience store to being dead on the ground.' 'Our community was prepared for a manslaughter conviction, we would accept that, but to have Mr. Zimmerman exonerated of all charges?' Mark O' Mara, George Zimmerman's attorney, continues to insist that his client 'was never guilty of anything except protecting himself in self-defense.' An iconic 'hoodie' photo from Trayvon Martin's cell phone has become a rallying point among black activists who insist the slain teen was gunned down without justification. But Zimmerman's injuries supported his claim that Martin was the aggressor, slamming his head against a concrete sidewalk as their fight escalated .","NAACP convention currently being held in central Florida .

"When shop owner Lucy Wilkes decided on a window display for her business, she knew it would ruffle a few feathers. Two vintage, kitsch chairs, standing side-by-side and decorated in pages from Playboy magazines, one of which featured nude women. However, even she was astonished at the level of controversy the saucy display attracted among visitors to her shop The Print Room, in Lewes, East Sussex. Public outrage: Designer Laura Diez with her offending Playboy chair at the gallery in Lewes, east Sussex . Near the mark: Officers told Mrs Wilkes her £95 vintage furniture contravened the Obscene Publications Act because it is decorated with 1950s Playboy magazines . She was stunned when police ordered her to remove one of the offending items after a customer complained that it was 'obscene'. Officers told Mrs Wilkes her £95 vintage furniture contravened the Obscene Publications Act because it is decorated with 1950s Playboy magazines, which features images of topless women. The astonished retailer was forced to hide the saucy seat at the back of her shop and has now draped it with a public health warning. The ironic sign reads: 'This chair has been deemed inappropriate for public view. Please take care.' Designer Laura Diez, who made the chair, insisted her creation was 'tasteful'. She said: 'I can’t believe anyone in their right mind could actually be offended by this. 'I used 1950s Playboys which are no more scandalous than the front cover of some men’s magazines which are on show in any newsagents. Not suitable for public display: Ms Diez with her chair outside the shop in Lewes, east Sussex . 'It was supposed to be a little provocative but I certainly wasn’t setting out to shock anyone and I’m amazed anyone complained.' Mrs Wilkes said her husband was running her shop, called The Print Room, when police told him to remove the chair last week. She said: 'We have had almost entirely positive comments from people apart from one woman who thought it was inappropriate. 'I knew we couldn’t please everybody but then my husband called when I was away from the shop and said he had the police there. 'They said we had to take the chair out of the window because of the Obscene Publications Act. It’s quite hard to know how to respond to that, so I made light of it. 'It was certainly never intended to shock. It’s vintage kitsch.' A Sussex Police spokeswoman said: 'Police attended a Lewes shop following a complaint from a member of the public regarding an item that was on display in the shop window. 'The member of public was offended by the images displayed on a chair and the shop owner was politely asked by police to remove it from public view, which he voluntarily did.'","Vintage kitsch chair decorated in pages from Playboy magazine, featuring topless women .

"Two Nato troops have been killed in southern Afghanistan on a day of violence in the war-torn country that also saw a rogue policeman shoot dead nine sleeping officers. One Nato service member died in a . roadside bomb explosion this morning and the other in an insurgent . attack yesterday. No further details were disclosed, but the deaths bring the number of international troops killed in Afghanistan so far this year to 88. On patrol: German soldiers walk through a street in the province of Kunduz yesterday. Two Nato troops have been killed in Afghanistan in the last 24 hours - one died in a roadside bomb explosion this morning and the other in an insurgent attack yesterday . A suspected U.S. drone fired two missiles at a house in north-west Pakistan this morning, killing four militants. Protest: Demonstrators burn mock U.S. and Nato flasg as they shout slogans against the resumption of the supply route to Nato forces in Afghanistan in Multan on Wednesday . The attack comes as Pakistani officials have stepped up their calls for the strikes to end, intelligence officials said. It could complicate U.S. efforts to get Pakistan to reopen its border crossings to supplies meant for Nato troops in Afghanistan. Pakistan shut the border last November in retaliation for American airstrikes that killed 24 Pakistani soldiers. The country's parliament is debating a revised framework for its relationship with the U.S. that Washington hopes will result in Nato supply routes reopening. But a key demand is that the U.S. stop drone attacks, which are very unpopular in Pakistan because many people believe they mostly kill civilians - a claim denied by the U.S. and contradicted by independent research. Today's strike targeted a house in Miran Shah, the main town in the North Waziristan tribal area, a key sanctuary for Taliban and al-Qaida militants, Pakistani intelligence officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The four militants killed in the strike and three wounded were from Uzbekistan, said the officials. Their precise identities were unclear but the attack occurred while the group was sleeping. In the eastern Paktika province, an . Afghan policeman killed nine of his fellow officers as they slept in the . early hours of this morning. Local police blamed the attack, which took place in the town of Yayakhi, on the Taliban. The province's police chief Dawlat Khan Zadran identified the gunman as Asadullah, who goes by one name. Bowal Khan, the district's chief, said the shooter was assigned to a small command post when he woke up at 3am for guard duty. He then used his assault rifle to . kill the nine men sleeping inside the post, took their weapons and piled . them in a pickup truck. According to Mr Khan, Asadullah then sped away in the truck. The victims included one of his . brothers and the commander of the post, identified as Mohammad Ramazan. Two of the dead were Ramazan's sons. The motive for the killing was not known, but police in the area blamed the Taliban for the attack. Paktikan is a stronghold of the Haqqani network, a Pakistani-based group with ties to the Taliban and Al-Qaeda. Although they mostly attack U.S.-led coalition forces, they have often carried out assaults and bombings against the Afghan army and police. Mr Zadran said: 'This man is a coward. What he did is part of the Taliban conspiracy.' The killer's two brothers are being held for questioning. The village police is also known as . the Afghan Local Police, or ALP. It is a village-level force that . provides security in areas where the Afghan army and police cannot.

"The federal government pays for a $15 million 'wool trust fund,' runs a $170 million program to protect catfish growers from overseas competition, sets aside $3 million to promote Christmas trees, funds another $2 million to help farmers sell more sheep, and plunks down $100 million researching how to get Americans to buy more maple syrup. And that spending is just three one-hundredths of one per cent of the Farm Bill that President Barack Obama signed Friday in Michigan. Liberal and conservative watchdogs alike are hopping mad at what they say are pork-barrel projects included in the five-year agriculture spending law as home-state perks to lawmakers that are  unneeded or redundant. There's a new 15-cent levy on every live-cut Christmas tree, a proposal that Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack had blocked but will now be beyond his control. Tree growers will put the money into a fund for 'industry-funded promotion, research, and information program[s],' but the cost will inevitably be passed on to consumers. A table made from a pork barrel? Obama signed the nearly $1 trillion Farm Bill in Michigan on Friday . Like maple syrup on your stack? The feds will plunk down $100 million in the coming years to help the industry lure more breakfast eaters . The Farm Bill also includes $1 million in grant money to buy weather radios, despite the ubiquity of weather.com and the plummeting costs of both Internet service and smartphones. And it continues a $200 million 'market access' program that has paid companies like Fruit of the Loom and McDonalds to run commercials. One grant from that fund even funded a reality TV show in India aimed at promoting cotton. Another paid Welch's $844,000 to hawk grape juice outside the U.S. The conservative Club For Growth called the legislation, which took members of Congress three years to write, 'a ""Christmas Tree"" bill where there’s a gift for practically every special interest group out there with a well-connected lobbyist.' It's $956 billion of spending overall in a ten-year period, sketched out in legislation 959 pages long – nearly $1 billion per page. But most of that money goes to food-stamp and nutrition programs, which are administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The 10-year spending total for those entitlements will hit $756 billion under the new law. Get ready to pay more: Christmas tree growers will put millions into a Farm Bill-approved fund to hep them with marketing, with consumers likely footing the bill in the form of higher prices . Food stamp costs make up most of the Farm Bill -- more than 80 per cent . Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack (R) had blocked the Christmas tree tax in the past, but is now powerless to stop it . That amount is $8.7 billion less than the previous Farm Bill included, but trends suggest it may have to be revised. Since President Obama took office, the number of Americans receiving those benefits has nearly doubled. One in five American households receive food stamps today. More than 1 million people were added to the rolls in 2013, including residents who live in the country illegally. In the year 2000 the entire food stamp program cost $17 billion. Last year that figure was $78 billion. The rest of the Farm Bill, all $200 billion of it, includes some subsidy payments to members of Congress and their families who are engaged in agriculture. The left-leaning Environmental Working Group reports that in 2013, In 2013, more than $237,000 was paid to federal lawmakers and their spouses. All but two were Republicans. Still, Democrats scuttled a bipartisan House amendment that would have required public disclosure of such payments. North Carolina Republican Rep Virginia Foxx and Minnesota Democratic Rep. Keith Ellison pushed the transparency tweak unsuccessfully last year. Also on some watchdogs' lists of Farm Bill waste is an estimated $1 billion per year taxpayers lend out to protect the sugar industry against price fluctuations, shielding it – mostly in the form of just three companies – from being undercut by cheaper imported sugar. The result also raises sugar prices nationwide. How much in taxes? Baaaah! The U.S. sheep industry is thriving, but taxpayers will shell out $2 million to help ranchers sell even more . Back to Washington! Obama signed the Farm Bill in front of John Deere tractors, representing the big agribusinesses that will largely benefit from the new spending law . 'By keeping an unnecessary catfish inspection program and refusing to reform crop insurance or eliminate the unnecessary sugar program, members of both parties and both chambers missed a golden opportunity to fundamentally shift agriculture policy from government-centric to one that embraces the free market and common sense,' said David Williams, president of the Taxpayers Protection Alliance.' And the left-leaning Citizens Against Government Waste is no more enamored with the final law. 'The bill is a disaster for taxpayers and has the potential to be even more expensive and wasteful than the abysmal 2008 Farm Bill that it is replacing,' the group's president, Tom Schatz, complained. Obama signed it into law at Michigan State University alongside Michigan Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow. He called it a 'Swiss Army knife,' with something for everyone, including the catfish lobby. Taxpayer lobby groups failed to cut that industry's hand-out from the Farm Bill, despite pointing out that there's already a similar program funded by the Food and Drug Administration.","The massive five-years agriculture spending plan, signed Friday by President Obama, includes a $3 million plan for Christmas tree taxes .

"Online love scammers have stolen more than $25 million from Australians in just one year, prompting the consumer watchdog to join forces with government anti-money laundering agents in a bid to crack down. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) will start sending about 400 letters every fortnight to suspected victims of online dating scams with warnings to stop sending money. Recipients will be identified if suspicious cross-border money movements are flagged with anti-money laundering agents as part of the new scam distribution project. Scroll down for video . Online love scammers have stolen more than $25 million from Australians in just one year, prompting the consumer watchdog to join forces with government anti-money laundering agents . There was a staggering $89 million in financial losses from scams last year, with dating and romance topping the list at more than $25 million, the ACCC found. There were close to 3,000 reports of relationship scams in 2013, with one third of people losing more than $10,000. ACCC Deputy Chair Delia Rickard said the aim was to disrupt the scam and therefore remove victims from scammers’ insidious clutches. 'Scammers invest considerable time and effort deceiving you into a fake romance, a fraudulent business partnership or a complex investment scheme. Their ultimate aim is to build your trust so they can steal your personal details and money,' she said. 'Victims of relationship scams often don’t know they’re a victim until it’s too late and their money is gone forever.' ACCC Deputy Chair Delia Rickard said the aim was to disrupt the scam and therefore remove victims from scammers' insidious clutches . 1. You’ve never met or seen them: scammers will say anything to avoid a ‘face-to-face’ meeting. 2.  They’re not who they appear to be: scammers steal photos and profiles from real people to create an appealing facade. 3.  They ask to chat with you privately: as many dating sites have processes in place to identify and remove scammers, . 4. You don’t know a lot about them: scammers are often less forthcoming about themselves. 5. They ask you for money:  once the connection’s been made - scammers will eventually ask you to transfer money. Raising awareness has been touted as the key to helping Australians protect themselves better, which is another important aspect of the project. 'People should be particularly vigilant in asking themselves who they are really dealing with when they meet the person online,' Ms Rickard said. 'Scammers use the internet to establish relationships behind a smoke screen, where they remain anonymous while connecting with potential victims around the globe. 'Alarm bells should go off if they request money, especially via wire transfer. This payment method is popular with scammers as it is almost impossible to trace and it is rare to recover money sent this way. 'If you suspect that you, a friend or a family member is being targeted by a scammer, the ACCC strongly urges you to stop sending any money and to contact us.' An Australian grandmother, whose online friendship cost her more than her lifesavings, met a tragic fate at the hands of a love scammer. Jette Jacobs flew to South Africa believing she was starting a new relationship with a 28-year-old man, but days after meeting him she was found dead in her apartment, 60 Minutes reported. The ACCC said it was working with state and federal counterparts on the project through the Australasian Consumer Fraud Taskforce. The taskforce comprises of 23 government regulatory agencies and departments with responsibility for consumer protection regarding frauds and scams.","Australian consumer watchdog will start sending letters to suspected victims of online dating scams .

"A city worker whose nose was bitten off during a nightclub attack has described the incident 'like something from Tyson v Holyfield'. Christopher Woolcott, 32, was at the Babble Club with friends when a row broke out with another group over a spilt drink. The Old Bailey heard that Johnathan Ball, 26, sank his teeth into Mr Woolcott’s face at the Babble Club in the City of London. Scroll down for video . Johnathan Ball, 26, has been jailed for almost two years following the attack on February 24, 2013 . He bit through cartilage and flesh, tearing off the front part of Mr Woolcott's nose and leaving him bleeding and needing skin grafts to repair the damage. The attack has been described as one of 'real savagery.' On the night of February 24, 2013, Mr Woolcott was in the club with his friends near Ball and a group of his friends. At one stage during a night a drink was knocked over and a row broke out. Bouncers broke up the fight, but Ball broke free and took a running jump at Mr Woolcott, clamping his nose between his teeth. Mr Woolcott told the Evening Standard: 'It was only when I felt his teeth touching each other that I realised what he did. They just closed around the top of my nose, he bit it off and spat it out. It was like Mike Tyson on Evander Holyfield.' The incident took place at Babble Club cocktail bar in London last February when both men were with friends . Mr Woolcott required more than five hours of reconstructive surgery as doctors removed skin from behind his ear to rebuild his nose. Property broker, Mr Woolcott, who lives in south-east London said: 'One of the reasons I pursued this in court was to help the police and to stop this guy doing the same thing again. Biting is clearly his trademark as he has bitten two police officers in the past. 'Prison for 20 months isn't harsh, but he will be separated from his family and will have time to think about what he's done. Luckily, even with half my nose bitten off, I was able to find a nice girlfriend.' CCTV footage recorded on February 24 last year showed both Ball and Mr Woolcott were enjoying themselves with their own group of friends on the dance floor of the city club. But a scuffle broke out after a drink was spilt and Ball grabbed hold of his victim’s head, got him on the floor and sank his teeth into the front part of his nose. Johnathan Ball (left) was jailed by Judge Charles Wide (right) who said the crime was vicious and serious . Judge Charles Wide QC said the crime was ‘vicious and serious’ and told Ball: ‘You must have had part of his nose in your mouth after you bit him.’ Ball was convicted of causing grievous bodily harm after a retrial. He was sentenced to 20 months in prison and an additional four weeks in jail after an earlier suspended sentence was activated. In August 2006, Ball was convicted of assaulting two police officers, after biting both of them. He also has a conviction for battery on another officer and numerous other drug-related offences, the court heard. Mark Gadsden said the fight appeared to start after a drink was spilt and the situation then 'deteriorated rapidly.' He described the incident as an act of 'real savagery.' The pair had to be pulled apart by security guards. Ajay Malik, a security guard, was one of the workers who separated the men. ‘I picked the other guy up and supported him and saw he was bleeding from the face,’ he said. ‘He was bleeding quite badly from the nose. ‘I took him downstairs for medical assistance.’ Mr Malik said when he went back upstairs to look for Ball he found him ‘hiding’ in a booth with his friends. ‘I found the guy, he was sweating and had marks on his face so I felt it was the right man,’ he added. ‘I asked him quite politely to come out because I wanted to speak to him but he wouldn’t. ‘I asked him once or twice but he wouldn’t come out.' Mr Malik said Ball also asked him if the police were coming. Ball initially told police that the attack was carried out by somebody else but later accepted he was responsible for the injury and claims he acted in self defence. He told the court he bit off the man’s nose to defend himself when the trader tried to gouge his eye out. ‘I was like a sheep surrounded by wolves,’ sobbed Ball, who is 6ft 2 and weighs over 17 stone. Mike Tyson was trying to rebuild his career when he secured a rematch against Evander Holyfield on June 28, 1997. During the third round the fight was stopped after Tyson bit through the top section of Holyfield's right ear. Tyson became the youngest ever heavyweight world champion in 1986, aged just 19.

In 1990 he was beaten by James 'Buster' Douglas in a major upset. This was followed by a conviction for rape in 1992 and a three year jail term. In 1996 Holyfield shocked Tyson, defeating him on November 9, defeating him in the 11th round. The following year, the pair had a much anticipated rematch. Tyson bit Holyfield's left ear, early in Round 3. He then bit through Holyfield's right ear, spitting out amputated section on the canvas.","Christopher Woolcott had part of his nose bitten off after the attack .

"Real Madrid star Sergio Ramos admits he has played under some 'fantastic' coaches during his career but hinted that Jose Mourinho wasn't one of them. The pair fell out during the Portuguese manager's reign in the Spanish capital, with Ramos unimpressed with the way Mourinho treated certain members of the squad. The feud has continued despite the pair being apart for over a year now, and Ramos was keen to explain some of the ways that Real had benefited from a change of coach.

'When there’s such a mix of everything you have to know how to handle it very well. (Carlo) Ancelotti is very important in this. 'He notices how a player settles in, whether he makes an effort to open up to his team-mates or not. He’s a coach who takes you aside, talks to you and makes everything as smooth as possible, both on a professional and personal level. 'That’s the key to success, which is why he’s a truly great coach. In my view, he’s one of the two best I’ve had in my whole career.' When asked who the other coach was, Ramos said: 'Wow, that’s a hard one.

"Concerns: French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius questioned Romania and Bulgaria's ability to police their borders . France's foreign minister said last night that Romanians  and Bulgarians should be prevented from travelling around Europe freely. Laurent Fabius is the second senior minister to call for restrictions. He said there were serious security worries about criminals using the two impoverished countries as a way into other parts of the EU. Referring to the Schengen Agreement, which allows people to move across 26 European countries without passport checks, Mr Fabius said: ‘If there is not a change in conditions, we won’t be in favour. ‘People coming from outside Europe could enter Romania and Bulgaria and then freely enter the rest of Europe.’ Bulgaria and Romania will join the so-called Schengen Zone next year, giving their citizens free movement. His comments follow a call last week by interior minister Manuel Valls for all Roma gipsies to ‘return to Romania or Bulgaria’ because they are unable to integrate. Their warnings about the failure of European ‘open border’ immigration policies echo concerns in the UK, as Britain prepares to let in thousands of Romanians and Bulgarians looking for work in 2014. This summer, police blamed dozens of Romanian gipsies camped in London’s Park Lane for a surge in begging, pickpocketing and shoplifting. Each EU country can veto the admission of a member state into the zone. A vote is expected this year, and Germany says it will oppose the entry of Romania and Bulgaria. Flashpoint: French police expel Romas from their camp, in Villeneuve d'Ascq, northern France, last year . Temporary restrictions that imposed passport checks were put in place when the two countries joined the EU in 2007, and are due to be lifted in January. But each EU country has the right to veto the admission of a member state into the Schengen zone and a vote is expected before the end of the year. Last week, Interior Minister Manuel Valls caused uproar in the left-wing governing coalition by saying most immigrant Roma 'don’t integrate well in France'. The European Commission immediately threatened sanctions against France for its policy towards the Roma community. Tensions: France has clamped down on the Roma community, expelling thousands from camps across the country - including this one in the central French city of Villeurbanne, outside Lyon . Three years ago the Commission’s vice president, Viviane Reding, sent a similar threat to former president Nicolas Sarkozy, saying that Roma expulsions had to stop. The far-right National Front has made the issue a top campaign theme for March's municipal elections, warning of a new influx of immigrants if Romanian and Bulgarian citizens are allowed to travel freely without passports in the Schengen zone. In March Germany too vowed to oppose Romania and Bulgaria joining the Schengen passport-free zone. Interior minister Hans-Peter Friedrich warned both nations if they insist on entry into the scheme ‘Germany will veto it and they will fail’. The Netherlands also backs the ban. Britain is not signed up to the Schengen agreement. Germany is undergoing an invasion of immigrants from both countries with many cities experiencing extreme social tensions as a result. Meanwhile, a French court heard children as young as ten were part of a ‘criminal army’ of Roma immigrants run by a 66-year-old woman. Details . of the gang, which included 13-year-old wives allegedly ‘bought’ for up . to £170,000, emerged in the trial of 27 men and women in Nancy, eastern . France. All face up to ten years in jail after being accused of crimes . from robbery to people trafficking. Children . were said to be expected to bring in £4,000 pounds a month from . robberies.

"Harry Kane stole the show as Tottenham beat Arsenal 2-1 at White Hart Lane but both teams' playmakers also left their mark on the game. Arsene Wenger spoke before the north London derby about a desire for his team to play with lucidity. While most of his players struggled to achieve this, for one player on the White Hart Lane pitch the machinations of the game seemed clear. Mesut Ozil has started three games since returning from injury, in all three he played on the left, in all three he scored. Mesut Ozil watches as his volley beats Hugo Lloris to find the back of the net early in the first half . The World Cup-winner wheels away in celebration after giving Arsenal the lead . Christian Eriksen battles with Hector Bellerin and Danny Welbeck during the north London derby . While the in-form Santi Cazorla failed to have a significant impact on the game, his German team-mate wasted no time influencing the match. With 11 minutes gone, Danny Welbeck crossed for Olivier Giroud, the Frenchman scuffed his shot but Ozil had lost Kyle Walker at the back post and calmly volleyed into the back of the net. To suggest Ozil had anticipated his team-mate's mistake would be a hard sell but that shouldn't detract from his opener. One of his strengths is his ability to find space - whether he's playing in the centre or on the left - and it was that ability that earned him the goal. But from there on Arsenal retreated and it was his opposite number that took control. Tottenham's Danish playmaker is tackled by Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey .

Christian Eriksen - who arrived just in north London just two days before Ozil in 2013 - has enjoyed, statistically, a more impressive season so far. And while the former Ajax man failed to add to his tally of 11 goals for the season, he played a crucial role as Tottenham dominated possession. He spent most of the first half on the left attempting to exploit weaknesses in full back Hector Bellerin's game. His presence caused problems for the La Masia graduate but Spurs ended the half trailing. The second half was a different story. Spurs dominated from the off, and Eriksen played a huge part in that. His passing may not have possessed its normal accuracy but Eriksen but he covered a huge amount of ground throughout the game, and only one offensive midfielder or forward won more duels than him during the match. Eriksen (48) made almost double the amount of passes as Ozil (25) during the clash, won more duels, and made more recoveries. The Arsenal man was, though, more clinical. He scored with his only shot of the game and had superior pass accuracy throughout. Former Real Madrid midfielder Ozil protects the ball from Argentine Erik Lamela .

"When we first make contact with aliens, they won't be toothy horrors from beyond the void, obsessed with eating or enslaving the human race, says one of Earth's most seasoned alien-hunters. The technological challenges involved in faster-than-light travel would mean that the aliens were so hi-tech they would have no need for slaves, and would probably have their own ways of manufacturing food. ‘Often the aliens of science fiction say more about us than they do about themselves,’ said Jill Tarter, who announced on May 22nd that she was stepping down as Director of the Center for SETI (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) Research. Michael Fassbender in trailer for Ridley Scott movie Prometheus: But when we first make contact with aliens, they won't be toothy horrors from beyond the void, obsessed with eating or enslaving the human race, says one of Earth's most seasoned alien-hunters . Sigourney Weaver confronts the alien in Alien 3: The technological challenges involved in faster-than-light travel would mean that the aliens were so hi-tech they would be unlikely to view us as food or incubators for their young . Tarter is to continue her research into aliens even after retirement, but she has headed Earth's search for radio signals from space for 35 years. ‘While Sir Stephen Hawking warned that alien life might try to conquer or colonize Earth, I respectfully disagree,' says Tarter. 'If aliens were able to visit Earth that would mean they would have technological capabilities sophisticated enough not to need slaves, food, or other planets. 'If aliens were to come here it would be simply to explore.  Considering the age of the Universe, we probably wouldn’t be their first extraterrestrial encounter, either. 'We should look at movies like ‘Men in Black III,’ ‘Prometheus’ and ‘Battleship’ as great entertainment and metaphors for our own fears, but we should not consider them harbingers of alien visitation.’ War of the Worlds: But the technological challenges of interstellar travel will mean that aliens who meet us would be explorers, rather than conquerors . Aliens are exceptionally well represented at the local multiplex this spring. Hostile invaders, tipped off by an overly enthusiastic broadcast from Earth, try to sink a lot of naval hardware in ‘Battleship;’ domestic extraterrestrials give headaches to urbane government agents in ‘Men in Black III;’ and fans of the ‘Alien’ films finally get the back story of Ridley Scott’s toothy terror in the famous director’s prequel, ‘Prometheus.’ SETI Institute astronomer Seth Shostak has been a consultant on ‘Battleship,’ ‘Green Hornet,’ and ‘The Day the Earth Stood Still,’ as well as other films. Frequently, the creative folks simply want your help in solving a script problem – for example, what sort of weaponry might an alien society commandeer,’ says Shostak.  ‘On other occasions, they just want some technical corrections to dialog.  But the really interesting challenge is to introduce these people to some of the newer ideas in science – ideas that aren’t yet hackneyed.’ ‘Ours is the one conference where the public can rub elbows with the innovators and leaders in the quest to find life in the universe,’ said Andrew Fraknoi, SETI Institute Trustee and Foothill College Astronomy Professor.  ‘It’s where ideas that sounded like science fiction just a few years ago become part of today’s reality.’","Challenge of interstellar travel means aliens will be too advanced to need food or slaves .

"From sold-out gadgets to discarded cheese sandwiches, there's nothing that can't be found on eBay. And as the UK website celebrates its 15th birthday, three savvy sellers have spoken of how it made them millionaires. Mark Radcliffe, Anthony Ponsford and Alison Abruneiras are among the thousands of British eBay millionaires who made their fortunes trading on the site. Scroll down for video . Mark Radcliffe was the first British eBay millionaire after setting up First2Save in 1999 from his parents' garden shed . Alison Abruneiras and Anthony Ponsford have also made more than £1million by trading with independent retailers online . Selling coveted goods at fixed prices, the entrepreneurs are among millions of online stores which transformed the site from an auctioneers to a virtual marketplace. The first Brit to make £1million from eBay sales was Mark Radcliffe, a former Tesco shelf-stacker from Stockport, Manchester. The 35-year-old put aside £200 from his wages to launch First2Save - a one stop eBay shop for mobile phones and technological accessories. Fifteen years after starting the business from his parents' garden shed, the businessman said he owes everything to the website. 'I could have continued working at Tesco and become a manager but it would not have stretched me. 'I still have to pinch myself - it's a dream come true,' he told the Sun. Speaking on the 10th anniversary of his company's launch, Mr Radcliffe said anyone was capable of accomplishing what he had with the right knowledge and skills. 'I couldn't have got where I am today without the right people to help. Also being aware of the latest technology has always been important,' 'First2save has come a long way in ten years and it's astonishing what we've managed to achieve.

Her daughter Coralia (left) now works for the eBay shop, while she runs a tapas restaurant with her husband Amador (right) next to their home . Piranha Trading Limited warehouse is inspected after being set up by Anthony Ponsford and his partner . 'The internet means that virtually anyone can succeed in business from a low start-up point. All it takes is a lot of hard work and determination.' Anthony Ponsford abandoned his job as a city lawyer to start his wheeler-dealer business, Piranha Trading Limited. Among items on sale are camera memory cards, bric-a-brac desks and pet furniture from China. The 44-year-old of Shepperton, London, describes himself as the real-life Del Boy. 'I often joke to people that I've basically set up an online version of Trotter's Independent Traders,' he said. 'It started out, as many things do, as a very small enterprise turning over a very marginal profit for quite some time. 'I have to admit my heart sank when the bottom fell out of the market during the recession. 'When Lehman Brothers collapsed and the value of the pound dropped 40 per cent against the dollar I was fully expecting the business to fold.

"Abigail Gibbs has secured a six-figure book contract after writing The Dark Heroine, a Twilight-inspired novel which she started aged just 14 . A teenager has secured a six-figure sum for a vampire novel she wrote after being inspired by the Twilight saga. Abigail Gibbs, 18, who started writing the book aged 14, released chapters of her novel online, where the book eventually received 17 million hits. HarperCollins in Britain and America have now signed the talented author following her phenomenal internet success. Miss Gibbs, from Brixham, Devon, who is about to start studying English at Oxford University, is the first author to be discovered on Wattpad. Wattpad is an online writing platform which allows subscribers to upload or read other people's stories. Miss Gibbs said Stephenie Meyer's famous Twilight books had influenced her novel, The Dark Heroine. She said: 'I read the Twilight saga and did really enjoy it. I loved the romantic element between the human and the vampire. 'I wanted to do something like that . but it wasn't bloody and edgy enough for me so I thought I would sit . down and do my own thing and that's what I did. 'At first, my parents were a bit . opposed to me writing the book because I was staying up till 3am on . school nights and they were worried about me falling behind.' Miss Gibbs finished her book at the age of 16, just two years after she started writing it and it will now hit the high street. She posted each chapter after she had written it on the internet site, until she got to five chapters before the end when she stopped. She said: 'I stopped because I had signed with an agent and he basically said don't post anymore or the ending to keep readers in suspense. 'That was tough because I disappeared off the site for a year and there were a lot of fans asking where I was. 'There was a lot of temptation to tell them but I kept it all up in wraps. 'I have had so many requests from fans to upload the last five chapters, some people even said they were going to write their own ending.' Her fans can buy the ebook for £2.99, or wait for the paperback book priced at £6.99, in shops next month. Famous novel Twilight, left, inspired Miss Gibbs to write her vampire novel, right . The novel tells of 18-year-old Violet Lee witnessing a horrific mass murder in Trafalgar Square before being kidnapped into a dark world of vampires. The teenager puts her success down to the feedback she has had from her readers. She said: 'A lot of the readers were demanding more, they wanted a lot more uploads. 'Some of them were saying I should get it published so that was very encouraging and it helped when it came to my agent discovering me and going to agents having fans like that. 'I am completely shocked at where I am now. I started on Wattpad and that taking off was enough of a surprise. 'I took notice and realised that people really did like my work. After launching the book on Saturday night, in 24 hours it went from number 22,000 in the kindle chart to number 22. The ambitious writer has already started writing the sequel and hopes to see the book made into a film. She said: 'It is all very exciting at the moment and there will definitely be a sequel which I hope will come out next summer. 'I am halfway through it at the moment so that is great. 'To see my book in a cinema would be great, some fans are asking if I am going to get a movie deal but that is a long way off, although it would be great.' Kate Elton, publisher of HarperFiction said: 'The fact that she's writing something that feels British, with a genre that's traditionally been American, gives it an individual feel.'","Abigail Gibbs starting writing The Dark Heroine aged just 14 .

"More than 130 passengers who suffered severe diarrhoea, vomiting and stomach cramps on board nine separate trips have won a £280,000 settlement from the cruise operator. The passengers all fell ill while travelling aboard the Fred Olsen cruise liner, the Boudicca, on nine trips between October 2009 and May 2010. A spokesman for travel law specialists Irwin Mitchell, who handled the case on behalf of the passengers, said the cruise operator has agreed to settle the case without formally admitting liability for causing the passengers to fall ill. The cruise operator said the illness were down to a higher than usual number of cases of norovirus or winter vomiting virus among the UK population. More than 130 passengers have received a £280,000 settlement after falling ill aboard Fred Olsen's Boudicca cruise liner, pictured here in Kingstown Harbour in St Vincent and The Grenadines in 2011 . Luke and Emma Ryan from Petersfield in Hampshire booked a Christmas and New Year break on board the ship, with their five-year-old daughter Abigail. But Mr Ryan, 41, said their long-anticipated holiday soon turned into a nightmare. He said: 'It was a disaster. This was supposed to be a relaxing time for us to celebrate the festive period, so we couldn't believe it when I fell ill on Christmas Eve with nausea, stomach cramps and gastric symptoms. 'Instead of opening presents on Christmas morning, I had to be seen by a nurse. 'The . cruise was cut short by a day due to the illness and, to be frank, the . end could not have come soon enough. We hope this settlement will mean . we can now move on with our lives.' Clare Pearson, specialist illness lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, said: 'The fact that some of the passengers who suffered illness during and after trips on the Boudicca cruise ship in 2009 and 2010 still have continuing symptoms demonstrates the seriousness of what they have been through. 'Through our work, we have heard a range . of stories of how so many people’s breaks - which were often booked as . luxury once-in-a-lifetime trips to celebrate Christmas, wedding . anniversaries and birthdays - were ruined by illness. We are delighted for our clients that they have now received a fair settlement from Fred Olsen after enduring such terrible times on board the Boudicca. 'We hope that this outcome will allow our clients to look to the future and put the terrible problems they faced behind them, while we hope that it also acts as a reminder to cruise operators of the need to uphold the highest standards of safety and hygiene on board their ships.' A Fred Olsen spokeswoman said their clients 'may rest assured' that all their ships 'meet the highest standards of health, safety and hygiene at all times'. She said their fleet comply 'fully with the strict requirements and inspections of their flag state and relevant authorities'. The passengers fell ill on nine separate cruises between October 2009 and May 2010. The cruise operator settled but refused to admit liability for the illness, putting it down to an outbreak of norovirus in the UK . 'Fred Olsen Cruise Lines rejects any allegations made in the claim by Irwin Mitchell solicitors - as it has all along - regarding the standards of cleanliness and hygiene aboard its ships, which are of the highest standard across its fleet,' the spokeswoman said. 'In particular, Fred Olsen ensures that it upholds the most rigorous hygiene standards when preparing and serving food on board its ships, and refutes any allegations made by Irwin Mitchell to the contrary. 'Unfortunately, from October 2009 to May 2010, there was a higher incidence than usual of gastric illness, also known as ‘norovirus’, or ‘winter vomiting virus’, within communities in the United Kingdom, which is commonly identifiable in areas where people reside in close proximity. 'Most people do not report incidences, but on a cruise ship - where movement is restricted - cases are particularly highlighted. 'The virus - which is more contagious than the common cold, and is spread very easily by contact with surfaces and from person to person - is also particularly prevalent during periods of cold weather. 'Symptoms of the illness include a sudden onset of vomiting and/or diarrhoea; some people may have a temperature, headache and stomach cramps. Commonly, the illness abates within one or two days. 'It is frustrating that, even with . the extra preventative and containment measures that were put in place, a . number of guests on board these cruises were affected by this illness.' The . firm said all passnegers on board their cruises are made aware of the . importance of meticulous hygiene, are asked to complete a medical . questionnaire before embarking on their holiday and are reminded . regularly to make use of the hand sanitiser provided on board. In the event of an outbreak of gastric illness, the spokeswoman said the crews take every precaution to ensure the 'swift containment of the illness on board', resulting in the closure of a number of public areas, including all public toilets and the self-service buffet. She said frequent cleaning is undertaken and any guest showing signs of the illness are asked to stay in their cabin, with complimentary room service and entertainment, until they are considered to be symptom-free by the ship's doctor. 'At Fred Olsen Cruise Lines, the health, safety and well-being of all our guests and crew remains our utmost priority at all times, and we believe that our systems for preventing the spread of illness on board our ships are amongst the best within the industry,' the spokeswoman added. April 2013 . Monica Bounds, right, and Veronica Godfrey, left, were struck down by norovirus while on board the Fred Olsen liner the Boudicca . Monica Bounds was on board the Fred Olsen liner Boudicca when she was struck down by norovirus. She said her £900 getaway turned into a holiday from hell. Mrs Bounds branded the luxury liner a 'plague ship', riddled with the illness, which left numerous passengers 'quaratined' in cabins as crew wore masks and nuclear disaster-style suits. She claims staff were secretly placed on a ‘Code Red’ warning that forbade them to touch passengers. Many guests spent the trip suffering from vomiting and diarrhoea, she said. Fred Olsen said 61 of 732 passengers became ill on the voyage. Mrs Bounds spent much of her ten-day cruise isolated in her cabin, where her seriously ill friend Veronica Godfrey was on two drips hooked over a coathanger and hanging from a porthole. A spokesman for the cruise operator, said, at the time: 'Boudicca underwent an extensive ""deep clean"" and sanitising operation by independent specialist contractors before she embarked. 'It was extremley disappointing that, following these rigourous measures, the virus was brought back on the ship.'February 2013A Carnival cruise ship was stranded in the Gulf of Mexico after an engine fire broke out and crippled the power system. The ship's 3,143 passengers and 1,086 crew members were stuck on board the liner Triumph for days. Passengers reported how the four-day cruise turned into a nightmare, as carpets became soaked in urine and scarce food supplies left them with nothing to eat but cold sandwiches. Around 3,000 passengers aboard the Carnival cruise liner Triumph (pictured above) were left stranded after a fire broke out in the engine crippling the water and power system . The blow-out crippled the ship's water and power supply, with reports that only five bathrooms were working for all the passengers on board. One passenger said people were asked to urinate in cabin showers and defecate in bags.Ann Barlow said: 'It's disgusting. It's the worst thing ever.' And Debra Rightmire, added: 'Conditions are getting worse by the hour. Cabin carpets are wet with urine and water. 'Toilets are overflowing in the cabins , we are having to sleep in the hallways.'December 2012An outbreak of the winter vomiting virus hit passengers on board a P&O liner bound for the Christmas markets. Around 150 of the 2,000 passengers on board the Oriana were reported to have been taken ill in December 2012. An outbreak of norovirus plagued the P&O liner Oriana, when she set sail for a tour of the European Christmas markets in December 2012. Around 150 of the 2,000 passengers were reportedly taken ill . One passenger described the trip as the 'cruise from hell'. People started to fall ill within hours of the liner setting sail on December 4, 2012. It was bound for a tour of the festive markets in Zeebrugge, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Oslo and Hamburg. P&O said nine cases of norovirus were confirmed and added that enhanced sanitation protocols had been enacted.May 2012Around 170 passengers on board luxury cruise liner the Boudicca had their dream holidays ruined by sickness. The Fred Olsen owned ship was greeted by NHS staff and ambulance crews when it docked in Scotland after a 13-day tour of the Canary Islands that was marred by a suspected norovirus outbreak.February 2012 The second consecutive outbreak of norovirus hit Princess Cruises, cutting short the Carribbean holidays of more than 3,000 passengers. The ship was ordered back to Port Everglades for a special clean, ending its voyage two days early. Around 114 passengers and 59 crew members on board the Ruby Princess were hit by the bug.Just a week earlier two other Princess Cruise ships had been struck by the highly contagious illness, which causes nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.October 2009Sixteen passengers on board the Boudicca were confined to their cabins when a norovirus outbreak struck the liner in October 2009. The ship left Venice with 850 passengers on board and was bound for Malaga, Sardinia, Tunisia and Lisbon on its 21-day voyage. The on board doctor confined himself to his own cabin, suspecting he had caught the highly-contagious bug. A Fred Olsen spokesman said at the time, that the swimming pool and food buffet had been closed as a precaution.","More than 130 passengers fell ill on nine separate Fred Olsen cruises .

"Chelsea have suspended three people from Stamford Bridge following the racism incident on the Paris Metro. A group of the club's supporters were filmed chanting 'We're racist, we're racist and that's the way we like it' on the underground system in the French capital on Tuesday.

"A man in Japan claims he has made a pet of what is reputed to be the world's most aggressive insect, the lethal Japanese giant hornet. The 2in-long insects - which can fly at up to 25 mph - are feared for their powerful, poisonous stings that claim about 40 lives in Japan every summer. The high death rate makes them the second most lethal animal in Japan, after man. Scroll down for video . Yeah right: A man in Japan claims he has made a pet of a lethal Japanese giant hornet . Just like any other pet: Twitter user Mikuru625 claims he removed the hornet's sting and poison sacks . Walkies: The hornet is here seen attached to the string harness Mikuru625 says he uses to stop it flying away . But one social network user in Tokyo, the Japanese capital, claims to have tamed a hornet to the extent that he now even takes it on 'walkies' in its own string harness. Large and very aggressive, Japanese giant hornets have quarter-inch-long stingers that inject a venom which attacks the nervous system and damages tissues of its victims. The stings can trigger anaphylactic shock in victims who are allergic to the venom and, if the dose is sufficient, can cause lethal renal failure even to those who are not allergic. Twitter user Mikuru625 claims to have captured hornet with a butterfly net and then held it with tweezers while he removed its sting and poison sacs. After that, he put a string lead around its thorax, and now the harmless hornet goes everywhere with him. 'He does bite occasionally but it doesn't really hurt,' said its owner.

But instead he remained in Holland, becoming a key figure in PSV's domination of the Eredivisie. PSV coach Phillip Cocu has predicted Memphis Depay can be as good as Arjen Robben . Andres Guardado celebrates with Depay during their recent clash with AZ Alkmaar . ‘Whether he can be as good as Arjen Robben?

And both always have the urge to learn. 'But Memphis is only 21-years-old and only in a few years can real conclusions be drawn. Depay’s performances have attracted the attention of several top clubs in Europe and Cocu realises there is a chance the player will leave at the end of this season. ‘That's unfortunate, but on the other hand, we must as a club be proud because we have trained him.

"West Ham manager Sam Allardyce stands by his comments about Louis van Gaal playing long-ball football, but insists they shouldn't be taken as an insult. The 60-year-old boss made the claim after the Hammers 1-1 draw with Manchester United at the Boleyn Ground. But a clearly-riled Van Gaal reacted angrily to the suggestion, using diagrams and statistics to prove the opposite was in fact true at a press conference.

After the match, Allardcye said that his side couldn't deal with Manchester United's long balls . Allardyce has since revealed that he stands by his statement, but suggested it had been misinterpreted. ‘It was, to a certain extent, tongue in cheek,' he wrote in his column in the Evening Standard. 'But I believe I was also making a factual point. ‘The fact was I saw United play, for a time against us last weekend, in a way I have never seen them before. ‘What I didn’t say afterwards was that we played fewer long balls than them — my comment was that United played long-ball football more than I have ever witnessed from them in the past.’ Van Gaal reacted angrily to the suggestion and set out to prove Allardyce wrong in a press conference .

Van Gaal's press conference tactics lesson stunned many supporters, but Allardyce claimed he never meant to offend the Dutchman. ‘Dare I make those comments because it’s Manchester United? Yes, I dare because it was a fact. Louis’s response created a bit of a furore and he obviously felt he had to protect himself by responding to my comments.’ He added: ‘Louis might have felt I was criticising him but the opposite was true. In fact I was praising the way he changed his team to escape from the predicament they were in against us.’","Manchester United and West Ham drew 1-1 in their Premier League clash .

"He is no stranger to controversy and has made headlines for his views on rape, paedophilia and aborting babies with Down’s syndrome. Yesterday Professor Richard Dawkins turned his attention to the subject of people who set fireworks off all year round and the distress they cause animals. The 73-year-old biologist unleashed a furious rant on-line after he claimed his beloved dogs were left terrorised by the loud bangs. Prof Richard Dawkins unleashed a furious rant on-line after he claimed his beloved dogs were left terrorised by the loud bangs caused by fireworks . Taking to social network site Twitter, Prof Dawkins told his one million followers the explosions are no longer reserved for specific celebrations: ‘It isn’t Guy Fawkes Day. It isn’t New Year. It isn’t even a weekend. Why are there fireworks, terrifying the dogs and other non-human animals?’ Prof Dawkins, who taught at Oxford University until his retirement in 2008, added in a second Tweet: ‘Selfishly, I like fireworks. But I suspect that my dogs’ terror is typical of thousands of animals, tame and wild. Don’t you care about them?’ Prof Dawkins, an outspoken atheist, made his comments on Monday night, several days after Diwali, known as the festival of light and celebrated by Hindus and Sikhs, which saw scores of fireworks let off last week. In theory the next set of rockets should not be expected until November 5 – when bonfire night marks Guy Fawkes’s unsuccessful plot to blow up Parliament in 1605. Prof Dawkins takes to twitter to vent his spleen about the letting off of fireworks all year round . According to Prof Dawkins, this is no longer the case. He later tweeted: ‘Many replies to my firework tweet say it’s only 2 or 3 days a year. If only. In Oxford it’s most weekends and often (as now) weekdays too.’ The academic was flooded with support for his comments, made on Monday night, from dog owners across the world who called for firework displays to be restricted or banned. One wrote: ‘We had to lock our dog in the bathroom with a fan running to dull the noise this year. Terrified of sounds for weeks after.’ Another posted: ‘My mother’s dog was diagnosed by the vet with a “stress reaction” related to fireworks on July 4 here in the US.’ Others told how their dogs had run away or been injured after being scared by the noise. And many of Prof Dawkins’s followers from overseas shared their own nations’ rules on firework use, including in Vancouver British Columbia, Canada, where use of fireworks requires a permit to be obtained. Private displays are also prohibited in most of Australia. In the UK, under the Fireworks Regulations 2004, anyone over the age of 18 can buy and use fireworks . One Twitter user wrote: ‘Believe it or not Prof, but even South Africa has banned private fireworks years ago in consideration to pets and animals.’ In the UK, under the Fireworks Regulations 2004, anyone over the age of 18 can buy and use fireworks. Some shops are only licensed to sell fireworks around special events, such as New Year, but others are licenced all year round. According to the Dogs’ Trust, 66 per cent of dogs in the UK are frightened of fireworks. A recent survey carried out by the charity found that 80 per cent of pet owners believe fireworks should be restricted to organised official displays. According to the Dogs’ Trust, 66 per cent of dogs in the UK are frightened of fireworks . Describing the distress fireworks can cause, a spokesman for the campaign group Peta said: ‘Richard Dawkins is absolutely right… [fireworks] can be a nightmare for animals as, from their perspective, it seems that World War III has suddenly broken out. The booms, bangs, pops and whizzes of Catherine wheels, Roman candles and other fireworks ignite fear, terror and panic in our beloved animal companions as well as in birds and other wildlife.’ Prof Dawkins did not elaborate on the number of dogs he owns during his Twitter discussion but in a photoshoot for a newspaper last year he was pictured clutching his dog Tycho. Another of his dogs called Pamba died five years ago. Earlier this year the scientist said babies with Down’s syndrome should be aborted - and parents should ‘try again’. He was also condemned by women and child abuse victims for referring to ‘mild date rape’ and ‘mild paedophilia’ in a Twitter discussion about ‘logical thinking’.","Dawkins, 73, took to twitter to slam inconsiderate people who use fireworks .

"As a U.S. senator, Barack Obama won $48 million in federal funding to help Ukraine destroy thousands of tons of guns and ammunition – weapons which are now unavailable to the Ukrainian army as it faces down Russian President Vladimir Putin during his invasion of Crimea. In August 2005, just seven months after his swearing-in, Obama traveled to Donetsk in Eastern Ukraine with then-Indiana Republican Senator Dick Lugar, touring a conventional weapons site. The two met in Kiev with President Victor Yushchenko, making the case that an existing Cooperative Threat Reduction Program covering the destruction of nuclear weapons should be expanded to include artillery, small arms, anti-aircraft weapons, and conventional ammunition of all kinds. After a stopover in London, the senators returned to Washington and declared that the U.S. should devote funds to speed up the destruction of more than 400,000 small arms, 1,000 anti-aircraft missiles, and more than 15,000 tons of ammunition. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Then-Senator Barack Obama inspected decommissioned artillery shells in a warehouse in Donetsk, Ukraine, and argued that Congress should allocate money to speed up the destruction of thousands of tons more . Obama, then a junior senator on the Foreign Relations Committee, worked with then-Republican committee chair Dick Lugar (L) to oversee destruction of Soviet-era war materiel through an agreement that Lugar had brokered years earlier, covering only nuclear weapons . Photographs from the trip show Obama . inspecting a plant where Soviet-era artillery shells and shoulder-fired . missiles were collecting dust, leftovers dumped in Ukraine after the . USSR withdrew from Eastern bloc nations after the once-mighty communist . nation fell apart. The United Nations had already identified some 7 million small arms and light weapons, and 2 million tons of conventional ammunition, warehoused in more than 80 weapons depots spread across the country. Many of the artillery shells shown in photographs from Donetsk, multiple weapons experts told MailOnline, would be the same types of ammunition required to repel advancing Russian divisions as they advanced to the west, had they not been destroyed. Two experts said the ammunition, particularly small-arms rounds, would have been useful to train Ukraine's armed forces and million-strong reserves. 'Vast stocks of conventional munitions and military supplies have accumulated in Ukraine,' Obama said in am August 30, 2005 statement from Donetsk. 'Some of this stockpile dates from World War I and II, yet most dates from Cold War buildup and the stocks left behind by Soviet withdrawals from East Germany, the Czech Republic, Hungry and Poland.' 'We need to eliminate these . stockpiles for the safety of the Ukrainian people and people around . world, by keeping them out of conflicts around the world.' More than a year later, President George W. Bush signed into law a proposal authored by Obama and Lugar. In 2006 Ukraine President Viktor Yushchenko (L) warmly received Lugar and Obama in Kiev . Russian infantry vehicles have met no significant resistance from Ukrainian armed forces as they move into the nation's sovereign territory . Sen. Lugar lost his seat in 2012 after it emerged that he no longer lived in Indiana, the state he represented. Obama became president in 2008, and now faces a crisis in the nation he once sought to disarm . Obama said then that the existing Cooperative Threat Reduction Program 'has effectively . disposed of thousands of weapons of mass destruction, but . we must do far more to keep deadly conventional weapons like . anti-aircraft missiles out of the hands of terrorists.' Much of the Ukrainian small-arms supply was ultimately exported, not scrapped, by a Yushchenko regime that chose revenue from arms dealing over the cost of melting down metal. In 2008 the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute reported that between 2004 and 2007, the Ukrainian Export Control Service told the UN that it sent 721,777 small arms and light weapons to 27 different countries. The United States was the top recipient, with more than 260,000 of those weapons, followed by the UK and Libya, which each imported more than 101,000. That flood of weapons exports has continued, with annual export records showing hundreds of thousands of new exports each year, covering everything from pistols and carbine rifles to heavy machine guns and anti-tank weapons. Payback: Obama presented Lugar with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in November 2013 . Russian President Vladimir Putin (C) sent troops into the Crimea, a Ukrainian peninsula populated by more than 1 million ethnic Russians, without meeting significant military resistance . But while today's 130,000-strong standing Ukrainian military isn't short on AK-47s, Russian troops have met little to no large-scale resistance from armored divisions or heavy artillery as they steamrolled their way into Crimea. Some of that was Ukraine's own doing – it sold 320 tanks to Pakistan in the 1990s, for instance – but Obama and Lugar accelerated the pace of the country's arms liquidation. While the Ukrainian army seems to have been careful to avoid provoking an even larger conflict, it's impossible to know whether Putin would have behaved differently in the face of columns of heavy weapons that once belonged to the Soviet Union in whose KGB he held a high-ranking position. Sky News video broadcast on Tuesday showed Russian troops firing automatic weapons over the heads of apparently unarmed Ukrainian Air Force personnel near a contested airfield in Crimea.","Obama traveled to Ukraine with Sen.

"The trial over Stephen Collins' divorce has been delayed after his estranged wife's attorney withdrew from the case just hours before testimony was supposed to begin. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Scott Gordon, the presiding judge over divorce cases, granted a motion by attorney Larry Ginsberg to withdraw from the case on Wednesday. Judge Mark Juhas, who was slated to preside over the trial, ordered the proceedings to be delayed until January 5 to give Collins' estranged wife Faye Grant time to find a new lawyer. Scroll down for video . The trial over Stephen Collins' divorce has been delayed after the attorney of his estranged wife Faye Grant withdrew from the case just hours before testimony was supposed to begin . The former couple had been scheduled to start an eight-day trial on how to divide their assets and how much spousal support Grant should receive. Collins, who starred in the series 7th Heaven, was not present in court. Grant represented herself at a hearing in which the trial was delayed and her estranged husband's lawyer sought to reduce her spousal support payments. The case has been complicated by the release of audio in which the actor purportedly acknowledges molesting underage girls. Collins, 67, has lost roles as a result of the recording, including a $75,000 part in the upcoming film Ted 2. The leaked recording has cost Collins a role in the upcoming film Ted 2 and knocked scheduled re-runs of 7th Heaven off two cable networks . His attorney Mark Vincent Kaplan said on Wednesday that the actor was also losing residual income on the 7th Heaven series. Kaplan said having Ginsberg withdraw hours before the trial's start would be 'visiting a terrible hardship on Mr. Collins.' He said the actor has spent $1 million already on attorneys' and experts' fees in the case, and the delay would probably cost him another $200,000. The decades-old molestation allegations are being investigated by authorities in Los Angeles and New York. The actor has not been charged. Collins contends that his estranged wife should receive no support because the recording from a 2012 couple's counseling session and its subsequent posting by celebrity website TMZ has destroyed his career. Gordon ruled on the motion after meeting in closed session with Ginsberg and Grant. Collins had worked steadily in television and movie roles since the early 1970s, including appearing in the 1979 movie Star Trek: The Motion Picture, left, . Kaplan, Collins' attorney, was kept out of the proceedings so that Ginsberg could give details on why he was leaving the case abruptly. Gordon said Ginsberg's motion was not motivated by an effort to delay the trial and that there was a complete breakdown in the lawyer's communications with Grant. Collins filed for divorce in 2012 and most of the issues in the case have been about money, although Grant included details about the molestation allegations in court filings last year. Grant has said she gave police the audio only after Collins refused to seek appropriate treatment. Grant has denied giving the recording to TMZ. Grant, who is an actress who has said in court filings she put her career largely on hold during her marriage to Collins, is seeking to maintain $13,000 a month in spousal support payments. Juhas refused a request on Wednesday by Kaplan to reduce Collins' support payments immediately. Collins had worked steadily in television and movie roles since the early 1970s, with appearances in movies such as All the President's Men, Star Trek: The Motion Picture, and recurring roles on TV series after 7th Heaven concluded its 11-season run in 2007.","The lawyer representing Collins' estranged wife Faye Grant has withdrawn from the couple bitter divorce battle .

"Women aged 40 and over are spending more money than ever on risque lingerie and erotic accessories, say sales statistics from lingerie companies. They're spending a small fortune on lingerie and sex toys - more than double the amount women in their 20s spend, according to lingerie and erotic accessory boutique Petits Bisous. Over the last three months, the company has seen a 50 per cent rise in customers over 40 years old. Women in their forties have the highest sex drive - and in turn are investing most in risque lingerie . Women over 40 are the ones buying the sexier, more risqué pieces of underwear, as well as a variety of toys, sex games and role playing pieces. Major research says that women approaching 40 have higher libidos than girls in their 20s . When asked, women credited erotic novels such as Fifty Shades of Grey and books by Tiffany Reisz and Sylvia Day for their increased sexual appetite. Customers in their 20s spend, on average, 15 minutes in store while those in their 40s spend a more leisurely one hour. The findings suggest that the younger customers know what items they want before entering the store and favour a quick transaction. But older customers are more willing to spend time trying on lingerie and learning about the latest sex toys and accessories before making purchases. Customers in their 20s spend on average £150 on lingerie while those above 40 years old spend in excess of £500. Of course, these findings can be . partially explained by the fact that older age groups may have more . disposable income than people in their 20s. However, there has also been a 75 per cent rise in women over 40 bringing their partners along to lingerie appointments, suggesting older couples are more forthcoming and honest with each other about what it is they like in the bedroom. Petits Bisous sees an average of 10 couples a week visiting the store together to purchase pieces for the bedroom. In the last two months there has been a 200 per cent rise in women purchasing corsets. The boutique has also seen a 40 per cent rise in male customers over the last two months. The most popular items bought by men are silk stockings, suspenders and negligees for their lover. Leading London erotic boutique Coco De Mer report a similar customer base to Petit Bisous. They . report that 45-54 is the second biggest customer group, but both the . 45-54 age bracket and the 65-plus group spend considerably more than the . 18-24-year-olds. Women over 40 mostly brave the downstairs turquoise boudoir where naughtier items are kept . Online, . an average man of that age will spend considerably more but he will . also browse for much longer and save pieces in his basket which he never . ends up buying. Women . of the age may spend less but they know exactly what they want, find it . without browsing and buy. This reflects that older women know what they . want and are enjoying erotica. The findings reflect new major research from sex toy firm Lovehoney, who report that women approaching 40 have higher libidos than girls in their 20s. They polled 2,100 men and women ranging . in age from 18 to over 65 to find out how happy people are . with their sex lives, how often they have sex and how libido is affected . by age. It found . that women with the highest sex drives are aged between 35 and 44. More . than a third of women (36 per cent) in the same age group are having . sex two to three times a week and fifth (20 per cent) four to six times a . week. More than three-quarters of women in this age group are satisfied with their sex lives. One factor in the high levels of sexual satisfaction in middle-aged women is - again - erotic books such as Fifty Shades Of Grey. Of those who have read the book, 47 per cent say that it has actively influenced their sex lives.","Petit Bisous customers are 60% women over 40 - who buy naughtier items .

"The deadly Ebola virus poses a 'very serious threat' to Britain, it was warned today as the government convened a meeting of its Cobra emergency committee. Prime Minister David Cameron has ordered ministers to review measures needed to protect Britons at home and abroad. It comes as a man has been tested for the Ebola virus in Birmingham while another also went to Charing Cross Hospital in London fearing he he was infected. Doctors have been put on red alert for signs that the outbreak which has killed more than 670 people in West Africa could be heading to the UK. Scroll down for video . Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond is to chair a meeting of the emergency committee Cobra to  examine measures which need to be taken in the UK or at diplomatic posts abroad 'in order to manage the threat' Chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Davies and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt arriving at the COBRA meeting in Downing Street . Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond chaired the Cobra meeting today, in an escalation of the government's response to the crisis. He said the UK government was examining the risks of the 'new and emerging threat'. He told Sky News: 'As far as we are aware, there are no British nationals so far affected by this outbreak and certainly no cases in the UK. 'However the Prime Minister does regard it as a very serious threat and I will be chairing a Cobra meeting later today to assess the situation and look at any measures that we need to take either in the UK, or in our diplomatic posts abroad in order to manage the threat. 'We are very much focused on it as a new and emerging threat which we need to deal with.' Hospitals and medical centres across the UK remain on red alert for the virus, with doctors being told to look out for symptoms of the disease which can go unnoticed for three weeks and kills 90 per cent of victims. Concern: Ebola (above) has already killed 672 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone and infected more than 1,200 since it was first diagnosed in February. Symptoms include sudden fever, vomiting and headaches . Virus: Symptoms of Ebola include high fever, bleeding, damage to the nervous system and vomiting . The Department of Health confirmed protections have been put in place to deal with the deadly bug, should it spread to Britain. A spokesman said: ‘We are well prepared to identity and deal with any potential cases of Ebola, although there has never been a case in this country.’ The Government’s chief scientific advisor also issued a frank warning about the disease, which he said could have a ‘major impact’ on the UK. Sir Mark Walport said: ‘The UK is fortunate in its geographical position. We’re an island. But we are living in a completely interconnected world where disruptions in countries far away will have major impacts. ‘The most dangerous infections of humans have always been those which have emerged from other species,’ he told the Daily Telegraph, referring to the virus originating in fruit bats and monkeys. He said the Government was ‘keeping a close eye’ on the outbreak and was prepared for the disease spreading to Britain, but insisted any risk was ‘very low’. He added: ‘We have to think about risk and managing risk appropriately.’ Public Health England has added to fears about the spread of the virus by saying it was ‘clearly not under control’. What is Ebola virus disease? Ebola . is a severe, often fatal illness, with a death rate of up to 90 per . cent.The illness affects humans as well as primates, including monkeys, . gorillas and chimpanzees.How do people become infected with the virus? Ebola is transmitted through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals. In . Africa infection in humans has happened as a result of contact with . chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, monkeys, forest antelope and . porcupines found ill or dead in the rainforest. Once . a person becomes infected, the virus can spread through contact with a . sufferer's blood, urine, saliva, stools and semen. A person can also . become infected if broken skin comes into contact with a victim's soiled . clothing, bed linen or used needles. Men . who have recovered from the disease, can still spread the virus to . their partner through their semen for seven weeks after recovery. Who is most at risk? Those at risk during an outbreak include: . What are the typical signs and symptoms? Sudden . onset of fever, intense weakness,  muscle pain, headache and sore . throat. That is followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, impaired kidney . and liver function and internal and external bleeding. The incubation period is bet ween two and 21 days. A person will become contagious once they start to show symptoms. When should you seek medical care? If . a person is in an area affected by the outbreak, or has been in contact . with a person known or suspected to have Ebola, they should seek . medical help immediately.What is the treatment? Severely ill patients require intensive supportive care. They need intravenous fluids to rehydrate them. But there is currently no specific treatment for the disease. Some patients will recover with the appropriate care.Can Ebola be prevented? Currently there is no licensed vaccine for Ebola. Several are being tested but are not available for clinical use. Is it safe to travel to affected areas? The . World Health Organisation reviews the public health situation . regularly, and recommends travel or trade restrictions if necessary. The . risk of infection for travellers is very low since person-to-person . transmission results from direct contact with bodily fluids of victims.Source: World Health Organisation .","Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond to chair meeting in Whitehall today .

"The crisis in Crimea won't keep President Barack Obama from forging ahead with a weekend getaway with his wife and daughters in the Florida Keys. But it's more than the Oval Office that will be dark as Russia's incursion into Ukraine reaches its one week mark. Vice President Joe Biden and his wife are vacationing in the Virgin Islands. And national security adviser Susan Rice is traveling in the Middle East for meetings with her counterparts. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said 'there's always a chance' Obama could cut a trip short and return to Washington, but this weekend's vacation appeared solid.

'The fact of the matter is what the . president is doing this weekend in Florida is essentially what the . president would be doing if he stayed back at the White House,' Earnest told reporters traveling with Obama. The president, he said, was looking forward to 'getting a little bit of downtime in the warm weather with his wife and daughters.' Obama's . vacation at a private club on one of the islands off Florida's southern . tip was tacked onto an afternoon visit by the president and his wife, . Michelle, to a Miami high school to announce new Education Department . initiatives to help more students complete the paperwork needed to . qualify for federal financial aid or student loans. Every president gets criticized for the amount of time he spends away from the White House, and Obama is no different. Paul . C. Light, who teaches public service at New York University, said Obama . would have been wise to remain in Washington.

"A Massachusetts police officer has been sacked after shouting a racial insult at Boston Red Sox star Carl Crawford. The black outfielder was signing autographs before a game in New Hampshire when he was branded a 'Monday' by a heckler in the stands. The comment was traced back to off-duty officer John Perreault, who has a history of being racially offensive, Leominster Mayor Dean Mazzarella said. 'Egregious': Massachusetts police officer John Perreault (left) has been fired for calling Boston Red Sox outfielder Carl Crawford (right) a racially offensive name . The term 'Monday' can be used as a racist statement towards African-Americans and in some cases is tantamount to calling them a 'n*****', according to the Urban Dictionary. It comes from the common dislike for the first day of the working week and is often used in the hope the abused person will not be aware it is an insult. In a letter informing Perreault of his decision to fire him, Mazzarella said: 'Your actions are so egregious that severe discipline is warranted. 'There is simply no place for your behavior in the workplace and there is no place for someone who exhibits such objectionable behavior in the Leominster Police Department.' Mazzarella's decision comes a day after Police Chief Robert Healey recommended during a disciplinary hearing that the mayor fire Perrault, saying he'd used racial slurs at least twice before. Heckled: Crawford was signing autographs in front of the dugout before a game when he was called a 'Monday' by Perreault, who was sitting in the stands . Perreault's attorney, Joseph . Sandulli, said his client would either appeal through the civil service . commission or file a grievance through the police union. Sandulli said . Perreault didn't intend the word as a racist insult and the city . overreacted. 'He was criticizing Crawford for being a bad player, not because he was a black man,' Sandulli said. A Red Sox spokeswoman said the team would have no comment on the decision. The term 'Monday' has several meanings. It is associated with the idea that Monday is the most-hated day of the week. But it is also used as a derogatory term for blacks and can be as offensive as using the word 'n*****'. It is often employed in the hope the victim will not be aware they are being insulted because it is such a mundane word. According to Urban Dictionary, it has been used in a routine by Canadian comedian Russell Peters in which he says: 'Damn it, that Monday over there stole my car!' Perreault had been on paid leave since he called Crawford a 'Monday' before a July 5 minor league game in Manchester, N.H. Crawford was playing with a Red Sox . minor league affiliate while rehabilitating a wrist injury and Perreault . attended the game while off duty. After Perreault taunted Crawford, the outfielder notified stadium officials. In the termination notice, Mazzarella cited previous alleged racist . remarks by Perreault, including when he repeatedly used a racial slur in . a bar while watching black NBA players. In another instance at Leominster's . St Patrick's Day celebration, Perreault saw a black man wearing a shirt . displaying the name of the Irish beer Guinness, and commented to him 'I . didn't know they serve Guinness in Africa.' Mazzarella said Perreault's Facebook . page also contained racially insensitive content and said the officer . had even referred to his Monday comment as 'priceless' on there. Sandulli said two superior officers . with Perreault at the parade clearly didn't consider the remark improper . because they didn't report it, even though they're obligated to report . anything that violates department rules. He said Perrault's alleged remarks at . the bar were hearsay because the city relied on a written statement and . never produced the witness for questioning. Also, Sandulli said, almost no one at . the hearing, including Perreault, was previously aware that Monday can . be used as a racist term. 'He feels strongly he didn't mean the . comment in a racial way, and he's not a racist, and he wants to . establish that,' Sandulli said. But Mazzarella didn't believe Perreault's explanations. 'In arriving at this conclusion, I . did not check common sense at the door,' he wrote, adding the word . Monday was 'certainly directed at Mr Crawford's race.' Perreault is considering an appeal.","John Perreault heckled black outfielder during game .

"Manchester United have stunned their supporters by signing Bolton Wanderers defender Andy Kellett on loan for the remainder of the season. The 21-year-old has made just one appearance for Neil Lennon's side this season, playing 51 minutes in the Trotters' 4-2 defeat by Rotherham. Kellett, who was on loan at Plymouth for three months earlier in the season, will join United's Under 21 side until June. Manchester United have stunned their supporters by signing Bolton Wanderers defender Andy Kellett on loan . He made his Bolton debut at the tail end of last season - playing in the final three games of the campaign - with a late substitute appearance in a 1-0 home defeat by Leicester. Further cameos followed in a 3-1 win at Sheffield Wednesday and a home draw with Birmingham. It means Kellet has played 85 minutes of Championship football although he was a regular for Plymouth between October last year and January. He scored one goal - in a 3-2 win at Northampton - in 15 games, . As part of the deal, 19-year-old midfielder Saidy Janko will move the other way . Kellett is thought to have been brought in due to a lack of numbers in the Manchester giants' youth team after numerous players were sent out on loan. As part of the deal, 19-year-old midfielder Saidy Janko will move the other way. With rumours of Mats Hummels joining from Dortmund, it's safe to say the defensive signing is not quite what United's fans were hoping for on transfer deadline day. Who? Exactly. When Jim White reported the signing on Sky Sports News' Deadline Day coverage, Twitter went into meltdown. Surely this was some mistake? This was not a Mats Hummels or a Marco Reus. Across the country, bemused United fans rewound their TVs and wnt straight to Google. Sure enough, abut half an hour after the deadline came confirmation via a tweet from United's official account to their 4.35m followers. The club had brought in Andy Kellett on loan for the rest of the season with Under 21 right back Saidy Janko going the other way. But why? It's a good question. Some would wonder about the logic behind sending one of your own players out on loan and bringing another in on loan. But there is method in the madness. United are keen to get as many of their own youngsters out into the big bad world of men's football. They want them toughened up and introduced to a level of aggression rarely seen in the Under 21 league. Officials will hope Janko's footballing education will be furthered in the Championship. Departures like this, however, leave their own Under 21 side short of numbers. Manager Warren Joyce is known to believe that there are many unearthed gems in the lower leagues. He is known as a coach who sees things in players that others do not. This would appear to be the case with Kellett. So what's his pedigree? He's Bolton-born , 21 and a left back. A product of the club's academy he has made four first-team appearances and earned a loan move to Plymouth Argyle in October. While at the League Two Devon side he scored a wonder goal at Northampton Town and was described as a solid performer by fans. How did the move come about? United had to fight off interest from Plymouth (not a sentence you often write) to bring him to Old Trafford. The Bolton News spoke to first-team coach Garry Parker who relayed the amusing moment when the news was broken to the youngster. 'Sit down,' he said, before adding that they had some 'good news and bad news'. Kellett opted for the bad news and was told he was not going to Home Park. Presumably fearing the worst he tentatively enquired as to what the good news was. 'You're going to Manchester United,' was the response. What can we expect? In an interview with fans site Vital Bolton, Kellett says he models himself on Jordi Alba and likes to get forward when he can and play on the wing. Former Wanderers boss Dougie Freedman was impressed and made him the first Bolton-born youth product to start for the club in eight years after he overcame what the Scot described as off-the-field attitude issues. Joyce has seen him in action and is impressed, and with Louis van Gaal's history of giving youth a chance, who knows what will happen next?","Manchester United have signed Andy Kellett from Bolton Wanderers .

"Forget planking, get over owling, this is the hot new posing craze sweeping the internet - putting your breasts on things. Mamming as it's known is aimed at both women and men and involves resting your bust on random objects. It's the brainchild of Michelle Jaret and Michelle Lamont who wanted to inspire women to take action and get a mammogram early if they suspect a problem. Scroll down for video . Breast internet craze yet? Mamming is aimed at both women and men and involves resting your bust on random objects . Popular: The idea began in New York thanks to Michelle Lamont and Michelle Jaret but is now sweeping the internet . Objective: The creators hope the craze will become as big as planking or owling . Aged just 25, Michelle Lamont is a breast cancer survivor and she knows early detection is vital to fight the killer disease. Now ad agency executive Michelle, from New York, has seen her idea go global as more and more people take to the internet to post their 'mamming' poses. She said: ‘Overall the response has been very positive, although there have been some people wondering how a campaign like this is going to “cure” breast cancer. Clean act: The idea is to keep things 'PG' and not bare too much flesh . Chest file it: The photographs are all sent to thisismamming.com which urges people to 'embrace the awkwardness' The creators wanted to break through the clutter of Breast Awareness Month . ‘When I was sick, I asked my doctors about a cure - one actually told me that the best cure we have is prevention. ‘Prevention is screening like mammograms and self-exams and they are the best tool we have to catch cancer early, and catching it early is how we beat it. ‘We would love to see mamming become as big on the web as planking and owling. Part of the reason that we love mamming as a vehicle for spreading awareness is because it taps into an existing trend that is really fun and relevant to everyone. The creators of mamming say that it taps into an existing trend - and is great fun . The creator of the mamming initiative (not pictured) was a breast cancer survivor and she knows early detection is vital to fight the killer disease . Bra-vo: This mamming participant has decided to post a rather fruity picture . Mam's the word: The photographs are a way of women showing solidarity with those having to have mammograms . ‘Our goal was to create something fun that would break through the clutter of breast cancer awareness month. We've seen breast cancer awareness campaigns that use humour and sexuality, and ones that don't mention mammograms or breasts at all. ‘We wanted to do something that focused on the woman as being responsible for her breasts and her health. Overall, we hope that mamming reminds women to get screened, and maybe makes them feel a little less awkward about putting their boobs in the mammogram machine. ‘We hope people will keep it PG, but the only real rule is to make your mam awesome.

"An alleged flasher has come up with a novel defence – his manhood is too small for anyone to notice it. The 54-year-old man identified only as Herbert O was accused of showing a teenage girl rather more than the package he was delivering in August 2013. That night the girl and her mother went to the police to file a complaint against man, from Leer, Lower Saxony, Germany. However, Herbert has claimed that he is too under-endowed to have flashed the girl and has even asked his wife to stand up in court and testify to his lack of inches. Leer town centre: Herbert O is on trial here accused of flashing a teenage girl but claims his penis is too small for him to have committed the crime and his wife stood up in court and testified on his behalf . 'I'm sorry, darling, but your penis is too short to hang out of your trousers,' she told the local court in the town of Leer in East Frisia. Defence lawyer Lutz Winkler then requested the judge Ulrike Andrees to measure the organ herself to verify the claims. Judge Andrees has asked the coroners' office in Oldenburg to measure Mr O’s organ. 'If the wife has spoken out so frankly about this, I have to follow it up,' she said. Herr Winkler is determined to see his client cleared and has refused to settle for a fine in exchange for settling the case. They may yet have months to wait to see if the expert medical opinion stands up in court. 'We've never seen anything like this before,' said court manager Norbert Bruns.","Herbert O, 54, accused of flashing by teenage girl as he delivered a package .

"An intricate etching on ostrich eggs joined together to make a sphere is the oldest globe of the New World ever to be discovered. Latin inscriptions and delicate outlines of countries informed by knowledge of explorers such as Christopher Columbus, made in the early 1500s cover the sphere, but the origin of the globe is a mystery. A cartographer believes the globe could have been made in Florence, Italy and claims that the skilful engraver could even have crafted the object in the workshop of Leonardo da Vinci. An intricate etching on ostrich eggs joined together could be the oldest globe of the New World to ever be discovered. The delicate outlines of countries are informed by knowledge of explorers such as Christopher Columbus, made in the early 1500s. It's origin is a mystery . The object is about the size of a grapefruit and is constructed from the lower halves of two ostrich eggs to make it almost spherical. Until now the oldest globe showing the New World was thought to be the 'Lenox Globe,' which is kept in the New York Public Library, but a study of the egg globe, published in The Washington Map Society's journal, The Portolan, said this one is older. Belgium research scholar Dr S. Missinne believes the egg globe could actually have been used as to cast the Lennox globe, dating it at approximately 1504. Just seven names mark the Western Hemisphere (pictured) and none denote North America, which is shown as a group of islands. However, three names are marked in South America: Mundus novus, - New World - Terra de Brazil and Terra Sanctae Crucis, which translates as 'land of the holy cross' He said the globe reflects knowledge of the New World gleaned by early European explorers including Amerigo Vespucci, after whom the Americas were named. It contains different types of ships, monsters, waves, a marooned sailor struck by a shipwreck, 71 place names and one sentence that reads 'hic svnt dracones' or 'here be dragons'.

Cartographers have said that for many countries, including Japan and Brazil, the globe is the oldest that marks their country. Tom Sander, editor of The Portolan who has inspected the globe, told the Society said the find was a major discovery and has been dated after a year of scientific examination. The egg globe was bought from a dealer at the London map Fair in 2012 who claimed it had come from an 'important European collection,' but the current owner made it available to Dr Missinne for research.

He admitted to being sceptical about the origin, date, geography and provenance of the globe at first as nobody had heard of it before and discoveries of this kind are extremely rare. The globe was subject to computer topography testing, carbon dating and an analysis of the innk used in the engraving in its surface, as well as checks that the geographical, cartographic and historical details all added up. He told the journal: 'I was excited to look into it further, . and the more I did so, and the more research that we did, the clearer it . became that we had a major find.'

"Apple is being sued in a price-fixing case that could see eBook prices fall sharply. The U.S. Department of Justice claims that the technology company and five of the world's largest publishers colluded to cost shoppers 'tens of millions of dollars'. Apple, HarperCollins, Hachette, Penguin Group, Macmillan and Simon & Schuster are accused of conspiring over phone calls, emails and meals in the 'private dining rooms of upscale Manhattan restaurants'. The Justice Department is investigating alleged price-fixing by Apple and five major publishers: Simon & Schuster, HarperCollins Publishers, Lagardere SCA's Hachette Book Group, Pearson and Macmillan . The DoJ claims the alleged . price-fixing came in response to Amazon's aggressive pricing policy, . which challenged the industry with a maximum eBook price of $9.99 (£6), . lower than that offered by many of its rivals. If the lawsuit is successful, prices . on the Kindle and other e-readers could tumble in the U.S. and Britain. Such a victory would end the deal struck by Apple that prevented . publishers from selling books via Amazon or elsewhere at lower prices . than they offered on Apple's iTunes Store. The arrangement has meant that many eBooks cost the same – or even more than – their paper counterparts. Apple and the publishers are accused . of creating a so-called 'agency model' of pricing, under which they . dictate the price of an eBook as long as they give 30 per cent of the . revenue to the retailer. Book prices on Amazon's Kindle and other e-readers could tumble after a deal in a major price-fixing case is reportedly 'close' The agency model, set up when Apple . launched its iPad in 2010 and since widely adopted, was seen as an . attempt to ease Amazon's grip on the digital market. Previously, retailers set the price of . eBooks themselves – but many sacrificed their profit margin to win . market share. This lowered customers' expectations of how much an eBook . should cost. It also rattled publishers, who viewed eBooks as a way of . propping up their overall profits. A spokesman for the DoJ said: . 'Publishers saw the rise on eBooks, and particularly Amazon's price . discounting, as a substantial challenge to their traditional business . model. '[They] feared that lower retail . prices for eBooks might lead eventually to lower wholesale prices for . eBooks [and] lower prices for print books.' To combat this, they 'teamed . up with Apple, which shared the same goal of restraining retail price . competition', they added. The European Commission is already investigating alleged price-fixing in the eBook market. Jim Friedland, an analyst at Cowen . & Co, said victory for the DoJ 'would be a positive for Amazon . because the company's greatest strength is as a high-volume, low-price . retailer and the wholesale model plays into that'. Amazon's Jeff Bezos: The internet retailer has been left unable to discount ebooks after a deal between Apple and publishers . Apple did a deal with publishers two years ago which led to retailers such as Amazon being unable to discount books to lower prices than iTunes store . Late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs reportedly did not want . Apple's iBook store to compete with Amazon's cheap prices, and helped broker the deal between publishers. The European Commission is . investigating claims that Apple and five publishing houses worked . together to keep eBook prices artificially high. It . is also suggested that the arrangement killed competition by ensuring . that Apple’s rivals, such as Amazon and Kobo, could not undercut its . prices. In The UK, the .

"Russia is accusing Kiev of using white phosphorous in bombings of Ukrainian cities controlled by rebel separatists. The city of Slavyansk came under fire overnight on Thursday and residents told Russian media that incendiary bombs were dropped on the city. A video allegedly showing the overnight attack by Kiev military sees white flames rain down from the sky. Scroll down for video . Potential proof: This video was released by  Russian media earlier this month, and allegedly shows white phosphorous bombs being dropped on a Ukranian city . Slavyansk is a separatist stronghold in southeastern Ukraine which has been the focal point of the government’s terrorist crackdown over the past months. Although Kiev and groups of pro-Russian rebels have exchanged fire in and around the city since the end of April, Kiev firmly denies any use of banned weapons and incendiary bombs. Ukraine’s National Guard, a part-volunteer force heavily involved in the eastern campaign, dismissed the incendiary bomb charges as absurd. The video allegedly filmed in Slavyansk during the bombing began circulating in Russian media on Thursday and witnesses say they came under fire from both rockets and bombs. ‘We all saw what happened here yesterday. They used rocket launchers as well as incendiary bombs against us,’ resident Roman Litvinov told Russia Today. White light: According to witnesses of the shelling on June 12, the bombs dropped were incendiary phosphorous bombs, a type of weapon which is banned by the UN, something  firmly denied by Kiev . Although firmly denied by Kiev, Russia claims the bombs are white phosphorous and were dropped by government forces . ‘The ground was on fire. How can the ground burn by itself. It burned for about forty minutes,' he added. ‘Ukrainian defence forces and nationalists are using prohibited weapons against Slavyansk civilians, firing on refugees and killing children,’ said Russia’s human rights ombudsman Konstantin Dolgov yesterday. ‘Kiev’s humanitarian crimes against its residents in the south-east are multiplying. They must be investigated and the guilty punished.’ Incendiary devices are designed to set off fires and were used widely during the Vietnam war. They are banned by the UN Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons. Russia was accused of sending tanks into Ukraine today with Kiev claiming three T-72 tanks entered the country in Snizhne - some 13 miles inside Ukraine. It comes as attention was diverted to chaos in Iraq . Video footage appeared to show  tanks moving towards Horlivka - a mining city in the Donetsk region of Ukraine.

"Valentine's Day is billed as the most . romantic of the year. And for most couples, it means pulling out all . the stops to show their partners just how much they care. However, . one girlfriend used the special day to break up with her boyfriend - . with a cold-hearted message on a petrol station's advertising board. 'Laura' paid to display the message at an Esso garage in Manchester because she . knew her boyfriend went there every day for his lunch so he would see it. Cruel: The break-up message was posted on an ad space at an Esso garage in Manchester by 'Laura' Not only did she announce that she was breaking up with her partner, she also informed him that she was leaving him for another man. The cowardly message reads: 'I’m leaving you for Gary. Your clothes are at your mum’s. I’ve change the locks. 'Sorry to do this on Valentine’s Day. Laura.' The ad, which has become a social media hit, was spotted by Jordan Wilson who posted it on Twitter with the caption: 'This has to be the meanest dump ever. 'Not such a great Valentine’s day for the man in question here. 'To get dumped is bad enough, but the humiliation of seeing it displayed at your local petrol station is just one step too far.' Eagle eye: Twitter user Jordan Wilson spotted the break-up message and posted it on the social media site with it quickly becoming an online hit . The Amscreen board, upon which the cruel message was displayed, usually advertises snack deals. But could this Valentine's break-up just be an elaborate hoax? It transpires that Amscreen is a . company that specialises in selling advertising space on digital signage . screens and is run by none other than entrepreneur Lord Alan Sugar and . his son Simon. That's clever! Simon Sugar, who runs the company, and his father Sir Alan Sugar, who is chairman, both tweeted about the message .

You can rent out a screen via...' Mr Wilson, who first posted the photo spurring the internet frenzy, is a digital account manager at PushON. Spreading the word: The Sugar men tweeted about the break-up message, which has gone viral and even reached press in the US and Australia . After posting the photo, Wilson added: 'It seems the #amscreen pic has reached Australia judging by the recent RT's...'

The art installation's embarrassed captive was removed by a large contingent of firefighters who were called to help pull him free . Embarrassingly for the captive student, the scene caught the attention of a number of passersby - especially when a large contingent of emergency services were called to try and free him. His friend at the scene was also amused enough to take a few photos and post them online. Five emergency vehicles and 22 firefighters were said to have helped free the stuck student. The images were posted on Imgur under the title: 'My Friend Got Stuck in the Vagina Statue in Tubingen'. The sculpture was created by Peruvian artist Fernando de la Jara and is located outside Tubingen University's institute for microbiology and virology, in southwest Germany. Photographer Erick Guzman explained that the stuck man 'just wanted to take a funny picture in the vagina statue'. 'The Germans told us it was a normal thing to do!' However, the stunt was not so funny to the emergency services who arrived to help free him. 'The fire department was not really amused and he was really embarrassed,' Mr Guzman wrote.

"There was a time when no childhood was complete without experiencing the fizzy-pop explosion of a Mento dropped into a bottle of Diet Coke. The liquid would erupt into a fountain of brown froth, spewing soft drink in all directions as it reacted violently with the chewy sweet. But what happens when you dress a grown man from head to toe in Mentos and drop him into a giant vat of Diet Coke? They're not Mento for that! The stunt, created by makers of YouTube channel Epic Meal Time to promote their upcoming TV show, shows an apparently willing participant in the 'Mento suit' smile nervously for the camera before donning a scuba mask and snorkel . This group of Canadian pranksters couldn't wait to find out after spending hours painstakingly creating a 'Mento suit' and stocking up on bottles of coke. The stunt, created by makers of YouTube channel Epic Meal Time to promote their upcoming TV show, begins with an apparently willing participant in the 'Mento suit' smiling nervously for the camera before donning a scuba mask and snorkel. He is next seen perching precariously on a chair balanced above the tank of dark liquid. Suddenly a tennis ball flies into shot and hits a switch, sending him into the drink with explosive effect. A powerful reaction ensues as foam shoots in all directions. The fate of the testee remains unclear, as he is seen thrashing about in the sugary liquid before the video abruptly ends. Hit the switch: Suddenly a tennis ball flies into shot and hits a switch, sending him into the liquid with explosive results . Big reaction: The fate of the testee remains unclear, as he is seen thrashing about in the sugary liquid before the video abruptly ends . High pressure: The reaction is caused by a process called nucleation, whereby the carbon dioxide in the soda is attracted to dozens of tiny pores on the surface of the Mentos, causing so much pressure that the soda erupts . The reaction is caused by a process called nucleation, whereby the carbon dioxide in the soda is attracted to dozens of tiny pores on the surface of the Mentos, causing so much pressure that the soda erupts. Any carbonated beverage will produce a similar effect, but Diet Coke became the most popular after it was found to produce the best results. In 2006, TV show MythBusters concluded that the potassium benzoate, aspartame, and CO2 gas contained in the Diet Coke, in combination with the gelatin and gum arabic ingredients of the Mentos, all contribute to the formation of the foam. Only diet will do: Any carbonated beverage will produce a similar effect, but Diet Coke became the most popular after it was found to produce the best results . Although some scientists claim it is not a chemical reaction, rather a purely physical one. However, the makers' decision to use fruit Mentos instead of mint ones caused some controversy online. Gawker journalist Jay Hathaway wrote: 'Fruit Mentos are more eye-catching, but they have an outer coating that seals in the CO2 and makes the reaction less explosive. 'The more porous mint Mentos, while less tasty, will give you more bang for your buck.'","Made by YouTube channel Epic Meal Time to promote upcoming TV show .

"Diego Costa says he does not want to get caught up in a 'club vs country war' but has declared himself fit for Spain.

Brazil-born Costa pulled out of their most recent qualifier against Macedonia with a hamstring problem. Diego Costa in action during Chelsea's 1-0 win against Sporting Lisbon on Tuesday . Costa hopes to join up with the Spanish national team despite an ongoing hamstring injury . Mourinho, who has continued to play his £32m summer signing despite the long-running injury issue, suggested last week that Costa needed to use the next international break to recover properly. But the striker has said he is fit and wants to be named in Spain's squad for their Euro 2016 qualifiers against Slovakia and Luxembourg. 'I hope I am okay to go with Spain,' Costa told Marca after completing Tuesday's 1-0 Champions League Group G win at Sporting Lisbon. 'If I played 90 minutes it is clear that I am fine, I am feeling better all the time, and it is the boss's [Vicente Del Bosque's] decision.' The Blues forward has scored eight goals in six Premier League games . Asked after whether he feared a 'war' could break out between Mourinho and Spain coach Del Bosque, the Brazil-born player said: 'I do not believe that could happen. I have already had enough with the issue about Brazil. Now I must stay relaxed to be able to work and do things well, with the national team too.' Despite declaring his fitness, Costa admitted he has needed special training to enable him to overcome his hamstring problem, which hampered him regularly through the final stages of last season when he was at Atletico Madrid. 'During the week I am working in an intensive way with the physios, because I have some issues from a while back,' he said.

"A Washington State woman whose story was told by Barack Obama last month as evidence the Affordable Care Act is helping Americans now says the insurance exchange made a mistake and she can’t afford a plan. Jessica Sanford was named by the president in a Rose Garden speech regarding Obamacare after she wrote a letter to the White House thanking them for helping her get health coverage. But last week the 48-year-old self-employed single mom got a letter saying she was given a lower insurance quote and higher tax credit by the state’s exchange than she actually qualified for due to a ‘system error.’ Still uninsured: Jessica Sanford of Washington State was named by President Obama as an Affordable Care Act success story but after a state's error was revealed, it turned out she couldn't get a plan after all . The letter was actually one of several . she’d received from Washington HealthPlanFinder, which is the state’s . Affordable Care Act exchange group. The first told her of an error regarding her tax credit. It had been miscalculated and would be lower than she expected. She . was disappointed in the uptick in cost for her insurance, but still . carried on with her plans to purchase insurance through the exchange at . $280 per month instead of the original quote of $198. But . the second letter informed her she’d get no tax credit at all. That . resulted in an even higher quote of $390 per month, which Sanford told . CNN she just couldn’t afford. There . was a cheaper, ‘bronze’ plan she could buy for $324 per month, but with . higher deductibles she couldn’t afford that either. Before the hammer fell: In a Rose Garden speech, just the pictured pregnant woman famously fell, Obama called Sanford's story, which she emailed to the White House, 'what the Affordable Care Act is all about' Let down: But after receiving several letters from her state exchange about errors regarding her tax credit, it became clear to Sanford that she couldn't afford to buy into the Affordable Care Act . Sanford apologized in the letter and said they were ‘disappointed to have discovered this issue.’ Meanwhile, it was just last month when Obama stood in the Rose Garden and proudly spoke of how the new health insurance exchanges. ‘I recently received a letter from a woman named Jessica Sanford in Washington State,’ President Obama told America in the October 21 speech. ‘Here's what she had to say: . I am a single mom, no child support, self-employed and I haven't had insurance in 15 years because it's too expensive.’ 'I wanted health insurance, wanted this to work. I want it to work for everybody': Sanford says as it stands she can't afford a health plan but blames the state, not the Affordable Care Act as a whole . I was crying the other day when I signed up, so much stress lifted.’ Sanford said she wept when she . believed she’d finally be able to afford insurance. And again when she . learned she actually couldn’t because of the state’s error. ‘I was embarrassed,’ Sanford told CNN. ‘I had a good cry.’ The . self-employed court reporter blames the state of Washington and its . exchange for the issue and says she regrets that Obama mentioned her . name. She voted for Obama twice and supports the Affordable Care Act but admits, ‘They screwed up.’ ‘Wow. You guys really screwed me over,’ Sanford wrote on the state exchange’s . Facebook page. ‘Now I have been priced out and will not be able to . afford the plans you offer. But, I get to pay $95 and up for not having . health insurance. I am so incredibly disappointed and saddened. You . majorly screwed up.’ Sanford who was once so ecstatic to finally be insured is now back to square one. ‘This is it. I'm not getting insurance,’ Sanford told CNN. ‘That's where it stands right now unless they fix it.’ Sanford told NWCN that she's disappointed in her situation and feels for those sharing in the frustration with her. 'I wanted health insurance, wanted this to work. I want it to work for everybody.'","'I was ecstatic': Washington State woman Jessica Sanford was named by President Obama in a Rose Garden speech about affordable health care last month after she wrote a letter thanking the White House for helping her afford insurance .

"If the mysterious underwater world wasn't already fascinating enough, a diver has captured various fish, crabs, shrimps and coral inhabitants of the Indo-Pacific oceans like never before. Underwater photographer Alex Tyrrell . used a standard DSLR camera in an underwater housing, along with external flash . strobes to create the surreal effect. His stunning images show the flora and fauna that live off the coasts of Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines illuminated in bright colours shining like aliens submerged in the deep waters. London-based underwater photographer Alex Tyrrell took these ultraviolet images of underwater creatures as he travelled across Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines. He used external flash strobes to illuminate the underwater flora and fauna and, to create the glowing effect, also filmed the marine life using filters and fluorescent lighting. This image shows a golden mantis shrimp . This image shows a spearing mantis shrimp. Mantis shrimps have excellent sight with eyes mounted on stalks that provide almost 360° vision . When diving with a fluorescent mask the diver said he was blown away by the psychedelic colours and immediately wanted to capture the effect on camera. The 39-year-old, from London, took the photos at Koh Tao, Thailand, the Lembeh Straights, Sulawesi, Indonesia and Anilao Luzon in the Philippines. Tyrrell said: ‘I enjoy fluorescent photography as it's a bit different from normal underwater photos. 'When diving the same area repetitively and seeing the same creatures, it makes things more interesting. ‘Not too many people have done fluorescent photography well, so it's quite unique and more of a challenge. ‘My camera is a standard DSLR in an underwater housing with external strobes - but you need excitation filters over the strobes to create the fluorescent effect and then Barrier Filters over the lens to strip away the excess blue light - letting the camera record the fluorescence. ‘You also need a fluorescent light to be able to see the fluorescent in the first place and a yellow barrier filter over your mask, which performs the same task as on the camera but for your eyes.’ In one image, Tyrrell captured a hydroid decorator crab clinging to the side of coral.

"From outside the changing room, it must have sounded as though I was in labour. And as I huffed and puffed, I was certainly in agony. The green jeans I’d spotted from M&S’s Limited Edition range in my size, a 14, wouldn’t go past my knees. Exasperated, I headed out for a 16 — only to find that they wouldn’t go past my thighs either. So I braved the rails again for a size 18. This time they fitted. Just. What was going on?

"A mother has spoken out about her terrifying ordeal after she was raped by her vile ex-boyfriend who had stalked her for months. Barry Ritson, from Jarrow, South Tyneside, harassed Catherine Cunningham, 50, for three months before breaking into her house while she was sleeping and raping her. Miss Cunningham - who even had the locks on her door changed to avoid 52-year-old Ritson - has now bravely waived her legal right to anonymity in the hope more stalking victims will report their concerns to police before it is too late. Speaking out: Catherine Cunningham, who was raped by her ex-boyfriend after months of harassment, is speaking out in the hope of encouraging other stalking victims to tell police their problems . Barry Ritson, 52, from Jarrow, South Tyneside, was jailed for eight years in June 2013 after being found guilty of rape at Newcastle Crown Court . The mother-of-two, also from Jarrow, wants to warn others that stalking should be reported to the police straight away - incase it becomes as serious as it did for her. She said: 'My whole life changed and I wouldn’t go out. I was frightened to sleep. I couldn’t go back to work. 'You think he will stop tomorrow - you think he will stop phoning and harassing you, but that day doesn’t come.' The tirade of harassment started when Miss Cunningham, a former beauty therapist, told Ritson she was ending their two-year relationship. Ritson started bombarding her with texts and phone calls - and would not take no for an answer. She said: 'It started with text messages and phone calls and it ended up where he would be following me to work and outside home when I came back. And he was ringing through the night. Frightened: The mother-of-two said her whole life changed after she was stalked and raped by Ritson, her ex boyfriend. She was too scared to go out and couldn't work . 'He had the control over me where I started answering my phone rather than having him turning up. He would peer through the windows. 'I was at my friend’s once and he was standing on a wall looking over the fence. The campaign of harassment started when Miss Cunningham tried to end her two-year relationship with Ritson. He then text and phoned her all through the night, even turning up when she was away on holiday . 'He came into the house once and grabbed my phone to see who I was phoning and texting and he phoned all my friends to make sure they were the right numbers. 'He made me feel tired, worn out and scared.' The intimidation - which included turning up when she was on holiday at Sandy Bay, near Ashington, Northumberland - went on for three months. But the harassment took a nastier turn on July 9, 2012 when Ritson crept into Miss Cunningham's home. He had already broken into the house twice before, but Miss Cunningham managed to throw him out. She had even had the locks changed after it emerged he had a key - but he had threatened her by saying ‘Do you think you’re clever?'. But this time, while she was sleeping, Ritson raped her. Ritson then stayed in her home for another six hours after the terrifying assault, making Miss Cunningham fear for her safety. She said: 'There were a few times he came when he had been on the drink and his attitude was more threatening. 'He had broken in twice before that but because I was up and wide awake I managed to get hold of him and throw him out. 'He was watching when I got the locks changed. He broke into the house while I was asleep and he raped me.' When he eventually left she called her friend, who phoned the police. Ritson was . jailed for eight years in June 2013 after a jury at Newcastle Crown . Court found him guilty of rape. Miss Cunningham, who has two grown-up children aged 30 and 28, is now warning others to pick up the phone to police far earlier if they are living in fear. As part of National Stalking Awareness Day today, she hopes by bravely sharing her story others will speak out when they are being targeted. She said: 'If anybody is going through it, they need to report it. 'The police have got a support network. They helped me understand what I was going through and there was always somebody there to listen to me. 'You don’t want to pour your heart out all the time to your kids.' Detective Superintendent Steve Wade from Northumbria Police said Miss Cunningham's devastating experience should serve as a warning to others about the dangers of letting stalking go unreported. He said: 'This year’s theme is working without fear. 'The National Stalking Helpline has done some research into stalking and it’s amazing how many will meet their stalker in the workplace, or they are clients, or the stalker turns up at work, or follows them home. 'The workplace is actually a danger point for stalking behaviour and we are trying to work with employers to raise awareness. 'It’s a greatly under reported crime, with just eight reports of it in 12 months to Northumbria Police. 'Statistics suggest the victim will suffer 100 incidents before they report it.' The National Stalking Helpline is 0808 802 0300 and lines are open between 9.30pm and 4pm on weekdays (1pm and 4pm on Wednesday).","Catherine Cunningham, 50, started being harassed by her ex-boyfriend when she tried to end their two-year relationship .

"A deadline for signing up to Barack Obama's trouble-hit health insurance reforms without penalties will be postponed by six weeks, the White House has said. Officials confirmed that enrollment requirements were being changed so that . consumers could register for health insurance right up to the March 31 . deadline. As it stands, some people previously needed to be signed up by February 15 to ensure their insurance cover took effect in time to avoid sanctions. On the defensive: The Obama administration is looking to extend the cut-off for signing up for health insurance without penalties after criticism about glitches with the website and confusion over deadlines . Glitch: Even some Democrats have been calling for a delay to the March 31 deadline because of problems surrounding the HealthCare.gov website (above) where consumers can shop and sign up for insurance . A . White House official said that pushing back the sign-up requirement was . not related to glitches with Healthcare.gov, but was simply an effort . to eliminate a 'disconnect' over the two deadlines. But the move will fall short for even some in Obama's own party, who are calling for the March 31 deadline to be extended by up to a year because of the chaos surrounding the website. Democrats had hoped to run for re-election next year on the benefits of the health care law for millions of uninsured Americans. Instead, computer problems are keeping many consumers from signing up through new online markets. One House Democrat, Rick Nolan, said the president needs to 'man up' and fire somebody. A prolonged delay in getting . Healthcare.gov to work could jeopardise White House efforts to sign up . as many as 7 million people in 2014, the first full year the law takes . effect. 'Let's get together and fix things:' Democrat Senator Joe Manchin (pictured) has called for a transition year where no-one will face fines because of problems with the Obamacare roll-out . If the enrollment period is extended, as some Democrats are calling for, it would cause serious issues for the insurance companies. They have set their premiums based on the attractive notion that millions of healthy young people would be inclined to register to avoid penalties. One insurance industry insider told CPR that if the rules are changed 'insurers are going to want to change their premiums' because fewer fit people would sign up. Firms also need to plan their premiums for the following year based on who's already signed up, so any delay would hamper their ability to do that. Democrat Senator Joe Manchin of . West Virginia, said he would join a Republican effort to delay the . so-called 'individual mandate,' that requires people to buy insurance or . face a tax penalty. Manchin, in a Fox News interview on the 'The O'Reilly Factor,' called for a transition year with no fines. 'Let's . work through the problems. We've got a lot of problems, they have been . identified. I think everybody has recognized them. Let's fix it. Let's . get together and fix things,' he said. The comments from the handful of . Democrats posed a new potential hazard for the White House and gave . Republicans a chance to portray their efforts to derail the healthcare . program as bipartisan. Democratic . Senator Mark Pryor of Arkansas, who faces a tough re-election race next . year, said he agreed with fellow Democrat Jeanne Shaheen of New . Hampshire that the open enrollment period to sign up for insurance . should be extended beyond March 31, 2014. Representative . James Clyburn of South Carolina, the third-ranking House Democrat, . criticized the website for forcing consumers to provide private . information before deciding what kind of health insurance plan they want . to buy. 'I've talked to too . many people who tell me before they ever get around to figuring out . what it is they want to buy, they're having to answer questions that . they don't feel they should be answering,' Clyburn said. Administration officials, in damage-control mode for nearly a week, held a closed-door briefing for Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives and a private session with insurance company executives, who said they would assist in efforts to fix the Healthcare.gov website. Websites are the primary vehicle for consumers to shop for insurance through exchanges set up under the healthcare program. Holding Obama to account: House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner tells reporters that Republicans would intensify their investigations into the launch of the 2010 Affordable Care Act . The contractors for the . government's troubled healthcare website sought to deflect blame on . Wednesday as more Democrats voiced concerns about the implementation of . President Barack Obama's signature domestic policy. Meanwhile, Republicans said they would intensify their investigations into the launch of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, known as 'Obamacare.' 'It is our job to hold them accountable, and when it comes to Obamacare clearly there is a lot to hold accountable,' House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner told reporters. The Republican-led House Energy and Commerce Committee will hear today from the top contractors responsible for the program. They included website developer CGI Federal, a unit of Canada's CGI Group Inc, which said in prepared testimony that the software from another contractor designed to allow users to create an account led to early bottlenecks. But the other contractor, United Health Group unit Quality Software Services Inc (QSSI), said in prepared testimony that some of its problems stemmed from a late decision by the administration to require consumers to register for an account before browsing for insurance products. 'This may have driven higher simultaneous usage of the registration system that wouldn't have occurred if consumers could 'window shop' anonymously,' said QSSI. James Clyburn (left), the third-ranking House Democrat, criticised the HealthCare.gov website for forcing consumers to provide private information before deciding what kind of insurance plan they want to buy . Under Obamacare laws, Americans are meant to have insurance coverage from January 1, 2014. But there is a 90-day grace period which gives consumers until the end of March. However, for coverage to take effect in time, you have to enroll by the middle of the month before - so, in this case, around February 15. White House spokesman Jay Carney signalled that changes would be made to tackle this confusing 'disconnect'. The company's software is now keeping pace with demand. Andrew Slavitt, executive vice president with QSSI's parent, said the software has had 'error rates close to zero' since Oct. 8. Obama administration officials, including U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, met with the chief executives of 14 leading insurance companies, including Aetna Inc, WellPoint Inc and Humana Inc. The executives agreed to form new technical teams with the administration to help fix the website, which provide online access to the marketplaces designed to be the main way for millions of uninsured Americans to research and buy health insurance plans under the law. 'We had a candid discussion on the challenges facing the exchange, and the plan that is being put in place to get the program on track,' Aetna Inc spokeswoman Cynthia Michener said. The October 1 debut of the exchanges was marred by technical glitches that have kept many from signing on and making purchases. Those unable to sign up online can call a toll-free telephone number as an alternative. The administration has so far declined to disclose the number of enrollments, either online or by telephone. Shambles: A prolonged delay in getting HealthCare.gov to work could jeopardise White House efforts to sign up as many as 7million people in 2014, the first full year the law takes effect . A chart showing the percentage of  large commercial and government IT projects between 2003 and 2012 that were successful compared to the success rate of IT projects by highly-skilled managers . A delay in getting . Healthcare.gov to work could mean . as many as 7 million people might not get  signed up in 2014, the first full year the law takes . effect. The . administration this week began what it called a 'tech surge,' bringing . in experts led by the administration's top economic aide Jeffrey Zients . to analyze and fix the problems. 'I . think what we learned is they're working hard to fix the problems,' Representative Sander Levin of Michigan, senior Democrat on the House . Ways and Means Committee, said after Wednesday's briefing. The U.S. Health and Human Services Department will begin regular news briefings today to provide updates on 'the progress that's being made and on the efforts that are being undertaken, both to address the technical problems and to make the whole experience for American consumers better,' White House spokesman Jay Carney said. House Democrats said there was no discussion in the briefing about whether the problems should lead to a delay of the individual requirement that every American have insurance or pay a tax penalty. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated a delay would reduce enrollment significantly. Republicans, who have fought the healthcare law as an unwarranted extension of the federal government, said the requirement should be delayed until the problems with the roll-out are resolved. 'With so many unanswered questions and the problems arising around this roll-out, it doesn't make any sense to impose this one percent mandate tax on the American people,' House Majority Leader Eric Cantor told reporters yesterday. Republicans have repeatedly tried to derail or delay the healthcare law since taking control of the House in the 2010 elections. They demanded more answers on Wednesday about the scope of the problems. Three committees in the Republican-controlled House have announced investigations of the law's rollout, which Cantor described as 'nothing short of a debacle.'","Cut-off for getting insurance without penalties to be delayed by six weeks .

"Victim: Health director Loretta Fuddy was named by government sources as the plane crash victim . Hawaii's health director has died after a light aircraft carrying nine people crashed in the sea off the island of Molokai on Wednesday. Loretta Fuddy, who was on an annual visit to the the island, was named as the sole victim in the crash by state government sources. One passenger was able to swim to shore and the others on board the Cessna Grand Caravan were rescued by helicopter and boat. The Makani Kai Air plane, which was scheduled to fly to Honolulu at 3.15pm, went down at about 3.45pm, half a mile northwest of Kalaupapa peninsula, Maui Fire Department spokesman Lee Mainaga said. Ms Fuddy had been booked on the flight along with the health department's deputy director Keith Yamamoto, a spokeswoman for the department said. Two government sources later confirmed to Kitv that Ms Fuddy had died. The 65-year-old, who had won awards for her work with children and social work, had been appointed as director in 2011. Ms Fuddy and Mr Yamamoto had been on an annual visit to Kalaipapa, a former colony for leprosy sufferers. The remote peninsula on the north side of Molokai still houses a settlement for patients with leprosy, which is run by the Health Department. Three of the crash survivors were plucked from the sea by a Coast Guard helicopter and fire crews saved five others. Scroll down for video .

"A Texas couple have told a court they were subjected to harassment by a group of Scientologists, who allegedly taunted them in the street, pointed cameras at their home and sent a sex toy to their office. Monique Rathbun is bringing a lawsuit claiming she suffered emotional distress after a 199-day campaign of harassment that she claims was directed by Scientology leader David Miscavige. She claimed that whenever she or her husband and former Scientologist Marty went outside, a group known as the 'squirrel busters' would approach them and tell Mr Rathbun to stop what he was doing. Court: Monique, pictured with husband Marty Rathbun, claims she suffered emotional distress after being harassed by members of the Scientology church . Mrs Rathbun alleged the harassment was part of a wider three-year campaign against her husband, that began when he left the church in 2009 and started to criticize Mr Miscavige and the way the church was managed. The 41-year-old's husband has advised others who have left the church and given them the same style of counseling offered by Scientology facilities, according to the Tampa Bay Times. The church frowns on people practicing its methods outside of the official community and those who do it are known as squirrels - hence the name for the group of people accused of harassing the Rathbuns. According to Mrs Rathbun, the harassment began when a photo of the couple's home appeared in Scientology magazine Freedom. Complaint: The lawsuit alleges church members known as the Squirrel Busters, who wore T-shirts with Marty Rathbun's head on a squirrel's body, harassed the couple . Shortly after, she claimed she received emails from anonymous accounts telling her to leave her husband and was given a hand-delivered envelope at her office containing secrets about her husband, Radar reported. 'They were trying to . get me to leave him,' she told the court, alleging that she soon became targeted. She claimed several websites were set up saying that she was a man who had a sex operation, which was why the couple couldn't have a baby. Later, a group known as the Squirrel Busters allegedly rented a house near the couple's home and would turn up in a golf buggy, wearing T-shirts showing Mr Rathbun's head on a squirrel's body. 'Every time we left our house, any time . we went out the door, here they came in golf carts,' Mrs Rathbun . said during testimony at Comal County court. Allegations: Scientology leader David Miscavige is named in the lawsuit that claims the couple were harassed . She claimed the church tried to distance her from her husband by allegedly sending private investigators to friends and family, delivering a sex toy anonymously to her office and installing cameras next to their San Antonio home. When the cameras were installed Mrs Rathbun said she decided to sue because 'we just can't keep running'. In court, Mrs Rathbun confirmed to the church's attorney Les Strieber III that no church representative had ever physically assaulted the couple or trespassed on their property. And, although she had seen cameras pointed at their house, Mrs Rathbun had not seen any photos taken. Mr Strieber, who is part of a team representing the seven defendants named in the lawsuit, suggested in court that the couple had infringed on church trademarks through the counseling. Member: Marty Rathbun had been part of the Scientology church until 2009 . The Rathbuns are suing Mr Miscavige, two church entities, three private investigators and one of the Squirrel Busters. The hearing will also seek to determine whether a temporary injunction against Mr Miscavige should be made permanent. Lamont Jefferson, who is representing the church leader, said Scientology had a right to protect its practices and had not broken any laws when it confronted the Rathbuns. The case continues.","Monique Rathbun sues seven people including leader David Miscavige .

"Cash-strapped counties in six states are enrolling inmates in Obamacare health insurance plans as a way to shift costs to the federal government – a tactic that's legal but frustrating for some Republicans who don't want to see the success levels of President Obama's signature law inflated artificially. In many cases jails are registering inmates so they'll be better equipped to access addiction counseling and psychiatric care after their release, lowering the likelihood that they'll return for more time behind bars. The Affordable Care Act prohibits the enrollment of full-time prisoners serving sentences, but many prisoners awaiting trial in prison jumpsuits are being enrolled purely to save county governments money – and shift costs to the feds – when they lengthy hospital stays are required. Obamacare is fast becoming a tool to save counties money that they would otherwise spend on health care for inmates who have not yet been convicted of crimes . The law specifically excludes people who are 'incarcerated, other than incarceration pending the disposition of charges' – legal language referring to the two-thirds of county jail inmates who have been denied bail or can't afford to post a bond to gain release before trial. 'This provision,' says Correctional Risk, Inc., a criminal justice consultancy, 'will likely allow eligible inmates who are pending disposition of charges to enroll in a health insurance plan through their state insurance exchange prior to conviction.' Not everyone thinks this is a good thing, particularly congressional Republicans who want to see the Obamacare law's net cost to he federal government go down, not up. 'We just found out that Obamacare is going to cost $2 trillion over 10 years,' an aide to a Republican senator, who requested anonymity, told MailOnline on Thursday. 'Now we're going to have local governments picking our pockets to pay for their jail inmates? What a disgrace.' 'It makes you wonder,' the Senate staffer said, 'when the president gets excited about enrolling a few million people: How many of them are criminals?' Obamacare excludes convicts, but opens a loophole for officials who want to avoid using their own budgets to help sick prisoners . The $2 trillion figure came from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which issued a report Tuesday covering the economic impacts of the law. Bloomberg reports that nearly 7 million people were incarcerated, paroled or serving probation terms in the U.S. at the end of 2012. And every year about 13 million people – one in every 25 Americans – are booked into county jails each year. On January 28, San Francisco Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi asked the city's Board of Supervisors for permission to sign up inmates for Obamacare as soon as they're fingerprinted and processed. His office estimates that the local government will save $2,500 in the long run for each inmate it enrolls. That's because emergency room visits and treatment for chronic conditions can pile up when patients are uninsured. But since most jailed inmates come from socioeconomic conditions that make them more likely to be sick, their entry into the Obamacare system puts them on equal footing with elderly patients who will take more money out of the system than they put in. Taxpayers in all 50 states will cover the costs for county governments as Obamacare's expenses spiral upward . Even young inmates are as likely to be as sick in the years after their release as older people who have never been in the criminal justice system, according to data from the National institutes of Health. And the large majority who enroll in Medicaid instead of in private health plans will not contribute any money at all toward health care that taxpayers in all 50 states will have to subsidize. And that cost-shifting will include some direct medical care for inmates while they're in custody. In Oregon, Multnomah County Commissioners received a briefing in mid-January learning how much money they could save by putting inmates in Portland and the surrounding communities on Obamacare. They have already applied for Medicaid for 700 inmates, targeting the sickest and most likely to consume county resources when they seek medical care. The estimated $1 million savings from an annual health care bill of $15.7 million doesn't even include a potentially larger windfall from billing Medicaid for inmates' hospital treatments. Obamacare's enrollment statistics will also increase artificially as inmates are enrolled as soon as they are booked and fingerprinted . The Affordable Care Act specifically allows county officials to submit hospital invoices to the federal government when the treatment takes more than 24 hours, but only if the patient is a Medicaid enrollee. County officials estimate that between 70 and 80 per cent of their inmates are eligible. Cook County, Illinois has similar numbers. Its officials have already enrolled about 2,000 prisoners. One former Democratic U.S. senator who debated the Affordable Care Act told Bloomberg that he and his colleagues never intended for Obamacare to cover incarcerated people who are the responsibility of local governments. 'It starts to look a little like a scheme by the states and local jurisdictions to avoid responsibilities that are really theirs,' he said.","Obamacare is fast becoming a tool to save counties money that they would otherwise spend on health care for inmates who have not yet been convicted of crimes .

"Lifetime ban: Samantha Burmis, 46, embarked on an elaborate plot to hide a mortgage fraud conviction after she won an unfair dismissal claim against a school in Kent . A maths teacher who used her daughter’s fingerprints to try to conceal her criminal past has been banned from the classroom for life. Samantha Burmis, 46, embarked on an elaborate plot to hide a mortgage fraud conviction – and resulting prison sentence – after she won an unfair dismissal claim against a school. She had hoped to make £1.2million following the tribunal in 2007, but was awarded only £21,788 because she had failed to declare the 1995 conviction when applying for jobs. Burmis denied she was the same woman who had been jailed for the offence, before enlisting her daughter Nina to provide fingerprints for her. However, Burmis’s plot was exposed because her 25-year-old daughter’s prints were already on file after she was convicted of forging a cheque to pay for a £3,200 breast enlargement. As a result, Burmis was jailed for two years for fraud and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice at Maidstone Crown Court last year. Her daughter was sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment, suspended for two years, for her role in the scam. Burmis, also known as Samantha Virgo, has now been banned from working as a teacher for life after a National College for Teaching and Leadership hearing in Coventry. Professional Conduct Panel chairman Ruth Winterson said a lifetime ban was appropriate considering the seriousness of Burmis’s latest conviction. ‘The panel noted that the serious dishonesty involved in committing the offences could have had an impact on the safety or security of pupils and members of the public,’ she said. ‘The panel has also taken account of how the teaching profession is viewed by others. The panel considered that Ms Virgo’s behaviour in committing the offences could affect the public confidence in the teaching profession given the influence that teachers may have on pupils, parents and others in the community. ‘The panel has noted that Ms Virgo’s behaviour ultimately led to her receiving a sentence of imprisonment which is indicative of the seriousness of the offences committed.’ Burmis is prohibited from teaching at any school, sixth form college, relevant youth accommodation or children’s home in England. The NCTL panel heard that Burmis was jailed for two years in 1995 after she was convicted of a £90,000 mortgage fraud at Harrow Crown Court. After serving a year of the sentence, she studied law at the University of Kent, before training to be a teacher. When she applied for a post at Aylesford School in Kent in 2001, she failed to declare the conviction. She was sacked from the school in 2005. Burmis then went on to work at two other schools in Kent, Homewood School in Tenterden and Swadelands School in Lenham, where she also failed to declare her criminal past. She later made a successful unfair dismissal claim against Aylesford School, but she received a smaller payout than she had hoped because she had failed to declare her fraud conviction when applying for jobs. Burmis was jailed for two years for fraud and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice at Maidstone Crown Court, pictured, last year. She has now been banned from working as a teacher for life . She then went to Kent Police to claim she had been wrongly identified as the person with the 1995 fraud conviction. When an independent expert arrived at her home to take her prints so they could be verified, her daughter answered with her face concealed. She offered her mother’s driving licence and gave her own fingerprints. However, Kent Police already had her prints on file. The mother and daughter were found guilty by a jury at Maidstone Crown Court. Burmis was convicted of obtaining a pecuniary advantage by deception in relation to money earned through teaching, and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. Nina Burmis was convicted of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.","Samantha Burmis hoped to make £1.2m after winning unfair dismissal claim .

"Picking faces out of a crowd is something humans are hardwired to do, but training computers to act in the same way is much more difficult. There have been various breakthroughs in this field in recent months, but the latest could be the most significant yet. Researchers from Yahoo Labs and Stanford University have developed an algorithm that can identify faces from various different angles, when part of the face is hidden and even upside down. The Deep Dense Face Detector algorithm was built by Yahoo Labs in California and Stanford University. The researchers used a form of machine learning known as a deep convolutional neural network to train a computer to spot facial features (pictured) in a database of images . At the moment, the so-called Deep Dense Face Detector doesn't recognise who the individual faces belong to, just that there is a face. But the technology has the potential to be trained in this way. The algorithm was built by Sachin Farfade and Mohammad Saberian at Yahoo Labs in California and Li-Jia Li at Stanford University. The Yahoo algorithm was developed using a form of machine learning known as a deep convolutional neural network. This involves training a computer to recognise elements of images from a database using various layers. A team of Google researchers recently developed an advanced image classification and detection algorithm called GoogLeNet, which similarly used this technique. It is so accurate it can locate and distinguish between a range of object sizes within a single image, and it can also determine an object within, or on top of, an object, within the photo. The Google researchers began by training neural networks to carry out the recognition tasks similar to how the human brain works. This helps the software learn the shape and size of different objects, no matter how small, and be able to recognise them in the future. A more detailed explanation is available from the Google Research Blog. It built on the Viola-Jones algorithm which spots front-facing people in images by picking out key facial features such as a vertical nose and shadows around the eyes. By collecting these markers, the algorithm is able to determine if an image contains a face or not. But, this did not account for faces that have been obscured, are looking in various directions, or were upside down. With this in mind, Mr Farfade and his team used a form of machine learning known as a deep convolutional neural network. This involves training a computer to recognise elements of images from a database using various layers. Google used a similar technique for its recent GoogLeNet classification algorithm that can identify images within images, such as a hat on the head of a dog sat on a bench. Mr Farfade trained his algorithm using a database of 200,000 images featuring faces shown at various angles and orientations, plus 20 million images that didn't contain faces. In their paper, the researchers said: 'In this paper we propose a method based on deep learning, called Deep Dense Face Detector.' 'It has minimal complexity...and can get similar or better performance [than other systems] while it does not require annotation or information about facial landmarks.' And, the team said the technology could be improved following further training. The algorithm (recognition pictured left) can identify faces from various different angles, when part of the face is hidden and even upside down (example pictured right). At the moment, the technology doesn't recognise who a face belongs to, but could be trained to do so . Google used a similar neural network technique for its recent GoogLeNet classification algorithm that can identify images within images, such as a hat on the head of a dog (pictured) Facebook's Deep Face tool also used this neural network technique to help recognise users in photos. Its algorithm identifies faces 'as accurately as a human' and offers tag suggestions which the user can accept, or reject. The technology  was first showcased last March, but the site has now started rolling out the automatic tagging tool to select users. DeepFace uses technology designed by an Israeli startup called face.com. Google's technology is so accurate it can locate and distinguish between a range of object sizes within a single image, and it can also determine an object within, or on top of, an object, within the photo (pictured) Facebook's Deep Face tool also used this neural network technique to help recognise users in photos. Its algorithm identifies faces 'as accurately as a human' and uses a 3D model to virtually rotate faces so they are facing the camera. Image (a) shows the original image and (g) shows the final, corrected version . Facebook bought the startup in 2013 and developed the facial recognition tool with support from face.com's Yaniv Taigman at its Artificial Intelligence lab. The researchers used the software to build a 3D model of a face from a photo that can be rotated into the best position for an algorithm to begin searching for a match. After creating a model, the team used a neural network that had been trained on a database of faces to try and match the face with one in a test database of more than 4 million images, containing more than 4,000 separate identities, each one labelled by humans. Its creators said DeepFace finds a match with 97.25 per cent accuracy. The tagging option has now started appearing in the privacy settings of accounts globally - although in many cases it still says the feature is 'unavailable' - and a number of users have reportedly been given the tool. Facebook uses Deep Face to offer tag suggestions which the user can accept, or reject.

"John Lewis boss Andy Street has apologised for saying that in France 'nothing works and nobody cares', but the latest data seems to prove him right . While John Lewis boss Andy Street has backtracked on his claim that France is 'hopeless and downbeat', the latest economic data shows he may be right after all. The country was branded the 'sick man of the world' yesterday after figures for September showed output fell for the fifth month in a row as businesses continued to shed jobs. Analysts said it pointed towards another quarter of stagnation, following six months of zero growth between January and June. John Lewis boss Andy Street was forced to apologise after saying that in France 'nothing works and worse, nobody cares about it', but some analyists have agreed with his outlook. Chris . Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: ‘No longer just the sick . man of Europe, France looks more like the sick man of the world.’ The . ‘increasingly bloated’ public sector ‘has masked the dismal performance . of the private sector where businesses are struggling,’ he said. Official figures show the French economy – the second largest in Europe . behind Germany’s – is 1.2 per cent bigger than at its pre-crisis peak in . early 2008. But when government spending is stripped out, output is . still 1.7 per cent below those levels. ‘France’s private sector is . technically back in recession,’ said Mr Williamson. ‘Even other euro . area countries are coping much better than France. Europe is being held . back by its second-largest economy.’ Markit’s report said that . during September, businesses axed jobs at the fastest pace for 16 . months. Unemployment in France remains stuck above 10 per cent, with . more than three million people out of work. Scroll down for video . As well as rising unemployment, falling inflation and stagnant growth, France is also being governed by the most unpopular leader in its history . Diego Iscaro, senior . economist at research group IHS Global Insight, said: ‘The French . economy is struggling. It stagnated during the first half of the year . and the outlook is hardly better. 'Near record-high unemployment is . keeping private consumption, the traditional engine of French growth, . under intense pressure. 'Meanwhile, firms are reluctant to invest amid a . backdrop of falling profitability and increasing concerns about the . economic outlook.’ Added to the economic woes is the fact that France is currently being lead by the most unpopular leader in its history. Several high-profile scandals, including a messy break-up with his long-term partner Valerie Trierweiler following claims of an affair with actress Julie Gayet, have badly hurt President Hollande. The failure of his socialist party to govern effectively has also lead to the rapid rise of the far-right nationalist party, led by Marine Le Pen. After dealing a series of heavy blows to Hollande in local elections,her party recently seized its first two seats in the country's senate.","New data shows French economy has stagnated and may be in recession .

"Harry Kane scored with the final kick of the game as Tottenham fought back from two goals down to draw with West Ham. Cheikhou Kouyate and Diafra Sakho gave the Hammers what appeared to be comfortable lead but Spurs fought back first through Danny Rose and then Kane. Here, Sportsmail gives their player ratings. Tottenham captain Lloris makes a superb save from Enner Valencia to keep the score at 1-0 . TOTTENHAM (4-2-3-1) Hugo Lloris - 7 . Kept Tottenham in the game with superb saves at 1-0 down and 2-0 down. The Hammers would have been out of sight had it not been for Tottenham's captain. Kyle Walker - 5.5 . Both opposition goals came from crosses down his flank. Still a long way off his best but attacked well late on. Eric Dier - 5 . Poor positioning for the opening goal, failed to impress thereafter. Struggling to recapture his early season form. Jan Vertonghen - 5.5 . Like most of his team, not his best game. Occasionally looked a little flat-footed when balls were played in behind him. Jan Vertonghen indicates he thinks midfielder Mark Noble deserves a second yellow card . Danny Rose - 6.5 . Could have done better for Sakho's goal - called for offside instead of playing to the whistle. Did manage to score though, his goal riled up the crowd and sparked the comeback. Ryan Mason - 5 . Struggled to exert himself on the game against an impressive West Ham midfield . Nabil Bentaleb - 5.5 . Against Arsenal, he and Mason ran the show but Song, Noble and Kouyate didn't afford them the same luxury. Andros Townsend - 5 . Cresswell dealt with him well. Never got a chance to use his pace and was hauled off after an hour. Danny Rose strikes to pull one back for Tottenham with 10 minutes remaining in the match in north London . Mousa Dembele - 4.5 . His error led to the opening goal and was subbed at half time. Even with the ending, probably not a day he'll look back on fondly. Erik Lamela - 5.5 . Could have easily been substituted at half time instead of Dembele. Did not justify Pochettino's decision to start him ahead of Eriksen. Harry Kane - 7 . Looked frustrated for the majority of the game but kept trying and was rewarded with a penalty and a goal late on. Great strikers can score even when fed on scraps, Kane did that today. Subs: Eriksen - 6, Soldado - 5.5, Chadli - 6. Mauricio Pochettino - 5.5 . Tottenham were poor, the Argentine claimed after the match his team deserved more than a draw - they didn't even deserve that. Harry Kane missed the penalty but scored the rebound with the final kick of the game on Sunday afternoon . WEST HAM (4-3-3) Adrian - 5 . Should have done better for Rose's goal. Saved Kane's penalty late on but the rebound fell straight to the Spurs striker. Carl Jenkinson - 6 . Quiet game from the on-loan defender. Didn't have much joy going forward but solid defensively. James Tomkins - 6 . Kept Kane quiet for most of the game, not much he could do about either of Tottenham's goals. Winston Reid - 6 . Made a superb challenge on Kane in the first half to prevent a goal. Like Tomkins, not at fault for either goal . Defensive midfielders Song of West Ham and Nabil Bentaleb of Tottenham during the second half . Aaron Cresswell - 6.5 . Good going forward, provided the assist for the first goal (his fourth of the season). Unlucky not to be on the winning side. Alex Song - 6 . Really solid performance for the first 95 minutes of the match. Dominated the midfield with his team-mates. But a rush of blood to the head in the final 60 seconds cost his team the win. Cheikhou Kouyate - 7 . Great performance from the 25-year-old. Scored a goal and dominated the midfield with Song. Mark Noble - 7 . Assisted the second goal and played well but could have easily been sent off. Substituted in the second half to avoid that eventuality and it is no coincidence that Tottenham's comeback began shortly after. Tottenham midfielder Mousa Demebele attempts to evade opposite number Mark Noble at White Hart Lane . Enner Valencia - 6 . Denied a goal by a brilliant save from Lloris and struggled to make an impact thereafter. Could have scored in the second half but Sakho chose not to square it for a tap-in. Stewart Downing - 6 . Solid, if unspectacular. A Stewart Downing performance if ever there was one. Some nice passing, worked hard tracking back but nothing to get the crowd off their feet. Diafra Sakho - 6.5 . A confusing performance. His goal was brilliantly taken - a half-volley from a remarkably tight angel. All of his easier chances, however, he failed to take advantage of. Subs: Cole - 5, Jarvis - 5.5, Collins 5.5. Sam Allardyce - 7 . So unfortunate to only come away with a point, Allardyce got his tactics spot on but were undone by a bizarre goal from Rose and a late penalty. Cheikhou Kouyate leaps in between Tottenham's central defender's to head home the opening goal .","Tottenham and West Ham drew 2-2 at White Hart Lane on Sunday .

"Anger: This poster led to North Korean officials demanding that the west London salon that produced it should take it down - they have now asked the Foreign Office to intervene . It is the must-have hairdo in North Korea. In fact it is the only style approved by communist dictator Kim Jong-un. The Supreme Leader decreed last month that all young men should follow his short back and sides with centre parting – or face severe punishment. But Kim clearly did not expect his edict to be taken up thousands of miles from Pyongyang in a leafy London suburb. So when his agents saw a promotional poster in a hair salon featuring their leader and his distinctive crop, they leapt furiously into action. The North Korean officials marched in demanding the ‘disrespectful’ advert be taken down. However, the salon manager took fright at their threatening behaviour and called the police. Mo Nabbach, who runs M&M Hair Academy in South Ealing, told officers that he feared for his livelihood after using the picture as a joke to promote a discount for men’s haircuts. He chose the photograph following the dictator’s much publicised edict that all male students in the rogue state must have the same razor-short look. Below the large image of the tyrant, the poster reads: ‘Bad Hair Day? 15% off all gent cuts through the month of April’. It had been in the salon window for only one day before he received a sinister visit from the North Korean officials, whose embassy is less than two miles away in a converted semi in Gunnersbury. Mr Nabbach said: 'I noticed them first outside the shop. 'They came in and asked what the poster was doing in the window and demanded for it to be taken down. 'I said it was only a poster and we have pictures of celebrities in the window all the time. They said: ""This is no celebrity, it's our dear leader"". 'They asked for my name and I refused to give it to them, saying ""this is not North Korea, this is England, and you can get out"". Scroll down for video . Row: The owners of this London salon say their decision to promote an April discount using a picture of Kim Jong-un has led to the manager being put under surveillance by North Korean officials . 'They left and I called the police just in case they ended up smashing the windows. 'We did take it down but then some of our clients told me to put it back up because we have a democracy here'. The two men in suits entered the salon at 4.30pm last Friday bearing a clipboard. They confronted Mr Nabbach’s 26-year-old hairdresser son Karim, demanding to know who was responsible for the perceived outrage. ‘The irony is they didn’t even have the Kim Jong-un haircut, they just had a standard side parting,’ said Mr Nabbach, 51. ‘To tell you the truth, it was actually a bit scary. From all the stuff you hear about North Korea, it was worrying. The two guys were wearing suits and they were very serious. It was very threatening. They came in and asked what the poster was doing in the window and demanded for it to be taken down. - Salon owner Mo Nabbach . ‘I said it was only a poster and we have pictures of celebrities in the window all the time. ‘They . said, “We are North Korean officials, do you know this is our leader?”. They asked for my name. I told them, “This is not North Korea, this is . England, we live in a democracy so I’m afraid you’re going to have to . get out of my salon”.’ The pair left after taking notes and . photographs of the premises. Mr Nabbach went to Ealing police station to . report the matter. Scotland Yard revealed today the North Koreans did the . same. He initially removed the poster, fearing that either he or the shop could be targeted. But . following complaints from customers and locals about a ‘breach of . democracy’, the poster was put back up, prompting a further visit at . 10am the next day. A communist official stood outside taking photographs of the salon until Karim chased him off. Mr Nabbach took the poster down after the men left, but he has replaced it after comments on Facebook saying the request to take it down was a 'breach of democracy'. He said: 'The funny thing is, it's not a bad haircut if he styled it correctly. 'Lots of men are walking around with hair shaved short at the back and the sides, long on the top and big beards - in fact it's quite like my own style, though it's all about the face shape.' Diplomatic incident: Barber Karim Nabbach says his brother Mo was forced to go the police because the rogue state's officials put him under surveillance . Distinctive: North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's hair was declared 'bad' by the Ealing salon, which led to intervention from his agents . His barber son Karim, 26, designed the . post and said: 'We put up posters for an offer for men's hair cuts . through the month of April. Obviously in the current news there has been . this story that North Korean men are only allowed one haircut. 'We . didn't realise but the North Korean embassy is a 10 minute walk from . the salon. The next day we had North Korean officials pop into the salon . asking to speak to the manager. 'The . men were a bit stern and abrupt, it was all a bit weird. The funny . thing is, none of them had the Kim Jong-Un hair-cut, they all had normal . styles. 'Being over here, they have the freedom to wear their hair any way they like, yet they are trying to tell us what to do.' Customer Helen Bajaj, who has been using the salon for 20 years, was one . of the people who urged Mr Nabbach to keep the poster up. She said: 'I posted on the Facebook group about freedom of speech and a friend posted about the freedom to have a laugh. 'I think the poster's cool, it's Mo down to a T. I'm so proud of him for keeping it up.' A North Korean embassy spokesman said they could not comment on the story. State headquarters: North Korea's embassy is based inside this semi in Gunnersbury, west London, and officials have asked the Foreign Office intervene in a row with a local barbers . A Met Police spokesman said: 'We have spoken to all parties involved and no offence has been disclosed'. While M&M . Hair Academy consider Kim Jong-un's hair 'bad', the North Korean leader . is currently forcing all male students in North Korea to get the same . haircut. Last month his government announced that the only haircut allowed . would be the 'Dear Leader' style favoured by Kim Jong-Un. His father Kim Jong-il's hair was given extra volume, apparently to make him look taller. His son's new hair regulation constitutes a clampdown, as previously men had ten styles to choose from. Women had a menu of 18 haircuts to choose from. In 2005 North Korean state TV launched a five part series entitled . 'Let us trim our hair in accordance with Socialist lifestyle' with the . aim of promoting neat haircuts. The . TV show sent out teams with hidden cameras to catch 'rebels' who were breaking the North Korean strict hairstyle code.

"Facebook has changed its rules to allow users to post photos of breastfeeding. Following a major online  campaign called #freethenipple, it has been revealed the social network changed ts policy - but has not explained why. Mothers took to the internet to complain after it was discovered breastfeeding photos were being banned. Mothers can now post breastfeeding pictures of themselves on Facebook following a change in policy . In answer tho the question 'Does Facebook allow photos of mothers breastfeeding?' the site revealed its policy change. It's answer reads: . 'Yes. We agree that breastfeeding is natural and beautiful and we're glad to know that it's important for mothers to share their experiences with others on Facebook. 'The vast majority of these photos are compliant with our policies. 'Please note that the photos we review are almost exclusively brought to our attention by other Facebook members who complain about them being shared on Facebook.' Today it emerged Facebook changed its policy three weeks ago, updating a question in the sites help section to read: 'We agree that breastfeeding is natural and beautiful and we're glad to know that it's important for mothers to share their experiences with others on Facebook. 'The vast majority of these photos are compliant with our policies.' It claims that many of the removals were actually due to complaints from other users. 'Please note that the photos we review are almost exclusively brought to our attention by other Facebook members who complain about them being shared on Facebook.' To test the new rules, US parenting blogger Paala Secor posted a photo of her breastfeeding to her 4,655 Facebook followers, in which her nipple was exposed. Less than a day after she released the photo, Facebook unpublished her page and warned it could be deleted, Secor explained on her personal blog. She later received an apology from the website in which a member of the Community Operations  team admitted the page had been accidentally' removed. She welcomed the changes. 'Seeing breastfeeding is important, as is being able to share those images without fear of scorn or deletion,' she wrote. 'Facebook has finally updated their policy regarding breastfeeding images,' 'They now match most state laws that specifically allow nipple exposure during breastfeeding. Exposure during breastfeeding doesn’t constitute indecent exposure. 'Why is this important? Basically, Facebook is slowly but surely realizing that women, or at least breastfeeding mothers at this time, are allowed to live in their own skin and share images of themselves topless (and breastfeeding) without being deleted for nudity.' A photo resent by multiple users in the ""free the nipple"" campaign #freethenipple - which has now led to Facebook changing its policies. Alongside the picture, Secor wrote: 'We are proud to nourish our babies with our breasts and we will not be shamed for it. 'We will share our special/difficult/funny/priceless breastfeeding moments with our friends, families, and community and we will not to told [sic] to keep them to ourselves.' Francesca Entwistle, a leader of Unicef's the National Infant Feeding Network and Midwifery Lecturer at the University of Hertfordshire, told the Independent: 'It’s good that Facebook have finally responded to the concerns of users who wanted nothing more than to capture shared moments with their babies, and we hope that this new policy helps reduce the stigma around images of breastfeeding,'","Facebook quietly changed policy three weeks ago .

"After it was revealed yesterday that an increasing number of women are using the sex industry to pay their way through university, one woman has told her story of stripping while studying. Emma Green, of Glamorgan, Wales, turned to stripping on a webcam for men and earned £200-a-week to fund her studies. The 25-year-old, who studied multi-media design at Glamorgan University before spending another year at a beauty therapy college in 2009, says a normal part-time job was out of the question because of her intense course workload. Desperate measures: Emma Green, who is also a glamour model in South Wales and started webcam stripping to pay for her uni fees . Career change: After studying multi-media design at Glamorgan University and studying beauty therapy, Emma still  now works for the webcam company . ‘I loved both courses, but there were no grants, no funding. Nothing. I literally had nothing to live on’, she told The Sun. Emma spoke out after the National Union of Students warned that as well as sex work, students are turning to gambling and medical experiments to pay for their education. Emma said some weeks she was living on as little as £40 before stripping and after claiming a student loan, she found herself buried in debt. A friend told her about the webcam work and informed her that all she needed was a computer with a camera . ‘It seemed too good to be true so I tried it out and I must admit the first time I was nervous and didn’t make much money,’ Emma told the newspaper. ‘But after a few goes and the initial shock of going topless and stripping down to my thong, I began to get used to it’, she added. Part time work: Emma worked for two to three hours, four nights a week, and earned £200 per week from webcam stripping . Miss Green, who now works for Britain’s Got Webcams, says she would strip for two to three hours a night each week – earning between £16 and £20 per hour. Glamour girl: Emma posing in a Nuts T-shirt at home . The wage was enough to pay her fees and Emma, who lives with her parents in Glamorgan, says she still now earns £200 a week with the company. She says she’ll stop stripping once she finds a full time job but says there are none available at the moment for young people. Emma said: ‘I earn my own money and I’m getting through this recession in the best way I can without having to live off the state.’ Government reforms mean universities can start charging up to £9,000 annually in tuition fees from next year. In addition, the education maintenance allowance (EMA) for 16 to 19-year-olds has been scrapped. It is these reforms that are causing students to turn to the 'informal' sector for money, according to the NUS. Estelle Hart, the NUS national women’s officer, told BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast: 'Students are taking more dangerous measures. 'In an economic climate where there . are very few jobs, where student support has been massively cut, people . are taking more work in the informal economy, such as sex work. 'It’s all dangerous unregulated work, simply so people can stay in education. The NUS also told BBC 5 live Breakfast it estimated about 20 per cent of women working in lap dancing clubs were students. A . Department for Education spokesman said: 'We are targeting £180 million . a year financial support at the most vulnerable 16 to 19-year-olds to . help them continue their studies - with transitional funding for the . students who were getting the top rate of EMA and partway through their . studies. 'It is down to schools and colleges themselves to award bursaries to young people who need the most help. 'If students are really struggling financially, they need to speak directly to their tutors.' A . spokesman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said: . 'Under the current university funding system, no student has to pay in . advance for tuition. Battling the recession: Emma says she'll continue stripping until she can find a full time job, but says there aren't any for young people at the moment and she's just getting through the recession . Independent woman: Emma says she doing her best to earn her own money without having to live off the state . 'There is a generous package of financial support . to help with living costs in the form of loans and non-repayable . grants. 'Our reforms will . make the system even fairer, with more financial support and lower . monthly repayments once you are in well-paid work.' A spokesman for the NUS said although they did not have any quantitative evidence, they backed Ms Hart's comments. 'Anecdotally we are seeing a lot more of this and when you combine this with other reports there does seem to be an increase (in students working in the sex industry),' he said. 'We don't have any quantitative basis to back it up but we are confident to say this is an increasing problem. 'This hasn't originated from us but we are very confident standing by what Estelle said to 5 Live.'","She is forced to continue stripping because 'there are no jobs for young people at the moment'

"Barcelona have taken the first step towards getting rid of paper tickets by introducing a new system involving supporters using their smartphones to gain access to the Nou Camp. Instead of now having to print out tickets before the match, Barca fans will now be able to scan a bar-code on their phones to gain access to matches. The Catalan giants, who are currently second in La Liga, say the new system is already up and running and available for fans to use.

This picture shows a tiny baby limosa harlequin frog, an endangered species native to Panama, sitting atop a U.S. quarter coin. Researchers have successfully bred the chevron-patterned variety for the first time . 'The last hope for their species': The Panama Amphibian Rescue and Conservation Project is raising nine healthy frogs from one mating pair and hundreds of tadpoles from another pair . Threatened: Habitat loss, climate change, pollution, and a virulent fungal disease called chytridiomycosis are all thought to have contributed to the loss of 94 of 120 frog species since as late as 1980 . 'These frogs represent the last hope for their species,' said Brian Gratwicke of the Smithsonian Biology Institute, international coordinator for the conservation project, in a statement. 'This new generation is hugely inspiring to us as we work to conserve and care for this species and others.' With nearly one-third of the world's amphibian species at risk of extinction, the project aims to save frog species in Panama, one of the world's last remaining strongholds for amphibian biodiversity.

Complicated needs: Each species requires its own special care to thrive and breed, with researchers having only limited success in encouraging the plain-coloured form to multiply . It is hoped that methodologies may be developed to reduce the impact of the amphibian chytrid fungus so that one day their captive communities can be returned to the wild . The Panama rescue project currently cares for 55 adult limosa harlequin frogs of the chevron-patterned form and a further ten of the plain-coloured form at two research centres in the Central American country. Each species requires its own special care to thrive and breed, with researchers having only limited success in encouraging the plain-coloured form to multiply. Both kinds need highly oxygenated, gently flowing warm water between 22C and 24C for their tadpoles to survive. Their natural food is algal film growing on submerged rocks, which researchers replicated by painting petri dishes with a solution of powdered spirulina algae and then allowing it to dry. It is hoped that one day the teams working for the project may develop methodologies to reduce the impact of the amphibian chytrid fungus so that one day their captive communities can be returned to the wild.","Limosa harlequin frogs are under threat from habitat loss and disease .

"Charged: Suicidal former business executive Robert Dellinger, pictured, slammed his pickup truck into an SUV on a North Hampshire highway Saturday, killing a pregnant woman and her fiance, a father-of-three . A suicidal former hotshot businessman slammed his pickup truck into an SUV on a North Hampshire highway on Saturday, killing a pregnant woman and her fiance, a father-of-three. Robert Dellinger, 53, is charged with two counts of reckless manslaughter in connection with the horrific crash, which left 29-year-old Jason Timmons, 24-year-old Amanda Murphy and their unborn baby dead. Prosecutors said Dellinger's truck crossed the median on Interstate 89, became airborne and sheared off the top of the couple's car, killing the pair, who met while working at an old person's home, instantly. The medical examiner's report said the injuries they suffered were consistent with a plane crash. Dellinger, of Sunapee, was arraigned by video Wednesday. He sat at a table and stared down for most of the proceeding. His wife, sons and about a dozen other supporters left court without speaking to reporters. Dellinger served as senior vice president and chief financial officer at Fortune 500 company PPG Industries Inc. He took a severance package worth more than $1 million in cash plus stocks when he left in 2011 because of health reasons, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Dellinger, who also held top-level posts at Sprint Corp., Delphi Corp. and General Electric Co., bought a home on Sunapee Lake in November 2012, according to property records. Susan Morrell, senior assistant attorney general for New Hampshire, said Dellinger argued with his wife over his medications on the morning of the crash. Tragic: Dellinger is charged with two counts of reckless manslaughter in connection with the horrific crash, which left 29-year-old Jason Timmons, left, 24-year-old Amanda Murphy, right, and their unborn baby dead . Reagan: An ultrasound shows Amanda Murphy and Jason Timmons' unborn baby, who they were going to call Reagan Elizabeth . He left the house and began to drive around, growing increasingly despondent, she said. A trooper said Dellinger told him he intended to kill himself. 'He was driving around, depressed and loopy,' Morrell said. 'He saw the median and decided to turn into it.' Morrell noted the portion of median Dellinger chose had no trees, rocks or other obstacles. 'He could have chosen many other ways to kill himself that would not put anyone else in danger,' she said. Dellinger's lawyer, R. Peter Decato, called the state's comments 'over the top' and said Dellinger had led a 'productive and exemplary life.' He argued for low bail for Dellinger. A judge ordered Dellinger held on $250,000 cash bail, which his family were expected to post Wednesday. Dellinger also will have to get a . mental health evaluation, wear an electronic monitor, surrender his . passport and driver's licenses and not drive a car. Father: According to Valley News, Timmons, pictured, was a father of three children, including this cutie, already. This was Murphy's first child . Angry: Friends expressed their anger and devastation on Timmons' brother Ray Blanchard's page, claiming Dellinger should have been charged with three counts of manslaughter . He'll have to stay in New Hampshire despite a request by his lawyer to allow him to travel for mental health treatment in Kansas, where he has property. Timmons and Murphy got engaged in March this year, according to Timmons' Facebook account. They lived in Wilder, Vermont, and met while working at valley Terrace Assisted Living Facility. Timmons has three children from another relationship, Faith, Aubrey and Gavin Timmons. He enjoyed the outdoors, especially fishing with his fiance, the Valley News reported. Friends expressed their anger and devastation on Timmons' brother Ray Blanchard's page, claiming Dellinger should have been charged with three counts of manslaughter. Blanchard's girlfriend wrote on his behalf on December 8: 'As some of you may already know we lost two amazing individuals that we were so blessed to be apart of their lives ..we also lost the chance to meet lil Raegan .. Jasons brother Ray is unable to respond but my kids and I will send him your thoughts if anyone would like to write to him please feel free I will give you his address.... RIP !!! Jason Timmons and Amanda Murphy .... We all love you so much !!' Arraignment: Robert J. Dellinger, was is arraigned by video at Lebanon District Court in Lebanon, New Hampshire, on December 11, a few days after the crash . Amanda Murphy was very excited to be a mother for the first time, and the couple had already named their daughter Reagan Elizabeth. Catherine Amarante, executive director at the care facility, where Murphy was lead caregiver said of the pair, 'He certainly was very, very loving, as was she. She really wanted to have this baby.' She added to the New Hampshire Union Leader that the facility held a baby shower for Murphy last Wednesday and she was 'glowing.' 'So it's shocking. We're still in shock,' she said. 'We deal with death in elders, and that's hard in and of itself, but this is totally different.' Amarante said Murphy was trustworthy, intuitive, and worked well with dementia patients. Timmons was 'a gentle giant.' 'Just a big tall guy and a really, really good caregiver and really loved by the patients and staff,' she said.","Robert Dellinger, 53, of Sunapee, North Hampshire, is charged with two counts of reckless manslaughter in Saturday's crash .

"A boyfriend proposed to his girlfriend when he had just six months to live - then spent the rest of his days making his bride’s dreams come true. Chris Price, 26, promised to give 'love of his life' Ceri, 29, everything she ever wished for after he was diagnosed with terminal cancer. The pair had a plush church wedding with Ceri’s four children as the guests of honour. Chris Price proposed to his girlfriend Ceri when he had just six months to live, and then spent the rest of his days making her dreams come true . Chris then took her and four children Halle, nine, and triplets Evan, Morgan and Georgia, six, to Disneyland Paris. And they had only been home a few weeks when he whisked Ceri off to New York for a weekend of sightseeing and shopping. Chris then splashed out on the £500 pair of Louboutin shoes - and a £900 Mulberry handbag Ceri had always wanted. The pair had a plush church wedding with Ceri's four children as the guests of honour . The loving husband then booked to take Ceri to Las Vegas for her birthday... but sadly he ran out of time. Chris died in Ceri’s arms last month and his funeral was held in the church where the pair had married just six months earlier. Heartbroken Ceri said: 'It was as if Chris wanted to spend his last days making me as happy as he could. 'We did such a lot in those last six months. Chris had proposed to Ceri when he had just six months to live and promised to give her everything she ever wished for . 'He was so positive he never talked about dying, he just wanted to see me and the children happy in the time he had left.' Ceri told how maintenance inspector Chris loved to surprise her and his four stepchildren. She said: 'The Disney trip was something we had talked about in the future but when Chris knew he didn’t have long he booked for all of us to go. 'Then he told me he’d arranged a romantic trip for us in Dublin but on the way to the airport he told me we were going to New York. 'We had the most magical time and I will savour those memories forever. 'He knew I had fancied a pair of Louboutin boots but they were way too expensive for me to ever afford them. 'But Chris bought them for me and got me an even more expensive Mulberry handbag.' Chris took her and four children Halle, nine, and triplets Evan, Morgan and Georgia, six, to Disneyland Paris after the wedding . The pair had known each other since being teenagers - and moved in together when romance blossomed in January 2012. Chris was fit and healthy - and hadn’t been to see his doctor for more than 10 years. But he started having stomach pains and tests revealed he had cancer of the oesophagus in April 2012. Though Chris was given the all clear, his cancer returned a year later . Chris, of Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales, underwent an eight-hour operation where doctors had to remove part of his stomach because the cancer had spread. He was later given the all clear but in April 2013 scans revealed secondary cancer in his liver and lungs. He was told there was no cure but chemotherapy could prolong his life. He passed away in January 2014. Ceri said: 'If my love could have saved him, he would have lived forever. 'We packed so much into the short time we had together. 'His illness made him live completely in the moment and he taught me to do the same. 'He died in my arms and I felt his last breath. 'My heart is broken losing him and I still spray his Aramis aftershave and wear his clothes to feel close to him. 'He loved me and took me on with four children as if they were his own. They loved him so much too.' Brave Ceri said that although she has been left heartbroken she will always treasure the last six months of happiness they had together. She said: 'I have no regrets - we accepted what was going to happen and we savoured every single second we had together. 'At his funeral we played his favourite song Robin S - Show Me Love. 'That’s all he ever did was show everyone he met love. I miss him every moment of every day.' Chris tragically passed away in January: 'All he ever did was show everyone he met love. I miss him every moment of every day,' says Ceri .","Chris was diagnosed with cancer of the oesophagus in April 2012 .

Middlesbrough left back George Friend is interesting West Brom and Crystal Palace. The 27-year-old has been a consistent performer for Aitor Karanka's side this season. And his displays have caught the eye of both Tony Pulis and Alan Pardew. Sportsmail's Simon Jones reports: QPR asking for Fraizer Campbell as part of Jordon Mutch deal with Crystal Palace. More to follow. Sportsmail's Simon Jones reports: . Wigan manager Malky Mackay was among spectators at Leigh on Monday night as Manchester United U21s beat Liverpool U21s 2-1. Mackay is keen to see what is available on loan with United's Nick Powell and Jesse Lingard among those being considered. As reported earlier in the day by Sportsmail's Craig Hope, Newcastle are closing in on the signings of Spain Under-19 internationals Jorge Mere and David Concha. QPR misfit Adel Taarabt has had hopes raised that he could yet secure a return to AC Milan. The Italians are looking for replacements after Stephan El Shaarawy broke a metatarsal in his right foot, ruling him out for two months. Taarabt had a productive loan spell at the San Siro last season and has been keen to return. Sportsmail understands Manchester City and James Milner have not yet given up on reaching an agreement that would see the midfielder extend his stay in Manchester. Negotiations are set to re-open in the near future and much will depend upon assurances over playing time. Milner's contract runs out in the summer and he has been linked with Liverpool and Arsenal. Sportsmail's Jack Gaughan reports: . Wigan are surprisingly cutting their losses on Adam Forshaw, who is putting the finishing touches on a move to Championship rivals Middlesbrough. The midfielder only signed for the Latics in August, with the club set to lose out on millions as a result of the player not settling and struggling under Malky Mackay. Tottenham defender Vlad Chiriches is the subject of renewed interest from Roma. The deal has been bubbling for several months and the Italians have made contact again with the Romanian's representatives. Tottenham dismissed reports on Monday that they were being offered Mattia Destro as part of a deal and the likelihood is Roma will make an offer to loan Chiriches with a permanent deal to follow. West Ham midfielder Ravel Morrison is due in Rome today ahead of a medical with Lazio. The 21-year-old has agreed to join the club in the summer and is due to sign a pre-contract if all goes to plan. Morrison has been offered a four year contract. Stay tuned for the first pictures of the maverick midfielder in Italy... Joel Campbell has joined Villarreal on loan until the end of the season - and has posed for his first pictures at his new club. On Sunday, Campbell said: 'This means a lot to me, I am very excited with this new opportunity and I hope to sign the contract tomorrow. Hull City have failed in an ambitious bid to sign Alexandre Pato on loan. The 25-year-old Brazil striker has also been offered to Everton in recent days while QPR manager Harry Redknapp said his club could not afford the deal. Steve Bruce was eager to tie up a short term loan but Pato's wages of around £60,000 a week are a big hurdle to overcome. Dnipro driector Andriy Stenstenko has revealed that the club's star player Yevhen Konoplyanka is on the verge of a move to Roma. Speaking to the Ukrainian media, Stenstenko claimed the two clubs have agreed a deal in principle and it only remains for the Serie A side to discuss personal terms with the player. The news will come as a blow to Tottenham, who have been tracking the 25-year-old since last summer. With his contract running down and no new deal in sight, Manchester United's Dutch forward Robin van Persie admitted he faces an uncertain future at the club. Here, Sportsmail takes a look at the options available to him. Midfielder Marcelo Brozovic has joined Inter Milan from Croatian champions Dinamo Zagreb on a two-year loan deal with the option of making the move permanent. Harry Redknapp will only listen to permanent offers for Junior Hoilett and Matt Phillips - who are interesting Derby. Steve McClaren worked with both during his spell as a coach at QPR and wanted a loan deal for either. Hull and West Brom have also asked about the pair. Atletico Madrid midfielder Koke has dismissed reports linking him with a move away from the club, insisting he 'sees life in red and white'. The news will come as a blow to the likes of Manchester United and Manchester City, who are both admirers of the Spain international. The 23-year-old played a key role in the heart of Diego Simeone's side as Atletico broke the Real Madrid-Barcelona duopoly last season to claim a surprise La Liga title. There have been lots of mouth-watering rumours this month, so here at Sportsmail we have kindly rounded up for you guys the 10 transfers all fans want to see the most this month. AC Milan's search for a striker is dominating the front pages of the Italian papers this morning, with Roma's Mattia Destro top of Filippo Inzaghi's wanted list. The 23-year-old has been linked with Tottenham and Arsenal and looks set to be the subject of a transfer tussle between some of Europe's top clubs. Lucas has been linked with a move away from Anfield for some time now and the midfielder says he has considered it. He said: ‘I would be lying if I said I never thought about something new but I can’t tell you what is going to happen. I just focus on the day and leave the future to take care of itself.’Interestingly, what Lucas fails to say is that he now wants to stay at Anfield. So, will he be off in the near future? Paul Pogba is one of the most in-demand players in the world with United, Chelsea and Real Madrid all looking at the 21-year-old. Andrea Pirlo, however, believes that Louis van Gaal's side are wasting their time trying to re-sign the midfielder they let leave Old Trafford in 2012. He said: ‘For whatever reasons they chose not to give him a chance - and that is a mistake they will have to live with now. I can’t see that he (Pogba) will ever return to Manchester United.’ Callum McManaman is set to undergo his medical at West Bromwich Albion today after the club agreed a £4.75million fee with Wigan. Personal terms have been finalised with the 23-year-old winger, who could be confirmed as Tony Pulis’s first signing in the next 24 hours. Pulis is determined to add considerably to his squad this window with a new left-back and striker prime targets. Ideally he would like another winger and central midfielder too. Morning everyone .

"NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell today apologized for his handling of the Ray Rice scandal - but refused to step down from his position. As Goodell broke his nine-day silence in front of the media in New York, he admitted poor decision-making and took the blame for mistakes in his handling of the recent domestic abuse cases involving players, but stopped short of offering his resignation. 'Unfortunately over the past several weeks we have seen all too much of the NFL doing wrong and that starts with me,' he said. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell apologized at today's tense press conference, but refused to resign . As Goodell broke his nine-day silence in front of the media in New York, he admitted poor decision-making and took the blame for mistakes in his handling of the recent domestic abuse cases involving player . However he stopped short of resigning, and admitted he had never thought about stepping down . 'I got it wrong with the handling of the Ray Rice matter and I am sorry for that. I got it wrong on a number of levels from the process that I led to the decision that I reached. I don't expect anyone just to take my word,' Goodell admitted. 'I believe in accountability I understand the challenges before me and I will be held accountable for meeting them.' Critics have been calling for Goodell's resignation and when questioned if he had considered leaving his role in which he earned  $44.2 million last year, he replied: 'I have not. I have focused on doing my job to the best of my ability. 'We have a lot of work to do. I acknowledged my mistake on August 28. We are making changes.' When asked if he had considered resigning from his role, he answered: 'I have not. I have focused on doing my job to the best of my ability' When asked about his knowledge concerning Ray Rice attacking his then-fiancee Janay in an Atlantic City, New Jersey, elevator he said: 'We got new information from the first time we meet to the initial discipline . He said one of the changes is the formation of a personal conduct committee which he hoped to have new policies in place before February's Super Bowl - he did not say if he would be part of the decision-making process. When Goodell was asked about the league's investigation of Rice's elevator attack  he replied he would rely on the findings of an independent investigation by Robert Mueller, the former head of the FBI. He added that he has formed a partnership with two anti-domestic violence organizations. The news conference came a day after Goodell sent out a memo to teams, saying the NFL has initiated a 'long-term commitment to help people affected by domestic violence and sexual assault.' Arizona Cardinals running back Jonathan Dwyer (left, and in his mugshot, right) is accused of beating up his wife, Kayla (left) for refusing to have sex with him and throwing a shoe at their young son (pictured) He said that his office is taking 'significant steps' to educate teams on the issue through a series of programs. Goodell and some NFL teams have been heavily criticized for lenient or delayed punishment of Ray Rice, Adrian Peterson and other players involved in recent domestic violence cases. Less than three weeks into the season, five such cases have made headlines. He wrote in the memo: 'We are also proceeding to implement broad educational programs within our league. 'Starting within the next 30 days, all league and team personnel -- including executives, coaches, players and staff -- will participate in education sessions on domestic violence and sexual assault. 'These initial sessions will begin to provide the men and women of the NFL with information and tools to understand and recognize domestic violence and sexual assault. 'We will work with the NFL Players Association to develop and present this training in the most effective way. ' The NFL is also partnering with a domestic violence hotline and a sexual violence resource center. The league will provide financial, operational and promotional support to the National Domestic Violence Hotline and the National Sexual Violence Resource Center. Goodell said this will 'enable both the hotline and NSVRC to help more people affected by domestic violence and sexual assault.' Chris Rainey was cut from the Cardinals after being accused of slapping his girlfriend . Yesterday the White House slammed the NFL over its recent spate of child and domestic abuse scandals, calling the revelations 'deeply troubling'. An official said in D.C. on Thursday that the football league must 'get a handle' on its widespread issues of violence and have a message of 'zero tolerance'. During a briefing on an awareness campaign about sexual assaults on college campuses, an official said the NFL had an 'obligation' to the U.S. and its millions of young fans to properly discipline those involved in abuse. The White House official criticized the NFL during a briefing about the 'It's On Us' campaign, an initiative to fundamentally shift thinking about sexual assault and how to prevent it. President Obama was shocked by the video showing Rice knocking out his then-fiancée, his chief of staff said earlier this month. 'The president was shocked by what he saw, let's put it that way,' Denis McDonough said. An official later added: '...like any American, (Obama) believes that domestic violence is contemptible and unacceptable in a civilized society'. The White House's strong words came after another NFL player, Arizona Cardinals running back Jonathan Dwyer, was arrested on Wednesday. Police said he head-butted his wife and broke her nose after she refused to have sex with him, and punched her in the face the next day. The details surfaced in a police report a day after Dwyer was arrested on aggravated assault charges and deactivated from all team activities. He spent a night in jail and made a brief court appearance before being released early on Thursday. Dwyer, 25, was arrested over two incidents that occurred on July 21 and 22 at his Phoenix residence, just days before the Cardinals reported to training camp. The player denied assault but acknowledged that he punched walls in his home, threw a phone and that his wife bit his lip during the disputes, according to the police report. As he was released from jail on Thursday, he said he never hurt his son. He was ordered to wear an electronic tag and banned from contact with his wife. The Cardinals released a statement on Wednesday which said the team was 'aware of these allegations this afternoon when notified by Phoenix police and are cooperating fully. 'Given the serious nature of the allegations we have taken the immediate step to deactivate Jonathan from all team activities.' The NFL said the case will be reviewed under the league's personal-conduct policy. The Cardinals then released a second player accused of domestic violence. The team announced on Thursday that running back Chris Rainey had been released from its practice squad. Rainey was a fifth-round pick of the Steelers in 2012, but he was cut by the team after his rookie season when he was accused of slapping his girlfriend. He later pleaded no contest to disorderly conduct. Cardinals inside linebacker Daryl Washington also pleaded guilty to assaulting his ex-girlfriend and is serving a year of supervised probation. Washington has not yet been penalized by the NFL for the offense but is suspended for this season for violating the league's substance abuse policy. Minnesota Vikings star running back Adrian Peterson was indicted on felony child-abuse charges. On Wednesday, the Carolina Panthers decided that star defensive end Greg Hardy will not play any more games for the team until his domestic violence case is resolved. Hardy was convicted of assault on a female and communicating threats after the victim said the 6-foot-4, 275-pound player threw her in the bathtub and onto a sofa covered with guns before threatening to kill her. Hardy is appealing the ruling. Critics have called for NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell's resignation for his handling of Rice's case. Rice was originally suspended for two games, then banned indefinitely after the video surfaced of his brutal attack on then-fiancée Janay in an Atlantic City casino elevator. The NFL has been rocked by domestic violence issues since a videotape surfaced that showed former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice knocking out his then-fiancee Janay (both pictured at a May 23 press conference) in an Atlantic City, New Jersey, elevator . Hundreds of Baltimore fans have formed a queue stretching back half-a-mile to swap their Ray Rice jerseys for other stars' in reaction to footage that showed the NFL star punching his then-fiancée unconscious .","Commissioner Roger Goodell spoke at a press conference in New York .

"With the sun on our skin, more of our bodies exposed, lazy afternoons at the pub fuelled by gallons of Rose it's really no surprise that our libidos lift during summer. Which makes this the perfect time to talk about how to size up a potential new lover, with hardly any effort at all on your part! Here are 13 secret signs that giveaway much more than he realises and help you figure out if he's worth it... Scroll down for video . Tracey says that a man who bites his nails pushes boundaries which equates to passion meaning they make great lovers . He bites his nails . Nail-biters push themselves to the limits (hence the stress-busting biting habit) by pushing boundaries and going to extremes - which usually equates to passion. It might not look attractive but it can mean they're a great lover! He owns a dog . They're used to putting others needs first (handy in bed for you!) and used to dealing with doggy drools and moulting hair, so unlikely to be a hygiene freak (the ultimate turn-off in bed). He's no Bradley Cooper . If he's not terribly good-looking, he's not innundated with women pressing their bodies against his.So it's likely he'll spend time and effort keeping the ones that do, happy. He's got loopy handwriting . According to handwriting specialists, people who sign a lowercase 'y' with a flourish in the tail have high libidos and lots of imagination. He smells...divine . Smell is one of the indicators of attraction and the better he smells to you, the more genetically complementary the two of you may be. He's erect . As in stands up straight! Posture is indicative of laziness. If he stands with shoulders back and tummy in, he'll make an effort. Good posture also usually means the person is confident. Tracey says that even small gestures like having flexible thumbs can give away a lot about what a man is like in bed . He isn't scared to take the mickey out of himself . Anyone who can laugh at themselves out of bed, is going to be unselfconscious in it. If his humour is self-deprecating, it's a great sign he doesn't take himself too seriously and isn't ego-centred. He's bi-lingal . It's a very good sign if he speaks more than one language because it implies intelligence and effort: he's willing to work hard for rewards. A fab attribute in a long-term lover! He gets road rage . He'll be an impatient lover who's obsessed with the final destination (orgasm - his) and uninterested in the travelling (usually when you get yours). If he's a fast driver, fasten your seatbelt but go along for the ride: it usually means he's passionate and into lusty, wanton sex. Steer clear of cautious, slower-than-your-granny type drivers - even she'd want more action! He's set in his daily routine . If he hyperventilates when forced to catch the 6.05 rather than the 6.03, it's a bit of a worry sexually. He's robotic and so stinks of predictability: chances are he makes love in exactly the same way, every single time (and don't even think about moving an inch to the left or he'll wonder what's wrong). It's one thing to find something good and stick to it, but it does help if he's flexible enough to mould to your needs. He's attached at the hip - to his friends . The fact that he only moves as one means he'll be a nervous lover. He'd need lots of encouragement and approval before he'll relax because he's probably not terribly good at thinking for himself. If you're a dominant lover and don't mind playing teacher, go for it! If you know what you want, he'll fit in with you. But don't expect any surprises: he's probably got a few techniques down pat, but he's too scared to take a risk and veer into unchartered kingdoms. He's talks with his hands . If he's using big, sweeping, dramatic movements, it probably translates well into the bedroom. It usually means he's imaginative and creative and will want sex to be a 'production'. He's got flexible thumbs . See if he measures up to the ultimate sex flex by pulling his thumb: the ancient Chinese believed the more flexible it is, the more adventurous the lover. If you can hardly pull his thumb away from the main body of the palm, he's a straight, conservative lover. The further it flexes, the more bent he becomes. Take a good look at it while you're there: a large or long and heavy thumb means he's got vast amounts of sexual energy and likes to take control. Short thumbs aren't fab (weak-willed) but thumbs set very low on his hand are - this guy's sexually unconventional and highly adventurous.

"The NFL says its investigation into whether the New England Patriots used under-inflated footballs in the AFC championship game is ongoing after a report Tuesday night claimed the league found 11 balls were not properly inflated. Troy Vincent, the NFL's executive vice president for football operations, told The Associated Press that the 'investigation is currently underway and we're still awaiting findings.' Vincent was responding to an ESPN report that cited anonymous league sources saying 11 of the Patriots' 12 allotted game footballs were under-inflated by 2 pounds. Scroll down for videos . Big moment: Indianapolis Colts linebacker D'Qwell Jackson's interception against the New England Patriots (pictured) reportedly caused the Colts to first look into what is being called 'Deflategate' Official probe: A referee checks a ball during the AFC Championship game on Sunday night . Patriots spokesman Stacey James told ESPN: 'We have been in complete cooperation with the league and will continue to do so.' Vincent said earlier Tuesday he expected the probe to be concluded by the end of the week. The last thing the NFL wants after a difficult season off the field is a potential cheating scandal that disrupts Super Bowl week. New England faces the Seattle Seahawks on February 1 in Glendale, Arizona. In 2007, a New England Patriots assistant was caught filming New York Jets coaches as they gave signals on defensive plays. The revelation resulted in a massive NFL investigation that found the Patriots guilty of cheating. The scandal was dubbed 'Spygate.' Head coach Bill Belichick admitted to taping opposing coaches' signals dating back to 2000 - his entire tenure with the Patriots. He claimed that he believed the practice was allowed within the rules of the NFL, as long as the tape was reviewed after the game. The NFL levied a $500,000 fine against Belichick, the heftiest in the league's history. The team was also fined $250,000 and stripped of their first-round pick in the 2008 draft. The Patriots, who beat Indianapolis 45-7 for the AFC title, said they were cooperating with the league, and a Seahawks spokesman said the team would defer to the league on the matter . The NFL began looking into the issue not only because doctoring the footballs could provide a competitive advantage, but because it would compromise the integrity of the game. Deflating a football can change the way it's gripped by a player or the way it travels through the air. Under NFL rules, each team provides balls each game for use when its offense is on the field. The balls are inspected before the game by the officiating crew, then handled during the game by personnel provided by the home team. The Colts reached out to the NFL after a team staff member had concerns regarding a football intercepted by Colts player D'Qqwell Jackson, according to Newsday. The Patriots have been brushing off and even finding humor in questions about whether they used under-inflated footballs in the game that put them in the Super Bowl. Referee Walt Anderson was spotted replacing a ball at the start of the third quarter, returning it to the sidelines, although it was not confirmed whether this was linked to the inflation issue. The investigation has been referred to as 'Deflategate' online and by numerous news outlets. Jackson's interception took place in the second quarter and the Colts first noticed something unusual afterward, Newsday reported. The news outlet referred to an individual familiar with background. A Colts equipment staff member was handed the ball by Jackson and noticed that it seemed under-inflated, Newsday reported. Colts coach Chuck Pagano was informed by the staff member, according to the report. Ryan Grigson, the Colts general manager, was alerted before he reached out to NFL director of football operations Mike Kensil, who in turn spoke to on-field officials during the AFC championship game's halftime, according to the Newsday report. Social media responses were quick late Tuesday night and into Wednesday morning. '11 of 12 balls under-inflated can anyone spell cheating!!! (hash)Just Saying' was the tweet from Hall of Fame receiver Jerry Rice. Caught: Referee Walt Anderson reaches down for a ball at the start of the third quarter . Benched: He replaces it with another ball before returning the initial ball to the sidelines . Win: New England Patriots Coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady are seen embracing after winning on Sunday against the Colts. The Patriots are now going into the Super Bowl against the Seattle Seahawks . 'So we get to play the game again or nah? ??' tweeted Colts cornerback Darius Butler. Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers said on ESPN radio in Milwaukee that he didn't like how referees who inspected balls before games take air out of the game balls. 'I have a major problem with the way it goes down, to be honest with you,' Rodgers said. 'The majority of the time, they take air out of the football. I think that, for me, is a disadvantage.' Rodgers said referees have a set range in which they 'like to set game balls,' and that he always liked the higher end of the range because of his grip. 'I just have a hard time throwing a flat football,' Rodgers said. He thought a slight majority of quarterbacks like footballs on the flatter side. 'My belief is that there should be a minimum air-pressure requirement but not a maximum,' Rodgers said. 'There's no advantage, in my opinion. We're not kicking the football. There's no advantage in having a pumped-up football.' Patriots quarterback Tom Brady told WEEI, 'I think I’ve heard it all at this point. That’s the least of my worries. I don’t even respond to stuff like this.' Inquiry: Belichick has said he wasn't aware there was an issue until Monday morning and promised to 'cooperate fully with whatever the league wants us to, whatever questions they ask' Explanation? New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowksi tweeted this photo of himself spiking the ball with the words: 'WARNING GRONKING MAY CAUSE DEFLATION' Flat: Balls for the Superbowl next month wait to be laced and pumped up at the Wilson Sporting Goods Co. in Ada, Ohio . And tight end Rob Gronkowski tweeted a photo of himself spiking the ball with the words: 'WARNING GRONKING MAY CAUSE DEFLATION.' Belichick on Tuesday deferred questions about the investigation, saying reporters should ask league officials. NFL officials declined comment except to say the investigation was still pending. Belichick earlier said he wasn't aware there was an issue until Monday morning and promised to 'cooperate fully with whatever the league wants us to, whatever questions they ask.' Belichick, of course, was fined $500,000 in 2007 for having an assistant spy on the New York Jets' defensive signals. The NFL's investigation was first reported by WTHR. Special teams captain Matthew Slater said the Patriots 'try to do things the right way. We work hard at our jobs, our professions, to be successful and it's unfortunate that things like this come up, but that's life, that's the world we live in.' Colts coach Chuck Pagano said he did not notice issues with the football and didn't specify when asked whether the Colts had reported the issue to officials. 'We talk just like they talk to officials (before the game),' he said. 'We have an opportunity to talk to the officials about a lot of things.' Patriots wide receiver Julian Edelman said the balls didn't feel different than usual. And defensive tackle Vince Wilfork seemed amused by the matter and didn't shed any light on it. 'I don't know anything about that,' he said. ""I don't touch footballs. I tackle people.'","The NFL has said it is reviewing whether the New England Patriots manipulated footballs during their 45-7 home win over the Indianapolis Colts in the AFC championship game Sunday night .

"Librarians at the University of Leeds have dusted off what is thought to be the one of first portable and travel sized library of books. Long before books were stored on a Kindle, smartphone or tablet, the Jacobean miniature travelling library was the only way literature fans could carry a large number of books. The miniature library was contained in a wooden case, bound in brown turkey leather, disguising it as a large folio volume, containing three shelves of gold-tooled vellum-bound books. Now it may not be backlit or be able to use Wi-Fi, but back in 17th century England only four families were lucky enough to have one. Tthe 1617 'Jacobean Kindle' - which takes the unassuming appearance of a large folio volume when closed, opens up to reveal its three shelves of 50 gold-tooled vellum-bound books . Stella Butler, University Librarian and Keeper of the Brotherton Collection, said: 'The Jacobean travelling library - one of only four made - dates from 1617 and is one of the most curious items in the Brotherton Collection. The miniature books are contained in a wooden case disguised to look like a large book. It's essentially a 17th century e-book reader such as a Kindle.' The books within are all small in format and bound in limp vellum covers with coloured fabric ties. They are gold-tooled on the spine with a flower and a wreath, and all the covers have a gilt angel bearing a scroll that reads Gloria Deo. A close-up of the interior of the 'folio' showing the 50 miniature books. Only four families were lucky enough to own such a library, thus allowing them to carry their precious books with them . The rare miniature travelling library dating from 1617 forms part of Leeds University's huge Brotherton Collection of rare manuscripts, photographs and books set to go public show thanks to a £1.3m Heritage Lottery grant . University Librarian and Keeper of the Brotherton Collection Stella Butler examines one of the books in the travelling library, a rare treat for just four families . The catalogue inside the front cover is arranged in three columns of text within an architectural structure of arches and columns painted on a sheet of vellum. The miniature books are a collection of about 40 mainly classical texts divided into three sections: theology and philosophy, history, poetry. They include works by Cicero, Virgil, Ovid, Seneca, Horace and Julius Caesar. The library was reportedly commissioned by William Hakewill MP (1574-1655) for a friend at the turn of the year 1617/1618. Within a period of five years he ordered three other such libraries to be made for his friends or patrons. The index to the books in the collection: It contains works on theology and philosophy, history and poetry - enough to cover the most demanding 17th Century appetite . It looks just like an ordinary book albeit one that has seen a fair share of wear and tear. It is only when the 'folio' is opened hat its treasures are revealed -  three shelves of 50 gold-tooled vellum-bound books . These are now held at the British Library, the Huntington Library California, and the Toledo Museum of Art Ohio. The recipient of the University of Leeds copy seems to have been a member of the Irish Madden family, whose arms are clearly painted beneath the catalogue of the library inside the front board. Rare manuscripts and books, like the Jacobean miniature travelling library, will soon be going on show to the public thanks to a round of Heritage Lottery Fund grants announced last Wednesday.

The books are still in remarkable condition despite their great age. The library dates back to 1617 - just 14 years after the death of Queen Elizabeth I . The University of Leeds boasts one of the finest collections of rare books and manuscripts in the world in its Special Collections, housed in the Brotherton Library. The breadth of subjects at the library is considered exceptional, from exquisite photographs of pre-revolutionary Russia to books dating from the beginning of printing, as well as the archives of some of the 20th century's most influential poets and writers, and much more. Now a grant of £1,385,800 has provided the final piece of the jigsaw for a £1.9 million project for a gallery, where treasures from the Brotherton: Inspiring Audiences and Engaging Communities will go on display. Work is expected to start on the new galleries, to be housed in the University's iconic Parkinson Building in Woodhouse Lane, next spring, with a provisional opening date of November 2015.

"Mario Balotelli stole the headlines against Besiktas on Thursday when he fought off team-mates Jordan Henderson and Daniel Sturridge to take the winning penalty. With the scores level after 84 minutes, Jordon Ibe was fouled in the box and despite protestations from both Henderson and Sturridge, Balotelli took the ball and scored from the spot. Speaking on ITV, Gerrard said: 'Basically Jordan (Henderson) should’ve taken it. Mario Balotelli and Samuel Eto'o fight over who should take a penalty for Inter Milan against Palermo . Then-Inter captain Javier Zanetti steps in to drag a sulking Balotelli out of the way . Eto'o then stares at Balotelli for some time before eventually taking the spot-kick . 'I think Mario’s been a bit mischievous by stepping in front of him and going against what the manager has planned before the game.' But for those who watched the Italian forward during his days at Inter Milan, this wasn't a surprising move. Balotelli attempted a similar tactic with Samuel Eto'o in a game against Palermo in 2009. When a penalty was awarded, a teenage Balotelli tried to take the ball off of Eto'o, who was Inter's established penalty taker at the time. Unfortunately for the enigmatic forward, his status in that squad didn't carry as much clout and he lost out to the Cameroonian, having to be dragged away by Javier Zanetti. Needless to say, Balotelli did not join in the celebrations after Eto'o scored. Henderson, though, proved himself to be the bigger man and praised his team-mate after the game. He said: 'I wanted the penalty but Mario felt confident. He’s taken big penalties before and it was great penalty in the end and a big goal for us.

"Jose Mourinho admitted his Chelsea side were lucky to get a draw against Paris Saint-Germain after goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois was forced to make a string of impressive saves. The visitors took the lead through Branislav Ivanovic but Edinson Cavani equalised soon after and both he and Zlatan Ibrahimovic came close to providing the Ligue 1 champions with a winning goal. Their efforts, though, were thwarted by Courtois, who more than made up for the frailty of the defence in front of him. Jose Mourinho admitted his Chelsea side were lucky to get a draw against Paris Saint-Germain . Thibaut Courtois made a number of impressive saves to deny PSG a winning goal in Paris . 'We could (have lost) so the result is a positive one,' Mourinho told ITV. 'I don't say very good because it depends on the result of the second leg but I say positive result against a very good team, a team with fantastic attacking payers. It was a difficult match. 'When you see the performance of our goalkeeper you have to say yes (we were lucky to get a draw) because our goalkeeper made two or three important saves in the game.' Mourinho's side began the Champions League tie strongly but faded in the second half, a factor the Portuguese manager attributed to fitness issues in the squad. He said: 'I had in this team five players that didn't train. Five players since the game against Everton they didn't train once. Yesterday they had a warming down and also for the press to see that they were on the pitch. 'We felt that a little.  I'm happy with the result. Two legs is now one leg with everything to be decided at Stamford Bridge.' The Belgian stopper, preferred to Petr Cech, tips Edinson Cavani's header wide in the first half . Branislav Ivanovic rises highest to head home the opener, giving Chelsea a precious away goal . The impressive Cavani equalised shortly after the break, heading home Blaise Matuidi's cross . The result means the west Londoners are well placed to progress - certainly better, in John Terry's view, than when they advanced to the semi-finals at PSG's expense last term on away goals after losing 3-1 at the Parc des Princes. 'I think both teams were kind of feeling each other out in the first half,' said the Chelsea captain. 'It was quite an even game and we managed to go one-up. 'But it was a difficult second half. Thibaut pulled off some great saves to keep us in it, but we got away with a happy draw. 'I think the key was last year I think we made it very difficult for ourselves going back to the Bridge - we're in a lot better position now. 'Listen, they're a very good side, especially going forwards. It is going to be very tough but we're in a better position than we were last year.' Courtois was particularly impressive for Chelsea, making a string of fine saves after coming in for Petr Cech. 'He was different class,' Terry added. 'When you look at Petr in the week, he made two great saves from (Everton's Romelu) Lukaku to win us three points. 'Thibaut came back in today. The competition is great and it is fierce amongst the squad. That's what is needed. We are all playing a team game.'

"Bayern Munich  defender Dante has complained about the lack of respect shown to him since Brazil were beaten 7-1 by Germany at the World Cup. The 31-year-old was drafted into the national side for the match to cover for Brazil's suspended captain Thiago Silva. While he was not singled out at the time for being especially at fault for the result, Dante feels German supporters no longer show him the respect he deserves. Dante and Brazil team-mate Julio Cesar look dejected during the 7-1 defeat by Germany at the World Cup . Dante feels his reputation back in Germany has suffered as a result of the humiliating defeat . 'What is happening is unfair,' he told Bild. 'Since the World Cup semi-final against Germany people give me less respect. 'No-one thinks about whether it could break my career or the pressure it has put on me.' Dante has won back-to-back Bundesliga titles since joining Bayern from Borussia Monchengladbach in 2012. He also played a key role in winning two German Cups, the Champions League, European Super Cup and Club World Cup. Despite this, fans are quick to point out flaws in his game and the Brazilian believes this is a result of his country's disappointing performance at the World Cup. He said: 'I am sure that if I had come back as a world champion, people would judge me very differently - even if I was playing exactly the same as I am now.'

"An Oregon man who turned a Boeing 727 . into his home has now set his sights on an even bigger model in the . hopes of building a second home in Japan out of a retired 747. Bruce Campbell made the 727 his home in the suburbs of Portland and spends six months of the year there. Complete with wings, and landing gear resting on pillars, it is where Campbell spends six months of the year. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Retired: The retired Boeing 727-200 commercial airliner now has a new life as a home in Hillsboro, Oregon . Engine room: Bruce Campbell, pictured, relaxes up high inside the middle engine of his 3-engined Boeing 727-200 airliner . Dream home: Engineer Bruce Campbell, pictured, transformed an old 727 200 aircraft, situated in the woods of Oregon, into his 'dream home' In 1999, the former electrical engineer had a vision: To save retired jetliners from becoming scrap metal by reusing them. Slightly built and with a charming smile, the 64-year-old Campbell sees the task as part of his goal in life. 'Mine . is to change humanity's behavior in this little niche,' he said as he . stood beside the plane, lamenting the need to power wash its exterior . and trim the dense foliage. Campbell . is one of a small number of people worldwide - from Texas to the . Netherlands - who have transformed retired aircraft into a living space . or other creative project, although a spokesman for the Aircraft Fleet . Recycling Association was unable to say precisely how many planes are . re-used this way. AFRA, an . organization made up of industry leaders including Boeing that focus on . sustainable end-of-service practices for airframes and engines, . estimates that 1,200 to 1,800 aircraft will be dismantled globally over . the next three years, and 500 to 600 will be retired annually over the . next two decades. 'AFRA is happy to see aircraft fuselages re-purposed in a range of creative ways,' said AFRA spokesman Martin Todd.

Lawnmower: Bruce Campbell, pictured, mows his lawn and picks up weeds beneath the retired Boeing 727-200 commercial jet in Hillsboro, Oregon . 'We would want them to be recovered and be re-used in an environmentally sustainable fashion.' Campbell . was in his early 20s when he paid around $23,000 for the 10 acres on . which his plane rests. His original plan was to make a home from freight . vans, but then he decided a plane would be better. A van still sits . nearby, covered in growth. He purchased the 727 after hearing about a Mississippi hairdresser who had done it. Now, . about $220,000, many years of work and several hard-learned lessons . later, Campbell is ready to do it all over again, this time with a . Boeing 747 he hopes to buy and move to Japan, where he also spends half . of the year.

'It . makes perfect sense that they use those airplanes for something,' she . said. 'It's a fascinating concept. I think it could take traction if . people were more environmental.'

Campbell has created a website with details on rebuilding planes, he's . not the only one with such a vision as aircrafts have been made into . homes in Texas, Costa Rica and the Netherlands.

"Amid all the fashion models and concept cars at the Paris motor show, Kia's new, third-generation Sorrento sports utility vehicle, brought a refreshing sense of reality. Designed for families on the move who need space, the seven-seater promises improved ride, handling and crash safety and a higher quality interior and design. Kia says it features a higher level of sophistication than the present model. The Korean company's European design team, based in Frankfurt, is behind the move upmarket. A spokesman says: 'A higher proportion of soft-touch materials and leather creates a modern luxury feel to the cabin and premium vehicle ambience.' Buyers will be offered a menu of safety technologies, including a lane departure warning system, which audibly alerts drivers who stray from the chosen lane without using indicators. Amid all the fashion models and concept cars at the Paris motor show, Kia's new, third-generation Sorrento sports utility vehicle stood out . A blind-spot detection system flashes a warning in the door mirror when another car is in the driver's blind spot, and rear cross-traffic alert warns against other cars driving behind the vehicle in a car park. There's also a feature once found only in limos — the speed limit is displayed on the dashboard console, constantly relayed from onboard cameras that read roadside signs. Its second row of seats can split several ways and can slide away to allow easier access to the third. All passengers are promised more legroom and greater baggage space. There's also a 'smart' power tailgate. A spokesman says: 'This system opens the tailgate automatically when the key is sensed close to the boot, so owners can put shopping bags or heavy objects straight into the vehicle.' A new soundproofing material for the transmission tunnel and a 29 per cent thicker panel combine to help cut cabin noise by 3 to 6 per cent, depending on the driving conditions. Three engines are available, including a 2.4-litre petrol direct injection (GDI) and two turbodiesel engines — two-litre and 2.2-litre. However, UK models on sale next spring from around £40,000 will be available only with the 2.2 CRDi engine. The UK version has also been designed to give a softer ride over bumps to reduce the stress and possible discomfort on long journeys. Kia is on a bit of a roll, enjoying its best ever September UK sales. It delivered 13,292 new cars, taking the total so far this year to 62,538 — more than 7 per cent up on 2013. It aims to surpass its 2014 target of 78,000. Its biggest seller, the Sportage, had almost 3,500 buyers, followed by the Picanto, Cee'd, Rio and Venga. More than half of customers (56 per cent) are private buyers. If you fancy a trip across the Channel, the Paris show runs until October 19. You'll need more than a day to see everything. Tickets start at €14 (£11). Go to: mondial-automobile.com. The Countess of Wessex revealed she drives an F-Type Jaguar when she met its designer, Jaguar design boss Ian Callum, at a reception for the London Press Club Ball. Even the roar of the engine appeals to her, she confided. Jaguar Land Rover was the main automotive sponsor of the Ball, held this week at the Royal Courts of Justice, to raise funds for the Journalists' Charity. One racy lady royal, clearly. The wraps came off the new high-tech Mondeo in Paris. It marks the debut of Ford's new technology which can detect people in the road ahead — or who could cross the vehicle's path — and applies the brakes automatically if the driver does not respond to warnings. The pre-collision assist with pedestrian detection also aims to help reduce road deaths and serious injuries. The new versions have the widest range of engines and gearboxes Ford has ever offered. Fuel-efficient auto start-stop technology is standard throughout the range. The new Mondeo also introduces intelligent all-wheel drive to the range's line-up. The new Hyundai hatchback i20 which the company describes as a 'truly European car' A new hatchback from Hyundai turned a few heads in Paris. The Korean firm said the new-generation i20, has evolved into 'a more premium-quality package'. It's been designed, developed and built in Europe, and was billed as a 'truly European car' on its world premiere at the show. It will feature a frugal one-litre turbocharged three-cylinder petrol engine in 2015. Allan Rushforth, senior vice-president and chief operating officer at Hyundai Europe, says: 'The i20 is a truly European car. 'Our one-litre engine follows the trend of small turbocharged engines, which provide great driving performance while being very efficient. It underlines Hyundai's commitment to sustainable mobility and gives an insight into our future innovations.' AUDI unveiled a five-door prototype of its popular TT coupe. The TT Sportback, powered by a 395bhp two-litre engine. Hands-free and driverless at nearly 150mph... are you mad? Well, Audi thinks it's not. A driverless Audi RS7 Sportback is to tackle Germany's Hockenheim circuit at race speed next week to showcase the potential for self-driving car technology.","The seven-seater promises improved ride, handling and crash safety .

"Follow Sportsmail's coverage of the Europa League round of 32 as Tottenham Hotspur host Fiorentina at White Hart Lane and Celtic host Inter Milan at Celtic Park on Thursday night. Both know a place in the Champions League is up for grabs for the winner of the competition and will look to steal a spot among Europe's elite next year. So, can Tottenham and Celtic see off their Italian opposition? Both kick-off at 8.05pm. Host commentator . That's all for tonight, thanks for joining. Who says the Europa League is boring? What a game. Celtic pushed relentlessly in the second half and thoroughly deserve their draw. Two substitutes combine with Henderson heading the ball onto Guidetti in the box, who controls it on his chest before firing into the roof of the net. A disappointing result in the end for Spurs who should have been out of sight after the first half. There will be three added minutes in London and four in Glasgow. Having been so dominant in the first half, get a distinct impression that Tottenham will settle for the draw here. No great ambition left. Fiorentina have been poor on the whole tonight but one man out there has rolled back the years tonight - Joaquin. This is the best I've seen him play in years and has been a constant threat on the counter attack. Gomez walks slowly off the pitch to be replaced by Ilicic. The unimpressive Paulinho is replaced by Mason. Ambrose comes on for Matthews, who appears to be injured. Griffiths' miss when through on goal. It's hard to see the hosts getting a better chance to equalise. Unless he's exhausted it's hard to see the logic in bringing off Townsend. By wide consensus he's been Spurs's best player. Mancini makes a change as Kuzmanovic is replaced by Dodo. Valero is replaced by Badelj as Fiorentina look to secure the result. Scorer of Celtic's first goal Armstrong is replaced by Henderson while Guidetti comes on for Grifiths. Birthday boy Icardi is replaced by Kovacic. Club-record signing Lamela replaces Townsend - the English winger started really well but has drifted out of the game slightly. The view from the stands at Celtic Park. The German has had little-to-no service all game but he counters well, finding space in the box before lifting his shot just over the bar. His best chance of the match so far (not that that's saying much...) And Griffiths really should have scored. The former Wolves striker misses a glorious chance when through on goal. Good save by Carrizo, though. Chadli is replaced by Kane. Fiorentina captain Pasqual is replaced by former Bolton man Alonso. Tottenham's leading scorer is getting ready to come on... Had doubts over whether Tottenham could maintain their early pace and that is proving the case. They have slowed up dramatically in the past 10 minutes. Mackay-Steven with a decent chance for Celtic. The former Dundee man gets away from Inter's defence but his run pushes him wide and his shot is saved well by Carrizo. Mancini and Deila watching their teams during the second half . Gordon's got a long way to go to make up for his howler but he's trying. Shaqiri dances into the box and bends one towards the top corner but Celtic's keeper palms it away at full stretch. The longer this game continues with the scores level the more Mauricio Poichettino will have to think about bringing Kane off the bench - a 1-1 draw would not be a satisfactory result for Spurs, especially considering their domination in this game. Both teams back out and play is underway in Glasgow. ...and we're back under way at White Hart Lane. At half-time we are listening to Ledley and the Kings, who have produced Tottenham's official Capital One Cup final song. It is a re-working of Chas & Dave's Hot Shot Tottenham. Of course. Half time at Celtic Park and Inter lead 3-2. Fans, and Gordon, may feel it's a harsh scoreline but every mistake is punished at this level and Celtic know that. Half time in north London but Chadli really should have restored their lead before the break. Soldado's header is saved and the ball falls for the Belgian to tap into an empty net... but he somehow conspires to hit the bar. Calamitous football from Gordon!  A long ball is played into the Celtic box but the goalkeeper fumbles what should be a routine catch and Palacio pounces to restore Inter's lead. Even when he scores, it's never quite straightforward for Soldado. Daft free-kick to concede. The free-kick is whipped in after Soldado's foul. Lloris palms it away but Basanta is on hand to bury the rebound from close range. Soldado is beaten by compatriot Jopaquin but as the winger heads towards the box the Tottenham striker brings him down. Harry Kane on the bench but getting plenty of love from the crowd. 'Harry, give us a wave' followed by said wave has got the biggest since the goal. Other chants have included: 'Chelsea racists, we are coming for you.' At 2-0 down Celtic looked in danger of being humiliated at Parkhead but in just over 60 seconds they have come roaring back into this tie. Salah looking very ordinary here. Armstrong involved again, a speculative cross comes into the box Celtic's previous goalscorer pressures Campagnaro, who puts it into his own net from five yards out. Armstrong grabs a vital goal after a nice move for Celtic and Ronny Deila's side are back in this. Argentine forward Palacio doubling Inter's lead in the first half. Soldado gives Tottenham the lead with a superbly-taken volley. Sahqiri, on loan from Bayern Munich, celebrates gibing Inter the lead in the fourth minute. Salah misses a glorious chance to equalise. The ball bobbles through to him as he makes his way into the box but takes an age to shoot and is closed down well. Oh dear. Palacio makes it 2-0 to the visitors. Deila's side struggled to clear the ball and the Argentine strikes from close range with his shot slipping under Gordon. Fiorentina are firmly on the back foot against Tottenham, they look rattled by that early goal and can't string two passes together. Inter, on the other hand, look as confident as they have all season. Celtic need to wake up. Rodriguez with the first booking of the night in north London. That didn't take long. Tottenham have been dominant. Chadli wasted a great chance moments earlier but what a lovely finish from Soldado for 1-0. Gets maligned quite fairly for his finishing but that was impressive. Roberto Soldado grabs his fifth goal of the season and what a goal it is. Spurs swing in a corner and the former Valencia man drifts away from his marker and volleys home. Inter lead! Shaqiri takes a pass over his shoulder and volleys beautifully. It's saved initially bit the loan player is quick to react and tucks away the rebound. Mackay-Steven wastes no time in proving he's up for the occasion. Celtic press high up and the January signing takes a shot from just outside the box. The keeper saves low just to his left. Referees in London and Glasgow blow their whistles to start the games! Celtic legend Bertie Auld was on the pitch before kick-off giving them an emotional speech - I think it's fair to say the passion is still there for him... Check out Sportsmail's pre-match stats and facts video . Not long to go until kick-off now, the players have finished their warm up and are back in their dressing rooms. Richards impressed in his last outing for Fiorentina - a 3-1 win over Sassuolo - but again fails to make the starting lineup. The full back is now almost certain to return to the Premier League in the summer, although former City boss Mancini has expressed an interest in bringing him to Inter. Despite a hero's welcome at Inter, it hasn't been easy for Mancini in Italy this season. His side are currently 10th in Serie A and have lost three of their last five matches. One positive note for them, though, is that they won their previous two matches, scoring seven goals and conceding just one in the process. After just one goal in his first 16 games for the Viola this season, Mario Gomez has now netted five in his last four appearances. He's still a long way off his Bayern Munich form, but the German forward will be a huge test for Fazio and Vertonghen. The Serie A side may be without Juan Cuadrado but Mohamed Salah, on loan from Chelsea, does get the nod. XI: Tatarusanu, Rodriguez, Savic, Pizarro, Mati Fernandez, Joaquin, Basanta, B. Valero, Pasqual, Gomez, Salah. Subs: Alonso, Aquilani, Babacar, Badelj, Ilicic, Neto (GK), Richards. After a difficult start to life at Celtic, manager Ronny Deila is finding his stride. Tonight, though, is surely his largest test - and it will be played out in front of his largest crowd. The full 60,000 capacity is expected to be filled for the match against Roberto Mancini's side. Lukas Podolski left Arsenal in search of game time but after failing to score a single goal for Inter he doesn't make the squad for the match tonight at Celtic Park. XI: Carrizo; Campagnaro, Ranocchia, Juan Jesus, Santon; Medel, Guarin, Kuzmanovic; Shaqiri; Palacio, Icardi. Subs: Handanovic, Kovacic, Vidic, Obi, Dodo, Puscas, Hernanes. There's no place for on-loan Manchester City striker John Guidetti in Ronny Deila's lineup, Leigh Griffiths is preferred again. XI: Gordon; Matthews, Denayer, van Dijk, Izaguirre; Brown, Bitton; Mackay-Steven, Johansen, Armstrong; Griffiths. Subs: Subs: Zaluska, Ambrose, Henderson, McGregor, Wakaso, Scepovic, Guidetti. And the big news is that star striker Harry Kane (23 goals this season) is rested, leaving Roberto Soldado (four goals this season) to lead the line. XI: Lloris (c), Walker, Fazio, Vertonghen, Davies; Bentaleb, Paulinho; Chadli, Eriksen, Townsend; Soldado. Subs: Vorm, Dier, Rose, Dembele, Lamela, Mason, Kane.

"If you’re the type of person who drives around looking for a space big enough for your not-quite parallel parking skills, then help may be at hand. A robot named ‘Ray’ has been developed to help spatially-challenged drivers fit into tight spaces by automatically parking their car for them. The technology, currently being used at Düsseldorf International Airport, claims to be able to park 60 per cent more vehicles in one area compared to a human driver. Scroll down for video . And it’s simple to use. A driver leaves their car at a Vehicle Transfer Station (VTS), which uses laser scanners to measure the precise height and width of the vehicle. The system then calculates the position of the vehicle’s wheels and measures other key parts such as the wing mirrors and the bumper. Once this is done, the driver is issued with a ticket from a terminal where they can leave their vehicle in Ray’s mechanical 'hands'. A robot named ‘Ray’ has been developed to help spatially-challenged drivers fit into tight spaces by automatically parking their car for them.

Approaching from the side, Ray picks up the car by sliding one set of its forks each under its front and rear wheels. The car is then transported to the parking spot selected by the system’s software. When a driver wants their car back, they pay the ticket and their vehicle will be brought to a nearby VTS. The technology has been developed by Serva transport systems, a company based in Grabenstätt Bavaria, alongside the Fraunhofer Institute for Material Flow and Logistics in Dortmund.

Software divides up the area to make sure cars make the best possible space, for example by parking cars of a similar size together. Ray can reshuffle the arrangement of cars at any time if it realised that a different arrangement would make more efficient use of the space. The system is already being used in the parking of Dusseldorf Airport alongside a smartphone app that tells drivers if their car is ready to be collected. ‘This technology is especially handy during peak times,’ Dr Christian Jahncke, managing director of SITA Airport IT told Fraunhofer magazine. ‘Instead of spending millions of euros to extend our garages, we could simply make better use of the space we already have.’ It’s happened to all of us: Faced with a busy car park, you suddenly have a sinking feeling that you have no idea where you have left your car. But instead of wandering the endless rows of identical vehicles, you can now let your smartphone track down your ride with a simple push of the button. Google recently announced that smartphones using its Google Now service will be offering something known as a ‘parking detector’ The intelligent personal assistant, available within the Google Search mobile application for the Android and iOS operating systems, lists the address of the place where you last left your car. It does this on a Google Now ‘parking card’ on your phone, that also provides a map which shows how far you are from that location. If the card gets it wrong the first time, the service will also offer alternative places that you can check.","The system is currently being used at Düsseldorf Airport in Germany .

"You have a temperature and no appetite. Your head is aching and your throat is sore. It may appear as though a common cold is lurking, but unbeknownst to you the vicious Ebola virus has started to attack your immune system. The virus destroys the same cells as those targeted by HIV, though the Ebola infection is more aggressive, wiping out the building blocks of the body's immune system. It has an incubation period - that is the time from infection to when the first symptoms present themselves - of between two and 21 days, increasing the risk of the highly-infectious illness spreading. A rising temperature, headache and sore throat are the first signs the Ebola virus is invading the body, attacking the building blocks of the immune system. As the disease progresses, victims suffer blood shot eyes, as tiny blood vessels burst, causing bleeding from the eyes, ears, mouth, and other orifices . Where a victim has breaks in the skin, blood seeps out, as the disease takes hold. The virus has a death rate of up to 90 per cent, and is highly-contagious, spreading through contact with an infected person's blood, secretions, organs and other bodily fluids . As soon as a victim starts to suffer the sudden onset of the disease, the fever, crippling headache and muscle pain, they are already contagious. The virus is transmitted through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals. Once a human is infected, the disease can spread quickly within a community, with health workers and family members of victims at particular risk. The current outbreak rampaging through West Africa, began in a small village in Guinea and since February it has claimed 672 lives, leaving another 1,200 people infected. It has spread into neighbouring Sierra Leone and Liberia. And on Friday, U.S. citizen Patrick Sawyer died in the Nigerian capital of Lagos, having travelled there by plane after attending his sister's funeral, after she too died of the disease. This is now the most prolific Ebola outbreak since the disease was first discovered in 1976. The fact the virus mimics the symptoms of a common cold in its early stages, is the very aspect that makes the disease so difficult to diagnose. Within a few days, the early symptoms give way to the next stage of the virus. Disseminated intravascular coagulation causes clots and hemorrhaging, with clots in the liver, spleen, brain and other internal organs. The virus pierces veins and capillaries, forcing the blood vessels to bleed into the surrounding tissue. A patient will suffer aches all over the body, chronic abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhoea. The current outbreak, which has so far claimed 672 lives, started in a village in Guinea, spreading to Liberia and Sierra Leone. On Friday, a U.S. citizen Patrick Sawyer became the first victim to die in Nigeria, having flown to the capital Lagos after attending his sister's funeral in Liberia, after she succumbed to the disease . The latest outbreak is the worst since the disease was first discovered in 1976 . Patrick Sawyer, 40, from the U.S. died in the Nigerian capital of Lagos on Friday. He collapsed after getting off a flight from Liberia on July 20 and was isolated at a hospital in the city . A rash then appears on the torso, quickly spreading to the limbs and head. Within a few days tipping point is reached - the moment at which some lucky patients will recover, while others will develop the fatal phase, haemorrhaging fever. The body's immune system turns on itself. Tiny blood vessels burst, causing patients to spontaneously bleed from their eyes, mouths, ears, and other orifices. Internally bleeding is likely in the gastrointestinal tract and other internal organs. The whites of a patient's eyes will turn red and blood spots appear in vomit and diarrhoea, as large blood blisters develop under the skin. For those who succumb to the disease, death is usually the result of multiple organ failure, haemorrhaging or shock and typically occurs between eight and 17 days after a person first falls ill. For those who survive, they must be regularly tested, to ensure the virus is no longer present within their bodily fluids, before it is safe to be discharged from hospital. The virus can also be sexually transmitted for up to 40 days after a man has recovered. The highly-infectious disease is spread through contact with a victim's blood, secretions, organs and other bodily fluids. Pictured are villagers in Kikwit, Zaire during an outbreak in August 1995 . Liberian health workers wearing protective clothing carry the body of a woman who died of the Ebola virus away from an isolation unit in Foya, Lofa County for burial . There is currently no vaccine to . protect against the Ebola virus. And in the absence of a specific . treatment plan or drug to tackle the disease, it poses a real risk. For those lucky enough to defy the odds and overcome the virulent disease, health problems lurk on the horizon. Ebola . survivors often develop chronic inflammatory conditions that affect the . joints and eyes, problems which they can be burdened with for the rest . of their lives. Dr Amar . Safdar, associate professor of infectious disease and immunology at NYU . Langone Medical Center, told CBS News, the complications are the result . of the body's immune response to Ebola. Survivors are at risk of developing arthralgia, a type of joint and bone pain similar to arthritis. And . those who have overcome the disease frequently complain of a condition . called uveitis, which can cause tearing, sensitivity in the eye, . inflammation and in extreme cases, blindness. What is Ebola virus disease? Ebola is a severe, often fatal illness, with a death rate of up to 90 per cent.The illness affects humans as well as primates, including monkeys, gorillas and chimpanzees. How do people become infected with the virus? Ebola is transmitted through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals. In Africa infection in humans has happened as a result of contact with chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, monkeys, forest antelope and porcupines found ill or dead in the rainforest. Once a person becomes infected, the virus can spread through contact with a sufferer's blood, urine, saliva, stools and semen. A person can also become infected if broken skin comes into contact with a victim's soiled clothing, bed linen or used needles. Men who have recovered from the disease, can still spread the virus to their partner through their semen for seven weeks after recovery. Ebola is a severe, often fatal disease, with a death rate of up to 90 per cent . Who is most at risk? Those at risk during an outbreak include: . What are the typical signs and symptoms? Sudden onset of fever, intense weakness,  muscle pain, headache and sore throat. That is followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, impaired kidney and liver function and internal and external bleeding. The incubation period is bet ween two and 21 days. A person will become contagious once they start to show symptoms. When should you seek medical care? If a person is in an area affected by the outbreak, or has been in contact with a person known or suspected to have Ebola, they should seek medical help immediately. What is the treatment? Severely ill patients require intensive supportive care. They need intravenous fluids to rehydrate them. But there is currently no specific treatment for the disease. Some patients will recover with the appropriate care.Can Ebola be prevented? Currently there is no licensed vaccine for Ebola. Several are being tested but are not available for clinical use. Is it safe to travel to affected areas? The World Health Organisation reviews the public health situation regularly, and recommends travel or trade restrictions if necessary. The risk of infection for travellers is very low since person-to-person transmission results from direct contact with bodily fluids of victims.Source: World Health Organisation .","The first symptoms include a fever, headache and sore throat .

"With a stern expression and his eyes firmly fixed across the Devon landscape, this cliff formation bears resemblance to a wizened old man. The similarity to a hardened and wrinkled face on the cliff edge was spotted by local James Norton near Salcombe, in South Devon. The image was posted by Mr Norton on the Toad Hall Cottages Facebook page and attracted more than 500 'likes' and numerous comments. One compared the formation to the fictional character Treebeard from Lord of the Rings. The cliff formation gives the appearance of a man looking out to sea - it was spotted by local James Norton . Another local, Darren Bines, said: 'No one has ever noticed it before, it's really weird. 'It's something to do with weathering, the grass and a minor rock fall, which has literally brought the face to life.' Christine Bolsover suggested the mysterious man looked 'a bit grumpy', which was followed by the inevitable response: 'He's got a heart of stone.' Earlier this year, ferocious storms battered  the cliffs at Hope Cove, near Salcombe, Devon, and led to chunks of it eroding and crumbling away.","Cliff formation near Salcombe, in South Devon, looks like a bearded man .

"An iPhone user told of his shock today after being hit with a £19,000 bill for his internet usage. Chris Bovis, from Tilbury, Essex, contacted his phone company, Orange, when they cut off his phone without warning. The 26-year-old builder was told he had racked up a bill of £8,900 down to unusually high internet usage. He claims the adviser then warned him his next bill was due to be another £10,000. Thought it was a joke: Chris Bovis with a letter from Orange demanding payment of a £19,000 for internet usage on his mobile which appears to have occured due to a fault with the mobile device . Mr Bovis said: 'My first reaction was to . laugh as I just could not believe it but it stopped being funny when I . realised they were not joking and were totally serious.' Orange tried to take the £19,000 for the months of October and November from his bank account, only for the transaction to be blocked. The problem appears to have been caused by a fault which meant his iPhone started sending and receiving large amounts of data in error. Mr Bovis and his partner Joanna Russo have been left disgusted by the treatment they received, which they say even included threats to send bailiffs around. He asked for his rogue iPhone to be switched off, but even when it was off it continued to automatically send and receive large amounts of internet data. A bid to stop the problem by restoring the factory settings had no impact either. Read it and weep: The letter from Orange explained that Mr Bovis's contract would be suspended until he paid his outstanding £19,000 balance. The firm has since said it will not charge him anything if his phone manufacturer confirms the glitch . Baffled staff at the Apple store agreed that the phone was faulty and agreed to replace it. But Mr Bovis's nightmare did not end there - as Orange said they would still be charging him a capped bill of a whopping £300. He claims that when told the mobile phone giant that he would not be forking out cash beyond his normal billing amount he was warned of the heavy-handed response. His partner Miss Russo added: 'Chris was advised that the £300 was simply not up for discussion and that he must pay up. 'We were told that failure to do so would mean they would be sending a bailiff round for the full amount of the original bill of £8,907. 'The erroneous debt would have had a massive impact on both our lives as our house could have been blacklisted - that is if we had still had a house at the end of it all.' Apologetic: Orange said it would scrap the bill once it has received confirmation of the glitch from the phone manufacturer . Mr Bovis was sent a letter from his bank saying they had blocked a transaction of £19,000 which Orange had tried to take from his account. Orange has now accepted they were wrong to try and bill Chris for the faulty phone and have apologised. An Orange spokesman said: 'We would like to apologise to Mr Bovis for any distress caused by receiving this unusually high phone bill . 'It does appear that this resulted from a fault with his device and we are happy to reduce the bill to zero as soon as we have received confirmation of the fault from his manufacturer.'","Chris Bovis, 26, thought it was a joke when he was cut off without warning .

"School pupils were given soft toy penises and vaginas by a Swiss education ministry project,  sparking a referendum in the Alpine country. The initiative was the brainchild of a group of parents in the northern city of Basel that led the demand for schools to drop the 'Sexbox' education kits. The kits, which were to teach kids from primary school upwards about sex, were eventually banned after widespread protest, but the campaigners now want a country-wide ban on sex education for children under nine. A Swiss education ministry project that involved pupils being given soft toy penises and vaginas has sparked outrage. The vote was ordered after campaigners gathered more than the 100,000 signatures of voters required to put their measure to the public for approval. The campaign coalition - whose goal is the 'protection against sexualisation in kindergartens and primary schools' - handed in its petition in December and the government is now obliged to set a date for a vote. Referendums are the bedrock of Switzerland's system of direct democracy, with voters called out several times a year to voice their opinion on a host of issues at local through to federal level. Some of the iterms in the 'sexbox'. Now parents are voting on the future of sex education for children . The sexbox kits included accessories such as soft-toy penises, which the parents' group said was tantamount to handing out pornography to children . The measure stipulates that sex education is the business of a child's parents and not the school system. While it would allow classes on avoiding the risk of sexual abuse, it would ban sex education for anyone below the age of nine, while such lessons would be optional for children up to the age of 12. For older children, compulsory lessons would be permitted, but they would be required to be given by biology teachers and focus on 'reproduction and human development'. No pupil would be required to follow a class that strayed beyond the basically biological to address such themes as the social aspects of sexuality. The sexbox kits included accessories such as soft-toy penises, which the parents' group said was tantamount to handing out pornography to children, who needed protecting against sexualisations at a young age.","Parents horrified after primary school pupils were given the plush genitalia .

"A brazen new online black market where users can buy drugs, forgeries and hacking services has broken cover to advertise itself in a YouTube clip. Looking like an advert for a well-funded Silicon Valley start-up, the slick promo video for Atlantis boasts that it is 'the world's best anonymous online drug marketplace' It comes as the site's backers announced the launch of a 'big social media campaign' that seems intended to make a play for the market share of the better-known Silk Road. Dangerous drugs: A screengrab of of the Atlantis online marketplace shows some of the illegal drugs on offer, including heroin, cannabis, MDMA and LSD . The products categories listed on Atlantis, which include drugs, drug paraphernalia, forgeries and money, leave little doubt that laws are being broken. Some of the products on sale include ecstasy pills, MDMA crystals, speed, cannabis, LSD, heroin and a range of designer compounds, all available for mail order as if they were bought on Amazon. Elsewhere services including Facebook account hacking and free access to Netflix, as well as tools that might be useful to criminals, are on offer. Users pay using the anonymous online currency Bitcoin, or its new competitor Litecoin, heavily encrypted payment services which disguise the parties in transactions. In an illicit online world that has hitherto been dominated by one site - Silk Road - Atlantis's decision to advertise may be a desperate move to take a bigger grab of existing market share. Silk Road, in operation since 2011, remains by far the biggest illicit internet bazaar, with one researcher estimating that it attracts 60,000 unique visitors a day and a recent study estimating annual sales worth $22million (£14.5million), Forbes reported. Like Silk Road, Atlantis is only accessible through the Tor network, an anonymising service which purports to foil attempts to track internet users' online activities. Tor, whose name is short for The Onion Router, bounces web traffic around a worldwide network of nodes - dubbed onion routes - adding layers of encryption to make users untraceable. The system works both ways, and while users can use Tor to anonymously browse mainstream websites, they can also exploit it to anonymous post websites without revealing their physical location. This anonymity has allowed for an explosion of criminality online, with users swapping child porn, selling drugs or advertising illegal services - earning it the nickname of the 'dark net'. Silk Road, despite a string of newspaper exposes in recent months, has at least made an effort to be more discreet, not actively advertising its website address, for example. Instead, those curious must find someone to tell them the website address or otherwise find it by browsing elsewhere on the so-called 'dark net'. The new advert for Atlantis, which is almost certainly against YouTube's terms of service, asks viewers to 'meet Charlie', a 'stoner' who has moved cities for work and has since been unable to find any 'dank buds'. 'He didn't think he'd ever find weed again, until he found Atlantis,' it says. The story ends with Charlie getting 'high as a damn kite' thanks to the purchase he made through the site. It concludes: 'So now that big problem Charlie had has completely gone away!' A person claiming to the the online bazaar's CEO recently told Reddit users on an 'ask me anything' thread: 'We want to bring attention to the site and bring our vendors more buyers. He said he wasn't concerned that drawing attention to the site might attract any unwanted attention from police. 'Law enforcement is going to be aware of us (and probably already is) regardless of the way we choose to put our product out there,' he said. Although Atlantis is set up to facilitate transactions involving a string of dangerous drugs and illegal services, its CEO, whose Reddit account has since been deleted, says there are limits to what is acceptable on the site. 'We do not allow listings such as child pornography and necrophilia,' he said. 'We do take a moral stance, there's a large difference between child pornography and drugs.' He added: 'Restricted items include anything related to paedophilia, poisons, loans, investment opportunities, assassination services or anything which can inflict harm on another person. 'If you infringe on these rules we will terminate your account instantly.' From the responses he gives to various questions on the Reddit AMA, it is clear that the CEO, whoever he is, believes there is little chance authorities can act against Atlantis. 'We have team members in various different countries,' he said. 'I would say physical location is relatively irrelevant. 'We can access our systems from anywhere, and our location and the server location is protected by the Tor hidden service network.'","Illicit online bazaar breaks cover with YouTube clip advert .

"Wearing only loincloths and with their arms stretched in the air, these men look like they are begging for a set of clothes. But they are, in fact, trying to grab a pair of lucky sticks being thrown by a priest at a temple in Okayama, Japan. The sacred batons - measuring 4cm in diameter and 20cm in length - are believed to bring good luck for an entire year to whoever catches them. Unusual sight: More than 9,000 Japanese men can be seen trying to grab a pair of lucky sticks thrown by a priest during the Hadaka Matsuri at Saidaiji Temple today . Fighting for happiness: The sacred items - measuring 4cm in diameter and 20cm in length - are believed to bring good luck for an entire year to whoever catches them . Painful: Three men support each other (left) during the event - known as the Naked Festival - while a participant winces in pain (right) as a peer fastens his loincloth . More than 9,000 men took part in the Hadaka Matsuri - known as the Naked Festival - at Saidaiji Temple today. They donned white Japanese loincloths with the help of their peers, before stepping into cold fountains, where they purified their bodies with water. They then battled fiercely with each other in a bid to grab the pair of lucky sticks - known as the shingi - which were thrown into the crowd by a priest from a four-metre high window. According to Japanese tradition, anyone who gets catches the items and thrusts them in a wooden measuring box, called the masu, is blessed with 12 months of luck and happiness. Purifying their bodies: During the festival in Okayama, the men donned white loincloths, before stepping into cold fountains (pictured), where they purified their bodies . Vicious battle: They then struggled fiercely with each other in a bid to grab the pair of lucky sticks - known as the shingi - which were thrown into the crowd by a priest . The unusual event - one of the most vibrant festivals in Japan - dates back 500 years when worshippers used to compete to receive paper talismans thrown by the priest. Over the years, an increasing number of people receiving these talismans possessed good fortune - encouraging more worshippers to turn up. However, the talismans were later changed to wooden sticks due to the fragile nature of paper. The Hadaka Matsuri is not the only festival in Japan which requires participants to bare all. Tradition: The festival dates back 500 years when men used to compete to receive paper talismans thrown by the priest. Above, a man smiles as he puts on his loincloth . Last month, around 100 men took part in the ancient Shinto festival of Kanchu Misogi - a winter purification ritual that is supposed to cleanse the body and soul and bring worshippers closer to mystical spirits, which they believe can bring them success. In temperatures of just 40F (6C), the participants stripped down to loincloths and headbands before taking a dip in the pool at Teppozu Inari Shinto shrine. They then crouched down in the freezing water to pray - before hugging large blocks of ice.","More than 9,000 Japanese men took part in Hadaka Matsuri - known as Naked Festival - at Saidaiji Temple today .

"Ruling: Immigration Judge Jonathan Perkins, pictured, said Ali can stay in Britain . A Sudanese asylum seeker who raped a 12-year-old girl has been allowed to remain in Britain – after a judge ruled it would breach his human rights to deport him. Sani Adil Ali was jailed for raping the girl just months after he was given refugee status. When he was sentenced, another judge described him as ‘a potential danger to young girls’ and put him on the Sex Offenders’ Register for the rest of his life. But after serving a three-year . sentence, an immigration tribunal ruled Ali could stay in Britain on the . grounds that he could be in danger if he returned to Sudan. Senior . immigration judge Jonathan Perkins allowed the 28-year-old to remain in . Britain, even though the rapist’s probation officers found that he . presented some risk to young people. In . his ruling, Judge Perkins said: ‘We find that the appellant is still . entitled to the protection of the Refugee Convention and the . Qualification Directive. 'In any event, removing him would be contrary to . the United Kingdom’s obligations under the European Convention on Human . Rights.’ It is not the . first time that Judge Perkins has made a controversial decision. Last . month, The Mail on Sunday reported how he allowed an Afghan Muslim, who . claimed he killed people while fighting for the Taliban, to remain in . Britain. It has also been . reported that Judge Perkins has often allowed foreign criminals to . remain in Britain because of their ‘right to a family life’ under the . Human Rights Act. His latest decision is another setback for Home Secretary Theresa May, whose plans to crack down on the . way foreign criminals use human rights to avoid being deported appear . to be repeatedly undermined by the courts. Charlie . Elphicke, Conservative MP for Dover & Deal, who has tabled a Bill . to replace the Human Rights Act with a British Bill of Rights, said: . ‘Britain will always be there to provide refuge to those in need. But . people who commit crimes here should be sent back immediately. ‘Right-thinking people in Britain will be appalled that this person will be allowed to stay here. It sums up what is wrong with the European human rights laws. ‘We should have zero tolerance of refugees who commit crimes. Cases like this are why I have tabled a British Bill of Rights so we can control our borders and ensure that foreign criminals and terrorists are deported immediately.’ Ali had attacked the 12-year-old girl while he was staying with her family during a five-day trip to Sheffield . Threat: Judge Jonathan Perkins allowed an Afghan Muslim, who claimed he killed people while fighting for the Taliban, similar to those pictured, to remain in Britain . Ali, who is from the Darfur region, arrived in Britain in October 2003 and was awarded refugee status in February 2005. But two months later he was arrested at his address in Middlesbrough over the rape of a 12-year-old  Hungarian girl. Ali had attacked her while staying with her family during a five-day trip to Sheffield. The victim’s family had offered to put him up while he visited his friend, Kamel Ahmed, then 22, also from Darfur. Ali and Ahmed knew each other and the girl’s family from refugee camps in Italy and France. Ali, who pleaded guilty to one count of child rape, was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment at Sheffield Crown Court. Ahmed was convicted of three counts of child rape and jailed for ten years. Michael Joseph QC, pictured, said he regarded Ali as a 'potential danger to young girls' when sentencing him for the rape of a 12-year-old . Judge Michael Murphy QC, said: ‘I regard each of you as a potential danger to young girls and so each of you will be banned for the rest of your life from ever taking up a job which involves working with children under 16.’ When Ali was released from Doncaster jail in 2008, the Home Office ordered that he return to Sudan and he was locked up in an immigration removal centre. Ali appealed to the immigration court and when a judge rejected his bid, he mounted a fresh appeal to the Upper Tribunal Immigration and Asylum Chamber. At the Sheffield hearing, Judge Perkins ruled that removing Ali, who comes from the Zaghawa tribe, would breach his rights under Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits torture or inhumane punishment. Judge Perkins referred to a 2009 ruling which stated that non-Arab tribes such as the Zaghawa are ‘at risk of persecution in Darfur and cannot reasonably be expected to relocate elsewhere in Sudan’. The judge also said Ali could not be deported because he was not a danger to the public, and therefore could not have his refugee status taken away from him. He said that even though his probation officers found he ‘presented some risk to young people’, Ali had ‘faced up to his responsibilities and indicated an intention to behave himself in the future’. It is believed Ali was allowed to leave the immigration removal centre around 2009 and then moved to Newcastle, and still lives in the North East. It is not known if he received legal aid to fund his immigration fight. Last night the Government admitted it was powerless in the face of the tribunal’s decision, with an aide to Mrs May stressing there was nothing the Home Secretary could do. ‘We are at the mercy of the courts,’ they said. The UK Border Agency said: ‘We do not believe this individual needs or deserves refuge in this country.’","Sani Adil Ali was described as a 'potential danger to young girls' by the judge who sentenced him for the sex attack on the child .

"The startling appearance of a ‘blue’ fox at a Travelodge has sparked a mystery in south-east London. Guests at the busy hotel in Woolwich were shocked when the bewildered fox wandered inside and had to be coaxed out with a packet of crisps. What made the situation even more bizarre was the animal’s coat, which had somehow become covered in blue paint. A fox covered in blue paint or dye surprised guests when it wandered into a Travelodge in Woolwich . Guests whipped out their smartphones to snap photos of the fox, which appeared to be cowering in a corner at one point. It mooched around the bar and reception area, looking a little confused, as staff and guests devised a plan. One guest, now dubbed ‘a fox whisperer’, managed to lure the fox outside by laying a trail of Doritos. Referring to comedian Lenny Henry, who appears in adverts for Travelodge rival Premier Inn, guest Scott Farnell, who photographed the urban fox, tweeted: ‘What’s going on here then? Lenny Henry wouldn’t stand for this?’ Guest Scott Farnell said a man managed to lure the fox back outside by laying a trail of Doritos . Scott said he was scared of the animal and the hotel receptionist tried contact the RSPCA for help but there was no answer. A second photo showed a man laying a trail of crisps. Scott added: ‘Fox whisperer has taken care of him. Likes Doritos.’ The RSPCA said they were investigating the incident. Mr Farnell tweeted photos of the fox and told his Twitter followers that he was scared of the animal . Guests said the hotel receptionist attempted to contact the RSPCA but there was no answer . A spokesman said they had not seen a blue fox before and don't know how it managed to become that colour. With more than 35,000 urban foxes in London, it’s not unusual for encounters of the unusual kind to be reported. To keep foxes at bay the Royal Borough of Greenwich recommends residents and businesses ensure their bins are securely shut, that rubbish sacks are not left beside their wheelie bins, and that they never feed the animals.","'Blue' fox wandered into a Travelodge Hotel in Woolwich, south London .

"From the man who swears that garlic sandwiches give his love life a boost to the intrepid soul who thinks putting leeches on your bottom can cure deep vein thrombosis, the home remedies championed by the British can seem a motley bunch. But few can be as bizarre as the claims made by builders Simon and Andy, who say that industrial lubricant WD-40 can help cure arthritis and ease a congested chest. The duo made their odd claim on Channel 4 documentary series Health Freaks, which offers people with a home remedy they swear by the chance to have it checked over by a panel of doctors. Magic spray: Andy (left) and Simon claim that industrial lubricant WD-40 is the cure for arthritis and chest pain . Currently, more than 10 million people suffer from arthritis in the UK alone, and the cost to the NHS runs into millions. Andy, who suffers from the condition, said: 'I went to the doctor and he prescribed me paracetamol for my arthritis. 'I sprayed WD-40 on my knees and it seemed to be better.' 'At first I thought he was completely . mad and then I saw what it was doing for him so I thought I'd give it a . go,' added fellow bricklayer Simon. 'It works for me. Thousands of bricklayers across the country can't . be wrong!' Unsurprisingly, the panel of medics were unimpressed. 'As far as I know, there's nothing in . WD-40 that would have an effect on the joints apart from the cooling . effect and the fact that rubbing helps,' said veteran GP, Dr. Ayan Panja. Unimpressed: Dr Ayan Panja (left) and Dr Ellie Cannon said using the lubricant as medicine could be dangerous . Asked if he was worried about any potentially toxic side-effects of using WD-40, Andy added: 'No, I'm not worried about toxins. If you do your research, you'll see there are fish oils in WD-40.' Simon, meanwhile, claimed that the product had helped ease his congested chest. 'I'm a smoker and I suffer with a tight . chest,' he explained. 'I apply WD-40 and makes it better and it takes seconds.' Once again, the panel failed to see his point. 'When smokers have a tight chest, it's . actually their lungs which are tight not their chest,' said Dr Ellie Cannon, a long-standing GP. 'There's no way . that WD-40 can be getting through to your lungs to actually improve your . breathing.' She added: 'This is one of the craziest ideas I've ever heard, I would advise you to stop doing it and to seek proper treatment.' Real use: The makers of WD-40 say the lubricant works better on bumpers than it does on human joints . Asked by MailOnline to comment on the claims, a spokesman for WD-40 said: 'This is one of the myths we regularly deal with. 'The WD-40 Company does not recommend the use of WD-40 Multi-Use Product for medical purposes, and knows no reason why it would be effective for arthritis pain relief. 'The product contains petroleum distillates and should be handled with the same precautions for any product containing this type of material.' Among other unusual remedies featured in the documentary were amber necklaces and duct tape, thought to soothe teething pains and cure veruccas. Although the duct tape was later proved to have an impressive effect on tackling veruccas, the amber beads did not impress the panel of GPs and, according to the medical professionals, does nothing to soothe teething pain in babies. Health Freaks airs tonight at 8.30pm on Channel 4 .","Claim was made by builder Andy during an appearance on Health Freaks .

"A high-priced prostitute injected a married Google executive with a fatal dose of heroin before callously stepping over his dying body to finish her glass of wine, police have revealed. Alix Tichelman, 26, was arrested on Friday in the death of Forrest Hayes, a 51-year-old father-of-five and former Apple exec, aboard his yacht in Santa Cruz, California last November. Tichelman, who met her clients through a website called Seeking Arrangement, had exchanged texts and emails with Hayes and met with him a few times before the deadly November 26 encounter. That day, they met on Hayes' 50-foot yacht, Escape, at the Santa Cruz Small Craft Harbor and Tichelman brought heroin before injecting him with the drug, police said. Scroll down for video . 'Callous': Alex Tichelman, 26, left, did nothing as her wealthy client Forrest Hayes, right, suffered complications from a heroin overdose and died. Instead of calling 911, she gathered her belongings and left, police said . Surveillance video from inside the luxury boat shows Hayes 'suffering medical complications' and losing consciousness - but Tichelman makes no attempt to help him or call 911, police said. Instead, she is seen gathering her belongings, stepping over his dying body to finish her glass of wine and then leaving the boat - pulling a window blind down to conceal his body from outside. Hayes was found dead the next morning by the boat's captain, the Santa Cruz Sentinel reported. 'She showed no regard for him. She was just trying to cover her tracks,' Santa Cruz Deputy Police Chief Steve Clark said on Tuesday. Authorities launched a nine-month investigation into the incident and uncovered Tichelman's correspondence with the victim. Working girl: Tichelman was a high-price prostitute and met her clients, including Hayes, online . 'We know they've had a previous . relationship, they've shared time together before,' Clark told KION. 'This was all set up . through text messages and emails. We also know what she did in the . aftermath of this. We have her computer records, we know the Google . searches that she made, the things she did to try to get herself out of . this.' Police identified Tichelman from the video and also found her fingerprints on the wine glass, police said. They then tracked her down to her home in Folsom, where she lives with her parents, but lured her back to Santa Cruz County by posing as a client who said he wanted to pay her $1,000 for sex. She agreed to meet at a luxury hotel on Fourth of July and was arrested. She was booked into jail on suspicion of second-degree murder, concealing evidence and transportation of narcotics on Friday and remains there on a $1.5 million bond. When asked if the overdose was accidental or intentional, Clark said evidence showed a level of guilt that reached second-degree murder rather than involuntary manslaughter, the Sentinel reported. Scene: She allegedly took the heroin to his yacht, pictured, and administered the drug but as he lay dying, she stepped over his body to finish a glass of wine before leaving the boat . 'She showed absolutely no regard for this person she injected with heroin,' Clark said. 'She had a responsibility to provide some lifesaving effort.' Detectives said they are also investigating Tichelman for a similar death in another state. Hayes, who was originally from Dearborn, Michigan was married for 17 years to wife Denise and together they had five children, according to his obituary. He worked in the auto industry before senior roles at Apple and Google. 'Forrest will be remembered above all as a loving husband and father. More than anything else he enjoyed spending time with his family at home and on his boat,' according to a January obituary. 'His brilliant mind, contagious smile and warm embrace will be missed and cherished in memories by his friends and family.' Tichelman's Facebook profile shows she went to high school in Atlanta before majoring in journalism at Georgia State University and attending beauty school. She lists her occupation as a makeup artist. Fetish fan: Tichelman was arrested on Friday after police posed as a client and met her at a hotel . Dark: In an interview, she said she had always been obsessed with horror movies; police called her 'callous' She called herself a 'model' in jail records. On social media, she poses in lingerie and pouts with red lips for the camera, and posts suggest she had a boyfriend as recently as a couple of months ago. In an interview with fiXE fETISH magazine, she said she loved modeling because she got to play a character. 'I have always been attracted to the darker side,' she said. 'My parents said by the time I was three I was an ""intense child"" and already liked horror movies.' She added that she loved fetishism and would often wear a leash when she went out with her nightclub owner boyfriend. She also posted pictures under another Facebook profile, AK Kennedy, and talks about heroin and her love of the TV show about a serial killer, 'Dexter'. Seeking Arrangement, the website through which Tichelman and Hayes met, is described as being a site for connecting 'sugar babies' with 'sugar daddies and mommas' - but the company maintains it is not promoting prostitution.","Alex Tichelman, 26, 'injected father-of-five Forrest Hayes, 51, with heroin last November but did nothing when he had a reaction to the drug'

"Couples tying the knot can meticulously plan their wedding down to the smallest detail, from the colour of the chair decorations to the timing of the first dance. But while you can more-or-less guarantee everything will be flawless on the big day, there is one vital exception - the weather. However, a travel company is now offering a ‘perfect day’ package – including control over the weather – for an eye-watering £100,000. Travel Company Oliver's Travels is offering a wedding package that claims to be able to control the weather. It employs a 'cloud bursting' service - a technique that involves firing rockets filled with silver iodide crystals into rain clouds from light aircraft . Oliver’s Travels says its ‘cloud bursting’ service will guarantee blue skies on the special day. Staffed by a team of highly-specialised meteorologists and pilots, the company are able to fly a light aircraft above the clouds, sprinkling them with silver particles which cause the clouds to burst and vanish in time for the ceremony. Otherwise known as cloud seeding, the technique involves firing rockets filled with silver iodide crystals into rain clouds from light aircraft or the ground. The icy particles freeze water droplets so that they continue growing in size and eventually fall out of the cloud as snow which turns to rain before it reaches the ground. Couples tying the knot can meticulously plan their wedding down to the smallest detail - except one vital exception - the weather . However, the method only works on small or medium-sized clouds and there are also environmental concerns about using silver iodide. Cloud-seeding is used around the world to prevent fog at airports, stop hail damage in cities or to boost snowfall at ski resorts. The luxury travel company, which organises destination weddings st stately homes and castles in England, France and Italy as well as beach weddings in the Caribbean, has introduced the new service for its most high-end customers. The technique was developed in 1940s Russia so that the weather would not disturb Soviet rallies, and new technology and research have produced reliable results that make cloud seeding a dependable activity. It is now considered a mainstream tool and it has become a tradition in China to ‘seed’ clouds before public holidays to induce rain, disperse pollution and ensure clear blue skies. Staffed by a team of highly-specialised meteorologists, the company  fly a light aircraft above the clouds, sprinkling them with silver iodide particles which cause clouds to burst and vanish ahead of the ceremony . Cloud seeding is now considered a mainstream tool and was also used ahead of the 2008 Beijing Olympics opening ceremony to create a downpour elsewhere and keep the stadium dry . The technique, which was developed in Russia in the 1940s, has become a tradition in China, where clouds are seeded before public holidays to induce rain, disperse pollution and ensure clear blue skies . It was also used ahead of the 2008 Beijing Olympics opening ceremony to create a downpour elsewhere and keep the stadium dry. This involved firing rockets packed with silver iodide crystals into rain clouds over the suburbs of Beijing. It was also reportedly used by Paul McCartney at one of his gigs in 2003, and at the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding in 2012. Oliver Bell, Co-Founder of Oliver’s Travels commented: ‘We pride ourselves on our quirky approach, and are thrilled to be able to offer such an unusual, unique service to our customers, to ensure their wedding is the talk of the town.’ In recent years, Chinese air force jets have flown more than 3,000 flights and sowed rain-making chemicals to bring down 210 billion cubic metres of water over three million square kilometres, nearly a third of China's territory. Cloud seeding was also reportedly used by Paul McCartney at one of his gigs in 2003, and at the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding in 2012 . The technique is regularly used to boost rainfall in drought-stricken areas of China. It is also possible to ‘over nucleate’ clouds with many particles so that they hold in their moisture until they have passed over the target area, experts say. Musician Paul McCartney is once said to have spent £22,000 on three jets to fire dry ice into clouds hovering over St Petersburg ahead of an open-air gig. However, thirty-five deaths in the 1952 Lynmouth flood disaster were linked at the time to RAF rain-making experiments over southern England a few days earlier, although nothing was proved. One company said they had been contacted by a major British music festival about the possibility of cloud seeding but when the complexities were explained to the organisers and the fact that 'we could not provide any guarantee that we could make it not rain; they decided against it. Steve Hilton, David Cameron's former Director of Strategy, reportedly floated the idea of buying in cloud-bursting technology to extend the British summer. The policy guru believed a sunnier climate would make us all happier and more productive. However, the idea was dismissed as crazy by fellow Westminster aides.","Oliver’s Travels say  service will guarantee blue skies on the special day .

"Kate Moss brought a dose of rock ‘n roll glamour to a rural retreat better known as ‘the Cotswolds of Scotland’. The supermodel and her celebrity friends took the £150-a-night Craigellachie Hotel at the weekend - a rural Speyside getaway - as they celebrated nutritionist Rose Ferguson’s 40th birthday with a Burns-themed bash. They were joined by the likes of Noel Gallagher, Nick Grimshaw and Sadie Frost for a wild weekend of partying on the banks of the River Spey – an area once known as a favourite destination of Queen Victoria. Scroll down for video . Supermodel Kate Moss and her husband Jamie Hince leaving the Craigellachie Hotel on Sunday night . Kate Moss brought a dose of rock ‘n roll glamour to the Craigellachie Hotel - a rural retreat in Speyside dubbed ‘the Cotswolds of Scotland’ The 120-year-old country hotel has recently been re-opened after a £3m refurbishment. It features a renowned whiskey bar called The Quaich, which has one of Scotland’s biggest selections of single malt whiskys, and which stocks almost 1,000 bottles. The group also partied at the hotel’s newly-installed Copper Dog pub – where they tucked into a supper of haggis, neeps and tatties. The party was a traditionally Scottish affair, with a piper playing happy birthday on the bagpipes. The area is perhaps an unlikely destination for the supermodel. It is better known as an ‘angler’s paradise’, and the River Spey is famous for salmon, sea trout and brown trout fishing.

Originally built in 1893 as a destination for the Victorians who wanted to take in the clean air and enjoy the local countryside, The Craigellachie was bought last year by Piers Adam – the entrepreneur behind nightclubs including Mahiki and Cabaret. He decided to rejuvenate the hotel to its former glory following a visit to the Highlands three years ago. The Copper Dog pub has been installed in the basement of the hotel and provided the venue for a hard night of partying for Kate Moss and her celebrity friends .

The hotel's 28 bedrooms has been restored, maintaining original features such a fireplaces and antique furniture, the en-suites have also been refurbished in keeping with the traditional feel of the hotel . He came across the hotel by chance after travelling to the area with his father who had been evacuated to the area during WW2. He said: ‘When I first stayed at The Craigellachie I instantly fell in love with the place. However I was saddened that it had become run down and lost some of its spark. ‘For the next year or so I kept my eye on the sale of the hotel hoping that someone would buy and restore it, and then I made the snap decision to buy it myself. Many of the fabrics used in the soft furnishings have been sourced from local mills and the shortbread and water are from local businesses . Speyside features the largest concentration of Scotch whisky distilleries in the country including Glenfiddich and Macallan . The hotel also features a billiards room and a basement cinema room which can be used for private screenings . ‘Most of my businesses are related to bars and restaurants in London and internationally so I really hadn’t considered a hotel in the Highlands of Scotland. ‘However, there is something special about The Craigellachie and Speyside. There is a real sense of community in the area and I really want The Craigellachie to continue to be part of that.’ Throughout the hotel each of the 28 bedrooms has been restored, maintaining original features such a fireplaces and antique furniture, the en-suites have also been refurbished in keeping with the traditional feel of the hotel.

"CoverGirl has come out against domestic violence, but continued to show support for the NFL, in a statement released late last night. After saying they are a brand that has long 'supported women and stood for female empowerment,' they called on the NFL 'to take swift action on their path forward to address the issue of domestic violence.' The brand, which bills itself as the 'official beauty sponsor of the NFL,' became a part of the discussion regarding the league's handling of domestic abuse offenses over the weekend when photoshopped versions of their NFL ads depicting battered women went viral. Scroll down for video . PR nightmare: A photoshopped version of the CoverGirl ad directed at Baltimore Ravens fans (above), the team Ray Rice formerly played for . Statement; CoverGirl says they are urging the NFL to take 'swift action' in solving its domestic violence problem, as these photoshopped ads (above) continue to go viral . They also stated their belief that 'domestic violence is completely unacceptable.' The full statement reads, 'As a brand that has always supported women and stood for female empowerment, CoverGirl believes domestic violence is completely unacceptable. We developed our NFL program to celebrate the more than 80 million female football fans. In light of recent events, we have encouraged the NFL to take swift action on their path forward to address the issue of domestic violence.' Unfortunately, this was not enough for some of those 80 million female football fans the cosmetic giant claims to be reaching with their NFL partnership, who called on parent company Procter & Gamble to do more in the wake of the two recent high profile domestic abuse incidents involving star players Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson. Some are even urging a boycott of CoverGirl on Twitter until they take stronger action or withdraw their sponsorship entirely.

The photshopped ads were not even originally meant as an attack on CoverGirl, but rather an attempt to shame NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, using the hashtag #GoodellMustGo. This comes after video of Rice punching then-fiancée Janay Palmer went public last Monday, and Peterson was indicted on charges of reckless or negligent injury to a child on Friday for an incident in which he hit his son with a switch back in May. Rice has been indefinitely suspended from the NFL and had his contract terminated by the Baltimore Ravens, while Peterson, who was sidelined by the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday, will return to team play this weekend.","CoverGirl has released a statement showing their continued support for the NFL in the wake of the Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson scandals .

"Nine long-lost episodes of Doctor Who, which have not been seen since the 1960s, have been recovered after they were tracked down gathering dust in a store room in Nigeria. The discovery will cause much excitement for devotees of the long-running series, for which there are dozens of missing episodes dating back to its early years . The previously lost nine shows were among 11 traced to a television relay station and the find brings back to life an entire six-episode story, while another is almost complete. Scroll down for video . Patrick Troughton in Doctor Who: Web Of Fear, one of nine long-lost episodes of Doctor Who which have not been seen since the 1960s . Fright: Tina Packer, playing Anne Travers, being attacked by a yeti in Doctor Who: The Web Of Fear . The newly found programmes - which introduce the character of Alistair Lethbridge-Stewart, better known to audiences as The Brigadier - will be available on iTunes from today and will later come out on DVD. Phillip Morris, the director of Television International Enterprises Archive, unearthed the programmes by looking up the records of overseas shipments of tapes made by the BBC. The stories, The Enemy Of The World (1967) and The Web Of Fear (1968) and both starring Patrick Troughton as the second Doctor, have now been remastered by BBC Worldwide, the corporation's commercial arm. Treasure trove: The episodes were recovered after they were tracked down to a store room in Nigeria, gathering dust . The Doctor goes toe-to-toe with a Yeti. The find will delight Doctor Who's legion of fans . Mr Morris said: 'I remember wiping the dust off the masking tape on the canisters and my heart missed a beat as I saw the words Doctor Who. When I read the story code, I realised I'd found something pretty special.' Only one episode of The Enemy Of The World - which featured Deborah Watling as companion Victoria, and Frazer Hines, later to find fame in Emmerdale as Jamie - had remained in the archives, so the addition of programmes one, two, four, five and six have completed the story. Fiona Eastwood, director of consumer products, BBC Worldwide, said: 'We are thrilled with the recent discovery of The Web Of Fear and The Enemy Of The World and we're very happy to be launching re-mastered versions of these treasured episodes to fans as we celebrate the 50th year of Doctor Who.' Days of Future Past: Mary Peach as Astrid in Doctor Who: The Enemy Of The World . Fear: Deborah and Patrick, the assistants of Doctor Who . The BBC still had the first edition in the Web Of Fear story, and the new finds mean only number three is missing. The tale introduced Nicholas Courtney as Lethbridge-Stewart, who began with the rank of Colonel but later became Brigadier. The missing episode has been recreated using 37 still images which were available and the original audio which survived. Many programmes from the era, along with many classic shows, disappeared as a result of efforts to save space. There are still 27 Doctor Who stories which have not been recovered or for which episodes are missing. In total, 97 episodes are still unaccounted for. One episode from both The Enemy of the World and The Web of Fear were shown at a special BBC event in London yesterday. Episode one of The Enemy of the World is said to be akin to an early James Bond film, with armed villains, a foreign villain and a scene featuring an exploding helicopter. The Web of fear meanwhile sees the Doctor locked in battle with the Great Intelligence in the tunnels of the London Underground. The BBC was even accused of secretly filming at an Underground station at the time as its sets were deemed so realistic. Guests at yesterday's screening included the actors who played Troughton's Tardis companions, Frazer Hines and Deborah Watling. The show celebrates its half-century on November 23.

"A mother-of-nine who claims £38,000 a year in handouts and demanded a bigger council house for her huge family is pregnant again - this time with twins. Cheryl Prudham, 32, and her husband Robert, 29, are set to receive at least a further £1,400 in handouts when the baby girls arrive. Mrs Prudham said she will 'not be made to feel guilty' for having children' as she and her husband both work part-time. Mother-of-nine Cheryl Prudham who claims £38,000 a year in handouts and demanded a bigger council house for her huge family is pregnant again - this time with twins . Last year the couple, from Sittingbourne, Kent  - who were living . in a three-bedroom council house at the time - said they were entitled . to a bigger house, because they both work part-time. Eventually the couple were able to arrange a house swap and they moved to a £200,000 property, also in Kent, the Sun reports. But the expectant mother is still not happy with the swap - organised via Facebook with a family looking to downsize - because she had to move away from her preferred area of Sittingbourne. She admits her huge brood were not especially planned because she and her husband do not like using contraception. Speaking after her bid for a new house last year, she said: 'In the past I have been on contraception but I got pregnant with the coil and the pill just doesn't settle well with me. 'We don't use condoms and me and Rob have never talked about it. 'I did rely on benefits before but I am motivated to be more than a mother.' And she admitted: 'I was surprised by the cost of our kids in the end.' Cheryl had her first son George, 13, when she was just 17 and was living in a homeless hostel in Kent in the summer of 2000. She soon moved into a flat with her ex-boyfriend and had second son, Jack, 12, and her eldest daughter Caitlin, eight. The mother then had three unplanned pregnancies Maisie, seven, Lillie, five, and Madison, four. The couple are set to receive at least a further £1,400 in handouts when the baby girls arrive. Mrs Prudham said she will 'not be made to feel guilty' for having children' as she and her husband both work part-time . Mrs Prudham revealed that in her old house her children, who are aged between nine months and 13, sit on the floor to eat at meal times because there is not enough space for a dining table. In March 2009 she met current husband Rob and they had Leon, now three. They then had Lenny, now two, before completing the family with daughter Lainey in January this year - before she discovered she was pregnant once again with twins. The couple both recently started working 20 hours per week a week as carers. Neither pays any income tax because their earnings fall below the minimum threshold - earning them just under £1,400 a month. They then receive £400 child tax credits, topped up by £70 working tax credits, and their £123 a week rent is footed by the council. They already reportedly receive £7,326 a year in child benefit.","Cheryl and Robert Prudham last year demanded a bigger council house .

"A nine-months pregnant teenager who claims she was raped by seven men in Sudan is now facing the death penalty after being charged with adultery. The married Ethiopian woman was just 18 years old, and three months pregnant, when she was subjected to the attack in August last year. She says she was searching for a new home in Omdurman,  near the capital Khartoum, and one of the seven accused lured her into an empty property on the premises of renting it out to her and her husband. Unbelievable brutality: The pregnant Ethiopian teenager was raped by seven men after being lured into an empty building near the Sudanese capital of Khartoum, on the premise of renting the property (stock image) She was attacked and held down while a . group of men, reportedly aged between 18 and 22, took turns in raping . her, according to the Strategic Initiative for Women in the Horn of . Africa (SIHA) network. Her . ordeal was filmed by one of the perpetrators and was circulated on . social media via WhatsApp several months after the attack. When . the video of the rape surfaced, the woman and the alleged rapists were . arrested and accused of making and distributing indecent material and . indecent behaviour. After . first being denied bail, and later charged with prostitution and . adultery, the woman is now being prevented from making a formal . complaint of rape. Sudanese . media reporting the case has tried to undermine the woman's story by . claiming she has HIV and is a prostitute, SIHA said. The woman is being held by police and refused to report the rape by the Sudanese Attorney General as she is being investigated for adultery and incident behaviour (stock image) 'The . intention to place culpability on the part of the victim is of great . concern and seeks to deflect and reduce accountability of the . perpetrators, but more disturbing is that the charge of adultery carries . with it the potential sentence of death by stoning if found guilty,' SIHA said. 'There have . even been cynical attempts to falsely claim that the men were accidently . prescribed hallucinogenic drugs by a chemist beforehand.' 'Impunity . and silence on crimes of sexual violence committed against IDPs . [internally displaced persons], migrants and impoverished women in Sudan . has been a pattern for years,' Hala Alkarib, regional director of the . SIHA network, told the Guardian. 'Successful . prosecution of rape is the exception as opposed to the norm and most . certainly does not reflect the level of incidence. 'Instead victims face . the risk that they will instead be prosecuted for adultery, being . re-vicitmised by the judicial system, and threatened with the ultimate . sentence of death by stoning.' According . to SIHA, the Attorney General has denied her the right to report the . rape as she is currently under investigation for the other charges. The Attorney General also argues that she should have reported the rape at the time of the attack. However . the woman has told her lawyer that the group of men who attacked her . threatened to kill her if she told anyone, and as a result, she was too . scared to report it. She was . further deterred by the fact that she told a police officer who found . her shortly after the attack what had happened, who dismissed her story. The . police officer decided against pursuing an investigation as it was Eid . Al Fitr, a public holiday in the Muslim country, SIHA said. He has been . charged with negligence. The . teenager was arrested on the 17th of January and despite being close to . giving birth, she has since been sleeping on a concrete floor in a cell . at a local police station. Two attempts to secure bail for her on health grounds have been refused. A . total of ten individuals, including another police officer who helped . spread the video, are currently on trial related to this case.","The Ethiopian teenager was three months pregnant when she was attacked .

"It might seem like an impossible dream but a healthy, slender figure like Rosie Huntington-Whiteley's can be yours (genes and length of legs permitting, of course) without embarking on a fad diet, feeling guilty about food or spending hours pumping iron at the gym. That's what nutritionist-to-the-stars James Duigan, whose world famous Clean & Lean diet has picked up a host of celebrity fans from Elle Macpherson to David Gandy, Hugh Grant and, of course, Rosie H-W herself, says. Scroll down for exclusive video . Rosie used the Clean & Lean plan to get into shape for the Hollywood film Transformers: Dark of the Moon . Duigan has just updated and rereleased . his Clean & Lean plan for Kindle this month which promises to cut . the binge-regret-diet-bingle cycle endured by dieters and give . you a lean and lucious shape without bulking up or shrinking down. The revised and updated Clean & Lean plan can be . downloaded onto Kindles or iPhones and iPads using the Kindle app. And . even better for readers of Femail, Duigan has filmed a series of . exclusive exercise videos, each targeting a specific problem area, just for us. This . week, bottoms are getting the star treatment. Watch in the weeks to come . for other exclusive videos showing just how to improve your legs, tummy . and arms. Rosie is more than happy to show off the results of the Clean & Lean plan . In today's video, Duigan reveals three exercises which he promises will give you a 'perfect perky butt'. The hip extension exercise will 'switch your butt on' by engaging the glutes, while the lying side leg raises give a 'incredibly effective exercise for working your butt without bulking up' he promises. The final one, the mini band walking, is so effective he says that he trained an actress for a Hollywood action movie and 'after a month of doing this exercise her butt had lifted so much that they has to change her costume'. In his book, The Clean & Lean Diet, Duigan also recommends a whole range of butt-boosting exercises including squats, lunges, and jumps. Huntington-Whiteley met James several years ago and is such a fan that she penned the introduction to his book Clean & Lean: Flat Tummy Fast. Said Rosie: 'James knows exactly how I want my body to look: lean, taut and strong, yet soft, curvy and feminine. 'What I've learnt through working with James is that by focussing on creating a healthy body you can really achieve all of these things, faster than I ever thought possible. Oh and by the way, nobody can get a stomach as flat as James can!' Although . it's loved by supermodels, Victoria's Secret girls and film stars, Duigan says that the real magic is . that is can work for anyone, from housewives to office workers and . everyone in between. Common sense: James Duigan's Clean & Lean plan is loved by supermodels and anyone who wants to detox and tone up . The . diet has never been advertised, but those who follow it (and who follow . Duigan's workouts, which he teaches from his London gym Bodyism, . recently voted as best in the business by Tatler) become enthusiastic to the point of . fanaticism, making the Clean & Lean plan popular through word of . mouth alone. It recommends fresh food, as close to . its natural state as possible. No refined sugar, which Duigan describes as like a 'toxic fat . bomb' for your waistline. Cut back caffeine to one cup of coffee in the . morning. Rely on . natural, nutritious foods to give you energy rather than a rollercoaster . of unnatural highs provided by sugar and caffeine that invariably end . in a crash that will have you reaching for the next stimulant, whether . that be coffee, carbs, sweets or wine. And yes, ditch the booze. Fans: Left, supermodel Rosie Huntington-Whiteley . has been following the Clean & Lean plan for some years now, while . right, British model David Gandy is also a fan . In his new book, Duigan explains that he came up with the term 'clean and lean' to describe the 'ultimate approach to achieving the perfect body. The word 'clean' here means a body that can deal  effectively with toxins - one that can deal with few that sneak in (via a glass of wine or a chocolate bar) and flush them out successfully.' In his years of studying nutrition, says Duigan, he has discovered that while you can live off processed low-fat food and diet colas for a while your body will be so toxic that you'll find it hard to keep the weight off. 'People come to me who have tried every single diet out there, yet they can't stay slim for long. They cut carbs, they count calories, they ban whole food groups and they spend their lives weighing and measuring out food,' he says. 'But this type of dieting is a complete waste of time: it might help you to drop a dress size or tighten your belt for a while, but you'll gain it back eventually because your body will still be toxic and it's unsustainable - who wants to live like this? And so the cycle of dieting, feeling miserable and deprived, losing and gaining weight continues.' Instead, Duigan says we should enjoy our food, but make sure that rather than processed foods, we eat healthy, natural foods and avoid ones laden with sugar. Download The Clean & Lean Diet on amazon.co.uk for £5.99. Or for U.S. readers at $9.56 on amazon.com . Clean foods are those that: . James says: . 'Sugar is designed to hook us in. It comes in the forms of pretty pink cupcakes, fluffy marshmallows, light sponge cakes with jam in the middle and creamy chocolate. It looks and smells delicious. But in reality, there's almost nothing to love about refined sugar. It makes us put on weight, increases the size of our liver (a bad thing), makes us unwell and ages us inside and out, leaving us tired, fat and wrinkled. 'As well as being highly addictive, refined sugar drags valuable nutrients out of our body, and it's the number one reason why, for the first time in history, children of this generation are predicted to die younger than their parents. WHY SUGAR IS PHYSICALLY ADDICTIVE . Sugar has a similar effect on the brain to pain-killing drugs like morphine and opther opiates (such as heroin). These drugs produce an almost instant feeling of pleasure, calm and satisfaction, making them incredibly addictive. When the food manufacturers figured this out, they began producing foods full of sugar. Back in the 1950s, sugar would mainly be found in homemade cakes, but now it's pumped into almost all of the processed foods, alcoholic and soft drinks and even so-called 'healthy foods' (such as breakfast cereals) and foods aimed at children. Many of us turn to something sugary for 'energy' - and technically, it is a form of energy. But it's a bad type. So yes, you will get a qcuik burst after eating a chocolate bar, but about ten minutes after that you'll feel even more tired than you were before. That's because sugar quickly hits the bloodstream, creating a rapid rise in blood sugar (a 'spike'). But, just as quickly, you then crash (due to insulin being produced from the pancreas), leaving you exhausted. A far better way of getting energy is to eat complex carbohydrates (low-GI fruits, berries), clean & lean proteins, vegetables, drink plenty of water and exercise regularly. If you do all these things, you won't need to rely on something as toxic as sugar to keep you energised. WHY SUGAR IS EMOTIONALLY ADDICTIVE . For most of us, when we were growing up, sugary foods were used as a 'reward' by our parents, grandparents and almost everybody else we knew as children. Is it any wonder that by the time we reached our teens we'd learnt to associate sugary foods with happy times and making ourselves feel better? Serves 4 . INGREDIENTS . 2 tomatoes, halved . 1 broccoli, cut into florets . 4 fresh organic eggs . Parmesan, for sprinkling . rocket, to serve . METHOD . 1. Heat the grill to high and place the tomatoes under it for a few minutes until coloured. 2. While the tomatoes are cooking, steam the broccoli for 3-4 minutes under just tender, then set aside. 3. Meanwhile, bring a pan of water to the boil. Stir the water rapidly to create a whirlpool and crack the first egg into the centre; the swirling water should bring the egg together. Repeat with the remaining eggs (3-4 minutes is sufficient cooking time). 4. Serve each egg with the broccoli and grilled tomato. Grate a little Parmesan over the top, and scatter rocket over the plate.","Exclusive video for Femail readers shows how to tone your derriere .

"Officials evicted several people from the opening match of the cricket World Cup at Hagley Oval on Saturday after they were suspected of being involved in illicit gambling. The people were all evicted for the practice known as 'courtsiding', New Zealand Police said in a statement. Courtsiding involves people at a game relaying information via smartphones or mobile communications devices to gambling syndicates to take advantage of broadcasting time delays. New Zealand won their opening game of the cricket World Cup by 98 runs against Sri Lanka . Corey Anderson blasted 75 off of only 46 balls as the co-hosts begun the tournament with a victory . The practice is different from match-fixing, which was made illegal under New Zealand's Crimes Act last year, where a pre-determined outcome has been assured. Local media had reported witnessing several people being escorted out of the ground in Christchurch and police later said they had been in breach of the ticketing regulations under suspicion of the practice. 'We know what to look for,' the New Zealand Police's officer in charge of the World Cup, Superintendent Sandy Manderson said in a statement. 'We're aware that people are attempting to operate at venues and they will be detected, evicted and trespassed from all venues.' A streaker enters the field of play during the 2015 Cricket World Cup opener in Christchurch . New Zealand beat Sri Lanka by 98 runs in the game, which was largely incident free, though two naked men, known as 'streakers' in New Zealand and Australia, had stormed the field in the final moments of the event. Both were brought down by security staff before they got close to any of the players and were escorted out of the venue.","New Zealand won the opening World Cup game against Sri Lanka .

"We all know that strong pelvic floor muscles can help with bladder problems and child birth but how far would you go to strengthen yours? One woman has created a video tutorial on how to build muscle in your nether region. Her preferred method? Lifting weights. Sex coach Kim Anami has curated Ten Reasons To Lift Weights With Your Vagina in which she outlines the positive effects of her bizarre activity. Bizarre: A sex coach has unveiled a new tutorial entitled 'Ten reasons to light weights with your vagina' 'Think of it like your bicep,' she begins. 'You don't work out your arms just by flexing your muscles; you need weights. The vagina works the same way, it needs weight to create resistance in order to build strength.' Her next reason for vagina weight lifting is that it will help you orgasm 'like never before'. She explains that, according to studies, a strong pelvic floor has been directly linked to the intensity and frequency of a woman's orgasm. Another one of her reasons is that the trick will help enhance your libido and make sex 'ten thousand times better.' And, according to Anami, it isn't just the woman who'll benefit. She goes on to explain that with your new found vaginal muscles you'll be able to 'please your man like never before'. Too far? The video, which claims you can become a world record holder, shows a woman lifting logs with her nether regions . Is your man misbehaving? Fret not. According to Anami you can discipline him with your 'new skill.' 'No need to send your man to the dog house when he's been bad,' she says. 'With your new secret weapon, he's sure to be a good boy.' Anami also says you could become a world record holder - just like Tatyana . Kozhevnikova, a Russian gymnast who can lift a 14kg kettleball with her private parts and officially has the world's strongest vagina.

Liberation master: Kim Anami, who has a son, is a sex coach and even runs retreats . Writing on her website, the mother-of-one says: 'I’ve always been highly attuned to my own sexual energy and spiritual curiosity. From a young age, I had already experienced the power of sex to awaken, transform and accelerate my journey of self-actualization. 'By 22, I was practicing Tantra. I spent nearly a decade living off-grid, from pirate boats off the coast of Vancouver to the wet, sultry jungles of Indonesia. It was there - caressed by the warm air, like an omnipresent lover - that I shed my pseudo-self, and came into my life purpose.'

A spokeswoman for the WA Department of Fisheries said a white shark has been caught near Wylie Bay, at Kelpids Beach, about six kilometres from Esperance . All beaches were closed at Wylie Bay and are likely to remain closed for the next few days . South Bunbury Football Club wrote a post on Facebook a few hours after the incident on Thursday afternoon . A spokeswoman for the WA Department of Fisheries said the first white shark was caught near Wylie Bay, at Kelpids Beach, about six kilometres from Esperance. 'Department of Fisheries' officers deployed capture gear within the vicinity of the incident, and later captured a while shark, between 3 and 4.5 metres in size,' she said. The spokeswoman said the department has not yet confirmed whether the sharks are responsible for the attack, however it has been killed and retained for examination. 'The Commonwealth granted an exemption for the deployment of fishing gear to catch a shark posing a threat,' she said. 'Arrangements will be made to retain the shark for research purposes and for further examination by the department's experts.' A second large white shark, about three metres in length, has also been caught and killed. 'Even upon examination it may not be possible to confirm that either shark was involved in the incident this morning,' the spokeswoman said. All beaches were closed at Wylie Bay and are likely to remain closed for the next few days, the spokeswoman said. '(The department) urges local people and holiday makers to stay out of the water,' she said. Premier Colin Barnett's initial response to the attack was saying a shark being in the area during school holidays posed a significant threat to public safety. He said because it was an unpatrolled beach, his government's newly scrapped drumline policy would not have been applicable. 'That said, today's attack is an unfortunate and tragic reminder of how serious the threat is,' Mr Barnett said. In recent weeks, Surf Lifesaving WA has tweeted reports of shark sightings near Wylie Bay. A white shark was spotted 50m offshore on September 20 around 5pm. And on September 21, a four metre shark was seen at West Beach Dalyup, near Esperance, about 11am. Great Whites are common to the Western Australia coastline, which has witnessed a spate of attacks, some of them fatal, in recent years. Survivor: Greg Pickering, an abalone diver, was attacked by a great white around 180km east of Esperance last year . Victim: Chris Boyd (right) was killed by a shark on the state's south coast November 2013. Boyd (left), 35, was surfing off Gracetown at the time of the attack. Shark cull: This tiger shark was caught in the Margaret River region, WA, as part of the state government's controversial 'catch and kill' program in February. Surfer Chris Boyd, 35, was killed in the waters off Gracetown, on the state's south coast, in November last year. In January 2006, bodysurfer Zak Golebiowski lost a leg when when he was savaged by a great white at Whyton Beach, 60km away from where today's attack occurred. Last October, abalone diver Greg Pickering was attacked by a great white shark while swimming off a remote beach around 180km east of Esperance. Mr Pickering survived bites to the head and neck but required more than 10 hours of surgery. The Barnett Government recently introduced a controversial 'shark-culling' program following the attacks. The program involves baited drum lines being suspended from floating oil drums in an effort to distract sharks from beaches. Catch: A male tiger shark is slaughtered at Moses Rock, off the West Australian coast.","Surfer Sean Pollard suffers serious injuries in shark attack .

"Yesterday morning, I jumped on the scales after a six-mile run and was elated to see that I weigh 9 st 13 lb, the first time I've seen the figure '9' gracing the electronic scales for some considerable time. At 29, I'm 4st 7lb lighter than I was eight months ago and have shrunk from a dress size 18 to a ten... sometimes even an eight. My legs, once so chunky I couldn't squeeze them into a pair of wellies, are slim and toned, and my flabby arms are now lithe. Standing at 5 ft 5 in tall, I have a curvaceous waist where several spare tyres used to sit. Scroll down for video . Then and now: Sarah with Matt when they first appeared in the Mail in June, left, and now she's lost 4st 7lb after reading what he really though about her figure . The sluggish feeling that came with being fat has been replaced by a renewed vigour and vitality that I didn't know existed. And my husband Matt, who's 32 and an area manager for a car valeting company, thinks I'm the most gorgeous creature on the planet. Many people might say Matt is a lucky man. Others might argue he's lucky to be alive. Because I haven't been on a faddy diet or joined a slimming club to ditch the weight. My new slender figure is the result of some tough love from Matt when he told me through the pages of Femail magazine that I was fat and needed to shape up. Hurtful? Absolutely. But effective? Most definitely. For there is nothing like the fear of realising the man you love sees you as an unattractive, whining self-pitying lump to shake you into action. Oh yes, I'd raged and wept over Matt's 'hurtful' words, and even slung a few words of my own back in spite and anger, but now I can see it was the greatest gift of love he's ever given me. Because Matt's searing honesty succeeded where countless diets have failed. And I'd advise any husband, unhappy with his loved one turning to blubber, to take his wife to one side and tell her to take her weight in hand. And to all those women who blame their burgeoning weight on 'big bones' and 'low self-esteem', I urge them to take heed from my story. Take a long look in a mirror. If you were a man, would you find that woman attractive? Then why should the husband who married a size 12 goddess be forced to pretend he still thinks you're gorgeous? On their wedding day: Sarah is glad her husband was honest about her weight gain as 'why should the husband who married a size 12 goddess be forced to pretend he still thinks you're gorgeous?' Niceness and understanding have never worked with me. Matt told me (along with thousands of Mail readers) what I needed to hear, and what every fat woman needs to hear. Out of respect to him, and my marriage, I listened. When we appeared in the Mail in June, we braced ourselves. And the furore it triggered was huge, with men and women divided over whether such brutal honesty was ever justified within a marriage. There were men who believed Matt must have a 'death wish' for uttering the truth, and women declaring they'd have slapped him and that it was him I should shed, not the excess weight. Some even accused me of a lack of solidarity with the sisterhood for heeding his words. But there were also countless messages of support from readers who recognised that Matt's comments were borne out of his concern for my health and happiness, and our relationship. Of course, initially I was furious with him when he blurted out his appraisal of my body after a shopping trip to Cambridge. Empty-handed because I couldn't find any clothes to fit, I was having one of my regular strops about being fat, never expecting Matt would agree with me this time. Bearing in mind he'd been listening to me moan for the previous five years as I went from a size 12 to a size 18, it's hardly surprising that he finally let rip. I raged at him for being cruel and insensitive and it was tempting to storm off to the nearest patisserie to spite him. But Matt stood firm and was determined to be heard. 'You moan all the time about being fat. It's made you miserable, and it's making me miserable, so why don't you stop moaning and do something about it?!' Revelation: Sarah has learnt how healthy eating and exercise can transform her health and she now runs regularly (picture posed by model) Once I'd calmed down, I had to concede that Matt was simply pointing out what was staring me in the (fat) face. My bum did look big in everything I put on, I was seriously overweight at almost 15 st, my self-esteem had withered. Our sex life had also waned because I didn't like him seeing or touching my body. A week earlier, we'd been going out for dinner with friends and as I slung on a baggy t-shirt and eschewed make-up, Matt had said to me, sadly: 'You never make an effort to dress up like you used to.' Although I'd never doubted Matt's love for me and had always ignored his words, as I looked in the mirror, I felt vulnerable. I couldn't take the risk of his head one day being turned by someone slimmer and happier than me. I'd previously lost 2 st with WeightWatchers, then piled it all back on. And a no-carb diet left me ravenous. I would also indulge in three or four glasses of wine a night at weekends, adding up to a whopping 2,400 calories, the equivalent of an extra day's food! The answer to tackling my weight problem emerged a few weeks later when we visited friends who were getting married and in their best shape ever. They were using a computer app which provides reams of advice about healthy eating and allows you to calculate the calories you consume and burn through exercise. I downloaded the app onto my phone and we went for a walk to put it to the test. When I entered my activity into the app later, I was amazed to see I'd burned 400 calories. It was a revelation and I began power-walking as often as I could, even during lunch breaks from my job as practice manager at a firm of architects. I started weighing out cereal for breakfast so that it was a 40 g portion as recommended on the packet, rather than a bowlful that would feed four people - another tip from the app. A normal adult will use up 400 calories running an 11-and-a-half minute mile or 444 calories cycling a 14 to 16-minute mile . For lunch, I switched to healthy sandwich fillings such as chicken or tuna, and snacked on plain popcorn, fruit and yogurt. In the evenings, I swapped pasta and rice for sweet potatoes, bulgar wheat and couscous. And I ditched wine for gin and slimline tonic, which contains fewer than 100 calories per glass. A stone fell off in under five weeks and I started running, too - a few miles at first, but now I run six miles, four or five times a week. By the time we were photographed for the Mail in June, I'd lost 2 st and dared to wear a fitted dress to Matt's brother's wedding. Other guests complimented me on my weight loss and confidence. Seeing my photo in the Mail and the reader comments spurred me on further. By the first week in October, I'd lost 4 st and have lost another 7 lb since. Far from sitting back and smugly eating chips and chocolate, Matt joined me in my quest and has now lost almost 3 st himself — the difference is that I never thought of him as fat and he never complained about his body. In my head, I'm still the fat girl I was back in February. Research has shown that when you lose weight, your mind takes longer to catch up. But the evidence is there in the form of a whole new wardrobe of size 10 clothes, including bikinis for a holiday in Oman. There's nobody more complimentary about my transformation than Matt. Last Friday night I dashed in from work and was about to get changed to go out when he hugged me and declared: 'You look gorgeous just as you are!' And our sex life is utterly revitalised. So, if you're tempted to knock Matt's honesty, please don't, because it's had a magical effect on my figure, health and happiness. But for his harsh words, I'd have been bursting out of size 18 clothes by now, and poor Matt would have been running for the door.","Sarah Watts, 29, and her husband Matt appeared in Femail in June .

"Petrified and starving, a desperate orangutan clings defiantly to the last tree standing in her forest  before it is completely destroyed and turned into a palm oil plantation. Minutes later, the majestic creature is stunned by an anesthetic gun and falls into a net, taken away by rescuers. She was one of several orangutans saved from probable death in Borneo due to the deforestation which threatens their existence. Scared and alone: An orangutan clings to the last tree in her forest after it was devastated by bulldozers. She was rescued along with a number of other orangutans . Brink of death: The animal is stunned and it falls into a net, before immediately being drip-fed nutrients. Many of the orangutans were found starving . Captured: Another orangutan lies in a net after being rescued. Many had resorted to eating bark as their habitat was systematically destroyed ahead of being turned into a palm oil plantation . Rescue: Weak from hunger, another orangutan is saved by rescuers in Borneo . Among those rescued were a pregnant female and a mother and baby who refused to let go of each other during their ordeal. Rescuers from UK charity International Animal Rescue (IAR) and the local forestry department in Ketapang, West Kalimantan, moved in to save the creatures. The frightened animals were desperately searching for food and had even resorted to eating bark from the trees they were trying to hide in. One female orangutan was heavily pregnant, while another, who was still lactating, is thought to have had her baby snatched to be sold as a pet or killed before the rescue team arrived. The final female was found with her scared baby clinging to her back and both were very thin from malnutrition. On the brink: Another orangutan clings to a branch before being shot by a stun gun and saved by International Animal Rescue . Big business: Huge swathes of rainforest in Borneo are being destroyed for palm oil, which is used in processed foods and is increasingly being utilised as a bio fuel . Rescue mission: A man prepares to stun an orangutan to allow it to be taken to a nearby rescue sanctuary . All are now recovering and have since been released into a new area of forest but IAR is now urging a halt to any further land clearing because it is believed that there are other orangutans still trapped. Karmele Llano Sanchez of IAR Indonesia said: 'We were appalled at the condition of these orangutans. 'All of them had gone through long periods of starvation before we rescued them. 'The area where they were found was too small to provide them with sufficient food because the company had cleared most of the forest. 'One of the orangutans had lost her baby, which was probably killed before the rescue team arrived. Weak: An orangutan is attended to by vets after being stunned. While this animal is expected to make a full recovery, many have died as a result of the deforestation . Hope: Another animal is rescued. Their desperate situation appalled International Animal Rescue, which condemned the palm oil companies for their treatment of the orangutans . 'More orangutans could die if this company does not take immediate action.' 'It is heartbreaking to see the state of these animals. 'They are weak from hunger and an increasingly desperate search for food. 'The only positive note is that, on this occasion, rather than chasing them away or killing them, the palm oil company did the right thing and contacted us so we could move them to a place of safety.' Palm oil is an ingredient found in up to half of processed foods, and is also increasingly being used as a biofuel in petrol tanks and power stations. The expansion of oil palm plantations into high conservation value forests is recognised as a leading threat to critically endangered species including orangutans, elephants and tigers.","Heartwrenching scenes as frightened animals lose habitat in Borneo .

"Many celebrities, including Will Young, have claimed to have a porn addiction but a clinical psychologist claims there is no evidence to suggest such an addiction exists . From Will Young to David Duchovny, many celebrities have claimed to have a porn addiction. But new research has revealed there is no strong evidence that such an addiction actually exists. Dr David Ley, a clinical psychologist, and Executive Director of New Mexico Solutions, a large behavioural health programme, has reviewed research into pornography addiction. He found only 37 per cent of research articles about excessive use of porn describe it as an addiction. He also discovered that just 27 per cent of articles on the subject contain actual data. As a result, he concluded that experiments carried out into the topic have been poorly designed and lacked the rigour to provide any proof. Consequently, he concluded that very little, if any, actual evidence had been found to suggest the addiction exists. He noted that pornography addition was also not included in the latest version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders because of a lack of scientific data. This manual is published by the American Psychiatric Association and is seen as the 'bible' of mental health disorders. Dr Ley also discovered there is no evidence to suggest there are negative side effects of excessive porn viewing. He said there was no sign that it was linked to erectile dysfunction or that it changes the brains of users. Instead, Dr Ley says it can actually improve attitudes towards sexuality, increase quality of life and increase pleasure in long-term relationships. He added that it provides a legal outlet for illegal sexual desires and that its use has been associated with a decrease in sexual offences, especially child molestation. The research also showed that people . who claim to have a porn addiction are usually male, not heterosexual . and have a high libido. They also often have religious values that conflict with their sexual desires. X-Files star David Duchovny has famously battled a porn addiction. But new research has found there is no evidence to suggest there are side effects of excessive porn viewing . ‘We need better methods to help people who struggle with the high frequency use of visual sexual stimuli, without pathologising them or their use thereof,’ wrote Dr Ley. ‘Rather than helping patients who may struggle to control viewing images of a sexual nature, the “porn addiction” concept instead seems to feed an industry with secondary gain from the acceptance of the idea.' While Dr Ley is sceptical about the existence of porn addictions, many celebrities have claimed to have one. Will Young told Style that he couldn't stop himself looking at x-rated videos online. He told the magazine: 'It never moved into sex addiction. For me, it was love addiction and fantasy. I was probably addicted to porn.' In 2011 Cameron Diaz also told Jimmy Kimmel Live that she 'loves porn'.","Dr David Ley says only 37% of research articles about excessive porn use describe it as an addiction and just 27% contain actual scientific data .

"A dog abandoned in a cardboard box by the side of the road has been described as the ‘thinnest dog ever seen alive’ by the RSPCA after being starved for two months. The Staffordshire cross, believed to be around two years old, weighed just 17.6lb - half the healthy weight for her breed - and was too weak to swallow any food or drink when she was found. The animal, handed into an RSPCA centre in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, by a man who didn't give his name was named ‘Hope’ by staff and had to be bound in bubble wrap just to keep her alive. How could they! The Staffordshire cross looks in a pitiful state as RSPCA staff feed her with a drip . She spent several days on a drip and is now able to hold her head up and has slowly started eating and drinking. Vet Anna Parry said: ‘I have spent eight years working at an RSPCA clinic in the past so I am no stranger to abused and neglected animals but this is the thinnest dog I have ever seen alive. ‘She weighs just 8kg and a healthy weight for her would be more like 16. ‘When she first arrived we had to wrap her in blankets and bubble wrap just to keep her warm as she could not maintain her temperate and although she is now off the drip and much more responsive she still has a long way to go.’ Sickening: Bones stick out of the body of Hope, who weighs just half the weight that she should . Hope, believed to be aged between one and two years old, was found in a cardboard box in a lay-by near a burger van at the side of the A370 near Hewish, Somerset, on May 16. Spokeswoman Jo Barr said: ‘Hope was in a really bad condition and the vets didn't think she would make it though the first night. ‘She must have been starved for months to be in that condition. She would have only had a few hours left to live if she wasn't handed in. ‘She had to be picked up everywhere, she wasn't able to walk or stand at all. She was in a collapsed state. ‘Hope can now stand but only for a short amount of time.’ RSPCA inspector John Norman is investigating and has appealed for information on the dog. He . said: ‘This poor creature was found in a terrible state, and it would . seem that whoever allowed her to get like this simply tried to get rid . of the problem by abandoning her as though she was rubbish. ‘I would urge anyone with information about this dog to contact the RSPCA cruelty and information line so we can find whoever is responsible and ensure there are no other animals in their possession in need of help.’ Under the Animal Welfare Act 2006 anyone found guilty of causing unnecessary suffering to an animal can face up to six months in prison and/or a £20,000 fine. When Hope is well enough, she will be transferred to the RSPCA North Somerset Branch Brent Knoll Animal Centre.","Staffordshire cross named Hope by staff weighed just HALF what she should .

"New president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, pictured, is facing calls to resign . Jean-Claude Juncker yesterday faced calls to resign following damaging claims he helped some of the world’s largest companies avoid paying billions of euros in tax when he was prime minister of Luxembourg. Leaked documents showed how hundreds of sweetheart deals with more than 300 companies including Heinz, Burberry, Dyson and Ikea were signed while the newly appointed European Commission President was in charge. Mr Juncker faces growing anger across Europe because of claims other countries missed out on billions of euros in tax revenues while Luxembourg became one of the world’s richest because of the arrangements. Critics have argued his position is untenable as the Commission, which he now heads, is investigating the tax practices he oversaw during 18 years as the Grand Duchy’s prime minister. It has been claimed that companies used Luxembourg ‘like a magical fairyland’ with webs of internal loans and interest payments to slash tax bills. The firms’ divisions in Luxembourg lent money to their operations in other countries. The interest payments made on these loans reduced the profits in these countries. In some cases it was claimed companies enjoyed tax rates of less than 1 per cent on profits moved into the Grand Duchy. Tory MP Stewart Jackson called for Mr Juncker to resign. He said: ‘His position is untenable. The issue of corporate tax avoidance has been high on the UK agenda because of Amazon, Google and Starbucks. The sweet heart deals of countries such as Luxembourg sit at odds with a Commission President who says that he supports widespread economic and financial reform.’ Scroll down for video . Patrick O’Flynn, Ukip’s economics spokesman, said: ‘The EU actually facilitates tax avoidance by enabling multinational corporations to channel earnings through whichever member state they want. ‘Luxembourg was happy to do dirty dealings with the big corporations to maximise its revenues at the cost of tens of billions of pounds that should have ended up in the UK public realm. ‘Juncker has lots of questions to answer. It’s why multinationals are so keen on EU membership but why it is not in the UK’s interest.’ Some of the world's largest firms including top British companies like Dyson are using a Luxembourg tax avoidance scheme to get out of paying billions of pounds . Margaret Hodge, chair of the Commons public accounts committee, said Mr Juncker had ‘presided over the biggest exploitation of European nations in his own little country for decades’. The Labour MP, who has been one of the fiercest critics of tax avoidance by companies such as Starbucks, Google and Amazon, said: ‘I think he should come clean and talk about it, certainly try to explain it. How can we know he’s working in the interest of Europe when as prime minister in Luxembourg he has exploited populations in every European country and elsewhere for decades?’ The respected Bloomberg news agency accused Mr Juncker of ‘making his country rich by picking the pockets of other countries he is now mandated to serve’ in an editorial column. ‘He could best serve the European project by resigning,’ it said. ‘Juncker’s position as the head of the body investigating the tax practices he oversaw as prime minister is a clear conflict of interest.’ In France, Marine Le Pen, leader of the National Front party and Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, of the Arise the Republic party, also called for Mr Juncker to resign. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker (pictured) presided over Luxembourg while many of the tax avoidance schemes were operating . Left-wing MEPs have asked that Mr Juncker is hauled before the European Parliament to explain his role. Mr Juncker has not appeared in public since the documents were published last week and pulled out of one appearance. A spokesman yesterday said: ‘Mr Juncker will choose the moment himself to say what he has to say.’ The European Commission is already investigating Luxembourg’s tax practices with a review of Amazon, and said it could widen this inquiry in the light of new evidence. Before the leaked papers were revealed Mr Juncker said he felt no conflict of interest and would not interfere with the probe by the Commission’s competition department.","Leaked documents showed sweetheart deals with more than 300 companies .

"On this day in 1912, the Titanic set sail from Southampton on its fateful voyage to New York. Just five days into its journey, the ocean liner plunged into the depths of the ocean taking with it the lives of over 1,500 crew and passengers. Over the years, scientists have attempted to explain how this magnificent ship met such a tragic demise. Claims the Titanic faced a higher than normal number of icebergs in its fateful voyage have been disputed by academics at Sheffield University . One of the most popular theories suggests the Titanic was ‘unlucky’ because it set sail in a year with an exceptionally high number of icebergs. But researchers from the University of Sheffield have attempted to dispel this as a myth and claim the risk is much greater today. ‘We have seen that 1912 was a year of raised iceberg hazard, but not exceptionally so in the long term,’ said Professor Grant Bigg, who led the research. ‘1909 recorded a slightly higher number of icebergs and more recently the risk has been much greater - between 1991 and 2000 eight of the ten years recorded more than 700 icebergs and five exceeded the 1912 total.’ The White Star Liner RMS Titanic, built by Harland & Wolff in Belfast, 4th February 1912, aided by four tugs preparing to leave for Southampton for her maiden voyage to New York on April 10th 1912 . After crashing into an iceberg, the ship that was described as 'unsinkable' went under in just two and a half hours leaving 1,517 people dead and only 700 survivors. Its wreck is pictured here . Some researchers have argued that the iceberg responsible for the demise of the Titanic was sent on its deadly path by the closest approach of the moon to the Earth in 1,400 years. Texas State University researchers claimed in 2012 that a once-in-a-lifetime lunar event created a super-high tide on January 12, 1912. The tide dislodged icebergs from shallow waters off the coasts of Labrador and Newfoundland, filling shipping lanes with icebergs. The ice field in the area the Titanic sank was so thick with icebergs responding rescue ships were forced to slow down. But researchers from the University of Sheffield have now attempted to dispel this as a myth and claimed the risk is much greater now. He warned that as use of the Arctic increases in the future with the declining sea-ice the ice hazard will increase in water not previously used for shipping. The team conducting the research used data on iceberg locations collected as far back as 1913. The iceberg which sank the Titanic was spotted just before midnight on 14 April 1912 and was 1,640ft (500m) away. After crashing into it, the ship that was described as ‘unsinkable’ went under in just two and a half hours leaving 1,517 people dead and only 700 survivors. Previously researchers had argued that the iceberg responsible for the demise of the Titanic was sent on its deadly path by the closest approach of the moon to the Earth in 1,400 years. Texas State University researchers claimed a once-in-a-lifetime lunar event created a super-high tide on January 12, 1912 - setting loose a deadly fleet of icebergs, three months prior to the event. Normally, icebergs remain in place and cannot resume moving southward until they’ve melted enough to refloat or a high enough tide frees them. The icebergs from the North Atlantic originate mainly from the western coasts of Greenland and the region is the most important origin of icebergs on the northern hemisphere still today. The iceberg which sank the Titanic was spotted just before midnight on 14 April 1912 and was 1,640ft (500m) away. Pictured is one possible path taken by the iceberg that sank Titanic over 100 years ago . The White Star passenger liner sailed on its fatal maiden voyage to New . York 102 years ago today . Between 1991 and 2000 eight of the ten years recorded more than 700 icebergs and five exceeded the 1912 total. Scientists claim the risk of hitting an iceberg is significant, despite the advent of technology to help captains prevent a collision. While there are no globally-collated figures for iceberg strikes, they happen every year. The shrinking of the Arctic sea ice created the possibility for increased commercial travel as well as more shipping routes. Natural resources are also causing ships to spend more time in the iceberg-infested waters around Greenland and the Arctic. Each year thousands of pieces break off from the front of the glaciers but only the largest will one or three years later reach the North Atlantic. Currents then push it along the coast of Greenland southwards towards the Canadian coast where off the coast of Newfoundland the iceberg gets captured by the ‘warm’ Gulf Stream and pushed in south-western direction. However, only one per cent of all icebergs reach such southern latitudes. The Titanic only had visual sightings and a shipboard radio to guide it through iceberg-infested waters. Today, captains rely on data from real-time satellite imagery provided by missions such as the European Space Agency's Polar View. But the risk of hitting an iceberg is still very real and while there areno globally-collated figures for iceberg strikes, they happen every year. Photograph showing the iceberg which sank the Titanic. The Titanic only had visual sightings and a shipboard radio to guide it through iceberg-infested waters . The iceberg which sank the Titanic was spotted just before midnight on April 14, 1912 but despite quick action to slow the ship it wasn¿t enough and the ship sank in just two and a half hours . For the northern hemisphere, from 1980 to 2005, there were 57 incidents involving icebergs giving a rate of 2.3 per year, according to Brian Hill, of the Institute for Ocean Technology. The shrinking of the Arctic sea ice created the possibility for increased commercial travel as well as more shipping routes. Natural resources are also causing ships to spend more time in the iceberg-infested waters around Greenland and the Arctic. ‘As polar ice sheets are increasingly losing mass as well, the iceberg risk is likely to increase in the future, rather than decline,’ said Professor Bigg. Charles Lightoller . The most senior officer of the Titanic to survive the ship's sinking downplayed the cause of the disaster as a 'small low-lying iceberg' in an insurance claim form which has come up for sale. In the unique document, second officer Charles Lightoller wrote that the ship made a 'slight jar' before starting to go down. He also tried to excuse the behaviour of staff who failed to spot the iceberg, denying that they were guilty of 'negligence' or being insufficiently vigilant. Lightoller's insurance claim is believed to have been an attempt to minimise the responsibility of the ship's owner, White Star Line, in order to secure the full payout of $5 million (£3 million). The historic document detailing his account of the disaster is being sold at auction by Henry Aldridge and Sons of Devizes, Wiltshire, with a pre-sale estimate of £12,000 . In the testimony made to Robinson Leech, the notary public for New York, on April 19, Lightoller explained that 'all went well' until 11.45pm on April 14 when the ship struck an iceberg. He stated: 'The captain was on and off the bridge throughout the watch. A sharp lookout was kept from the crow's nest. 'The ship was on course South 86 degrees West true when the lookouts reported ice dead ahead. 'The first officer immediately starboarded the helm reversed the engines full speed and closed all watertight doors. 'The ship swung to port but struck a 'growler' or small low-lying iceberg with the bluff of her starboard bow, making a comparatively slight jar with a grinding sound.' He went to explain that 'all hands were called on deck' and the lifeboats were filled with women and children.","Popular theory suggests the Titanic was ‘unlucky’ because it set sail at a time when lunar activity increased the threat of icebergs .

"Brave: The photograph of John Tulloch's bloodied and bandaged face became one of the defining images of the 2005 London bombings . A survivor of the July 7 terror attacks whose courage was praised by Prince Charles faces deportation from Britain. The photograph of John Tulloch’s bloodied and bandaged face became one of the defining images of the 2005 London bombings. After visiting him in hospital, the Prince of Wales said he exemplified the ‘resilience of the British people’. But the academic is now facing expulsion from this country – despite being born to British parents in a British colony, marrying a British woman and having two British sons. The 70-year-old university lecturer has had his passport confiscated and fears he will be forced to leave the country where he has lived and worked for most of his life. Describing the situation as an ‘insult’ to his forebears, he said: ‘This is harder than 7/7 and it hurts me far more than that day has ever done. I am about to be thrown out of the country. ‘There I was, hailed as an example of British courage, British pluck and British spirit, an iconic image of British resistance ... then I get kicked out.’ Professor Tulloch was sitting opposite July 7 ringleader Mohammed Sidique Khan when the suicide bomber detonated his explosives on a Tube train. The image of the dazed lecturer emerging from Edgware Road station, his face burned and his clothes shredded from the force of the explosion, was beamed around the world. He suffered serious injuries to his ear drums and still has post-traumatic stress disorder from his experiences.

His father was a major in the Gurkha Rifles and was fighting in Burma at the time of his birth and his grandfather and great-grandfather both worked for the British government in India. He said: ‘I am totally gobsmacked by this. My family served Britain for three generations. I’ve been banging my head against a wall trying to get this sorted out. It’s like Kafka. I look back now, on the verge of being thrown out of residence in the UK, at something like 120 years of my family’s distinguished service to Britain in India. This isn’t simply an insult to me, but to generations of my family.’ Professor Tulloch’s case  compares with those of at  least 11 foreign-born terrorists who have been excused deportation after serving prison sentences on the grounds that their human rights would be at risk. AUK Border Agency spokesman said: ‘It is the responsibility of an individual to check that they will not lose a previously acquired nationality or citizenship on acquiring an additional one.’","The photograph of John Tulloch’s bloodied and bandaged face became one of the defining images of the 2005 London bombings .

"Next year, Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic is expected to begin taking paying customers to space for around £150,000 ($250,000) a ticket. But if you can't afford that, one company has a cheaper alternative - World View Enterprises is offering balloon flights to the ‘edge of space’ for £45,000 ($75,000). Beginning in 2016, the Arizona-based company will take paying customers in a pressurised capsule to a height of 19 miles (30 kilometres) - and it has just set a world record to prove the system works. Scroll down for video . World View, a commercial balloon spaceflight company, has successfully completed a scaled test flight of its high-altitude balloon spaceflight system (illustration shown), breaking the world record for highest parafoil flight in the process, which will carry the Voyager capsule 19 miles (30 kilometres) high . On 18 June World View launched a parafoil from Roswell International Air Center in New Mexico on a flight that lasted five hours, breaking the altitude world record for such a flight in the process. The Voyager capsule will launch from a site in New Mexico. It sits in a launch cradle, where passengers and crew can climb inside. A high-tech balloon then inflates with helium and then lifts off. In one-and-a-half to two hours the capsule ascends to just over 19 miles (30 kilometres), atop ’99 per cent of Earth’s atmosphere’ according to World View. Here, for two hours the capsule will float, letting passengers view out the window, get a drink from the bar and share pictures on social media with on-board internet. Helium is then vented from the balloon before the parafoil, called the ParaWing, releases from the balloon. This then glides the capsule back to the ground. The Voyagers can then be taken back to the launch site, which may be as much as 300 miles (480 kilometres) away, for another flight. The total flight time is five to six hours. The test validated the full flight profile of the spaceflight system, lifting a model of the eventual system scaled down to ten per cent to 120,000 feet (36,000 metres) and back down to 50,000 feet (15,000 metres). The parafoil was successfully executed, breaking the world record. This allowed for further validation of the precision guided landing system of the space vehicle. In 2016 the parafoil, together with a high-altitude balloon, will be used to take pressurised capsules known as ‘Voyagers’ on trips to the edge of space. This will give six passengers, along with two crew members, two hours of 'cruising' during which they will be free to stroll around the ‘luxury’ capsule - which even has a bar and internet access. While passengers will not experience any weightlessness on the flight like Virgin Galactic, the trip will be significantly longer than the latter's six minute projected flight time. For the money-conscious, that means a minute of observing the curvature of Earth from World View's Voyager capsule will cost £370 ($625). Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo, meanwhile, sets you back £1,650 ($2,800) a minute. Beginning in 2016, the Arizona-based company will take paying customers in a pressurised capsule to a height of 19 miles (30 kilometres).

Of course, the flight of the Voyager doesn't reach the official boundary of space, which stands at 62 miles (100 kilometres), but it will still enable passengers to see Earth fall away beneath them. Upon completion of the flight, the parafoil detaches from the high-altitude balloon and glides the capsule back safely to a landing on Earth. According to the company, the capsule will also give ‘unprecedented and affordable access to the near-space environment’ for educators, researchers, private companies and government agencies. ‘We couldn't be any more excited about the results from this test flight,’ said Jane Poynter, CEO  of World View. ‘It represents a foundational achievement that moves us one step closer to offering a life-changing experience to our Voyagers.’ The test flight represented the maiden voyage of World View's Tycho vehicle, a reusable commercial craft that enables research opportunities in fields including communications, surveillance, remote sensing and first response. This will give six passengers, along with two crewmembers, two hours of 'cruising' during which they will be free to stroll around the 'luxury' capsule (illustration shown), which even has a bar and internet access.

"Frigid winter weather dumped huge amounts of snow on parts of the Midwest and transformed summer breezes into gusts far below freezing in a matter of hours is headed for the East Coast. A huge front of cold air that has swamped Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan with intense and dangerous flurries of snow pushed south overnight, freezing places as far south as Oklahoma and Texas. And by Thursday, the system will have reached New England and the Atlantic seaboard, where it could send temperatures plunging by 15 to 20 degrees. By the weekend freezing temperatures could reach as far south as Atlanta, Georgia. Swamped: Ishpeming in Michigan, pictured above by Twitter user Raquel Musselman, was hit by 36 inches of snow - the most in the country . Coping: A hardy Ishpeming resident, left, clears a path to the street while, right, cars remain buried by the extreme snowfall . Frozen: A couple in Bozeman, Montana, brave the cold to walk their dogs after snows hit the region. Bozeman has reported temperatures of -6 degrees . Snowfall: Wisconsin, upper Michigan and Minnesota were buried in snow, . According to the National Weather Service, snow could spread as far as Ohio, West Virginia, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and upstate New York - though New York City will not be hit. Wednesday morning the worst-hit states were still dealing with the huge volumes of snow which fell in the three-day storm. In Ishpeming, on Michigan's upper peninsula, 36.1 inches of snow has fallen since Sunday, with more to come thanks to its proximity to Lake Superior. Many roads were snow-covered and slippery Wednesday morning in the Upper Peninsula, where residents are accustomed to snowy conditions. Meteorologist Justin Titus said that on his way to work roads were 'just rutted out and kind of felt like you were driving over a washboard.' Advancing chill: The cold, which pushed south Tuesday, will move further east by the weekend . Chills: Over night temperatures will plunge well below zero in the worst-affected areas, such as Rapid City, South Dakota . Chilly: Cold temperatures turned melting snow into icicles on rooftops in Montana thanks to the frigid air . Braving the weather: A cyclist braves the morning commute down a snowy track in Bozeman on Tuesday . Other parts of northern Michigan had almost as much snow. Cambridge, Minnesota, was hit with 16.5 inches, though snow has now stopped falling there. Minneapolis and St Paul were also badly hit. Minnesota's State Patrol reported some 500 road accidents - two of which were fatal - in the wake of the snowfall. Many students stayed home from school due to the weather, though more than ever they were able to take classes over the internet rather than miss a day. Flurries also hit Colorado, Idaho, Montana and the Dakotas, accompanied in some points by extremes of cold. This morning Casper, Wyoming, reported temperatures of -22 degrees. Accidents: Hundreds of road crashes were reported in the icy conditions - pictured above is a Colorado State Police officer investigating a crash outside Colorado Springs . In Billings, Montana, where temperatures fell from the high 60s into the single digits on Tuesday, Patsy Kimmel said she was warned about the weather before arriving from Oklahoma to celebrate her 70th birthday with family. 'Yesterday I was wearing sandals and a short-sleeve shirt, and today I'm wearing a coat and scarf and turtleneck and sweatshirt and gloves,' she said. In the Texas Panhandle, temperatures plunged from 70 degrees into the teens overnight. Oklahoma City went from a high of 80 degrees Monday to a low of 30 Tuesday morning. In the Dakotas, wind chills made it feel like 20 below in some places. That was good news for Action Mechanical Inc. of Rapid City, South Dakota, a heating and ventilation business that was doing booming trade. 'Bang! We get this arctic blast, and it just opens the floodgates,' said John Hammond Jr., a department head. 'We're behind right now as we're sitting here talking.' Respect: Snow fell on war graves in Colorado Springs on Veterans Day Tuesday . The epicenter of the phenomenon is the remnants of Typhoon Nuri, which is causing areas of exceptionally low pressure over the Bering Sea, between Russia and Alaska. This has bent the jet stream, a barrier of wind which usually keeps hot and cold air separate, pulling warm air north and pushing cold air south. The pattern of pressures forms a bulge that resembles the Greek letter omega (Ω), and is therefore referred to as an Omega Block. Phenomenon: The weather system is being driven by the remains of Typhoon Nuri (above in purple), which is sitting west of Alaska, sucking up warm air and forcing cold air down into the mainland United States . Cold air which would usually sits near Canada has been pulled down as far as Texas, while warmer air from around the United States sails north. As the front approached, temperatures in Texas, Oklahoma and Missouri plunged from the 70s into the teens in a matter of hours. In Colorado, a huge dust storm accompanied the advancing front, and was pictured from above by an airplane passenger. The same phenomenon is warming up Alaska, with the result that, later this week, even the north of the region could be warmer than Dallas.","Cold weather system which has blanketed upper Midwest is on the move .

"Billion-dollar movie franchises encourage production companies to cut lengthy books into multiple movies, but a new study reveals that such plot breaks drag the plot on much longer than it should. By taking the length of the movies in film series like Harry Potter and The Hunger Games and then dividing it by the number of words in the original books, movies can then be compared by how much theoretical action takes place in each second of the film.  The worst offender turned out to be film version of The Hobbit, where the studio decided to split the lengthy book into three movies. Blogger Mark Lee used his analysis method on OverThinkingIt to show that in doing so, there were only 3.12 words in the book for every second of each film. Drawn out: The Hobbit (pictured) had the least amount of words per second based on the length of the original book, showing that it may not have needed to be split into three different films . Low numbers: The three Hobbit films (though two are still yet to come out) have far fewer words than each of The Lord of The Rings movies . Setting the precedent: The Lord of the Rings films had far more words per second, largely because each film was based off a single movie and not broken into multiple films . Since the second and third instalments have not been released, he used the length of the first film, titled The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, as a guidepost and divided the number of words in the book version- a whopping 95,022- by three. The 3.12 words per second statistic means little until it is compared to that of the three films made as counter points to the three books in the series. The Fellowship of the Rings had 16.59 words per second, The Two Towers had 13.36 per second and The Return of the King had 11.15. 'In a strictly quantitative sense, the three Hobbit movies are laughably lacking in density of source material presented on screen compared to the three Lord of the Rings movies,' Mr Lee wrote in his article on Over Thinking It. Breaking down Breaking Dawn: The final Twilight book was split into two films, but they both had a relatively high number of words per minute, which was only slightly less than the films based around one full book . From shelf to screen: Movie studios find it profitable to drag series on for more movies than simply the number of books written on the subject . Even if The Hobbit was made as one film rather than three, the word cound would still be lower than its the Lord of the Rings iterations, with a hypothetical 9.36 words per second. A breakdown of the word count isn't the only way to tell that the first Hobbit film felt long, as many moviegoers complained about the slow pace and how it felt as if it was purposefully stretched out to make the next to films exciting. 'There's no denying the majesty in Peter Jackson's visuals but he's taken a relatively slim children's book and stretched it beyond the limits,' film critic Richard Roeper said. Similar to the start: The split finale of Harry Potter had more words than the first two films . Wordsmith: The Harry Potter film series spanned a decade and had a massive following . The Hobbit's sparse dialogue is highlighted even more dramatically when other books that are split into two or more films. The final Harry Potter book 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows' was broken into two films, he first of which had 11.31 words per second and the second which had 12.71. In a surprising twist, the final Twilight installment- the writing for which was roundly panned- had nearly triple the number of words per second than the expected breakdown for the two-part Hunger Games finale. Hit maker: The Hunger Game series is the latest situation where a popular book series has turned into cinema gold . Hit maker: The Hunger Game series is the latest situation where a popular book series has turned into cinema gold . While 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay' has not yet been made, Mr Lee subbed in the standard 120-minute movie length to make his calculations. 'I still think this is an interesting way to examine these book-based franchises and how they adapt source material for different media and business needs,' Mr Lee wrote in his article.","Final books in popular series are often broken into more than one movie, as seen with Harry Potter, Twilight and The Hunger Games .
A new study shows that the decision to do so is largely because studios want to make as much as possible by stretching out the series .
In some cases- like The Hobbit, where one book will be turned into three movies- that means that there are very few words per second of film ."

"A New Hampshire teen who was kidnapped in October 2013 waited until a week after she was home to reveal her alleged captor's identity, according to court papers released Wednesday. The documents also said Abigail Hernandez told investigators she learned her captor's name from a cookbook he had handed her during her captivity. The information was released by a judge Wednesday in response to a motion filed by The Associated Press to unseal the arrest warrant affidavit against Nathaniel Kibby. Kibby was charged in July with kidnapping the then-14-year-old on Oct. 9, 2013, as she walked home from her high school in Conway. She returned home the night of July 20, but investigators have not revealed the details of her kidnapping and return. Scroll down for video . Charged: Nathaniel Kibby (seen in this July 2014 file photo) was charged in July with kidnapping then-14-year-old Abigail Hernandez . Victim: Abigail Hernandez, pictured, was reportedly kidnapped while walking home from her high school in October 2013 (file photo) The paperwork released Wednesday was heavily redacted, with about half the text in the five-page document whited out. The newly released material sheds no light on how Abby vanished or how she returned home. Nor does it address any trauma she may have suffered. Lawyers hired by Abby's family said in August she suffered 'numerous acts of unspeakable violence' during her months of captivity. The lawyers' statement was largely a plea for privacy and did not elaborate on what she endured. Kibby's lawyer, public defender Jesse Friedman, declined to comment Wednesday on the newly released information. Senior Assistant Attorney General Jane Young declined to elaborate on the material released Wednesday. The court papers revealed that in the week after Abby's return, she made a sketch of the man she said held her captive. Sometime during that week, the teen's mother, Zenya Hernanadez, told investigators that her daughter 'had confided in her, telling her that she did not provide law enforcement with all the necessary information and furthermore, knew who her captor was.' On July 27, Zenya Hernandez gave a detective Kibby's name. Kibby is charged with kidnapping but has yet to be indicted or have a hearing on the evidence against him (file photo) Suffering: Lawyers hired by Abby's family said in August she suffered 'numerous acts of unspeakable violence' during her months of captivity (file photo) After Kibby's arrest, investigators spent considerable time searching a large storage container behind his Gorham trailer. They have refused to comment on whether they believe Abby was held captive there during her nine-month disappearance. The excerpts indicate prosecutors believe she spent at least part of her disappearance inside Kibby's trailer. She told prosecutors she remembers seeing a framed copy of the Declaration of Independence on Kibby's wall. According to the excerpts, a state trooper who'd made several trips to Kibby's home before Abby's disappearance recalled a framed government document inside the residence. Throughout the portions of the affidavit released Wednesday, investigators use the term 'captor' in reference to Kibby and 'captive' to describe Abby's circumstance. Mystery: The newly released material sheds no light on how Abby vanished or how she returned home, nor does it address any trauma she may have suffered . Held: Nathaniel Kibby is being held on a $1 million cash bond . Abby and her mother attended Kibby's arraignment in July but have not commented on the case. Zenya Hernanadez had told investigators she doesn't believe her daughter made it home the day she vanished because her dogs had not been let out and nothing seemed to be moved. The excerpts say a dog tracked Abby's scent from the high school to her front door, but it is not clear whether her scent was fresh or may have lingered from previous trips. The AP filed its motion to unseal on Oct. 2. Kibby's lawyers did not object but prosecutors did, saying the information would impede the ongoing investigation and could 'taint the testimony' of witnesses who have yet to be interviewed. Judge Pamela Albee met with prosecutors and defense attorney Jesse Friedman behind closed doors Nov. 7 but did not hold a public hearing on the motion to unseal. Kibby is charged with kidnapping but has yet to be indicted or have a hearing on the evidence against him. Several probable cause hearings have been postponed with the consent of his lawyers.

"Foreign workers employed by arts and craft chain Hobbycraft have been told to speak English or face the sack. Staff at the supplier's distribution warehouse in Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, were hauled in for a meeting this week . after difficulties arose with different nationalities conversing only in . their native tongue. Staff were told the firm’s policy was they should only use English during work hours and, if caught doing otherwise, they could be disciplined. Staff at the Hobbycraft warehouse in Burton (pictured) were told they could face disciplinary action if they didn't speak English at work . A Hobbycraft director said the move was to 'create a good working environment . Chris Fenlon, people director for Hobbycraft, said: 'Having the ability to speak English is part of the recruitment criteria in our distribution centre, however within the social areas colleagues can speak all languages . 'Therefore, we do ask that during working hours in the warehouse colleagues speak English. 'This is to create a good working environment where all colleagues can communicate effectively. But one Polish worker, who asked not to be named for fear of repercussions, said that she thought the move was 'silly'. She said: 'Our managers forbid us from speaking to others in any language but English. Hobbycraft currently has 79 art and craft stores across the UK, he first store opened in Dorset in 1995 . 'The first few months were not that bad and, if they spotted someone using any other language, the person would basically get told off. 'But then all staff were called to the canteen to be told that we were only allowed to speak English while working and, if we do not, we will face punishment. I know it sounds silly but I think it is something that is important and needs raising.' However, the move could land bosses in hot water as Slater & Gordon law firm warns the policy could be indirectly discriminatory and could lead to compensation claims. Claire Dawson, employment lawyer at the firm, said: ‘There would certainly be a potential claim for indirect racial discrimination. ‘Although this policy is going to apply to all staff obviously it will put staff who are not native English speakers at a disadvantage compared to those who are. ‘It would be natural for workers of the same nationality to speak to each other in the same language. ‘Where there are health and safety reasons requiring people to give clear instructions I can absolutely see there would be potential justification but to impose a blanket ban I think would be difficult to justify.’ Hobbycraft currently has 79 art and craft stores across the UK, he first store opened in Dorset in 1995.","Workers at Hobbycraft warehouse in Burton ordered to only speak English .

"Kevin Davies is certainly known as one of the most robust and dogged strikers to grace the Premier League and it seems this hasn’t worn off playing for his current side Preston. The League One club led big-spending Manchester United until a late second-half comeback in a 3-1 FA Cup fifth-round defeat at Deepdale on Monday night.

The 37-year-old was his usual determined self and having received treatment on the touchline, quickly returned to action with his hand bandaged up.

"Click here to view all the stats and graphics from Newcastle's win over Liverpool using our fantastic match zone service . There was a punch of the air, a handshake with Brendan Rodgers then a cursory acknowledgement of the fans in the Milburn Stand before Alan Pardew scurried down the tunnel. Hurrying for sanctuary is something Pardew has had to do a lot of in recent months, as Newcastle supporters aimed their venom at him, enraged by the erratic performances and confidence-sapping results of his team. On this occasion Pardew should have hung around. As acclaim rang around St James Park after a doughty win over Liverpool, secured by Ayoze Perez, Newcastle’s manager would have appreciated he is no longer public enemy No 1. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Brendan Rodgers: Moussa Sissoko should have been sent off . Ayoze Perez shows a poacher's instinct to prod past Simon Mignolet to punish Alberto Moreno's (right) dithering in the penalty area . Newcastle celebrate after Ayoze's goal inflicted Liverpool's fourth Premier League defeat  in ten games - they lost six last season . Remy Cabella hops on Ayoze's back in front of the adoring fans as Newcastle take the lead against a lethargic Liverpool . Daryl Janmaat showed Mario Balotelli no mercy with this eye-watering tackle which resulted in a yellow card for the Dutchman . Janmaat looks unrepentent as Balotelli flips in the air and hits the ground with a crunch after the Toon man's strong challenge . Balotelli winces in agony after being knocked for six. The incident seemed to sum up another frustrating afternoon for the Italian striker . Newcastle: Krul 6.5, Janmaat 7.5, Steven Taylor 7.5, Coloccini 7, Dummett 7, Abeid 6.5, Colback 6.5, Obertan 6 (Aarons 27, 6), Sissoko 8.5, Ameobi 6 (Cabella 66, 6.5), Cisse 5.5 (Perez 46, 7). Subs not used: Ryan Taylor, Gouffran, Haidara, Elliot. Booked: Taylor, Sissoko, Janmaat, Coback. Goal: Ayoze 73. Liverpool: Mignolet 5, Johnson 5.5, Skrtel 6, Lovren 5.5, Moreno 5, Sterling 5, Allen 5 (Borini 66, 6), Gerrard 6, Henderson 5.5, Coutinho 6 (Lambert 80), Balotelli 5.5. Subs not used: Brad Jones, Toure, Manquillo, Lallana, Can. Booked: Skrtel, Henderson, Lovren. Man of the match: Sissoko. Attendance: 52,166. Referee: Andre Marriner. Proof of that was all around. In the East Stand, some fans unfurled a banner reading ‘backpardew.com’ while before kick-off, a lone supporter, dressed as the Grim Reaper, held a placard proclaiming ‘Pardew – Back from the Dead’. ‘It is Halloween,’ said Pardew with a wry smile. ‘Bobby Robson had some dark days here, don’t worry about that. If you are Newcastle manager, it is not all gin and tonics and aperitifs. There will be rough days. I kept saying that we have good spirit and good talent. ‘I’m not saying I saw the wins coming but I knew there was talent. Our fans are brilliant. It will be fantastic in the town tonight. I might even go in myself — the first time for a while. That is what this city is about. It loves football. ‘When it does not go well they let you know and when it is going well, they let you know. You take the good with the bad.’ And, at this moment, it is good. That goal from Perez ensured a week that began with a victory at White Hart Lane, followed by a win over Manchester City in the Capital One Cup, ended as it started. Newcastle have momentum and Pardew knows it. But what of Liverpool? Their campaign of false starts shows no signs of turning and if Rodgers was looking for a jolt of confidence before Tuesday’s daunting trip to Madrid, he was left bitterly disappointed. The problems he has are no closer to being solved. ‘I didn’t think we deserved to lose but didn’t do enough to win it,’ he observed. ‘We had enough of the ball but just lacked that bit of creativity and invention in the final third. But we made a mistake and that has unfortunately cost us the game. That is the biggest disappointment.’ This is the highest-scoring contest in the history of the Premier League but you would never have guessed that following a turgid opening 45 minutes. A spark was missing from both sides and their respective movement was, at best, pedestrian.

Obertan was taken off on a stretcher in the 25th minute with his injury causing an early headache for boss Alan Pardew . On the touchline, in their technical areas, Pardew and Rodgers fidgeted with frustration as moves broke down following sloppy passes or lacked the wit to cause problems. Of the two, Rodgers was more unhappy, turning to his assistant regularly to express his impatience. Rodgers was almost tearing his hair out in the 37th minute when Newcastle had the first big chance. Had they scored, it would again have been down to defensive deficiencies, as goalkeeper Simon Mignolet came for a corner and got nowhere near it, presenting a chance to Papiss Cisse. Liverpool had a reprieve, though, as Glen Johnson was in the right place to cover Mignolet and headed Cisse’s tame shot off the line and away from danger. Aside from a couple of half-hearted penalty shouts, that was as good as it got for Newcastle before the break. Sissoko was all over the shop - CLICK HERE for more stats from our Match Zone .

In the 40th minute, a typically precise corner from Steven Gerrard found Martin Skrtel but, having escaped Steven Taylor’s attentions, he planted his header the wrong side of a post. MINS PLD    KM    MILES . Newcastle                                 113.4   70.5 . Mark Noble                  90            12.2     7.6 . Jack Colback               90            11.9     7.4 .

Steven Gerrard            90            11.1      6.9 . Alberto Moreno            90            10.8      6.7 . An advantage at that stage would not have been merited but, belatedly, Liverpool emerged with more intent after the restart and twice in the opening five minutes Mario Balotelli made Tim Krul work, first with a free-kick, then with a curling shot. Once Balotelli got involved, Liverpool looked slightly more efficient but, as has been the case so often this season, they could not sustain their good play for a prolonged spell and when they began to lose direction, Newcastle sensed an opportunity. With the home crowd turning up the noise, Newcastle began to press and in the 71st minute, they were rewarded. At the heart of it was the imperious Sissoko — who, Rodgers said, should have been sent off for a foul on Joe Allen — driving into Liverpool’s penalty area, spreading panic on the way. Sissoko looked to free Remy Cabella but as Alberto Moreno tried to stab away the danger, he succeeded only in turning the ball into Perez’s path and he gleefully swept his opportunity beyond the helpless Mignolet. One goal should have become two in the next attack as Newcastle sped forward after Liverpool lost possession. Perez and Cabella ended up in a position where they up against Johnson but Mignolet kept Liverpool in the game, saving with his feet when Cabella seemed certain to score. His miss did not matter. Liverpool lacked the gumption to stage a grandstand finish and, ultimately, Newcastle saw the contest out comfortably and the celebrations were typically noisy. Pardew, however, chose to enjoy the moment on his own. ‘I would like to think I am coming out of this a better manager,’ said Pardew. ‘It has been interesting and educational. ‘It tests you, this football club, on a number of levels.

"Louis van Gaal and his Manchester United players set off for London on Saturday as they prepare to face West Ham United at Upton Park. Van Gaal's side will be looking to make it three Premier League wins in a row when they take on Sam Allardyce's injury ravished side on Sunday. Allardyce is expected to give a debut to 16-year-old defender Reece Oxford with Carl Jenkinson, James Tomkins, Winston Reid and James Collins all doubts for the match. Radamel Falcao, Marcos Rojo and Victor Valdes arrive to catch the train for London ahead of Sunday's game . Louis van Gaal gives his arms as rest as he prepares for the journey to the capital . The injury crisis could leave Robin van Persie and Radamel Falcao licking their lips but Dutchman Van Gaal admits he is still a long way off being satisfied with his side's progress. Van Gaal has overseen an improvement in United's Barclays Premier League situation this term with the team, after last season's seventh-placed finish, currently on course for a top-four spot. They also still have a realistic shot at silverware in the FA Cup, having reached the fifth round this week. But, as their initial struggles against Cambridge indicated - the League Two side having taken them to a fourth-round replay - United are still to truly convince under the Dutchman. The former Holland, Barcelona and Bayern Munich coach accepts he still has much to do to restore the club to their former glory. Wayne Rooney and Ryan Giggs arrive at the station with their hands full on Saturday afternoon . Angel di Maria arrives at the station with his bodyguard ahead of the journey to London . He said: 'I am only satisfied at the end of the season - to be third and in the next round doesn't count now. 'We are on our way but we have to play a lot of matches still and there are still three to go to the final. That is our goal. We have to wait and see if we reach that goal.' United have lost just once in their last 16 games in all competitions and travel to West Ham on Sunday buoyed by comfortable victories over Leicester and Cambridge in the past week. Van Gaal wants to maintain the momentum but is preparing for a difficult afternoon at Upton Park against a West Ham side that have been among the front-runners this season. Falcao and Rojo meet fans while sitting in a Range Rover Sport at the train station . Phil Jones clutches a man bag as midfielder Juan Mata works a Manchester United Gilet . The 63-year-old said: 'I said at the beginning of the week, before the game against Leicester, that this shall be an important week that we had to win all the three matches. 'We beat Leicester to go third, after that we beat Cambridge, so we are in the next round of the FA Cup. Now we have to continue. All the players know that is true. 'But it is not so easy. We have to play away against West Ham. It was a tough game in Manchester. It shall not be easy but we want to continue and if we want that we have to win in London.' Some of United's performances have been disjointed. The efficiency of their defence and Van Gaal's tactics have been a running issue while their formidable-looking attack has not fully fired in recent weeks. Van Gaal recognises the faults but believes when United do get it right, their play should rank alongside the best. It's all smiles for Marouane Fellaini and Adnan Januzaj as they carry their bags and suits to the awaiting train . He said: 'It is not a question of playing with wingers or without wingers, with three defenders or four. It is the play style that is attractive. 'Okay, until now we could have played better in ball possession - we have had unnecessary losses in ball possession and we have to improve that. 'But I think we have a very good defensive organisation and also a very good attacking organisation. We are fourth in the scoring goals league and also third or fourth in the defensive way of playing. 'I don't think we are very bad - we are very good - but we can improve. 'We have to improve a lot in my opinion, but at the end maybe we can see we are the best team.' Midfielder Michael Carrick remains United's only fitness concern for Sunday with a calf injury.

"Injured flyhalf Dan Carter did enough to prove his fitness to New Zealand coach Steve Hansen and win a berth in the All Blacks squad for the northern hemisphere tour. Carter, one of three flyhalves in the 34-man squad named on Monday, replaces Colin Slade, who kicked the game-winning conversion against Australia on Saturday. Carter will go on tour for tests against the United States, England, Scotland and Wales despite having barely played this year and still trying to overcome the effects of a broken leg sustained in the Super Rugby final in August. Dan Carter has been included in the New Zealand tour squad, despite breaking his leg in August . Carter, pictured promoting the 2015 Rugby World Cup in London, hopes to play against England on tour . 'He's been training without being able to play because he's had a bit of nerve damage to the leg he broke,' Hansen told Fairfax Media in Christchurch. 'He's getting better and better all the time and he's extremely confident of being able to play. 'He knows his body better than anybody and if he's confident, I'm confident.' While Hansen said Carter was confident of getting through unscathed, Slade's conversion of Malaki Fekitoa's 80th minute try that clinched a 29-28 victory over the Wallabies may not be his last act on the rugby field this year. 'We've spoken to Sladey about the DC situation,' Hansen added. 'We'll monitor DC this week and get an idea of where he's likely to be. Carter (right) broke his leg in the Super Rugby Final in August, and has not played much this season . Carter (left) is now back in training, and both he and coach Steve Hansen are hopeful he will be fit . 'If DC can't make this trip because of his leg then Colin Slade will come back in.' Carter's inclusion despite having barely played this year suggests he remains firmly in Hansen's 2015 World Cup plans despite a horrendous run of injuries since the 2011 tournament. Widely considered the best flyhalf in world rugby, he is likely to be the starting pivot in England next year with Aaron Cruden and Beauden Barrett, who shared the starting role this season while Carter was on a six-month sabbatical then recovering from injury, in the backup roles. Cruden was supplanted by Barrett as the starter for the latter part of the Rugby Championship after he was late for the team's assembly time for their flight to Argentina following a boozy night out and left at home by Hansen. The 25-year-old Cruden was brought back into the squad for the third Bledisloe Cup match in Brisbane but not named in the matchday team with Barrett given the nod to start and Slade offering more versatility off the bench by being able to cover flyhalf, wing and fullback. Carter charges upfield during a match against Scotland in 2012, one of the teams New Zealand will face . Carter prepares for a penalty kick, playing for his club side Canterbury Crusaders in July 2014 . Code-swapping centre Sonny Bill Williams was included after having played less than a full game of rugby since his return to the 15-man code following two seasons with the Sydney Roosters in Australia's National Rugby League. Williams had a successful stint in union that included a World Cup win with the All Blacks in 2011 and a Super Rugby title with the Waikato Chiefs. However, with only five tests before next year's World Cup, Hansen was keen to have the bullocking player involved as quickly as possible. Lock Luke Romano was a surprise inclusion after breaking his leg in Super Rugby and not playing for five months. Hansen said his selection was to get him up to speed with the team's game plan and allow first-choice pairing Brodie Retallick and Sam Whitelock some down-time on tour. 'Luke hasn't played a lot of rugby due to injury over the last 18 months, so we thought it would be good to get him back into the All Black way,' Hansen added. The All Blacks face the U.S. in Chicago on November 1 before they meet England, Scotland and Wales on successive weekends. Backs: Israel Dagg, Ben Smith, Charles Piutau, Cory Jane, Julian Savea, Malakai Fekitoa, Conrad Smith, Sonny Bill Williams, Ryan Crotty, Dan Carter, Beauden Barrett, Aaron Cruden, Aaron Smith, TJ Perenara, Augustine Pulu. Forwards: Kieran Read, Richie McCaw (captain), Sam Cane, Jerome Kaino, Liam Messam, Victor Vito, Patrick Tuipulotu, Brodie Retallick, Jeremy Thrush, Luke Romano, Sam Whitelock, Ben Franks, Owen Franks, Charlie Faumuina, Joe Moody, Wyatt Crockett, Dane Coles, Keven Mealamu, Nathan Harris.","Dan Carter broke his leg in the Super Rugby final in August .

"A child molester boyfriend is apparently just one of many problems in the life of Mama June Shannon, star of the now-cancelled Here Comes Honey Boo Boo. Estranged husband Mike 'Sugar Bear' Thompson's ex-wife has come forward to claim that Mama June tried to commit suicide in early 2005, while she was pregnant with her youngest child Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' Thompson. Sugar Bear's ex Patricia East told Star magazine that he called her frantically in early 2005, when his then wife took an overdose of pills. Scroll down for video . Shocking: The ex-wife of Mike 'Sugar Bear' Thompson (Sugar Bear pictured left) says Mama June (center) tried to commit suicide in 2005, while she was pregnant with youngest daughter Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' (right) 'Michael Told me, ""Please come over! June is trying to kill herself!""' Patricia told the magazine. 'I wanted to do the right thing, so I went over. She was upset about something and had taken an overdose of Tylenol or Advil. We called Poison Control, and I talked to her to try and keep her awake.' East even claims that she was still married to Sugar Bear when he began an affair with Mama June and that the reality star even suffered a miscarriage before the two officially divorced. Sugar Bear and East met in 2001 on an internet chat room and soon after she moved to Georgia to be with him. But the relationship seemed doomed from the onset, when he caught her with another woman on their first Valentine's Day together.

"A cruise ship which launched from Texas has been barred from entering Belize and Mexico because it may be carrying an Ebola victim. The ship is carrying a health worker from Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas - the epicenter of the Ebola crisis, where the first patient to die of the disease in America was treated. The woman - who is now in voluntary isolation to protect fellow passengers - had handled samples from Thomas Eric Duncan, who died of the virulent disease on October 8. Officials had wanted to move her off the ship so she could fly home. But the governments of Belize and Mexico both denied permission for the ship to dock in order to protect its own citizens. Scroll down for video . A female healthcare worker from Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital is reportedly quarantined on board Carnival Cruise ship Magic (pictured) in the Caribbean over an Ebola scare . Tourists enjoy a ride on a catamaran as cruise ship Carnival Magic is seen near the shores of Cozumel October 17 . The health worker has so far not shown any signs of the disease since she handled the material 19 days ago, the White House said. Ebola's incubation period is two to 21 days. In the wake of the scare on the seas, Texas Health Presbyterian shared news guidelines it had issued limiting staff's travel. From now on workers will not be permitted to board planes, ships or trains for 21 days after entering a room with an infected patient. The New York Post, which reported the memo, said that enhanced monitoring will also be put into place, and staff can volunteer to be taken into care at the hospital if they want. The government is working to return the woman and her husband to the US before the ship, the Carnival Magic, completes its cruise. The State Department was working to secure their transportation home. On board: Passengers on the Carnival Magic, pictured, have been separated from the health worker, who put herself in voluntary isolation . Keeping on: Vacations continued for passengers aboard the ship, who were given a $200 credit to their on-board accounts, but had to miss out on a stop in Mexico . An administration official said the cruise ship had stopped in Belize but officials there would not allow the passenger to leave the vessel so she could be flown home. On Friday morning, passengers aboard the ship learned that they will not be making a planned stop in Cozumel, Mexico, due to 'a situation beyond the cruise ship's control.' The captain of the Carnival vessel made the announcement at around 10am saying that they are being forced to skip the final port on the itinerary and return to Galveston, Texas, Sunday. ‘We greatly regret that this situation, which was completely beyond our control, precluded the ship from making its scheduled visit to Cozumel and the resulting disappointment it has caused our guests,’ the Carnival Cruise line said in a statement to Miami Herald. A Mexican port authority official said the ship was denied clearance to avoid any possible risk from Ebola. 'It is the first time that this has happened, and it was decided the ship should not dock as a preventative measure against Ebola,' Erce Barron, port authority director in Quintana Roo, told Reuters . The company is offering passengers a credit of $200 each to their shipboard account and a 50 per cent discount toward a future trip. Explanation: This note was handed out to passengers explaining how the spat with Belize meant the woman could not be taken off the ship . The ship skipped a planned stop in Cozumel, Mexico, on Friday because of delays getting permission to dock from Mexican authorities over Ebola scare . A government official said that when the Texas lab worker left the US on the cruise ship from Galveston October 12, health officials were requiring only self-monitoring. One official said it's believed the woman poses no risk but health-care authorities want to get her off the cruise ship and back to the US out of an abundance of caution. There have been no restrictions placed on other passengers aboard the ship. Images from aboard the stricken vessel were published by The Denver Channel. Carnival Cruise Lines said in a statement that the woman, a lab supervisor, remained in isolation 'and is not deemed to be a risk to any guests or crew'. 'We are in close contact with the CDC and at this time it has been determined that the appropriate course of action is to simply keep the guest in isolation on board,' the statement said. The worker is being monitored for any signs of infection by the ship's doctor. An administration official said the cruise ship had stopped in Belize, but officials there would not allow the passenger to leave the vessel, which is now on its way back to Texas . The worker did not come into direct contact with Thomas Eric Duncan - the Ebola-infected man who died at the Dallas hospital on October 8. US State Department spokesman Jen Psaki said the worker joined the cruise ship with a companion in Galveston, Texas on October 12. 'The employee has been self-monitoring, including daily temperature checks, since October 6, and has not had a fever or demonstrated any symptoms of illness,' Ms Psaki said. The  cruise ship is carrying more than 4,600 passengers and crew. In a statement about company policy concerning Ebola, Carnival officials wrote: 'None of Carnival Cruise Lines' ships visit the region where Ebola cases are originating nor do our ships call in any countries with Level 3 CDC Travel Heath Notices. 'Any passengers or crew who have visited or traveled through Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea within 21 days of a cruise departure date will be denied boarding.' The Belize government said Washington has asked for assistance evacuating a cruise ship passenger who was considered to be 'a very low risk of Ebola' - but it refused because of the threat of infection. Mr Duncan, 42, was diagnosed with the deadly disease on September 28 after returning from a trip to Liberia. He died from the virus on October 8 . 'While we remain in close contact with US officials we have maintained the position that when even the smallest doubt remains, we will ensure the health and safety of the Belizean people.' The incubation period - the time interval from infection with the virus to onset of symptoms - for Ebola is two to 21 days, according to the World Health Organization. Caribbean countries on the Gulf of Mexico cruise circuit have been among the first to close their borders to travelers from Ebola hotspots, with four nations laying down bans. Jamaica has joined Colombia, Guyana and the Caribbean island of St. Lucia as countries denying entry to travelers who recently visited the Ebola-affected nations. Jamaica's travel ban extends to 'persons ordinarily resident in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone as well as persons who have traveled to or transited through Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, within 28 days of having departed from these countries,' the government said. Two nurses who treated Mr Duncan, 42, have also been diagnosed with Ebola. But both Nina Pham, 26, and Amber Vinson, 29, were in a stable condition after treatment for the deadly virus. The latest statistics from WHO show that the worst-ever Ebola epidemic has already claimed nearly 4,500 lives, with the vast majority of the fatalities in the West African nations of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. The passenger is a healthcare worker at the Texas Presbyterian Hospital where Thomas Duncan died . The deadly virus has also reached Nigeria, Senegal, Spain and the United States but outbreaks have been contained so far. Ebola is spread through close contact with an infected person's bodily fluids, such as blood, sweat, vomit, feces, urine, saliva or semen. Those fluids must have an entry point, like a cut or scrape or someone touching the nose, mouth or eyes with contaminated hands, or being splashed. For this reason healthcare workers wear protective gloves, fully-body suits and masks. WHO says blood, feces and vomit are the most infectious fluids, while the virus is found in saliva mostly once patients are severely ill and the whole live virus has never been culled from sweat. Health workers in protective gear carry the body of a woman suspected to have died from Ebola virus, from a house on the outskirt of Monrovia, Liberia (pictured) earlier this month. The latest statistics from WHO show that the worst-ever Ebola epidemic has already claimed nearly 4,500 lives, the majority in West Africa .","The female passenger works at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, Dallas .

"Hoon drivers are cruising at speeds of up to 250km/hr along a remote stretch of Australian road and gloating about their achievements on social media. The incredibly dangerous acts are being filmed in the Northern Territory by the drivers themselves, centering cameras on the odometer of their vehicles and then uploading them to Facebook to publicly crown their achievement. The dashboard footage has appeared on Facebook, and the men responsible are being investigated by police. In this video, a man who identified himself as 'Fuhrer' according to the NT News, posted an incredibly high-risk photo of himself reaching 210km/hr. The long stretch of the Stuart Highway is an open speed limit but drivers can still be charged for dangerous driving . 'Fuhrer' reached speeds of more than 210km/hr along the stretch of road in Central Australia and posted the video of it on Facebook . The open speed limit route along the Stuart Highway in Central Australia goes for 204km . The one minute video is focused on the odometer of a Toyota Corolla, but was pulled from Facebook's 'NT Performance Cars' page because people expressed outrage over its content. While many brandished it reckless, one man thought it was a platform to out-do his predecessor's top speed and post an image of himself travelling at 40km/hr faster. Andrew Wardo Warden boasted about how he upstaged 'Fuhrer' and uploaded an image of his  dangerous speed, at close to 250km/hr, on the same Facebook page. Police have launched a scathing attack on both drivers and said they are investigating the incidents - which appear to have been taken while travelling along a remote stretch of Australian road known as the Stuart Highway. The highway, which connects South Australia and the Northern Territory, has a 204km/hr open speed limit but police said the open limit doesn't give drivers free rein to travel at dangerously high speeds. Senior Sergeant Garry Smith told the NT News drivers can still be charged with reckless driving within the open speed limit zone, and According to an NT Government website: 'An unrestricted speed limit means you should drive at speeds that would keep yourself and other road users safe at all times.' A second man boasted about how he could upstage the driver and posted an image to NT Performance Cars Facebook page travelling at more than 240km/hr . It states the Government is trialling a one-year open limit on the Stuart Highway, North of Alice Springs to Barwon Creek in central Australia. 'Regardless of the presence or absence of a nominated speed limit, dangerous driving is a serious traffic offence and can put you and other road users at risk,' the website states. 'Fuhrer' who claimed to have been driving a Toyota Corolla gloated about reaching the dangerously high speed, but posted anonymously because he is savvy social media user who wouldn't dare identify himself. In a fiery Facebook rant he told the 'NT Performance Cars' community:  'Obviously I didn’t post with my real name cos (sic) its a video doing something illegal. How f***ing retarded can you c***s get.' Hidden Valley Drag Association president said photographing or filming speeds while driving puts people at risk of 'injury or death to themselves and also innocent bystanders'.","The man known as 'Fuhrer' uploaded the 210km/hr footage to the NT Performance Cars Facebook page .

"The Citizens Commission on Benghazi, a self-selected group of former top military officers, CIA insiders and think-tankers, declared Tuesday in Washington that a seven-month review of the deadly 2012 terrorist attack has determined that it could have been prevented – if the U.S. hadn't been helping to arm al-Qaeda militias throughout Libya a year earlier. 'The United States switched sides in the war on terror with what we did in Libya, knowingly facilitating the provision of weapons to known al-Qaeda militias and figures,' Clare Lopez, a member of the commission and a former CIA officer, told MailOnline. She blamed the Obama administration for tacitly approving the diversion of half of a $1 billion Qatari arms shipment to al-Qaeda-linked militants. 'Remember, these weapons that came into Benghazi were permitted to enter by our armed forces who were blockading the approaches from air and sea,' Lopez claimed. 'They were permitted to come in. ... [They] knew these weapons were coming in, and that was allowed.. 'The . intelligence community was part of that, the Department of State was . part of that, and certainly that means that the top leadership of the . United States, our national security leadership, and potentially . Congress – if they were briefed on this – also knew about this.' The weapons were intended for Gaddafi but allowed by . the U.S. to flow to his Islamist opposition. Scroll down for video . The Citizens Committee on Benghazi released its interim findings on April 22, 2014 in Washington. Pictured are (L-R) Clare Lopez, Admiral (Ret.) Chuck Kubic, Admiral (Ret.) James 'Ace' Lyons, former CIA officer Wayne Simmons and civil rights attorney John Clarke . On September 11, 2012 armed terror-linked militias attacked U.S. diplomatic outposts in Benghazi, Libya, killing four Americans and driving the United States out of that part of the country . 'The White . House and senior Congressional members,' the group wrote in an interim . report released Tuesday, 'deliberately and knowingly pursued a policy . that provided material support to terrorist organizations in order to . topple a ruler [Muammar Gaddafi] who had been working closely with the . West actively to suppress al-Qaeda.' 'Some look at it as treasonous moves,' said Wayne Simmons, a former CIA officer who participated in the commission's research. 'And our men and women had to follow what many purport as, qualify as treasonous moves.' Retired Rear Admiral Chuck Kubic, one of the commission's sources, told reporters Tuesday that those weapons are now 'all in Syria.' 'Gaddafi wasn't a good guy, but he was being marginalized,' Kubic recalled. 'Gaddafi actually offered to abdicate' shortly after the beginning of a 2011 rebellion. 'But the U.S. ignored his calls for a truce,' the commission wrote, ultimately backing the horse that would later help kill a U.S. ambassador. Kubic said that the effort at truce talks fell apart when the White House declined to let the Pentagon pursue it seriously. 'We had a leader who had won the Nobel Peace Prize,' Kubic said, 'but who was unwilling to give peace a chance for 72 hours.' In March 2011, Kubic said, U.S. Army Africa Commander General Carter Ham told NBC News that the U.S. military was not actively targeting Muammar Gaddafi. That, Kubic revealed, was a signal to the Libyan dictator that there was a chance for a deal. Gaddafi responded by 'verifiably ... pull[ing] his forces back from key rebel-held cities such as Benghazi and Misrata.' Christopher Stevens served as the U.S. Ambassador to Libya from June 2012 to September 11, 2012 when he was killed in the attack . Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in January 23 that it mattered little why the Benghazi diplomatic compound was attacked: 'What difference, at this point, does it make?' Gaddafi . wanted only two conditions to step down: permission to keeo fighting . al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), and the lifting of sactions . against him, his family, and those loyal to him. The . Obama administration's unwillingness to help broker a peaceful exit for . the Libyan strongman, 'led to extensive loss of life (including four . Americans)' when al-Qaeda-linked militants attacked U.S. diplomatic . facilities in the city of Benghazi,' the commission told reporters. The White House and the National Security Staff did not immediately respond to questions about the group's findings. 'We don't claim to have all the answers here,' said Roger Aronoff, whose center-right group Accuracy in Media sponsored the group and its work. 'We hope you will, please, pursue this,' he told reporters. 'Check it out. Challenge us.' Retired Admiral Chuck Kubic said the White House refused to let the Pentagon pursue a peaceful exit for Muammar Gaddafi: 'We had a leader who had won the Nobel Peace Prize, but who was unwilling to give peace a chance for 72 hours' The . commission and AIM filed 85 document requests under the Freedom Of . Information Act, hitting the Department of Defense, State Department, . Federal Bureau of Investigation and Central Intelligence Agency with . demand after demand. But . most of its information has come from insiders with deep knowledge of . the flow of weapons in Libya and elsewhere in the African Maghreb. Admiral James 'Ace' Lyons told the group that he believes the raid on the Benghazi compound was intended as a kidnapping exercise, aimed at snatching U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and demanding a prisoner swap for the 'blind sheikh' Omar Abdel-Rahman. Abdel-Rahman is serving a life sentence in federal prison for planning the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center garage in New York City. He also masterminded a plan, later foiled, to blow up the United Nations, both the Lincoln and Holland tunnels, the George Washington Bridge and a federal building where the FBI had a base of operations. A senior FBI source, Lyons said Tuesday, 'told me that was the plan.' The attack, history shows, grew in intensity and resulted in the deaths of Stevens and three other U.S. personnel. Lyons also said U.S. claims that it lacked the resources to mount a counterattack in time to save lives is false. 'I'm going to tell you that's not true,' he said. 'We had a 130-man unit of forces at Sigonella [AFB in Italy]. They were ready to go.' 'The flight time from Sigonella to Benghazi is roughly an hour.' Killed: An image captured by a cellular phone camera shows the arrest of strongman Muammar Gaddafi in Sirte, Libya on October 20, 2011 . Former CIA officer Clare Lopez accused the U.S. government of allowing arms to flow to al-Qaeda militants who opposed Gaddafi in 2011, 'switching sides in the war on terror' Some of the . group's claims strain credibility, including the assertion that the . Obama administration's early effort to blame the Benghazi attack on a . protest against a crude anti-Muslim YouTube video 'appears to have been . well-coordinated with U.S.Muslim Brotherhood organizations as well as . Islamic state members of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).' Those . groups, the commission noted, 'all joined in condemnation of the video, . and, even more troubling, issued calls for restrictions on Americans’ free speech rights.' But Simmons, the former CIA officer, criticized the Obama administration on the familiar refrain of then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton exclaiming in a Senate hearing that it mattered little why the Benghazi facilities were struck. 'They believed they were going to be saved, that they were going to be rescued, but they weren't,' Simmons said of the four Americans who died. 'I know who made the decision, in my heart of hearts, to leave our war fighters there and be blown up. And then to have one of the most powerful politicians in our country sit there and say, ""What difference does it make?"" – should be an alarm bell for all Americans. 'It haunts me,' Simmons said. 'I play that line over, and over, and over, and over in my mind.' The group has called for a Select Congressional Committee to investigate the Benghazi episode. A total of 189 House members have signed on to a bill that would create the committee, which would be bipartisan and have sweeping powers to subpoena the executive branch. House Speaker John Boehner, Lopez said Tuesday, 'he blocked it. One has to wonder if he and Congress have had some sort of briefing on what happened.' Kubic insisted that Congress is unable to break logjams in the Obama administration and find out what happened in the days leading up to and following the Benghazi attack without a new committee. 'If they don't have strong subpoena power, if they don't have the ability to do long-term cross examination, it won't work,' he said.","Citizens Committee on Benghazi claims the US government allowed arms to flow to al-Qaeda-linked militants who opposed Muammar Gaddafi .

"Drawings done by a neglected five-year-old boy who weighed just 8.3kg when he was discovered by police in Adelaide reveal the extent of his trauma. A court heard his mother was 'too busy having sex' to properly care for her son, who almost starved to death in the filthy room he was locked in by his parents for nearly two weeks. The boy, now in foster care, is still struggling to cope after the abuse he suffered and is distressed by normal tasks like drawing, Channel Ten News reported. Scroll down for video . Drawings done by a neglected five-year-old boy in Adelaide show he is struggling to cope with basic tasks . The boy, then four years old,  weighed just 8.3kg when he was discovered by police . He has learning difficulties and has been held back in kindergarten where he gets bullied and called a 'baby' by other children. The boy's 24-year-old mother told police she was preoccupied with her partner and put him before her toddler. The child, then four years old, was only days away from death when he was found naked and crouched on the floor, the Adelaide District Court heard on Tuesday. Police only happened to find the malnourished, dehydrated and shivering boy when his mother called police to the Adelaide home complaining she had been assaulted by the boy's father. He has learning difficulties and has been held back in kindergarten where he gets bullied and called a 'baby' In a handwritten letter penned by boy's father to his mother, he apologised for his abuse . The mother said she has 'messed up'. 'I've done the wrong thing. I know I shouldn't have thought about my man before my son,' she said. 'I didn't associate with my child like I should have, instead I was too busy having sex with (her partner).' The court also heard that the mother had miscarried and earlier pregnancy after she was physically assaulted by the father, who kicked her in the stomach. In a handwritten letter penned by the father to the mother, he apologised for his abuse. Police sift through the squalor of the Adelaide home last year . A court heard his mother was 'too busy having sex' to properly care for her son, who almost starved to death in the filthy room he was locked in by his parents (pictured) for nearly two weeks . The court also heard that the mother had miscarried and earlier pregnancy after she was physically assaulted by the father, who kicked her in the stomach . 'I can’t take any of the s*** I’ve put you threw [sic] back, you have no idea how much I wish I could,' he wrote. ‘The one person who tried to help me (you) has coped [sic] mistreatment, foul language, violence and distance and for all of this I am sorry.’ The court also heard the mother posted pictures to social media of her meals and dishes she had just cooked as her son starved in his bedroom, Channel Nine News reported. While the boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was fed under his locked door and lived in a small room full of soiled nappies, pictures were posted on Facebook of her first attempt at cooking a roast lamb and a melted chocolate dessert. Images of roast lamb and a chocolate dessert posted by the starving boy's mother as he was locked in his bedroom . The Adelaide house was covered in rotten food and litter. Here, the toilet is surrounded by used toilet paper . Prosecutors have called for significant jail sentences after the 28-year-old father and the 24-year-old mother have pleaded guilty to an aggravated charge of endangering the life of their son. The District Court was told the parents had been on a binge of alcohol and cannabis and had fed the boy yoghurt, custard or jelly on plates they slid under the door. Officers had to walk through garbage bags, rotting food, dirty nappies and sanitary pads to get to the boy, who was surrounded by used nappies, plastic plates and his own faecal matter. 'He (was) a whisper of a child and, on the prosecution case, only a couple of days away from certain death if the officers had not intervened,' Ms Boord said. Police had to wade through rubbish when they were called to the home last year to deal with a domestic incident . Cans of energy drink and food wrappers fill the room as investigators wade through the squalor . A victim impact statement, compiled by authorities and the boy's foster parents, said he now hides food in his pockets and has had a significant number of decayed teeth removed. For the first six months he was in care, he refused to leave his bedroom. He's still being toilet-trained, has limited language skills, cries and whimpers in his sleep and normal family outings are obviously new to the boy. He cannot tolerate doors being closed and cannot control his emotions, sometimes punching himself in the head or running into walls. The court was told that when arrested, the mother weighed 38kg and the father 39kg. The boy was locked in his room and fed under his door. He weighed 8.3kg when discovered . Toys and a dirty matress fill the room. Doctors said the boy was just days from death when found . Bags of rubbish fill the bathroom. Police were shocked by the appalling state of the property . The mother's lawyer, Tim Heffernan, said no-one in the household was receiving proper care. There was no routine, no day or night, and his client - who had a terrible upbringing - was subjected to domestic violence. Although she loved her son, 'she was clearly incapable of organising her life or caring for the child'. The man's lawyer, Mark Twiggs, said his client was appalled by his actions and was extremely sorry. Years earlier, Victorian authorities had removed another child from the father's care. The couple will be sentenced on December 11. The four-year-old boy was found in a filthy house which was littered with rubbish and rotting food .

With Here Comes Honey Boo Boo star Mama June continuing to deny that she's had any recent contact with him, convicted child molester Mark McDaniel has been pictured laying low with a mystery woman . McDaniel, 53, was photographed on Wednesday with the gray haired lady at his home in Decatur, Georgia . The unnamed woman, who may be a relative, towered over the ex-con who was only released from jail in March after serving ten years for abusing of June’s oldest daughter Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell, when she was eight. Less than 80 miles away, Mama June was photographed putting on a show of togetherness with her ex Sugar Bear in a desperate bid to save their floundering reality TV careers following the shocking revelations. The couple left the little famous white house in McIntyre, Georgia, with their beloved daughter nine-year-old Alana ‘Honey Boo Boo’ - after which the hit-TV show is named – on Wednesday in the full glare of the media. Unemployed Mike ‘Sugar Bear’ Thompson took the wheel of a top of the range Chevrolet Suburban to drive into nearby Milledgeville, accompanied by an anxious-looking bodyguard.

The entourage stopped at a branch of the SunTrust bank before doing some grocery shopping at Walmart and booking an appointment at a hair salon at the Milledgeville Mall. The family happily signed autographs and posed for photographs with members of the public who stopped them in the street. Mama June and Sugar Bear declined to answer whether they were back together again, following their split earlier this year amid accusations of infidelity. Sugar Bear replied, ‘No comment’, when asked by MailOnline if the couple were back together. Mama June refused to answer the question. United front: Mama June and her ex Sugar bear stepped out together with their daughter Honey Boo Boo in McIntyre, Georgia on Wednesday amid child abuse allegations . Busy day: The entourage stopped at a branch of the SunTrust bank before doing some grocery shopping at Walmart and booking an appointment at a hair salon at the Milledgeville Mall . Everyone has an opinion: One on-looker said: ‘It’s interesting that they are walking around together after all that bad stuff about Mama June's dating sex offenders’ Staying mum: Sugar Bear replied, ‘No comment’, when asked by MailOnline if the couple were back together. Mama June refused to answer the question . However skeptics have claimed the outing was more to do with the cancellation of the latest TV series than true love. One onlooker said: ‘It’s interesting that they are walking around together after all that bad stuff about Mama June's dating sex offenders.’ The couple are rumored to have earned more than $20,000 for each episode. TV executives at TLC cancelled the next series of the hit series Here Comes Honey Boo Boo last month following revelations that Mama June was dating a convicted sex offender. Running errands: The trio were seen leaving a bank, flanked by bodyguards for protection . Costume shopping? The family were seen exiting WalMart, with Mama June pushing a trolley which appeared to contain Halloween items . What scandal? The trio wore big grins, perhaps hoping to put on a happy front amid the scandal . Earlier on Wednesday the TV star insisted that her children are her top priority despite damning evidence that she has allowed them to be in contact with the man who molested her own daughter. However in video obtained by MailOnline, Mama June maintained that she had not recently spoken to McDaniel. She said: 'The protection of my kids is my number one priority.

She added: 'I have to think about my family, my kids, I have a lot of things to think about,' she said on the video. 'My kids are my number one priority.' Her comments come just days after she posted an unapologetic video to Facebook insisting that reports of her having a relationship with McDaniel were false. Dutiful daughter: Honey Boo Boo pushed the empty shopping cart back to the store as the family prepared to leave . 'The statement of me dating a sex offender is totally untrue,' she said. 'I would not ever, ever, ever, ever put my kids in danger.' But photographs have emerged showing evidence to the contrary, including an image of them together in bed. Another photograph reveals Mama June sitting on a staircase with daughter Honey Boo Boo behind her. McDaniel sits behind the child, with his hand on her shoulder. Big day of shopping: The trio were seen leaving a Bath And Body Works at twilight . Staying close: Mama June and Sugar Bear walked together to their car . No bad blood? Sugar Bear even put a protective hand on June's back during the outing . Despite Mama June's protests, TLC announced they are cancelling the series over how she has allowed contact between McDaniel and her children. The concerns come just months after McDaniel was released from his 10-year prison sentence for aggravated child molestation. A sickening police report from 2003 shows how, after revealing the abuse to her elementary school teacher, Anna told the officer that McDaniel molested her in June's bedroom while she was at work. Leading the way: Honey Boo Boo walked a few steps ahead of her parents, smiling for the camera . She told authorities that she had done the 'S word' with  McDaniel, the report published by RadarOnline revealed. Anna also told police that her mother's boyfriend touched her inappropriately, made her touch him inappropriately and forced her to perform a sex act on him. When she told him to stop, he would not, the report claims. McDaniel abused Anna multiple times between April and October 2002 but the youngster took months to speak out because McDaniel had threatened to kill her if she told, RadarOnline reported. Keeping up appearances: The family happily signed autographs and posed for photographs with members of the public who stopped them in the street . Star style: June showed off her freshly styled hair after a visit to the hair salon . 'Anna stated that Mark told her not to tell because he would not like her anymore,' the police report said. 'Anna advised she got tired of holding it in and had to tell.' Speaking to the National Enquirer in 2012, Anna's ex-boyfriend added: 'Anna told me that McDaniel threatened that if she ever told her grandparents what happened to her, he’d kill them and her. According to Spalding County Superior Court documents obtained by RadarOnline, Anna's younger sister Lauryn - then just three - was beside her in the bed on at least one occasion. Alleged perpatrator: Mama June has been pictured with Mark McDaniel, 53, who was jailed for 10 years for abusing her daughter, Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell, when she was eight . McDaniel was indicted in Spalding County for rape, child molestation, aggravated child molestation, enticing a child for indecent purposes and aggravated sexual battery. The pervert was sentenced to 10 years behind bars after pleading guilty to child molestation. He left prison in March and has reportedly been seeing Mama June again. Earlier this week, Anna revealed to People magazine that when she told her mother what McDaniel had done to her, June did not believe her. Back in her life: Mama June is pictured beside her nine-year-old daughter Alana, also known as Honey Boo Boo, and her former boyfriend Mark McDaniel (back), who was jailed for assaulting her older daughter . 'A week or so after it happened, I talked to Mama and she was upset, crying and saying, ""I don't believe you, I don't believe you, why would you do this to me?""' she remembered. 'And I was like, ""Mama, he did that to me and I can't do anything about it. You were never there to see it. You were always at work"".' McDaniel is not the only sex offender Mama June has dated. She also went out with Michael Anthony Ford, 37, the father of her 17-year-old daughter Jessica 'Chubbs' Shannon. Devastated: Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell sobs in the arms of Entertainment Tonight correspondent Nischelle Turner as she talks about how hurt she is that her mother has been seen with her molester . Moving on: Anna, left with her husband and right with their daughter, said she is hurt by reports that her mother could be back together with her abuser - and that they will not be allowed to come near her child . After the pair split, he served more than two years in prison for the sexual exploitation of a child over the internet in 2005 and remains on the sex offender registry. According to prison records, Ford is currently behind bars on a separate child abandonment charge. The fathers of Shannon’s other children also have criminal records but rather than being sex-related their crimes included arson and burglary. Sugar Bear was left shattered by the breakup of his relationship with Mama June earlier this year, friends have claimed. The split followed allegation that he had been looking at internet dating sites on the internet. This week his friend, ‘Crazy Tony’ Lindsay revealed Sugar Bear was worried about the safety of his beloved daughter Honey Boo Boo and was considering fighting for custody.","While Mama June continues to deny that she's had any contact with convicted child molester Mark McDaniel, he has been pictured laying low with a mystery woman .

"A New Zealand woman, who had no vision since she was 11, had her sight restored one night when she hit her head on a coffee table. Lisa Reid, from Auckland, has a tumour pressing down on her optic nerve and in 2000 she was not able to see at all. But on the night of November 15, 2000, that all changed when Ms Reid - who was 24 at the time - crouched down to kiss her guide dog at the time, Ami, goodnight and accidentally knocked her head on her coffee table. Lisa Reid woke up one morning in November 2000 after she bumped her head on her coffee table . The next morning, she woke up and some of her vision had been restored. 'Nobody knows what happened or can explain it,' Ms Reid, now 38, told Daily Mail Australia. 'I can't really find words to describe how it felt - amazing, fantastic. 'You can imagine not being able to see and then you can, you can't really describe that. 'To see the world again visually is a gift.' Ms Reid (pictured here with her dog, Ami,  in 2000) was 24 when he sight was partially restored . She was leaning down to kiss her dog, Ami, goodnight when she briefly struck her head . To help her cope with her visual impairment, Ms Reid has been supported by New Zealand's Blind Foundation and said without them she would be 'lost without them'. Every year the foundation hosts Blind Week - which started on October 29 this year and will run until November 3. Ms Reid is sharing her story with the world to help them raise awareness and funds to help the foundation provide the services which she has been using since she was 14. 'They've been amazing. They've helped give me the freedom to have my independence,' she said. 'I would be a bit lost without them. I'm grateful for what they've given me.' The New Zealand woman (pictured here with her daughter, Maddison, and new dog, Heidi) has been blind since she was 11 because of a tumour pressing on her optic nerve . On November 16, it will be 14 years since Ms Reid got her sight back. She recalls that one of her most shocking moments she had when she was able to see again - the changes in her brother. 'He was a man... with a goatee and everything. My brother's a man,' Ms Reid said. 'When I saw my mum, I was like: ""You look the same but older."" 'I turned into a woman and my brother turned into a man.' Funds raised during the week will help people with vision impairments to live independently, keep up with the latest technological advances, read and seek more job opportunities.

"After a nice meal out you might get the added bonus of a mint or a chocolate when your bill arrives at the end of the night. But when it comes to paying at a new restaurant in Oxford you might get a little more than you bargained for. That's because health conscious eatery Cabbages and Condoms is set to become the first in the UK to issue leaflets on protective sex when your meal ends. Bizarre: The unusual idea has been launched in the UK following success in Thailand . Sex advice with that sir? Cabbages & Condoms Thai restaurant in Bicester hands out advice on family planning at the end of the meal . Cosy atmosphere: The interior of  the Cabbages and Condoms restaurant . In a bizarre initiative started in Thailand, the restaurant aims to promote sexual health alongside its food - following success in six restaurants across the south east Asian country. The name of the eatery refers to the idea . that people should buy condoms alongside everyday mundane items such as cabbages. Merchandise: Customers can buy condom themed goods like mugs, keyrings and books . And if the name wasn't strange enough it also comes with the slogan 'And remember, our food is guaranteed not to cause pregnancy.' Diners at the new restaurant will get the chance to sample traditional Thai food 'in a cosy atmosphere' before they are presented with the information on sexual health and even urged to buy some of its unusual condom-themed merchandise. Among them are condom-themed mugs, keyrings and books and even a mascot made out of the contraceptive. The strange but unique idea originated in the Thai capital of Bangkok where its restaurants even distribute condoms with the bill. In some of them there are even statues made out of condoms while they also adorn walls and ceilings used as decoration. But if reviews of its eateries in Thailand are anything to go by, its not just a restaurant with a message. Marian Burros of The New York Times singled out the 'fascinating' dim sum and 'wonderfully herbaceous' shrimp soup among . the 'well-prepared straightforward food that is very reasonably priced.' The idea came together as a result of the desperate need in the country to promote better understanding and . acceptance of family planning. A number of items will be available on sale as the restaurant aims to help promote sexual health in the UK . The new eatery in Bicester, Oxfordshire, even comes with the slogan 'and remember our food is guaranteed not to cause pregnancy' Former politician and activist in . Thailand Mechai Viravaidya popularised condoms, family planning and AIDS . awareness in the country and helped establish Cabbages and Condoms. He continues to oversee rural . development and health initiatives and in 2007 the non governmental . organisation which he founded to continue the work was awarded the  Bill . & Melinda Gates Foundation's Gates Award in recognition of its . pioneering work in family planning and HIV/AIDS prevention.

"Ancient human remains of what has been dubbed the 'oldest Parisian' have been uncovered in silts close to the River Seine in France. Archaeologists unearthed 200,000-year-old left arm bones at Tourville-la-Rivière which are believed to belong to a young Neanderthal. An unusual raised ridge on the upper-arm bone suggests that the Neanderthal suffered should muscle damage from repeatedly throwing a spear. Human remains of what has been dubbed the 'oldest Parisian' have been found in silts close to the River Seine in France. Pictured are the remains (left) alongside the equivalent arm bones of a female Neanderthal . If this proves to be true, it could provide evidence that Neanderthals were capable of creating throwing spears, rather than simply using thrusting weapons to hunt. 'We have a particular morphology on the humerus where we have this very important crest that is related probably to a specific movement - a specific movement that has been repeated by this individual,' Dr Bruno Maureille a palaeontologist at the National Centre for Scientific Research told the BBC. 'Right at that point, we have a kind of micro-trauma, which could be related to a movement that is more difficult, and it has created this strange relief.' The arm bones – a humerus, radius and ulna – were found by archaeologists from the French National Institute for Preventive Archaeological Research. he unusual crest was revealed using computer tomography scans which found it may have been created by an injury to the deltoid muscle at the owner's shoulder. Pictured are CT-based 3D mapping of the thickness of the bones in the latest find . The unusual crest was revealed using computer tomography scans which found it may have been created by an injury to the deltoid muscle at the owner's shoulder. The interpretation that thrown spears were used 200,000 years ago in Europe is 'controversial' according to Brian Richmond, a curator at the American Museum of Natural History in New York speaking with Live Science. But a separate study earlier this year uncovered 80,000-year-old spear tips which scientist believe were probably created by ancestors to ancient humans, rather than by our species. Controversy surrounds the precise date that early man began to use stone-tipped spears - with some experts suggesting their use as far back as 500,000 years ago. A separate study done in May by Corey O'Driscoll, of South East Archaeology in Canberra, Australia, Professor O'Driscoll shaped flint reproductions of spear and arrow points from the Middle Stone Age in Africa and attached them to wooden shafts. Together with a group of University of Queensland students, O'Driscoll ran 15 experiments, throwing replica spears with bows or a calibrated crossbow at lamb and cow carcasses. The results showed 'quite a difference between the butchering marks and projectile impact marks,' and revealed six types of distinctive projectile impact wounds, from drag marks to fracture marks and punctures. These findings prompted O'Driscoll and the University of Queensland's Jessica Thompson to take a new look at three bone specimens from large unidentified mammals - a rib and two vertebrae - from Pinnacle Point Cave in South Africa. Two dated to between 91,000 and 98,000 years ago and the third dated even earlier, between 153,000 and 174,000 years ago - making them, at the time, the oldest direct evidence of the use of projectile weapons. This discovery means Homo heidelbergensis, an ancestor to both humans and Neanderthals, was much more technologically advanced than previously thought. Homo sapiens then either developed the technology themselves, or learned it from Homo heidelbergensis, which helped them to move out of Africa and out-compete Neanderthals. Researchers are now studying the stone javelin tips, recently found at an Ethiopian Stone Age site known as Gademotta. The arm bones – a humerus, radius and ulna – were found by archaeologists from the French National Institute for Preventive Archaeological Research. Pictured is the river bank where they were found . Researchers made their find at Tourville-la-Rivière, roughly 100km from the French capital, Paris . Scientists the University of California at Berkeley's Human Evolution Research Center were recently able to study the spears and determine their age. Writing in the journal Plos One, they claim the weapons were made from obsidian - a naturally occurring volcanic glass known for its high blast resistance and strength. '[This] is significant because it provides direct evidence for a highly advantageous, complex technology that pre-dates the emergence of Homo sapiens,' said the authors of the study. Researchers believe the direct ancestor of Homo sapiens in Africa, and Neanderthals in Europe and Asia, is the Homo heidelbergensis, also known as Heidelberg Man. Previous evidence shows that Heidelberg Man was an accomplished tool-maker and skillfully butchered large animals. However, the stone-tipped spears have provided a clearer understanding of the extent of this species skills. The oldest known stone-tipped spears predate the earliest known human fossils by 85,000 years. This image shows a sample of Gademotta pointed artifacts exhibiting fractures indicative of weapons that would have been thrown .","Archaeologists unearthed the left arm bones  at Tourville-la-Rivière .

"Two former top advisers to Bill Clinton have warned Barack Obama that he will lose to Mitt Romney in November if he does not abandon the ‘fool’s errand’ of trying to persuade Americans that the economy is getting better. In a 16-page paper, James Carville, Clinton’s top campaign manager in 1992, Stan Greenberg, Clinton’s pollster in 1992, and Erica Seifert, a leading Democratic strategist, argue that a ‘new narrative’ is needed for Obama to win re-election. Carville coined the dictum ‘it’s the economy, stupid’, while Greenberg was the person who identified ‘Reagan Democrats’ as a key voting bloc in the 1980s. Pendulum swing: Two former Clinton aides released a 16-page paper warning that the trajectory of Obama's current re-election campaign could cost him the presidency; he is pictured today talking about the economy . Fool's errand: The former aides said that Romney, seen today in Orlando, could win if Obama keeps insisting the economy is better . Their stinging critique is a sign of panic among Democrats about Obama’s campaign as well as a potential split between Obama and old hands from the Clinton era who believe he has moved too far to the Left. Obama and Romney are currently in a statistical dead heat in most national polls with Obama leading by 1.6 per cent in the RealClearPolitics average. In a commentary for Fox News, Joe Trippi, a veteran Democratic campaign strategist said: ‘I believe the race is even tighter than the Real Clear Politics averages indicate’. About face: James Carville argues that a 'new narrative' is necessary for Obama to win in 2012 . He added: ‘Five months is a long time in presidential politics -- the pendulum can swing back and forth several times between now and November. But at this moment, as a Democrat who wants to see Barack Obama re-elected, there is no denying that the pendulum is moving in the wrong direction.’ The paper, by Democracy Corps and Greenberg Quinlan Rosner, is based on extensive work with focus groups in Ohio and Pennsylvania, states that Hillary Clinton won in the Democratic primaries of 2008 and where Obama has struggled to connect with blue collar voters. ‘It is elites who are creating a conventional wisdom that an incumbent president must run on his economic performance – and therefore must convince voters that things are moving in the right direction,’ the top Democratic strategists contend. ‘They are wrong, and that will fail.’ The paper could be seen as a pre-emptive post mortem should Obama lose to Romney in November, perhaps laying the foundation for a presidential bid by Hillary Clinton in 2016. Its argument is all the more devastating for Obama because it identifies fundamental weaknesses in Romney’s candidacies, arguing that it is only what they see as Romney’s significant vulnerabilities that has kept Obama in contention. The strategists state bluntly that voters don’t believe Obama’s central campaign message that the economy is getting better. ‘These voters are not convinced that we are headed in the right direction. They are living in a new economy - and there is no conceivable recovery in the year ahead that will change the view of the new state of the country. Fast friends: Carville, right, was top aide to former President Bill Clinton in 1992; they are pictured at an event in 1999 . Nothing but grey skies: Left, the president walks in the rain across the South Lawn towards Marine One before he departs the White House, and right, speaks during an election campaign event in Baltimore . ‘They actually have a very realistic view of the long road back and the struggles of the middle class - and the current narrative about progress just misses the opportunity to connect and point forward. While we hear some optimism, this is framed mostly by the sense that this has to be rock bottom.' This means that Obama ‘will face an impossible headwind in November, unless his campaign shifts to a more realistic economic message that offers solutions to voters who are struggling terribly. 'The pendulum can swing back and forth . several times between now and November. But...as a . Democrat who wants to see Barack Obama re-elected, there is no denying . that the pendulum is moving in the wrong direction.' -Democratic strategist Joe Trippi . The key to an Obama victory, the paper says, is a new message ‘with minimal discussion of the recovery and jobs created and maximal empathy for the challenges people face’. Obama, the paper suggests, risks being seen as out of touch with ordinary Americans if he keeps pretending things are improving. ‘These voters want to know that he understands the struggle of working families and has plans to make things better.’ This comment comes after Obama’s remark on Friday that ‘the private sector is doing just fine’ prompted a furore and gleeful attacks from Romney and other Republicans. Obama has repeatedly stressed ‘progress’ in interviews this week. On Friday, he opened by saying that ‘after losing jobs for 25 months in a row, our businesses have now created jobs for 27 months in a row - 4.3 million new jobs in all’ and ‘job growth in this recovery has been stronger than in the one following the last recession a decade ago’. The strategists state, however, that ‘the current narrative about progress just misses the opportunity to connect and point forward’. Bill Clinton recently made clear his dissatisfaction with Obama’s message, particularly the attacks on Romney’s work as a venture capitalist with Bain Capital. Telling CNN that Romney had had a ‘good business career’ at Bain, he said: ‘I don't think that we ought to get into the position where we say “This is bad work”. This is good work. The man who has been governor and had a sterling business career crosses the qualification threshold.’","Top Democratic aides in Clinton administration argue in 16-page paper that Obama needs new strategy to win voters for second term .

"Pictured: Shiite leader Rasoul Al-Musawi, who was shot outside an Islamic prayer centre by people claiming to be supporters of the Islamic State . Fear of revenge attacks follow the shooting of a Shiite Muslim in a drive-by attack in Sydney's south-west. Rasoul Al-Musawi was closing up an Islamic prayer centre on Rosedale Avenue is Greenacre when the attack occurred, with friends claiming he was targeted targeted by people claiming to be supporters of Islamic State. Mr Al-Musawi was shot in the face and shoulder while he was with his wife and four of his children at the Husainiyah Nabi Akram centre. Mr Al-Musawi's friend - who did not wish to be named - is a Shiite Muslim and said the shooting in Greenacre was motivated by the sectarian struggle in the Middle East. 'They called us ""Shia dogs"" and they threatened to come back down tonight and kill you, shoot you, whatever,' he told ABC Radio on Monday. The man said they had taken no notice of the threats made on the night of the shooting - which also included 'IS lives forever' - but then he received a phone call saying his friend had been shot. 'He was walking his family home so he can come back and do the cleaning [at the Islamic Centre] and they shot him in front of his family,' he said. 'His wife, she just fainted.' Mr Al-Musawi's daughter said he was shot from behind and she and her father were leaving the Islamic prayer centre. 'We heard two loud bangs. My dad just held his neck and ran inside,' she told Network Ten. 'All I see was blood running down his head and neck.' He is now in a stable condition after undergoing surgery, and police described his wounds as 'not life threatening'. Scroll down for video . Police are investigating a drive-by shooting where the phrases 'ISIS lives forever' were heard being shouted hours before a man was shot . The 47-year-old man was a Shiite Muslim leader at the Islamic prayer centre in Sydney's south-west . Mr Al-Musawi's daughter said he was shot from behind and she and her father were leaving the Islamic prayer centre . ISIS (Islamic State in Iraq and Syria) refers to terror group Islamic State who are based in Syria and Iraq. The extremist militants see Shiite Muslims as a threat to their end goal of establishing a caliphate in the Middle East because the sect makes up most of the Iraqi Government who are opposed to the Sunni-dominated regime. A police spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia  they were not disclosing which hospital he had been taken to due to his personal safety. 'As a precautionary measure, we're not giving that out,' she said. Well-known member of the Shiite community Jamal Daoud said this was not the first time worshippers had been targeted while they were trying to pay their respects during Ashura - a 10-day tradition which marks Imam Hussain's death. Imam Hussain was the grandson of Prophet Muhammed. Mr Daoud told The Sydney Morning Herald the centre had experienced a few attacks in recent days. On Friday about 8pm, a security officer employed by the centre was attacked by three men who hit him in the face, Mr Daoud said. On Monday, members of the Shiite Muslim prayer centre congregate outside as police visit . Detectives leave the centre on Monday after speaking with members of the Rosedale Avenue place of worship . Police are yet to discover if the shooting and the threats made from a car were related . He said the 'extremists' were deliberately trying to threaten the Shiite community and the people he had talked to were 'very concerned' and 'very scared'. 'This is very dangerous. It's a warning something bigger could happen.' In a statement, NSW Police said they would like to hear from anyone who may have seen a vehicle driving in the vicinity of the location at the time of the shooting. Investigators are still yet to see if the two incidents are connected. Members of the centre took care of the man's injuries until paramedics arrived after taking him off the street and back inside the building he had just exited, 9News reported.

Firearm detection dogs were seen searching the centre and the areas around it. Officers investigating the shooting are asking those who had not already spoken to police to contact them. They are still trying to figure out why the attack had been carried out. 'At this point in time it does not appear that there is any type of motivation for the shooting,' Inspector Dave Firth said.

"His enduring image is as the father of India, the loincloth-clad hero of his country’s struggle for independence. But newly revealed letters have added to the speculation about a secret side to Mahatma Gandhi. They detail his close friendship with a South African bodybuilder, Hermann Kallenbach, with some suggesting the pair may have had a physical relationship. Lovers? Mahatma Gandhi (left) and Hermann Kallenbach (right) sit either side of a . female companion. A collection of . letters between the two men have gone on display at India's National Archives . The letters, written by Gandhi, went on show in New Delhi yesterday, the 65th anniversary of his assassination. One, handwritten to Kallenbach, is addressed to ‘My dear Lower House’ and signed ‘Sinly yours, Upper House’. However scholars looking for clear evidence of the full extent of the men’s relationship, the subject of speculation for years, were left disappointed. The archive of letters and photos belonging to Kallenbach was purchased by the Indian government last year, just before it was due to be auctioned by Sotheby’s in London. Curators acknowledge that they have put only a sample of the correspondence on display at the National Archives museum. Mushirul Hasan, chief of the National Archives, denied that the collection had been screened and controversial letters left out because of Gandhi’s iconic status. ‘These are original letters and we have provided a sample of the correspondence between Gandhi and Kallenbach. There is a lot that is new and significant,’ he said. ‘Nothing controversial has been left out or necessarily included. The documents previously belonged to relatives of Kallenbach, a . German-born Jewish architect who met Gandhi in South Africa in 1904 and . was impressed by his ideas . Gandhi and Kallenbach (middle row, centre) pose for a picture at Tolstoy Farm, South Africa in 1910. They became constant companions after they met in Johannesburg in 1904 . ‘They had a marvellous relationship and the archives reveal the intensity of that relationship.’ Gandhi moved to South Africa in 1893 after training as a lawyer. He already had a wife, Kasturba, as a result of an arranged marriage in 1883, according to local custom, when he was 13 and she was 14. The couple had four sons: Harilal, born in 1888; Manilal, born in 1892; Ramdas, born in 1897; and Devdas, born in 1900. His wife joined him in South Africa in 1897 and they lived there until returning to India in 1914 to join the gathering political movement against British colonial rule. Gandhi (left) and Kallenbach  lived together for . two years in a house in South Africa. Joseph Lelyveld's controversial . biography Great Soul: Mahatma Gandhi And His Struggle With India (right) was published in 2011 . The archive display coincides with the 65th anniversary of Gandhi's death. This picture shows Indian school children paying homage at a memorial statue in Bhubaneswar . Kallenbach, a German-born Jewish . architect, lived with Gandhi in Johannesburg for about two years from . 1907 – a year after Gandhi took a public vow of celibacy. The relationship between Gandhi and . the wealthy South African was chronicled in a book two years ago by . Joseph Lelyveld, former editor of the New York Times. In Great Soul: Mahatma Gandhi And His . Struggle With India, Lelyveld quotes a letter from Gandhi to Kallenbach . in which he wrote: ‘How completely you have taken possession of my . body. This is slavery with a vengeance.’ Lelyveld defended his book . against accusations that he had suggested Gandhi was bisexual. ‘The word . “bisexual” nowhere appears in the book,’ he wrote afterwards. School children dressed as Mahatma Gandhi assemble to mark his anniversary in the southern Indian city of Chennai . Raj Bala Jain, part of the National . Archives team that studied the Kallenbach collection in detail, said she . was surprised how their relationship had been misconstrued. ‘I did not find even a single letter with sexual overtones,’ she said. ‘Friendship can be misinterpreted. I think Gandhi was very normal and above such things.’ Indians fret about auctions of . Gandhi’s belongings, saying they insult the memory of a man who rejected . material wealth. ‘We are talking about Gandhi. Such emotions are . justified,’ said Mr Hasan.","Letters displayed in India's national archives reveal 'loving relationship'

"Hundreds of people ran into the sea naked as temperatures plummeted in an attempt to set a new world record for the biggest ever skinny dip. A crowd of just over 200 people stripped off and ran into the sea at sunrise for The North East Skinny Dip in Druridge Bay, Northumberland, but failed to break the record. The event was organised to raise money for mental health charity Mind and those involved are confident they have raised thousands. Scroll down for video . Going for it: Skinny dippers take a hands-on approach to the attempt to set a new world record in Druridge Bay, Northumberland, at sunrise yesterday .

People taking part said they also used it to celebrate their bodies as well as mark the autumn equinox. Organiser Jacqueline Higginson, 34, from Whitburn, said: 'I did a skinny dip last year where we broke the world record. I don’t think there was enough to do it [yesterday] but there was enough of us for it to be a lot of fun. 'We chose Mind because I feel very close to the issues around mental health both personally and as a paramedic as I see it all around me. 'And hopefully I think we have raised thousands of pounds for Mind.' Jumping for joy: One dipper leaps out of the water as an icy wave approaches . Hand-in-hand: A pair bring in the autumn together on the beach . Spectacular sunrise: The arrival on the autumn equinox means dawn arrives later and night falls more quickly . Last year, a skinny dip was held at . Rhossili beach in Wales, where more than 400 people plunged naked into . the sea and raised money for cancer and the National Trust. Ms Higginson took part in that event and that gave her the inspiration to organise a similar event in the North East. The National trust, which owns the section of beach they used, gave their permission for the cheeky event to take place.","Raised thousands of pounds for mental health charity Mind .

"Most people were shocked while reading EL James' raunchy mummy porn trilogy Fifty Shades Of Grey at the idea that a man might have a contractual sexual relationship with a woman. But now one real-life Christian Grey has come forward to explain why he ritualistically enters into precisely this sort of 'arrangement'. Dexter Koh, a 30-year-old businessman from Shoreditch in east London, boasts a six-figure salary and a penchant for providing the women he dates with the finest things in life...in return for sex. Koh, who runs a PR company, has been finding female students on a 'sugar daddy' dating website since he was 28, with whom he enters into 'mutually beneficial arrangements' Koh sees similarities between himself and Grey, the protagonist of the Fifty series which details the S&M relationship between Christian Grey and student Anastasia Steele. He admits he enjoys the comparisons with Grey - also a successful businessman who insists upon having contracts with the women he dates - saying: 'Half the women in the world are infatuated with Christian Grey. 'Yes, . he has his dark side, but what single guy in his thirties wouldn't want . beautiful young students throwing themselves at him?' Koh, who runs a PR company, has been finding female students on a 'sugar daddy' dating website since he was 28, with whom he enters into 'mutually beneficial arrangements'. These are contracts between him and the girls where, according to a spokesman for the site, 'they give him sex and show him a good time, and he lavishes them with riches'. One of the first students Koh dated on the site was Melissa, a 21-year-old studying languages at Oxford University. He said: 'We hit it off straight away by email and quickly arranged to meet at a pub in Woodstock near Oxford. The average British sugar daddy earns £170,000 a year and spends £1,500 a month on girls he meets . 'She was blonde, tall, sophisticated and very well-read and travelled - she was everything I look for in a woman. We entered into a mutually beneficial arrangement. 'I was paying her around £1,000 a month - sometimes more depending on how often we'd see each other. 'We'd go away for weekends -Paris, Berlin, Milan. We'd stay somewhere nice, have great sex and just enjoy each other's company. At some point we'd always go shopping and I'd treat her - shoes, dresses, you name it. The best designer labels. 'The sex was fantastic. The Fifty Shades of Grey books are pretty dark. We'd indulge in a bit of role play but nothing as sinister as Christian and Ana - we'd just have fun.' Koh said said the arrangement worked for both of them: 'Melissa got help with her student fees and I'd got a beautiful young girlfriend. 'I treated her in just the same way as I would if we had met in the bar - but this way you can establish that arrangement a little quicker than you would ordinarily. You are both aware of what is expected of you right from the beginning. 'Neither of us wanted anything heavy - and we parted amicably after a couple of months.' By then Koh had met Jane, a . 22-year-old studying fashion in London. He said: 'She had very expensive . tastes so we went shopping a lot. 'She . had joined the site because she wanted to live the life of a celebrity . but on student money. She was very sexy and loved to be dominated.' Dexter Koh, a 30-year-old businessman from Shoreditch in east London, boasts a six-figure salary and a penchant for providing the women he dates with the finest things in life...in return for sex . Koh also dated a recent graduate from Bristol University he met on the site, Seeking Arrangement. Polly, 24, had student debts of £62,000 and was living in London trying to get a job in television. Kor said: 'There was no way she could have survived financially without the help of a sugar daddy. 'I really felt sorry for her - she was worried sick about her debt. 'I really don't know how some students cope without having very rich parents. 'I admired Polly because she was determined to make it in TV and was basically working as in intern for no money. 'She had dated several sugar daddies before me. 'She was totally unapologetic about it and admitted that once she had got her career and her finances sorted she would quit the site.'

"Most women treated for breast cancer during pregnancy or women who become pregnant after undergoing treatment for the disease go on to have healthy babies, experts have said. Breast cancer is rare in younger women, although The Royal College of Obstetricians  and Gynaecologists (RCOG) say that the number who go on to have babies after being treated for the disease is increasing. Around 50,000 women are affected by breast cancer every year, but the RCOG said that treatment success rates in the UK are good and are continually improving, with five-year survival rates currently around 80 percent for the under-50s age group. Positive: Experts at the The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists say that most women treated for breast cancer during pregnancy or women who become pregnant after undergoing treatment for the disease go on to have healthy babies (picture posed by models) On rare occasions, breast cancer is diagnosed during pregnancy and the RCOG has published new patient information published outlining details for women who are pregnant and have been diagnosed with breast cancer, or who have recovered and are planning a family. Philippa Marsden, chair of the RCOG Patient Information Committee, said: 'It is important to emphasise that breast cancer during pregnancy is rare, with 1.3 to 2.4 cases per 10,000 live births. 'Being diagnosed with breast cancer whilst pregnant can be extremely frightening. However, a specialist team including a consultant obstetrician, midwife and breast team will look after a woman throughout her pregnancy and ensure the best possible outcome for both mother and baby.' For women diagnosed with breast cancer while pregnant, treatment will usually begin straight away and will be offered according to the type and extent of the cancer with a multidisciplinary team on hand to discuss all available treatment options. Improving: Around 50,000 women are affected by breast cancer every year, but the RCOG said that treatment success rates in the UK are good and are continually improving (picture posed by models) These include surgery to remove the lump or the affected breast. Surgery can be carried out at any stage in pregnancy, the RCOG said. Chemotherapy is not given during the first 13 weeks of pregnancy as it may cause abnormalities in the baby but after that, it is safe and chemotherapy may be offered to women fighting the disease. The anti-sickness and steroid treatments that control chemotherapy side effects are also safe and will not cause harm to the baby, but radiotherapy is not usually offered as a treatment option until after the birth. Two commonly used drugs - tamoxifen and herceptin - are often given after the initial treatment to reduce the chance of the cancer recurring. These drugs are not recommended during pregnancy and will be delayed until after the birth. Cath Broderick, chair of the RCOG Women’s Network, said: 'The diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer is improving all the time and we are now seeing more women than ever surviving the disease. 'Being pregnant does not seem to affect how successful treatment is. This patient information gives a lot of reassurance and advice for women in this situation.'","Disease affects 50,000 in the UK every year but is rare in younger women .

"Caught out: Jeremy Clarkson has been given the first points on his driving licence in 30 years after being caught speeding . After being chased out of Argentina by an angry mob, you would think that Jeremy Clarkson would keep a low profile for at least a few weeks. But the under fire Top Gear presenter has found himself in trouble again after getting a speeding ticket for the first time in 30 years. The controversial motoring show host wrote in his column that he had been travelling '80 something' in a 60mph zone, and brushed off the incident, saying it was 'nothing catastrophic, nobody died.' Clarkson was snapped by a speed camera while driving too fast on a 260-mile drive from Whitby, North Yorkshire, to London. Despite noticing the cameras on a stretch of the M1 near Derby, Clarkson, 54, was caught out for the first time in three decades. He was told he was driving too quickly to attend a speed awareness course and was given points on his licence. When asked what speed he was doing when he was snapped by the fixed camera, Clarkson told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I can’t even remember, 80 something, 82 in a 60, nothing catastrophic.’ He added: ‘I was only a couple of miles over being allowed to do the [course], it’s not catastrophic, nobody died.’ Road safety campaigners jumped on his comments as irresponsible. Amy Aeron-Thomas, executive director of RoadPeace, a charity for crash victims, said his comments were ‘absolutely shocking’. ‘We should penalise people for excessive speed – it’s risk-related and it’s dangerous,’ she said, adding: ‘We should expect more from him and he should be able to afford a car with a speed limiter if needs be.’ Clarkson previously caused offence with a speeding remark in 2008 when he claimed to have driven 186mph on a public road, saying: ‘The speed limit’s annoying for people who have a job to do.’ Writing in his column for The Sun last month, Clarkson moaned about the number of speed cameras he passed while on the long drive to London in a BMW M3. Earlier this month,  Clarkson and the Top Gear crew were attacked by an angry mob in Argentina after a row over the number plate on a car he was driving through the South American country . Firstly, the Top Gear host passed a speed camera van on what he described as a 'magnificent road' over Fylingdales Moor. He said he was still 'lightly fuming' when he was then restricted to a 50mph speed limit for a long stretch of the M1 between Sheffield and the turn-off for Derby. The furious BBC presenter wrote in his column in September that he would like to 'stick some cocktail sticks into [the] eyes' of the person who came up with the speed restriction. He added: 'And it gets worse because when the roadworks finally ended, I found myself on a stretch where there are speed-camera gantries every few hundred yards, to catch those who are desperate to make up for lost time.' It seems that despite taking note of the cameras, Clarkson did not slow down enough. Today he complained that the cameras had caught him, handing him his first points since the 1980s. He wrote: 'Last month, I wrote in a blind fury about how many speed cameras I'd encountered on a drive from Whitby to London. 'Well, it seems one of them got me. Sadly, I was going too quickly for the speed awareness course to be an option. Which means I'm getting some points on my licence. My first in 30 years. Grrrrr.'","Jeremy Clarkson caught speeding while driving from Yorkshire to London .

"Game of Thrones gave us a shock earlier this month during a harrowing event, dubbed the Purple Wedding. During the scene, a major character was killed by drinking from a poisoned chalice. As the trial for the suspected killer begins, the American Chemical Society has created a video explaining the science behind the poisoning and what plant may have been used in the plot. Warning: Spoilers appear below . A chemical expert from Nebraska has created a video explaining the science behind the poisoning. By looking at the symptoms and cause of death, Dr Raychelle Burks selects three possible naturally-occurring suspects - Deadly Night Shade, Poison Hemlock and the Strychnine Tree, pictured . The poison was said to have come from a plant, which Dr Raychelle Burks narrows down to three dangerous plants, namely Deadly Night Shade, Poison Hemlock and Styrchnine Tree. All three plants produce alkaloids, which have at least one, potentially fatal, nitrogen atom in the heterocyclic ring. Dangerous alkaloids include atropine, coniine and strychnine. In the show, The Strangler poison caused the muscles in the victim’s . neck to clench together restricting the flow of air to the body. Deadly Night Shade, also known as Atropa Belladona, and Hemlock affect muscles, however they cause these muscles to relax, not tighten. Strychnine, on the other hand, not only causes the muscles to convulse, these symptoms start in the face and neck - which fits with the show. During the episode, much-hated King Joffrey dies during his wedding to Margaery Tyrell after drinking wine from the poisoned cup. The poison is dubbed The Strangler because it causes Joffrey to choke and grab at his throat. Chemist Dr Raychelle Burks from Doane College in Nebraska has investigated what this poison could have been and why it caused the physical reactions in the TV show. She narrows it down to three potentially poisonous plants - namely Deadly Night Shade, Poison Hemlock and Styrchnine Tree. ‘All three of these plants share something in common,’ Dr Burks explained. ‘They all make alkaloids.’ In general terms, alkaloids are naturally-occurring compounds that have at least one nitrogen atom in the heterocyclic ring. Dangerous alkaloids include atropine, coniine and strychnine. In the TV show, and George R.R Martin’s books, The Strangler poison causes the muscles in the victim’s neck to clench together restricting the flow of air to the body. All three plants produce alkaloids, which have at least one, potentially fatal, nitrogen atom in the heterocyclic ring. Dangerous alkaloids include atropine, coniine and strychnine, pictured. In the show, The Strangler poison caused the muscles in the victim's neck to clench together and choke them . According to Dr Burks, this means the poison can’t be the first two suspects - Deadly Night Shade, also known as Atropa Belladona, and Hemlock - because although they affect the muscles, they cause these muscles to relax, not tighten. This leaves strychnine. ‘Around 10 to 20 minutes after you inject a lethal dose of strychnine, your going to start feeling your muscles convulse, in the face and neck first,’ Dr Burks said. ‘This kind of fits in with how [Game of Thrones author] Martin describes The Strangler.’ According to Dr Burks, the poison couldn't be the first two suspects - Deadly Night Shade, also known as Atropa Belladona, and Hemlock - because although they affect muscles, they cause these muscles to relax, not tighten. This leaves strychnine which causes muscles to convulse in the face and neck . In the books, The Strangler is made using the leaves of a plant ‘from the sea of Jade half the world away’ and is extracted with a ‘wash of lime and sugar.’ It’s true styrchnine can be found in the leaves of a plant, but it can’t be extracted using limes. However, alkaloids can be extracted using a process involving calcium oxide, which is a limestone product. Dr Burks continued that sugar may have been used to disguise the bitter taste of the strychnine plant and concluded is likely the evil fictional king was murdered by this chemical. ‘Sometimes science gets a bad rap. People think it's dry or super serious,' Burks said. ‘Pop culture is really a good medium to talk about science in a way that anyone and everyone can participate.’","A major Game of Thrones character was recently poisoned and killed .

"No it's not Australia's new high-speed crime fighting car - but if it was, it would have speeding crooks quaking in their boots. It's a $200,000 promotional sports car, a Porsche 911 Carrera actually, which has been unleashed on schools across Sydney,NSW as a part of a campaign to grab students' attention and get them engaging with the state's police force. The mean-looking motor vehicle joined a northern Sydney fleet of squad cars this year, after the success of an earlier Porsche model - the Panamera - which was first issued to police for the same promotional reasons in 2012.

It is suitably equipped, however, as a weapon for high-speed chases with sirens and flashing lights attached. At top speed, the blue-and-white cheque sports car  is able to reach 259km/hr but that speed is rarely, if ever, required. What does work best on students though is its sleek design and unique markings - the brain child of a university student who won a competition to have them plastered on the side of the vehicle. The earlier model Panamera was provided to the NSW Police by Cars Australia back in 2012 - but the new model has since been rolled-out with a  face-lift . It is worth $200,000 and comes fully equipped with all the tools you would find in an ordinary patrol car . For the past two years, Porsche Cars Australia have sponsored a Porsche Panamera for officers from Harbourside Local Area Command to attend schools, community events, charity fund-raisers and local youth programs, and generate positive interactions between police and the community. The success of the program has seen Porsche Cars Australia extend their support to sponsoring this white 2014 Porsche 911 Carrera, which will continue to visit events across the state. Porsche Cars Australia managing director, Michael Winkler said its roll-out was the first  of its kind when it was  issued to the NSW police force in 2012. 'This is the first time we've made available a Porsche to any police force in Australia and the curiosity factor alone of a Panamera in police decals should help the NSW Police achieve awareness and engage people in its community programs'. The new vehicle, with blue and white cheques, is an upgraded version of an earlier model rolled-out in 2012 . The car belongs to the Harbourside Police force, which operates in Sydney's north shore .

"Britain is being sued with France and the Netherlands by 14 Caribbean countries demanding what could be hundreds of billions of pounds in reparations for slavery. Around 175 years after Britain freed its last slaves in the West Indies, an alliance of Caribbean nations is demanding to be repaid for the 'awful', lingering legacy of the Atlantic slave trade. Caricom, a group of 12 former British colonies together with the former French colony Haiti and the Dutch-held Suriname, believes the European governments should pay – and the UK in particular. Legal action: Britain, France and the Netherlands are being sued by 14 Caribbean countries for what could be billions of pounds in reparations for slavery, illustrated here in this 1861 drawing of a chain gang . 'Awful legacy': In a speech at United Nations General Assembly last month (above), Prime Minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Ralph Gonsalves, said European nations must pay for the slave trade . It has hired the British law firm Leigh Day, which recently won compensation for hundreds of Kenyans tortured by the British colonial government during the Mau Mau rebellion of the 1950s. Caricom has not specified how much money . they are seeking but senior officials have pointed out that Britain paid . slave owners £20 million when it abolished slavery in 1834. That sum . would be the equivalent of £200 billion today. In the United States, the idea of reparations has surfaced a number of times over the years, but have never been paid out. At the end of the Civil War, around 400,000 acres of land in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina were taken from former slave owners and earmarked for freed slaves. 'Britain will be at the forefront of this claim,' says Day enthusiastically. 'We undoubtedly face more claims than others because we were the primary colonial power in  the Caribbean and primary operators of the slave trade' Migration: A map shows the main transatlantic routes out of Africa during the slave trade from 1500-1900 . A look back: A map depicts the slave and non-slaveholding states at the outbreak of the Civil War, along with the dates when each non-slaveholding state legally ended slavery . Portuguese traders built sub-Saharan Africa's first permanent slave trading post at Elmina in 1492. It passed into Dutch and English hands and by the 18th century they shipped tens of thousands of Africans a year through 'the door of no return' onto squalid slave ships bound for plantations of the Americas. European traders would sail to the west coast of Africa with manufactured goods which they exchanged for people captured by African traders. The European merchants would then cross the Atlantic with ships full of slaves on the notorious 'Middle Passage'. Conditions were so torrid that many of the captors, who often had barely any space to move, did not survive the journey. Those who made the voyage were destined to work on plantations that produced products such as sugar or tobacco for consumption back in Europe. By the end of the 18th Century, campaigners called for the abolition of the trade, but this was fiercely opposed because it was so profitable. After years of campaigning by anti-slavery activists like politician William Wilberforce, Britain banned the trade in slaves from Africa on March 25, 1807. Slavery itself was not outlawed by Britain for another generation, in 1833, and the transatlantic trade continued under foreign flags for many years. Some estimates say as many as 60million people were shipped into bondage. But the decision was reversed by . President Andrew Johnson after President Abraham Lincoln's assassination . in 1865, it was noted by Al Jazeera America. In 2008, Barack Obama said he did not support reparations to the descendants of slaves, going against the views of around two dozen members of Congress who sponsored legislation to create a commission on slavery. In the same year, the House apologised for slavery, with the Senate following suit in 2009, but neither mentioned compensation. In its lawsuit, Caricom claims slavery condemned the region to a poverty that still afflicts it today. And they are comparing their demand to Germany recompensing Jewish people for the Holocaust and New Zealand compensating Maoris. 'The . awful legacy of these crimes against humanity ought to be repaired for . the developmental benefit of our Caribbean societies and all our . peoples,' said Ralph Gonsalves, the prime minister of the tiny Saint . Vincent and the Grenadines. He called it a 'historic wrong that has to . be righted'. Verene . Shepherd, who is coordinating Jamaica’s demands for reparations, said . their slave ancestors 'got nothing' when they were freed. 'They got their freedom and they were told ‘Go develop yourselves’,' she said. Critics . have pointed out that many of Caricom’s members are hardly poor – . including millionaire havens such as the Bahamas and Barbados. Prime . minister Tony Blair expressed regret for the 'unbearable suffering' caused by Britain’s role in slavery in 2007 but made no mention of . financial compensation. Britain has said that paying reparations for slavery is the wrong way to address 'an historical problem'. The scheme has been drawn up by British lawyer Martyn Day who pursued claims on behalf of Kenyan Mau Mau veterans, which resulted in payments to 5,228 survivors of £19.9¿million of British taxpayers' money for their alleged suffering during the Fifties uprising against British rule . Caricom . insists they are hoping to reach a settlement with the European . countries and will only take legal action if talks collapse. A Caricom reparations commission has been set up to work out should be paid and how much, led by Barbados historian Sir Hilary Beckles. Sir Hilary says they are 'focusing' on Britain because it was the largest slave owner in the 1830s. 'The British made the most money out of slavery and the slave trade - they got the lion’s share. And, importantly, they knew how to convert slave profits into industrial profits,' he said. Some Caricom countries already get financial aid from Britain and other Commonwealth countries. Martyn Day, the British lawyer who is advising Caricom, told the Daily Mail he doubted it would affect their membership of the Commonwealth. 'I know they are hoping they can resolve this amicably rather than having to take matters through the courts,' he said. He said: 'Our advice has been that the Caribbean states should be claiming in relation to the impact of the slave trade on the Caribbean today rather than looking for reparations related to what happened to the slaves historically.'","Countries demanding compensation for 'awful' legacy of Atlantic trade .

"The naked rambler Stephen Gough, 53, arrives at court in Fife after being arrested for walking around naked . The man known as ‘The Naked Rambler’ has yet again been arrested for breaching the peace, this time for walking close to a children's play park wearing nothing but his birthday suit. Stephen Gough appeared before court today following his arrest on Friday in Dunfermline, Fife. He was released from prison less than a week ago. The 53-year-old gained his nickname after he trekked from Land’s End to John O'Groats wearing no clothes after leaving his job as a lorry driver. The former Royal Marine arrived at Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court in Fife in his own security van amid tight security with great care being taken to shield him from curious locals. However, as he was unloaded from the van, Mr Gough stopped and waived to the waiting photographers. The charge against Mr Gough, 53, said he conducted himself in a disorderly manner and committed a breach of the peace by walking naked in Cairncubie Road, close to the play park, and refusing to put on clothing or move away from the park. Mr Gough, from Eastleigh, Hampshire, chose to represent himself rather than be represented by the duty solicitor during his appearance at Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court in Fife, and pleaded not guilty. In the hearing, which lasted only three minutes, Mr Gough explained his refusal to be represented by citing bad past experiences. Gough has spent most of the last six years in solitary confinement at HMP Perth. He has repeatedly been arrested seconds after walking free from the jail in the city's Edinburgh Road. 'Naked Rambler' Stephen Gough has been arrested three days after being released from prison . Upon his release from maximum security Perth Prison last week he said that he planned to walk to England to see his family. Wearing just a backpack – he vowed to continue walking around Britain without any clothes on – albeit away from busy main roads. Gough celebrates reaching John O'Groats following the completion of his naked walk from Land's End in 2004 . Speaking to the Sun he said: 'It is nice to be standing here feeling the breeze. 'I haven't been outside a building in the last six years and it is nice to smell the flowers and see the greenery. Predicting his arrest he went on to say: 'I don't know what I am going . to do. I could get arrested when I go round the next corner,' before . adding: 'This is my job. This is my vocation in life at the moment. I have absolutely no regrets.' 'To conform with everyone else is the easiest way but when you conform . you compromise your principles. I am not going to give up. Stay naked is . the word.' Last August he was jailed for 657 days for breach of the peace and contempt of court. The . breach was for leaving HMP Perth naked at the end of a previous . sentence, while he was found in contempt for representing himself at the . city's sheriff court while naked. He . was arrested multiple times during his hike from Land's End to John . O'Groats which began in 2003 and served four months in Inverness Prison, . eventually reaching John O'Groats in 2004. He . returned home but on a flight back to Scotland in May 2006 he was . detained once again for a breach of the peace after he went to the . toilet and removed his clothes. At the hearing for his latest breach today he did not appeal for bail and was remanded in custody. A trial date was set for August 23, with an intermediate date on August 10.

"Seeing the Northern Lights has overtaken the Pyramids and Great Barrier Reef at the top of the typical Briton’s holiday wish list, according to a survey.The poll found that witnessing the Aurora Borealis in Norway has overtaken traditional tourist destinations to become the must-see holiday sight.The study by Travelsupermarket.com found more than half of us (54 per cent) have compiled a ‘Holiday Bucket List’ – a list of places they want to visit before they die. The Northern Lights, otherwise known as Aurora Borealis, is the new must-see destination, with 37 per cent of travellers putting it on the top of their 'holiday bucket list' Egypt's ancient Pyramids in Giza is still a top destination for holiday makers, coming second on a new poll by Travelsupermarket.com . However, one in ten of us will never tick anything off our list of holiday ambitions, and 32 per cent are resigned to visiting fewer than half of our must-see destinations. The top ten destinations are: 1, Aurora . Borealis (37 per cent);  2, Pyramids (35pc); 3, Route 66 (33pc); 4, . Great Wall of China (32pc); 5, African safari (31pc); 6, Helicopter ride . over Grand Canyon (30pc); 7, Caribbean cruise (29pc); 8, Taj Mahal .

Once-in-a-lifetime opportunities include an African safari and a helicopter ride over the Gran Canyon . Travelsupermarket’s Bob Atkinson said: ‘Ten years ago African safaris and Route 66 road trips were appealing mainly because they were perceived to be once-in-a-lifetime opportunities. ‘The world is a lot more accessible now, so we’re seeing destinations much closer to home become popular because people have decided it’s something they must see.’ 1.

"Authors Larry Young and Brian Alexander believe it is 'an . unconscious evolutionary drive... that helps to create a loving, nurturing bond between lovers' Two men have attempted to answer the age-old question, 'why are men obsessed with breasts?' Larry Young and Brian Alexander, who recently released The Chemistry Between Us: Love, Sex, and the Science of Attraction, have dissected the emotional, biological and cultural reasons behind the real reason men love breasts. The two authors believe heterosexual men are so fascinated by women's breasts thanks to a simple hormone released during nursing which helps to forge the powerful bond between mother and baby, which also creates an evolutionary drive for a strong nurturing bond between lovers. Breast obsessed: Larry Young and Brian Alexander have dissected the emotional, biological and cultural reasons behind the real reason men love breasts . Mr Young, a leading expert in the neuroscience of social bonding, wrote a column for the Huffington Post, explaining that 'biologically speaking,' the human male breast obsession is 'pretty weird'. 'Men are the only male mammals fascinated by breasts in a sexual context,' said Mr Young. 'And women are the only female mammals whose breasts become enlarged at puberty, independent of pregnancy. We are also the only species in which males caress, massage and even orally stimulate the female breasts during foreplay and sex.' He continued to say that women do enjoy attention on their breasts, after Roy Levin, of the University of Sheffield, and Cindy Meston, of the University of Texas, surveyed 301 people, which included 153 women, on breast stimulation. 'When . a partner stimulates a woman's breasts, it sparks the . same series of brain events as nursing' The results showed that stimulating the breasts or nipples enhanced sexual arousal in about 82per cent of the women, and nearly 60per cent ask to have their nipples touched, according to Mr Young. The authors cite the success of Hooters, 'men's' magazines like Playboy, and about '100,000 years of art' as obvious proof that men are 'extremely' drawn to breasts. However, the attraction is nature, not nurture, they say. 'Boys don't learn on the playground that breasts are something that . they should be interested in. It's biological and deeply engrained in . our brain,' they wrote. 'In . fact, research indicates that when we're confronted with breasts, or . even breast-related stimuli, like bras, we'll start making bad decisions . (and not just to eat at Hooters).' Evolution and hormones: The authors believe men are so fascinated by women's breasts thanks to a simple hormone released during nursing . Evolutionary biologists have suggested that because full breasts are mostly made up of fat, this signaled to a man that a woman is in good health, 'therefore a top-notch prospect to bear and raise children.' However another hypothesis is based on the idea that many primates have sex with the male entering from behind, which has been used to explain why some female monkeys 'display elaborate rear-end advertising.' Therefore in humans, it has been argued that women's breasts evolved to mimic the contours of her rear. The authors dismiss both of these ideas, instead referencing a neurological explanation that links the same brain mechanisms used to promote a powerful bond between a mother and her infant. 'When a woman gives birth, her newborn will engage in some pretty elaborate manipulations of its mother's breasts,' they wrote. 'This stimulation sends signals along nerves and into the brain. There, the signals trigger the release of a neurochemical called oxytocin from the brain's hypothalamus. 'This oxytocin release eventually stimulates smooth muscles in a woman's breasts to eject milk, making it available to her nursing baby.' They continued: 'But oxytocin release . has other effects, too. When released at the baby's instigation, the . attention of the mother focuses on her baby. The infant becomes the most . important thing in the world. Why men loves breasts: The authors of The Chemistry Between Us: Love, Sex, and the Science of Attraction have answered the eternal question . 'Oxytocin, acting in concert with dopamine, also helps imprint the newborn's face, smell and sounds in the mother's reward circuitry, making nursing and nurturing a feel-good experience, motivating her to keep doing it and forging the mother-infant bond. This bond is not only the most beautiful of all social bonds, it can also be the most enduring, lasting a lifetime.' Essentially, 'when . a partner touches, massages or nibbles a woman's breasts, it sparks the . same series of brain events as nursing,' they explained. Humans are also among the very few animals that have sex face-to-face, 'looking into each other's eyes.' The authors conclude that this 'quirk' of human sexuality has evolved to 'exploit the ancient mother-infant bonding brain circuitry as a way to help form bonds between lovers.' Because an oxytocin release focuses the brain's attention to a partner's face, smell, and voice, the authors believe that the combination of oxytocin release from breast stimulation, and the increase of dopamine from the excitement of foreplay and face-to-face sex, helps to create an 'association of the lover's face and eyes with the pleasurable feelings, building a bond in the women's brain'.Far from being creepy, the authors say, a man's fascination with breasts is 'an unconscious evolutionary drive prompting us to activate powerful bonding circuits that help create a loving, nurturing bond.'","Authors Larry Young and Brian Alexander believe it is 'an .

"Guests included Charlie Chaplin, Cary Grant, Joan Crawford, Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill . It was referred to as the 'ranch' by newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst - a rather misleading term of endearment for his 165-room castle that took 28 years to design and build. Hearst worked with architect Julia Morgan from 1919 to create the grand property in San Simeon, California. It was developed in 127 acres of land that the media magnate inherited from his wealthy family, and completed in 1947. The palatial home is nestled amid gardens, pools, terraces and walkways. Hearst made his money in newspapers and magazines before expanding into politics. He was believed to be the inspiration behind Orson Welles' film Citizen Kane. Palace paradise: The castle was built for publishing tycoon William Randolph Hearst high on a hill half way between San Francisco and Los Angeles and was completed in 1947 . He was only able to enjoy his . magnificent castle for a brief time before having to leave the remote location, several hundred miles from both San Francisco and Los Angeles, . for medical care in the same year that the property was completed. Hearst . died in Beverly Hills on August 14, 1951, at the age of 88. The castle was bequeathed to the state of California in 1957 and opened to the public. It attracts around one million visits each year thanks to its plethora of antiques and substantial art collection - despite its remote location, high on a hill overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Hearst, who ran unsuccessfully for Mayor of New York but was twice elected to the House of Representatives, officially named the estate La Cuesta Encantada, 'The Enchanted Hill'. However he lovingly dubbed it the 'ranch' because the castle was built on Rancho Piedra Blanca - land that Hearst's father, George Hearst, bought in 1865 after making his fortune in mining. California dreaming: The striking indoor Roman tiled pool at the castle is one of several that dots the 165-room property in San Simeon . A fantastic read: The Gothic study at the castle contains a large library lined with rare books which newspaper tycoon Hearst collected . William Hearst originally approached architect . Julia Morgan in 1915 with plans for a modest bungalow. The tycoon . loved the views from the estate so much but felt he had become too old . to go camping in the hills. Morgan, . who had studied at the distinguished Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, . designed more than 700 buildings in California during her long career. However she is best known for the stamp she made on what was to become . Hearst Castle. The castle and surrounding buildings are a mix of European architectural styles that appealed to Hearst on his travels. In total, Hearst Castle has 56 bedrooms, 61 bathrooms and 19 sitting rooms. There are 127 acres of manicured gardens along with numerous indoor and outdoor pools. The tiled indoor pool, for example, draws from the Roman tradition of baths and is lined with statues of gods, goddesses and heroes. Tennis courts, a movie theater, airport, wine cellar and a one-time private zoo completed the estate. While Hearst Castle was in the process of being completed in the 1920s and 30s, invitations were highly conveted by the Hollywood elite. Among the distinguished guests who graced its majestic halls were Charlie Chaplin, Cary Grant, Joan Crawford, Clark Gable, Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill. Castle in the sky: The magnificent palace has uninterrupted views to the Pacific Ocean from the Hearst family's San Simeon estate . Pastiche: Hearst Castle incorporates a mixture of historic European styles influenced by the tycoon's travels on the continent . Fountain of wealth: The estate took more than 28 years to build and was funded by William Hearst's media empire . Hearst Castle was the inspiration for . the 'Xanadu' mansion of the 1941 Orson Welles film Citizen Kane, which . was itself a fictionalization of William Randolph Hearst's life. However the castle was not used as a location for the film. One of the conditions for the property being opened up to the public was that the Hearst family were still allowed to use the estate. They reportedly continue to use the original house built on the estate in the late-19th century as a retreat. This Friday the castle will revive some of its old-school Hollywood glamour by hosting a screening of Citizen Kane at the theater in the grounds along with an exhibition from Hollywood photographer Timothy White. For added glitz, Harrison Ford is also expected to attend the public event.

"Eating raspberries could help increase the chances of becoming a father, it has been claimed. They contain high levels of Vitamin C, a key nutrient in male fertility, and magnesium, which is involved in the production of testosterone. They are also thought to protect sperm from ‘oxidative stress’. Wellbeing: Eating fresh raspberries could help boost chances of fatherhood because of their Vitamin C and antioxidants . A study by the US Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found that men over 44 with the highest intake of Vitamin C had 20 per cent less damage to their sperm DNA than men who did not eat those foods. It is also thought that after conception antioxidants may decrease the risk of miscarriage. Juliet Wilson, a fertility nutritionist, said: ‘Raspberries provide essential nutrients that are known to enhance fertility in men and women.’ A recent study in the USA found that men over 44 with the highest intake of Vitamin C - found in foods such as raspberries, broccoli and potatoes - had 20 per cent less damage to their sperm DNA than men who did not eat those foods. Help: The berries provide essential nutrients that are known to enhance fertility in men . Juliet Wilson, a leading fertility nutritionist said that one portion of raspberries provided the same amount of Vitamin C as eating 173 grapes. She said: 'Raspberries have not yet been given the 'super-food' recognition of other berries, but they have a comparable bounty of nutrients which shouldn't be ignored. 'Alongside their many health benefits, raspberries are a perfect snack for couples trying to conceive. 'Together with their high vitamin C content - one portion of raspberries provides the same amount as 173 grapes - they are also a good source of folate, which is known to be essential in key stages of female fertility and early embryo development. 'Raspberries provide essential nutrients that are known to enhance fertility in men and women.' Beneficial: Antioxidants in the fruit may decrease the risk of miscarriage . With sperm counts in the average British male falling by almost half in the past 60 years, experts have claimed raspberries maybe the saviour to help fathers-to-be. The popular fruit contain folate, a key nutrient during conception and throughout pregnancy. Juliet added that it is not just the vitamins and minerals in raspberries which are beneficial in the bedroom. The berries also help to maintain a healthy body weight, which is the key to balancing sex hormones and increasing the likelihood of conceiving. They have the lowest GI of any fruit, meaning their sugar is absorbed into the body slowly. This, combined with their high fibre content means raspberries are an effective way to control hunger and cravings at only a few calories. Nick Marston of British Summer Fruits, the body that represents 85 per cent of British berry growers, said: 'Raspberries are often overlooked, but their numerous fertility-boosting properties and antioxidants make them the perfect bedtime snack. 'This year we've had faultless growing conditions with the cool spring and recent warm weather, which have resulted in exceptionally tasty and juicy raspberries - so there's no excuse not to take advantage of this superfood.' British raspberries are in season now and available in abundance in all major supermarkets until November.","Raspberries contain very high levels of antioxidants, which protect sperm from oxidative stress .

"I get around: Neanderthals interbred with all modern humans except those from sub-Saharan Africa, a new study suggests . Sub-Saharan Africans are the only modern humans whose ancestors apparently did not interbreed with Neanderthals, new research suggests. Scientists studying human genetic ancestry have found that, like modern Eurasian peoples, modern North Africans also carry genetic traces which suggest some Neanderthal ancestry. Neanderthals were a closely related species of humans who thrived in Europe and the near East during the last Ice Age but died out around 30,000 years ago. Genetic evidence published in 2010 . suggests they interbred with the ancestors of some modern humans, with . as much as 1 to 4 per cent of modern Eurasian genomes containing . Neanderthal DNA. According to one theory, this occurred . between 80,000 and 50,000 years ago, shortly after the proto-Eurasians . emerged from Africa, while they were still one population. An alternative explanation suggests . that was an ancestral group which gave rise to both Neanderthals and . modern non-Africans which genetically split from other Africans about . 230,000 years ago and stayed separate until finally leaving Africa. To determine which scenario is more . likely scientists analysed North Africans, since some researchers have . suggested were the source of the out-of-Africa migrations that led to . humans spreading across the world. The team led by Federico Sánchez-Quinto, a palaeontologist at Barcelona's Institute of Evolutionary Biology, analysed a total of 780,000 genetic variants in 125 people from seven North African locations. They found that North African populations have a significant excess of genetic variants shared with the Neanderthal genome compared to sub-Saharan Africans - on a par to that found in non-African humans. As expected, findings showed that those North African populations whose ancestors had the most interbreeding with modern Near Eastern of European humans also had a high amount of Neanderthal ancestry, and those whose ancestors bred with sub-Saharan Africans had a lower Neanderthal signal. However, they also found certain North African populations with very little Eurasian ancestry - Tunisian Berbers and Saharawi - that also showed a strong Neanderthal signal, in some cases as high or higher than Eurasian populations. Neanderthal genetic introgression in North . African populations as a fraction of that found in Europeans: Relative . proportion of Neandertal ancestry for each population is presented as . the dark blue section of the pies on a map of North Africa. Each population is also represented as a barplot of the . different geographic genetic components; in red: North African, in blue: . Sub-Saharan, in green: European, in yellow: Near East . The researchers wrote in the . open-access journal Plos One: 'Eurasian populations are the closest to . Neandertals among modern humans, which is in agreement with previous . studies. 'Sub-Saharan . Africans are, as expected, more distant to Neandertal, whereas North . African individuals are placed between these two groups. [...] . 'It is interesting to notice that the . North African populations closer to Neandertals are populations with a . large known European or Near Eastern admixture, but also the Tunisians . that have an almost complete autochthonous North African genetic . component.' The only genetically 'pure' humans: Sub-Saharan Africans are the only human population that do not show any traces of interbreeding with Neanderthals . The results suggested that the signal . came directly from ancient mixing with Neanderthals and not with more . recent interbreeding with modern humans who carried some Neanderthal . genes. Neanderthals learned how to make jewellery and sophisticated tools from the ancestors of modern humans, a study suggests. New high precision radiocarbon dating shows that a cultural exchange may have taken place between modern humans and Neanderthals in France and Spain more than 40,000 years ago. The findings have important implications for our understanding of our long-extinct sister species. If Neanderthals made such ornaments, they must have been capable of symbolic behaviour thought to be unique to man. However, the . researchers do not believe that this mixing came from Neanderthals who . entered North Africa and made contact with the population there. 'Given that the North African autochthonous ancestry seems to be 12,000–40,000 years old, our hypothesis is that this ancestral population was descendant from the populations that first interbreed with Neandertals about ~37,000–86,000 years ago somewhere in the Middle East,' they wrote. They admit that with their current data they have not managed to completely dispense with the possibility that these Neanderthal traces may have come from some common ancestor to both humans and our extinct cousins. However, they say their findings as well as those of previous studies 'tend to favor the admixture hypothesis as the most plausible one.'

"Revelations: A government investigation has revealed half of all babies terminated for Down's syndrome are not recorded by doctors (file picture) Half of all babies aborted for Down’s . Syndrome are missing from official figures due to chaotic record-keeping . in abortion clinics, a government investigation has revealed. Doctors have broken the law by failing to keep proper records for the Department of Health on the reason for termination. Many . Down’s terminations are being wrongly recorded as ‘social’ abortions – . which make up the bulk of terminations in this country – but other . records are simply missing. The . investigation, published on the Department of Health website, shows . that in 2012 a total of 994 babies were aborted for Down’s Syndrome, . according to the independent National Down’s Syndrome Cytogenetic . Register. However, Department of Health figures recorded just 496 of these – meaning that 498 cases were classed as missing. The . investigation identified 11 of these cases as late abortions, over 24 . weeks, but in a further 107 cases the gestation of the baby was not . known. In 47 cases, abortions for Down’s Syndrome were traced in the . Department of Health figures, but other reasons had been given for the . termination. The NDSCR knows . the correct figures because hospitals alert it every time a diagnosis . of Down’s is made and it tracks cases to a birth or termination. Department of Health figures are compiled using abortion forms filled in . by doctors. The previous . year’s data, for 2011, showed only 410 records on Down’s termination . from the NDSCR could be matched by the Department of Health’s official . records, when in fact 937 Down’s terminations took place. As . a growing number of women aged 40-plus become mothers, the number of . Down’s Syndrome pregnancies is also increasing and better screening . means the majority of cases are diagnosed before birth. Under . the Abortion Act, termination of a baby with Down’s Syndrome is legal . right up to the point of delivery. Such terminations are hugely . controversial because due to medical advances, children with Down’s can . now expect to live until their fifties and sixties. Tory MP Fiona Bruce, . chairman of the recent independent parliamentary inquiry into abortion . for disability, said it was clear doctors had broken the law. ‘Worryingly, the department appears to have made no attempt to see that the law is properly enforced,’ she said. ‘We . now know that nearly half of abortions for Down’s Syndrome were . incorrectly recorded. How many doctors were referred for investigation? None. ‘Health ministers must act to restore public confidence in medical practitioners in this field.’ Probe: An investigation by the Department for Health (Skipton House, London, headquarters pictured) revealed doctors have broken the law by failing to properly record the reasons for terminations . Professor . Joan Morris, director of the NDSCR, said: ‘It has been very frustrating . that people could pick up the official figures from the Department of . Health, yet we all knew they were so inaccurate and there was no extra . guidance to anyone to point them to the correct data.’ Under . the Abortion Act a form must be completed by the doctor undertaking the . termination and sent to the Chief Medical Officer within 14 days of the . abortion. Professor Morris . said: ‘There is a form with a box to tick and there is no envelope . provided. The doctor has to find the envelope and write the correct . address on it. It is not a system designed to be easy in a busy clinical . setting.’ Paul Danon, of the Pro-Life Alliance, said: ‘We oppose . abortion on any grounds, but are particularly shocked by the . discrepancies revealed in this Department of Health analysis. ‘It was horrifying to read that 11 Down’s Syndrome abortions post 24 weeks do not even appear in the official dataset.’ A . Department of Health spokesman said: ‘Doctors have a legal duty to . report all abortions, including those due to fetal anomalies, to the . Chief Medical Officer.’ The . spokesman added that the department was working with  the Royal College . of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists to tighten up the system.","Government investigation has revealed doctors have broken the law .

"Australia and Canada have invited the UK to join an alliance of ‘like-minded’ nations to limit action on climate change. The two countries have each rolled back green policies in recent months, and want others to join them to resist a legally-binding international deal on carbon emissions.

Canada’s prime minister Stephen Harper, who withdrew his nation from . the Kyoto Protocol on climate change, Mr Abbott has moved to repeal . Australia’s carbon tax. The . British Government last night distanced itself from the . Canadian-Australian alliance, insisting it had not been approached and . was, in fact, ‘leading from the front’ on climate change. Mr . Abbott, standing alongside the Canadian leader during a visit to . Ottawa, said: ‘We think that climate change is a significant problem, . it’s not the only or even the most important problem the world faces but . it is a significant problem and it’s important every country should . take the action that it thinks is best to address emissions.’ He . said no country would ever take action that would harm its economy, . adding ‘we are just a bit more frank about that than other countries’. ‘It’s not that we don’t seek to deal with climate change,’ he said. ‘We seek to deal with it in a way that enhances our ability to create jobs and growth, this is their position.’ He said efforts are underway to form a new ‘centre-right’ alliance including Britain, as well as India and New Zealand.

"Obama has bowed to pressure, saying he intends to permit the continued sale of individual insurance plans that have been canceled because they failed to meet coverage standards under the Affordable Care Act . President Obama has changed course in mid-disaster, announcing a new policy allowing health insurance companies to keep selling the policies they have canceled by the millions as a consequence of the Affordable Care Act. 'Insurers can extend current plans that would otherwise been canceled, into 2014,' he said. The president of the health insurance industry's largest trade group, however, warned after Obama's speech that his plan 'could destabilize the market and result in higher premiums for consumers.' 'Premiums have already been set for next year based on an assumption of when consumers will be transitioning to the new marketplace,"" according to Karen Ignagni, the president of America's Health Insurance Plans. 'If now fewer younger and healthier people choose to purchase coverage in the exchange, premiums will increase and there will be fewer choices for consumers.' In his rare appearance in the White House briefing room, Obama also said he didn't know how bad the healthcare.gov website's rollout would be. The president stopped short of promising that all Americans would find it functioning normally by the Department of Health and Human Services' self-imposed Nov. 30 deadline. And he conceded for the first time that the policy cancellations are 'often' coming 'because they no longer meet the law's requirements.' Americans receiving those letters, he acknowledged, are 'understandably aggravated about it.' 'That’s something that I deeply regret,' he added later, 'because it’s scary getting a cancellation notice.' The announcement drew jeers from Republican lawmakers and unusually aggressive followup questions from reporters. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . President Barack Obama wants to 'fix' Obamacare with a sleight-of-hand exercise designed to take pressure off of his administration . It . 'doesn't even come close to fixing the problems that so many Americans . are facing right now as a result of cancelled health care plans and . skyrocketing premiums,' said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.'But . it does represent the clearest acknowledgment yet that his oft-repeated . pledge ""if you like your plan, you can keep it"" was false all along.' 'The only ""fix"" is full repeal followed by step-by-step, patient-centered reforms,' McConnell said. Texas . Republican Sen. John Cornyn declared in a statement that Americans have . had 'enough with temporary fixes and deadline extensions.' 'We . should dismantle this law, so Americans can choose the insurance plan . that works for them, not President Obama,' Cornyn said. Obama . made the announcement during a hastily called late-morning press . conference. The fix he offered will be temporary – in effect only for . 2014 – unless another course correction is offered later. 'I . completely get how upsetting this can be for Americans,' he said in . response to the wave of cancellations, 'particularly after the . assurances they got from me ... I hear you loud and clear.' House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi let the cat out of the bag Thursday, saying that Obama would offer an administrative fix and allow Americans to renew their canceled insurance plans . Unlike a Republican plan scheduled for . a vote Friday, Obama's version closes the previously canceled policies . to individuals who were not already enrolled in them. Republicans . want a retroactive fix applied to all policies that consumers hold as . of Dec. 31 of this year. They also are demanding that consumers should . be able to join existing plans held by family members. His new approach 'won't solve every problem for every person,' Obama said, 'but it's going to help a lot of people.' The . president’s proposal would also require insurers to tell consumers how . their policies fall short of compliance with the Affordable Care Act's . minimum standards. Obama's remarks were scheduled for 11:35 a.m. but started after noon. Twitter was awash with jokes about the delay. 'If you like your 11:35am speech, you can keep it,' quipped one commentator. 'Maybe Obama is late because he's waiting for the site to load first,' snarked another. Obamacare's early implementation 'has been wrought with a whole range of problems,' the president admitted when he finally made it to the podium. 'We fumbled the rollout on this health care law,' he said. But he insisted that the butt-of-jokes website has 'gotten a lot better over the last few weeks' despite problems with 'information technology procurement' that are inherent in the federal government. Obama said the flawed website rollout wasn't his fault since aides didn't tell him it was doomed to fail . Asked whether all Americans would be . able to access and use healthcare.gov by Nov. 30, Obama would only . promise that 'the majority of people who go to the website will see a . website that's working the way it's supposed to.' 'It's . not possible for me to guarantee,' he cautioned, 'that 100 per cent of . the people 100 per cent of the time going to this website will have a . seamless, smooth experience.' And he told reporters that he didn't know ahead of time how bad the launch would be. 'I was not informed directly that the website wasn't working the way it was supposed to,' he said. If his aides had warned him, Obama added, he wouldn't have been promising a smooth introduction. 'I don't think I'm stupid enough to say this is going to be as easy as shopping around on Amazon or Travelocity,' he said. But he didn't say whether the rollout would have been delayed. The administration released figures Wednesday showing that just 26,794 people nationwide enrolled in a private health plan through the online federal marketplace between Oct. 1 and Nov. 2. Anotehr 79,391 people bought plans through state-run exchange websites. And the president has come under increased . pressure to fix what Republicans have called a disastrous outcome of the . Obamacare system – a raft of new wide-ranging minimum medical insurance . requirements that most individual policies don't meet. The healthcare.gov website has been a universally acknowledged catastrophe for the Obama administration, including crashes, leaks of personal information and gibberish-spouting login pages . Sen. Mary Landrieu (L) had offered her own legislative fix, but Obama is moving forward with his own band-aid approach that doesn't require Congress to act . With insurers killing off those plans, an . estimated 5 million Americans have already received cancellation . notices, putting the lie to Obama's frequent promise that 'if you like . your plan, you can keep your plan.' Politico reported . Thursday that White House aides including Chief of Staff Denis . McDonough, will brief House Democrats on the plan Thursday after the . president speaks. Democratic . politicians, particularly senators who face tough re-election fights in . 2014, have been running for the exits in recent weeks, seeking cover as . the Obamacare system implodes . And . former President Bill Clinton made waves inside the Democratic Party . this week by insisting that Obama should keep his pledge. Clinton's . move was both a political hand grenade and a maneuver for 2016, when . his wife Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state, is eyeing a . presidential run of her own. Putting . distance between her and Obamacare will help her chances of dodging . association with the flailing program, especially since she proposed a . similar policy – the widely mocked 'Hillarycare' – during her husband's . 1990s presidency. Both Democrats and Republicans have . proposed legislative fixes to force changes in Obamacare that would let . Americans keep their insurance plans, regardless of the law's new . minimum-standards requirements. By . acting on Thursday, the White House hopes to avoid a slew of Democratic . defections to a Republican House plan scheduled for a vote Friday. But he also said he was open to working with Congress on additional fixes. The Obama administration was also reacting to a statement from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who said Thursday morning that walking back the insurance cancellations 'can be done administratively. The president will offer a proposal today, is my understanding.' Rep. Fred Upton is the face of the most aggressive Obamacare fix offered to date, short of a complete repeal . The White House has quietly talked up . instead a proposal from Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, but . House Republicans favor the much tougher measure from Michigan Rep. Fred Upton. Both plans would keep millions of Americans in private insurance plans, pulling them out of the federal health care exchanges. Upton's bill would allow insurers to keep offering the cancelled policies. Landrieu's would force them to do so. Republicans . in the House are resisting the Landrieu approach. Requiring insurers to . sell specific plans, they say, would represent the same kind of . government intervention in private commerce as the Obamacare system . brought to the table in the first place. But . the president's planned announcement may make both of them moot, since . he can enforce an administrative fix without going through Congress. During a closed-door caucus meeting on Thursday, some House Democrats insisted that they will vote for the Upton Rep. Bill in order to save their own skin in the 2014 midterm elections. Former U.S. President Bill Clinton started the fire last week by saying Obama should keep his promises . According to Politico, New Jersey Rep. Bill Pascrell said, 'I am beginning to think members of the administration haven't read the [Obamacare] bill. I am voting for Upton tomorrow.' Pennsylvania Rep. Mike Doyle said he had told the White House told the White House that 'members of Congress aren’t judged by administrative fixes; they’re judged by their voting records.' 'And people want to be on the record that we made a commitment to the American people that they could keep their insurance if they like it, and we want to fix that.' Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told a Senate committee last week that retroactively letting insurers sell canceled policies might not be effective. 'Companies are now in the market with an array of new plans,' she warned. 'Many have actually added consumer protections in the last three-and-a-half years.'","Obama will allow insurers to keep offering plans that they've already been canceling by the millions .

"A 'killer seagull' has been spotted dragging pigeons into Hyde Park's Serpentine lake and drowning them before eating the bodies. Visitors to the central London park say the hungry bird has taken to grabbing the pigeons by the neck before pulling them into the water. It is thought that the same seagull has been spotted on the banks of the Serpentine hunting pigeons and feasting on their remains for the past five years. Scroll down for video . Hunter: A 'killer seagull' has been spotted grabbing pigeons by the neck, dragging them into Hyde Park's Serpentine lake and drowning them before eating the bodies . Vicious: Visitors to the central London park say the hungry bird has taken to grabbing the pigeons by the neck before pulling them into the water . Amateur photographer Johanna van de Woestijne, 57, was walking in the park when she witnessed its dramatic hunting technique. She said: 'It was one of the most violent things I have ever seen - after it happened I felt I had witnessed a murder. 'I’ve seen him hunting pigeons on two separate days, both times he picked them off, dragged them into the lake and drowned them. 'He is easy to spot as he has a distinctive look. He is fairly squat and looks muscular, like a bodybuilder. It must be the high meat diet he’s living on.' Witness: Photographer Johanna van de Woestijne, 57, said the way the seagull killed the pigeon was 'one of the most vicious things' she had ever seen, and said it had been like watching a murder . Unusual: Bird experts have said that the behaviour is extremely unusual for lesser black-backed gulls - which usually survive on a diet of small fish, aquatic insects and crustaceans . The aggressive bird wades into a crowd of pigeons, picks out a straggler, then sprints up and seizes it by the neck. It then drags its prey into the Serpentine and drowns it before eating it with his mate. Bird experts have said that the behaviour is extremely unusual for lesser black-backed gulls - which usually survive on a diet of small fish, aquatic insects and crustaceans. Birdwatcher, Ralph Hancock, 66, said he had been observing the menacing gull in the same spot for the past five years. 'It is one of the strangest things I have ever seen a bird do,' he said. Dinner time: After drowning the pigeon in the water, the gull shares its prey with its female mate . 'This particular gull has been doing this for at least five years, and the stripped corpses of pigeons are often found on the shore of the lake.' Mr Hancock, who writes a blog about the behaviour of birds in Hyde Park, said the gull had developed its murderous technique over several years. He said: 'The gull began by dropping from the restaurant roof on pigeons flying underneath, but found this inefficient and switched to running at them on the shore. 'Gulls can’t hunt their prey like hawks, which have powerful feet that can strangle a bird even if it’s almost as large as they are. Gulls have weak little webbed feet, that is why they have to drag the bird into the water and drown it.' Distinctive: Park visitors say the bird is fairly squat and looks muscular, 'like a bodybuilder' Repeat offender: The same gull is thought to have been feasting on the pigeons for at least five years, and the stripped corpses of the birds are often found on the shore of the lake . Mr Hancock said he had not seen any other gulls in the park eating the pigeons. 'Normally when a gull has a successful feeding strategy, other gulls copy it - this is why so many gulls snatch ice cream at the beach,' he said. 'No other gull has managed to copy it here, at least not so far - the others probably aren’t powerful enough. 'The gull is male and has a mate, who is smaller - male gulls are slightly larger than females. She doesn’t take part in the killing, but comes in afterwards and they share the pigeon.'

"An Olympic runner who lived a double life as a $600-an-hour call girl in Las Vegas is planning a new memoir about her exploits on and off the track. Suzy Favor Hamilton, 46, competed for the United States in the 1992, 1996 and 2000 Olympic Games - but was living a double life offering herself up as an escort under the pseudonym Kelly Lundy. Hamilton was unmasked in 2012, and lost a host of lucrative athletic sponsorship deals with the likes of Nike and Disney. Scroll down for video . Athlete to call-girl: Hamilton, shown right in her running heydey and left more recently, competed int he Olympics - but in later years turned to prostitution . Decline: Favor Hamilton, pictured above in 1990, lost lucrative sponsorship deals which her call girl habits emerged . While working for the Haley Heston Private Collection company Favor Hamilton, a married mom, had tried to conceal her true identity. She had blurred her faces in the provocative photographs published online, and wrote in her profile that 'discretion is EXTREMELY important to me', later adding that obscuring her identity was 'essential'. Her rates were $600 for one hour, $1,000 for two, $4,000 for 12 and $6,000 for 24 hours. Her profile listed her as being 110lbs and 5' 4"", and made much of her blonde hair and blue eyes. Now, however, discretion could hardly be further from her mind after her book deal with Dey Street Books, an imprint of HaperCollins, came to light. The 320-page book, titled Fast Girl: Running from Madness, is set to hit stores in June next year. However, both she and her publishers have been silent about what exactly the book will cover - and retail listings only have the title, author, price and publisher listed. Family: Favor Hamilton said her husband Mark, left, knew she was an escort. Right, she is with her daughter . Speaking to The Smoking Gun when her sideline was revealed, Favor Hamilton, said: 'I'm owning up to what I did. I would not blame anybody except myself... Everybody in this world makes mistakes. I made a huge mistake. Huge.' In a series of Twitter posts after her escort work was disclosed, Favor Hamilton said that the paid encounters provided 'coping mechanisms' and 'escape' from a life in which she struggled with depression. Favor Hamilton, now a certified yoga instructor, recently relaunched her web site, noting that, 'I'm not about to hide in shame. I'm here, perfectly willing to remain in the public eye.' She is now a yoga instructor, who divides her time between Los Angeles and Madison, Wisconsin. Her new website, which makes no direct mention of her escort girl past, says: 'Sure, this site is designed to provide exposure for me and keep people up to date on what I have going on, but more than anything I hope it serves as a statement that I’m not about to hide in shame.

"Campaigners demanded an overhaul of Britain’s abortion laws last night after figures revealed that most doctors never meet the women whose terminations they are approving. Under the 1967 Abortion Act, no termination is supposed to go ahead unless two doctors have judged the case and decided ‘in good faith’ that it would be in the woman’s best interests. Doctors who cannot show this can be prosecuted. Revelation: Last night it emerged that in only 46 per cent of abortion cases is there a record that either of the certifying doctors has actually met the pregnant woman to make a fully-informed decision (file picture) But last night it emerged that in only 46 per cent of cases is there a record that either of the certifying doctors has actually met the pregnant woman to make a fully-informed decision. Instead, less-qualified nurses interview the applicant to decide whether an abortion would harm the woman’s physical or mental health, with the two doctors simply signing the forms later. In 2012, as many as 98,000 terminations – or 378 every working day – were given the go-ahead without any record of the doctor having met the woman. Criticism: Lord Steel, the architect of the 1967 Abortion Act, told the Daily Mail that the figures were 'regrettable' and 'against the spirit of the law' The statistics were revealed following a parliamentary question by Sir Edward Leigh, a Tory member of the Commons’ all-party pro-life group, who said: ‘These appalling figures show we have abortion on demand. ‘It’s just a farce when doctors sign off forms saying women’s mental health will be damaged when half  of the time... they don’t even  bother to see the patient.’ The Department of Health said the revelations were unacceptable and called on doctors to ensure  they approve abortions only if they have been properly investigated. But a spokesman confirmed that guidance did not force doctors to meet abortion applicants. Lord Steel, the architect of the 1967 Act, told the Daily Mail that the figures were ‘regrettable’ and ‘against the spirit of the law’. And fellow Lib Dem peer Lord Alton, who successfully campaigned for the abortion limit to be reduced to 24 weeks in the 1990s, demanded a review of the Act. ‘These figures confirm just how lightly the provisions of the 1967 Act are taken by some practitioners,’ he said. ‘Unlike other pieces of major legislation, the Abortion Act has never been reviewed. ‘With around 600 babies aborted every working day, surely it is time we looked again at how the law is implemented in order to combat the casual attitude to unborn life so clearly in evidence here.’ Last year 185,222 terminations were carried out in England and Wales amid fears that women were able to get abortion on demand. Last night Peter Saunders, chief executive of the Christian Medical Fellowship, accused the Government and police of turning a blind eye while doctors acted merely as ‘rubber stamps’. Concern: The statistics were revealed following a parliamentary question by Sir Edward Leigh (left), whom deemed them 'alarming'. Meanwhile, Lib Dem peer Lord Alton (right) has called for a review of the Act . He said: ‘It beggars belief that this . situation has been allowed to develop while the police, regulators and . parliament have effectively turned a blind eye.’ Josephine . Quintavelle, from anti-abortion group Comment on Reproductive Ethics, . said nurses did not have the expertise to decide whether a woman’s . mental or physical health would be under threat by a pregnancy. She . added: ‘The suggestion that two doctors are required to sign a . termination off does not mean two doctors in another city or two doctors . in cyberspace. 'If the Act was applied as intended, we would have nowhere near the almost 200,000 abortions a year that we have now.’ Shocking: Between 1,400 and 4,722 girls were never born because of abortions  carried out due to them being the 'wrong' sex, a study claims . Thousands of girls were never born because of abortions carried out due to them being the ‘wrong’ sex, a study claims. Between 1,400 and 4,722 girls are missing from the population through abortions on mothers who did not want girls, analysis of census figures shows. It follows the scandal last year when doctors were exposed as willing to authorise abortions purely on the grounds that the baby was female. Yesterday’s report, based on 2011 national census figures, revealed that in some areas of Britain the proportion of boys born compared to girls is much higher than the natural rate. The usual ratio is 105 boys to 100 girls born, which keeps the population in balance as boys are more likely to die in childhood. But in some areas, sex ratios reached as high as 120 boys for every 100 girls for the second child of families. Dr Christoforos Anagnostopoulos of Imperial College London, who checked the figures calculated by The Independent newspaper, said: ‘There is strong evidence that the overall gender ratio is significantly different from the background ratio among children in the UK whose parents were born in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh. A ‘conservative estimate’ for the number of missing girls was 1,400 to 4,722, he added. Gender selective abortion was ‘the only readily available explanation’ for the observed gender shift.","Doctors only meet patients in 46 per cent of abortion cases, figures reveal .

"New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has closed the polling gap with former secretary of state and first lady Hillary Clinton, after trailing her by 13 points a month ago. He now holds a 1-point lead over Mrs. Clinton in a Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll released Wednesday. That slim lead is within the margin of error, making the race a neck-and-neck affair for the first . time.When Quinnipiac polled Americans last month, . Clinton held a 49 per cent to 36 per cent lead over Christie, a . seemingly insurmountable edge in what was admittedly a far-too-early . public survey. But now all bets are off. Gaining ground: Republican New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie won re-election last week, and his newfound national name-recognition is giving him a new edge in 2016 presidential matchups . The results come as the Affordable Care Act is falling apart of the seams, and even former President Bill Clinton is saying his fellow Democrat, President Barack Obama, should honor his promise to let insured Americans keep their health care plans. Such a move would likely hobble the Obamacare system as upwards of 10 million fewer Americans would be forced to buy insurance in the public health care marketplaces. The university institute surveyed 2,545 registered voters nationwide between Nov. 6 and Nov. 11. An NBC poll released Tuesday had Christie trailing Clinton by 10 points, 44 per cent to 34 per cent, in a hypothetical 2016 matchup. But that poll sampled just 1,003 adults, and they weren't necessarily registered voters. More troublesome, NBC polled also sampled 8 per cent more Democrats than Republicans. Too big to fail? Hillary Clinton has a massive lead among other potential Democratic presidential candidates, but Chris Christie could be superwoman's kryptonite . The latest Quinnipiac poll also found that Repubilcan congressional candidates have closed another crucial gap, matching Democrats in what-if races for seats in the House of Representatives. Thirty-nine percent of voters said they would vote for the Republican House candidate in their districts, the same number who would stand with Democrats. Democrats held a 43-34 advantage on that score a month ago. There is little risk Republican will lose control of the House, but Democrats have 20 seats to defend in the Senate next year, while Republicans only have 13 incumbents up for re-election. Combinations of state-level polls indicate that if the election were held today, Republicans would pick up five seats, giving them 50 of the 100 Senate slots. Democrats would still control the chamber, however, with 48 seats plus the two independents who caucus with them.

"The Obama administration is in full damage-control mode after the Department of Health and Human Services was forced to admit Wednesday that fewer than 27,000 signed up for Obamacare health plans through the disastrous healthcare.gov as of Nov. 2. The federal government's horrible numbers come out to 744 people per state. Thirty-six states are relying on . healthcare.gov to process all their enrollments. Fourteen states plus . the District of Columbia have their own and better run healthcare exchanges. Enrollments in these brought the total signing up to 106,185. That number represents just 1.5 per cent of the 7 million the Obamacare system will need to attract by the end of March in order to take in enough money to pay for its expected financial outlays in 2014. During his daily briefing on Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney deflected questions seven separate times about the administration's expectations for enrollments by the end of November. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius doesn't have much to applaud, with dismal numbers to show for the hundreds of millions of dollars spent implementing the Affordable Care Act . Failure: The butt-of-jokes healthcare.gov website turned in worse numbers than anyone expected, registering just 27,000 people through Nov. 2 . The . 15 state-level websites, which have experienced fewer problems than the . one run by the federal government, signed up about 79,000. They are . averaging 5,267 sign-ups each. Making . matters worse, doubts still remain about what those numbers mean, since . HHS included Americans who have chosen insurance plans and put them in . virtual 'shopping carts,' but not yet paid for them. In early September the Obama administration projected that 494,620 people would sign up during October. HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told reporters on a conference call that her system is gathering steam despite the poor showing. 'Even with the issues we’ve had, the marketplace is working and people are enrolling,' she insisted. 'There is no doubt the level of interest is strong.' The administration said Wednesday that a total of 975,407 people 'have made it through the process by applying and receiving an eligibility determination, but have not yet selected a plan.' That number includes hundreds of thousands who will receive government subsidies. Last laugh: Conservatives have been calling for Obamacare's repeal for three years, and will feel vindicated now that the system's results are nowhere near what the White House and its health agencies have promised . House Energy and Commerce Committee chairman Rep. Fred Upton has proposed a rollback of Obamacare fines and requirements for anyone who has their own individual health insurance plans as of December 31 . Sebelius said last week in a Senate Finance Committee hearing that HHS expects 1 million to enroll by year's end. But House Ways and Means Committee . Chairman Dave Camp, a Michigan Republican, suggested in a statement that . the Obamacare system has little hope of recouping its losses. 'Even . if this data was an accurate picture, the administration would need to . enroll 68,000 people per day to meet their year-end goal,' he said . 'However, the website isn’t even designed to handle that much . traffic and is currently capable of only handling less than half that . much.' Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell complained that 'only in Washington could placing an item in a virtual shopping cart – without even buying it – count as a sale' 'If private businesses used that standard, online retailers would be poised to announce their best earnings season in American history,' he mocked. Most of the people who have enrolled in plans chose free Medicaid coverage or plans available through the Children's Health Insurance Program. Those options will cost taxpayers billions without putting any new money into the system through monthly insurance premiums. Nearly one-third of the nationwide enrollment numbers came from California. Success stories in Florida and Texas, which are part of the healthcare.gov portal, were just  3,571 and 2,991, respectively. Lame, wounded duck? Presdient Obama promised that Americans who liked their health plans could keep them, but more than 4 million have received cancellation letters because of his signature insurance overhaul law . Unimpressed: House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp said HHS still needs to enroll 68,000 people every day through December 31 to reach its year-end goal . Those . three states have been a key part of the administration's strategy from . the beginning, since they are home to a large plurality of the nation's . uninsured, a group that the White House sayd numbers more than 50 . million. Whistling past the graveyard? Kathleen Sebelius said last week that she still expects 1 million Americans to sign up for Obamacare coverage by Dec. 31 . The White . House as strained to keep expectations low in recent weeks, following a . chronically ill launch of the Affordable Care Act's main website. CNN analyst Gloria Borger called the healthcare.gov episode 'a complete disaster for the administration' on Wednesday. 'It's clear that they've been low-balling what to expect, and I'm not quite sure they low-balled it enough.' HHS . has promised that the site would be fully fixed and functional by the . end of November, but a report in the Washington Post today . But the White House has only assured reporters that it will work for a 'vast majority' of Americans. Americans . for Prosperity, a conservative group that has long opposed Obamacare . and mocked its rollout, said in a statement that the White House is . shading the truth, even with its lower than expected numbers. 'In the real economy, a business doesn't count sales until they've actually been paid,' said the group's president, Tim Phillips. 'The Obama administration however, is counting 106,185 Americans as having enrolled, regardless of whether they've actually purchased a product or not.' More than 4 million Americans have lost their health insurance in recent months as a result of Obamacare's new requirements covering private insurance. President Obama is under intense pressure to keep his oft-made promise that taxpayers who are happy with their existing medical insurance policies would be able to keep them. Former President Bill Clinton said this week that he thought the law should be tweaked to allow the government to keep its pledge.","Abysmal numbers will add new pressure as Republicans press for changes to the Affordable Care Act .

"Detained: Bradley Manning is escorted from the courthouse in Maryland today . Defence attorneys for Bradley Manning, the young soldier accused of leaking government secrets, revealed today that Manning, a gay soldier in the era of ‘don't ask, don't tell,’ had an alter-ego named Breanna Manning. In the pre-trial hearing, his lawyers claim gender identity disorder played a role in Manning’s mental and emotional problems that should have barred him from having access to sensitive material. They said they found medical information about female hormone treatments in Manning’s room in Baghdad. While prosecutors objected to the line of questioning, Manning’s military attorney Major Matthew Kemkes said Manning’s gender identity disorder and homosexuality was paramount, because it would show 'what was going on in my client’s mind. Manning, 24, is accused of leaking hundreds of thousands of sensitive items to the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks. The leaked secrets include Iraq and Afghanistan war logs, State Department cables and a classified military video of a 2007 American helicopter attack in Iraq that killed 11 unarmed men, including a Reuters news photographer and his driver. The Obama administration says the released information has threatened valuable military and diplomatic sources and strained America's relations with other governments. Manning's lawyers argue that much of the information that was classified by the Pentagon posed no risk. Turning the guns: The young soldier's lawyer immediately turned fire against the investigating officer - claiming the proceedings were biased against Manning . The military is conducting a hearing at an Army post outside Washington to determine whether prosecutors have enough evidence to bring Manning to trial, where he could face a term of life in prison as a traitor. An intelligence officer who worked with Manning said today that the soldier was considered to have an especially high understanding of enemy threats in Iraq and had to be trusted to keep the material he saw private. The description of Private Manning came at the beginning of the third day of the military hearing. Captain Casey Fulton testified for the prosecution that Manning had a 'top secret' security clearance, enabling him to view a wide range of classified material. None of the material posted on WikiLeaks was classified higher than 'secret'. Fulton said Manning was regarded as having a . better understanding than other analysts of enemy threats in Iraq. She . said analysts such as Manning, known as all-source analysts, were . trained to gather intelligence from a wide array of . sources. Fulton said analysts are trained not . to disclose classified information and are not allowed to burn . classified information onto CDs for personal use. But she said it was . impossible to supervise them 100 per cent of the time. 'You have to trust that they'll safeguard the material the way that they've been taught,' she said.. Accused: Bradley Manning, 24, is blamed for the largest leak of state secrets in American history . Military court: U.S. Army courtroom sketch shows a member of the prosecution team speaking during the hearing of Bradley Manning in  at Fort Meade in Maryland . Army criminal investigators described . evidence they collected that links Manning to the WikiLeaks website's . collection of U.S. military and diplomatic secrets. Among the first issues to arise on Saturday was whether Manning's sexual orientation is relevant to the case against him. The . basis for the charges Manning faces are transcripts of online chats . with a confidant-turned-government-informant in which Manning allegedly . confesses his ties to WikiLeaks and also reveals he is gay. Maj . Kemkes asked Special Agent Toni Graham, an Army criminal investigator, . whether she had talked to people who believed Manning was gay or found . evidence among his belongings relating to gender-identity disorder. The condition often is described as a mental diagnosis in which people believe they were born the wrong sex. Graham said such questions were irrelevant to the investigation. 'We already knew before we arrived that Pfc. Manning was a homosexual,' Graham said. Prosecutors objected several times to the questions. Kemkes responded that if the government can argue that Manning intended to leak secrets, 'what is going on in my client's mind is very important.' During its cross examination of Graham, Manning's defense team also sought to convince the court that not all of the material he is accused of leaking is classified. Graham, who collected evidence from Manning's living quarters and workplace, testified that among the items seized was a DVD marked 'secret' that contained a military video showing the 2007 incident in which Apache attack helicopters gunned down unarmed men in Iraq. The video was taken from the . cockpit of one the helicopters. WikiLeaks posted the video in April . 2010, sparking questions about the military's rules of engagement and whether more needed to be done to . prevent civilian casualties. The gunners can be heard laughing and . referring to the men as 'dead bastards.' Kemkes, one of Manning's lawyers, . asked Graham whether she knew the video was unclassified. She said she . didn't. 'In fact, it was an unclassified video,' Kemkes said. Emotional turmoil: Manning's lawyers say he was a gay soldier at a time when homosexuals were barred from serving openly . Although WikiLeaks had been . posting sensitive information to the Web since 2006, release of the . Apache video drew worldwide attention to the organization as it prepared . to publish secret documents on the war in Afghanistan. Manning's appearances Friday and . Saturday in the Fort Meade courtroom mark the first time he has been . seen in public after 19 months in detention. The Oklahoma native comes to court in . Army camouflage fatigues and wearing dark-rimmed glasses. Slight and . serious, he takes notes during the proceedings. An Army appeals court on Friday . rejected a defense effort to have the presiding officer, Lt. Col. Paul . Almanza, because of alleged bias. Separately, lawyers for WikiLeaks and . founder Julian Assange are asking the military's highest appeals court . to guarantee two seats in the Fort Meade courtroom. Manning's hearing is open to the . public, with limited seating. Inside the courtroom, no civilian . recording equipment is allowed. Instead of a judge, a presiding . officer delivers a recommendation as to whether prosecutors have enough . evidence to bring a suspect to trial. A military commander then makes the final decision.

"British police were said to have spent several weeks tracking the movements of Saad Al-Hilli at the start of the last Gulf War . Stationed on a driveway just yards from their target's £1million home, British police were said to have spent several weeks tracking the movements of Saad Al-Hilli at the start of the last Gulf War. Officers thought to be from Special Branch maintained constant surveillance on the aeronautical engineer and his family, regularly following Mr Al-Hilli – who fled Iraq as a boy – and his brother whenever they drove off. Last night Philip Murphy, a neighbour in the wealthy village of Claygate, Surrey, recalled how police asked if they could use his driveway to spy on the massacre victims' mock-Tudor house. The retired finance director said: 'I watched them from the window and they were watching Mr Al-Hilli and his brother. 'I thought they were from Special Branch. They would sit there all day in their parked car just looking at the house. 'When . Mr Al-Hilli came out and drove off, they would follow him. It was all . very odd. I never told the family they were being watched.' The surveillance happened as the invasion of Iraq by US and British forces began in March 2003. Any operation on the family would almost certainly have been backed up by bugging devices within their detached home. Last . night it remained unclear why a surveillance team would be sent to . watch a man who, on the outside at least, was a respected engineer. The home of murdered aeronautical engineer Saad Al Hilli, in Claygate, Surrey, was under police guard yesterday . Mr Al-Hilli, 50, a keen cyclist and . badminton player, worked on a freelance basis for a satellite and . aerospace technology company in Guildford. He . also owned a computer design company called SHTECH Ltd, which was . formed in 2001, and was the company secretary for a Wiltshire-based . aerial photography company in Swindon. The dead man's apparent family links to Saddam Hussein's ruling Ba'ath party in Iraq may be of significance. A . close friend told how Mr Al-Hilli's father Kadhim, a former factory . owner, and mother Fasiha fled Baghdad in the late 1970s. The friend told . how Mr Al-Hilli's father had fallen out with the Ba'ath party and was . forced to flee the country. It . was during this time that Saddam Hussein became powerful in Iraq before . becoming its leader in 1979. Mr Al-Hilli came to Britain as a teenager . and was educated at Pimlico comprehensive school in central London where . he took O- and A-levels, specialising in maths, physics and technical . drawing. Last night Philip Murphy, a neighbour in the wealthy village recalled how police asked if they could use his . driveway to spy on the massacre victims' mock-Tudor house . He later took a degree in mechanical engineering and a computer qualification. His CV reveals that he was comfortable with using several software packages and had a string of jobs in the engineering field for the past 20 years. He became a British citizen in 2002. Yesterday Jack Saltman, another neighbour, said Mr Al-Hilli had told how he was grappling with a 'personal problem' on August 29, the day the family left for France. 'He told me something about a problem he had,' Mr Saltman said. 'I told the police that I knew what this problem was but I still haven't been able to speak to them about it. 'I've known about it for several . months now. I knew he had family in Iraq. He did say he was worried . about their safety. He came around to see me the night before he went . and asked me to keep an eye on the house. He wasn't particularly . stressed. He was looking forward to taking the kids to France again.' Mr Saltman declined to reveal the nature of the 'personal problem'. Other neighbours in Claygate described Mr Al-Hilli as a devoted family man who 'had no enemies'. George . Aicolina said: 'This doesn't add up. He's no Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. I very much doubt the Establishment would want to get rid of him. It remains unclear why a . surveillance team would be sent to watch a man who, on the outside at . least, was a respected engineer . 'Every time I had a problem, I would go to him. He was a very clued-up person and a precise man.' Mr Al-Hilli met his future wife Ikbal ten years ago while on holiday in Dubai. The couple married a year later in Surrey. Mrs Al-Hilli, an Iraqi who trained as a dentist in Sweden, then moved into her husband's home in Claygate. There were just six people at their register office wedding in Weybridge and Mr Al-Hilli once wrote on the Friends Reunited website: 'I am very happily married with a seven-month-old daughter that has me wrapped around her little finger already.' He recently sold his beloved Suzuki Bandit motorbike, writing ruefully in the for sale advert: 'Unfortunately it has to go as it is hardly used now with kids on the scene.' Zainab was born in 2005 and attends nearby Claygate Primary School. Her younger sister Zeena was due to start in the 'reception year' of the same school next week. The family loved travelling across Europe in their caravan and were understood to own a property in the Dordogne region of south-west France. On this occasion, Mr Al-Hilli told neighbours how the family were going on a spur-of-the-moment two-week holiday to 'get some sunshine and cure his sore back'. French police guard the road to the murder scene at Cheverlaine near Annecy in the Haute-Savoie region of south-eastern France where the victims of a quadruple murder were discovered . Mr Aicolina said: 'He met his wife in Dubai. He went there on holiday and he met her there. It was a great love affair. She was Iraqi by origin but her parents live in Sweden. She was practising dentistry in the Middle East and they met by chance I think. 'They were very, very close and loved the girls very much – a happy loving family, very caring. 'He was a nice neighbour. Bad things always happen to the wrong people.' Julian Stedman, 67, who was Mr Al-Hilli's accountant, insisted his client was 'straight up'. 'I have been to the house quite a few times and had tea there, Middle Eastern style,' he said. 'I have known Saad, his wife Ikbal and his father as well. Saad and I had talks possibly once a week and longer ones once every month. Police investigate the caravan of the shooting victims at Le Solitaire du Lac camp site yesterday . 'Saad is very much a family man. He was very much in love with his wife and his daughters. He adores them. He is a very kind and gentle person. 'I have had a tremendous shock. He never talked about what he did in Iraq. 'I never thought something of this kind would happen to him and his family. I am very saddened – especially for the little girls who have been left behind. 'He was a straight-up guy. There was never any suggestion that he might be up to no good. His accounts were perfect.' Neighbour Lorna Davey added: 'It's shocking. I can't believe it. They were just like everybody else – very friendly and with two sweet little girls. The family was very westernised. There was no hint of an accent.'","Officers thought to be from Special Branch maintained constant surveillance on the aeronautical engineer and his family in 2003, said neighbour .

"Apple has already begun manufacturing the iPhone 5S, which will be revealed in April and go on sale in August, it was claimed today. The new model is believed to look identical to the current iPhone 5 but include a faster processor and updated camera, according to online reports from website iMore. It also claims that new iPad models are set to be announced in April, including a new version of the firm's hugely successful iPad Mini with an upgraded screen. Already obsolete? Two models display the Apple iPhone 5 during the product's release at a store in Taipei on December 14. An analyst has claimed production of the next iPhone 5S has begun and Apple will announce it an event in September . 'iMore has learned that Apple is planning the release of the iPhone 5S for this summer, currently for August,' the site said. 'Next generation iPads, presumably the iPad 5 and potentially the iPad mini 2, may also debut as soon as this April,' it added. 'If these plans stick, we should be in for a fun spring and summer.' It comes as Japanese Apple blog MacOtakara reported that Foxconn is starting to ramp up production of Apple's iPhone 5 successor, according to AppleInsider. It claims that because the design of the 'iPhone 5S' is substantially the same as the company's existing handset, little to no tooling is needed to manufacture the two models on the same production lines. Leaked photo? This image purports to show the . case of the new iPhone 5S. Published by French website Nowhereelese.fr, . the differences in internal attachment points suggest an update . to the latest Apple phone . The claims echo those made by Peter Misek of investment bank Jeffries earlier this year, who said Apple will begin making a new iPhone model in March for an expected launch in June or July. Mr Misek predicted that iPhone sales could begin to drop as customers anticipate the arrival of the next model, but he nonetheless said he expects around 44 million to ship in the quarter to March. 'As word of the earlier production schedule starts to spread, we believe we could see a slight slowing of demand CQ1 in anticipation of the new product launch and Apple will likely start curtailing channel inventory,' he was quoted as saying by StreetInsider. 'Therefore we tweak down our CQ1 iPhone shipment estimate from 48M to 44M, which is still well above widespread fears of shipments in the mid-30Ms.' The analyst's prediction of a summer launch date for the 5S is a reiteration of claims he made last month, when he said he expects the new phone to ship in various colours and with improved battery life. Get the camping gear ready: Eager customers queuing for an iPhone five outside the Apple Store in Covent Garden, London, when it was launched in the UK last year . On . rumours of an entry-level iPhone, Mr Misek claimed Apple could release a . low-cost device made of polycarbonate with no 4G Long Term Evolution . (LTE) capability. Apple will launch five new products in the next 12 months, including its highly anticipated TV set, two leading analysts claimed today. Analysts Gene Munster and Douglas Clinton of Piper Jaffray say the firm will launch a plethora of new products in a bid to keep its position as the world's biggest company. However, the analysts say the new gadgets could be just the beginning of a major change in Apple's products in 2014. The pair told Fortune magazine 2013 'will set the stage for bigger changes in the product lineup in 2014 and beyond.' Apple is believed to develop products several years in advance, with its design team, led by British-born Sir Jonathan Ive, producing hundreds of prototype products each year. The speculation seemed to contradict comments made by Phil Schiller, Apple's marketing chief, who recently told Chinese newspaper the Shanghai Evening News that 'despite the popularity of cheap smartphones, this well never be the future of Apple's products.' Mr Misek's predictions came as a string of analysts suggested that Apple's decision to slash orders for iPhone 5 components might not be a result of weak demand for the device. Earlier this year, MailOnline Science reported how the iconic gadget company had told suppliers it only wanted half the number of screens it had originally asked for and reduced orders for other parts too. Apple is said to have have told its suppliers about the change last month. It will apply to orders from now until the end of March and comes after Apple has come under intense pressure from Samsung and other phones which use Google’s Android operating system. But Shaw Wu, an analyst with brokers Sterne Agee, was quoted by the Telegraph as telling investors that 'as far as we can tell, iPhone 5 demand remains robust.' He added that the change in orders could be down to 'much improved yields meaning lower component builds and supplier shifts.'","iPhone 5 producer Foxconn believed to have already started production of the iPhone 5S .

"The grief stricken father of three young girls who died in tragic fire at their mother's Connecticut mansion on Christmas Day 2011 has revealed the true depth of his pain. Devastated Matthew Badger, 47, appeared on Katie Couric's afternoon talk show on Tuesday and opened up about his suicidal feelings the moment he learned of his little girl's deaths. In an emotional interview, Badger spoke of how he has been coping since the accident and how he is looking to honor the memory of Lily, nine, and seven-year-old twins Grace and Sarah who perished in the blaze at the $1.7 million home. Scroll Down for Fire . A still distraught Matthew Badger tells Katie Couric that he has had suicidal thoughts following the deaths of Lily, nine, and seven-year-old twins Grace and Sarah . 'I kept thinking, this is a nightmare,' he said, explaining how he felt after being informed of the shocking news by a policeman who came to his door on Christmas morning. 'When you are in this state you want to kill yourself, it’s absolutely natural. If your child dies on you, there is a feeling you want to go and parent them.' 'I wanted to go and be a parent to my girls wherever they went. I want to talk about the extreme emotion — you’re suicidal, you’re rageful, you just want to vanish.' During the difficult interview, Badger chocked back tears as he had to explain that despite the fire being attributed to a his ex-wife Madonna Badger and her contractor boyfriend Michael Borcina after Mr Borcina placed ashes in a paper bag in a plastic container - he held no malice. Matthew Badger sits down to talk about his ongoing grief over the death of his three girls in a fire at their mother's Connecticut mansion on Christmas Day 2011 . 'Those girls, our girls, loved her,' he said to Katie. 'I will honor my girls and that is what I’m doing with my life right now. Standing up for my girls and making their lives matter. I will never say anything bad about Madonna,' said Badger on the Katie afternoon show. Adding to his emotional testimony in front of Katie Couric's studio audience, Badger spoke lovingly and candidly of his memories of his daughters. 'Lily was the oldest and she had a personality that was very difficult to actually know who you were sitting with. She had a natural ability to be an actress,' said Badger. 'Sarah had this amazingly sunny disposition and she absolutely adored people, she was curious about everybody, she was a complete socialite. Sarah (left) Lily (center) and Grace tragically died in a fire in a Connecticut mansion on Christmas Day 2011 . Victims: The deadly fire on Christmas Day killed nine-year-old Lily and seven-year-old twins Grace and Sarah . 'Gracie on the other hand had the exact opposite disposition. She was miserable. She arrived crying and she didn't stop crying for a year. And her crying was just amazing. Because she had this scream that would just terrorise everybody. He also spoke about how he has channeled his grief into his Lily Sarah Grace Fund which is designed to help back promotion of the arts in public schools. 'Well I knew that there were these cutbacks on public education and public schools and that they were being challenged incredibly to be able to bring art back into the schools. And in a lot of the cases they had to get rid of the art teacher,' said Badger. 'And I also knew that art was considered a non essential subject, so from my own experience of what my girls went through that sounded like a terrible thing.' This comes just over a month on from an interview that Badger gave to the New York Magazine in which he admitted contemplating killing his ex-wife Madonna Badger and her contractor boyfriend Michael Borcina, who he blamed for the deaths of Lily, nine, and seven-year-old twins Grace and Sarah. His former wife's parents Lomer Johnson, 71, and his wife Pauline, 69, also perished in the blaze. Mr Badger, who lives in Manhattan, told New York magazine he was still tormented by the deaths of his children. Loss: The blaze claimed the lives of (left to right) seven-year-old twins Grace and Sarah and Lily, nine . Victims: The fire also claimed the lives of grandparents, Pauline and Lomer Johnson, pictured with the three girls (all left) He has yet to return to his job as a commercial director and went on a pilgrimage to India in October with his girlfriend where he met the Dalai Lama and cried. Afterwards, he spread some of the girls' ashes on a hill. 'Three white dogs came suddenly to sit with [us], beautiful, not mangy,' he told the magazine. Mr Badger, who wears necklace of Tibetan prayer flags, has not forgiven the man he believes responsible for the inferno which claimed five lives. He described meeting Mr Borcina in the street and refusing to hug him. After last year’s accident Mr Badger founded the Lily-Sarah-Grace Fund to support low-income schools with arts grant funding. Pain: In a heartbreaking interview last year, Madonna Badger, who lost her three children and parents in a house fire on Christmas Day, said she considered taking out the deadly ashes - but went to bed . Tears: She also recalled trying to save her daughters from the flames - and how doctors told her of their deaths . Earlier this year Mrs Badger said the paper bag of ashes did not seem dangerous as her boyfriend, Michael Borcina, had ran his hands through them. He then placed them on top of a plastic bin in a mudroom, which caught her eye as she walked up the stairs in the early hours of Christmas morning. 'I remember thinking to myself, ""I should put that outside. I should put that outside"",' Mrs Badger told the Today show. 'Then I remembered thinking, ""No, but I watched him put his hands through it"".' An hour later, she woke up choking on smoke but did not hear fire alarms sounding, despite her belief that the home, which was undergoing renovation, was installed with smoke detectors. 'It was silent,' she said. 'It was the scariest silence.' Dream home: The $1.7 million mansion was undergoing renovation and did not have activated fire alarms . Scene: The fire started after a bag of still smouldering fireplace embers were placed outside the home . She climbed out of bed and crawled to the bedroom window, hoisting herself down to the floor below as she struggled to breathe. As she looked through windows, she realised she had a horrifying decision to make. 'The windows were my mom and dad's windows,' she said. 'So I had to decide, ""Do I go in and save them? Or do I go save my children?"" And so I ran the other way to save my children.' She ran to the side of the house and climbed up scafolding to get to her daughter Grace's room. 'I opened that window and the smoke that hit me, it was just the blackest, like an ocean,' she recalled, sobbing. 'There was twirling and there was embers and all kinds of stuff in it. 'I kept trying to hold my breath and put my head in. And I couldn't get in.' Adding that she couldn't see any of the girls inside, she said: 'I'm just screaming for somebody to help me. It was the blackest smoke I've ever seen. If I could have seen them, I would have gone in. Grief: Madonna and Matthew Badger cry as one of their daughters' casket arrives for their funeral service at Saint Thomas Church in New York in 2011 . 'It's impossible to describe how it is that you can't go in and save your own children, but I couldn't get through that smoke. I couldn't.' She saw Borcina, whose eyes had burned shut, running around the yard yelling for the girls and telling them to jump to him from upper floors. She said firefighters dragged her away from the home for her safety as she howled out for her girls. 'They said I had to go right away and I begged them and begged them,' she said. 'I'm yelling at them, ""Where are my kids? Where are my babies?""' Wiping away her tears, she went on: 'Then somebody said, ""Turn off the radios! Turn off the radios!"" and then I knew that they must have - I don't know what happened. Something really bad.' Badger was taken to hospital where it took three hours for a doctor to tell her that her children had died and her parents probably would not survive. 'I said, ""Bring everybody. The children are gone, my mum and dad are gone. There's been a fire. Please come and help me"". I was just so scared,' she said. Earlier this year Mr Badger, spoke to People magazine about the moment was told of their deaths on the phone. 'It ended my life,' he said. 'I'm a father, I'm a father. I [messed] up. I wasn't there to save them.' He said that he is overcome with grief each day and the foundation is his salvation. 'If I don't cry every day, the waves are bigger,' he said. 'If I cry every day, it is less dramatic. I don't think the loss is ever going away.'","Matthew Badger gave an emotional interview to Katie Couric in which he described his continuing grief over the death of his daughters .

"OCD sufferer Emily Davies reveals extent of illness . Mental health charities have reacted with anger after discovering high street store Paperchase had been selling handwash mocking  Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). The chain - which has 130 stores across the UK - was selling a hand sanitiser called OCD which mocks sufferers. Directions for the product read: 'Open cap. Sanitize. Close cap. Open cap. Sanitize. Close cap. Make sure cap is firmly closed. Recheck cap. Are you sure it's closed?' The illness affects more than 700,000 Britons and their sufferers have branded the product 'disgusting ' and 'offensive'. Emily Davis, 21, has suffered with OCD all her life and caused a Twitter storm after discovering the product was being sold in Paperchase. 'OCD is a very serious disorder that ruins lives,' she said. 'It is a recognised mental health condition, and many people will have had personal experience of it or know someone who has. 'I feel the notion we should be able to just 'laugh off' this product is incorrect. 'This product mocks contamination OCD. Sanitiser is not inherently harmful, and is a useful tool when used correctly. But, when used incorrectly, the consequences can be terrible. I'm publishing my photo for the first time to show when my hands were at their worst because of my obsessive sanitiser use. 'I've always hidden this picture, but I'm going to be brave and share it because people need to know how serious this is. 'This product should be removed from sale. It is not being sold maliciously but out of ignorance and I want to change that.' Emily, 21, of Wimbledon, London, tweeted the image calling for it to be removed from sale and received a wave of support from fellow sufferers. Scroll down for video . Offensive 'joke' hand gel was sold in Paperchase mocking debilitating condition causing outrage . OCD sufferer Emily took to social media to highlight her disgust at the sale of the hand gel in stores . Others who found it offensive included Jessica who tweeted: 'That is really quite upsetting and offensive.' Megan Marshall added: 'As an OCD sufferer myself that is disgusting.' Another tweet from Nichola JW said: 'That's an utter disgrace, OCD is life-shattering, not a joke.' Sue Baker, director of mental health charity Mind's Time To Change campaign, said she had already expressed her concerns over the product to Paperchase. She said: 'Products that poke fun at or stigmatise people with mental health problems can cause very real harm by sending the message that conditions such as OCD are trivial and even humorous, making it harder for people affected by these issues to speak out and seek help for them.' Paperchase has now removed the product from sale but online stores, including Amazon still sell it. OCD is an anxiety disorder affecting 12 in every 1,000 people in Britain. The condition causes a person to have obsessive thoughts and to practice compulsive behaviours. Sufferers often . display repetitive behaviours alongside the need to obsessively check . thing - and hand washing is one  way the condition displays itself. They also experience unpleasant thoughts which cause anxiety. Symptoms can range from mild to severe and treatment options include cognitive behavioural therapy and antidepressants. Some people with OCD also go on to develop depression. Source: NHS Choices . It is unclear how long the store was selling it. Amazon reviews read 'great gift gag' and 'good joke value'. Mark Winstanley, CEO of Rethink Mental Illness, added: 'This product is extremely crass and insensitive and it's really disappointing that Paperchase are selling it. 'OCD is not a funny personality quirk, it is a mental illness which can be very debilitating and it affects around 1.2 per cent of the population. 'The last thing people who have the condition need to see is it trivialised in this way. 'Paperchase would never sell a product that made fun of a physical illness like diabetes or heart disease, so why should people with mental illness have to put up with it? 'Last year, Asda stopped selling a 'mental patient' fancy dress costume after a major public outcry against it. 'We're calling on Paperchase to do the right thing by withdrawing this product. 'There is already so much stigma around mental illness and 'joke' products like this only make things worse.' A spokeswoman for Paperchase said the company has now removed the product and any remaining items would be taken off the shelves immediately.

"A Florida man who once supported George Zimmerman described Wednesday a phone call he received before Zimmerman's arrest - from someone who claimed to be Zimmerman and made a 'racial comment.' Frank Taaffe described the phone call to the media, before his testimony to a federal grand jury, WFTV reported. He said a man, who he said may have been Zimmerman, made a remark that was 'something that was pretty disparaging to Trayvon (Martin) and to African-Americans' after the shooting. Mr Taaffee declined to say what the remark was. 'The alleged person that called me up to, leading up to George's arrest, was - they claimed to be George,' he said in a video filmed by the affiliate station. 'I didn't recognize the name.' Scroll down for video . George Zimmerman's ex-neighbor Frank Taaffe, pictured, has said he received a phone call from someone who claimed to be Zimmerman and made a 'racial comment' He continued, 'It came from an unknown number, so you know, I just shared with them the information with my last meeting with them in July and I can't swear that it was him, because you know, anytime someone calls you up on the phone, and says they're so-and-so, you know, someone calls you up and says it's Abraham Lincoln you know it's not him because he's dead.' Taaffe said that the phone call came from 'an unknown destination' - and when he asked the caller to state their identity, the person claimed to be 'George.' The phone call took place 'a couple of days before [Zimmerman's] arrest,' Taaffe also said. After being asked about the reasoning behind coming forward, Taaffe referenced the deaths of his sons as well as his brother. 'I just felt that it might be information that they could use to - even though it's hearsay, third party, and I cannot testify under oath that that was him, cause I can only say who that person was,' he said. Taaffe, who reportedly testified before a grand jury on Wednesday also said the remark was 'something that was pretty disparaging to Trayvon and to African-Americans' Taaffe said 'This person allegedly made a racial comment,' but told a reporter he 'can't go into that right now' and needed to give his testimony. Taaffe said he only told his now-deceased brother about the phone call, and did not inform the authorities. 'I could not establish who the person is,' he also said. 'I can't - you know, it's baseless.' He also claimed outside of the courthouse his testimony is 'an amends to the Martin family.'

"On a diet? Then consider sitting by the window the next time you eat out. A new book claims that where you sit in a restaurant can affect how many calories you consume. Slim By Design author Professor Brian Wansink, director of Cornell's Food and Brand Lab, says that those who sit at high-top tables or in well-lit areas  make healthier menu choices. It is one of a vast number of observations made by his team in a study of 27 restaurants across the U.S. Pick your table wisely: Sitting by a window in a restaurant can encourage you to make healthier menu choices . The researchers measured and mapped the layout of each restaurant and then used meal checks to track what diners ordered and how it related to where they sat. The results were telling: people sitting farthest from the front door ate the fewest salads and were 73 per cent more likely to order dessert. Those seated at a dark table or booth ate heavier food and ordered more of it, while diners seated at high-top bar tables ordered more salads and fewer desserts. 'The darker it is, the more ""invisible"" you might feel, the less easy it is to see how much you're eating and the less conspicuous or guilty you might feel,' Professor Wansink explains in the book. In contrast, 'seeing the sunlight, people or trees outside might make you more conscious of how you look, might make you think about walking or might prompt a green salad.' And if there are TV sets in the restaurant, steer clear. Professor Wansink found that the closer a table was to a screen, the more fried food the diners ordered. Another study featured in the book saw Professor Wansink's team study diners at 11 Chinese buffets across the U.S. over the course of two months. The researchers analyzed behavior, food choices, where they sit and even how food is consumed, Professor Wansink writes, and they noticed key differences in the behavior of slim diners compared with larger diners. Why it matters where you sit: Those seated at a darker table or booth ate heavier food and ordered more of it, while diners seated at high-top bar tables ordered more salads and fewer desserts . Seventy-one per cent of slim diners, for instance, 'scouted out' the buffet offerings before picking up a plate, while larger diners started serving themselves immediately. Slim diners would then cherry-pick their favorites, while larger diners would serve themselves a bit of everything. Slim By Design: The book describes 'simple actions you can take to become permanently slimmer without really working at it' Where they chose to sit varied dramatically too - 73 per cent of slim diners faced away from the buffet while overweight diners were three times more likely to sit facing the buffet. Professor Wansink believes this helped qualify their decision to go back for seconds, thirds or fourths. 'Every time they saw someone take another lap around the stir fry, it reminded them that was ""normal"" behavior,' he writes. The researchers also noted that slim diners chewed around 15 times per mouthful, three chews more than heavier diners. By eating more slowly, the diner consumes less in the time it takes for the brain to register satiety. Professor Wansink's Slim By Design theory is about changing your eating environment to lose weight. The book describes 'simple actions you can take to become permanently slimmer without really working at it.' Professor Wansink is also the author of Mindless Eating: Why We Eat More Than We Think, and was appointed by the White House as the USDA executive director in charge of dietary guidelines for 2010 and the Food Guide Pyramid.","Slim By Design advocates changing your eating environment to lose weight .

"The family of the only Ebola patient to die in the U.S. have reached a settlement with the hospital which botched his treatment for an undisclosed amount. A foundation has been set up in honor of Thomas Eric Duncan which will assist other Ebola victims in West Africa, family attorney Les Weisbrod said on Wednesday in Dallas, Texas . The foundation is part of a larger settlement from Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital that will 'take care' of Duncan's four children and his parents, the attorney said, but did not reveal how much the settlement was worth. Louise Troh, Duncan's fiancee who was quarantined at her home following his diagnosis and then struggled to find a new place to live,  will not receive anything in the settlement.

Mr Weisbrod told reporters the hospital 'wanted to do the right thing'. Details of the deal were not . released and the family will not be billed for his care, the attorney said. Hospital officials said a settlement had been reached but did not provided details. Duncan died on October 8. The Liberian man was initially sent away from the hospital's emergency room with antibiotics, something hospital administrators have acknowledged was a mistake. Texas Health has already apologized to Mr Duncan's family. Duncan's nephew, Josephus Weeks, has previously been critical of the care Duncan received, saying his death was partly due to his race, nationality and lack of insurance. Mr Duncan's fiancée, Louise Troh, (pictured) will receive nothing from his settlement . But on Wednesday, he credited Presbyterian's officials for moving quickly to settle the case and acknowledge mistakes. Mr Weeks said he will be 'the face of the foundation', which he hopes will lead to a new hospital or the dedication of a hospital wing in Liberia. 'The main focus is that Eric's name is on something and everybody knows that he didn't die in vain,' he said. Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas confirmed the creation of the foundation in a statement and said it has 'amicably addressed all matters' with Duncan's family. The hospital has apologized for releasing Duncan the first time, and after initially denying he had told them he was from West Africa, they acknowledged key caregivers missed his travel history in their record system. Duncan's sister, Mai Wureh, said that the hospital had satisfied her request for the remainder of her brother's medical records, including lab results of his treatment with the experimental drug brincidofovir. Wureh also said she and Weeks met Wednesday morning with John Mulligan, the nurse who administered the drug. 'He gave me closure because he was the last one in that room. He was able to talk to him, comfort him. He held onto him, and that made me feel better. At least he didn't die alone,' Wureh said. Mai Wureh, center, sister of Thomas Eric Duncan, smiles after she and Josephus Weeks, nephew of Duncan,  concluded a news conference in Dallas . A suit against the Dallas hospital faced long odds due to the state's regulations on malpractice suits that have made it one of the hardest places in the United States to sue over medical errors, especially those that occur in the emergency room, according to plaintiffs' lawyers and legal experts. Duncan, a Liberian national who arrived in the . United States, first sought treatment at Texas Health . Presbyterian Hospital in late September, telling staff he had . come from Liberia, one of three West African countries hit . hardest by the Ebola outbreak there. He was infected when he helped a pregnant neighbor in Monrovia seek hospital treatment . Two days after he was discharged, Duncan had to be carted . back to the same hospital by ambulance, and became the first . person in the United States to be diagnosed with the virus. He . was placed in an isolation unit and died 10 days after being . admitted, with teams of medical staff tending to his care. Two nurses who treated Duncan, Nina Pham and Amber Vinson, . both contracted Ebola and later recovered. The hospital apologized to Duncan's family for not being . able to save his life and said it made a mistake by initially . discharging him. The Ebola outbreak has killed more than 4,900 people so far . this year, most of them in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. From her home in Monrovia, Liberia, Mr Duncan's sister made an extraordinary attack on U.S. doctors in an interview with MailOnline.

Texas Health announced today that his family will be taken care of as part of the settlement . Grieving Mary Pearson claimed that the deadly virus was created as part of an experiment to infect black people on the continent - echoing the views of a race-hate preacher who says Ebola was invented to 'depopulate' Africa. America invented the Ebola virus to 'kill Africans' and deliberately left victim Duncan to die 'like a dog' in revenge for bringing the disease into the U.S, Mrs Pearson claimed. Mrs Pearson insisted that her brother did not receive the same level of care as American citizens who had contracted the disease and were taken back to the US for treatment. Of the nine people who have been treated for Ebola in the U.S., only Duncan has died and his nephew Josephus Weeks said: 'We begged. We pleaded. I even offered my own blood, even though it wouldn't do anything for him. We requested everything we could think of to save Eric. They said no.' Mrs Pearson said: 'Eric suffered in exile and it really hurts me.They didn't feel sorry for him. They didn't give him drugs. They had the means to treat him but they treated him like a dog. 'They are wicked. They didn't treat him because they said he brought Ebola to America.'

Kaci Hickox insists that she is not under quarantine and has said she is seeking time to decompress at an undisclosed location in the state. 'Going forward she does not intend to abide by the quarantine imposed by Maine officials because she is not a risk to others,' her attorney Steven Hyman said. 'She is asymptomatic and under all the protocols cannot be deemed a medical risk of being contagious to anyone.' Hickox will abide by all the self-monitoring requirements of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the state of Maine, Hyman said. Health officials in the state said on Tuesday that they're prepared to legally enforce the state's ‘voluntary’ quarantine on health care workers who've treated Ebola patients. Department of Health and Human Services Commissioner Mary Mayhew declined during a news conference to comment specifically on the case of the nurse. Scroll down for video .

President  Obama condemned New Jersey Republican Gov. Chris Christie on Tuesday. 'America in the end is not defined by fear – that's not who we are,' he said . But Mayhew said her department and the attorney general's office were prepared to take legal steps to enforce a quarantine if someone declines to cooperate. 'We do not want to have to legally enforce in-home quarantine,' she said. 'We're confident that selfless health workers who were brave enough to care for Ebola patients in a foreign country will be willing to take reasonable steps to protect residents of their own country. 'However we are willing to pursue legal authority if necessary to ensure risk is minimized for Mainers.' In Maine, a quarantine comes into play only when people have had contact with Ebola patients; others who've been to the three countries will be monitored, officials said. Hickox, who volunteered in Africa with Doctors Without Borders, was the first person forced into New Jersey's mandatory quarantine for people arriving at Newark Liberty International Airport from three West African countries. Not backing down: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, pictured on the Today show on Tuesday, has maintained that his strict quarantine rules are to protect the well-being of residents . Hickox, who spent the weekend in a quarantine tent, said she never had Ebola symptoms and tested negative in a preliminary evaluation. Both New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo have been sharply criticized for ordering mandatory quarantines. President Obama seemed to condemn Christie in a speech on Tuesday. 'America in the end is not defined by fear – that's not who we are,' the president said, calling for 'new monitoring and movement guidance that is sensible.' 'America is defined by possibility, and when we see a problem, and we see a challenge, then we fix it. We don't just react based on our fears.' Hickox, who spent the weekend in a quarantine tent in New Jersey, said she never had Ebola symptoms and tested negative in a preliminary evaluation . Obama did not mention Christie by name, but it was clear who the president was addressing as he spoke on the South Lawn of the White House. On Monday, Hickox traveled from New Jersey to Maine, where her boyfriend is a senior nursing student at the University of Maine at Fort Kent. Her boyfriend opted to leave Fort Kent to spend time with her during the quarantine period, officials said Tuesday. If Hickox were to show Ebola symptoms, then her boyfriend and any others who had contact with her also would be subject to quarantine, Mayhew said.","Kaci Hickox insists that she is not under quarantine and has said she is seeking time to decompress at an undisclosed location in Maine .

"Israeli billionaire Teddy Sagi is in talks to buy control of Reading for just £1, according to reports in his native country. Sagi, who is worth around £1.5billion according to Forbes, would pay off the club's debt, which amounted to £38million when they were relegated from the Premier League last June. The debt has probably risen significantly during their Championship campaign that saw Reading finish seventh and miss out on the play-offs on the last day of the season. Big spender: Israeli businessman Teddy Sagi, pictured here with his former girlfriend Bar Refaeli, is interested in buying a controlling stake in Reading . Room for improvement: Jordan Obita and his Reading team-mates just missed out on the play-offs last season . They think it's mall over: Sagi plans to build a shopping centre on the Madjeski Stadium car park . Sagi was spotted flying into the Madejski Stadium last week in his helicopter. The Israeli is a Chelsea fan with a corporate box at Stamford Bridge and if the acquisition goes ahead, Reading appears to be a real estate opportunity as much as the adoption of a new club to support. Sagi's bid includes plans to build a shopping centre and hotel in the Madejski Stadium car park and a housing development on Reading's Hogwood Park training ground. The Israeli made his fortune through Playtech Corp, which provides the software for bookmakers' websites and gambling machines, and earlier this year he bought Camden Market for £400m. Reading's current owners Anton Zingarevich (51 per cent) and Sir John Madejski (49 per cent) reportedly prefer Sagi's offer over that of Indian businessman Mohit Burman because of his strong business connections in the UK and his 'deep pockets.' Investment: Reading defender Alex Pearce could be joined by a plenty of new faces if Sagi's takeover succeeds . Moving on? Sir John Madejski currently owns a 49 per cent share of the Championship club . 'Deep pockets': Reading owner Anton Zingarevich (left) and chairman Sir John Madejski, posing with the Championship trophy in 2012, would prefer Sagi's bid . In the market: Sagi bought Camden Market in north London for £400m earlier this year . Indications are that while Sagi would buy control of the club, Zingarevich and Madejski would stay on as minority shareholders. Reading are being pressed to pay HMRC £3.2m in taxes, adding urgency to the sale talks. Sagi, 41, is a colourful character who once dated Israeli supermodel Bar Refaeli and his partner of the past four years is Yael Nizri, a former Miss Israel.","Sagi could buy control of Reading for just £1 .

"More than 20,000 inmates of North Korea's notorious Camp No 22 are feared to have perished during the regime's recent closure of brutal facility. The Committee for Human Rights in North Korea (HRNK) claims the prisoners - most of whom have never committed a crime - may have been allowed to die of disease or starvation in the run-up to the camp's closure last year. The organisation's latest report, North Korea's Hidden Gulag: Interpreting Reports of Changes in the Prison Camps, says the prison population shrank dramatically in the months leading up to December. Brutal: Prisoners were often worked to death at the notorious gulag Camp 22 in North Korea . Missing: Thousands of prisoners are unaccounted for after Camp 22 was closed by Kim Jong-Un . According to a report on the Telegraph's website, defectors . of the regime revealed about 8,000 of the 30,000 prisoners may have been . transferred to other camps, leaving 22,000 unaccounted for. The prisoners who survived are believed to have moved to Camp 25 near Chongjin City or to North Hamgyeong Province's . Camp 16, about which virtually nothing is known. The closure came as North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un consolidated his grip on power following the death of his father in 2011, Kim Jong-Ill. Now the HRNK has called for an inquiry into their fate. The report stated: 'North . Korea's 2009 currency devaluation (whereby camp authorities were . reportedly unable to purchase food in markets to supplement the crops . grown in the camps), combined with bad harvests, resulted in the death . of large numbers of prisoners after 2010,' the report states. 'If even remotely accurate, this is an atrocity requiring much closer investigation.' While the report covers all of North Korea's gulags, it focuses a large part of its attention on the situation in Camp 22. Intelligence: Human rights campaigners glean evidence of Camp 22 through satellite images . Secrecy: Camp 22 was believed to have been located in the North East of the country on the Chinese border . HRNK spoke to defectors, including former guards, and occasional camp survivors to compile the report. It also used satellite images. Camp 22 is believed to sprawl across 770 square miles, making it larger than London. HRNK estimates even after the closures of two camps, about 130,000 people are still being held in labour colonies across the country. The report stated: 'Through this vast system of unlawful imprisonment, the North Korean regime isolates, banishes, punishes and executes those suspected of being disloyal to the regime. 'They are deemed ""wrong-thinkers"", ""wrong-doers"", or those who have acquired ""wrong-knowledge"" or have engaged in ""wrong-associations"".' The report added: 'North Korea denies access to the camps to outsiders, whether human rights investigators, scholars, or international media and severely restricts the circulation of information across its borders.' Brutal: The new leader closed camps to consolidate his grip after the death of Kim Jong-Ill (pictured) Few prisoners ever make it out to tell the tale. Those who have paint a bleak picture of life on the inside. Inmates . can be imprisoned for life along with three generations of their . families. They are forced to survive by eating frogs, rats and picking . corn kernels out of animal waste. Human rights activists estimate 40 per cent of inmates die of malnutrition, while others succumb to disease. They face abuse by guards, torture, sexual violence and can even be worked to death. Those caught attempting to escape are executed. Roberta Cohen, co-chairman of HRNK, called for the International Red Cross to be granted access to the camps as soon as possible. She said: 'An accounting of the fate and whereabouts of all of North Korea's political prisoners, including those missing and those who have died in detention, should be of highest priority to the UN commission of inquiry and the entire international community.' Stalinist: There was a national outpouring of grief when Kim Jong-Un died, while thousands languished in jail .","Thousands of prisoners are missing after the closure of brutal Camp 22 .
New report claims many either died of starvation or disease last year .
