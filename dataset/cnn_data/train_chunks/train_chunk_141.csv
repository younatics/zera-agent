"Washington (CNN) -- When Chris Christie praises President Barack Obama as ""outstanding"" and ""incredibly supportive,"" you know something extraordinary has occurred. Obama updated on Sandy; praised by Christie . In this case, it was once-in-a-lifetime Superstorm Sandy, which caused the outspoken Republican governor of New Jersey to declare a state of emergency and seek federal help for widespread devastation. Interviewed Tuesday on NBC, Christie described Obama's response as ""outstanding,"" and he told CNN that the president had been ""incredibly supportive and helpful to our state."" ""This is much more important than any election,"" Christie told CNN's ""Piers Morgan Tonight."" Obama has ""been outstanding to deal with on this and I look forward to seeing him tomorrow so he can see for himself what this hurricane has done to my state,"" Christie said Tuesday night. Such effusive praise from a frequent Obama critic and strong supporter of Republican presidential challenger Mitt Romney put the campaign magnifying glass on a key election issue -- the role of the federal government -- a week before the November 6 vote. Photos: Aftermath of Superstorm Sandy . It also focused attention on how Romney would handle such a disaster if he were to defeat Obama in what is expected to be a very close election. On Tuesday, the GOP candidate showed little inclination to address the matter. At a campaign event changed to a storm relief effort in Ohio, Romney ignored shouted questions by reporters on whether he supported the Federal Emergency Management Agency's role in disaster relief. Instead, he focused his remarks to supporters who donated relief supplies for storm victims on how such efforts contribute to meeting the overall need. ""We won't be able to solve all the problems with our effort this morning,"" Romney said, adding ""one of the things you learn in life is you make the difference you can, and you can't always solve all the problems yourself."" Romney on storm aftermath: 'People are hurting' Democratic critics of Romney and his running mate -- conservative House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin -- argue their proposals to cut government spending and provide broad tax cuts without generating more government revenue will end up harming the economy and increasing the federal deficit. Photos: New York recovers from Sandy . In particular, the Obama campaign challenges Romney's contention that increased economic growth from the tax cuts combined with shifting current federal responsibilities to states, the private sector and humanitarian agencies and charities can balance the budget. Last year, Romney argued at a Republican presidential debate in New Hampshire that cutting federal spending should be based on prioritizing what is absolutely necessary and shedding the rest. Asked by moderator John King of CNN if disaster relief efforts should be turned over to states, Romney said that ""every time you have an occasion to take something from the federal government and send it back to the states, that's the right direction. And if you can go even further and send it back to the private sector, that's even better."" ""Instead of thinking in the federal budget, what we should cut -- we should ask ourselves the opposite question. What should we keep?"" Romney added. ""We should take all of what we're doing at the federal level and say, what are the things we're doing that we don't have to do? And those things we've got to stop doing, because we're borrowing $1.6 trillion more this year than we're taking in."" King cut in to ask if Romney was referring specifically to disaster relief, a topic in the news at the time following a deadly Joplin, Missouri, tornado, and Romney continued: ""We cannot afford to do those things without jeopardizing the future for our kids. It is simply immoral, in my view, for us to continue to rack up larger and larger debts and pass them on to our kids, knowing full well that we'll all be dead and gone before it's paid off. It makes no sense at all."" Romney: States should handle emergency management . With then-Hurricane Sandy bearing down on the East Coast on Monday, Romney's debate comments from 16 months earlier became a topic of political discussion, and the Romney campaign issued a statement in response. Sandy reminds us of climate change and other forgotten campaign issues . ""Gov. Romney believes that states should be in charge of emergency management in responding to storms and other natural disasters in their jurisdictions,"" said the statement by spokeswoman Amanda Henneberg. ""As the first responders, states are in the best position to aid affected individuals and communities, and to direct resources and assistance to where they are needed most. This includes help from the federal government and FEMA."" Henneberg added another sentence to the statement Tuesday, saying that ""a Romney-Ryan administration will always ensure that disaster funding is there for those in need. Period."" Opinion: Sandy shows why we need FEMA . Craig Fugate, administrator of the emergency management agency, told reporters Tuesday that the agency had $3.6 billion remaining in its disaster relief fund. The agency works with state and local authorities as well as the American Red Cross and other agencies to help disaster victims rent temporary housing, repair their homes, get loans to cover small business and farm losses, as well as assisting in cleaning up storm debris including hazardous materials. Vice President Joe Biden, meanwhile, said Tuesday that the federal response to Sandy was ""working like it's supposed to,"" and he highlighted to reporters in Ohio what he described as unprecedented cooperation between city, state and federal authorities and agencies. A White House statement also emphasized such cooperation, noting Obama spoke by phone with a host of Republican and Democratic governors and mayors from states affected by the storm. Sandy's impact: State by state . Romney has made political dysfunction in Washington a target of his campaign, blaming Obama for what he calls failed leadership in being unable to forge a deficit reduction deal with Republicans. Democrats blame Republicans for what they contend has been an unwillingness to compromise, and the focus on cooperation Tuesday by Obama and Biden appeared to be aimed in part at demonstrating the administration's ability to get things done. The question of the size and scope of the federal government is at the heart of both campaigns. Obama and Democrats argue that entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid are vital to the social contract to provide contributing citizens with basic needs, and that government also has a role to play in education and technological development while providing services such as national defense and disaster relief. Opinion: Sandy debunks 'nanny state' Republicans, driven by the party's conservative wing, call for immediate steps to erase the chronic budget deficits and mounting federal debt that they say imperil national security and stability. They want to shrink the size of government and reduce taxes while reforming entitlements by partial privatization, reducing and delaying some benefits and other steps. Sensitive issues such as disaster relief generally play to the advantage of Democrats and their support for government benefits, especially in a time of crisis when images of suffering victims dominate the airwaves. Superstorm Sandy breaks records . Obama has avoided any direct political talk in recent days as the huge storm approached the Eastern seaboard, canceling campaign events and focusing his attention on the administration's response. In statements Monday and Tuesday on the storm and its aftermath, he emphasized the need for a collective response while also making sure to point out the federal role in relief efforts. ""We've been able to get over 1,000 FEMA officials in place, pre-positioned,"" the president said. ""We've been able to get supplies, food, medicine, water, emergency generators, to ensure that hospitals and law enforcement offices are able to stay up and running as they are out there responding."" He also sounded a main campaign theme by ensuring those hit hardest by the storm that his administration and the entire nation were with them. ""This is a tough time for millions of folks across the Eastern seaboard, but America is tougher and we are tougher because we pull together, we don't leave anybody behind, we make sure that we respond as a nation,"" Obama said. Obama visits Red Cross: 'Storm is not yet over' At about the same time he spoke, the White House announced that Obama will travel to New Jersey on Wednesday ""where he will join Gov. Christie in viewing the storm damage, talking with citizens who are recovering from the storm and thanking first responders who put their lives at risk to protect their communities."" While the president and one of Romney's top supporters will be photographed together responding to disaster, Romney is scheduled to be in Florida for three campaign events.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- As residents of the U.S. Northeast grapple with the destruction wrought by Superstorm Sandy, an offer of assistance has come from an unlikely quarter: the leader of a radical Muslim group in Pakistan that Washington has branded a terrorist group. ""We offer our unconditional support and help for the victims"" of the storm, Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, head of the Islamic charity Jamaat-ud-Dawa, said in a statement late Tuesday. ""If U.S. government allows, we will send our doctors, relief and rescue experts, food and medicine on humanitarian grounds."" India accuses Saeed of masterminding the 2008 terrorist assault on Mumbai that killed 166 people -- an allegation he denies. The United States, which has declared Jamaat-ud-Dawa a terrorist organization and put up a $10 million reward for information leading to Saeed's arrest and conviction, declined the offer. ""While we have great respect for Islamic tradition of social assistance to those who are in need no matter where they might be, this particular offer strikes us as very hollow,"" State Department spokesman Mark Toner told reporters Wednesday. Is Sandy a taste of things to come? Saeed said in the statement posted on Jamaat-ud-Dawa's Facebook page Tuesday that despite the bounty and U.S. allegations about his organization, helping Americans struck by adversity is ""our religious and moral obligation."" ""Islam orders us to help them without discriminating between religion, cast or creed,"" he said in the statement, which was set against the backdrop of an apparently fabricated image of a scuba diver swimming through a submerged Times Square subway station. His organization said on its Twitter account that it had previously carried out relief efforts following natural disasters in Sri Lanka and Indonesia. Sandy's impact: State by state . The ""wanted"" notice for Saeed issued by the State Department's Rewards for Justice program in April described him as a former professor of Arabic and engineering who helped found Jamaat-ud-Dawa, which aims to bring about Islamist rule in India and Pakistan. The group's military wing, Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, which means army of the pure, is blamed for violence in the disputed territory of Kashmir aimed at liberating Muslims. After the September 11, 2001, attacks in the United States, Lashkar-e-Tayyiba began operating outside Kashmir. It is suspected of carrying out several high-profile attacks in India in the past few years. How you can help storm victims . The United States labeled it a ""foreign terrorist organization"" in December 2001, and under pressure from Washington, Pakistan banned it in 2002. But the group continues to function freely. After the U.S. government announced the reward for his capture in April, Saeed appeared on Pakistani television and seemed unruffled by the move. ""I am living my life in the open and the U.S. can contact me whenever they want,"" he said. Saeed said the Pakistani Supreme Court had cleared him and his organization of wrongdoing in relation to the Mumbai attacks in which gunmen stormed locations throughout Mumbai, killing scores of people and taking hostages. Six American citizens were killed in the carnage. ""The U.S. government is listening to the Indian lobby and not making its own decisions,"" Saeed said regarding the allegations against him. He condemned the Mumbai attacks. Pakistani authorities have refused to take him into custody, saying they haven't received ""concrete evidence"" against him. The Indian government has issued a notice with Interpol against Saeed in relation to his alleged role in the attacks. India accuses him of participating in the training of the gunmen in the Mumbai attack and has charged him in absentia. Saeed has not been indicted in the United States, but the Treasury Department designated him and three other Lashkar-e-Tayyiba leaders as terrorists in 2008. It froze their assets in the United States and prohibited Americans from doing any business with them.

"(CNN) -- A toddler shot and killed his mother, the boy's father told South Florida police, who say they will talk to the 2-1/2-year-old. The father, who called 911, told police he was trying to take the firearm away from the child when it discharged. The boy's mother -- Julia Bennett, 33 -- was shot once in the back and died from the injury, said Miramar Police spokeswoman Tania Rues. ""What we do know is that last Wednesday, shortly after 7 o'clock, we received a 911 call from a gentleman stating that his 2-1/2-year-old son accidentally shot his mother -- the boy's mother,"" Rues told HLN's Vinnie Politan. Rues said investigators will talk to the toddler about the shooting, but that ""due to the age, we're not expecting to get much."" The boy's father has not been identified by police. They said he has cooperated fully with the investigation, which started with a 911 call he placed on April 20. In that roughly 4-1/2-minute call, a man's voice can be heard asking the dispatcher what to do. He speaks with a thick accent and seems overcome with emotion as he tries to explain what happened. ""My son picked it up and I tried to grab it,"" the man said about the gun. ""Oh God, I can't believe this."" Rues said the State Attorney's office will decide whether to file charges. The boy's father could face charges of negligence, she said. Bennett and the boy's father were not married and did not live together at the time of her death, according to Rues. ""This should serve as a reminder to all parents out there to not leave firearms accessible to children. Even if you believe the firearm is not loaded, it's just not smart. It's not safe,"" she said.","Julia Bennett, 33, was shot once in the back and died .

"(CNN) -- Samsung plans to challenge a U.S. court ruling that recommends more than $1 billion in damages to Apple over a patent dispute. A federal jury recommended Friday that Apple be awarded the damages after finding Samsung guilty of ""willful"" violations of a number of Apple's patents in the creation of its own mobile products. In a statement, Samsung said it will ""move immediately to file post-verdict motions to overturn this decision in this court, and if we are not successful, we will appeal this decision to the court of appeals."" The jury did not recommend awarding Samsung any money in its counterclaims that Apple had violated some of its patents. ""This is a huge win for Apple,"" Mark Lemley, a Stanford law professor, said in an e-mail. The award ""is just large enough to make it the largest surviving patent verdict in history."" In aftermarket trading, Apple stock jumped more than $12 a share, to more than $675 a share. Samsung said the verdict should be viewed ""as a loss for the American consumer."" CNN Money: What the Apple-Samsung verdict means for your smartphone . ""It will lead to fewer choices, less innovation, and potentially higher prices,"" the company said in a statement. ""It is unfortunate that patent law can be manipulated to give one company a monopoly over rectangles with rounded corners, or technology that is being improved every day by Samsung and other companies. ""Consumers have the right to choices, and they know what they are buying when they purchase Samsung products. This is not the final word in this case or in battles being waged in courts and tribunals around the world, some of which have already rejected many of Apple's claims. Samsung will continue to innovate and offer choices for the consumer."" Apple praised the court for ""sending a loud and clear message that stealing isn't right."" ""The mountain of evidence presented during the trial showed that Samsung's copying went far deeper than even we knew,"" the company said in a statement. An issue still to be decided is whether to grant injunctions that could prevent Samsung from selling products that infringe on Apple's patents. Judge Lucy Koh wanted both sides to be ready for a hearing on the matter in two weeks, but Samsung's team argued that wasn't enough time. A hearing was scheduled for September 20. Apple had asked for $2.7 billion in damages, claiming that Samsung ""ripped off"" its iPad and iPhone designs. Samsung countersued Apple for infringing on five of its patents and asked for $519 million. A nine-person jury spent two and a half days puzzling out its final verdict. Jury members used weeks of notes and memories of testimony, 109 pages of jury instructions, and boxes of evidence, including a collection of contested smartphones and tablets as their guide. The jurors had to complete a complicated 20-page verdict form filled with charts and yes or no answers to determine exactly which device violated what patents and which companies were responsible. Finally, they had to calculate the final damages amounts. Each side was given 30 minutes to go over the form and search for inconsistencies. Judge Koh and Samsung spotted a problem with the damages amount for a Galaxy Tab model. After being sent back to the jury for reconsideration, the total amount of damages was bumped down by about $2.5 million, to $1,049,343,540. After the trial was over, all nine jurors opted to leave through a back door of the courthouse to avoid speaking with the mass of reporters waiting at the front entrance. The lawsuit is the largest yet in the ongoing worldwide patent brawl between the two companies, which itself is just one battle in Apple's war against Google's Android mobile operating system. On August 24, a South Korean court found that both parties had infringed on each other's patents, banning the sale of the iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, two iPad models and Samsung's Galaxy S2. The Korean court ordered Apple to pay Samsung $35,000 and Samsung to pay Apple $22,000. 19 incredible Apple secrets revealed in court . CNN's Heather Kelly, John D.

"(CNN) -- I spent much of Sunday in touch with a group of fellow researchers. Like myself, they are college professors who are interested in understanding how people respond to weather and climate. When we recognized last week that Hurricane Sandy was likely to make landfall rather than turning out to sea, we decided to conduct a telephone survey. On Friday, we began asking East Coast residents how likely they thought the storm was to strike, how dangerous it would be, and what steps they were taking to protect themselves from the storm. We are curious to see how well they could sort out the multiple threats -- wind, storm surge, heavy rain. We will not know the full results of our work for weeks, when we have processed the interviews, which are still under way as I write. But our initial impressions are that a number of people still focus on the features of hurricanes that were emphasized decades in the past, particularly the specific path of the storm's eye and the speed of the winds. They do not adequately appreciate that a storm can be violently destructive hundreds of miles from its center, and that it can bring damage from threats other than wind -- threats that are particularly serious for Sandy. The scientific understanding of hurricanes has not yet been fully translated into public understanding. Opinion: As Sandy descends, tips from Katrina survivors . I did have some time for breaks, though, on this Sunday of work. In the morning, I went to the gym, where television screens gave details about the evacuations in low-lying areas and alerted people to the closure of the subways that evening. After lunch, I went to pick up some additional food. The pedestrians in my neighborhood were not strolling leisurely, but rather hurrying to supermarkets and drugstores, or walking back home, with heavy bags of supplies. In the mid-afternoon, after a round of e-mails to colleagues, my wife and I decided to take a walk through the park in our neighborhood, before the mandatory closing at 5 p.m. went into effect. We knew that we might not be able to go outside for a day or two. Here, too, there were fewer people strolling than usual. The gray sky and strong breezes might have frightened off or discouraged some of the ones who were done with their preparations. The park was occupied largely by dog walkers, who recognized that their pets would soon be confined to their apartments. Sandy could bring 'catastrophe,' affect 60 million . We paused at an overlook with a view west to the Hudson River, and saw ships heading north, seeking safe waters. In the open waters off Long Island, waves are projected to reach 40 feet or higher, and even in New York Bay they might crest at five or six feet. Conditions would be calmer further upstream. What impressed me was the large size of the wakes that the ships made as they rushed against the outgoing tide. The ships that travel upriver usually wait for an incoming tide to carry them. But these ships could afford no delay. As we turned to leave the park, I looked back at the river, still ebbing rapidly. I knew that the tides would turn and the storm arrive in full fury. And I thought of the most vulnerable structure in Manhattan, the sea wall at the southern tip of the island. This wall, which protects the city's subways from flooding, is nine feet high, usually a firm bulwark. But it faces three forces that bring waters higher. The tides are the first, and the second is the water pushed coastward by storms. The third is climate change. Throughout the 20th century, sea levels were rising as a result of the warming of the oceans and the melting of ice in glaciers. This rise, which varies from place to place depending on patterns of wind and ocean currents, has been about a foot in the New York harbor. Opinion: How Sandy will test Obama, Romney . When this foot is added to the four feet of the high tides at the full moon, it reaches five feet, more than half the height of the sea wall. Sandy's relentless winds have been pushing water in front of the storm as it approaches the coast; this storm surge will be heightened by the configuration of the coast at New York. If it exceeds four feet, the subways will flood, disrupting transportation for days or weeks, and causing billions of dollars of damage. Last year, Hurricane Irene also arrived at a time of especially high tides, and its storm surge came within inches of flooding the sea well. Storms and tides are natural, but sea level rise is not. As it continues, New York grows more vulnerable. Every coastal city does. The ships could sail north up the Hudson to escape danger, but sea walls and the subways are fixed in space. Governments, media and communities spring into action with the immediate threat of a hurricane, taking steps to prepare and to reduce harm. They issue warnings, remind people to obtain supplies, close parks and subways, open shelters, and organize evacuations. Will they take the larger and more difficult actions to protect themselves from the slower, and far greater, threat of climate change? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ben Orlove.","Ben Orlove: Some people still look at hurricanes through an outdated perspective .

"(Rolling Stone) -- After half a century of hits, addictions, mayhem and enough bad blood to flood the Thames, the Rolling Stones have gotten it together just in time to celebrate their latest anniversary onstage. ""To keep a band together this long, let alone a rock 'n' roll band, is probably unique in musical history,"" says Keith Richards. ""After all, that's what I was born for: to make musical history."" What the Stones have announced so far is not quite a tour: They're playing four shows this year, on November 25th and 29th at London's O2 arena, and on December 13th and 15th at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey. But Richards doubts they'll end there. ""My experience with the Rolling Stones,"" he says, ""is that once the juggernaut starts rolling, it ain't gonna stop. So without sort of saying definitely yes -- yeah. We ain't doing all this for four gigs!"" Rare and Intimate Pictures of the Rolling Stones . The Stones expect former guitarist Mick Taylor (who quit in 1974) and founding bassist Bill Wyman (gone since '93) to come on board for the four shows, but only as guests on a few songs. Richards emphasizes that longtime touring bassist Darryl Jones isn't going anywhere. ""Darryl doesn't get enough recognition,"" says Richards. ""He and Bill can talk about songs they want to step in and out of."" For the final show in Newark (to be broadcast live on pay-per-view), more guests are likely to pop by -- Ron Wood drops names like Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck as possibilities. The band shrugs off grumbling about the $800-plus it's charging for the best tickets. ""As Keith said, 'Sounds about right,'"" says Wood. ""I'd pay it! We already spent, like, a million on rehearsing, and we're not even halfway through. And the stage is going to cost millions and millions."" The Stones also have a new career-spanning documentary, ""Crossfire Hurricane,"" directed by Brett Morgen, that debuts on HBO on November 15th. In less than two hours, the film races through history from the band's earliest shows at the Marquee Club to the arrival of Wood, keeping a relatively light tone throughout. ""I never wanted to make a nostalgic movie,"" says Jagger. ""It's got to be kind of irreverent."" One prerequisite for the Rolling Stones' reunion was an apology from Richards to Jagger for the stream of insults the guitarist included in ""Life,"" his bestselling 2011 memoir. ""He did apologize, to my face,"" says Jagger quietly. ""So you have to put all that sort of stuff away. Water under the bridge, really. Hopefully, you know, we can carry on working."" Adds Richards, ""It was something to get out of the bloody way so we could get the band on the road. You know, I'll say sorry to God if you like. I don't give a shit. I said, 'Look forward, brother, look forward.' If you was married to somebody for 50 years, you can have your little spats here and there, and we don't mind having them in public occasionally. We can't get divorced -- we're doing it for the kids!"" The Rolling Stones' Album Guide: The Good, the Great and the 'Angie' ""Doom and Gloom,"" the newly recorded single from the band's latest greatest-hits collection, ""GRRR!,"" sounds more or less like classic Stones, albeit with modern production tweaks. But that doesn't mean that Jagger and Richards have revived their songwriting partnership quite yet. The song began as a demo that Jagger made on his own, and even the opening guitar riff turns out to be Jagger playing, not Richards. ""I don't give a damn,"" says Richards. ""He'd never have learned how to play that without me teaching him how to do it."" Another factor in the long hiatus since the 2007 finale of the Bigger Bang tour was Wood's struggle with alcohol addiction. He's now in his third year of sobriety, and he expects to keep it up on the road, though previous tours were always a challenge. ""Looking back,"" says Wood, ""there was always that secret vodka, like the one before I'd go onstage. Which was never just one, anyway."" Richards is also drinking significantly less. ""I don't get ridiculous,"" he says. ""I like a glass of wine with my meal and everything, but I've given up sort of waking up and having a drink, you know? I gave up smack, I can give up anything. No big deal to me, I do it to impress other people. But if they come up with a great new drug, I'll be the first one on it, believe me."" Richards argues that his substance use, or lack thereof, has little effect on his playing, but Wood disagrees. ""Keith is a pleasure to play with now,"" Wood says. ""It was a pain on the last tour toward the end, because he was really going for it on the drinking and denial. But now he's realized that he has gotta look after himself."" Since Richards isn't completely sober, Wood is inclined to keep an eye on him. ""I'm not going to preach to him,"" he says. ""I will step in if I see any danger."" The Stones seem genuinely excited about their recent rehearsals in Paris, which have included rarely played songs such as the Lennon-McCartney-penned ""I Wanna Be Your Man"" and the Aftermath ballad ""Lady Jane."" ""Going in, one thinks, 'Oh, my Christ, I'm a doddering old man,'"" says Richards. ""But it's not true! The payoff from the energy that's been wound up over the five years is incredible."" For Jagger, performing with the Stones means living up to a reputation as an ageless physical marvel, which he insists is highly exaggerated. Rolling Stones Confirm 50th Anniversary Concerts . ""Everyone's human,"" he says, ""and you can't really expect it to last forever. On the other hand, you try to keep yourself in shape. Obviously you can't do the same things [onstage] you did when you were 19, so you have to do other things. There's no miracles in life."" But he knows that fans expect him to somehow be an exception: ""It's a bit of a burden, really, isn't it? I better be OK, at least."" If anything, the physical burden is even harder on 71-year-old Charlie Watts, who has a masseuse on hand for his back after every rehearsal. ""It takes a heavy toll playing them drums,"" says Wood, ""to make it look like he's doing nothing, and to make it sound like those firecrackers going off. It all goes to his back, you know? He suffers terribly."" The Stones are bracing themselves to be asked yet again if this could be the last time. But even if it was, they'd never tell you. ""That's not a card, in my opinion, that should be played,"" says Jagger, who says he'd like to record another Stones album eventually. ""I know lots of people do play that card, but it nearly always backfires on them."" It's not lost on the Rolling Stones that they won't be alone on the road this winter, with so many of their peers -- Bob Dylan, the Who and Paul McCartney, to name a few -- also playing to huge audiences at this very late date. ""What can you say?"" Richards says. ""It's a hell of a generation."" Copyright © 2011 Rolling Stone.","For its upcoming fiftieth annivesary, the Rolling Stone have announced a not-quite-tour .

"(CNN) -- If you've been in the hospital or had a family member or friend there, you know how lonely and scary it can be. Once visiting hours are over, the levity and the hugs stop. But, if it were up to Taylor Crabtree, the hugs would last all night. Taylor Crabtree hopes to send 30,000 teddy bears to children in hospitals across the U.S. by September. When Taylor was 7 years old she started TayBear. Like many little girls, Taylor and her friends made hairclips to sell for extra money. But instead of spending it on herself, she used that extra money to buy teddy bears for kids hospitalized with cancer and chronic blood diseases. Taylor knew little about starting a business, but understood the heartbreak of cancer from her grandmother's battle with the disease. ""I thought, if it's that hard for my grandmother to go through, it must be so much harder for little kids,"" she said. Taylor's goal was to buy 50 bears for her local hospital. But, she couldn't resist the letters from kids (and kids at heart) asking her for more bears to hug at night. Now 17, Taylor has donated nearly 21,000 teddy bears to Hematology/Oncology departments across the country. Watch Taylor's CNN.com Live interview » . ""I've always loved teddy bears,"" Taylor said.

"(EW.com) -- Mindy Kaling vs. Ellen Barkin! Zooey Deschanel vs. Matthew Perry! Tuesday night unleashed a trio of new shows into competitive time slots: Fox's ""Ben & Kate,"" CBS' ""Vegas"" and — probably the most buzzed-about of the bunch — Fox's ""The Mindy Project."" Here's how they stacked up. First, Kaling's debut disappointed a bit. ""The Mindy Project"" (4.7 million viewers, 2.4) was down 23 percent from last year's ""Raising Hope"" premiere in this slot and dropped from its lead in. Still, ""Mindy Project"" fended off its 9:30 p.m. comedy rival, NBC's ""The New Normal"" (5.2 million, 2.0). ""Mindy"" also performed better than Fox's other new sitcom. At 8:30 p.m., ""Ben & Kate"" (4.2 million, 2.0) opened weak. Both ""Mindy Project"" and ""Ben & Kate"" had the benefit of the same lead-in (weirdly). Fox aired a special ""New Girl"" (5.3 million, 2.7) at 8 p.m., then aired ""New Girl's"" official regular time-period debut at 9 p.m. (5.2 million, 2.7). Both episodes delivered the same demo number, down a steep 44 percent from last fall's series premiere. The 9 p.m. ""New Girl"" tied NBC's ""Go On"" (7.3 million, 2.7). The Matthew Perry comedy was down a bit this week, but NBC will gladly accept this outcome against the return of a tough rival. Oh, why can't all these sitcoms just be friends? (Friends?). 'HIMYM': Hints about the 'finish line' At 10 p.m., CBS rolled out ""Vegas."" I gotta confess: Thought I didn't publicly bet on ""Vegas,"" I was starting to think this show could be a ratings surprise. So I was expecting a bigger number here. Vegas (14.7 million, 2.5) delivered a rather huge total audience for this slot, yet a weak adult demo rating (translation: a lot of older folks watched). Shows like ""NCIS,"" which we'll get to in a minute, manage to have the best of both worlds — delivering a ton of older viewers, but also a big enough younger viewers to still kick butt where it counts (from an advertising perspective, at least). The premiere of ""Vegas"" is ... fascinatingly schizophrenic. Based on total viewers, ""Vegas"" drew the biggest CBS fall drama premiere audience this time period since ""Judging Amy"" in 2002. Vegas is also, based on the 18-49 demo, the lowest-rated CBS Tuesday drama premiere since something called ""Century City"" back in 2004 ... I'm not even convinced that's a real show. So ""Vegas"" breaks records in two different directions. Expect to see a lot of conflicting headlines around the Web about this one. 'New Girl': Wild Schmidt pics! So let's take a step back now: CBS won the night; ABC came in fourth. The return of ""NCIS"" (20.2 million viewers, 4.1) was the night's top-rated show and only down a smidgeon from last year, followed by a similar story for NCIS: LA (16.7 million, 3.4). In addition to its comedies, NBC had ""The Voice"" (11.3 million, 4.0), down 15 percent, and Parenthood (4.8 million, 1.8), steady. ABC had ""Dancing With the Stars"" (11.6 million, 2.0), which continued the all-star edition's bummer ratings story this fall, down 31 percent. The return of ""Private Practice"" (6.6 million, 1.9) was down 32 percent from last fall's Thursday premiere and down somewhat from Body of Proof in this slot last year — taking ""Private Practice"" off its ""Grey's Anatomy"" life support on Thursdays firmly hurt it. Now let's taken an even bigger step back: All three of the newbies — ""Mindy,"" ""Vegas"" and even ""Ben & Kate"" — launched to a workable number ... ""Ben & Kate"" just barely so. Comedies sometimes grow from their premieres, while CBS' drama audience is like giant migrating herd that gradually shifts around the schedule as the viewers develop new habits.

"London (CNN) -- There was a time in the 1960s and 70s when Jimmy Savile seemed to be everywhere in Britain. The BBC television personality with his trademark white-blonde hair was the face of ""Top of the Pops"" and ""Jim'll Fix It."" Families would sit down with their children to watch Jimmy Savile in their homes. So when nine-year-old Kevin Cook learned his scout troop would be featured on Savile's show in 1974, he was absolutely thrilled. Cook told CNN: ""He was almost God-like. He was so famous. Everyone was writing to 'Jim'll Fix It.' When I told people at school, they just didn't believe it. When they knew we was going on, he was just fantastic. He was the person every child, certainly, wanted to know."" After the show, Cook presented a tie to Savile as a present. That's when he says Savile asked him if he would like his own ""Jim'll Fix it"" badge. According to Cook, Savile lead him backstage at BBC studios into a small, cluttered dressing room and sat him down in a chair. Profile: From national treasure to reviled 'abuser' ""He said to me: 'You want your own badge?' I said: 'Yeah.' He said: 'You want to earn your badge?'"" Savile proceeded to molest him, he says, undoing his boy scout uniform and fondling him. It was only interrupted when someone opened the door and peeked in, apologized and immediately walked out. That, he says, is when Savile issued this threat: . ""He said, 'Don't you dare tell anyone about this. No one will believe you because I'm King Jimmy. Don't tell your mates. We know where you live.' And that's it. That's the last I ever spoke to him,"" Cook told CNN. Cook kept the incident a secret for 37 years. When a number of women came forward several weeks ago with claims that Savile abused them as children, he decided to tell his wife. ""When I first heard, I thought, 'Oh my God.' I blamed myself for 37 years. That's the first thing you do. Blame yourself. But I was realizing it's not my fault. That's a relief. Do you tell anyone? I don't want to tell anyone else but my wife, I thought."" Immediately after he told his wife, Cook says, they called the police. TV icon sex abuse scandal rocks the BBC . Cook's case is now one of more than 200 allegations of abuse by Savile that UK police are investigating, stretching back as far as 1958 and as recently as 2006 - some of the incidents are alleged to have happened on BBC property. Jimmy Savile died in 2011, and Cook has no hope of bringing him to justice. But he does want an investigation into what BBC executives knew - and when -- about Savile's alleged predatory behavior, and whether they could have stopped it. ""I feel hatred towards them,"" he says of the BBC. ""Somebody must have known something. Obviously it was just covered up. That's disgraceful because, I don't know when it was known, but if it was [before] my incident, this might not have happened to me."" The BBC says it is launching an investigation into whether the culture and practices there at the time allowed Savile to carry out the sexual abuse of children. The broadcaster says that investigation will begin once it gets the go-ahead from authorities. In testimony before British lawmakers Tuesday, BBC Director General George Entwistle said, right now, the broadcaster is working with police and has sought to ensure nothing it does would compromise their investigation. Kevin says he feels guilty for not reporting the alleged incident sooner, and is now urging others to come forward. ""I've come forward now. If anyone ever suffered any abuse, you will be believed. It's the hardest thing I could have ever imagined to do,"" Cook said. ""Even after all these years, I still can't watch the man.""","Jimmy Savile was a hugely popular television and radio host in the UK .

Tara Suri's organization helps orphans in Sudan and India attend school. When Tara was 13, she was more than saddened by a trip to India with her family. From her sadness sprung the idea of trying to help the orphans in India and Sudan whom she saw abandoned by their parents, sometimes found in garbage dumps. ""It was somewhat of a revelation for me,"" said Tara. ""It was the first time I recognized the economic disparities and the gender inequalities that were there. And that really touched me and I knew I had to do something about it."" So she started H.O.P.E., or Helping Orphans Pursue Education. The organization aims to give kids the opportunity to achieve their full potential with the basics, like a sturdy roof over their heads, that Tara and her friends sometimes took for granted back in Scarsdale, New York. The organization ""sees education as a fundamental building block towards eradicating poverty and as a global solution to all the problems we currently face in the world,"" said Tara.

"Dumfries, Virginia (CNN) -- Retiree Robert Stevens says he often turns off the television when the attack ads appear, and he hangs up the phone when it's a presidential campaign calling. ""I want to make my own independent decision,"" Stevens said in a lunchtime conversation this week at Harold and Cathy's Dumfries Cafe. ""I don't want anybody shoving stuff down my throat."" Four years ago, Stevens recalls being ""fed up with Bush"" and intrigued by the idea of being part of history. ""I voted for Mr. Obama,"" he said. ""It was something different for the country. Something that hadn't happened before -- a black president. I got caught up in that a little bit. But I think he is a disappointment. I don't see jobs coming back. The housing market is coming back a little bit. But unemployment is still way above where it should -- where he predicted it would be."" Yet this self-described independent isn't sold on Mitt Romney, either. ""Absolutely not. At this point I don't know who I am going to vote for."" Why do you identify as an independent? His choice could go a long way in deciding who wins Virginia and the White House. Do the math: CNN's Electoral College calculator . Then-Sen. Obama in 2008 ended a streak of 10 consecutive Republican presidential wins in Virginia, and he did it by winning big in the northern Virginia suburbs within an hour or so drive from the nation's capital. In NOVA -- the local shorthand for northern Virginia -- the president had a 234,000-vote margin over GOP nominee John McCain. In the rest of the state, the two split the vote evenly. ""It's all about Northern Virginia,"" said Virginia-based GOP pollster Whit Ayres. ""So many people have moved into Northern Virginia, particularly from the Northeast -- Democratic areas -- that they've turned a solid red state into a purple state."" Romney campaign reports massive fund-raising haul . Democratic Rep. Gerry Connolly is one of those transplants; he moved to the area from Boston years ago while working as a staffer on Capitol Hill. Now, his district sits in the suburbs that have the potential to ruin Mitt Romney's night even before the polls close in the Midwest and West. ""A lot of people are focused on Ohio, but I really think it is just as conceivable that, frankly, the epicenter of this outcome is going to be right here in Virginia,"" Connolly said in an interview at an Obama campaign office in the heart of Prince William County. ""These 13 electoral votes are pretty critical."" By the numbers: Swing states . It's a tossup heading into the final days. Ayres likes the trend line. ""If you look at the dozen polls in Virginia taken before the first presidential debate on October 3, Obama was ahead in all 12,"" Ayres said in an interview at his office in Alexandria. ""If you look at the eight polls taken after the first presidential debate, Romney was ahead in six of the eight. ""Clearly the momentum is going in Romney's direction. Is it enough to win? We'll find out."" Polls: Dead heat in Colorado; Obama with slight advantage in Nevada . Top Obama advisers are more worried than they were just weeks ago, and some privately say it does look more likely that Romney will eke out a Virginia win. But Connolly is betting against it. He said the Republicans' effort to sound a more moderate tone of late is smart strategy, but he predicts it won't work. ""I think there is a trust factor with that,"" Connolly said. ""My constituents remember the Republican primaries. They don't suffer from amnesia. I think that's a tough sell for Mitt Romney."" Spend an hour at Harold and Cathy's and it's obvious the president retains deep suburban support. But there also is evidence of doubts that give Romney the opening to at least cut into the president's margins here, something he must do to have any chance of winning statewide. Mona Phillips is a registered Democrat. But she is voting Republican for president. Now that's not a lost vote for Obama -- she voted GOP in 2008, too. Obama campaign reports $90.5 million haul in start of October . Still, not bringing her back into the Democratic fold could ultimately hurt. ""Mr. Obama promised so many things that I didn't believe he could do it, and he has proven he couldn't do it,"" Phillips said. ""I'm going to vote for Romney. I have confidence in him. He has proven that he knows business and he makes it work."" Like Stevens, Phillips is no fan of the attack ads. But she said living in the pivotal area of a swing state makes it impossible to escape the campaign. ""Two or three times a week we will get a phone call,"" she said with a roll of the eyes. ""I also got two ads yesterday out of the mailbox."" Stevens said you can escape it ""if you turn off the TV. I see enough of it on the news every night. I just want to be able to sit back and clear my head and read."" By reading, he means news articles and other research he gathers on the candidates. Little-known candidates could harm Romney, Obama bids . He may be doing his best to ignore it, but both campaigns are working the state feverishly in the final days -- knowing their get-out-the-vote effort is likely to determine who wins this hotly contested battleground. Both claim the ground war edge. The Obama campaign's case: . • More than 60 field offices across Virginia. • Grass-roots organizing dating back to early 2009. • A 19% increase in the number of Latinos registered to vote since 2008, and a 7% increase of African-American registration. • Just shy of 60% of those registering to vote in the last two months are younger than 30. The GOP's counterargument: . • More than 1 million door knocks. • 5 million voter contacts. • Improved absentee and early voting numbers from 2008. Stevens will cast his ballot the old fashioned way: in person on Election Day. ""It's the economy -- jobs,"" he said of the overriding issue. ""I think the upper-income people should pay a little more. That's where I flip on the Obama side on this thing. By the same token, I see the big picture. I just think we need a change."" If he had to vote today? ""I'm pretty much undecided. It's kind of scary. I thought I would have been there by now. But I will be by Election Day."" Could Obama's struggles with white voters cost him the election?","Self-described independent disappointed with Obama but not sold on Romney .

"(Lonely Planet) -- The youngest of Hawaii's main islands -- and it's still growing, with over 500 acres of new land added over the last 30 years -- the Big Island of Hawai'i overflows with outdoor adventures. Here you can hike to the edge of the world's longest-running volcanic eruption, then climb Hawaii's two tallest peaks. Dropping back down to earth, trek into forested valleys harboring ancient heiau (Hawaiian temples) and wild beaches where you can camp by the surf in the silvery moonlight. Hawaii: The state that doesn't vote . Hawaii Volcanoes National Park . Start by going straight to the heart of the Big Island's live lava action: Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park. Here Kilauea Caldera has been spewing lava since 1983. During just the last few years, Halemau'mau Crater has once again become a roiling lake of fire. Traditionally believed to be the home of Pele, the Hawaiian goddess of fire and volcanoes, Halemau'mau Crater looks especially hellish after dark. Heavenly Hawaii: Dos and don'ts . Wait, isn't all this volcanic activity dangerous? Not exactly. Hawaiian shield volcanoes rarely erupt with fountains of fire, but instead send out lava flows that ooze above ground or in underground tubes with glowing skylights. When those flows reach the ocean, they send up huge plumes of steam that billow like clouds during the day and glow ghoulishly at night. Lonely Planet: Hiking O'ahu: a walk through Hawaii's history and culture . Depending on current volcanic activity, you may be able to hike to within view of the lava flow, either inside the park or at county-run Kalapana viewing area; call +1 (808) 961-8093 for up-to-date information. To luau or not to luau? Your Hawaii tips . If you want to set foot on older, more stable but still steaming lava flows, as seen in the alien landscapes of the 2001 Hollywood remake of ""Planet of the Apes,"" follow the park's 4-mile Kilauea Iki Trail, which descends from the volcanic crater rim and traipses over jet-back lava flows, which are slowly being recolonized by native plants, and through birdsong-filled rain forest kipuka (oases) spared Pele's wrath. Mauna Loa . In a far-flung corner of Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park, Mauna Loa (""Long Mountain"" in Hawaiian), the most massive volcano in Hawaii, stands watch. If you're a peak-bagger, the 19-mile trek to its summit is a worthy challenge. Intense sun exposure, white-out fog and the risks of hypothermia and altitude sickness don't deter ambitious, physically fit climbers from this multi-day ascent over a moonscape of volcanic lava flows to Manua Loa's otherworldly summit caldera. Travel Snapshots: Natural beauty shines in Aloha State . Day hikers who want to take the shortcut use the Mauna Loa Observatory Trail, another strenuous and breathtakingly high trail (13 miles round-trip) that starts off Saddle Rd outside the park. It's a steep, unearthly beautiful climb through rainbow-colored volcanic cinders to Mauna Loa's windy, exposed summit. Get an early start (before 8 a.m.) and check the weather forecast before setting out. The observatory access road is rough and mostly unpaved; a 4WD vehicle is helpful. Note most rental-car companies prohibit driving on unpaved roads, even in Jeeps. Lonely Planet: Kaua'i's coast and mountains: a hiker's dream . Mauna Kea . Mauna Kea is the world's tallest mountain -- taller even than Mt. Everest -- when measured from its base deep on the ocean floor all the way to its summit at 13,796 feet above sea level. Startlingly clear skies have made the summit an ideal place for building high-tech astronomical observatories; some are open to the public for visits and tours. For ancient Hawaiians, Mauna Kea was a pilgrimage spot for sacred ceremonies including burials, as well as collecting materials to make tools. The snow goddess Poli'ahu lives here, among the prehistoric lava flows and tiny Lake Waiau. Start partway up the mountain at the Mauna Kea Visitor Information Station, which offers free star-gazing programs nightly. Acclimatize to the heady 9000-foot elevation while you sip hot chocolate indoors. Most rental cars are not allowed to drive up to the summit, but you can still get there the hard way -- on foot. It's an eerie 6-mile climb each way, snaking around cinder cones at eye-level with the clouds and within distant view of the ocean, over two dizzying miles down below. Not up for such a workout? Catch sunset at the summit on a guided 4WD tour instead. Waipi'o & Waimanu Valleys . As thrilling as the Big Island's volcanoes are, just as impressive are its emerald amphitheater valleys. Curving along the coast in the shadow of the Kohala Mountains, most of these enormous valleys are completely inaccessible. But you can still capture panoramas of wildly bucking surf, patchwork fields of green taro plants and lacy waterfalls dropping off the cliffsides from the Waipi'o Valley Lookout. It's at the end of a paved highway from Honoka'a on the northern Hamakua Coast. From the lookout, it's a knee-knockingly steep 1-mile walk down a 4WD road to black-sand Waipi'o Beach where spinner dolphins cavort offshore. Hire a guide if you want to venture further back into Waipi'o Valley, because locals are fiercely protective of private property and you'll need someone who knows the landscape. Alternatively, get a permit in advance for a DIY backpacking trip to utterly remote Waimanu Valley, abandoned after a tsunami wiped out its village in 1946. The 9-mile Muliwai Trail from Waipi'o Valley into Waimanu Valley is rough, hazardous and extremely steep in spots, so only experienced backcountry hikers should attempt it. Lonely Planet: Hawaii's Big Island: how to make the most of a short trip . Pololu Valley . A much easier day hike awaits in the North Kohala district, at the end of a paved highway winding past Hawi. Sacred to ancient Hawaiians, the fertile Pololu Valley thrived with taro fields into the 20th century until the Kohala Ditch diverted water. Today you can hike down into this amphitheatre valley on a rocky hiking trail that's less than a mile long. Finish at a black-sand beach where you can sit, contemplate the breaking waves and feel the mana (spiritual power) of the Big Island's valleys and volcanoes.

"New York (CNN) -- They called them the ""human bucket brigade."" National Guard troops lined up in stairwells at Bellevue Hospital, carrying oil for generators up 13 flights of stairs. Superstorm Sandy had knocked out the hospital's power, and flooding had wiped out basement fuel pumps designed to power its generators. On Wednesday, when officials at one of the country's largest hospitals decided the storm damage was too extensive to keep the facility running, those same troops helped carry patients down flights of stairs to waiting ambulances, said Alan Aviles, president of New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation. The troops were ""tireless,"" he said, thanking them for their efforts. Dr. Gupta: Saving Baby Emma in the storm . More than half of the 725 patients who were inside Bellevue when the storm hit have been transferred, Aviles told CNN on Wednesday evening. The remaining 260 patients will be evacuated by Thursday, he said. Dozens of ambulances lined up outside the hospital to carry patients to other facilities. Officials had hoped to keep the hospital running, Aviles said, but an investigation Wednesday revealed that the damage had been too extensive. ""The emergency generators were just not enough to keep this hospital operating for the long term,"" he said. Bellevue is along the East River, just north of Manhattan's 26th Street. Floodwaters poured into the massive hospital's 1-million-square-foot basement, Aviles said, damaging fuel pumps and water pumps that supply the complex. None of the hospital's 32 elevators is working, he said. ""It was obviously not anticipated that we would get a storm surge of this magnitude. ... We've never seen anything like this at Bellevue Hospital,"" Aviles said. Officials estimate that 17 million gallons of water rushed into the hospital's basement, he said. 7 ways to manage stress in a disaster . Most of the critically ill patients have already been evacuated, said Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, who was reporting from outside the hospital Wednesday. Gupta said moving such patients is a particularly difficult process. ""It can be very challenging ... even to transfer them within the hospital from one floor to the next. That can be a real challenge,"" Gupta said. ""It's a very coordinated process. You always plan for the worst-case scenario. Everything from a patient's heart rate to their body temperature can change."" Gupta said evacuating the remaining patients is ""likely to be more methodical, a little bit slower, perhaps even look a little more organized than over the last 24 hours."" Aviles told reporters that it was too soon to tell when the hospital would be up and running again. ""If we can get this hospital back and operating in two or three weeks, we will be doing very well,"" he said. Hurricane safety: When the lights go out . Bellevue is just a few blocks away from NYU's Langone Medical Center, where staff evacuated about 260 patients -- including newborn babies that had been in intensive care -- after the storm hit. At times with only flashlights to illuminate the way, hospital employees carried some patients down 15 flights of stairs to ambulances ready to take them to the safety of other hospitals. Langone didn't anticipate such heavy flooding from Sandy and chose not to evacuate all its patients before the storm. But as the storm hit Monday night, the hospital's basement, lower floors and elevator shafts filled with 10 to 12 feet of water, and the hospital lost its power, according to Dr. Andrew Brotman, senior vice president and vice dean for clinical affairs and strategy. ""Things went downhill very, very rapidly and very unexpectedly,"" Brotman said. ""The flooding was just unprecedented."" NYU doctor to CNN's Piers Morgan: ""We are always prepared"" CNN's Elizabeth Cohen and Matt Sloane contributed to this report.","NEW: ""We've never seen anything like this,"" a hospital official says .

"London (CNN) -- The BBC has apologized to Britain's Queen Elizabeth II after a reporter revealed the monarch was ""pretty upset"" that British officials had failed to arrest radical Muslim cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri. Usually private conversations with members of Britain's royal family remain private. But in an extraordinary breach of this convention on BBC Radio 4, security correspondent Frank Gardner said the queen told him she had asked a government official why Hamza remained at large during his days as the imam of a mosque in London. Who is Abu Hamza? The revelation that the queen had personally lobbied a government official over Hamza, convicted in Britain for soliciting murder and inciting hatred in 2006, came as Gardner was discussing Hamza's probable extradition to the U.S. on terror charges. Speaking to Today program host James Naughtie, Gardner said: ""Actually, I can tell you that the queen was pretty upset that he was, this man was, there was no way to arrest him. She couldn't understand why -- surely there must have been some law he must have broken. Well in the end, sure enough there was. He was eventually convicted and sentenced for 7 years for soliciting murder and inciting racial hatred."" Naughtie, clearly taken aback by Gardner's revelation of a private conversation he'd had with the queen, called the disclosure a ""corker"" and said, ""That's a fascinating piece of information, Frank."" Gardner replied: ""Yes, I thought I'd drop that in -- she told me."" Gardner said: ""She spoke to the home secretary at the time and said, 'surely this man must have broken some laws, why is he still at large?'"" The queen rarely expresses her opinions -- let alone political views -- in public. Her role is to stay above politics, so Gardner's disclosure is a rare insight into how she privately engaged with Britain's government on a specific subject. CNN's Royal Correspondent Max Foster says the convention for anyone meeting the queen at a palace event is that the conversation is private. He said: ""If you accept the invitation, you accept that anything said is off the record."" In a statement on its website, the BBC wrote: ""This morning on the Today programme our correspondent Frank Gardner revealed details of a private conversation which took place some years ago with the Queen."" ""The conversation should have remained private and the BBC and Frank deeply regret this breach of confidence. It was wholly inappropriate. Frank is extremely sorry for the embarrassment caused and has apologised to the Palace."" When reached for a comment, a Buckingham Palace spokesman told CNN: ""We never comment on private conversations.""

"(CNN) -- Famed tenor Luciano Pavarotti, who died on Thursday at the age of 71, was one of opera's most adaptable and ebullient performers, appearing on stage with singers as varied as Dame Joan Sutherland, U2's Bono and Liza Minnelli. Much as the star power of Rudolf Nureyev and Mikhail Baryshnikov revived widespread interest in classical ballet in the 1970s and 1980s, Pavarotti's beaming charisma and bravura style captured the attention of the late-20th-century audience for opera. Widely considered the greatest tenor of his time, Pavarotti began his life modestly in Modena, the son of Fernando, a baker and amateur singer, and Adele, who worked at the local tobacco factory. ""I dreamed to become a singer when I was four and I hear my father singing in the church with a beautiful tenor voice,"" he told CNN in a 1991 interview. ""And I say to myself, well, let's try to do something."" The young Pavarotti -- who played soccer with his town's junior team -- joined the church choir with his father and traveled with him to Wales, where the singing group won first prize at the Llangollen International singing competition. Although the experience left Pavarotti enthralled with singing, he graduated from the local teaching institute in 1955 and taught elementary school for two years, then worked as an insurance salesman. He continued his vocal studies, however, working first with with Arrigo Pola and then with Ettore Campogalliani. Then, in 1961, Pavarotti won the prestigious Concorso Internazionale and made his operatic debut at the Reggio Emilia Theater as Rodolfo in Giacomo Puccini's ""La Boheme."" His fame spread throughout Italy and then throughout the European continent as he made his international debut in Giuseppe Verdi's ""La Traviata"" in Belgrade. When Dame Joan Sutherland brought him on-stage with her during a performance of Gaetano Donizetti's ""Lucia di Lammermoor"" with the Greater Miami Opera in 1965, Pavarotti began his American career. He debuted at New York's Metropolitan Opera House three years later, and eventually marked 379 performances there, including his final opera, Puccini's ""Tosca"" in 2004, in which he performed as the painter Mario Cavaradossi. In between Pavarotti sold millions of records and raised millions of dollars for charity through benefit concerts, often sharing the stage with pop stars as well as other opera singers. Of his recordings, 1990's ""The Essential Pavarotti"" was the first classical album to reach No. 1 on Britain's pop charts, where it remained for five weeks. 1994's ""The Three Tenors in Concert,"" with Placido Domingo and Jose Carreras, remains the best selling classical album of all time. Pavarotti joined with Domingo and Carreras in 1990, and although critics complained that Pavarotti's vocal skills were waning, the trio performed together for 14 years. Among his charities were a 1995 ""Concert for Bosnia"" that raised $8.5 million and other concerts that raised $3.3 million for refugees from Afghanistan and $1 million for refugees from Kosovo. In artistic terms, Pavarotti brought to the stage a voice neatly suited to the traditional bel canto, or ""beautiful singing"" style, essential to 17th-century Italian opera. As much about intensity as pitch, bel canto focuses the voice, concentrating the sound with both outstanding warmth and agility. So demanding is this work even of the best singers that Pavarotti in concert recital could be seen rising to the balls of his feet during the most challenging passages. A long, white handkerchief always hung from one hand as he sang, his eyebrows arched high in the effort, forming an expression seemingly of surprise at his own success. From his small beginnings, Pavarotti rose to great heights, performing in front of 500,000 people in New York's Central Park -- a concert seen by millions on television -- and before another 300,000 at Paris' Eiffel Tower. He won countless awards and honors -- including five Grammies -- and was named United Nations Messenger for Peace by then-Secretary-General Kofi Annan. He launched an international competition, The Pavarotti International Voice Competition, in 1982. He even founded a teaching facility for young singers in his home town. His signature aria, Puccini's ""Nessun Dorma"" from ""Turandot,"" was chosen as the theme music for the 1990 soccer World Cup, hosted by Italy. He also performed the aria at the opening ceremony of the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin. The great singer was also known as an equestrian expert, organizing one of the international show jumping circuit's most important competitions, the Pavarotti International, in Modena. Coinciding with that event, Pavarotti also staged an annual charity concert, Pavarotti and Friends. The portly singer retired from staged opera in 2004, but was on a ""farewell tour"" of concerts when he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2006 and underwent emergency surgery to remove the tumor. Although the remaining concerts of his tour were canceled, his management said that he hoped to resume the tour in 2007. When cancer finally stopped Pavarotti from singing, it was only the second interruption of his career. ""I think I just stopped for one year when from a kid I become a man and the voice is changing,"" he said in 1991. ""I was an alto and became a tenor and that is the only time I think I remember to have stopped singing. Otherwise I have sung all my life."" E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- How do living organisms become conscious of what is happening to them and around them? How is it that I as well as you, reader of these words, can be conscious of our respective existences and of what is going on in our minds — in my case, ideas about how the brain generates consciousness, about the fact that I was asked to prepare this particular text for a specific deadline, along with the fact that I happen to be in Paris, at the moment, not Los Angeles, and that I am writing this on a cold January day. The biological mechanisms behind the phenomena of consciousness remain unclear although it is fair to say that recently our understanding has made remarkable progress. What are we are certain of understanding and where is it that our understanding fails? On the side of understanding, we can point to the process of sensory representation as an important part of consciousness. Most of what we are conscious of (conceivably all that we are conscious of) consists of representations of objects and events in the sensory modalities in which our brains trade, for example, vision, hearing, touching, smelling, taste, sensing the state of our body's interior. Mapping, in other words. Our brains, at all the levels of their organization, are inveterate makers of maps, simple and not so simple, and as far as I can gather, we only become conscious of the things and actions that the sensory systems help us map. We depend, for the business of consciousness, on constructing maps of the most varied features and events. We construct those maps in brain regions that serve as platforms for this natural process of cartography. These are regions where signals about topographic and topological relationships among components of objects and actions can be broken down and assembled in a manner that corresponds to the way in which they happen in the objects and actions themselves. But while mapped representations are a necessity for consciousness, as far as I can imagine, they are not sufficient for consciousness to occur. For example, several orders of computers aboard a Boeing 747 represent with great fidelity many parts of the airplane body — moving parts of the wings, undercarriage, rudder — not to mention outside temperature, wind speeds, levels of fuel, and so forth. And yet we do not expect even the most integrated computer among the 747's computer family to be ""conscious"" of what goes on in the plane, except in a metaphorical sense. That top computer knows a lot about the plane's behavior but it does not ""know,"" in the sense that the reader and I know, at this very moment, that we are alive and puzzling over the mysteries of consciousness. What is different about us? Plenty, I would say. Beginning at the top of the scale of differences, the 747 lacks a self in the sense that you and I have one. I have proposed that selves are built from, but not limited to, myriad, integrated representations of the structure and operations of our bodies, and of the sum total of memories of what has happened to our own body in its history. The 747 does not have the equivalent of that part of a self for the very good reason that it does not need one to comply with the demands of its captain. But we do. There is an even deeper difference, however, that has to do with the issue of feeling. An integral part of the notion of self, beginning at the lowest level of self — the primordial self and present all the way up to the autobiographical self — is the fact that we feel the living body to which experiences are happening. We feel our body as it lives in the world and wanders in it. We experience everything we map through our senses because we feel the body that is the site of all the mappings. Or to put it more clearly, when we move about or see an object, or hear a voice, we feel the changes that such actions and perceptions caused in our organism. I believe to be conscious of our perceptions is to have ongoing representations of streams of events that affect our bodies, cause feelings, and become felt representations. Representing and feeling are dovetailed phenomena that sit at the rock bottom of experience. As we unravel the biological mechanisms behind feeling I suspect we will come to uncover their origins at the level of single neurons. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- ""A swarm"" of several hundred earthquakes, the strongest measuring a 5.5 magnitude, were centered east of San Diego near California's border with Mexico on Sunday afternoon but caused little damage, seismologists said. Sunday's shaking in Southern California's Imperial Valley was the most activity recorded there since the 1970s, according to U.S. Geological Survey seismologist Lucy Jones. ""We are having a swarm,"" Jones said. ""We expect thousands of events (like this) over several days."" In Brawley, the town closest to the center of the swarm, a Fire Department dispatcher said there were no reports of injuries so far. Brawley is about 100 miles east of San Diego and about 200 miles southeast of Los Angeles. Major earthquake hits off coast of El Salvador . Only minor damage had been reported, said Robert Graves, another USGS seismologist. Graves told reporters that about 300 quakes had been recorded by Sunday evening. More than 30 had a magnitude over 3.5, and the biggest ""are a little bit larger than what we have seen in these types of processes in the past."" Graves said the area is a ""zone of transition"" between the Imperial and San Andreas faults and tends to have more frequent earthquake activity than other parts of California. He said that previous swarms -- some of which were recorded as early as the 1930s -- weren't precursors to a bigger quake, but ""that's not to say it won't happen."" ""At the very least, use this is a reminder: We live in earthquake country,"" he said. ""If we're going to have an earthquake, it's as likely today as it is tomorrow or next week.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The nation's second largest city is preparing for potential traffic paralysis with the closure this weekend of a major highway that passes through the mountains of Los Angeles. Last year's closure of Interstate 405 -- described by local officials as ""the nation's busiest freeway"" -- was expected to be so apocalyptic that car-loving Los Angeles labeled the weekend shutdown ""Carmageddon."" In fact, traffic flowed rather smoothly because many motorists stayed home, and the freeway through the Sepulveda Pass reopened ahead of schedule on that July 2011 weekend. This year's construction effort is dubbed ""Carmageddon II,"" and officials are concerned again about ultra-gridlock out of a fear that motorists may take to the roads this weekend out of excessive confidence and complacency. Motorists should avoid driving this weekend in affected areas, local officials said. ""We don't want people to become complacent based on the success of last year's closure. Once again, it's vitally important that we all plan ahead, avoid the area, and eat, shop and play locally. Otherwise, there will be problems,"" said Michael Miles, the California Department of Transportation's director for Los Angeles and Ventura counties. K.N. Murthy, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority's executive director of transit project delivery, said: ""The risk factors that caused transportation, law enforcement and emergency response agencies heartburn during last year's I-405 freeway closure have not changed. ""I-405 is still the nation's busiest freeway,"" he said. ""The closure is still in the geographically constrained Sepulveda Pass, where there are no immediate or effective alternate routes. That's why we still need the public's full and complete cooperation if this second closure operation is going to be as successful as the first."" A 10-mile section of Interstate 405 is scheduled to be closed from as early as 10 p.m. Friday (1 a.m. ET Saturday) until 5 a.m. (8 a.m. ET) Monday. The 405, as it's locally called, cuts through the Santa Monica Mountains and connects suburban San Fernando Valley with Los Angeles International Airport and the well-to-do neighborhoods of west Los Angeles, such as Bel Air and Brentwood. Specifically, the 405 will be closed between Interstate 10 and U.S. 101. The highway construction project this weekend will complete a carpool lane system over the mountain pass to create a continuous carpool lane of almost 73 miles in each direction between Orange County and Los Angeles County's San Fernando Valley -- the longest in the world, officials said. Highway reconstruction will continue until 2013, when the overall $1.34 billion project is scheduled for completion, officials said. Improvements include new bridges and ramps and building 18 miles of retaining and sound walls, officials said.","This weekend's closure of Interstate 405 is dubbed ""Carmageddon II'

"(Health.com) -- Infants who undergo surgical procedures requiring general anesthesia in their first two years of life may be at increased risk of developing attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as they grow older. A new study of 5,357 children born in Rochester, Minnesota, between 1976 and 1982 found that kids who underwent at least two such surgeries before their second birthday were roughly twice as likely as their peers to develop ADHD by the time they were 19. Having a single surgical procedure did not appear to increase risk. In this group of infants, 7.3% of those with no exposure to anesthesia and 10.7% of those with just one exposure went on to develop ADHD -- a difference the researchers deemed to be negligible, statistically speaking. By contrast, infants who had two or more experiences with anesthesia had a dramatically higher 17.9% chance of developing ADHD, according to the study, which appears this week in the journal Mayo Clinic Proceedings. Health.com: What causes ADHD? 12 myths and facts . The longer a child was unconscious, the greater the ADHD risk, which suggests that even several short exposures to anesthesia could heighten risk, says senior study author David O. Warner, M.D., a pediatric anesthesiologist at the Mayo Clinic, in Rochester. Warner, however, stresses that parents should not be unduly alarmed if their child requires general anesthesia. ""All we can say is that we can't exclude that this could be a problem,"" he says, noting that the findings do not prove cause and effect. Very few young children undergo surgery requiring general anesthesia, and those who do typically have serious medical conditions that can't be ignored. Procedures might include hernia repair (to prevent a section of intestine from getting trapped and causing an obstruction), or surgeries to correct life-threatening abnormalities of the lungs or heart. Health.com: 9 food additives that may affect ADHD . The new findings should not dissuade parents or doctors from approving necessary surgery, says Peter J. Davis, M.D., anesthesiologist-in-chief at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. ""There is no data to suggest that kids who require surgery shouldn't have it,"" says Davis, who was not involved in the study. Concerns about the potential impact of general anesthesia on brain development first arose about 10 years ago, after studies showed that young animals exposed to anesthesia had brain changes that were associated with behavioral problems. At the time, investigators didn't think the results from animal studies would be borne out in humans. But a study published last year by Warner and his colleagues found that young children had double the risk of developing learning disabilities if they'd been exposed to multiple rounds of general anesthesia. Health.com: ADHD linked to pesticide exposure . The new study implies the same pattern might hold for ADHD, although a number of major caveats apply. Only 350 children -- less than 1% of the study participants -- were put under for a surgical procedure, which is a small sample from which to draw conclusions. And more than two-thirds of the children needing surgery were boys, who are already at triple the risk for ADHD than girls. In addition, most of the surgeries, which took place in the late 1970s and early 1980s, involved the anesthetic halothane, which is no longer used. Finally, not all of the children received an ADHD diagnosis from a doctor. The researchers identified most ADHD cases by piecing together detailed school and medical records, although they used a rigorous multistep process to do so. Health.com: What if my child begins to exhibit symptoms of ADHD? But perhaps the main reason for caution is that the authors can't rule out the possibility that the medical conditions that prompted the surgeries, rather than the anesthetic, are responsible for the increased ADHD risk. Similarly, they can't rule out the possibility that some other aspect of surgery or recovery, such as medications, may be to blame. ""The issues of surgery and anesthesia really can't be separated in all this,"" Davis says. Still, there is some evidence that suggests a link between general anesthesia and ADHD is plausible. In animals, anesthetics -- including newer-generation drugs -- seem to speed up the otherwise normal process of cell death, which may make the brain more vulnerable to ADHD, Warner says. The drugs may also directly damage neurons, he adds. The good news is that the window in which a child's brain is developing rapidly and is susceptible to this type of damage appears to be relatively brief. Researchers haven't pinned down the exact time frame, but animal studies suggest that the risk of damage decreases after about age three, Warner says.

"West Branch, Michigan (CNN) -- A Michigan teen is making the most of a homecoming prank that she says left her feeling suicidal. Whitney Kropp, a self-described outcast with just a handful of close friends at Ogemaw Heights High School, was picked to be the female representative of the sophomore class royalty. It certainly came as a shock. But hours later, the 16-year-old learned classmates voted for her as a joke. She spent the night in tears. ""I'm like, 'Wow, I feel like trash,'"" Kropp said. ""I feel like I'm a little thing that no one really cares about."" That night, she said, she contemplated ending her life ""right here, right now."" But thanks to a push from her family and friends, she decided to embrace what happened and turn the tables. ""I can just prove all these kids wrong ... I'm not the joke everyone thinks I am."" Worthy homecoming for bullied teen . The West Branch-Rose City Area Schools superintendent, Dan Cwayna, declined CNN's request for an interview. Opting to stay on the homecoming court was a tough decision, Kropp said. That bold move prompted local businesses to donate her homecoming gown and shoes, while a salon gave her hair a new 'do.' A Facebook support page created for her has more than 96,000 ""likes."" Sitting on her front porch in rural Michigan, Kropp held her head high with what her mom described as a new and overwhelming sense of confidence. ""It is absolutely awesome to see her stand up,"" a beaming Bernice Kropp said. ""And it's so cool to see e-mails ... we're getting from parents and other students from all over the place telling her stories and how it helped them and it touched them. My daughter is out there as an inspiration to a lot of people, and it's a really cool thing."" The teen says the outpouring of support caught her off guard. ""I thought before, 'Oh, no one cares about me,''' she said. ""I thought not even my own brother and sister care. But they're proving me they do care. The world is proving they do, well not really care about me, but they care about the situation. So I'm happy. I'm really honored."" WNEM: Community steps up for bullied teen . In fact, her sister, Alivia Kropp, was the first person to spread the word and encourage her to speak out. ""I told her ... you've got the courage, you've got the strength to go do it, so go do it and have fun,"" she said. She said the night her sister spent crying was horrible. ""It's very hard to see someone hurt and upset, and you want to do everything in your power to make sure they're not that way,"" Alivia Kropp said. Homecoming coronation will take place at halftime of the football game Friday night, where the teen's smile will be front and center as family, and an entire community, surround her with support. The dance, something she and her boyfriend have been looking forward to all year, is Saturday. When asked where she got the courage to stand up unashamed in front of the whole world, she pointed to her heart.

"BAGHDAD (CNN)  -- Three Iraq boys were killed in an airstrike in eastern Baghdad on Saturday as they were sifting through trash, looking for stuff to sell, said a 10-year-old boy wounded in the attack. Ambulances sit damaged after a U.S. attack Saturday near Baghdad's Al-Sadr Hospital. ""I was hit by an American helicopter,"" Ahmed Yahya said. ""I was with a group of about 10 children who were collecting empty soft drink cans in Jamila. We haven't done anything."" U.S. military officials confirmed firing two Hellfire missiles at a rooftop in the vicinity about the same time that the boy said the attack took place. However, they say the only damage U.S. forces saw was to the rooftop. Another boy said his brother died in the attack. Dr. Jawad al-Mousawi, chief doctor at Imam Ali hospital in Sadr City, said the hospital received the bodies of three boys and a wounded boy about 2 p.m. He said the hospital saw three other fatalities and treated 23 wounded people from airstrikes and fighting across the city. An ambulance driver at the hospital said it took three hours to transport the boys because of fighting in the area. Elsewhere in Baghdad, U.S. soldiers killed five suspected militants and detained 24 others in fighting Friday and Saturday in the city's southern Rashid district. Earlier Saturday at least 28 people were wounded in a U.S. attack on a building near a hospital in Baghdad's sprawling Sadr City area, an Iraqi Interior Ministry official said. Employees of al-Sadr Hospital were among the wounded, and the facility's property sustained damage, including to some ambulances, the official said. In a statement, the U.S. military said the strike targeted ""known criminal elements."" ""We did hit the target, which was a criminal command and control center, which was near a hospital,"" the military said, adding that it was assessing damages.  Watch scenes of damage near the hospital » . The Interior Ministry official called the attack an airstrike, but the U.S. military said it was a guided multiple-launch rocket system strike. These guided rockets are launched from armored vehicles. Al-Sadr Hospital is one of the two main medical facilities in the district, where Iraqi and U.S. troops have been battling Shiite militias loyal to radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr. The strike left a large hole in the ground near the hospital, video footage showed. Chunks of concrete and other rubble covered the ground, and car windows were shattered. The southern portion of Sadr City has been walled off so that U.S. military and Iraqi security forces can control movements there. Other developments . • Four U.S. Marines were killed Saturday when their vehicle struck a roadside bomb in Iraq's al Anbar Province, the military said. Their names were withheld pending notification of their families. • Turkey's military said Saturday that it had killed more than 150 Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq in an operation that ended early Friday, according to a statement on the military's Web site. Turkey has been staging attacks against rebels with the PKK, or Kurdistan Workers' Party, in the Qandil Mountain region in northern Iraq. A PKK official said Friday there were no party casualties. • A roadside bomb exploded Saturday at a traffic patrol in the western part of Baghdad, killing an Iraqi traffic police officer and wounding eight others, including six traffic police officers, a ministry official said. • Overnight, six people were killed and 25 were wounded in Sadr City, the Interior Ministry said. The U.S. military said it killed six ""criminals."" On Friday, U.S. forces killed eight suspected militants during 10 hours of fighting in the Shiite neighborhood, a military statement said. • A U.S. soldier on combat patrol in eastern Baghdad was killed Friday when a roadside bomb struck the soldier's vehicle, the military said.

"(CNN)  -- For one group of women in Chicago on Sunday, Mother's Day was marked not with flowers, but with a stark reminder of their loss. One by one, they filed toward a newly unveiled sculpture at the city's St. Sabina Church, placing small white cards emblazoned with names such as Blair Holt and Matthew Michael Rodriguez at the foot of the two figures in the sculpture. For some of the women, the realistic work of a faceless, gun-wielding assailant killing a young girl was too much to bear, CNN affiliate WGN reported. Instead of being celebrated by their children this holiday, these mothers were mourning the deaths of their children -- all victims of gun violence on Chicago's streets. ""Today, as I woke up, instead of what a lot of mothers get, which are flowers or Happy Mom's Day or a kiss, I didn't get any of that,"" said Maria Ramirez, whose son, Matthew, was killed at 16. ""I don't even get to hear anybody say 'Mama' anymore. I'll never hear that again."" The sculpture's artist, J.S. Kenar, said he was trying to ""show the pain, to show that something unhuman is going on here."" The city has been plagued by bloodshed on its streets this year, including a particularly deadly stretch last month in which seven people were killed and 18 wounded in a 12-hour period. Statistics released Sunday by Chicago police show that while the overall violent crime rate has decreased by 11 percent this year, the city's homicide rate has risen 8 percent. As of Saturday, 127 killings have been recorded this year -- three more homicides than the 2008 yearly total. ""We cannot ignore the destructive nature of guns, and how their presence can escalate a volatile situation into a tragic one,"" police Superintendent Jody Weis said in a statement announcing the statistics. Annette Holt knows firsthand how destructive gun violence can be to a family. Her son, Blair, an honor student at Chicago's Percy L. Julian high school, was shot on a city bus in 2007. He was killed in a hail of gang bullets when he jumped into the line of fire to save the life of a teenage girl. He was 16. At Sunday's unveiling, Holt implored other mothers to do all they can to stop the cycle of violence. ""Do something to make a difference now before you're like us (and) your child is either in the cemetery for Mother's Day or birthdays, or your child is in jail for 100 years,"" she said.","On Mother's Day, moms of children killed in gun violence go to St. Sabina Church .

"PALLAVAKAM, India (CNN) -- South India's sun beats down on a long line of trucks wending to the Bay of Bengal. In the back of these trucks, giant, brightly painted statues of the Hindu god Ganesha are waiting to be dropped in the nearby ocean. Ganesha worshippers transport their Idol for an immersion ritual. All over India, Hindus recently celebrated the birthday of the elephant god and now the idols made for this festivity are being taken to India's ocean, rivers and lakes and deposited. It's part of the Hindu religious cycle. But it's also a huge source of pollution. And in recent years, idol immersion has become a popular local event, with some statues so huge they must be lifted by cranes. The Ganeshas gleam with gold paint and glisten with reds, pinks and greens. But scientists who've studied the problem say these paints often contain toxic metals, such as lead and mercury. They contaminate plants, and poison fish and irrigation and drinking water. They end up in the human food chain. The problem is not just caused by idols of Ganesha, but by the many other Hindu god idols as well, such as Saraswati and Durga. Hundreds of thousands of god idols are immersed every year in festivals across India. A detailed study of the problem has been done by Shyam R. Asolekar of the Indian Institute of Technology in Bombay. He estimates that, in the city of Mumbai alone, several hundred thousand idols are made annually.  Watch a Hindu immersion ritual » . Decades ago, there were far fewer idols and idols were made of mud and biodegradable materials, Asolekar said. The effect also was ""minimal"" he said, because waterways weren't linked as they are now. As a result of water and irrigation projects, ""connected water systems and dams have reduced the flow of water"" and dramatically increased the effect of pollution. According to Asolekar's study, ""Forbidding the disposal of painted idols, ornaments and decoration is the only sure way of protecting our water bodies."" Various Indian states are testing out new approaches, such as mobile immersion tanks, and encouraging mud idols. Asolekar dismissed the idea of an eco-friendly idol, saying even large amounts of mud kill waterways. ""The number of idols is so high,"" he said, ""no matter what the material, there will always be an impact. Even organic substances in large quantities cause a problem."" He suggests a ""dry immersion,"" in which the idol is sprinkled symbolically with water and then later dried for reuse. This approach would face great hurdles in a country where religious rituals have deep social and cultural ties and change comes slowly. Another possible interim measure uses a polymer-lined tank for immersion. More than 100 such tanks have been installed in Mumbai. The linings can be rolled up after use and the materials separated into bio and nonbiodegradable materials for composting and landfill. The water is filtered. But this solution is far from ideal, Asolekar said, as tens of thousands of such tanks would be needed, and there is still plenty of contamination. ""It will take time to change people's attitudes,"" he said.","Hindu ritual of immersing idols in oceans, rivers and lakes is causing contamination .

"(CNN) -- As Syria's foreign minister blasted international calls for President Bashar al-Assad to step down, Syrian forces were shelling civilian neighborhoods and battling rebel forces, opposition leaders said. Foreign Minister Walid Moallem told the U.N. General Assembly that the rhetoric against al-Assad amounts to a ""blatant interference in the domestic affairs of Syria, and the unity of its people and its sovereignty."" Here are some of the latest events in the Syrian uprising: . Deadly violence . At least 183 people were killed Monday, including 12 children, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. The deaths included more than 30 due to aerial shelling, the group said. Forty-two people were killed in Idlib -- at least 30 of them ""in a massacre"" in the town of Seqlein, the LCC said. The group reported that 55 people were killed in and around Damascus. The Free Syrian Army launched an offensive to gain control of the Aleppo military airport on the outskirts of Syria's largest city, said Abdulla Yasin, spokesman for the rebel fighters. There were fierce clashes with al-Assad's troops for control of the vital base, he said, adding that FSA troops destroyed four fighter planes and a tank at the airport. Eleven civilians were killed when a regime shell struck a mosque in the Hnano neighborhood, Yasin said. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) said Monday its forces carried out operations against gatherings of ""terrorists"" in Aleppo and elsewhere, inflicting ""heavy losses."" Seventeen citizens were ""martyred in terrorists' shelling"" on a village in Homs Sunday, the government said. Hama Massacre recalled as troops move into city . Syrian security forces are uprooting thousands of people and demolishing their homes in the western flashpoint city of Hama, residents told CNN. As security forces surround the Mesha Alarbeen district and bulldozers tear down homes inside, the Hama Massacre is still fresh in the minds of many who live there. Between 3,000 and 40,000 people were believed to have died when the military acting under orders from Hafez al-Assad -- the father of the current Syrian president -- brutally cracked down on a revolt in 1982. A 1983 Amnesty International report put the toll on both sides between 10,000 and 25,000. Hama is once again an epicenter of the anti-government movement that has roiled the country. ""So far they have razed 120 buildings,"" Osamah, a Hama resident who visited the neighborhood on Sunday, told CNN. SANA reported a ""massive presence of terrorist armed gangs that threaten"" the people of Hama. Other SANA articles referenced how security forces had found large amounts of weapons in the area. The Syria toll, so far . Newly released casualty figures from the LCC put the number of civilians and opposition fighters killed in the conflict at around 28,000 . More than 24,000 of them were civilians, the LCC said. Thousands of Syrian troops have also reportedly been killed. The opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says more than 30,000 people have died in the unrest. CNN is unable to independently confirm casualty reports as the Syrian government has severely limited the access of international journalists. The new casualty figures show August was the deadliest month, with 5,091 killed. In September, 4,071 people were killed, according to the LCC. Report: Iraq to search Iranian planes bound for Syria . Iraq will conduct random searches of Iranian planes bound for Syria to check for arms shipments, Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshiyar Zebari said in an interview published Sunday in the al-Hayat newspaper. Zebari said Iraq will not act as a passageway or a channel for arms to make their way into Syria. ""We are not with the militarization of the conflict. We are against the arming the regime or the opposition,"" he said. The foreign minister told the newspaper that U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and others raised concerns about arms shipments. The United States believes Iran, one of al-Assad's strongest supporters, is arming government forces. Clinton has called on Syria's neighbors to take steps to prevent Iran from using its land and airspace to deliver shipments to Syria. Iraq faces a difficult task in enforcing the inspections, Zebari said. ""We explained to the U.S. side that Iraq's air defense capabilities are limited, and we are in the stage of building our air force,"" he said. More: Syrian rebels claim knowledge of chemical weapons site . Iranian flights over Iraq to Syria began in March but were stopped shortly after at the request of Iraq, Zebari said. The flights resumed in July. ""They said these flights contain no weapons or hardware, and that they transport pilgrims, visitors and so on. But to verify their shipments, we will ask these planes to land,"" Zebari said. Last week, Baghdad rejected a request from North Korea to fly through its airspace to Syria because of a suspicion the flight was carrying arms. Background . The Syrian conflict broke out in March 2011 after unarmed protesters, inspired by the success of popular uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia, took to the streets demanding political reform. The movement devolved into an armed conflict after a brutal and continuing crackdown by government forces. Foreign Minister Moallem spoke Monday to the U.N. General Assembly just days after world leaders painted a grim picture of the conflict. Syria has dominated much of the General Assembly discussion -- on stage and on the sidelines -- as world leaders struggle to find a way to resolve the war that has left the Security Council hopelessly deadlocked, with China and Russia opposing some of the toughest measures proposed. The Security Council has been paralyzed by a division over how to halt the killing in Syria. Russia and China have blocked resolutions calling for al-Assad to transfer power and step down, saying the issue should be settled by Syrians. Germany has slammed the U.N. Security Council for failure to act, and the United States, Britain and France announced they are backing increased support of non-lethal aid to the Syrian opposition.

"(CNN) -- The son of disgraced Chinese politician Bo Xilai says the laundry list of allegations leveled against his father contradicts ""everything I have come to know about him throughout my life."" Bo Xilai was once considered a top contender for the Politburo Standing Committee, the team of nine politicians who effectively rule China. But last week, the Communist Party relieved him of his duties and expelled him. He also faces possible criminal charges in connection with the murder of a British businessman, a crime for which is wife has been convicted. On Saturday, Bo's son, Guagua, posted a statement on Tumblr, a microblogging site, where he defended his ""upright"" father. The statement made no mention of his mother. ""Personally, it is hard for me to believe the allegations announced against my father, because they contradict everything I have come to know about him throughout my life,"" the younger Bo wrote. ""Although the policies my father enacted are open to debate, the father I know is upright in his beliefs and devoted to duty."" In an e-mail to CNN on Sunday, the son declined to comment further on the case. He said his statement posted to Tumblr was all he could say at the moment. The statement followed news Friday by the state-run Xinhua new agency that the elder Bo had been expelled from the Communist Party and faced prosecution on criminal charges. The Xinhua report on his expulsion painted a portrait of corruption, abuse of power and improper sexual relationships. The party said the politician made ""severe mistakes"" in the killing of the British businessman and a diplomatic incident involving a police official, Xinhua reported. Investigators cited influence peddling, bribery and womanizing, new details found in the course of the party's investigation. ""Bo had or maintained improper sexual relationships with a number of women,"" the state news agency said. He also took advantage of his power to seek profits and received bribes, and his family ""accepted a huge amount of money and property from others,"" Xinhua said. The son said he could not reconcile the man accused of such acts and the man he knows as his father. ""He has always taught me to be my own person and to have concern for causes greater than ourselves. I have tried to follow his advice,"" he said in the statement. ""At this point, I expect the legal process to follow its normal course, and I will await the result."" The elder Bo is a charismatic, albeit controversial, politician who launched a ""smashing black, singing red"" campaign in the southwestern city of Chongqing that promoted Communist ideology and zealously cracked down on organized crime. His economic programs, which included millions spent on social welfare, made him a popular leader in Chongqing. But analysts say his populist policies and high-profile personal style were seen as a challenge to the more economically liberal and reform-oriented faction that dominates the current party leadership. The politician's fortunes changed when news surfaced this year that his wife, Gu Kailai, was a suspected accomplice in the poisoning of businessman Neil Heywood. Heywood died in November in Chongqing, where the elder Bo was the Communist Party chief. His death was originally blamed on excessive alcohol consumption. The politician was soon stripped of his top posts for ""serious breach of discipline."" In August, his wife received a suspended death sentence after a seven-hour trial. The case also put the son under scrutiny as reports emerged over his lavish student lifestyle. Photographs of him bare-chested with his arms around women at a party at the University of Oxford were widely published and received badly in China. The father defended his son when the reports first came out, accusing people of trying to make the 24-year-old look bad. The younger Bo graduated from Harvard's Kennedy School of Government in May. He previously attended the University of Oxford, graduating in 2010. Wang Lijun, the former police chief of Chongqing, set off the controversial story on February 6, when he fled to the U.S. Consulate in Chengdu and told American diplomats that Gu was a suspected accomplice in a murder case. After his request for asylum was turned down, Wang left the consulate and was taken away by Chinese officials. But his accusations rocked the world's most populous nation. Wang last week was sentenced to 15 years for defection, cover-up, bribe taking and abuse of power. CNN's Jason Kessler and Paul Armstrong contributed to this report.","NEW: Bo Guagua said ""it is hard for me to believe the allegations""

"(CNN) -- African-Americans are faring slightly worse relative to their white counterparts than they did last year, according to an index released Thursday by the National Urban League. The group's 2011 Equality Index stands at 71.5%, compared to a revised index last year of 72.1%, the league said as it released its annual report, called The State of Black America. An equality index of less than 100% suggests blacks are doing worse relative to whites, while an index greater than 100% suggests blacks are doing better. The league attributed the 2011 drop to a decline in the economics index, driven by housing and wealth factors, and to a decline in the health index, driven by children's health. Economics and social justice continue to be the areas in which blacks trail whites the most, with ratings of 56.9% and 58% respectively. Those are followed by health at 75% and education at 78.9%. Since the Equality Index was introduced in 2005, researchers have found growing equality between blacks and whites in the unemployment rate, the percentage of uninsured, the incarceration rate, and prisoners as a percentage of arrests, the league said. The index has also charted growing inequality over that period in rates of poverty, home ownership, school enrollment (both ""preprimary"" and college), and the level of educational attainment (both high school diplomas and bachelor's degrees). The index of median household income has remained unchanged, the league said. In 2010, the index measured Hispanics in America for the first time. This year's index finds them faring slightly better than last year compared to their white counterparts, at 76.8% compared to a revised 2010 index of 76.6%, the league said. It attributed the rise to improvements in health and social justice indices, but said those were offset by declines in economics and education. In the past year, the league said it has observed growing gaps in the relative status of blacks and whites in the areas of loan access, wealth and children's health. For Hispanics, there have been growing gaps in the areas of loan access and college enrollment, it said. The 2011 State of Black America report includes essays from a variety of authors including League President Marc Morial and Democratic strategist Donna Brazile.","The index measures how African-Americans fare relative to whites .

"(Financial Times) -- Until very recently, nouveau riche Chinese would not have been caught dead buying someone else's cast-offs -- even if they were Hermès. But as the Chinese market, which many luxury goods companies have come to rely on for growth in recent years, matures, a new brand of luxury shopper is emerging in China: the kind that loves a bargain more than a logo. Shops selling, renting and repairing second-hand luxury goods are springing up across China, along with branches of high-end consignment shops from Japan and Hong Kong that buy and sell second-hand goods, paying the seller a commission. Milan Court was one of the first pre-owned luxury stores in Shanghai when it opened eight years ago. But its owner Liu Lian says she only recently started putting her logo on the store's shopping bags because consumers used to be ashamed to be caught buying used goods. There are now signs that the stigma is melting away. Since 2009, Milan Court has posted double-digit annual sales growth, and the shop has hundreds of bags for sale, many on consignment from individuals. Ms Liu has opened six shops in Shanghai and plans to expand to other provinces. Nidia Yuan, a regular customer of Milan Court, likes the fact she can purchase unused bags at the shop for 20-30 per cent less than retail. ""I don't mind people knowing that I carry second-hand bags,"" Ms Yuan says. ""I think it is worth it to buy at those prices"". The second-hand shops should not be confused with the kind of high street thrift shops found in London or New York. Ju Geng, a second-hand shop in Shanghai's chic French concession, has shelves packed with new or barely used Gucci, Louis Vuitton and Hermès bags. They range in price from Rmb2,000 ($320) for the cheapest Gucci to Rmb400,000 for a crocodile Birkin from Hermès. Just down the road at Ms Liu's Milan Court -- housed in a European-style villa with a sun-filled garden -- the crocodile Birkin is still top of the price chain at Rmb300,000. At one branch of Japanese second-hand chain Brand Off in Shanghai's French concession, a Hermès Birkin with a child's drawing in black marker filling one entire side was priced at Rmb90,000. Ms Liu and her competitors say the people selling them handbags are not in it for the money, unlike in the west where consumers liquidate luxury items in times of economic distress. Even now, when economic growth on the mainland has slowed to 7.4 per cent, no one is emptying their closets of Gucci to feed the children. Jo Zhou, manager of Ju Geng, says the popularity of luxury thrift stores has more to do with growing sophistication than with desperation. As Chinese consumers who once thought they were too rich to buy used goods travel more, they become familiar with foreign concepts such as second-hand shops. The rise of the second-hand stores also reflects a profound shift in the taste of mainland luxury consumers. Ms Zhou says shoppers from less developed fashion markets outside Shanghai still come to her shop looking for logo-heavy products such as Gucci or Louis Vuitton. But Shanghai shoppers ""prefer to be more low profile,"" she says, noting that their favourite brands are Bottega Veneta, Prada, Céline and Hermès. The buyers are getting younger too: many are students, white collar workers at the start of their careers, or even younger, says Ms Liu of Milan Court.

"(CNN) -- Diplomacy and coalition building. Individuals working for the whole. President Obama on Tuesday stressed that's how the United States prefers to solve some of the world's most complicated issues, particularly those in the Arab world. Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, and then at a Clinton Global Initiative event in New York, Obama repeatedly tried to drive home the value of conversation rather than force. Tuesday began with Iran saying it had fired missiles into the Persian Gulf. Within hours of that claim, Obama took the podium at the annual gathering of U.N. member nations and discussed the threat of Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon. The five big issues at the U.N. General Assembly this week . ""Let me be clear,"" the president said. ""America wants to resolve this issue through diplomacy, and we believe that there is still time and space to do so. ""But that time is not unlimited."" A nuclear-armed Iran ""is not a challenge that can be contained,"" he said, adding that the scenario would ""threaten the elimination of Israel, the security of Gulf nations and the stability of the global economy,"" and trigger ""a nuclear arms race in the region."" The U.S. ""will do what we must to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon,"" Obama added, without saying specifically what that meant. Yet, echoing his 2008 campaign slogan, Obama told the General Assembly that he was ""hopeful about the world we live in."" Obama confronts Iran, Syria at U.N. Obama also offered world leaders details about U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens, who was killed this month when a mob overtook the U.S. Embassy in Benghazi, Libya. ""Chris was born in a town called Grass Valley, California, the son of a lawyer and a musician,"" he began his speech. Stevens joined the Peace Corps and taught English in Morocco. He loved the people of North Africa and the Middle East, and spent his life trying to improve their lives. Stevens was like so many foreign service workers who make tremendous personal sacrifices because they're passionate about building ""bridges across oceans and cultures,"" Obama said. ""I tell you this story because Chris Stevens embodied the best of America."" That means that the attacks in Benghazi, which also killed three other Americans, ""were attacks on America."" The violence was ""an assault on the very ideals upon which the United Nations was founded,"" he added. Read the full text of Obama's remarks . Once again, Obama mentioned diplomacy, saying the attacks offended ""the notion that people can resolve their differences peacefully; that diplomacy can take the place of war; and that in an interdependent world, all of us have a stake in working towards greater opportunity and security for our citizens."" 'Deeper causes' He said he wanted more conversation about ""the deeper causes of this crisis."" Adding more guards at embassies around the world isn't a solution, and neither is banning an anti-Muslim film that incited the chaos. The way forward, the president said, is to make sure everyone understands that America represents the freedom to say anything and express views that some might find distasteful or offensive. ""As president of our country, I accept that people are going to call me awful things every day,"" he said. ""And I will always defend their right to do so. Americans have fought and died around the globe to protect the right of all people to express their views -- even views that we disagree with."" The future should be determined by people like Stevens and not by his killers, Obama said. Time: Why Benghazi attack will blind the U.S. The best way to do that, he said, must be international coalition building. Obama tried to drive that home not only at the U.N. but at an afternoon Clinton Global Initiative event, also in New York, where he spoke about ending human trafficking. Earlier, he had signed an executive order to stem the crime, which he said victimizes more than 20 million people worldwide. ""Human trafficking ... must be called by its true name: modern slavery,"" Obama said. The order makes it possible to provide more tools and training to federal prosecutors, law enforcement, immigration judges and transportation officials, among others, to identify and assist trafficking victims. A $6 million awards challenge, supported by Goldman Sachs and Humanity United, to local communities to develop solutions to curb trafficking is also part of the order. There will also be several groups trying to formally measure and track human trafficking in the United States so that money can be precisely allocated to combat it. Obama said human trafficking ""distorts markets"" and ""endangers public health and fuels violence,"" he said. ""This is a no-brainer,"" the president said. ""This is something we should all agree on,"" whether one is a Republican or Democrat. Obama spoke directly to trafficked people. ""In the darkest hours of your lives, you may have felt utterly alone,"" he said. ""We see you."" Hope and optimism . That statement echoed a theme running through Obama's United Nations speech: hope. Despite all of the world's tragedies and wars and struggle, Obama told U.N. members, he's optimistic. ""I am hopeful about the world we live in,"" he said. He listed a string of reasons. The Iraq war is over. Troops have returned home. He noted that the U.S. continues to hand over control to locals in Afghanistan, and will bring all troops home in 2014. ""Al Qaeda has been weakened and Osama bin Laden is no more,"" Obama said. Some people have praised the Obama administration's drone strikes that have killed terrorists, though the program remains highly controversial. And the Navy SEAL operation that resulted in the death of the 9/11 mastermind represents a major victory during Obama's tenure. The president reminded listeners that it's been less than two years since a vendor in Tunisia set himself on fire to protest government corruption, triggering the so-called Arab Spring. ""I've seen hard choices made ... to put more power in the hands of citizens,"" he said, pointing out that the U.S. has supported transitions toward more open societies in the Arab world. Yet a war still rages in one Arab nation. In the past year and a half, 26,000 people have died in Syria, according to groups fighting to oust President Bashar al-Assad. Al-Assad's regime has been accused of torturing children, shooting unarmed protesters and going door to door in some villages, killing whole families. Al-Assad says that terrorists are behind the deaths. The regime ""must come to an end, so that the suffering of the Syrian people can stop,"" the president said, ""and a new dawn can begin.""

"New York (CNN) -- Volunteers toiled for hours on Friday cleaning mostly man-made debris from a New York coastline, the scattered religious offerings from a growing Hindu population in Queens. The group has drawn concern among local conservationists after leaving offerings -- clothing, statues, plastic flowers and other items -- along the Gateway National Recreation Area near Jamaica Bay. ""I was appalled to see the condition of the place,"" said New Yorker Nagassar Ramgarib, a practicing Hindu. ""It was really disgustingly filthy."" Many defend the practice, considered a sacred Hindu tradition. Millions of worshippers leave offerings to the gods at India's Ganges river each year. ""There are times when we feel that we need to come to the sea, to offer flowers and of course ... material things because we feel that flowers, they just go,"" said Esther J. Ramdeen, a spokeswoman for the East Elmhurst temple, Shiva Mandir, who helped organize Friday's clean-up. ""We see God in the sea,"" she said. What remains is a standoff between those who insist on practicing their beliefs unfettered and environmentalists who are trying to preserve the area for local marine life. Affected by the buildup and inspired by a park ranger who helped remove debris with him several years earlier, Ramgarib returned to his temple to encourage executives and its members to visit the park and see the destruction. ""It is the sea. It is something that we as Hindus worship,"" he told them, ""It is the medium that we use from this life to the after-life."" Ramgarib warned that if the area was continually polluted, his people could be banned. Kathy Krause, a supervisory park ranger of the Gateway National Recreation Area who attended the clean-up, agrees the religious practices have put definite pressure on the bay. ""It's a rich biodiverse ecosystem but it's definitively suffering some major environmental issues,"" Krause said. These extra items left on the bay are one of its biggest threats for Jamaica Bay, a national park that's home to more than 325 species of birds, invertebrates and sea life, Krause said. ""They release nutrients into the bay that don't belong there, and it exacerbates the water pollution problem we have,"" she said. Volunteers picking under rocks and through grass Friday filled garbage bags of bottles, coconut shells, figurines and yards of cloth, all of which the group says they will try to recycle. Ramdeen said the fabric, pulled and sometimes ripped from beneath the shoreline, is just another part of the material possessions offered to the gods. ""You see that the colors we're picking up are very pretty colors,"" she said ""and we as Hindus think that we should give God the best."" The material collected by Ramdeen's organization is washed before being sent back to India as clothing. ""So it was kind of a recycling process,"" she said of their efforts. ""It's amazing,"" Krause said of the group's efforts. ""This just shows such wonderful turnout from the local community.""","Conservationists, park rangers concerned about water pollution .

"(CNN) -- While dogs slurp to alleviate thirst, cats display a mastery of physical dynamics that leaves their whiskers, chin and the counter top free of liquid, researchers found. Researchers spent hours watching a feline consume liquids in order to understand the forces. They also made a robotic version of a cat's tongue and watched YouTube videos of big cats drinking. Using complicated formulas, the four-member team from Virginia Tech, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Princeton University came up with their findings, detailed Thursday in the online journal Science. Here's how a house cat, which averages about four laps per second, personifies daintiness while drinking. Cats extend their tongues straight down with the tip curled backward like a capital ""J"" to form a ladle, so that the top surface of the tongue touches the liquid first. ""The speed of the tongue is quite incredible,"" co-author Pedro M. Reis, an assistant engineering professor at MIT, told CNN. ""The smooth tip of the tongue barely brushes the surface of the liquid before the cat rapidly draws its tongue back up,"" said the researchers, who received no funding for the study. ""As it does so, a column of milk forms between the moving tongue and the liquid's surface. The cat then closes its mouth, pinching off the top of the column for a nice drink, while keeping its chin dry."" That column, they say, is a balance between gravity, which pulls the milk back toward the bowl, and inertia, which refers to the tendency of a liquid to continue moving in a direction unless another force interferes. Kitty knows how quickly to lap in order to balance these forces, according to the study, which drew on mathematics, fluid mechanics, physics and engineering. ""This suggests that cats are smarter than many people think, at least when it comes to hydrodynamics,"" writes co-author Jeffrey M. Aristoff of Princeton. Unlike humans, who can seal their cheeks to suck in liquids, dogs and cats rely on lapping, Reis said. A dog's tongue in effect forms a little cup to scoop up water. ""Cats are far more complex,"" Reis said. Their tongues don't pierce the surface of a liquid. Big cats don't lap as rapidly as house cats, the scientists said, in part because their tongues are larger. ""Lions and tigers [tongues] will go about half [the speed] of house cats,"" said Roman Stocker, an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at MIT. Reis and Stocker said one of the reasons they undertook the 3-year study was to apply the scientific method and rules of basic research about something scientists don't understand. Results of the study also may have implications for soft robotics, they said. Stocker got the idea for the study after watching his cat Cutta Cutta lap milk. Cutta Cutta, which means ""stars stars"" in an Australian aboriginal language, is the subject of several videos and photos taken by the team. Asked whether Cutta Cutta is enjoying the celebrity from the release of the study, Stocker told CNN, ""I'm not sure he realizes it.""","Unlike dogs, cats don't slurp when they drink, team finds .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Miles Levin was determined to have his say in life, even with cancer ravaging his young body. Miles Levin wrote that cancer and the fear of death could expand your heart and mind. So when he died Sunday, six days before his 19th birthday, he had blogged a lifetime of thoughts and dreams, words that somehow pierced through cyberspace and moved tens of thousands of readers to respond. Miles blogged on the Web site of Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Michigan. He isn't the only person to have written about a dying man's journey, but his wit and wisdom and choice of words, captured the imagination of his readers. His story was circulated well beyond the world of cancer patients and was told by mass media including the Detroit News and CNN. His wisdom was sought by parents of dying children, those recovering from the brink of death, even ordinary people captivated by his enjoyment of life in the face of death. In announcing his death Sunday afternoon, his family wrote: ""Miles went from a boy-man to a man-boy. At a cost that would knock your socks off, Miles still managed to pack a wallop. He could not and would not be held back ... from living life to the fullest."" Remembering Miles' gifts » . He launched his blog in 2005 simply welcoming new readers and telling them he'd been stricken by a pediatric cancer called alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, a cancer that strangles the muscle tissues. He declared that his motto would be simply: ""It's always something."" And it was. He got sick and then better and then sick again and still managed to navigate the milestones of adolescence: keeping up in school, a first serious girlfriend, college applications, prom. He became a little famous and laughed at himself. He wrote about the value of life and somehow acquired an almost supernatural ability to appreciate small pleasures such as a sunny day and the presence of a loving family. This notion that cancer and the fear of death could expand your heart and mind was adopted by readers as far away as Asia and South America. He declared that perhaps he'd been put on Earth to show people how to die of rhabdomyosarcoma with grace. When he was too sick to write, his mother, Nancy, chimed in: ""The boy Miles was in June of '05 was sweet, innocent, disorganized and ungrounded (""earth to Miles""). The man that Miles is today is clear, focused, heart centered, and purposeful. ""It was cancer that intervened. That deadly disease carried the power of transmutation, and Miles accepted the offer."" She quit her full-time job as a psychotherapist to tend to him. The Sarcoma Foundation, which advocates for better treatment of soft-tissue cancers such as his, awarded him its 2008 Leadership in Courage Award a year early. Predicting he wouldn't be around to receive it, they taped his acceptance speech. A few months ago, knowing his high school graduation was probably his last milestone, he wrote: ""I can rest assured that even if I succumb to the rogue cells, I will leave behind a legacy of victory. ""Dying is not what scares me; it's dying having had no impact. I know a lot of eyes are watching me suffer; and -- win or lose -- this is my time for impact."" He did have an impact. Fifteen-thousand bloggers were responding monthly this summer. In the end, they mostly sent him God's blessing. And they spoke of positive things like seeing the brightly shining stars on summer nights, the beauty of the will to survive, simple things that make you laugh, and the need to use words to soften the hardest of times. The funeral will be private. A public memorial service at Miles' high school, the Cranbrook School in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, is planned for November. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- The alarm in my phone fires into life at 6.30 a.m. and jolts me from my sleep. The year is 2014 and I'm recovering from jet lag after flying back to London from New York, and the time difference has got to me -- again. It's worse than usual because I didn't sleep on the plane. Too much work to do and as all transatlantic flights now have Wi-Fi, the urge to get stuff finished was overwhelming. It should be a quiet day back in the office. I say office of course, but since we all successfully worked from home during the London Olympics, bosses now understand that people can be just as productive working from home or on the go. That's helped by blanket internet coverage and better connectivity at home, on the train, and pretty much everywhere thanks to marriage of Wi-Fi hotspots and the 4G network that has been rolled out in the UK. Read related: A future with fewer mobile apps? I look down at my phone and its large Super AMOLED screen. It beeps a second time, this time with information about my day's itinerary, what the weather is like where I am, where I've got my meetings and some headlines from my favorite news sites curated and cross-polled against my social circles. I hop out of bed, flick and swipe a command on my phone and the home music system kicks into gear, instantly playing in various rooms in the house. That will wake the kids up. Read related: How mobiles of the future will get under our skin . Downstairs and breakfast is quickly under way. We're running short on milk, so I scan the carton with a shopping app on my phone. We've got until Friday before the order gets processed and sent out. Adding bits along the way is so much easier than traipsing around a supermarket. I dump my phone on the kitchen counter and it starts charging. All the surfaces in our kitchen have the ability to give power to specific devices like the kettle, toaster, tablet or phone. It's good go grab the extra juice while I can. In 2014, phone batteries are quicker to charge, but they still don't last that long. Wireless charging points help make a difference. If only Intel would get a move on and create a commercial version of the wireless power concept they showed off in 2008, devices might charge just by being in the same room! Breakfast done I've got to head into London for some meetings. The phone goes in my pocket and off I go. I get to the station and touch in through the barriers with my phone. We've come a long way from when phones displayed barcode boarding passes. Now the phone has replaced the Oyster card in London, using NFC technology embedded in the handset to confirm payments on the go. Read more: How technology makes us vulnerable . Inside the station I use my phone to buy a coffee. Papers are still around, but I don't really see the point -- it's so easy to get curated news from a vast number of sources around the world. The idea of reading news from one source -- a newsroom in east London and printed over 12 hours ago -- seems strange. On the train I start watching a TV show I recorded on the Sky box last night but didn't have a chance to watch. I'm skipping the adverts. An hour later I'm in another coffee shop about to start my first meeting. This place not only has free Wi-Fi, but also free wireless power charging spots. There used to be a time when free Wi-Fi was enough to lure me in; now I need power too. Before my contact arrives I scan our last e-mail conversation. A quick swipe to the left and the phone's operating system not only retrieves all our messages, but a number of social elements too about my contact and her employer. I discover the company she works for just announced it's laying off 3,000 workers. Could she be one of them, I wonder? The meeting goes well. I've had access to all the relevant files I've needed. All pulled from the cloud on request, of course. I have a laptop, but it rarely comes out. It's all tablet work these days, and when I do need to type something I've got a keyboard on the case. The desktop is so 2012. Read related: Could mobile apps save local news? One annoying meeting later, my phone chimes to tell me an old school friend is just around the corner. He has just checked into a local pub, so this is a great chance to see how he is. I have no idea where the pub is so I launch the finder app on my phone. It's basically an augmented reality city app that quickly draws me a map and indicates the right direction to start walking. I don't want to be holding my phone in the air looking like a tourist. A quick drink later and I've got one more meeting before heading back to the train station. The phone, knowing where I am, has automatically plotted the best route back, and instantly lets me know what the train times are. I need to hustle if I'm going to catch the one I want.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A Hindu man in Britain lost his court battle Friday for the legal right to be cremated in a traditional Hindu open-air funeral pyre. Most Hindus believe open-air burning is the spiritually . appropriate way to release a soul from the body. Davender Ghai, 70, a world-renowned charity advocate in Britain, argued the practice is already legal under British law, but he sought clarification in order to hold such cremations in the future. Ghai tested the law in 2006 when he lit the funeral pyre of a man in the northern English county of Northumberland. He was never prosecuted, but the city council in Newcastle, where Ghai lives, promptly ruled funeral pyres illegal. Ghai, currently in India receiving medical treatment for what a spokesman described as debilitating high blood pressure and diabetes, said in a statement that he was saddened by Friday's verdict and will appeal. He has said he hopes for a traditional cremation when he dies. ""I shall appeal until the very end, in the faith that my dying wish will not go unheard,"" said Ghai. ""A matter of such magnitude deserves to be heard by the highest courts in our land and I shall not tire until all legal avenues are exhausted."" Current British law forbids cremation anywhere but in a crematorium. But Ghai points to findings by Judge Andrew Collins when, in 2007, he determined Ghai's case was important enough to go to trial. Collins said case law indicates that ""burning of dead bodies in the open is not necessarily unlawful"" and that the point is arguable in court. Opponents say open-air cremation is unsanitary and hazardous to health and the environment. Calculations based on U.N. estimates of mortality rates suggest that in India alone, 50 million trees are cut down each year to create funeral pyres, generating more than 8 million tons of carbon dioxide. Ghai has said he believes the practice is a religious right for Hindus, who consider open-air cremations essential to the peace of the soul. Such cremations are sanctioned by Hindu scriptures, according to the Hindu Council UK, which supports Ghai's case. It says ancient Hindu rites stipulate that the body be cremated by means of a wood-fueled fire in an open-air facility exposed to daylight. ""We want equality, not exceptions,"" Ghai states on the Web site for his charity, the Anglo-Asian Friendship Society. ""No one expects Hindus to marry in a church, so why are Hindu funerals shoehorned through Chapels of Rest designed like Anglican churches?"" Allowing open-air cremations in Britain would also save Hindu families money, Ghai says. Many British Hindus still prefer the traditional funeral pyre ritual and choose to ship bodies to India for a proper ceremony, which can cost up to $5,000. Doing it in Britain would cost about a quarter of that amount, Ghai says. Britain's Ministry of Justice has acknowledged Ghai's case but doesn't offer much hope for his appeal. ""There are inevitably competing views on the appropriate arrangements for disposing of bodies stemming from different views about religion, morals and decency,"" it said in a recent statement. ""There's no plan to change the law on cremation.""","Davender Ghai, 70, argued the practice is already legal under British law .

"(CNN) -- Devastation is devastation, whether a hurricane rips up your home or a tornado takes the person you love most in the world. It's loss, shock and confusion. It's anger and sadness and resentment. It's being flustered like you've never been flustered before. But it's going to be OK: Take it from the people who survived Hurricane Katrina and the Missourians from Joplin whose town was leveled by the worst tornado in U.S. history. They want Sandy survivors to know a few things: . You're probably on autopilot right now. You're moving through it. Stand in the ruins of the life you had before the disaster. Understand that was before. The after is when you're good and ready. 7 ways to manage stress in a disaster . Hours will still go by though. Days will happen. You might not remember to eat because you're filling out paperwork and talking to insurance operators. You will get put on hold. Your life will feel forever on hold. At some point, when you think you're handling it, you will stumble on something that reminds you of that old life, maybe it's a thing or it's a memory. Maybe this will happen when you finally get the sleep you've gone without since the disaster. You're going to feel really, really awful again for awhile. Victims fall to Mother Nature's wrath . Make yourself anew . Eileen Romero still feels the weight on her chest. It has just gotten a little lighter in the years since Katrina. As a nurse, she saw heinous things in the hospital where she worked. Eight years on, it's hard to speak in full sentences without crying. She watched the wall-to-wall television coverage of Hurricane Sandy, transfixed by the nurses who manually pumped air into newborns after carrying the infants down nine fights of stairs at NYU Langone Medical Center. ""I was right back in that hospital in New Orleans,"" Romero said. ""I know those people. I felt that."" There are always burdens and rewards of being a caregiver. But in an emergencies, they are tenfold. ""They need to know it's going to be hard,"" Romero continued. ""I mean, they saved those babies and they should feel good. But later it might hit them what they were able to get through just because they were trained to do that. And I would tell them, 'It's alright to be upset and to take time out to understand what you've been through.' "" It was comforting to Romero to watch the coverage of Sandy. While she was in the middle of Katrina, she didn't consider that it was the world's focus for days. ""I didn't even realize that we were being covered 24 hours a day,"" she said. ""It was only months later that I comprehended that New Orleans was on TV all the time, that people cared so much about it."" Then again, there's another side to massive media coverage. People might feel obligated to talk about their pain if a reporter asks. If you don't have the words, you don't have to conjure up something for anyone. No one else has the right to your story. Tell it when and how you want. Romero became a photographer after Katrina because words kept failing her. When she tried to talk about it, her words were inadequate. ""Understand that the life you had before something like this isn't coming back, and that's not always a bad thing,"" she said. ""Discover and make yourself anew."" Interactive: Remembering the victims . Look for what's funny . Every day, Romero takes her Yorkies out for a walk. It's a simple, effortless routine that has nothing to do with bad things in the world. Find something like that, or keep doing that one, pure, sweet thing that you always did, she said. You're going to need lightness. Your sense of humor will be tested. Use it a lot. You might have to move into a place that you'd never imagined you'd ever have to live, like a trailer or someone's garage. This could last for months, maybe a whole year. Your kids, spouse, in-laws and maybe some strangers will all be crammed in there. They might snore. There are going to be fights and moments where you swear your head is gonna pop. Writer Michael Tisserand and his wife, Tami, took damage to their home in Katrina. They and their two kids -- now 11 and 14 -- moved in with a friend. ""We were laughing about sleeping in these two twin beds that were squished together,"" Tisserand recalled. ""We were getting food stamps for food banks for the first time. When you're learning about how it feels to be suddenly dependent on others, you have to look for what's funny."" Ask for help, give help . Don't be afraid to give or receive help, he said. Don't sit inside. Try not to compare your pain or loss to someone else's. You don't have to swim through your living room to say you've been through hell. Tisserand remembers being stunned and then weeping uncontrollably when he received a package from a friend. It was a new laptop. ""You will feel helpless. I just felt like I was not the agency of my life then,"" he said. ""It was so unbelievable to me that someone did that for me."" When anyone gives you anything, small or large, cheap or expensive, know that they are trying to be there for you. The Tisserands are at home in New Orleans, a city they never want to leave. For many disaster survivors, the tragedy redefines their definition of home. How to help . Take pictures of everything . Kelly Maddy grew up in Joplin, Missouri. The 29-year-old and his wife thought it would be fun to go out and chase a tornado that was set to hit in April 2011. Tornadoes got little more than a shrug in Missouri, so this wasn't really the craziest decision. It's like choosing to stay at home when there's a Category 1 hurricane forecast for your area. You've gotten through nor'easters before, so what's the harm? When the Maddys finally made it back to their house, it was kindling. Their cars were gone. ""The night was a blur,"" he said. ""You just stare and wonder what happened to my life? Then the panic."" ""Document everything,"" Maddy said. ""Every single insurance person you talk to -- and you'll be bounced around from person to person -- write their name down, write down everything they say. Use your iPhone. Take pictures of everything."" Know what supplies you have and how much you're going to need. Get that stuff soon. Don't put it off, he said. There's going to be a level of bureaucracy worse than you ever imagined. Insurance workers will be kind, of course, because it's not personal. It's just the system. Call them constantly. Don't expect them to call you, he said. The Maddys lived in a basement apartment with their animals until finally rebuilding their house in February. ""Going through all of that almost broke us,"" he said. ""Almost. 'Cause we're still here.""

"(CNN) -- A humanitarian watchdog group on Wednesday raised concerns over the U.S. military's handling of juvenile detainees in Iraq, saying ""some children have been detained for more than a year without charge or trial."" U.S. soldiers count juvenile detainees after a restroom break at Camp Cropper in Iraq in September 2007. Human Rights Watch alleges that children in U.S. custody in Iraq are being ""held without due process."" The New York-based group called on the military to release children detained for more than a year and to provide child detainees timely judicial reviews and ""prompt access to independent legal assistance and family visits."" ""In conflicts where it was not directly involved, the U.S. has been a leader in helping child soldiers re-enter society,"" Clarisa Bencomo, a children's rights researcher on the Middle East at Human Rights Watch, is quoted in the report. ""That kind of leadership is unfortunately missing in Iraq."" Bencomo said, ""The vast majority of children detained in Iraq languish for months in U.S. military custody. The U.S. should provide these children with immediate access to lawyers and an independent judicial review of their detention."" A Multi-National Force-Iraq spokesman for detainee operations defended the practices of the U.S.-led coalition and denied aspects of the report. In several instances, Maj. Matthew Morgan said that Human Rights Watch is calling upon coalition forces ""to do something that is already a matter of practice in Iraq."" However, he concurred with the report's statement that the ""arrest and detention of a child must be used only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time."" ""We could not agree more,"" Morgan said. ""Detention is a last resort, and it is carried out judiciously."" Insurgents reportedly have used some children to conduct attacks in Iraq. The Human Rights Watch paper said American military authorities were detaining 513 Iraqi children as ""imperative threats to security"" as of May 12, and has detained around 2,400 children in Iraq since 2003 -- some as young as 10. Morgan estimated the youngest detainees now are eight children who all are believed to be around age 13. ""Although specific age determinations are impossible, the remainder of the juvenile population ranges from 14 through 17,"" he added. Morgan also said the number of juvenile detainees is fewer than 500 at the moment, down from nearly 1,000 in summer 2007. Most child detainees are held at the Camp Cropper detention facility in Baghdad, where a 17-year-old boy was strangled to death by another child detainee, the report said. Others are detained at Camp Bucca near the southern city of Basra, Human Rights Watch said. As of February, the paper said, ""The reported average length of detention for children was more than 130 days, and some children have been detained for more than a year without charge or trial, in violation of the Coalition Provisional Authority memorandum on criminal procedures."" Human Rights Watch noted the memo on the security detainee process says ""any person under the age of 18 interned at any time shall in all cases be released not later than 12 months after the initial date of internment."" Morgan characterized the call for the release of children who have been detained for more than a year a ""hollow demand based on an inaccurate claim."" ""There are no juveniles in coalition force custody who have been detained for more than a year,"" he said. ""All juveniles are required to be released within one year; the majority are released in fewer than six months."" The report also listed other ""due process"" concerns: . • The military might interrogate child detainees for days or weeks before transferring them to main detention facilities, and ""they have no real opportunity to challenge their detention."" • Military advocates assigned by the U.S. to each child at a mandatory six-month detention review have ""no training in juvenile justice or child development."" • American officials allegedly said that ""children are not provided with lawyers and do not attend the one-week or one-month detention reviews after their transfer to Camp Cropper."" • The children have ""limited contact"" with their families. Morgan said that juvenile detainees do have access to family visitation, including those held in Baghdad, ""in part to make them more accessible to families and service providers."" He also said those charged under Iraqi law do have access to legal counsel, but ""those who are not referred to the Iraqi criminal courts do not have legal counsel because they are not charged with a crime."" All detainees' cases are reviewed by independent attorneys within seven days of internment, Morgan said. ""Those referred to the Central Criminal Court of Iraq are reviewed in accordance with Iraqi law. Those not referred to CCCI are reviewed in accordance with international humanitarian law,"" he added. Human Rights Watch also criticized the U.S. military for sending 200 to 300 of the 513 child detainees to Dar al-Hikmah, or House of Wisdom. The juvenile detainee education facility was opened at Camp Cropper in August 2007 with the ""stated intention to provide 600 detainees, ranging in age from 11 to 17, with educational services pending release or transfer to Iraqi custody."" Morgan said juveniles ""are given access to some of the highest quality schooling available in Iraq"" at Dar al-Hikmah. The report said an ""unknown number"" of youths have been transferred to Iraqi custody, and it made reference to a U.N. Assistance Mission in Iraq report that said children under Iraqi custody ""are at risk of physical abuse."" ""Like adults, children transferred to Iraqi custody are at risk of abuse and poor conditions of confinement. A U.S. military official in Baghdad told Human Rights Watch this month that the U.S. was delaying the transfer of 130 child detainees to Iraq's al-Tobchi juvenile detention facility because of conditions there,"" the report said. Morgan said the coalition has refrained from ""transferring physical custody of children to Iraqi authorities pending trial when there is reason to believe they will be at risk of abuse"" and that the military does separate juveniles from the greater population. ""Those with special needs such as the mentally infirm are provided medical care and placed in separate housing where appropriate for their individual case,"" he said. Other developments . • The chief security officer for the Iraqi Transportation Ministry was gunned down Wednesday on a highway in eastern Baghdad, an official with the Iraqi Interior Ministry said. Col. Abdul Karim Muhsan was killed when at least four gunmen in two cars intercepted his vehicle and shot him, the official said. • Four people were killed and 12 were wounded in two car bomb attacks Wednesday in the capital, an Interior Ministry official said.

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- The death toll in China's outbreak of hand-foot-mouth disease has risen to 42 children, with the capital Beijing reporting its first case Wednesday, state media said. Parents sit with children being treated for the virus in Fuyang, China, last month. The child died on the way to a hospital Sunday, health authorities told the Xinhua news agency. Another child died of the virus at a Beijing hospital, but that death was counted in the child's home province of Hebei, which neighbors Beijing, the news agency said. So far, the virus has sickened 24,934 children on the Chinese mainland, authorities said. All 42 people who died have been children. The deaths are blamed on enterovirus 71, or EV-71, one of the most common causes of hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD). The official count of infections has increased dramatically in recent days since an order issued late last week by the Ministry of Health mandating that all cases be reported. HFMD is not related to foot-and-mouth disease, which affects farm animals. HFMD can be caused by a number of intestinal viruses, of which EV-71 and Coxsackie A16 are among the most common. In mild cases, EV-71 causes cold-like symptoms, diarrhea, and sores on the hands, feet and mouth. Severe cases can cause fluid to accumulate on the brain, resulting in polio-like paralysis and death. There is no treatment for severe EV-71 infections nor does a vaccine exist. Adults with well-developed immune systems can usually fend off the virus, but children are particularly vulnerable to it, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Public health officials expect the number of cases to peak this summer, since the disease thrives in warm weather. The virus is a concern for Chinese officials as the nation prepares to host the Summer Olympic Games starting August 8. Taiwan had a large outbreak of HFMD in 1998 with 78 deaths, and smaller outbreaks in 2000 and 2001, according to the CDC. China is also coping with the devastation left by a magnitude-7.9 earthquake that struck Monday, killing thousands and leaving even more people trapped in debris or simply listed as missing.","Hand-foot-mouth disease has sickened 24,934 children in China; 42 have died .
Illness is caused by virus; not related to foot-and-mouth disease in animals .
There is no vaccine and no treatment for severe cases, which can cause paralysis .

"YUZHNO-SAKHALINSK, Russia (Reuters) -- A brown bear killed a tourist camping on an island off Russia's Far East coast on Thursday and was then shot by fellow campers, local police said. Bears have come into increasing conflict with humans in remote regions of Russia as their natural habitat has faced growing encroachment from both development and tourism. The man sustained ""fatal injuries as a result of the attack"" on the Bolshoi Shantar island off the Pacific Ocean island of Sakhalin, said a police spokeswoman. Local radio station Vostok Rossii said fellow campers were woken by loud growls and saw the bear kill the 36-year-old man. Other campers later shot the bear. A police team will fly to the island to investigate the incident. Two tourists were injured in similar bear attacks on the Bolshoi Shantar island this year. Both survived.  E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- It's arguably the biggest game in world football -- and Real Madrid warmed up for next Sunday's El Clasico with a five-star showing led by their talisman Cristiano Ronaldo. Ronaldo fired his 17th career hat-trick to signal his intentions ahead of next weekend's clash with arch-rivals and league leaders Barcelona and his showdown with Lionel Messi.

While Barca will provide far stiffer opposition than Deportivo La Coruna, this was still a scintillating showing from Ronaldo and Real. Deportivo had lost on its previous six visits to the Bernabeu but took a shock lead through former Real man Riki after 16 minutes. But that was as good as it got for the visitors as Ronaldo fired his first treble since April. The former Manchester United man equalized from the penalty spot before Angel Di Maria put the home side ahead. Ronaldo grabbed his second after Sergio Ramos' effort was only parried by the goalkeeper and Pepe added a fourth with his first goal in ten months.

Palermo grabbed its first win of the season as Fabrizio Miccoli scored a hat-trick to seal a 4-1 win over Chievo. Miccoli fired home a stunning 13th minute free-kick only for Chievo to hit back through Marco Rigoni. Palermo looked unlikely to hang on for a point after Franco Brienza was sent off after picking up two yellow cards. But Miccoli shocked Chievo just minutes later as he fired home his hat-trick and Palermo's third. Luigi Giorgi fired home a fourth late on to seal the win and lift Palermo off the bottom of Serie A. Bologna claimed its second win of the season after cruising to a 4-0 win against Catania. Tiberio Guarente fired home a 19th minute opener before Alberto Gilardino doubled Bologna's lead.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The White House Office of Administration is not required to turn over records about a trove of possibly missing e-mails, a federal judge ruled Monday. The White House Office of Administration is not bound by the Freedom of Information Act, a judge says. The ruling by U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly found the agency does not have ""substantial independent authority"" so it is not subject to the Freedom of Information Act. The decision means the White House does not have to disclose documents relating to its troubled e-mail system. That system developed problems that may have caused millions of White House e-mails to be unaccounted for. The watchdog organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington had sued under FOIA. The group expressed disappointment in the ruling and said it is appealing the decision. ""The Bush administration is using the legal system to prevent the American people from discovering the truth about the millions of missing White House e-mails,"" said Melanie Sloan, the organization's executive director. In January, the White House said it cannot rule out that it may have lost certain e-mails. The possibly lost e-mails are from a period in which the United States decided to go to war with Iraq, White House officials leaked the identity of CIA officer Valerie Plame and the Justice Department started a criminal investigation into who leaked the information. The White House has denied any evidence, including e-mails, have been destroyed.","Office of Administration not subject to the Freedom of Information Act, judge rules .

"New York (CNN) -- Engineers have determined a storm-battered crane that is dangling over Midtown Manhattan is securely fastened to a high-rise building under construction, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Wednesday. Crews will ""have to construct another crane on top of it in order to take down this one,"" the mayor told reporters. ""There was enormous torque when the crane fell over and the fact that those connectors have withstood the pressure just testifies to how well they were put in and how stable that tower is,"" Bloomberg said. New York after Sandy: A tale of two cities . Since Tuesday, engineers have been inside the One57 building on West 57th Street, where gale force winds toppled a crane boom some 90 stories above the city. The peculiar scene has since left many New Yorkers peering skyward as authorities secured the area and evacuated nearby buildings, including the posh Le Parker Meridien hotel. Hurricane safety: When the lights go out . The city's next step, Bloomberg said, is to shrink the emergency zone in the surrounding areas after better safeguarding the structure, which continues its slight sway high above the city. Engineers will be ""tying the boom to the building so that they can then work around the top of it"" and place safety netting around the building, Bloomberg said. After that comes the new crane boom, which will extract the damaged one. Could plugs have spared subways from flooding? The entire process could take weeks, the mayor said. The crane, damaged Monday afternoon, sits atop a building that is planned to be among the tallest residential structures in Manhattan, offering views that potentially range from Central Park to the city's Financial District. Lend Lease, which is building the tower, said the crane was inspected October 26 and that the operator left it in the correct position, as was done during previous hazardous weather, including Hurricane Irene.

"(CNN) -- It takes a disaster to remind us how much we depend on our local and state governments. In the middle of a presidential campaign, Hurricane Sandy has put Barack Obama and Mitt Romney on the sidelines, reminding us how much we count on mayors and governors to protect us, to rescue us and to keep our streets, buses, subways, airports and commuter rails running. After a season of debates about the deficit, taxes and health care, Americans have discovered that they cannot survive without government: to provide clean water, reliable transportation systems, and emergency services when floods, fires and power outages force them to abandon their homes. Hurricane Sandy even demonstrated that sometimes politicians should do more than what we want, especially when they are trying to save us from ourselves. When New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie ordered everyone out of Atlantic City, most residents ignored his request. And when New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, three days before Hurricane Sandy landed, activated the city's storm plan and issued an evacuation order for the city's high-risk Zone A floodplain, many observers thought he was over-preparing, like a grandmother urging you to wear galoshes in the rain. Opinion: Don't let superstorm sway your vote . Next time, evacuation orders will not be dismissed as examples of the ""nanny state."" Hurricane Sandy did not just erode beachfronts; it also eroded partisan political differences. How else can one explain Gov. Christie's warm and gracious comments about Obama after the president did far more than what was required when he suggested that the New Jersey Republican personally call him if he needed any help with federal agencies. Disasters never go away. They become part of our culture, providing stories of danger and heroism that we share with our children and their children. Disasters take neighbors and make them friends. New Yorkers, widely considered to be tough and selfish, are suddenly eager to share cellphones, drink beer with strangers at their local bars, and to cook meals at home -- since without subways there is no way to go out for dinner and get home easily. There is one simple lesson we can learn from Hurricane Sandy: We cannot ignore the essential infrastructure that moves people, information and goods. How you can help . These systems are under the control of mayors and governors -- not presidents, senators or members of Congress. More than two-thirds of the funds spent on transportation come from states and localities, not from the federal government. And with today's current emphasis on cutting the federal deficit, states will need to do more since the federal government is clearly in retreat, at home and overseas. It is not sufficient to have a smartphone or an iPad if we do not have resilient, robust networks that can function when we need them most, like in a disaster. It is not sufficient to have a home, if there is no power to run appliances and water to drink and cook with. And, what good is a job if you cannot get to work -- whether by car, train, bus or plane? New York has a subway system that is more than a century old. Our nation's airports control our airspace with obsolete technologies, needlessly adding to delays and pollution. And our commuter railroads rely on railroad bridges that are well beyond their shelf life. Disaster relief: Obama, Romney differ on federal role . Hurricane Sandy is not over. The damage is still being assessed. The recovery is going to be slower than we anticipate. And the losses are beyond measurement. Homes destroyed, beaches reconfigured, boardwalks that cannot be replaced, and memories that cannot be renewed. But we can recognize the vital need to invest in the future: to take steps now to minimize similar disasters. We cannot eliminate the power of ocean currents and wind and storms, but we can do more to invest in stronger, safer transportation systems that can diminish the disruptions caused by the next hurricane. Sandy certainly won't be the last of the destructive storms we encounter. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mitchell L. Moss.","Mitchell Moss: Disaster reminds us how much we rely on our local governments .
Moss: Hurricane Sandy has put President Obama and Mitt Romney on the sidelines .

"(CNN) -- A cargo jet crashed Sunday just west of Monterrey, Mexico, killing the pilot and injuring the co-pilot, a company representative said. The crash occurred at 2:15 a.m. as the McDonnell-Douglas DC-9-15 freighter approached the airport in Saltillo, Mexico, carrying a load of auto parts, said Donald McNeff, vice president of USA Jet Airlines. The National Transportation Safety Board, which confirmed the death of the pilot, reported no one was injured on the ground. The co-pilot suffered severe burns. Both the pilot and the co-pilot were U.S. citizens. The NTSB  has sent a team of investigators to assist the Mexican government in its probe of the incident. The jet's trip began at company headquarters at Willow Run Airport in Ypsilanti, Michigan, a half hour west of Detroit, McNeff said. It then flew to Hamilton, Ontario, where it picked up cargo and continued to Shreveport, Louisiana, where it cleared customs, he said. It was close to the airport grounds in Saltillo in clear weather when the crash occurred, he said. USA Jet Airlines, founded more than 20 years ago, carried cargo across the Americas, McNeff said. About five years ago it added passenger service. It has a 22-plane fleet, including the aircraft involved in the crash.","Cargo jet crashes Sunday just west of Monterrey, Mexico, killing the pilot .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A federal appeals court has slammed the reliability of U.S. government intelligence documents, saying just because officials keep repeating their assertions does not make them true. A guard looks over the U.S. military detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in this file photo. A three-judge panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington likened the Bush administration's case to a line in an 1876 nonsense poem by Lewis Carroll: ""I have said it thrice: What I tell you three times is true."" Portions of the court's findings were released a week ago, including a ruling that a Chinese Muslim accused of being a foreign fighter was wrongly imprisoned.  The full ruling was released Monday. Hazaifa Parhat is being held by the U.S. military at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba. In its ruling, the court ordered that Parhat be released or transferred, or that a hearing be held quickly to determine whether he is being held properly. The judges criticized the government for offering unsubstantiated evidence, and referred to Carroll's poem,""The Hunting of the Snark,"" in which the line is uttered by a pompous character called the Bellman. ""The government suggests that several of the assertions in the intelligence documents are reliable because they are made in at least three different documents,"" wrote Judge Merrick Garland. ""We are not persuaded. Lewis Carroll notwithstanding, the fact the government has 'said it thrice' does not make the allegation true. In fact we have no basis for concluding that there are independent sources for the documents' thrice-made assertions."" The court also ruled the military improperly labeled Parhat as an ""enemy combatant,"" marking the first time a Guantanamo Bay detainee has been given an opportunity in a civilian court to seek his release. The decision throws into serious doubt the underlying reasons for keeping Parhat in custody for more than six years. The Carroll poem is similar to many of his other works, nonsensical in nature, described by the author as an account of ""the impossible voyage of an improbable crew to find an inconceivable creature."" Carroll, who lived from 1832 to 1898, is best known for the children's fantasy ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland."" The ruling came 18 days after the Supreme Court concluded that the approximately 270 men held at Guantanamo have a basic constitutional right to challenge their detention in federal courts, another setback for the Bush administration's anti-terror and war policies. A different panel from the federal appeals court in Washington concluded last July that the U.S. military could not limit what information the courts hear when foreign detainees are challenging their imprisonment. The government had argued national security concerns gave the military the discretion to decide what documents were pertinent for judicial review. Lawyers for the Justice Department also claimed the lower court decision would ""impose extraordinary compliance burdens."" About 180 detainees have appealed their continued imprisonment and complained the government is unfairly restricting access to evidence that could clear them of wrongdoing -- evidence the men may not even know exists. Hearings known as combatant status review tribunals determine whether a prisoner can be designated an ""enemy combatant,"" and prosecuted by the military. Some legal and military analysts have likened them to civilian grand jury proceedings. Those who are designated as enemy combatants have restricted ability to challenge tribunal procedures and findings before the D.C. Circuit federal appeals court under a federal law passed in 2006, the Detainee Treatment Act. The legal issues surrounding the foreign nationals held in U.S. custody have reached greater urgency in recent months. Many of the men are in their seventh year of detention, and several have already had pretrial hearings before the military tribunal. Parhat, a Muslim of ethnic Uighur descent, is accused of attending a terror training camp in Afghanistan at the time of the September 11, 2001, attacks. He denies the charge. The Supreme Court on three occasions since 2004 has limited the government's power to detain and prosecute foreign nationals held at Guantanamo. Federal judges in Washington have met with the prisoners' lawyers in recent days, trying to coordinate an expected flood of appeals in the wake of the high court's June 12 ruling. Those judges are expected to meet privately among themselves, probably this week. The government has promised to comply with the justices' latest ruling, but President Bush said he would still consider proposing further legislation limiting the power of federal courts to oversee appeals from enemy combatants. The case is Parhat v. Gates (06-1397).","Appeals court faults government argument in case of Chinese Muslim held at Gitmo .
Just because claim is repeated doesn't make it true, court says, citing Lewis Carroll .
Suspect has been detained for six years, accused of attending terrorist training .

"(CNN) -- Nigeria's security forces have been guilty of serious human rights abuses in their efforts to crack down on the militant Islamist group Boko Haram, Amnesty International said Thursday in a new report. The report paints an ugly picture of spiraling violence, where brutal attacks carried out by Boko Haram, often against civilians, are countered by the security forces with abuses that only add to the problem, the rights group said. Read more about Boko Haram on CNN's Security Clearance blog . Boko Haram has become increasingly sophisticated in its methods in the past three years, the report said, carrying out deadly attacks across northern and central Nigeria. Some of the most notorious have targeted Christian churches, causing hundreds of deaths; markets and schools have also been bombed or burned down in attacks claimed by Boko Haram. ""The attacks targeting civilians may constitute crimes against humanity,"" the report said. Read more: Opinion: Nigeria is a sinking ship, but we must not desert it . However, the abuses by Boko Haram do not absolve the government of its responsibility to live up to its obligations under the law, the report said -- something Amnesty International alleges it is failing to do. A spokesman for the Nigerian military, Col. Mohammed Yerima, rejected the allegations in comments to CNN. ""We sincerely disagree with the report released by Amnesty International,"" he said. ""We believe that their statistical data is unfounded. They didn't interview anybody from Boko Haram, and they didn't interview us; they seemed to have just spoken to people on the street."" Read more: Suicide bomber kills 7 in Nigerian church . He also dismissed allegations made in the report that the military participated in extrajudicial killings of suspects or used torture during interrogations. ""We deny that. What would we gain from killing people like that? We don't torture, we interrogate. If they are found not to be members of Boko Haram, we release them immediately, take them back to where we picked them up and we apologize,"" he said. Read more: Why Nigerians are no longer content with 'suffering and smiling' The report, based on visits by Amnesty International researchers to northern Kano and Borno states and the Federal Capital Territory this year as well as past trips and other research, details a catalog of violent acts that have helped to create a climate of fear in the worst affected areas. Boko Haram, whose name means ""Western education is forbidden,"" is fighting to impose a strict version of Sharia law in the northern part of the country. While condemning the grave abuses committed by Boko Haram, Amnesty International said Nigeria's security forces ""have perpetrated serious human rights violations"" in their response. Read more: Nigeria arrests a suspected militant leader . ""Hundreds of people accused of links to Boko Haram have been arbitrarily detained without charge or trial; others have been extrajudicially executed or subjected to enforced disappearance,"" the report said. ""At the same time, the Nigerian government has failed to adequately prevent or investigate the attacks or to bring perpetrators to justice; and victims have not received prompt and adequate reparation and remedy. ""The cycle of attacks and counter-attacks has been marked by unlawful violence on both sides with devastating consequences for the human rights of the people trapped in the middle."" Amnesty International said it had shared its findings with the Nigerian authorities in advance as well as requesting further information on certain cases, but that it had received no response. Its researchers met with senior government officials, including the ministers for police affairs, justice and the interior, and the defense headquarters representative, the group said. Read more: Gunmen kill 23 at Nigeria market . It also ""requested but was not granted access to prisons, police stations, military and State Security Service detention facilities in the course of this research,"" the report said. In addition, researchers spoke with survivors of attacks by Boko Haram and relatives of those killed by suspected members of the group as well as those detained by the security forces and their families. In Maiduguri, in Borno state, where many of the deaths have occurred, Amnesty researchers found residents are reluctant to speak out over Boko Haram abuses for fear of reprisals. At the same time, ""the climate of fear and insecurity has forced many journalists, lawyers and human rights defenders to scale down or stop their activities, or flee the area entirely."" Residents told Amnesty that police and security forces appeared to do little to investigate or prosecute killings by suspected militants. Of those arrested, most languish in detention, and only a small number have been convicted, the report said. Opinion: Could it finally be springtime for Nigeria? Investigations have also rarely been carried out in alleged abuses by the security forces, leading to a loss of public confidence in the authorities, the report said. In one example cited in the report, ""Witnesses interviewed by Amnesty International described seeing people who were clearly no threat to life -- unarmed, lying down or with their hands over their head or cooperating -- shot at close range by the security forces."" Amnesty International also points out the challenges faced by a police force that is poorly resourced, with some officers lacking bulletproof vests or handcuffs, and has itself been a frequent target of attacks by Boko Haram. ""The failure of the government to properly equip and train the police reduces their ability to ensure their own and other people's safety. Hundreds of police, military and SSS (State Security Service) have been killed by Boko Haram since 2009. They have been shot and blown up in their stations, at roadblocks and in their homes,"" the report said. Opinion: Why are Nigerians numb to slaughter? The rights group makes a series of recommendations, with specific points addressed to President Goodluck Jonathan, the ministries of defense and justice as well as the police, security services and lawmakers. They include strengthening systems and training to ensure abuses are not carried out by security forces, and greater efforts to investigate abuse allegations and ensure the safety of witnesses. Nigeria has almost equal numbers of Christian and Muslims, with the south predominantly Christian. Boko Haram and other Muslim groups claim the north has been starved of resources and marginalized by the government of Jonathan, a Christian. From its base in Muslim-dominated northern Nigeria, Boko Haram, which has referred to itself as the ""Nigerian Taliban,"" has waged a violent campaign of bombings of Christian churches that have killed hundreds and wounded many more. There have been fewer attacks by Christian militant groups. Read more: Amnesty calls on Bahrain to lift protests ban .

"(CNN) -- Lately, Lifetime has been looking a little different. No, the network hasn't traded in the made-for-TV love stories that first charmed the network's loyal female viewers. It has, however, adopted a new slew of original programming designed to help Lifetime stay competitive in the age of reality TV. To that end, stage moms, amateur fashion designers, nannies and criminals have all found a home on the network. ""Lifetime, for years, thrived on reruns and made for TV movies that told women's stories,"" said Andy Dehnart, the editor of Realityblurred.com. ""It makes so much more sense to let real women tell their stories in reality TV shows than scripted shows. Those stories are more accessible and more consequential -- and often more entertaining."" By offering more reality programming, Lifetime is merely bearing witness to what the data continues to show -- unscripted shows bring in viewers. According to a recent report by The Nielsen Company, reality shows draw the largest share of the U.S. TV audience, 56.4% for the 2010-2011 season, up from 47.9% the year before. Lifetime has found success with ""Dance Moms,"" a reality show about young dancers and their moms, which was renewed for a second season on Tuesday. The ""Toddlers and Tiara's""-like dance show, set in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, reeled in about 1.8 million viewers its last episode. Meanwhile, about 2.4 million people tuned in for ""Project Runway"" last Thursday, a show which Lifetime acquired in 2009. ""Getting ""Project Runway"" was a good kick start,"" Dehnart added. ""It helped them figure out what they wanted to be. Networks tend to make this change when it makes sense for them. ... We're still in the early stages of this wave."" ""Project Runway"" spin-offs, including ""Project Runway All Stars"" and ""Project Accessory,"" will debut in the coming months. ""America's Supernanny,"" a new, unscripted series featuring an ""American homegrown nanny,"" and ""America's Most Wanted,"" which the network picked up earlier this month after Fox canceled it, will both air later this year, according to Lifetime's website. It's not odd to see series like ""Dance Moms"" and ""America's Supernanny,"" which draw on the formats of other successful shows, appear on a different network, Dehnart said. ""There's all kinds of duplication in reality,"" he said. ""How many Jersey-set shows do we have right now? Probably too many, but if its works and gets the demographic the network needs ... it's just borrowing another format. It hasn't all been high ratings and devoted audiences, however. Lifetime has had at least two reality flops. ""Roseanne's Nuts,"" Roseanne Barr's TV comeback, was recently canceled after its first season. The network's answer to ""Jersey Shore"" -- ""Russian Dolls"" -- also underwhelmed viewers. But it's not just about being a contender in the reality game for the network. Formerly the premiere destination for ""How I Met Your Mother"" and ""Desperate Housewives"" reruns, Lifetime has made way for all types of new original content in the last few years. ""The Client List"" will join scripted dramas like ""Drop Dead Diva,"" which was recently renewed for a fourth season, and ""Army Wives,"" which has been on the air since 2007. Jennifer Love Hewitt will star in and executive produce ""The Client List"" -- based off the network's 2010 original movie of the same name. All the new original content is why Rob Sharenow, Lifetime's executive vice president of programming, calls the network a triple threat. ""We program all three major TV genres -- reality, scripted series and scripted movies,"" Sharenow said. ""No other women's brand can say that."" ""We used to be dependent on reruns of network shows,"" he said, adding, ""Lifetime movies are legendary -- our legacy and our future."" But that doesn't mean original programming isn't important. ""Original, exciting characters bring exciting TV that people can't get anywhere else,"" he said. Originally marketed as ""Television for Women,"" Sharenow said Lifetime's current mantra, ""Connect. Play. Share"" -- which came to be in 2008 -- better embodies the network's new goal to appeal to everyone. ""I'm trying to make Lifetime acceptable to everybody,"" he said. ""I do want to have shows on the air that don't feel like they're just for women. ... In the past, it felt like a channel that men shouldn't be watching. We want to have shows that have broad appeal that can be watched by anybody."" Which might explain the network's decision to pick up John Walsh's ""America's Most Wanted."" ""'Americas Most Want definitely has an audience,"" Dehnart said. It was smart to pick it up. It has some value, too. I don't think it will be a huge hit for them, but I'm sure it will do well.""","Lifetime is not just about made-for-TV movies aimed at women anymore .
The network is gravitating towards original programming and reality shows .
Shows like ""Dance Moms"" and ""Russian Dolls"" trade on existing reality formats ."
"(CNN) -- Imagine that we were just developing spoken language for the first time. And someone came up with a new word to describe an action, thought or feeling -- like ""magnify"" or ""dreadful."" But in this strange world, the person who came up with the word demanded that anyone else who used it pay him a dollar every time the word was uttered. That would make it pretty difficult for us to negotiate our way to a society that communicated through speech. That's the way the patent wars on smartphone and tablet advances are beginning to feel to me. As a human being, I do not particularly care about Apple's recent victory in the U.S. version of its patent lawsuit against Samsung for copying its iPhone's and iPad's form and features. Now that Apple is demanding that Samsung pull eight of its products off the shelf, my only personal interest is whether the Samsung products, once banned, will become collectors' items. Will I one day want to show my grandchild the phone that dared to mimic the iPhone? News: Samsung to fight court ruling in Apple patent dispute . But while the details of legalities, and the impact to share prices, and even consumer choice, don't keep me or any of my friends up at night, there is nonetheless something creepy about Apple's suit. It's not so much that Apple -- the biggest company in the world -- has turned into a competitive monster; it's the territory that Apple's fighting over. It feels as if the technology innovation wars are no longer over one piece of technology or another, but over us humans. It's one thing for Apple to defend the look and feel of its phone -- things like the little button on the bottom, which seem obvious but are actually the result of a lengthy and painstaking design process. They may deserve a few years' exclusive on stuff like that. But when it comes to gestures, such as the now ubiquitous ""pinch and zoom"" technology through which users stretch or shrink pictures and text -- well, that no longer feels quite the same. (Apple, of course, has argued in its court case that they are the same; the company spent time and money on both sorts of research, it says, and doesn't believe the results should be copied by others.) They are gestures that may have begun on the device, but now have become internalized, human movements. When my daughter was 3, I used to watch her attempt to enact those same swipes and stretches on the television screen -- a phenomenon so prevalent that many television dealers now keep a bottle of glass cleaner handy, to clean their giant flat screens of children's fingerprints on a regular basis. CNN Money: What the Apple-Samsung verdict means for your smartphone . That's because these gestures are not simply technological innovations, but the language through which we humans are coming to navigate our way through the emerging digital landscape. We take to gestures and movements that grow out of the ones we use here in the real world. To translate them into the digital realm well requires skill, but the gestures themselves are not the typical territories -- like land masses -- over which corporations have traditionally fought. They're inside us. Usually, advancements of this sort are developed through consortia of companies. The HTML standards through which the Web is rendered are not owned by a single company, but developed together and used by everyone. Imagine if one musical instrument company owned the patent on the piano keyboard, and another on the tuning of a violin. Or what if every typewriter company had to develop its own layout of letters? What if blowing one's nose into soft disposable paper were owned by Kleenex? While Apple deserves to be rewarded for the innovations it comes up with, there's a limit to how far into our learned behaviors the company should be awarded protection from competitors. Our transition toward a digitally functioning society is no less momentous than the shift from grunters to speakers, or from speakers to readers and writers. As such, it will require an equally cooperative spirit from the people and companies who take us there. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Douglas Rushkoff.","Douglas Rushkoff : Smartphone patent wars seem about human behavior, not just phones .
He says Apple defending its home button makes sense; it's so distinctive .
But things like pinch and zoom technology may have made leap into collective consciousness .

"(CNN) -- Barcelona maintained their 100% record in La Liga on Saturday night with a memorable 3-2 win against Sevilla at the Estadio Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan. An injury-time strike from substitute David Villa preserved Tito Vilanova's side perfect start to the season after Sevilla had built a 2-0 lead. Winger Piotr Trochowski put the home side in front firing home in the 26th minute before Spanish striker Negredo doubled the lead in the 48th minute -- executing a delightful chip over the onrushing Victor Valdes after being played in by Gary Medel. A Barca fightback looked unlikely, but was given momentum five minutes later when Cesc Fabregas fired home a left-foot drive. Sevilla attempts to hang on to their lead weren't helped when Medel was shown a red card by referee Antonio Miguel Mateu Lahozâ€Ž for an apparent head butt on Fabregas in the 72nd minute. It proved a pivotal point in the game. Barcelona, aided by substitute's Thiago and Villa, surged forward in search of an equalizer which eventually arrived from the boot of Fabregas who calmly slotted home under Andres Palop after Lionel Messi had played him in. The Argentine was on hand again for the third, linking with Villa who banged home the winner deep into stoppage time. Barcelona have 18 points from six matches while Sevilla remain in fifth with 11. Real Madrid, who have just seven points from their opening five matches, play Deportivo La Coruna on Sunday. In Saturday's other matches, Valencia beat Real Zaragoza 2-0 thanks to goals in either half from Algerian midfielder Feghouli and Jonathan Viera while Malaga moved up to second with a thumping 4-0 win over Real Betis at the Estadio La Rosaleda. Joaquin opened the scoring from the penalty spot in the 13th minute before Javier Saviola doubled the lead 15 minutes later. An Amaya own-goal in the 72nd minute sealed victory but Isco added a fourth two minutes later to round off a resounding win. In Italy, Juventus consolidated their position at the top of Serie A with a convincing 4-1 win against Roma. Andrea Pirlo, Arturo Vidal and Alessandro Matri all scored in the first 20 minutes to all but seal victory. Osvaldo converted a penalty to pull one back for the visitors with 19 minutes remaining, but an injury-time goal from Sebastian Giovinco rounded off a comfortable evening for the league leaders as they edged three points clear of Napoli, who travel to Sampdoria on Sunday. AC Milan were held to a 1-1 draw against Parma at the Stadio Ennio Tardini. Stephan El Shaarawy's put the visitors ahead five minutes into the second half only for Daniele Galloppa to equalize 11 minutes later.","Fabregas scores brace as Barcelona come back from 2-0 down to win 3-2 at Sevilla .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- It isn't everyday that video from inside a routine legislative session causes an uproar big enough to force three politicians to resign all at once but that is just what happened in South India after video surfaced of Indian ministers watching what appeared to be video of a sex act on a cell phone during a debate in the house assembly. Two Karnataka State Ministers C.C. Patil and Laxman Savadi are being accused of watching porn when they were supposed to be doing the people's work. A third minister who resigned allegedly owned the cell phone with the lewd images on it. All three men deny the allegation but they have all turned in their resignations saying they did not want to embarrass their political party. ""We told our government and our party we don't want to be seen as criminals so we're happy to resign."" Savadi told a crowd of reporters. Patil, whose job it is to look after women and children's development in the state, added, ""We are requesting the speaker to conduct an inquiry. I hope we will come out with a clean chit."" The video of the ministers watching the cell phone video is topping newscasts across India. Local television news photographers who routinely attend the assembly meetings captured the images. Photographers noticed two ministers looking down at a cell phone and zoomed in to the screen to reveal what appeared to be several people involved in a sex act. Throughout the assembly meeting the ministers continued to look at images on two cell phones. The video also showed a minister flicking through a half dozen photographs of young women's faces while a debate raged over a local issue. Savadi defended himself saying he was not looking at porn but watching video of a women being raped by several men in an effort to prepare for a discussion on the dangers of rave dance parties that occur in the state. As the minister of Women and Children development, Patel made headlines in Southern India recently after being quoted saying the rise in rape cases in his state had to do with women being scantily clad. The timing of the scandal could hurt India's largest opposition party to the Congress Party-led government. The three ministers are all members of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). This is happening as citizens in India's most populous state begin voting in state elections. Karnataka's Chief Minister D.V. Sadananda Gowda said, ""The ministers have not made any mistakes. They have voluntarily submitted their resignation, and I have accepted that."" The three ministers are calling for an investigation saying it will clear their names but for the time being they are stepping down.

"(CNN) -- The racism row involving a Premier League referee could dominate English football headlines for some months, after police announced on Tuesday that they had launched an investigation into the incident. Mark Clattenburg, who took charge of Chelsea's controversial 3-2 home defeat by Manchester United on Sunday, is alleged to have made ""inappropriate"" comments to two Chelsea players, one of which is claimed to have had a racial nature. The footballers in question are midfielders John Obi Mikel of Nigeria and Juan Mata of Spain. If the police inquiry escalates to a formal charge for Clattenburg, there is unlikely to be any ruling until well into next year. It took nine months for John Terry to be cleared by a criminal court in London after the Chelsea captain was accused of racially abusing Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand in October 2011. The English Football Association, which launched its own investigation into the Clattenburg affair on Monday, subsequently found Terry guilty of racial abuse, banning the 31-year-old for four matches as a result. ""An investigation has been launched into alleged comments made during a football match between Chelsea FC and Manchester United FC at Stamford Bridge on 28 October 2012,"" read the London police force statement. ""This follows on from a complaint received by the Metropolitan Police Service on 29 October. ""Officers ... are in liaison with Chelsea and the Football Association. At this time, the MPS has not received any complaint from either Chelsea or the Football Association."" Peter Herbert, a leading human rights barrister who chairs the Society of Black Lawyers and who has recently staged talks over a black footballers' association in light of recent racism scandals in the English game, says he made the complaint to the police. ""What we don't want is for it to be swept away under the carpet,"" he told British broadcaster Sky Sports. ""It must be subject to a full and proper investigation. It is to lend some seriousness and some weight behind what is happening in football."" The FA's decision to run its own inquiry at the same time as the police investigation has been welcomed by Gordon Taylor, the chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association, who is keen for the incident to be resolved far quicker than the Terry affair. Meanwhile, Clattenburg, who refereed the Olympic Games football final in August and who has welcomed the FA inquiry, has been stood down from the elite panel of referees set to officiate Premier League games this weekend. The 37-year-old has already filed what is known as an ""extraordinary incident report,"" which is believed to deal with an alleged confrontation that took place in the referees' room after the final whistle. The UK Press Association reported that Mikel accused Clattenburg of abusing him during the post-match conversation, which was observed by Chelsea manager Roberto Di Matteo, assistant manager Eddie Newton and chief executive Ron Gourlay. On Tuesday, newspaper reports suggested that neither Mikel nor Mata heard any abusive comments but were informed of them later by their teammates. Clattenburg and his three assistants were all wearing microphones and earphones, but FIFA rules do not permit the recording of such conversations as there is no provision for this in the laws of the game.","Police will investigate allegations of racial abuse by Premier League referee Mark Clattenburg .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Who said LEGO is just child's play? The New Orleans Public Library asked Nathan Sawaya to build this sculpture to celebrate the city's rebirth. Since CNN spoke with LEGO artist Nathan Sawaya a year ago, his popularity has skyrocketed. Just check out his clientele. Donald Trump recently asked Sawaya to create a replica of the new hotel he's building in Dubai. With 10 days to complete it, and only architectural renderings to work from, Sawaya toiled away in his Manhattan studio snapping tiny bricks together, barely sleeping, to finish the curvy 10-foot statue in time for its unveiling. His work has also created a, well ... buzz with entertainers. Sawaya built a 4-foot bumblebee for Fall Out Boy's Pete Wentz to offer his new bride, Ashlee Simpson, as a wedding gift. Stephen Colbert wanted a piece of the action too. The comedian invited Sawaya on his show last August to present a life-size LEGO Colbert replica. ""He loved it,"" says Sawaya. ""He called it actual art!"" While being recognized as an artist -- rather than a hobbyist -- hasn't been easy for Sawaya, some of his more evocative pieces appear to be breaking down barriers.

""I think we've been able to introduce the concept that [Sawaya's sculptures] are not just toys,"" said Rosa Portell, curator at the Stamford Museum & Nature Center in Connecticut, where Sawaya's exhibition ""The Art of The Brick"" is on display through the summer. ""These are actually artworks done by an artist who just happens to work in a medium with which [people] are familiar."" ""The Art of The Brick,"" one of two of Sawaya's collections touring North America, features ""Red,"" ""Blue"" and ""Yellow,"" three life-size pieces depicting human forms in startling poses that have brought Sawaya much attention and praise.   Watch the LEGO artist at work » . The other exhibit on display -- at the Art and Culture Center of Hollywood, Florida -- shows 20 pieces he built over the past year. Sawaya says one of those pieces, ""Grasp,"" was inspired by his frustration with people who have doubted his ability to make a full-time career out of LEGO sculpting. It seems the joke's on them. Sawaya, a former attorney who said, ""The worst day in the art studio is still better than the best day in the law firm,"" couldn't be busier, with commissions pouring in from all around the world. CNN's Shanon Cook caught up with him to see how things were going. CNN: How does being a LEGO artist pay now? Sawaya: Fortunately, being an artist doesn't mean starving ... as some might think. Luckily, my work is in high demand, and the sculptures are selling for tens of thousands of dollars. CNN: Do you hope that LEGO becomes ""art,"" treasured for centuries? Sawaya: One would have to be awfully arrogant to assume their work would be treasured for ages. Right now, I hope my work captivates people for as long as I can keep their attention. CNN: Was it at all intimidating being asked by Donald Trump -- a builder himself -- to whip up a replica of his Dubai project? Sawaya: I have yet to be intimidated by a project. I believe I can create anything! I'm always excited when celebrities request commissions. It reminds me that everyone has played with LEGO at some time in their lives. Being commissioned by Mr. Trump was another fantastic opportunity to grab people's attention. CNN: What's the most unusual request you've received? Sawaya: I get hundreds of commission inquiries every month. Some wacky, some fun. The most unusual might be when I was asked to build the large bumblebee as a wedding gift from a rocker boy to his pop princess bride. CNN: That doesn't sound particularly romantic ... Sawaya: What's more romantic than a giant bumblebee?! (laughs) I think they have a little history there about bumblebees, so I was happy to make it happen for them. CNN: Why do you think people ask you to build such wacky things out of LEGO? Sawaya: I think people have passion for different things in their lives and they want to display that passion in a unique way. There are very few people in the world who can say they own a larger-than-life piece of art made out of a toy! CNN: What's the most frustrating aspect of your work? Sawaya: Not having enough time to create everything I want to. Right now, I have more ideas than I have time. CNN: Yes, your work seems to require you to do a lot of traveling. How do you find time to work on these pieces, or work on the next exhibition? Sawaya: It's been really tough. As I'm becoming more and more in demand, it's hard to find time to actually just stay in the studio, and that's why it's so important to me that when I am in the studio, I'm just working at all hours. CNN: Last time we spoke, you said your fingers get very sore from snapping LEGO Bricks together. How are your hands doing? Sawaya: My hands are doing just fine, thanks. They're a little rough around the edges, but that's part of the job. CNN: Do you think they're going to fall off at some point? Sawaya: Hands are very important to me in everything I do. I'm a creator with my hands more than anything, and so I actually did a sculpture called ""Hands,"" which is a large gray figure who's lost his hands. They're just piles of LEGO Brick. It's Nathan Sawaya's nightmare!","Nathan Sawaya makes his living as a LEGO artist .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Big divisions are appearing among the key players responsible for the eurozone's tough austerity program. The International Monetary Fund and the European Commission are at odds over which is the best way forward. As millions of Europeans feel the biting impact of austerity measures, IMF boss Christine Lagarde says it's time to hit the brakes. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble says changing directions now would lead to a critical loss of confidence in the whole plan. And European Commission Vice President Olli Rehn says the IMF's findings ""can be disputed."" It started on Monday when the IMF said that specific debt reduction targets, which underpin most of the austerity programs in place across recession-ravaged Europe, have a much deeper impact that expected. New IMF research says that pruning a budget deficit by one percentage point could mean a cut in economic growth of between 0.9% and 1.7%. That is up to three times more severe than the current economic models suggest. In other words, debt reduction is having a much more severe affect on growth than first thought. It's led Lagarde to say that the austerity programs should not focus on specific targets and that countries should be given more time to cut their debt. Schäuble shot back the next day. He told the Financial Times ""when there is a certain medium-term goal it doesn't build confidence when one starts going in a different direction."" ""When you want to climb a big mountain and you start climbing back down the mountain, then the mountain will get even higher,"" he said. Next to weigh in was Olli Rehn. He told me today that he was not yet buying the IMF argument. ""The findings can be disputed and I am looking forward to extensive negotiations on this,"" he said. ""Even the IMF can be open to criticism -- it does not have the final word."" So, a needed debate or a dangerous split? Rehn, ever the diplomat, says he sees this as a sign of ""healthy policy debate over the right course of action."" But he does support the German view. ""He (Schäuble) has a point. The EU cannot be making swift turns, rather it is a convoy and you have to carefully consider which policy turns are best."" The EU will produce its own conclusions about the impact of austerity measures next month. Whether that brings us any closer to a consensus is hard to judge. Remember the old joke about economists: if you laid all the economists in the world end-to-end you still wouldn't reach a conclusion. But this is no joking matter. Millions of Europeans have fallen into poverty or at least economic hardship as a result of the current austerity programs. Getting the right mix of policies to deal with the crisis not an option, it's an imperative.","Divisions are appearing among key players responsible for the eurozone's austerity program .

"New York (CNN) -- Monday marked the end of debate at the 67th session of the U.N. General Assembly, where some of the most-controversial speakers spoke last. Here are a few things we learned: . 1. The Syrian government is not backing down. Foreign Minister Walid Moallem took to the lectern to defend his country's handling of the 19-month crisis, which has spiraled into a civil war. He accused ""some well-known countries"" of pursuing ""new colonial policies"" under the guise of humanitarian efforts, and blamed Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Libya and others for ""arming, funding, training and harboring armed terrorist groups."" International calls for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down are a ""blatant interference in the domestic affairs of Syria,"" the foreign minister said. Approximately 28,000 people have been killed in the conflict, according to the opposition, and hundreds of thousands have been forced from their homes. ""While my government is working hard to meet the basic needs of citizens who have been forced by the violence of armed groups to flee their homes, some have sought to fabricate a refugee crisis in neighboring countries through inciting armed groups to intimidate Syrian civilians at border areas and forcing them to flee to neighboring countries,"" said Moallem. U.N. debate this year largely centered around the conflict in Syria. Most of the international community condemns the government there, but can't agree on how to stop the bloodshed. Strong U.N. Security Council action has been blocked by longtime Syria supporters, Russia and China. 2. Cuba slams the U.S. embargo, which has been in place for more than 50 years. Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez railed against his country's northern neighbor, blasting the embargo that was put in place in 1960. Cuba attributes much of its economic woe to the embargo, which it calls ""the blockade."" Rodriguez said the policy has caused ""invaluable human and economic damage,"" and accused President Barack Obama of breaking promises he made in 2009. ""The U.S. policy towards our region, whether under Democrat or Republican governments, is essentially the same. The promises made by the current president ... were not fulfilled,"" he said, referring to Obama's initial pledge to lower some of the barriers in Cuban-American relations. In 2009, the U.S. Treasury Department lifted some restrictions on the ability of Cuban-Americans to visit relatives in Cuba and send them money, but the United States has kept key components of the embargo in place. The continued imprisonment of U.S. contractor Alan Gross, who was jailed in 2009 on suspicion of espionage, is thought to be the most recent reason why relations are not improving. ""The United States do not have the slightest moral or political authority to judge Cuba,"" Rodriguez told delegates. 3. The head of the North Korean delegation says a spark could set off war on the Korean Peninsula. Vice Foreign Minister Pak Kil-yon addressed delegates amid ever-present pressure on his country's nuclear program. He criticized the United States, claiming it wants to occupy the Korean Peninsula and use the region as a ""stepping stone for realizing its strategy of dominating the whole of Asia."" ""Today, due to the continued U.S. hostile policy towards DPRK, the vicious cycle of confrontation and aggravation of tensions is on ongoing phenomenon on the Korean Peninsula, which has become the world's most dangerous hotspot where a spark of fire could set off a thermonuclear war,"" Pak said. He recalled the December death of longtime leader Kim Jong Il. Kim Jong Il's son and chosen successor, Kim Jong Un, has taken over as ""supreme leader,"" though the level of his influence on policy decisions remains unclear. Pak also made mention of the country's recent rocket launch. In April, North Korea launched a rocket, which failed less than two minutes into the flight. It said the launch was to put a satellite into orbit, but much of the international community saw it as a cover-up for testing ballistic missile technology. The move destroyed a deal reached in February under which Pyongyang agreed to suspend its nuclear activities in exchange for food aid shipments from the United States. ""The United States took issue with our legitimate and peaceful space launch that followed the universal, international law and forced the U.N. Security Council to adopt an unjust statement,"" Pak said. North Korea has been virtually isolated from the world by international sanctions over its development of a nuclear program.","NEW: North Korea calls the Korean Peninsula the ""world's most dangerous hotspot""

"(CNN) -- Tonga's king is giving up most of the near-absolute power that his family has held for centuries in the South Pacific nation, the country's news agency reported Monday. The royal dynasty currently headed by King George Tupou V was founded in 1845. King George Tupou V will let the prime minister guide the day-to-day governmental affairs, Tonga Now reported. He will continue to hold on to judicial powers, including the ability to appoint judges and commute prison sentences. George V, 60, announced his plans as the country prepares a days-long coronation ceremony that begins Friday. The decision, he said, is meant to prepare the country for parliamentary elections in 2010. Tonga, with a population of 119,000, is the only monarchy that remains in the Pacific. Currently, the king appoints the prime minister and 12 to 14 Cabinet ministers. Noble families choose nine others. Voters elect just nine. ""(He) is voluntarily surrendering his powers to meet the democratic aspirations of many of his people,"" the news agency said. ""They see Tonga's royal heritage as integral to the country's culture and identity, but favour a more representative, elected Parliament. The king agrees with them."" Tonga has for years promised to pave the way toward a democratically elected parliament, but reforms have been slow in coming. George V ascended to the throne after the death of his father in September 2006, and promised to speed up the changes. Two months later, a pro-democracy rally in the capital city of Nuku'alofa led to riots that left eight people dead and the central business district in ruins. Closing a session of Parliament a week later, the king said, ""Let us rebuild a new capital and a new Tonga."" The announcement, the news agency said, is part of that promise. Already this year, two other countries saw the end of monarchy. In March, Bhutan held elections that ended more than 100 years of royal rule in the South Asian nation and transformed it into a democracy. Two months later, neighboring Nepal declared itself a republic following the elections for a new Constituent Assembly that abolished a 239-year monarchy. Tonga is an archipelago of 171 islands directly south of Western Samoa. Less than a third of the islands are inhabited. The present dynasty was founded in 1845 after the Tongan islands were first united.","New Tongan king, George Tupou V, to give up most of near-absolute powers .

"SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (CNN) -- The Dominican Republic is a tourist paradise, and a drug runner's haven. More than 800 miles of stunning turquoise coastline used for snorkeling -- and smuggling. What's smuggled mostly is cocaine from South America, bound for the United States. And in recent years, it's been pouring in. The Dominican Republic's rocky coastline makes it difficult for anti-drug units to operate. ""The problem in the last two years is the amount of narcotics arriving in this country by air has increased exponentially,"" said Peter A. Reilly, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's supervisor in the Dominican Republic. Officials say the number of flights carrying drugs onto Hispaniola, the island shared by both the Dominican Republic and Haiti, has gone up roughly four-fold in just four years and that about 10 percent of U.S.-bound cocaine is now shipped through Hispaniola. One of the reasons is that there is little to stop the drugs from arriving. There are lots of places for smugglers to hide along the sparsely populated coastline. The rocky cliffs along the shore make it particularly difficult for drug response teams to operate.  Watch the challenge of fighting increased drug smuggling » . The nation's anti-drug force -- the Dominican National Drug Control, known here as the Direccion Nacional de Control de Drogas -- is also struggling to keep up. ""They don't have the necessary resources to combat this problem,"" Reilly said. Even with greatly increased drug flights, the Dominican Republic has no radar to track the incoming planes. The Dominican Navy has half a dozen fast boats, but they're not always available to fight the drug war. The drug control agency does have eight Vietnam-era Huey helicopters, but they don't have night-vision capability -- a major problem when most drug drops are made at night. What's more, those helicopters have limited offshore flying capabilities. ""Because they only have one engine, and because of security reasons, the helicopter cannot fly out more than five miles,"" said Gen. Ramirez Ferreira, the head of the Dominican Republic's anti-drug agency. ""So if you have a water drop 20 miles out, that helicopter can't respond."" Many of those drug flights come from Venezuela carrying Colombian cocaine, U.S. officials say.  See the route officials say drug traffickers use to the United States » . The number of drug smuggling flights from Venezuela to Hispaniola increased by 167 percent from 2005 to 2006, according to the most recent U.S. State Department International Narcotics Control Strategy Report. Venezuela's president, Hugo Chavez, outlawed U.S. anti-drug air patrols over his country two years ago, accusing DEA agents of spying. A new permissive atmosphere in Venezuela has led to lax enforcement and increased trafficking, especially with drug flights to Hispaniola, say U.S. officials. Venezuela disputes this charge, and on Tuesday announced plans to create a new counter-drug police force to fight corruption and stem cocaine smuggling. But that may take time. And meanwhile, in Hispaniola, the U.S. DEA and local drug agents are up against the huge surge in drug flights. As bad as it seems, the Dominican Republic is still in better shape than its island partner, Haiti, which suffers from severe corruption and political instability -- many experts believe it is on the verge of total chaos. ""Haiti's struggling police force, dysfunctional judiciary system, corruption, a weak democracy and a thriving contraband trade contribute to the prolific use of Haiti by drug traffickers as a strategic point of distribution,"" the State Department's report said. Gen. Ramirez Ferreira, a two-star general in the Dominican Army, has just secured the purchase of eight airplanes from Brazil to intercept drug flights. And the general says he's just cleaned his ranks of about 3,000 corrupt drug agents, replacing them with young, untainted agents right out of school. The fruits of the new push are evident. CNN was shown a closet full of just-seized cocaine and other drugs. Lying on the floor, in a pile of large suitcase-size sacks stuffed with white powder, were about 130 kilos of pure cocaine just taken in this weekend. It was dropped from an airplane to a waiting fast boat before it was seized by DR agents. The Dominicans have seized more than 1,000 kilos, or 1 metric ton, of drugs so far this year -- most of it cocaine. That's still behind last year's pace when DR agents seized an estimated 5 metric tons of cocaine. The new efforts may all be just baby steps, but the DEA is trying to help the Dominican Republic's drug squads get up and running, by lending resources and personnel. In a remote, windy and desolate stretch of desert landscape in the southwest center of the country, lies a crude airstrip used by drug runners to make drops. Dominican authorities didn't even know it existed until the DEA observed a drug drop there. The airstrip, which looks more like a little used jeep road, is far from any towns or army bases, officials told CNN. ""We're about an hour away by land from the closest detachment we have in the nearest town,"" said Lt. Col. Luis Castillo in charge of the Dominican's drug transportation unit. With the surge in drug flights, it's hard for the Dominican Republic to stop the drugs from getting in, and it's also hard to stop the drugs from getting out to the next stop in the drug pipeline -- Puerto Rico.

"(CNN) -- It may seem straight out of Moby Dick, but a rare white whale is thrilling Australians off the eastern coast. The albino humpback has been nicknamed ""Migaloo"" by researchers who track his movements. Albino whales are rare and Migaloo is the only documented all-white humpback adult, according to Peter Harrison, director of marine ecology research at Southern Cross University in Australia. Migaloo was first seen in 1991 when he was a juvenile, Harrison says, and researchers believe he is now in his 20s. The humpbacks are on their annual migration from their breeding grounds along the Great Barrier Reef back to feed in the Antarctic. ""Everyone here is quite excited,"" says Oskar Peterson, who runs a website that tracks sightings of white whales around the globe. ""We see him almost every year now, but it's still front page news when he turns up."" Migaloo is expected to pass by Cape Byron, the easternmost point in Australia, in the coming hours after passing by Surfer's Paradise, Peterson says. Spotters of the whale share sightings at his website . Male humpbacks can travel up to 140 kilometers (87 miles) a day during their migration, according to experts. But they often hang around Cape Byron searching for mates, so whale watchers may see the albino humpback for a few more days, Harrison says. He warns fans to steer clear -- at least 500 meters away at all times -- to ensure the whale's survival. Too much noise and chasing can disturb him and cause him to use precious energy he needs for migration. Whale watchers may be able to enjoy Migaloo for decades. Humpback whales are believed to survive as long as 90 years in the wild, Harrison says.","The albino humpback's nickname is ""Migaloo""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Aides to then-Attorney General Alberto Gonzales improperly considered political affiliations and ideologies in hiring, but Gonzales was unaware of those actions, according to results of an investigation released Monday by the Justice Department internal watchdog. The report cited White House liaison Monica Goodling as the key operative behind many of the political moves. The report provides no indication criminal laws were violated but cites illegal civil actions involving discrimination in hiring. Investigators, however, said no penalties are likely because the aides no longer work for the Justice Department. Monica Goodling, the White House liaison for the attorney general, was the key operative behind many of the politicized decisions involving career prosecutors and immigration judges, the report says. ""The evidence demonstrated that Goodling violated department policy and federal law and committed misconduct by considering political or ideological affiliations"" in Justice Department appointments, the report says. Investigators found Gonzales was oblivious to what Goodling was doing. ""When we interviewed him, Gonzales stated that he was not aware at the time that Goodling used political factors in assessing candidates for career positions ... and was not even aware that Goodling's portfolio in the Office of Attorney General included the hiring of immigration judges,"" the report said. Gonzales' attorney, George Terwilliger, issued a statement defending Gonzales' lack of knowledge about the actions of his top aides. ""It's simply not possible for any Cabinet officer to be completely aware of and micromanage the activities of staffers, particularly where they don't inform him of what's going on,"" Terwilliger said. In a brief statement, Gonzales said, ""Political considerations should play no part in the hiring of career officials at the Department of Justice."" Goodling, who resigned from the Justice Department last year, may have jeopardized her ability to practice law. An official close to the investigation says state bar associations have inquired about Goodling's actions, and could choose to take away her law license. The report says in one case Goodling discriminated against a female assistant U.S. attorney on the basis of her sexual orientation. Goodling's attorney, John Dowd, had no comment on the report. The 140-page report represents the culmination of a yearlong investigation by the department's inspector general and the Office of Public Responsibility, which monitors the conduct of Justice Department attorneys. Gonzales was among 85 individuals interviewed by investigators, but Goodling refused to be interviewed. Goodling's only public comments were made in May 2007 before a House Committee, which granted her immunity from potential prosecution. In her testimony, Goodling admitted that some of her decisions ""may have been influenced in part based on political considerations."" Kyle Sampson, former chief of staff to Gonzales, also came in for criticism for considering politics in hiring, as did Goodling's predecessors, Susan Richmond and Jan Williams, who served as White House liaison. Sampson's attorney, Brad Berenson, said the report shows that in some cases Sampson interceded to prevent political considerations. ""With respect to (selection of) immigration judges, he believed in complete good faith that they were not career civil service positions and that political criteria could be taken into account,"" Berenson said. When Sampson later learned he was incorrect, he supported correcting the process, he said. Former top White House official Karl Rove received only a passing mention in the report. Sampson noted Rove was a ""supporter"" of a particular candidate who applied for a position as an immigration judge. The only individual cited for misconduct who remains with the Justice Department is John Nowacki, who told superiors Goodling had not used political affiliation to select candidates when he knew that she had done so. Nowacki, who is currently detailed to Iraq, could be subject to disciplinary action. Attorney General Michael Mukasey, who replaced Gonzales, promptly issued a statement saying he was ""disturbed"" by the findings, and vowed to ensure that ""the conduct described in this report does not occur again at the department."" ""It is crucial that the American people have confidence in the propriety of what we do and how we do it, and I will continue my efforts to make certain they can have such confidence,"" Mukasey said. Democratic leaders with oversight of the Justice Department said the report reflects widespread political excesses. ""It is now clear that these politically rooted actions were widespread and could not have been done without at least the tacit approval of senior department officials,"" said Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont. House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers, D-Michigan, said the report shows ""systematic violations of federal law."" ""The report also indicates that Monica Goodling, Kyle Sampson, and Alberto Gonzales may have lied to the Congress about these matters. I have directed my staff to closely review this matter and to consider whether a criminal referral for perjury is needed,"" Conyers said. Lawyers for Goodling on Monday issued a statement rejecting Conyers' assertion that she may have lied. ""In light of Ms. Goodling's exceptional candor and cooperation, it is outrageous for Chairman Conyers ... to suggest that she 'may have lied to the Congress,' "" the lawyers said. The legal team, led by Washington attorney John Dowd, noted Conyers had twice thanked Goodling when she concluded her testimony for ""getting us closer to the truth of the serious matters we have been investigating."" The lawyers said Goodling admitted in testimony that she ""crossed the line"" in considering political factors in hiring. Gonzales' lawyer, George Terwilliger, similarly challenged Conyers for his suggestion of possible perjury and, in a letter to him, demanded he ""retract the suggestion."" The new report indicates its findings represent the second of four installments of the wide-ranging investigation of the politicization of the Justice Department. The two remaining reports, expected later this year, will focus on hiring in the Civil Rights Division and the results of the probe into the firing of several U.S. attorneys.","NEW: Ex-aide's lawyers reject congressman's suggestion that she may have lied .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A U.S. Navy submarine leaked trace amounts of radioactive water for two years as it made port calls in Japan and other Asian nations, the Navy said Thursday. The USS Houston arrives in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, for routine maintenance, during which the leak was found. Last week, Navy officials told Japan that the USS Houston, a Los Angeles-class fast attack submarine, had made one port call -- in March -- while leaking the contaminated fluid. But after reviewing records of the sub, the Navy told Japanese officials Thursday that the Houston had been leaking much longer, since June 2006, and had made port calls to Japanese bases at Sasebo, Yokosuka and Okinawa before the leak was discovered. Officials also have told the governments of Malaysia and Singapore that the sub made port calls to those countries while leaking the radioactive water, Navy officials said. The Houston also made stops in Guam and Hawaii.  See a map of the submarine's travels » . A Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman said Tokyo appreciated the United States reporting the new information promptly. ""At the same time, what remains to be nailed down is the cause,"" said the spokesman, Hiroshi Suzuki. ""We still need to get to the bottom of the cause of this leak. We would like to get a full explanation."" Suzuki said the U.S. government has assured Japan it is taking all precautionary measures to guarantee safety. In addition, Japan also conducts round-the-clock monitoring of U.S. vessels in Japanese ports. The U.S. Navy said Thursday that the leak was minor in both volume and radioactivity, and that the radioactivity from the leaks in all foreign ports added up to less than that found in a smoke detector. The problem was discovered last month when a buildup of leaking water popped a covered valve and poured onto a sailor's leg while the submarine was in dry dock. A subsequent investigation found a valve was slowly dripping water from within the nuclear power plant onboard, but it was not water that came in direct contact with the nuclear reactor, Navy officials said. The water reportedly was so low in radiation it was barely detectable. Officials with knowledge of the incident could not quantify the radiation level but insisted it was ""negligible"" and an ""extremely low level."" The total amount of radioactivity that leaked while the sub was in port in Guam, Japan and Hawaii was less than a half of a microcurie (0.0000005 curies), or less than what is found in a 50-pound bag of lawn and garden fertilizer, the officials said. The sailor who was doused, a crew member of the Houston, tested negative for radiation from the water, according to Navy officials. While Japan and the United States have come to agreements to allow nuclear-powered ships to make port calls in that country, the decision was a not a popular one in Japan. The Houston incident comes at a time when the Navy is trying to smooth over another problem with a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. The USS George Washington was due to replace the aging, conventionally powered USS Kitty Hawk this summer as the sole U.S. carrier based in Japan. While en route to Japan this May, a fire broke out on the George Washington, causing $70 million in damage. The fire was blamed on crew members smoking around improperly stored flammable materials. There was no damage or threat to the nuclear reactor, but the ship was diverted to San Diego, California, for repairs. It is expected to arrive in Japan at the end of September. The Navy fired the George Washington's captain and his deputy last week, saying an investigation into the fire led to a lack of confidence in the leadership of both men. Three weeks ago, thousands of Japanese protested the pending arrival of the George Washington. CNN's Kyung Lah contributed to this report.","NEW: Total radiation leaked less than that found in a smoke detector, Navy says .

"(CNN) -- Diplomats attending the U.N. General Assembly used the spotlight and worked the sidelines in an attempt to make headway toward resolving the Syrian crisis as a graphic video emerged Friday that underscored the consequences of failure to do so. ""What has the international community done to stop this carnage?"" asked Turkey's foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu. ""Literally nothing. We have yet to see a single effective action to save innocent lives."" The inability of the Security Council to act, he said, ""encourages the Syrian nation to kill even more people."" Turkey is providing shelter for 90,000 Syrian refugees, but the rest of the world needs to do its share, Davutoglu said. ""Our inability to act becomes a tool in the hands of despots and destructive regimes to demolish the cities, towns and villages, massacre civilians and make a mockery of the civilized world and the United Nations."" German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle also slammed the U.N. Security Council for failing to end the violence. World leaders working for robust action against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime have hit a brick wall at the Security Council after Russia and China blocked tough resolutions. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Moscow supports the right of people to determine their own destiny and to decide how they want to be governed. ""We believe it is particularly important to carry out those transformations in a nonviolent way and without outside interference,"" he said. He accused those who insist on a cease-fire only by the Syrian government with encouraging the opposition. ""In doing so, they push Syria even deeper into the abyss of bloody internecine strife,"" he said. ""Russia resolutely condemns any violence, wherever it comes from, and is convinced that there is still an opportunity to undertake collective actions,"" he added. But Westerwelle told the assembly that the ""deadlock"" in the body ""must not continue."" ""To this very day, the Security Council has failed to live up to its responsibility for people in Syria,"" he said. The U.N. peace initiative this year, led by former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, failed. But Westerwelle supported the efforts of his successor, Lakhdar Brahimi. ""Despite the escalating violence and despite the deadlock in the Security Council, we must not stop working on a political solution,"" the German diplomat said. The Security Council's failures to take tough action has led dozens of Western and Arab nations -- including the United States, Australia, Canada and Turkey -- to form an initiative called the Friends of Syria. The group comprises dozens of countries working for regime change. In addition to hosting a meeting of the group on Friday, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced $30 million for humanitarian aid and $15 million to unarmed opposition groups. Here are the latest developments in the Syrian crisis. Chemical weapons moved in Syria . The Syrian government has moved chemical weapons at various sites for security reasons, the U.S. defense secretary said Friday. There has been ""limited movement"" at Syria's major chemical storage sites, Leon Panetta said in response to questions from CNN's Barbara Starr. But U.S. officials have said they believe that the stashes remain secured by the Syrian military. Panetta added that the United States and other countries are monitoring the sites. ""We are working with countries in the region to ensure that we have the best information possible with regards to the sites and how they are being secured,"" he said. Violence flares in Aleppo, Damascus . As world leaders huddled at the United Nations, shelling and gunfire rang out Friday in Syria's largest city. Government forces clashed with opposition fighters in Aleppo hours after the launch of a ""decisive battle"" to expel regime soldiers, opposition activists said. At least 166 people were killed Friday, including 57 in Aleppo, according to the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria. A YouTube video said to have been shot in Aleppo and distributed by the LCC showed a boy laying on a table. His left arm had been severed at the elbow; his intestines protruded through a massive wound in his stomach; the flesh on his left leg above the knee had been torn away. He did not speak. Only the movement of his eyes revealed that he was still alive. CNN cannot verify the authenticity of the video. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said two children were among four civilians killed by an ""armed terrorist group"" firing mortar shells in Aleppo. The government also said it ""inflicted heavy losses"" when its soldiers confronted ""terrorists"" conducting other attacks. SANA didn't provide a death toll. The regime has consistently described opposition fighters as terrorists. Elsewhere, 43 people died in Damascus and its suburbs and 19 in Deir Ezzor. Others were killed in Idlib, Daraa, Hama, Homs and Raqqa. U.N. panel on Syria gets thumbs up . The U.N. Human Rights Council voted Friday to extend the mandate of the Commission of Inquiry on Syria, the entity tasked with investigating human rights abuses during the civil war. The vote -- which was held in Geneva, Switzerland -- was overwhelming, with 41 in favor. China, Russia and Cuba opposed the move. India, the Philippines and Uganda abstained. The council asked U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon ""to provide additional resources, including staffing"" to the commission. It also renewed its request for Syrian authorities ""to cooperate fully with the Commission of Inquiry, including by granting it immediate, full and unfettered access throughout Syria."" The council also condemned a May massacre in Houla, near Homs. It said government forces and its militia allies ""were found by the Commission of Inquiry to be the perpetrators of outrageous and heinous crimes."" Laura Dupuy Lasserre, president of the Human Rights Council, announced her two appointments to the commission: Carla del Ponte, the former prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, and Vitit Muntarbhorn, who served the council previously as a special rapporteur. Background . The Syrian conflict broke out in March 2011 after unarmed protesters, inspired by the success of popular uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia, took to the streets demanding political reform and an end to four decades of rule by the Assad family. The movement devolved into an armed conflict after a brutal and continuing crackdown by regime forces. Since the unrest began, more than 30,000 people have been killed, the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.

"In our Behind the Scenes series, CNN correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events. CNN's Chris Lawrence uncovers the challenges facing high school students in Los Angeles, as part of the weeklong ""Broken Schools"" series airing this week on CNN's American Morning, weekdays at 6 a.m. ET . At L.A.'s Jefferson High School nearly 75 percent of the parents of students did not finish high school. LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- It's the first week of their freshman year and four girls are gossiping outside of Jefferson High School as they wait for the bell to head inside. If the numbers stay true, only one or two of them will graduate from high school. One of the girls, Ana Rosa Gutierrez, already says she doesn't like school. She calls it boring and says, ""School doesn't give you money. You have to go ... drop out to go work and get money to support your family."" Ana Rosa is 13 years old. I ask her if she's known anyone who left school. But I should have asked her if she's known anyone who stayed. ""Most of my brother's friends dropped out. My brother dropped out because we needed money, he got a job,"" says Ana Rosa. ""How old was he,"" I ask. ""I think, 16,"" she replies. We listen to teachers take attendance during first period and look at all the empty seats in the classroom. ""Louis Romero? Louis? He's absent,"" the teacher remarks. That's not unusual at Jefferson High School, where 58 percent of students, nearly six out of 10 students, drop out.  See why the school's dropout rate is so high » . ""I'm not proud of having the highest dropout rate in the system,"" says Principal Juan Flecha. But there are many factors beyond his control. The families are for the most part poor. Many are held together by single mothers who don't have much money. So there's pressure in homes like Ana Rosa's for teens to get a job and help the family. But it's much deeper than that. The school is located in an area of Los Angeles where new immigrants settle, mostly from Mexico and Central America. About half of the students are learning English as a second language and it's not often reinforced at home. Jefferson has extended the school day to increase time spent on language arts, but Superintendent David Brewer asks, ""How do you teach a child to not only learn a language, but master the language to the extent they can learn algebra? And learn Shakespeare?"" Nearly 75 percent of the parents of Jefferson High students did not graduate from high school. So there's no history of education to draw from. Still, the school is trying to hold parents accountable by working with the city attorney's ""Operation Bright Future,"" a school truancy and gang prevention program. ""If their students are absent a lot, then the city attorney goes to the parents and says 'Listen if you don't get your kids in school then you could be in jail,' "" says Brewer. You can't separate the school from its neighborhood. Jefferson had to be locked down on the first day of school after there was a shooting just a half-block away. Students like Ana Rosa have to adopt an almost military mind-set just to get here, devising strategic routes through gang territory. ""One of the sad things is ... there are certain blocks where they know that it's just not safe to go through there,"" says Flecha. ""And, they have to establish a very elaborate pathway from home to school."" There are signs of hope. In 2005, only half of the seniors passed the graduation exam. Last year, nearly three out of four students passed. Jefferson has beefed up security inside the school and has created a program that allows students choose their own track: teacher preparation, global leadership, business or creative arts. So-called ""dropout advisors"" have increased home visits to students who have stopped coming to class. Jefferson recently qualified for nearly $2 million in state funds and it plans to hire 10 new teachers and a psychiatric social worker. But will it be enough to keep students like Ana Rosa, who doesn't see school as anything that can make her life better? As she walks through the front door of Jefferson, I ask her if she thinks she'll stay. ""Hopefully. Hopefully, I will. I don't know,"" she responds. ""But you're not sure,"" I prod. ""I'm not sure,"" she says.","Nearly 58 percent, or 6 out of 10, Jefferson High School students will drop out .

"(CNN) -- Country music icon George Strait has announced his final concert go-round but stressed that he does not plan to ride into the sunset after his two-year ""The Cowboy Rides Away Tour"" ends in 2014. ""Don't think I'm retiring, because I'm not,"" Strait, who turned 60 this year, said at a press conference Wednesday at the Country Music and Museum in Nashville, Tennessee. ""If a special event happens to come up somewhere I want to do, by all means, I'm going to do it,"" he said. ""I hope I still have a lot of those left in me."" A likely prospect, if his future at all resembles his past. Strait lays claim to 59 number one hits -- at least one a year for 30 years - and 65 million albums sales, according to the news release announcing his final tour. Straight broke into stardom with his 1981 album ""Strait Country"" and has cranked out an album almost every year since -- in some years two, according to his discography on allmusic.com. To say the country star has been wildly popular would be an understatement: With 13 multi-platinum, 33 platinum and 38 gold records, according to the Recording Industry Association of America, only the biggest names in popular music, the likes of The Beatles and Elvis have outdone him in album sales in the United States. In recorded music, Strait, with his smooth Texas accent and traditional county style, has even outsold The Rolling Stones stateside, who RIAA lists with 11 multi-platinum, 28 platinum and 42 gold albums. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2006, a rarity for a still actively recording artist. The music icon was no stranger to 1960's musical phenomenon known as the British Invasion, which brought The Beatles and The Stones to America, according to Strait's hall of fame biography. Growing up in a small town south of San Antonio, Texas, it was the music he listened to. In an almost clichÃ©d country music scenario, Strait's mother took her daughter and left Strait and his brother ""Buddy"" with their father, a math teacher, to raise, according to the singer's biography on allmusic. Strait was a sod buster but also a rock musician. He helped work the family's 2,000-acre ranch and joined garage bands in high school, the hall of fame wrote. After eloping with his high-school sweetheart, he enlisted in the army, where he became a country singer in a band on his base in Hawaii. He stuck with it when he arrived back home, and while playing with country band ""Ace in the Hole,"" promoter Erv Woolsey, who later became Strait's manager, discovered him and got him a recording contract with MCA. Over 30 years later, the first year of his final tour will kick off and wrap up in his home state of Texas. ""We start out in Lubbock and are going to go up there and play for a bunch of Red Raiders,"" Strait said. ""That's always fun."" A list of the 21 venues for 2013 can be found on the singer's Facebook page. Popular female country artist Martina McBride joins him as guest artist for the first year of the tour. The tour is named after one of Strait's many hits, The Cowboy Rides Away, a sad melody about a woman breaking a man's heart. ""It's a song that we've closed our show with for many years,"" Strait said, who also shared a memory of playing it for President George Bush, Sr. at Camp David, a week before he left office. Strait felt it was important to quit while he's ahead and not to wait for the public to end the relationship some day, leaving him crooning before dwindling audiences. He also has no intention of preserving himself as a Las Vegas casino act. ""I don't feel like I'll ever want to do that,"" he said. When the stress of touring has evaporated two years down the road, Strait said he plans to spend more time playing golf and angling with a special partner. ""I have a new grandson, so I will certainly be spending a lot of time with him,"" Stait said. ""I'll try to steal him away from his parents for a while and maybe take him fishing."" But he couldn't stop repeating that he is not through with music and even announced he will be recording a new album soon. ""I think it's been the longest time right now between records for me ever since '81, so I'm pretty anxious to get something out."" He even left a back door open -- well, maybe just cracked -- on the possibility of touring again in the coming years. ""In 2016 I might say 'what a dummy,' "" Strait quipped, drawing warm snickers from the audience, ""and if that's the case, maybe I'll reconsider, but at this particular time, I'm pretty sure I won't."" It seems that for the cowboy, as his tour theme song says: . ""Oh the last goodbye's the hardest one to say,"" And this is where the cowboy rides away."" Or not.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- A Metrolink engineer driving a commuter train sent a text message about 22 seconds before the train collided with a Union Pacific freight train last month, the National Transportation Safety Board said Wednesday. The crash killed 25 people, including the engineer, Robert Sanchez, during Friday rush hour in Chatsworth, a northwest Los Angeles suburb. Meanwhile, the Senate on Wednesday night cleared a rail safety reform bill that would give Amtrak $13 billion dollars over five years, its passage partly pushed by the September 12 collision, according to The Associated Press. The bill, which passed by a 74-24 vote, will go before President Bush who has not said if he'll sign it. The Federal Railroad Administration told the AP that safety technology mandated by the legislation would have prevented the crash. The bill adds 200 new safety inspectors and requires technology be installed by 2015 that can slow a train that runs a red light or jumps off track. The NTSB earlier determined the brakes on the Metrolink train were not applied before the collision and that stop signals at the scene were working properly, said Kitty Higgins, an NTSB member assigned to the investigation. The bill also limits the hours a week rail crews can work, and prohibits shifts longer than 12 hours, the AP said. On Wednesday, the NTSB said that Sanchez, 46, sent a text message at 4:22:01 p.m. on September 12, the NTSB said, citing information on his cell phone activity that the safety board subpoenaed from his service provider. The preliminary estimate of the time for the head-on collision is 4:22:23 p.m., NTSB said, citing Union Pacific train's onboard recorders. Sanchez last received a text message at 4:21:03 p.m., NTSB said. From 3:03 p.m. -- when Sanchez returned from a break that had lasted several hours -- until the collision, the engineer received seven text message and sent five, the NTSB said. The safety board did not identify with whom Sanchez was exchanging text messages. From 6:44 a.m. until 8:53 a.m. that day, when Sanchez was also in charge of a train, he received 21 text messages and sent two dozen, the NTSB said. ""The Safety Board's Recorder Laboratory is continuing to correlate times recorded for use of the Metrolink engineer's cell phone, train recorder data, and signal system data to a common time base,"" NTSB said. After the incident, California Public Utilities Commission banned train operators from texting on the job. In pushing for the ban, Commission President Michael Peevey said cell phone use by engineers ""may have been a factor"" in train accidents this year in San Francisco and Sacramento, California. He did not elaborate on details of those incidents. Thursday's order is temporary until the state commission decides whether to make it permanent. Metrolink prohibits cell phone use by engineers on the job, but Peevey emphasized there is no federal or California regulation barring cell phone use by engineers while trains are moving. Twenty-four bodies were found at the scene after the collision. A 25th victim, a man in his 50s, died at a hospital. More than 130 people were injured. The agency said it also has been in contact with two teenagers who told a local television station they were exchanging text messages with the engineer just before the crash. Higgins said investigators interviewed a Metrolink train conductor who had worked with Sanchez since April. The conductor ""had no issues of his time working with the engineer and on how the engineer operated the train,"" she said.","NEW: AP: Senate passes bill to give billions to Amtrak .

"(Rolling Stone) -- For the first time since the Rolling Stones formed nearly 50 years ago, Mick Jagger is part of a new band: Super Heavy -- featuring Dave Stewart, Joss Stone, Damian Marley and Indian film composer A.R. Rahman. The band has quietly been recording together over the past 18 months, with their debut LP planned for sometime around September. ""It's different from anything else I've ever been involved in,"" Jagger tells Rolling Stone. ""The music is very wide-ranging -- from reggae to ballads to Indian songs in Urdu."" Choose Rolling Stone's Cover: The Sheepdogs vs. Lelia Broussard. Vote Now! The group got its start two years ago when Dave Stewart called Jagger from his home in Jamaica. ""I live in Lime Hall right above St. Ann's Bay,"" says Stewart. ""It's kind of the jungle, and sometimes I'd hear three sound systems all playing different things. I always love that, along with Indian orchestras. I said to Mick, 'How could we make a fusion?' We were talking about an experiment, and then we started talking about voices. It was all born from that conversation."" Jagger loved the idea, and after lots of brainstorming and phone calls around the world, they settled on Stone, A.R. Rahman and Marley - whose rhythm section helped flesh out the band. ""We wanted a convergence of different musical styles,"" says Jagger. ""We were always overlapping styles, but they were nevertheless separate."" About 18 months ago, the band gathered in a Los Angeles studio. None of them had prepared any music. ""We didn't know what the hell we were doing,"" says Stewart. ""We were just jamming and making a noise. It was like when a band first starts up in your garage. Sometimes Damien would kick it off and then Joss would sing something on top of it. We might have a 22 minute jam, and it would become a six minute song."" Photos: Rare and Intimate Pictures of the Rolling Stones . The loose method was inspiring for Jagger. ""One of the beauties is that, just speaking as a vocalist, I did other things,"" Jagger says. ""I played guitar and harmonica, but there's four vocalist on the album. Not everything was reliant on me."" The band's name came from some improvised vocals by Marley. ""He was just singing 'Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, super heavy,'"" says Stewart. ""We thought that sounded good and it sort of stuck with us."" Jagger is confident that Stones fans will embrace the group. ""It is a different kind of record that what people would expect,"" he says. ""It's not all weird and strange though. I think Stones fans will think it's a bit odd, but they'll find most of it accessible. They've heard me play harmonica before and a lot of it is pretty high energy."" Photo Gallery: The Rolling Stones Live, 1964-2007 . As of now, there are no plans to bring Super Heavy on the road. ""We're experimenting at the moment and just taking it day by day,"" says Stewart. ""I think if we're rehearsing and it sounds great and people love the idea then nobody would rule out the possibility of it."" Might Jagger's other group be hitting the road at some point in the future? In an interview with USA Today, Keith Richards said he was optimistic. ""Something's blowing in the wind,"" he said. ""The idea's there. We kind of know we should do it, but nobody's put their finger on the moment yet. This is what we want to ask each other: Do we want to go out in a blaze of glory? We can, if Mick and Charlie feel like I do, that we can still turn people on. We don't have to prove nothing anymore. I just love playing, and I miss the crowd."" When asked if the Stones are going to tour next year, Jagger just chuckles. ""I don't have any announcement to make at the moment,"" he says. ""I'm just, uh, ya know...just doing this right now.""

"(CNN) -- U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said Sunday that American forces can ""deal with any potential contingencies"" in the Middle East, especially after the military's capabilities were recently ""enhanced"" after attacks on U.S. diplomatic missions. Speaking to reporters en route to Tokyo, Panetta said recent unrest underscores the importance of having vibrant, flexible U.S. military capabilities in the region. That unrest includes an attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans, as well as violent protests near U.S. embassies in Egypt, Yemen, Tunisia and elsewhere. ""The events of this week remind all of us of the need to maintain a strong presence in the Middle East,"" Panetta said. More arrests in U.S. Consulate attack in Libya . Some of that comes from U.S. forces' extensive roots in the region, including bases in Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar and elsewhere. Those troops make it easier to respond to crises in the region, which Panetta acknowledged, as do other recent moves, which include calling on members of small Marine Fleet Antiterrorism Security Teams, or FAST, teams and moving warships in the region. ""We have enhanced some of that presence with the FAST teams and others so that, if they are requested, they can respond more quickly,"" Panetta said. ""It's a combination of FAST teams plus some ships in the region that we have to try to give us the full capability we need in order to respond,"" he added, while noting the didn't ""anticipate a situation right now where we would have to ... do this on our own."" Earlier this week, vigorous and sometimes violent protests broke out near U.S. embassies around the world over the ""Innocence of Muslims,"" an obscure film mocking the Prophet Mohammed as a womanizer, child molester and ruthless killer. Two months after the film's trailer was posted online on YouTube, and days after it got attention in Egyptian media, Cairo residents first expressed their ire Tuesday, the 11th anniversary of the September 11, 2001, attacks, with protests targeting the American embassy. Outpourings soon spread like wildfire across the Muslim world. As a result, Western diplomats found themselves and their missions under siege, even as American leaders criticized the film and emphasized the U.S. government had nothing to do with it. Afterward, U.S. officials said Marine FAST teams, with about 50 members each, were being dispatched to Libya, Sudan and Yemen to protect U.S. diplomatic missions in those countries. But Sudanese officials rebuffed the U.S. plan to send in troops, insisting their own security forces could protect the U.S. Embassy in Khartoum. And Yemen's parliament issued a statement early Sunday vehemently opposing the presence of U.S. troops in the country. One nation that hasn't voiced opposition to a small contingent of U.S. troops is Libya. Libyan officials have said they are cooperating closely with U.S. authorities in investigating Tuesday's attack in Benghazi, which they have strongly condemned. ""I'm convinced that they want to do everything possible to be able to respond to what happened there,"" Panetta said of Libyan officials. ""And I think they are taking steps on the security side to provide better security. ... I think they are making a strong effort to try to respond to this crisis and try to deal with the issues involved.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- First, there was ""Einstein,"" the federal government's effort to protect itself from cyber attacks by limiting the number of portals to government computer systems and searching for signs of cyber tampering. Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff wants better protection for government computer systems. Then Einstein 2.0, a system now being tested to detect computer intrusions as they happen. And in the future? Perhaps Einstein 3.0, which would give the government the ability to fight back. Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff on Friday said he'd like to see a government computer infrastructure that could look for early indications of computer skullduggery and stop it before it happens. The system ""would literally, like an anti-aircraft weapon, shoot down an attack before it hits its target,"" he said. ""And that's what we call Einstein 3.0."" At a meeting with reporters to highlight National Cyber Security Month, Chertoff reiterated his belief that the government should aggressively defend its computer systems, saying that terrorists, if they gain expertise already available to others, would ""cause potentially very serious havoc"" to government systems. ""Let's make the investment now rather than wait until there's a huge catastrophe,"" he said. But despite his emphasis on the risks posed, Chertoff said the government is moving slowly to avoid stepping on the toes of the private sector as it addresses calls to reorganize the governance of cyberspace to provide accountability and authority. ""I think the question of what is the government's role in cyberspace in general needs to be discussed among all the stakeholders, because there is a culture of cyberspace that is an open architecture,"" he said. ""And I think if we just came in and said we want to take it over, there'd be, understandably, a considerable amount of discomfort with that."" ""We are deliberately going slowly because we recognize that the issue of government involvement in the Internet is fraught with all kinds of potential concerns and potential anxieties about not having the government have a big-foot impact on an area of communication and commerce that has traditionally been viewed as really independent and free."" Chertoff said the government is ""feeling our way to what is the right mix of government involvement with protecting the Internet in the private domain while preserving everybody's comfort level that we're not going to be in their business in a way that would be inappropriate."" Asked if he envisioned a world with two cyberspaces, he said he envisions a world with ""a lot of different levels of security and trust, depending upon the nature of what it is that you're doing."" ""We already have that now, in the sense that we have classified systems which are walled off from unclassified systems,"" he said. The Bush administration released its National Cyber Security Initiative in January. The ""most immediate component"" of it from the Department of Homeland Security's perspective, Chertoff said, is to increase security for federal government computer systems. But another priority is to work with the private sector to address threats to businesses. This includes not only protection from hackers, but also from counterfeit parts, which an individual or another nation could use to create vulnerabilities in the United States, he said.","Einstein 3.0 would ""shoot down"" attempts to tamper with government computers .

"Washington (CNN) -- While the presidential election has topped the news much of the year, it has been pushed aside by Sandy as the storm crashed into the East Coast. Both President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, their running mates, and backers have pretty much curtailed campaigning, some fundraising and advertising as they wait to see the severity of damage from the storm. Sandy overshadows candidates on Facebook . Here are five things to watch for in the storm and its aftermath: . 1. Playing the commander-in-chief card . President Barack Obama canceled his appearance at a campaign event in Florida on Monday to return to Washington to monitor the federal government's preparation and emergency response for the hurricane. Soon after his arrival back at the White House, the president spoke to reporters in the briefing room. Asked how the storm would impact next week's election, Obama said, ""I am not worried, at this point about the impact on the election. I'm worried about the impact on families and I'm worried about the impact on our first responders. I'm worried about the impact on our economy and on transportation. The election will take care of itself next week."" Looking presidential: The optics of leadership during a disaster . Before leaving for the abbreviated campaign visit to Florida a day earlier, Obama stopped by the Federal Emergency Management Agency for an update on preparations for the coming storm and told reporters that, ""it's so important for us to respond big and respond fast as local information starts coming in."" Call it the power of incumbency. ""The beauty of being a president and a candidate is that when a monster storm stalks up the East Coast, you can run over to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and be seen as a president on the job, which also works if you are re-applying,"" said CNN Chief Political Correspondent Candy Crowley, host of CNN's ""State of the Union."" Crowley: Sandy introduces big unknown into campaign . But there can also be a downside for the president: If the federal government's response to storm damage is deemed slow and inefficient (remember Hurricane Katrina?), Obama may pay a political price just days before the election. Zelizer: How Sandy will test Obama, Romney . President George W. Bush's approval rating never recovered from Katrina, and that was a contributing factor in his party's defeat at the polls 15 months later in the 2006 mid-term elections. 2. Romney low profile, but for how long? About three hours after the president canceled his appearance at a campaign rally in Florida and hopped on Air Force One to Washington, the Romney campaign announced that the Republican nominee would cancel his event Monday night in Wisconsin. The campaign also announced that Romney's running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, would cancel events Monday in Melbourne and Lakeland, Florida, and both candidates' events for Tuesday were also being scrapped. ""Out of sensitivity for the millions of Americans in the path of Hurricane Sandy, we are canceling tonight's events with Governor Romney in Wisconsin and Congressman Ryan in Melbourne and Lakeland, Florida,"" Romney Communications Director Gail Gitcho said in a statement to reporters just before noon ET on Monday. And on the campaign trail Sunday and Monday before he suspended campaigning, Romney continuously mentioned those in harm's way of Sandy. ""On the eastern coast of our nation, a lot of people are enduring some very difficult times, and our hearts and our prayers go to them as we think about how tough it's going to be there,"" Romney said at a rally in Avon Lake, Ohio. ""So I'd like to ask you who are here today to think about making a contribution to the Red Cross or to another relief agency, to be of help if you possibly can in any way you can imagine to help those who're in harm's way."" The optics are easy to understand. Campaigning does not look good while millions of East Coast residents are getting pounded by what may end up being a very devastating storm. ""Just the forecast of a potential disaster can make politics look small,"" Crowley added. Both campaigns stopped sending fundraising emails to supporters in the states affected by the storm, and the Romney campaign announced that in North Carolina, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Virginia, it was collecting supplies at its campaign offices to help local storm relief efforts. In Virginia, the campaign was loading storm-relief supplies onto the Romney bus to be delivered. Romney campaign aids Sandy relief effort . While he can't compete with a sitting president leading the federal government's storm response, Romney did reschedule a campaign rally in Dayton, Ohio Tuesday and is transforming it into a disaster relief event. 3. Knocking the final campaign ad assault off the air . It's as simple as this: If the storm knocks out your power, you can't watch TV. Both campaigns are planning to spend tens of millions of dollars on a final assault of campaign commercials. But Sandy could knock those plans off the air in such battleground states as Virginia, New Hampshire, North Carolina, and the lean Obama-state of Pennsylvania, which are all in the storm's path. And while it won't get a direct hit, battleground Ohio will also feel the wrath of Sandy. Do the math: The CNN Electoral Map . ""In areas without power and thus without either TV advertising or TV news, the race is likely to be frozen in place,"" said Elizabeth Wilner, vice president at Kantar Media/Campaign Media Analysis Group, which tracks political ad spending on broadcast and national cable TV. But she said it was rare for an entire media market to be without power, so advertising would continue in those markets with both campaigns hoping for a restoration of service as soon as possible. Wilner adds that the campaigns may be forced to go heavier on the ground, or do more radio or print ads, in order to reach areas that remain without power well into the week. By the numbers: Swing states . 4. Will the storm stifle early voting? The answer is yes, but not in states that are in play. Maryland and the District of Columbia suspended early voting Monday because of Sandy. But the president is expected to easily carry both. The storm did impact some early voting in some of the eastern portions of the swing state of North Carolina, and could put a damper on some early voting in northern and eastern Ohio. And in the battleground state of Virginia, which allows limited absentee voting in advance of Election Day, some counties Monday canceled such in-person absentee voting. If the storm does put a dent in early voting, the Obama campaign would feel the bigger impact, as it seems to rely more on pre-election day voting than the Romney campaign. By the numbers: Early voting . ""Obviously we want unfettered access to the polls because we believe that the more people come out, the better we're going to do, and so to the extent that it makes it harder, you know, that's a source of concern,"" Obama campaign senior adviser David Axelrod said on ""State of the Union."" 5. Pulling the plug on polling . With just a week to go until Election Day, expect a flood of final polling. Or maybe not. The storm is washing out some polling organizations' plans. Both Gallup and Investors Business Daily/TIPP announced Monday that they were temporarily suspending their daily national tracking polls. And in some of the states directly impacted by the storm, polling may become much more difficult, as Sandy knocks out phone lines and some cell service. Colorado poll: Romney 48% -- Obama 47% .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Newly released documents show that military personnel watching over at least two American citizens held in U.S. Navy brigs feared that the isolation and austere conditions were threatening detainees' sanity. Records show that military personnel feared for the sanity of detainees in U.S. Navy brigs. Documents obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request quote an unnamed brig official writing about detainee Yaser Hamdi in June 2002. ""I will continue to do what I can to help this individual maintain his sanity, but in my opinion, we're working with borrowed time,"" he wrote. The recipient of the e-mail also is unidentified. The communication is one of several in which brig personnel expressed worries to superiors about the mental state of Hamdi, a dual Saudi/U.S. citizen who was captured on the battlefield in Afghanistan in 2001. Another e-mail about Hamdi written six months later, in December 2002, shows an unidentified military person appealing to higher-ups to be able to provide Hamdi with games and tapes to help him pass the time during confinement as a means to steady his mental state. ""I would like to have some form of an incentive program in place to reward him for his continued good behavior, but more so, to keep him from whacking [sic] out on me."" A June 2003 e-mail reports that Hamdi ""feels as if he has been forgotten."" ""The last thing I wanted to have happen was to send him anywhere from here as a 'Basket Case,' of use to no one,"" the author of the message wrote. ""I fear the rubber band is nearing its breaking point here and not totally confident I can keep his head in the game much longer."" The Pentagon would not discuss the specifics of the newly released documents. But a spokesman, Navy Cmdr. Jeff Gordon, issued a brief statement: ""The Department of Defense policy is clear: We treat all detainees humanely. The United States operates safe, humane and professional detention operations for unlawful enemy combatants at war with this country."" After his capture in 2001, Hamdi was sent to the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Once officials discovered that he was born in the United States, he was transferred to the United States and held in solitary confinement in Naval brigs in Norfolk, Virginia, and then in Charleston, South Carolina. Hamdi was never charged with breaking any laws, and the Supreme Court ruled in 2004 that the United States could not hold him indefinitely without bringing charges. Hamdi was allowed to return to Saudi Arabia, and he relinquished his U.S. citizenship. The e-mails reveal that brig personnel had been instructed to treat Hamdi and later two other enemy combatants held in the United States in a manner similar to hundreds of prisoners detained by the military at  Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Attorneys for a second detainee, Jose Padilla, filed a Freedom of Information Act request to obtain the documents about the treatment of the detainees at the military brigs. Yale Law School's Lowenstein International Human Rights Clinic and the American Civil Liberties Union obtained the 91 pages of material, which the ACLU released to the public. Jonathan Freiman, one of the Padilla attorneys, said the government's own documents provide damaging information about how his client and the other enemy combatants were treated in U.S. facilities. ""He was treated abysmally and unconstitutionally for years,"" he said. ""It's a clear violation of the Fifth Amendment,"" which guarantees the right to due process. Another Padilla lawyer, Tahlia Townsend, said the documents show that military staff at the brig were told to keep Padilla and the others ""in conditions to soften them up for interrogation."" The lawyers are concerned that they have yet to receive documents about Padilla's treatment from 2002 to 2004, which they contend could provide more evidence about how he was treated. Most of the material just released concerns Hamdi. The ACLU issued a statement saying brig officials ""doubted the wisdom of applying Guantanamo rules on American soil"" but had to follow orders from the Pentagon. The United States eventually brought charges against Padilla, and he was convicted in 2007 of providing material support for terrorism in Bosnia, Kosovo and Chechnya. A third detainee remains in custody at the brig in Charleston, South Carolina. Ali al-Marri is a native of Qatar and was a legal U.S. resident when he was arrested in Illinois in 2001. Al-Marri was transferred from civilian to military custody in 2003. U.S. officials suspected that al-Marri was a member of an al Qaeda sleeper cell, but no terrorism charges were filed against him. Jonathan Hafetz, a lawyer for al-Marri, is appealing his client's detention to the Supreme Court. Hafetz also works for the ACLU. When CNN asked for his reaction to the e-mails, Hafetz replied, ""I was surprised you saw the concern and discomfort so early on by military officials"" at the brigs. Hafetz said those at the brig seemed sympathetic to the plight of the enemy combatants in their care but were forced to follow orders. The new documents also contain e-mails about his client. One from April 2007 talks about how al-Marri had not been able to communicate with his wife and five children, who had gone back to Saudi Arabia to live. ""I believe that it is in Mr. al-Marri's and our best interest for him to be able to communicate in some way with his family,"" said the unidentified brig official. ""Five years is too long."" Hafetz said that conditions began to improve a bit for his client after he filed suit in 2005 but that he still doesn't have contact with other detainees at the brig. ""The fundamental problem remains: He's in virtual isolation. More than 1,800 days in isolation."" ""His mental state has been deteriorating,"" Hafetz said. ""You're alone with no idea when confinement will end."" Hafetz said al-Marri is now allowed two phone calls a year with his family. He can get mail, but the lawyer said it takes two to four months to get to his client, because everything is sent first to the military facility in Guantanamo Bay, where it must be cleared.","Records: Official said detainee Yaser Hamdi's sanity was faltering .

"(CNN) -- Friends and family identified the 20-year-old Frederick, Maryland, man who died after police used a Taser stun gun on him Sunday morning, according to a local television station. Jarrel Gray, 20, died after police used a Taser gun on him Sunday morning, family and friends say. The man, who friends and family identified as Jarrel Gray, was involved in a fight at an apartment complex about 5 a.m. Sunday, police said. Authorities have not released Gray's name. ""I haven't heard anything except that he's gone,"" Troy Thomas told WJLA-TV. Thomas, who said he was Gray's uncle, told the television station, ""I lost my best friend."" Cassandra Rollings, a friend of the family, appeared at the apartment complex where Gray died, holding a large photo of the young man wearing a tie. Gray was a ""very good kid,"" Rollings said. Deputies responded Sunday morning to a report of a fight at an apartment complex and found four people in a scuffle, Cpl. Jennifer Bailey of the Frederick County Sheriff's Office said Sunday. Eric Cargenas, a man who lives in the apartment complex and said he saw the fight, told WJLA that two people started fighting after a yelling match. A deputy used a Taser on Gray, who fell unconscious, Bailey said. He was taken to Frederick Memorial Hospital where he was pronounced dead. His body was taken to the medical examiner's office in Baltimore for an autopsy. The results of some tests could take several weeks, according to an office spokeswoman. Baltimore is about 50 miles east of Frederick. The sheriff's office has not publicly identified the deputy who allegedly used the Taser, but Bailey said the deputy was placed on administrative leave with pay while authorities investigate the incident. Since June 2001, more than 150 people have died in the United States after being subdued with stun guns, according to Amnesty International, which has called for police departments to suspend use of the devices pending study of their possible risks. More than 7,000 of the nation's 18,000 law enforcement agencies use the devices, Amnesty says. Recent deaths involving Taser devices have received much publicity. Last month, a police officer at Vancouver International Airport in British Columbia, Canada, used a Taser gun on a 40-year-old man making his first airplane trip outside Poland. He died. In a statement released Friday, Taser International cited the Vancouver case and said it ""appears to follow the pattern of many in-custody deaths or deaths following a confrontation with police. Historically, medical science and forensic analysis has shown that these deaths are attributable to other factors and not the low-energy electrical discharge of the Taser."" A bystander's video of the October 14 incident in Vancouver shows the victim continuing to struggle after being shot with the device. Taser International said on its Web site that the struggle ""is proof that the Taser device was not the cause of his death."" Cardiac arrest caused by electrical current would have caused immediate death, the company said. ""We are taken aback by the number of media outlets that have irresponsibly published conclusive headlines blaming the Taser device and/or the law enforcement officers involved as the cause of death before completion of the investigation,"" said Tom Smith, the company's founder and chairman of the board. But Amnesty International, noting that coroners have determined Tasers were a contributing factor in more than 30 deaths, said such a link cannot be ruled out. The devices use compressed nitrogen to shoot two probes -- connected to the device by wire -- up to 35 feet at speeds exceeding 100 mph. An electrical signal transmitted through the wires contacts the body or clothing, ""resulting in an immediate loss of the person's neuromuscular control and the ability to perform coordinated action for the duration of the impulse,"" according to the company.

"(CNN) -- Eintracht Frankfurt's fairy tale return to the Bundesliga has had the old romantics yearning for yesteryear. Once a feared and respected name in German and European football, the club has been in the shadow ever since it reached the European Cup final some 52 years ago. Back in the big time, Frankfurt has made a blistering start to its season, winning its first four games before being held to a 3-3 tie by champion Borussia Dortmund. Promotion last season promised a bright future for the club and recent weeks have not disappointed. Just two defeats from its first nine games had fans dreaming of the old days when their side was a force in European football. Champions Dortmund held as Eintracht Frankfurt set early Bundesliga pace . In 1959, Eintracht won its one and only Bundesliga title and went on to reach the European Cup final the following year. Just a mention of the 1960 European Cup final will have the older supporters recollecting memories of how Real Madrid, inspired by Alfredo di Stefano and Ferenc Puskas, put the Germans to the sword that night. Puskas, arguably one of the greatest players of his generation, scored four times, while di Stefano netted a hat-trick as Real ran out 7-3 winners in one of the finest football matches in the competition's history. While the two clubs may have reached the pinnacle on that night in Glasgow, they soon took very different paths as Real continued to conquer, while Frankfurt began to fade. While Frankfurt did reach the 1980 UEFA Cup, where it lost out to German rivals Borussia Monchengladbach, success has eluded the club in recent history. The club has struggled to compete with the giants of Bayern Munich, Dortmund and Schalke, instead spending its time moving between the top two divisions. Not since 2006 has the club appeared in Europe, where it competed in the now defunct UEFA Cup following its appearance in the German Cup final. Bayern set new record as Dortmund slip up against Schalke . While manager Armin Veh has performed miracles, there have been signs that life at the top is beginning to catch up with Frankfurt. Last weekend's defeat by Stuttgart, its second of the campaign, brought the players back down to earth. Its home game against Greuther Fürth, a team sitting bottom of the Bundesliga at the start of the weekend, was supposed to provide the opportunity to get back on track . Frankfurt made the perfect start when Alex Meier scored with an 18-yard drive after just 20 seconds to claim his fifth goal in as many games. But while many expected Greuther Fürth to capitulate, it was quite the opposite as Frankfurt were forced on to the back foot for much of the contest. Fürth, who was promoted from the second division alongside Frankfurt last year, has struggled so far this term. But it refused to give up the fight and Zoltan Stieber fired home a 53rd minute equalizer to claim a point a lift the club off the bottom of the table. Bayern unbeaten run in Bundesliga halted by Bayer Leverkusen . The result means Frankfurt has 20 points from its ten games so far this season and sits in third ahead of the rest of this weekend's games. And what next for Veh's side? Well, that would be the small question of a trip to the Allianz Arena to face Bayern Munich side which reached last season's Champions League Final and has won eight of its nine league games this season. If Frankfurt was unsure whether it was back in the big time, then next week will certainly provide a healthy dose of reality.","Eintracht Frankfurt held to a 1-1 draw by Greuther Fürth .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- An Ohio death row inmate was executed Tuesday after the Supreme Court rejected his last-minute plea that he was too overweight to be put to death. Richard Cooey, 41, and an accomplice were convicted of the 1986 murders of two college students. Richard Cooey was pronounced dead at 10:28 a.m. ET, said Andrea Carson, spokeswoman for the Ohio Department of Corrections. The execution went as scheduled, she said, with ""no problems whatsoever."" Cooey had exhausted his legal appeals and Gov. Ted Strickland earlier denied the 41-year-old prisoner's clemency petition. Cooey murdered two college students in 1986. Asked if he had any final words, Carson quoted Cooey as saying, ""You haven't paid attention to anything I've had to say for the past 22 years, so why would you think that I would think you're going to pay attention to what I have to say now?"" Earlier Tuesday, the Supreme Court rejected the stay Cooey's attorneys had sought, along with the opportunity to address the larger constitutional claims over when a convicted person is medically unfit for capital punishment. The court was also asked to review whether Ohio's lethal injection procedures amount to cruel and unusual punishment. Cooey's lawyers maintained that at 5-foot-7 and 267 pounds, he was ""morbidly obese"" and had gained about 70 pounds since he was imprisoned at age 19. Prison food and confinement in his cell for 23 hours a day, limiting his opportunities for exercise, contributed to his weight problem, his legal team argued. Cooey also contended regular medication he took for migraines would weaken the effectiveness of an anesthetic used in the three-drug cocktail administered during execution. He said his veins were weakened because of his health issues, and the lethal drugs would constitute cruel and unusual punishment. A federal appeals court ruled Thursday that Cooey waited too long raise the medical issues, saying he ""knew of and could have filed suit over vein access prior to July 2005."" Ohio does not serve a ""last meal,"" as death-row inmates are given the opportunity to eat breakfast before a scheduled execution, Carson told CNN. But on Monday night, she said, Cooey ate a ""special meal"" consisting of a T-bone steak, hash browns, french fries, four eggs over easy, onion rings, four pieces of toast, a pint of Rocky Road ice cream, Mountain Dew and bear claw pastries. He did not eat breakfast Tuesday, Carson said. Cooey and a then-17-year-old accomplice were convicted of the brutal murders of Wendy Offredo and Dawn McCreery, students at the University of Akron. The men had been tossing concrete slabs onto Interstate 77, and one of them struck Offredo's car. Pretending to ""rescue"" the women, Cooey and Clinton Dickens took the victims to a remote field, according to prosecutors. There the students were subjected to a three-and-a-half-hour period of rape, torture, stabbings and fatal bludgeonings. Cooey carved an ""X"" into the stomachs of both women, prosecutors said. Each man blamed the other for delivering the fatal blows, but both were convicted of murder. Dickens received a life sentence because of his age. Cooey tried to escape from death row in 2005, when corrections officials said he constructed a ladder from magazines and bed sheets in an effort to scale the barrier around an outdoor recreation area. At an August clemency hearing, Jon Offredo, brother of one of the victims, said, ""Our family has never gotten an apology from Richard Cooey. We've gotten blatant lies and excuses. Is an apology too much to ask? How could he commit such an heinous act and not feel regret?"" However, Cooey's lawyer, Dana Cole, said his client is sorry for his crimes. The high court has not offered clear guidelines on what medical standards need to be met before an inmate is eligible for death. But in a case five years ago, the justices allowed inmates to at least make a claim that their specific physical or medical issues could be cause to block an execution. The high court had sided with a convicted Alabama killer who claimed his veins were so damaged from years of drug abuse that executioners might have to cut deeply into his flesh to administer the deadly drugs. Writing for the unanimous court in that case, then-Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said the court was not going to ""open the floodgates to all manner of method-of-execution challenges,"" as Alabama feared. ""Our holding is extremely limited."" That inmate is still on death row. Richard Dieter of the Death Penalty Information Center, a data-resource group that opposes capital punishment, said the Supreme Court indicated that ""how you're going to be executed is a civil rights matter, the same as if you were discriminated on the basis of race or gender or something like that."" A Washington state killer was given a reprieve in 1994 after claiming he was too obese to hang. Mitchell Rupe at one time was more than 425 pounds, but weight-loss surgery in prison had reduced that to 275 pounds over the years. Subsequent legal efforts to execute him failed. He died in prison two years ago after a long illness. The Ohio case is Cooey v. Kerns (08-6722). CNN Supreme Court producer Bill Mears contributed to this report.","Richard Cooey executed as scheduled Tuesday morning .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The Peace Corps temporarily has suspended operations in Bolivia because of ""growing instability,"" the organization said. Riot police line up to block the passage of activists Monday in the Bolivian capital of La Paz. All Peace Corps volunteers who were working there have been moved to Peru, the organization said in a Monday statement, explaining that the volunteers will have the opportunity to close out their service or be transferred to another post. ""Our first priority is the safety and security of our volunteers,"" Peace Corps Director Ron Tschetter said in the statement. ""Thousands of Peace Corps Volunteers have served in Bolivia since 1962, building deep friendships with the people there. We hope the situation will improve soon so future volunteers can continue the Peace Corps' fine tradition of valuable service to the Bolivian people."" It was not immediately clear how many Peace Corps volunteers were affected. The organization said its volunteers worked in agriculture, business development, environment, health and youth development. Evo Morales, Bolivia's first Indian president, is battling an autonomy movement in the natural gas-rich eastern departments of Santa Cruz, Pando, Beni and Tarija. The movement was sparked by Morales' pledge to redistribute wealth from the east to the country's poorer highlands. The unrest killed more than 30 people last week in Pando, and Morales declared martial law there Friday.  Watch clashes and protests in Bolivia » .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- John McCain's campaign will stop advertising on several Web sites that have vilified Barack Obama as unpatriotic and, in one case, compared the Democratic nominee-in-waiting to Adolf Hitler. John McCain's campaign says it's getting its ads off Web sites that vilify Barack Obama. A spokesman for McCain said Monday the campaign was not aware its ads were running on the pro-Hillary Clinton sites. He said the campaign has taken steps to block those sites from its online advertising network. ""When we find stuff like this, we take care of it,"" said McCain spokesman Brian Rogers. McCain has made it known he is reaching out to former Clinton supporters, and there are nearly two hundred well-trafficked blogs and online communities run by former Clinton supporters who refuse to support Obama. But the three sites on which McCain's ads appeared are particularly hostile to the Illinois senator. One Web site, called Stop-Obama.org, is a group blog written by disaffected Clinton supporters, some of whom are now supporting McCain. A banner ad featuring McCain standing side-by-side with Joe Lieberman was running on the site until Monday. A recent post on the blog outlined the ""simple parallels"" between Obama and Hitler, and accused Obama's audiences of having the same cult mentality that characterized followers of the German dictator. McCain's ads have also shown up on a pro-Clinton Web site named ""Obama WTF"" that accuses Obama of being ""spineless,"" having ""communist influences,"" ""courting Jew haters"" and being ""in the pocket of America haters."" SavagePolitics.com, another anti-Obama site that has run McCain ads, has called Obama a ""bold faced liar, a thief, a sexist and a racist."" The McCain campaign pulled the ads after being notified by CNN. Rogers said the campaign often has no control over where their ads show up on the Web. That's because the campaign uses a third-party vendor -- in this case, Google -- to distribute their banner ads across a broad array of political Web sites by searching for certain key words. When the campaign is made aware of ads appearing on offensive or irrelevant Web sites, Rogers said, they notify the ad distributor and have the sites added to a list of blocked URLs. He noted the McCain campaign has already blocked ""tens of thousands"" of such sites. It's not the first time Web ads have placed a campaign on the defensive. Mitt Romney's campaign found itself in the politically awkward position of advertising on the Web site Gay.com in late 2007, prompting the Web site to pull the ad shortly after it was discovered. Last September, Barack Obama's campaign removed a campaign advertisement that appeared on the Amazon.com page for the controversial book ""The Israel Lobby,"" which asserts that a network of influential pro-Israel activists hold undue sway over U.S. foreign policy. CNN's Abbi Tatton and Eric Weisbrod contributed to this report.","John McCain campaign ads appeared on Web sites that are strongly anti-Obama .

"Washington (CNN) -- A Secret Service agent suspected of having a romantic relationship with a Mexican woman is dead of an apparent suicide, a law enforcement official told CNN Thursday. The source said Rafael Prieto, 48, was assigned to President Obama's protective detail. The Secret Service confirmed Thursday that Prieto's death last Saturday is currently being investigated by the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, along with the medical examiner's office. No official determination of death has been made. Prieto's access to Secret Service facilities had been suspended while authorities were looking into his apparently unreported and long-term relationship with a foreign national, the law enforcement official said. ""There is nothing to indicate that any classified or sensitive information was compromised as a result of this relationship,"" according to the source. The official said Prieto was involved in an ""administrative process"" about his connection with the woman but that he was not under investigation by the Secret Service's Office of Professional Responsibility. Prieto could have been in violation of Secret Service protocols if he had not informed superiors about a personal relationship with a foreign national. Such relationships came under a spotlight after agents sent to Cartagena, Colombia, in advance of President Obama's trip earlier this year spent time partying with prostitutes. ""Rafael Prieto had a distinguished 20-year career with the Secret Service that was marked by accomplishment, dedication, and friendships,"" said Secret Service spokesman Edwin Donovan.

"(CNN) -- Leaders at the Group of Eight summit in France expressed their support for democracy activists in the Middle East and North Africa on Friday but stopped short of pledging money to support them. The G8 leaders raised the possibility that multilateral development banks could provide more than $20 billion to support reforms in Egypt and Tunisia, where popular uprisings dislodged authoritarian rulers. French President Nicolas Sarkozy said the amount of aid could reach $40 billion. In addition to the possible $20 billion, he cites about $10 billion in bilateral commitments not mentioned in the G8 summit's communique and $10 billion in contributions from Gulf Arab states such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait. ""The changes under way in the Middle East and North Africa are historic and have the potential to open the door to the kind of transformation that occurred in Central and Eastern Europe after the fall of the Berlin Wall,"" the G8 leaders said in a statement.

The United States will host the annual G8 meeting next year. In a statement, the G8 unveiled an initiative called the Deauville Partnership -- named for the city in France where the leaders met. It seeks to address the Arab Spring, the wave of anti-government demonstrations that started in Tunisia and have since roiled several countries in the Middle East and North Africa, including Egypt, Syria, Yemen and Bahrain. The partnership focuses on political reform and economic growth. ""We met with the prime ministers of Egypt and Tunisia, and decided to launch an enduring partnership with those countries engaging in a transition to democracy and tolerant societies,"" the G8 leaders said. ""Our common goal is to develop the rule of law and citizen engagement as well as foster economic and social reforms to meet the aspirations of the people."" Obama ends trip in Poland . The partnership hopes to generate economic transition and integration into the regional and global economy.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- China executed at least 470 people last year -- more than any other country in the world, according to an annual report on the death penalty by the human rights group Amnesty International. A woman is shown being taken to her execution in Beijing, China, in 2001. The group said that five countries carried out 88 percent of all known executions worldwide: China (470 people), Iran (317), Saudi Arabia (143), Pakistan (135) and the United States (42). Exact figures for how many people were put to death in China are difficult to come by because the country considers the death penalty a ""state secret,"" Amnesty said. ""As the world and Olympic guests are left guessing, only the Chinese authorities know exactly how many people have been killed with state authorization,"" the group said. Last year, China reformed the way capital cases are handled, with the Supreme Court deciding all cases. This led to a drop in the number of executions, with ""half of the cases changed to a reprieve in the end,"" according to an article last week in China's state-run news agency, Xinhua. In December, the United Nations General Assembly called for a global end to the death penalty. But for now, the Amnesty report said, many countries continued to execute people for offenses that trigger much less severe sentences in other countries. In Iran, for example, a father of two was stoned to death for adultery. An Egyptian national was beheaded in Saudi Arabia for practicing sorcery. And a factory manager in North Korea was shot by a firing squad because he appointed his children as managers and made international phone calls.

"(CNN) -- At 14 years old, most teenagers think the stress of entering high school is enough. But Chinese golfer Andy Zhang, who enters high school next year, wasn't satisfied vying for girls and grades. He would rather take on the likes of Bubba Watson, Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson. Zhang has earned a spot as the youngest golfer to ever compete in the U.S. Open, which tees off Thursday at The Olympic Club in San Francisco, California, according to the USGA. Going into the week as an alternate, Zhang didn't think his chances were very good until England's Paul Casey withdrew with a shoulder injury and Zhang got called up. In true teenage fashion, Zhang said his cell phone ""exploded"" at the news. ""Everybody started texting me,"" he told CNN. ""I'm just really excited."" Official site of U.S. Open . Zhang grew up in Shandong Province in China, according to Yahoo Sports. He began golfing at the age of 6 and started working with a private coach at the age of 7. Three years later, his mother brought him to the United States for his first U.S. tournament in San Diego, California. He won the U.S. Kids Golf title for his age group that year and told his mom he wanted to stay. ""He looked at me and said, 'Mom, I don't want to go back to China. I want to stay here. I love the golf courses,"" Zhang's mother Hui Li told Golf Week. Zhang and his family then moved to Florida, where he began attending IMG Leadbetter Academy in Bradenton. Other notable athletes to come out of IMG academies include American football star Eli Manning and tennis stars Andre Agassi and Maria Sharapova. While at IMG Zhang had a notable success. In February, he set an IMG Junior Golf Tour record with a 9-under-par finish at the World Golf Village in Jacksonville, Florida, according to IMG Academy's blog. He also has lays claim to two regional youth championships in 2009 and 2010, according to the U.S. Kids Golf Foundation. But when his parents moved Zhang to the states, they never dreamed he would reach a national stage so early in his career. The task is undoubtedly daunting. ""Usually when I go to tournaments I have friends who are my same age who I can talk to,"" he told CNN. ""But here it's like Bubba Watson, Aaron Baddeley. I was like wow."" Watson picked up on Zhang's nerves during a shared practice round, telling media that the young player was very quiet. ""Or maybe I just talk too much,"" Watson said. Zhang later tweeted that he had a ""great practice round with Bubba ... thanks for all the help!"" Meanwhile, former World No.1 Woods, who failed to make the U.S. Open when he tried at age 15, told reporters recently that Zhang deserved the spot. ""That's the great thing about this game, it's not handed to you. You have to go out there and put up the numbers and he did,"" Woods said. Zhang will tee off Thursday morning with Hiroyuki Fujita and Mark Wilson who are 42 and 37 in the world respectively. ""I take this as a learning experience, if I can make the cut that would be awesome,"" he said. ""But I can't put any expectations to it, because I'm 14."" The USGA reports that Zhang will surpass Tadd Fujikawa, who played in the Open in 2006 at the age of 15, as the youngest player in the event's history. Zhang's chance at stardom comes just days after female Chinese golfer Shanshan Feng won her first LPGA title, becoming the first Chinese national to win a major title -- a testimony to the sport's growing popularity in China.","Chinese golfer Andy Zhang gains spot in the U.S. Open after two players injured .

"SAN FRANCISCO, California (CNN) -- Lesbian activist Del Martin, at the forefront of the battle for same-sex marriage in California, died Wednesday in San Francisco. She was 87. Martin's partner of 55 years, Phyllis Lyon, was by her side at the UCSF hospice, the National Center for Lesbian Rights said. Martin and Lyon, 84, tied the knot June 16 in a ceremony officiated by San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom. ""Ever since I met Del 55 years ago, I could never imagine a day would come when she wouldn't be by my side. I am so lucky to have known her, loved her and been her partner in all things,"" Lyon said. ""I also never imagined there would be a day that we would actually be able to get married. ""I am devastated, but I take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed."" Long before Massachusetts and then California legalized same-sex marriage, Lyon and Martin were integral parts of the early movement for lesbian and gay rights. They met in 1950 in Seattle, Washington, where they worked as editors of construction trade publications. They fell in love, moving in together on Valentine's Day 1953. Martin fought to have the American Psychological Society declare that homosexuality is not a mental illnesses and advocated on behalf of battered women. In 1955, the couple founded the nation's first lesbian organization, the Daughters of Bilitis, and launched the first lesbian publication, The Ladder. In the 1960s, they tried to get California lawmakers to introduce anti-discrimination bills and persuaded some police officers to stop harassing gays and lesbians at bars as part of a group Martin co-founded called the Council on Religion and the Homosexual. Martin was also a founding member of several other organizations, including the Lesbian Mother's Union, the San Francisco Women's Centers and the Bay Area Women's Coalition. She and Lyon were co-founders of the first gay political group in the United States, the Alice B. Toklas Democratic Club, named for author Gertrude Stein's long-time partner. After she and Lyon were the first lesbians to join the National Organization for Women with the couples' membership rate, Martin was the first open lesbian to be elected to NOW's board of directors. From that spot, she was instrumental in guiding the organization to pass a resolution recognizing lesbian issues as feminist issues. Martin and Lyon were delegates to the White House Conference on Aging in 1991, named to it by Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Nancy Pelosi, both of California. Kate Kendell, executive director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, called Martin ""a real hero."" ""For all of Del's life, she was an activist and organizer even before we knew what those terms meant,"" Kendell said. ""Her last act of public activism was her most personal: marrying the love of her life after 55 years. ""In the wake of losing her, we recognize with heightened clarity the most poignant and responsible way to honor her legacy is to preserve the right of marriage for same-sex couples, thereby providing the dignity and respect that Del and Phyllis' love deserved."" In 2003, lesbian filmmaker Joan E. Biren released ""No Secret Anymore: The Times of Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon,"" a 57-minute documentary focusing on the couple's activism and relationship. That year, the couple spoke to The Noe Valley Voice, a newspaper covering their San Francisco neighborhood, about the film and their drive to advance the rights of lesbians. ""We wanted our full rights and responsibilities,"" Martin told the Voice. Lyon said she and Martin had no particular secret on how to keep a relationship going for decades. ""If we had a secret, we would have written a book and made a million dollars,"" Lyon told the Voice. ""We love each other; we have similar interests. Our lives were very similar even before we met."" In 2004, San Francisco officials allowed gay couples in the city to wed, prompting a flood of applicants to the City Hall clerk's office. The officials chose Lyon, then 80, and Martin, then 83, to take the first vows. The state Supreme Court voided those unions. Lyon and Martin, however, joined more than 20 other couples as plaintiffs in a lawsuit challenging the state's marriage laws. On My 15, the California Supreme Court struck down the state's ban on same-sex marriage, paving the way for Lyon and Martin and other same-sex couples to marry in the state. A standing-room only crowd at San Francisco's City Hall on June 16 saw Lyon and Martin, in a wheelchair, take their vows. ""This is an extraordinary moment in history,"" Newsom said. ""I think today, marriage as an institution has been strengthened."" Del Martin identified her own legacy in 1984 when she said that her most important contribution was ""being able to help make changes in the way lesbians and gay men view themselves and how the larger society views lesbians and gay men."" In addition to Lyon, Martin is survived by daughter Kendra Mon, son-in-law Eugene Lane, granddaughter Lorraine Mon, grandson Kevin Mon and sister-in-law Patricia Lyon.","Del Martin fought for equal rights for gays and lesbians since the 1950s .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The Boy Scouts of America released a study Wednesday that claims children were safer from sex abuse in the Scouts than when at home or school. The report was prepared by a psychiatric expert hired by the Scouts to review so-called ""perversion files"" kept by the organization from 1970 to 1991. A newspaper review of the files published last week said they showed scouting officials ""failed to report hundreds of alleged child molesters to police and often hid the allegations from parents and the public."" In response, the Boy Scouts released what it said is an ""independent review"" by a University of Virginia psychiatry professor Wednesday, ahead of the ""increased media attention"" it expects with the release of more files. ""I believe that these files show that children in Scouting were safer and less likely to experience inappropriate sexual behavior in Scouting than in their own families, schools and during other community activities supervised by adults,"" Dr. Janet Warren wrote in her report. Sex abuse files prompt calls for Boy Scout ousters . The Los Angeles Times looked at 1,600 ""ineligible volunteer"" files obtained through a 1992 lawsuit in Oregon against the Boy Scouts, the newspaper said. The ""perversion files"" were a blacklist of alleged sexual molesters, it said. The Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, a sex abuse support group, said it was ""very upset"" by Warren's assertion that children were safer in the Scouts. ""That's an unsubstantiated, self-serving claim that sounds more like the writing of a spin doctor than a real doctor,"" SNAP Director David Clohessy said. SNAP called on the Boy Scouts last week to oust any official still with the organization who was involved in covering up child sex crimes. The Boy Scouts, in a statement last week, said it ""continuously enhanced its multi-tiered policies and procedures, which now include background checks, comprehensive training programs, and safety policies."" The organization's current education and training programs to protect children from abuse ""are among the best in the youth-serving community,"" Boy Scouts spokesman Deron Smith said. The Boy Scouts, in an open letter published Wednesday, said it would review the next batch of files to be released, covering 1965 to 1985, to ""ensure that all good-faith suspicion of abuse has been reported to law enforcement."" The Times reported that while the Scouts learned of most of the abuse allegations after they were reported to authorities, the organization was told about more than 500 instances from boys, parents, staff members or anonymous tips. ""In about 400 of those cases -- 80% -- there is no record of Scouting officials reporting the allegations to police,"" the Times reported. ""In more than 100 of the cases, officials actively sought to conceal the alleged abuse or allowed the suspects to hide it."" Warren's report said her ""review of these files indicates that the reported rate of sexual abuse in Scouting has been very low."" ""These files tell us precisely what researchers already knew, and have known for many years: some small number of men will use a position of trust and access to young people to pursue illegal sexual gratification,"" Warren wrote. ""This is a sad reality that has been with us throughout human history."" The professor noted that only 25 cases were documented from 1980, when there were about 1.1 million adults involved in Scouting. ""This indicates that 0.002 percent -- or 2 per 100,000 -- of all registered Scouting-involved adults in that year came to the attention of BSA because of alleged inappropriate sexual behavior with a child or adolescent,"" Warren said. ""This suggests that youth were safer in Scouting than in society at large."" Warren also disputed that the documents were ""secret files"" of hidden abuse. ""The files show a significant amount of public knowledge of the offenders and their unlawful acts,"" she said. ""For example, over 60% of the files made available to the public include some kind of public information. These public domain sources included newspaper articles, police reports, criminal justice records, and records of civil litigation."" Most of the men involved ""were arrested at some point in their lives for a sex crime."" she said. ""These data indicate that more often than not, the police, the courts, and the public were aware of inappropriate sexual behavior having been attributed to these individuals."" Opinion: What Scout abuse scandal teaches us . The professor also asserted that the ""claims of abuse were not swept under the carpet and ignored. Rather, suspected offenders were pursued and often times barred from Scouting over their fervent objection and at times even the opinion of the local community."" The ""small number"" of alleged offenders allowed back into Scouting were permitted ""because (they) had sought and received psychiatric treatment,"" she wrote. Warren concluded that the Scouts' system of ridding the organization of sex abusers ""was not perfect, and mistakes clearly occurred,"" but it ""functioned well in keeping many unfit adults out of Scouting."" SNAP's director said he was ""highly skeptical"" of Warren's claim that the Scouts' system functioned well. ""Compared with what? She apparently bases this on one source of information: the BSA files."" However, Clohessy said, ""initial reports seem to show that the Boy Scouts' response to sexual abuse is improving."" ""At the same time, we stand by our call to wait and see what real reform -- if any -- actually comes of these new developments,"" he added. ""For example, Warren's report indicates that there were still some abusers who were allowed back into Scouting after going through 'psychiatric treatment.' We would argue that no one who has been credibly accused of child sex abuse be allowed back into Scouting, period."" The report ""gives us some slight hope for change within the BSA, but we remain cautious,"" Clohessy said. CNN's Nick Valencia contributed to this report.","The Boy Scouts of America commissioned the ""independent review"" of its ""perversion files""

"MANCHESTER, New Hampshire (CNN)  -- Allen Raymond is living proof that political dirty tricksters do exist. ""I had a responsibility to my family,"" says Allen Raymond about his decision cooperate with investigators. The former Republican political operative went to federal prison after he pleaded guilty to charges of phone harassment. He jammed the phone lines of New Hampshire's Democratic Party on Election Day six years ago. ""The concept was to disrupt lines of communication. That's a fancy way of saying, 'make it so the phones didn't work,' "" Raymond said recently. ""No calls going out. No calls going in."" We're not going to give away exactly how Raymond did it. According to federal prosecutors, two top Republican Party officials tapped Raymond's Virginia-based telemarketing firm for the operation. Raymond then contracted out the job to a private phone bank in Idaho. Former New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairwoman Kathy Sullivan remembers the ensuing flood of hang-up calls that created havoc in her office. ""At first, people had various impressions about what was going on,"" Sullivan recalled. ""For example, at the Manchester field office, the young man who opened the office thought, 'The phones are all ringing off the hook. Nobody's here. I've broken the phone system. What did I do wrong?' And he was on the verge of tears.""  Raymond details how he jammed the system » . The operation also jammed the lines inside a firefighter's union hall in Manchester, New Hampshire, where Jeff Duval and other local firefighters were lining up car rides to help senior citizens get to the polls. ""It almost felt to me like an election might have been stolen,"" Duval said. ""I know for a fact that we received calls a few days later from people saying 'we tried to call you.' And I say 'did you get out and vote?' And they said 'no.' "" iReport.com: Are you voting early? Share your story . Looking back, Raymond said, he thinks the scheme was ingenious in an ""evil genius sort of way."" In his book, ""How to Rig an Election: Confessions of a Republican Operative,"" Raymond details how he got caught. An hour and a half into the jamming operation he received an e-mail from a Republican official, frantically telling him to shut down the calls. The e-mail read: ""Chairman wishes not to proceed with this project ... insists it violates federal law."" Federal agents eventually paid a visit to Raymond's office. Raymond decided to come clean about his role in the operation and cooperate with investigators. ""I felt like I had an obligation, and not obligation to my country or obligation to the people in New Hampshire, nothing like that,"" Raymond said. ""I had a responsibility to my family."" One of Raymond's alleged co-conspirators, James Tobin, was a top official with the National Republican Senatorial Committee that year. He went on to serve as George W. Bush's Northeastern regional re-election chairman in 2004. Tobin was initially convicted. But he succeeded in having that decision overturned by an appellate court. Just last week, Tobin was again indicted in the case on two counts of making false statements to a federal agent. His lawyer had no comment. Another co-conspirator and former chairman of New Hampshire's Republican Party, Charles McGee, pleaded guilty to phone harassment in the case and served seven months in prison. Democrats insist that the phone jamming operation in New Hampshire had national implications. The balance of power in the U.S. Senate was on the line that year and the Senate race between Democrat Jeanne Shaheen and Republican John Sununu was decided by just 19,000. Sununu won. Some state Democrats remain convinced that the phone jamming operation resulted in some votes lost. ""I think they were willing to do whatever it took to win, even if that meant breaking the law,"" Sullivan said. ""Even if that meant suppressing the votes. So if that means they were trying to steal the election, yes, then they were trying to steal the election."" Conservative author and Wall Street Journal columnist John Fund points out that there are dirty tricksters in both parties. ""No party has a monopoly on virtue,"" Fund said. Fund has also written a book about the problem, ""Stealing Elections: How Voter Fraud Threatens our Democracy."" His book focuses on the allegations facing more liberal groups like ACORN. Officials at the polls are unprepared for what could be a record turnout on Election Day, according to Fund. ""We need a lot more poll workers this time to handle the enormous crush of new voters,"" Fund said. ""We need more poll watchers and monitors, on both sides, to make sure each side is watching the other."" Allen Raymond learned that winning elections at all costs can come at a heavy price. ""I'm a felon,"" Raymond said. ""I think about it everyday. Every day, everything that I do every day, I try to do in such a way that makes up for that mistake."" Raymond doesn't plan to stop talking about his trip to the political dark side. He said a major Hollywood studio plans to begin production on a film version of his cautionary tale.","Allen Raymond went to prison for jamming phones of N.H's Democratic Party .

"(CNN) -- Crew members on a U.S.-flagged ship learned Friday that their questioning by Venezuelan investigators in an arms trafficking probe has been delayed until Monday. Venezuelan authorities have held the ship in Maracaibo since August 29, and took its captain into custody on Wednesday. The shipping vessel's crew had expected to give depositions on Friday, according to a crew member who asked to remain anonymous because of security concerns. As of Friday night, prosecutors had yet to make a decision on the case, according to a manager of the ship's customs brokers. The manager asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the situation. The captain and crew members were all expected to give statements to investigators, the manager said. The crew member who asked to remain anonymous said there were 14 crew members on board, plus the captain. Divers and drug investigators were inspecting the ship, and the captain was expected to be returned to move the ship from the docks to an anchorage in Maracaibo Bay on Saturday morning, the manager said Friday night. The manager identified the captain as Jeffrey Michael Raider, 45, of Texas. The crew member who asked to remain anonymous said via e-mail Saturday night that the captain in fact had been returned to the ship to command it during its move to anchorage in the bay. The captain "" is going back tonight. Every bit of news is speculative at this point,"" The crew member said in the Saturday night e-mail. U.S. State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell on Friday confirmed the ship and crew's detention. ""We understand this has to do with questions about customs paperwork for some rifles they had on board for self-protection,"" Ventrell told reporters. ""We, of course, know that the high seas and that piracy have been a major topic in recent months and years, and so that's something we've been combating. And indeed, it's normal for many ships to have some type of self-defense on board."" U.S. officials are seeking more information on the case, and Ventrell said that the absence of a U.S. ambassador in Venezuela isn't hampering the American response. U.S. President Barack Obama nominated an ambassador for Venezuela in 2010, but the Caracas government wouldn't allow him to assume the post. There is an active U.S. embassy in the country, however, and U.S. consular officials did visit the ship's crew members on Thursday night, according to the crew member. ""We still have a large mission in Venezuela with appropriate consular personnel,"" Ventrell said. ""I don't want to get into hypotheticals about what our relationship could be with Venezuela. We are where we are, and we'll continue to raise it as appropriate through diplomatic channels."" The Venezuelan Embassy in Washington said that ""this issue is being handled by our officials in Venezuela"" and didn't have additional immediate comments Friday, spokeswoman Marielba Alvarez told CNN on Friday. Officials in Venezuela, meanwhile, did not respond Friday to requests for comment. Soldiers boarded the ship Wednesday, herded the crew into the mess and met with Raider before taking him away, the crew member who asked to remain anonymous said by e-mail Thursday evening. Arrest warrants have been issued for the entire crew, according to this crew member, who added that he believes that authorities mostly want to talk to the crew for depositions. The situation appeared tense, but the manager of the ship's customs brokers said the government's actions have not been aggressive and that both sides are cooperating and being respectful. ""It's a legal process, but no one's rights have been violated,"" the manager said. The crew member, in another e-mail to CNN on Friday, said that though his colleagues were upset, no one had been mistreated. ""To be clear, at no point have we been threatened with physical injury, harm or death or had a gun pointed directly at our person. At all times the guns were pointed at the ground,"" the crew member said. The customs brokerage manager said he had never seen a situation in which a ship was detained and searched in such a way, ""but the authorities of this country must have their motives"" for doing so. In his Friday e-mail, the crew member gave a detailed account of what had happened since the ship docked in Maracaibo on August 29. A few hours after the ship arrived, it was boarded by officials from Interpol, Venezuelan police officers and narcotics investigators who said they had received a tip that the vessel was smuggling drugs, the crew member said. Members of two separate agencies searched the ship, including the crew members' rooms, with dogs. Then the Venezuelan authorities had the crew unload all the ship's cargo so they could search it, and again didn't find any contraband, the crew member said. At a previous Venezuelan port, authorities sent divers twice to inspect the ship's hull. But the officials did find weapons that the ship's security team keeps in a locker for travel through areas known for piracy, like the Gulf of Aden. The captain had declared the weapons on arrival in Maracaibo and got cleared to have them, according to the crew member. But the Venezuelan authorities said the ship didn't have permission to have them and confiscated them, he added. The guns are locked in a bonded area, and they are only for the use of the security company that owns them, the crew member said. On September 1, the crew was told the ship was under investigation for arms trafficking, and on Wednesday morning, the captain said the ship's crew was officially charged. The captain made a court appearance during the day Wednesday, September 5, and returned to the ship. That night, 20 to 30 armed soldiers demanded to be let aboard and left with the captain, the crew member said. The captain hasn't been back to the ship since, the crew member said, but he has talked on the phone to the chief mate. The sister of another crew member, who has been in regular contact with her brother and asked not to be identified for security reasons, said crew members have heard that the captain was charged with arms trafficking. The captain was detained after he refused to let authorities arrest the crew, she said. The customs manager said he expects that the process will play itself out and that the captain will be able to show he had declared the weapons. ""We are in contact with the government of Venezuela on the matter, and are working to provide all appropriate consular assistance at the earliest opportunity,"" said a U.S. State Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The Ocean Atlas, built in 2000, is a 393-foot-long multipurpose vessel with two electro-hydraulic cranes and a grain and bale capacity of 395,000 cubic feet, according the website of Intermarine, a managing agent of vessel operating companies. An Intermarine spokesman wasn't immediately available for comment Friday. The crew member who has been in contact with CNN lauded his union's efforts Saturday. ""One of the silver linings of out situation is seeing how our union, the Sefarers International Union, has really come for through for its members,"" he said. ""From the beginning, they were the first ones fighting for us and are working 24/7 to make sure this situation is resolved as soon as possible."" The crew member said life aboard the ship is tolerable, within limits. ""The mood is OK,"" he said. ""Nobody feels scared of physical harm. We just want to go home. Maybe we are wearing thin on the edges a little, but nothing bad."" CNN's Mariano Castillo, Catherine Shoichet, Elise Labott and Marilia Brocchetto, and journalist Osmary Hernandez contributed to this report.","NEW: Captain returned to vessel to move ship from docks, source says .

"(CNN) -- Two of Europe's biggest clubs staged dramatic comebacks on Tuesday as Arsenal rallied from 4-0 down to beat Reading 7-5 in the English League Cup while struggling Italian heavyweights AC Milan drew 2-2 at Palermo in Serie A. The results will have different impacts for both coaches, with manager Arsene Wenger's position seemingly safe at Arsenal while Milan boss Massimiliano Allegri will continue to face pressure as his side's indifferent form goes on. In Tuesday's only top-flight league game in Italy, Palermo led 2-0 shortly after halftime whereupon the under-fire Allegri changed his tactical plan to good effect, switching from his favored 3-5-2 to a 4-2-3-1 while also introducing Bojan Krkic as a substitute. The former Barcelona player had an instant impact, teeing up a goal for Riccardo Montolivo before Stephan El Shaarawy leveled the game 10 minutes from time, with the 20-year-old's seventh league goal of the season taking him to the top of the scoring charts. The point bought Allegri a little more breathing space as the seven-time European champions moved into the top half of the table, yet they still trail league leaders and old rivals Juventus by 14 points with just a quarter of the season gone. With Allegri's position under constant scrutiny and club president -- and former Italian Prime Minister -- Silvio Berlusconi having been sentenced to four years in prison for tax evasion, the start to Milan's season has been anything but easy. Wenger has also been criticized after mixed recent results, and his team -- featuring 11 changes from Saturday's hard-fought win over lowly Queens Park Rangers -- went 4-0 down after just 37 minutes against another team stuck in the Premier League's relegation zone. Seconds before halftime, Theo Walcott scored the first goal of a special hat-trick, with his second coming six minutes into stoppage time to force extra-time. The England international's his 120th-minute goal gave Arsenal a 6-5 lead, which was later extended by Morocco striker Marouane Chamakh's second of the match. ""The first set is for us, it was a tennis game today,"" joked Wenger afterwards. ""There were so many turning points. The goal to make it 4-1 just before halftime was important, as was the miracle goal in the (90th) minute."" Wenger was forced to face disgruntled supporters at a stormy annual general meeting last week, where many fans were unhappy to hear him place qualification for the UEFA Champions League above winning a trophy. The Gunners have failed to pick up any silverware since 2005 but they have now made it into the quarterfinals of the League Cup, on a night when fellow Premier League sides Sunderland, Wigan and Southampton all exited the competition. Meanwhile, Reading became the first team to score five goals in a non-qualifying round of either the League Cup or FA Cup and lose a game. Meanwhile, Spanish league leaders Barcelona began the defense of their Copa del Rey title with a 3-0 victory at third division team Deportivo Alaves. Regular first-teamers David Villa, Andres Iniesta and Cesc Fabregas scored in the first-leg tie, while fellow La Liga side Valencia won 2-0 at Llagostera. German Cup holders Borussia Dortmund reached the third round with a 4-1 win at second division Aalen, while fellow Bundesliga sides Schalke, Freiburg and Mainz also went through.","Arsenal stage stunning rally as they come from 4-0 down to beat Reading 7-5 in League Cup .

"(CNN)  -- A three-letter typo has slashed years off a prison sentence for a repeat drug offender in Ohio. Calvin Eugene Wells discovered a discrepancy on the verdict form for his conviction. Calvin Eugene Wells of Akron was sentenced in October 2005 to 10 years in prison after being convicted of possessing more than 100 grams of cocaine, a first-degree felony. Or so it seemed. While serving his time, Wells discovered a stray word on the verdict form signed by the jurors who convicted him in Summit County Common Pleas Court. The form, typed up by a court or prosecutor's office employee, read: . ""We, the Jury, find the Defendant Guilty of the offense of POSSESSION OF CRACK COCAINE. ""We, the jury, further find that the amount of crack cocaine WAS in the amount exceeding ten one hundred (100) grams as charged in the indictment."" See the document . The word ""ten"" in the second sentence is extraneous. Wells brought the error to a succession of attorneys' attention, but no one managed to turn it to his advantage until Jason Desiderio was appointed to represent him. ""I have never seen anything like this in my life, where just attorney after attorney did nothing,"" Desiderio said. ""I think he had four appellate attorneys, and one appeal ... It's a very, very bizarre case."" Under Ohio law, for a person to be found guilty of a higher-level felony, the jury form must state either the degree of the offense or the circumstances that would make it a higher offense. The form's second sentence apparently was an attempt to state those circumstances, but the stray word muddled the meaning, Desiderio said. A three-judge panel of the Ohio Court of Appeals unanimously agreed. ""The form is unclear, and we cannot determine what the jury understood 'ten one hundred (100) grams' to mean,"" Judge Eve Belfance wrote in the court's decision. ""It certainly could have meant an amount exceeding one hundred grams, but it is possible the jury believed the form actually meant an amount exceeding less than one gram."" Read the whole opinion . The uncertainty meant Wells could be convicted of nothing more than a fifth-degree felony, the judges ruled.

Williams, is retired. The Summit County prosecutor's office did not return calls seeking comment on Wells' case. ""At the end of the day, he was convicted, and I understand that some people are going to feel upset that he's essentially out six years earlier than anyone anticipated,"" Desiderio said. ""But in our system, we give the benefit of the doubt to the defendant, and we do that for good reason.

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad declined Sunday to guarantee the safety of his defeated rival Mir Hossein Moussavi in response to a question from CNN Chief International Correspondent Christiane Amanpour. President Ahmadinejad said he could not guarantee the safety of his rival, Mir Hossein Moussavi, pictured. ""There is rule of law in this country and all the people are equal before the law,"" Ahmadinejad said when Amanpour asked if he would guarantee Moussavi's safety. She also asked why opposition leaders had been arrested. ""In a soccer match, people may become excited and there may be confrontation between the people and the police force. People who violate traffic regulations will be fined by the police no matter who he is. These are not problems,"" Ahmadinejad said. When Amanpour asked a second time if Ahmadinejad would guarantee Moussavi's safety, he said he had already answered the question.  Watch as Amanpour questions Ahmadinejad » . There were conflicting reports on whether Moussavi had been placed under house arrest. Some reports indicated that he had been detained. Others said he was at home, conducting meetings but was free to come and go. Guards were stationed outside his house, but it was not immediately clear whether they worked for him or the government. Analysts had expected Moussavi, a former prime minister who is regarded as a reformist, to defeat Ahmadinejad.  Watch as Ahmadinejad is declared the winner » . Moussavi is credited for successfully navigating the Iranian economy during a bloody eight-year war with Iraq in the 1980s. And he enjoyed tremendous support among the youth.

Moussavi disputed the results, blaming ""untrustworthy monitors."" Independent election observers were banned from polling places.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda of Japan reorganized his cabinet ministers on Monday, bringing in a woman with strong links to China amid a smoldering dispute between the two nations over a group of remote islands. Noda named Makiko Tanaka, whose father oversaw the normalization of relations with China 40 years ago, as education minister -- one of string of new appointments. Tanaka, who served as foreign minister more than 10 years ago under former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, returns to the cabinet as Noda tries to manage the fallout from the clash with Beijing over the disputed islands in the East China Sea. Dangerous waters: Behind the islands dispute . Japan controls and administers the islands, but China says they are an integral part of its territory that Tokyo ""stole"" in the 19th century. The islands are known as Senkaku in Japanese and Diaoyu in Chinese. The Japanese government's announcement last month of the acquisition of several of the disputed islands from a Japanese family has heightened tensions between the two countries. Violent anti-Japanese protests have taken place in Chinese cities, and economic ties between Asia's two largest economies have started to sour. Meanwhile, patrol vessels from the two countries have been frequently locked in tense games of cat and mouse in the waters around the islands after China sent a flotilla of ships to the area. Chinese passion, fury fuels anti-Japan attacks . The appointment Monday of Tanaka to the cabinet may be interpreted as an effort to soothe those tensions by Noda. Her father, Kakuei Tanaka, was prime minister in 1972 when Tokyo and Beijing resumed diplomatic relations decades after Japan's occupation of large swathes of eastern China in the 1930s and 40s. She was nonetheless a controversial figure during her time as foreign minister at the start of this century for the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the political opponents of Noda's Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ). Koizumi sacked her in 2002, saying a public dispute between her and her top aides was effectively preventing critical budget bills from passing through parliament. She once reportedly called the Foreign Ministry a ""den of devils, an evil place where conspiracies are plotted."" Her outspokenness earned her bureaucratic enemies but gained her popularity with the Japanese public. How a remote rock split China and Japan . She also contradicted Koizumi's government policy on relations between China and Taiwan and on a controversial history textbook approved by Tokyo that critics in Asia said whitewashed Japanese war crimes. It is unclear what influence she will have on diplomatic relations in her role as education minister. Koichiro Gemba will remain as foreign minister under the reshuffle. The others changes to Noda's cabinet included the appointment of Koriki Jojima, a senior DPJ lawmaker, as finance minister.","Makiko Tanaka is appointed to the post of education minister .

"Paris (CNN) -- Lawyers for Dominique Strauss-Kahn pushed back Tuesday against allegations that he facilitated prostitution in France, saying there was ""no significant evidence"" the former International Monetary Fund chief knew young women at parties he attended were being paid for sex. Other suspects held over an investigation into prostitution centered around the city of Lille ""said that Dominique Strauss-Kahn did not know that these women were being paid,"" Strauss-Kahn's lawyer Henri Leclerc said in a news conference. ""We hear that these women say otherwise. Well, no! I can tell you these women do not say otherwise,"" he said. Strauss-Kahn was formally warned Monday that he is under investigation for ""aggravated pimping"" for accusations that he participated in a prostitution ring, prosecutors said. He is not allowed to have contact with other people involved in the investigation, nor is he permitted to talk to the media about the case. Strauss-Kahn was released under a â‚¬100,000 ($133,000) bail, according to prosecutors. Strauss-Kahn is now at a point in the French legal system that comes after an arrest and before formal charges are filed. He faces allegations of habitual involvement in a prostitution racket. The description of the alleged crime as ""aggravated"" means it took place on a regular and involved basis, and ""pimping"" means facilitating a prostitution operation, not just being a customer. Leclerc said it was possible to question his client's morals, but that he had not broken the law. ""We can criticize in terms of virtue, in terms of how a man should conduct himself,"" the lawyer said. ""But in reality, this is just unruly conduct. You can hate it, you may not find it virtuous -- everyone is entitled to their own opinion -- but it is not a crime."" Frederique Beaulieu, another lawyer for Strauss-Kahn, said Tuesday: ""You have to remember that in our country having relations with a prostitute is not a crime."" While prostitution is not illegal in France, profiting from the prostitution of another person is against the law, according to the French Penal Code. Authorities are also investigating whether corporate funds were used to pay for the prostitutes. Leclerc said in December that there was no evidence that such funds were misappropriated. Last month, Strauss-Kahn was held for more than 24 hours by police in Lille and questioned about alleged involvement in the prostitution ring. His attorneys released a statement in November calling the allegations against their client ""unhealthy, sensationalist and not without a political agenda."" The prostitution probe, nicknamed the ""Carlton Affair"" by the French press, kicked off in October. It centers around the city of Lille, w3here investigators began looking into claims that luxury hotels, including the Carlton, served as a base for a high-profile prostitution network. In December, Strauss-Kahn's attorney Leclerc acknowledged in an interview with radio station Europe1 that his client attended sex parties, but said Strauss-Kahn was unaware the women in attendance were prostitutes. A hotel manager and four other men were arrested late last year in connection with the investigation. The Carlton Affair continues a string of sexual allegations against Strauss-Kahn. He has not been convicted of any crime. One of the sex scandals torpedoed his expected run for the French presidency this year. He stepped down from the top job at the IMF after that incident, in which a New York hotel maid accused him of sexual assault and attempted rape in May. He denied the accusation. The case ultimately fell apart after prosecutors decided they could not be sure about the credibility of the alleged victim, despite forensic evidence that showed a sexual encounter had occurred. Strauss-Kahn also faced allegations of attempted rape from a young French writer. Tristane Banon filed a complaint, alleging a 2003 attack, though it could not be pursued because of a statute of limitations. Strauss-Kahn denied the allegations and has since filed a countersuit in France, alleging slander. CNN's Brian Walker contributed to this report.","Attorney: There is no evidence Strauss-Kahn knew women at sex parties were paid .

"(CNN) -- Forget the butterfly effect. In a globalized century, it's a totally different effect you have to be worried about. Steven Soderbergh's new movie, ""Contagion,"" is a star-powered thriller that hops from Chicago to Hong Kong, London, Minneapolis, Geneva and beyond. Each port of call brings another familiar face: Gwyneth Paltrow looking green and jet-lagged, Matt Damon as her tired and bewildered husband, Laurence Fishburne coordinating the response for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Kate Winslet (wonderful), who is first in the field as the American fatalities begin to mount. Jude Law is an Aussie blogger who smells the story before anyone in the mainstream media. Marion Cotillard is a World Health Organization scientist collecting data from the initial carrier in China. The English actress Jennifer Ehle is a revelation as another research scientist striving to find a cure. If this all sounds like an old-fashioned disaster movie, that's not quite it. Soderbergh is a great systems director. He's fascinated with process, with mapping stuff out. Think of the networks of crime and punishment in ""Traffic,"" or the labyrinthine ingenuity of the ""Ocean's"" capers. So, yes, this is a disaster movie on a massive scale, with a death toll exceeding 8 million before it's even halfway done, but the emotional temperature remains cool and analytical. There's certainly a shock factor when we see one famous star dissected on the autopsy table, but there's not an awful lot of emotion here. In many ways this restraint is admirable. Soderbergh and screenwriter Scott Burns (""The Informant!"") do their best to resist the urge to furnish each star turn with a potted melodrama. What the news guys used to call ""human interest"" flows from the inexorable progress of the epidemic and the imperfect and largely ineffectual systems the humans put in place to control it, not from whatever soap operas these folks have playing out in the private lives. Though of course their professional actions are never entirely impersonal. Heroes and villains do emerge. The former oftentimes buck the system and defy authority to protect their loved ones and assert their autonomy as best they can. Interestingly enough, it's the same with the villains. In the face of a catastrophic social breakdown, morality itself slides into a gray zone where the old rules no longer make sense. At the same time, the movie asks tricky questions about privilege and power that resonate well beyond the obvious echoes of swine flu and SARS. Soderbergh, who photographs his own movies under the pseudonym ""Peter Andrews,"" is a superb technician. For long stretches, ""Contagion"" is a model of lucidity and clean, crisp storytelling. I couldn't help thinking it's too clean, too antiseptic even, to do full justice to such a grim worst-case scenario. We're only a whisper away from a George Romero zombie movie, after all, but in his rough and ready way, Romero would surely have given us something much bloodier, funnier and scarier, something that would hit us in the gut as hard as the brain. ""Contagion"" is impressive on many levels and honestly depressing, too, but it never quite matches Romero's trick -- it never brings the dead to life.","The film 'Contagion' is chock-full of big-name actors .

"(Mashable) -- FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski announced a five-step plan on Wednesday to update the technology that powers the 911 emergency response system. The plan will enable the transmission of text messages, voice calls, videos and photos, as well as automatic location information. The FCC hopes that such a plan will enable emergency responders to respond faster while also giving individuals more options for contacting 911, depending on the emergency situation. Implementation of Next Generation 911 (NG911), the official project name, will be charted by the following five-step plan, according to the FCC's press release: . 1. Develop location accuracy mechanisms for NG911 . 2. Enable consumers to send text, photos, and videos to public safety answering points (NPRM) 3. Facilitate the completion and implementation of NG911 technical standards . 4. Develop an NG911 governance framework . 5. Develop an NG911 funding model . Genachowski began working on this plan last year. His catalyst for taking action was the fact that trapped students could not text 911 during the Virginia Tech campus shootings in 2007. Being that texting has replaced talking in the teen demographic, this plan seems like a step in the right directions, as it aligns with the evolving nature of telecommunications. What are your thoughts on this new plan to roll out text, voice, photo and video for 911 emergency response? Let us know in the comments. © 2011 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- The death toll mounted Thursday as survivors struggled to regain a semblance of the normalcy that Superstorm Sandy swept away this week when it struck the Northeast. In some cases, tempers grew short. ""We're gonna die down here!"" wailed Donna Solli to Sen. Chuck Schumer as he toured her waterlogged neighborhood in New York's Staten Island with a group of reporters. ""When is the government coming?"" Solli said residents needed gas, food and clothes. ""We're gonna freeze,"" she said on a day when the 50-degree temperature was predicted to drop to the low 40s. ""We've got 90-year-old people!"" The Democratic senator from New York said he understood and hugged her. Solli said her basement was flooded and her refrigerator was upside down. ""I stayed here because I have an elderly dog,"" she told a reporter. ""We nearly drowned."" Solli added that she had had little to eat. ""One slice of pizza in 48 hours."" As he surveyed the damage in the neighborhood, the politician told a reporter, ""This is the worst thing I've ever seen, and it's killing me what these people have to go through. We'll get whatever federal help we can, that's for sure."" Afterward, a senior administration official told CNN that a convoy of 10 Red Cross trucks filled with food, water and medicine arrived Thursday evening on Staten Island. Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano and FEMA Deputy Administrator Richard Serino were to travel Friday to Staten Island to meet with state and local officials and view the response and recovery efforts, the White House said. Some people were not complaining. About 90 miles north of Staten Island, the mayor of Danbury, Connecticut, Mark D. Boughton, was visiting a special-needs shelter on Wednesday night when he met a 106-year-old woman who had cancer and was in hospice. ""She's happy to be alive,"" he tweeted. ""Every day is a gift."" Contacted by telephone, Boughton said the cheerfulness of the lifelong resident of Danbury had inspired him. ""The essence of it was, look, you gotta make each day count,"" he said. ""You don't know when your time comes."" In Sandy's wake, at least 157 people died, at least 88 of them in the United States, two in Canada and 67 in the Caribbean. Among them were two children whose bodies were found Thursday. The boys, ages 2 and 4, had been riding with their mother, Glenda Moore, on Staten Island when the storm surge swamped their SUV, authorities said. Police said Moore gave them this account: When her Ford Explorer was blown into a hole, she got out, took out her children and carried them to a nearby tree. There, she held on to the boys, Brandon and Connor, as rain poured and hurricane-strength winds gusted. After hours, she walked with her children to a nearby house to seek help. A man opened the door but refused to let them in. Desperate, she went to his back porch and threw a flower pot at the window in an attempt to get inside. But she was not able to do so. Meanwhile, her children were swept away. Their bodies were found nearby on Thursday. Relatives said Moore was too distraught to speak with CNN. The owner of the house, who asked that he not be identified, disputed Moore's account, saying he saw only a man. ""He didn't come to the door, he came on the stairs at the back of the house, and he was standing at the bottom of the stairs,"" said the man. ""He took a concrete flower pot and threw it through the door."" The man at the door, he said, didn't ask to enter the house, but instead asked the owner of the house to leave it in order to help. ""What could I do to help him?"" he asked. ""I'm wearing the same clothes ... the same shorts and flip-flops I had that night. And I was going to come out?"" The man told CNN he sat up for the rest of the night, with his back against the door in the kitchen. He said the deaths were a tragedy, but that the woman was at fault. ""She shouldn't have been out,"" he continued. ""She shouldn't have been out on the road."" There was nothing he could have done, he added. ""I'm not a rescue worker ... If I would have been outside, I would have been dead."" Interactive: Remembering the victims . Sandy claimed at least 37 lives in New York City, Mayor Michael Bloomberg told reporters Thursday. Victims fall to Mother Nature's wrath . Authorities in nine states worked to restore basic services such as public transit and electricity. In New York City, nearly 500,000 customers were without power. In Manhattan, many of the 220,000 customers without electricity were south of Midtown's 34th Street. Parts of Queens and Staten Island also had no electricity Thursday. ""Restoring power will take a lot of time,"" the mayor said. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, in a letter to utilities, warned of consequences if authorities discover that they failed to prepare properly. ""Under such circumstances, I would direct the Public Service Commission to commence a proceeding to revoke your certificates,"" he wrote. That message was not lost on its intended targets. ""We're doing our damnedest to get our power back as quickly as possible,"" said John Miksad, senior vice president of electric operations at Con Ed. New York's vast transit network remains hobbled. The Metropolitan Transit Authority said 14 of the city's 23 subway lines were running and a flotilla of 4,000 buses was attempting to take up the slack. For some, Thursday's commute into Manhattan from the outer boroughs took five hours. Bloomberg predicted that would ease as tunnels are cleared of water, power is restored to subway lines and ferries resume service. Electricity or not: Tale of two cities . Getting water out of the tunnels is ""one of the main orders of business right now,"" Cuomo said. Broadway theaters reopened Thursday, and organizers vowed to hold the New York City Marathon as scheduled on Sunday. Event organizer Mary Wittenberg said the race wouldn't divert resources from the recovery. Sandy's effects, state by state . Three days after Sandy barreled ashore in southern New Jersey, search-and-rescue crews were going door-to-door in some neighborhoods looking for people, particularly the elderly, who may have been stranded by the power outages, the debris and remaining floodwater. Sandy killed at least six people in New Jersey, said Gov. Chris Christie, who had warned people in low-lying areas to evacuate. Dangling crane secure, engineers say . Christie asked for patience as crews worked to restore electricity to more than 2 million power company customers. The federal government shipped 1 million meals Thursday to New York, where National Guard troops were distributing them to people in need, Cuomo told reporters. Mobile networks team up to help . The storm dumped up to 3 feet of snow in West Virginia and Maryland, leaving thousands without power. Nearly 3.5 million customers across the eastern United States were still in the dark Thursday, down from nearly 8 million in its immediate aftermath. How to help . By Thursday, Sandy's remnants had headed into Canada. The National Weather Service predicted a nor'easter next week from the mid-Atlantic states into New England. But the forecast said the storm would be far weaker than Sandy. CNN's Chelsea J. Carter, Tom Watkins, Joe Sterling and Melissa Gray contributed to this report.","Superstorm Sandy deaths reach 157 overall, including at least 88 in the U.S.

"TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- Toshiba said Tuesday it will no longer manufacture HD DVDs, effectively ending the long-running battle with the rival Blu-ray for a dominant high-definition format. People watch a demonstration of HD DVD at the 2008 International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Toshiba said it made the decision to cease developing, manufacturing, and marketing HD DVDs after ""recent major changes in the market."" It promised to continue offering support and service for all existing Toshiba HD DVD products. ""We carefully assessed the long-term impact of continuing the so-called 'next-generation format war' and concluded that a swift decision will best help the market develop,"" Toshiba President and Chief Executive Atsutoshi Nishida said in a news release. Toshiba's HD DVD business has been suffering recently with a string of major retailers and rental companies announcing their preference for Blu-ray, developed by Sony.  Watch video on the battle of the formats » . Last week alone, Wal-Mart and online rental company Netflix said they would abandon HD in favor of Blu-ray. Last month, Warner Brothers Home Entertainment -- which had been the largest media company releasing videos in both formats -- announced it would offer DVDs solely in Blu-ray. The DVD battle has been reminiscent of the VHS vs. Beta fight in the early 1980s. It has left many consumers confused and waiting to see which technology will emerge as the industry standard. Sony's Blu-ray is backed by Disney, 20th Century Fox, MGM, Dell, Panasonic, and Philips. Toshiba's HD DVD is backed by Paramount, Universal Pictures, Microsoft, Sanyo, and NEC. Toshiba said it would continue to work with those companies and study ways to collaborate with them in the future. Tens of billions of dollars have been at stake as major movie studios battled for a dominant format. But rival game consoles have been part of the struggle, too -- Sony's Playstation 3 plays Blu-ray discs, while the Microsoft Xbox will play HD DVDs if users install an add-on component. Both Blu-ray and HD are high-definition DVDs, the successor to ordinary DVDs which show pictures only in standard definition. But Blu-ray and HD involve different hardware and are not compatible with each other, meaning consumers have had to decide which system to invest in. Both formats have an excellent picture quality with a large storage space. But Toshiba has lost the battle because it lacks a retail presence in many markets, said Carl Gressum, a senior analyst at Ovum, a London technology consultancy. ""They didn't manage to bring on board some of the China vendors, they didn't bring (on board) the retailers, they've failed to develop in the European and Asian markets,"" Gressum told CNN. Warner Brothers announced its decision to drop HD DVD right before last month's International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, a significant event for corporate buyers. Gressum said that led to an immediate drop in retail support for Toshiba's format. Gressum said manufacturers of both formats have made things more difficult for retailers by forcing consumers to make a choice between the gradually-dominant Blu-ray and the much-cheaper HD. ""They're losing money in many cases because of the price war between the two formats as Toshiba -- and also Microsoft, to a certain extent -- has been playing the price card for HD DVD players,"" he said. Toshiba said the company would continue to market standard DVD players and recorders. E-mail to a friend .","Toshiba says it will no longer make or market HD DVD players and recorders .

"(CNN) -- Britain and France are calling for an additional 3,000 United Nations troops in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the U.N. already has its biggest peacekeeping mission, a senior British diplomat said Wednesday. A U.N. peacekeeper rides atop an armored vehicle last week in Goma, Democratic Republic of Congo. Mark Malloch-Brown, the British Foreign Office minister for Africa, the Middle East and the United Nations, announced a draft resolution on the troop increase while on a four-day mission to the war-torn Congo. Britain expects the U.N. Security Council to adopt the resolution by the end of the week, a spokeswoman for the British mission to the United Nations said. The resolution follows calls from the United Nations' own peacekeeping experts, Human Rights Watch, and local human rights groups in Congo for more troops to support the 17,000 U.N. soldiers already there. A coalition of 44 organizations in eastern Congo wrote to the Security Council on Tuesday, pleading for more troops. ""This would help to prevent the atrocities that continue to be committed against civilians on an ever greater scale here in North Kivu [province], on the border of Rwanda and Uganda,"" the coalition wrote. Fighting between government forces, allied militias and rebels under the command of Laurent Nkunda has forced an estimated 250,000 people to flee their homes since August. ""Since August 28, fighting has intensified in many areas, causing deaths, rapes, lootings, forced recruitment and further displacements of civilian populations,"" the local coalition wrote. ""The population has thus been immersed in unspeakable suffering. In the last few days, fighting has drawn closer to large populated areas, such as the town of Goma. Fighting has also invaded and torn apart the region of Rutshuru, particularly in the town of Kiwanja, where hundreds of civilian deaths have now been recorded."" The letter echoes concerns expressed by the British aid group Oxfam last week. ""The world is failing in its responsibility to protect the Congo's innocent civilians,"" Juliette Prodhan, the head of Oxfam in Congo, said in a statement released November 13.  Watch international efforts to avoid a health catastrophe in Congo » . ""There has been an increase in incidents of forced labor, rape and widespread brutality, according to assessments carried out by international agency Oxfam over the past week, as armed men from all sides prey upon those who have sought 'sanctuary' from the fighting in North Kivu"" province, she said. Another aid group, World Vision, says the conflict in the African country is the deadliest since World War II. The country has been at war since 1997. ""The last decade of conflict has resulted in some 4 million deaths; an estimated 1,200 people die every day due to ongoing epidemics and war-related causes; some aid agencies estimate upward of 1,400 deaths per day,"" World Vision said in a statement. The local groups in Congo specifically requested help from the European Union, which can deploy military units faster than the United Nations can. Georgette Gagnon, the executive director for the Africa division of Human Rights Watch, said she also would like to see the European Union send troops. ""Our concern is that it is going to take three months [for the United Nations] to get anybody on the ground,"" she said. ""Our request is for the EU to send a bridging force. The EU has done this in the past for the Congo, and they have the capacity to get people on the ground within two weeks."" The ""goal would be provide civilian protection, to do patrols and other things that would prevent looting, pillaging and raping by either the Congolese troops -- which are doing this -- or the rebel group,"" she said. The European Union has not announced plans to send troops to police the conflict. A spokeswoman for the British mission to the United Nations said London is ""not ruling in or out EU forces,"" instead focusing on strengthening the U.N. presence in eastern Congo.","Peacekeeping mission in Democratic Republic of Congo is already U.N.'s largest .

"(CNN) -- Thousands of people who fled fighting in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo are crossing back into rebel-held territory because they say conditions at refugee camps are intolerable. A crowd of refugees gathers at the entrance to a USAID center near Goma in the Democratic Republic of Congo. With no food, water or sanitation in the camps, people have decided that it is worth the risk to return to their homes, even though rebels killed and raped many people just last week, residents told ITN's Jonathan Miller, who is near the city of Goma. Many of their villages have been looted and emptied of people by the rebels, they said. Roads were filled with people returning to rebel-held territory, carrying their belongings on their heads or on their backs. However, others, fearful of fresh violence, continued to leave their homes, overwhelming aid centers.  See photos of the refugee camps » . Aid groups were expected to travel into the Congo's rebel-held territory on Sunday to help tens of thousands of people displaced by the latest bout of rebel fighting. On Saturday, aid groups delivered food and water to a refugee camp north of Goma, traveling through a narrow ""humanitarian corridor"" the rebels established following a cease-fire with government forces that the rebels announced Wednesday. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said the international community cannot allow Congo to become ""another Rwanda,"" where 800,000 died during a 1994 genocide. Western diplomats shuttled between Goma -- the scene of some of the worst fighting -- and Kigali, in neighboring Rwanda, to meet with leaders in order to get a peace process back on track.  Watch the diplomatic efforts » . ""The immediate needs are obvious,"" said British Foreign Secretary David Miliband and French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner in a joint statement Sunday. ""We saw them yesterday. The cease-fire last Wednesday needs to be bolstered,"" Miliband and Kouchner said. ""The humanitarian needs for food, shelter, water and health care must be met through universal provision and secure routes for delivery."" The cease-fire seemed to be holding Sunday, but both sides appeared to be massing troops near the cease-fire line. Government soldiers flew in from the capital Kinshasa and deployed in the jungle, and rebels were out in force on their side of the line. ITN reporter Miller heard intermittent firing from the hills that mark the line where the two sides face off only a few hundred yards apart. A small contingent of United Nations troops in the area donned flak jackets and helmets in response.  Watch report on gunfire near cease-fire line » . Miller said it was not clear if the two sides were firing at each other. The latest fighting broke out on October 24 when Congolese rebels led by renegade Tutsi General Laurent Nkunda launched renewed attacks in the eastern province of North Kivu. It came days after a tenuous week-old U.N.-brokered cease-fire between rebels and government forces fell apart. The fighting between Nkunda's rebels and Congolese army regulars displaced thousands of civilians almost immediately, the United Nations said. Many of the displaced fled to Goma, the capital of North Kivu, which borders Rwanda and Uganda. Nkunda is the leader of the National Congress for the Defense of the People. His rebel forces declared a cease-fire late Wednesday after four days of fighting. The fighting is based on ethnic grievances. Nkunda says he is fighting to protect his Tutsi community from attacks by Rwandan Hutu rebels. During the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, the country's Hutu majority killed 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus, according to the United Nations. When Tutsis came to power in Rwanda, many Hutus crossed the border into Congo.  They were afraid to return home, fearing they would be targeted for revenge by Tutsis, so they remained in the jungles of eastern Congo, where they preyed on local residents. In May 2005, it was reported that Rwandan Hutu rebels in eastern Congo carried out hundreds of summary executions, rapes, beatings and kidnappings of Congolese civilians in the province of South Kivu, according to GlobalSecurity.org. Nkunda, a Tutsi, has repeatedly blamed the Congolese government for failing to protect the Tutsis from attacks by Rwandan Hutus. Copyright 2008 CNN.

"(CNN) -- The survival of several hundred rare gorillas is threatened by rebel fighters who have taken over the animals' sanctuary, a spokeswoman for the Virunga National Park said Tuesday. File photo: Young gorillas play in Congo's Virunga Park. The gorilla sector of the park ""has been swallowed up in this conflict,"" said Samantha Newport, communications director for the refuge. She fears for the animals' safety, not least because mountain gorillas do not always flee the sound of gunfire and mortars, she said. ""There are documented cases of the gorillas getting caught in the crossfire and getting killed,"" she said. ""It's the chaos of war and they are right in the middle of it."" That leaves the situation ""extremely precarious"" for the critically endangered species, she said. About 200 of the world's 700 known mountain gorillas lived in the park when rebel leader Laurent Nkunda's men took control of the gorilla section last year, Newport said. At least nine gorillas are known to have been killed in Virunga National Park last year. There are no mountain gorillas in captivity, she added. ""The mountain gorillas live in the wild. They don't reproduce in captivity."" Nkunda's fighters seized the headquarters of the park on October 26, park officials announced last month, a move park director Emmanuel de Merode called ""unprecedented."" The seizure forced hundreds of rangers who normally monitor the gorillas to flee. The rangers ""track and monitor the mountain gorillas,"" freeing them from snares and intervening medically in life-threatening situations, Newport said. ""It's really important to keep track on a daily basis."" That has been impossible for weeks, she said. ""There has been a complete lack of knowledge about the gorillas for some time. Nkunda's forces control about 50 percent of the park, including the gorilla sector."" The gorilla section of the park lies in a strategically important area near the borders of Rwanda and Uganda, she explained. Fighting between Congolese government soldiers and rebels led by Nkunda has displaced more than 250,000 people. That's in addition to roughly 800,000 who already had been driven from their homes, according to the United Nations. On Sunday, even as there was fighting in North Kivu province, Nkunda met with Olusegun Obasanjo, the U.N. special envoy for the area. ""Laurent Nkunda engaged on two things in my presence: the respect of the ceasefire on the one hand and on the other, the maintenance of humanitarian corridors in order to give unconditional access to assist vulnerable populations,"" Obasanjo said following the meeting. But Obasanjo said nobody could say for certain what Nkunda wanted to gain from his offensive. Virunga National Park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and Africa's oldest national park. It was formerly known as Albert National Park .","Rebel offensive threatens rare gorillas in Congo national park .

"(Rolling Stone) -- Jack White left his Radio City Music Hall audience confused and angry on Saturday night when he abruptly left the stage and ended the show after only playing for about 55 minutes. Over the short course of a 12-song set backed by his all-male band, White stuck mostly to his new material with high-energy takes on ""Sixteen Saltines"" and ""Hypocritical Kiss,"" plus four White Stripes songs; he sprinted to the piano for a new version of ""Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground"" and strapped on his Telecaster for an epic ""Ball and Biscuit."" Despite the crowd's visible enthusiasm, White seemed displeased with its energy level. ""Jesus Christ, is this an NPR convention?"" he asked after ""Love Interruption"" -- a perplexing statement, since the entire floor was standing and cheering. (Later, he asked the crowd to quiet down, ""because I can't hear myself think."" They cheered anyway.) White regularly eggs on his crowds with sarcastic banter. At one point, he also suggested performing the rest of the show acoustically, which he joked only ten percent of fans would want. Jack White Drops Video Directed by Hype Williams . Soon afterward, White made a short announcement before leaving the stage, leaving some fans wondering if it was just an intermission (maybe he'd be returning with his all-female band?) or a ploy for encore hype. The audience stuck around for several minutes after White's disappearance, expecting him to return even as roadies emerged to unplug instruments and shut off the amps. The waiting crowd broke into a ""Seven Nation Army"" singalong, but once the curtain went down, the song quickly devolved into booing and some shouting of ""F--- Jack White."" Premiere: Jack White Jams in the Woods at Outside Lands . According to the New York Observer, the ushers at the concert seemed equally mystified by its early ending, and a member of the security team later offered an explanation to the reporter. ""He wasn't happy with the sound,"" he said. ""I don't know why he pulled that."" The paper also noted that White had several ""angry exchanges"" with a shirtless fan in the front row who was removed by security. After clearing the auditorium, a loud and disgruntled crowd of about 100 fans reportedly gathered outside the venue near the main backstage exit, banging on parked cars.

"(CNN) -- A fixture of the presidential race has been Mitt Romney's 47% problem: Those Americans who don't pay federal income tax that Romney has described as freeloaders. Of course, Romney has retracted his remark. But if he still wants to attack those who freeload off of U.S. taxpayers, there is a better target: Our wealthy overseas allies. Forty-seven percent is also roughly the U.S. share of global military spending. Our annual $700 billion-plus military budget exceeds the next 10 biggest military budgets combined. Much of that money buys forces needed to defend allies against threats they could afford to meet themselves. Alliances that once served the U.S. national interest have become a subsidy to rich allies. In a recent foreign policy speech, Romney noted that only three of the 28 NATO allies meet their commitment to spend 2% of their GDP on defense. He promises to fix that by asking our allies to honor their commitment to security spending. But the Europeans have grown adept at keeping a straight face while ignoring such lectures. If Romney wants them to do more, he should suggest giving them less -- a logic he appreciates in domestic contexts. The same would apply to the Japanese, South Koreans and various others we defend. Some allies, especially in Asia, might increase military spending. Others, noting less danger and bulging debts, may not. Washington is not the best judge of others' needs. But with fewer commitments, we can maintain fewer forces and lower future military costs, which means more savings for U.S. taxpayers. As long as the United States bears the lion's share of global defenses, our allies have little incentive to do more. As we saw in Libya in 2011, the U.S. Air Force enabled NATO's intervention by providing air refueling, intelligence and precision strike capability. Our combat-tested Army and Marine Corps are the envy of their counterparts around the world, many of whom they train. Our special operations forces track terrorists everywhere. Romney complains that our Navy has fewer ships than before World War I but fails to mention that it is far bigger than any other fleet and is the police force of the global seas. Romney has insisted that U.S. exceptionalism compels us to steady alliances, settle regional disputes and forcefully promote democracy everywhere. But he has reversed the idea of U.S. exceptionalism. Early American leaders thought that the nation's virtue lay in liberal values and the example America sets. For them, U.S. exceptionalism had nothing to do with military adventurism. Permanent allies might drag us into others' disputes, imperiling liberalism by centralizing power in the presidency and requiring a massive military establishment. Similar worries encouraged President Eisenhower's push to keep our commitments to allies temporary. In 1953, Western Europe and Japan were still recovering from World War II and South Korea, with our help, was still fighting the North and its Chinese allies. U.S. commitments to defend those nations came from fear that the Soviet Union would capitalize on their weakness, through conquest or internal intrigue, and gather enough strength to threaten us directly. Those allies long ago grew rich enough to defend themselves, and the Soviet Union has been history for decades. The European Union collectively has a population and economy larger than ours. But while Americans spend about $2,700 per capita annually on the military, NATO allies average around $500. More than 20 years after the end of the Cold War, Europeans sit in cafes while over 80,000 American service personnel still help guard Europe against Russia, which now has a GDP around the size of Spain and Portugal combined. Sixty years after the end of Korean War, nearly 30,000 American forces still shield the South against a Northern neighbor with a 25th of its wealth and half its population. We have almost 50,000 troops in Japan almost 70 years after its surrender. Japan spends only about 1% of its GDP on its military, provides no troops to help stabilize Afghanistan, but insists that U.S. Marines defend their every rocky island in a possible dispute with China. Romney still has time to change his mind on this issue. Rather than lecturing our allies about their responsibilities, we should kick them off the dole, rescinding commitments to their defense and removing troops from their shores. This is a problem that any president faces, including President Obama. But Romney may make the problem worse through his proposed increase in military spending. If that seems chintzy, remember that there is virtue in economy and that we have needier causes at home, starting with the deficit. That tack might also prove politically useful: polls show that Americans would prefer to do less for rich allies. And foreign freeloaders can't vote. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Harvey Sapolsky and Benjamin Friedman.","Harvey Sapolsky, Benjamin Friedman: Our annual military budget is large .

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- Trading in a Chinese electrical appliances company was halted Monday after reports that its chairman -- the richest man in mainland China -- is under investigation on charges of stock market manipulation, the company said. The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong indefinitely halted trading in Gome Electrical Appliances Holding Ltd. amid reports of a police investigation of Wong Kwong Yu, the company's chairman, executive director and controlling shareholder, the company said in a statement. The company said it was looking into whether the allegations were true. The 39-year-old Wong is the richest person in mainland China, worth an estimated $6.3 billion, according to the 2008 China Rich List, which is compiled by the Hurun Institute. He topped the list for the third time in five years; the China Rich List was first compiled in 1999. The Beijing News reported that Wong is under police investigation for stock market manipulation, according to the state-run China Daily newspaper. Police declined to comment on the report, China Daily said. Gome Electrical Appliances said it ""is not in a position to confirm the accuracy of the information set out in the newspaper articles."" It also said it ""has not received any notice or legal documents in connection with the allegations from any regulatory, governmental or judicial authority in the People's Republic of China."" The company said trading was suspended Monday ""to avoid any disorderly market and volatility in the securities of the company that may result from further release of unverified allegations in the media."" It said it is ""making necessary inquiries for the purpose of verifying the allegations."" Established in 1987, Gome said it had 587 stores last year in 160 Chinese cities -- 572 traditional stores, 13 digital stores and two flagship stores. The company was incorporated in Bermuda, according to Gome's Web site.","Newspapers report China's richest man being investigated by police .

"(CNN) -- It was Tuesday afternoon when I found a trending article through Digg that seemed to explain why I'm not reaching my full potential for joy. And mind you, it had nothing to do with Pippa Middleton not returning my calls. Because that would be a very strange article for somebody to write. Dateline: Atlanta. Sad man waits by phone; needs shower. The article that was actually trending came from LiveScience, and the premise was that morning people are generally happier than night people. Though, as a small victory for us night owls, I would argue that morning people still have to, you know, wake up earlier. The article cites a study published in the June issue of the journal Emotion, which is not to be confused with the journal Emoticon that recently sent shock waves through the tech world when it revealed that chronic overuse of smiley faces may cause dysentery. We're all going to die. (Apparently on the Oregon Trail.) The research presented in Emotion reveals that only 7% of young adults describe themselves as being morning larks. Conversely, by age 60 most people have lost their affinity for staying up late. Basically, it's Leno and then to bed. But the common thread among both the older and younger subjects was that, regardless of age, morning people responded as being happier. And night people responded as having seen every single episode ever of ""Law and Order."" Advantage: Night people. The most interesting finding, however, is that just being awake early and seeing the morning sun isn't what actually makes people happy. Even my dog knows that if you get out of bed before, say, noon you're going to have a bad time. And this is a dog who spends the bulk of his waking hours blissfully licking his crotch. Study researcher Renee Biss, a graduate student at the University of Toronto, said one of the reasons morning people may be happier is because they tend not to suffer from social jet lag. Biss said, ""Society's expectations are far more organized around a morning-type person's schedule."" Apparently society's expectations don't include midnight ping pong. The article suggests hacking your sleep schedule, and Biss said, ""One way to do it is to increase your natural light exposure early in the morning."" Sadly, the light from my iPhone doesn't count. At least not when I play Angry Birds in bed. I did, however, find an app called Pocket UV Light and tested it out on my co-worker. ""Do you feel happier?"" ""No."" ""What about now?"" ""No."" ""What about now?"" ""Don't you ever do work?"" ""No. What about now?"" So that was 99 cents I'll never see again. Still, I was determined to find something that could provide natural light without actually having to get up and face the outside world and/or put on pants. As always, when times are tough, I turned to SkyMall. And that's where I found the Optimal Light Therapy System. For $189.95 this device delivers ""the optimal 10,000 lux of therapeutic light to counteract the effects of fatigue, jet lag, and Seasonal Affective Disorder."" I have no idea what a lux is, but I've always said 10,000 is the optimal number. So, this was promising. This was hope. Perhaps I had finally found my savior. (Current savior: Klondike bars.) Unfortunately, to reap the benefits of the Optimal Light Therapy System, you have to spend 30 minutes with your face in front of a blinding, bright light. That, they say, will ""block the release of melatonin."" But besides just being kind of weird, it requires, even at a minimum, sitting upright in bed. And that requires not sleeping. So, for now I guess I'm just going to stay a miserable night owl. At least until Pippa texts me back. Hey, Pipps! How bout some ping pong? :-) Uh oh. Here comes the dysentery.","In ""Apparently This Matters,"" CNN's Jarrett Bellini looks at trending topics online .

"London (CNN) -- Britain's Prince Philip, the husband of Queen Elizabeth II, is ""responding well"" to hospital treatment for a recurrence of a bladder infection, Buckingham Palace said Thursday. It is unclear when he will be discharged, but he is likely to remain in the hospital for a few more days, the palace said. The Duke of Edinburgh was admitted to the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary in Scotland Wednesday afternoon ""as a precautionary measure,"" the palace said. The 91-year-old, who first suffered the problem in June, fell ill again as he was staying at the royal residence in Balmoral, Scotland, where the queen traditionally spends part of the summer. It is the third time Philip has been admitted to a hospital in the past eight months. Before the bladder infection, which he initially contracted during events marking the queen's diamond jubilee, he spent four nights in a hospital over the Christmas holiday last year for treatment of a blocked coronary artery. However, he appeared in good form this week as he fulfilled several engagements on the Isle of Wight, off the south coast of England. The queen and the Duke of Edinburgh also gave a garden party at Balmoral Castle last week. Philip's next scheduled public appearance is alongside the queen as she opens the London 2012 Paralympic Games on August 29. He appeared by her side at the opening ceremony for the Olympic Games at the end of July and accompanied her on a visit to the Olympic Park as the events got under way. It has been a particularly busy year for the queen and Duke of Edinburgh because of the many events held to celebrate her diamond jubilee. Addressing Parliament in March, the queen paid tribute to her husband as ""a constant strength and guide"" throughout her long reign. The longest-serving consort in British history, Philip married then-Princess Elizabeth in November 1947 at Westminster Abbey. Born the prince of Greece and Denmark on the Greek island of Corfu in 1921, Philip left Greece with his family when he was 18 months old after King Constantine was forced to abdicate the throne following a revolution. The family moved to Paris and then to England in 1928. Philip also went to school in Germany. Philip renounced his Greek title when he became a naturalized British subject in 1947.","NEW: Prince Philip is responding well to treatment for a bladder infection, palace officials say .

"(CNN) -- Just two months after an engine cracked and failed during test aboard a Boeing 787, federal plane inspectors have found a second engine problem on a different Dreamliner, the National Transportation Safety Board announced. The NTSB identified the problem as a cracked fan midshaft on a Dreamliner General Electric GEnx-1B turbofan engine, the group said in a written statement posted on its website Thursday. The 787 had not yet flown when investigators identified the engine problem, investigators said. Inspectors uncovered the cracked second engine during an inspection of all in-service engines of that type, the NTSB said. The statement included no further details of the discovery. The NTSB, which investigates all U.S. civil aviation accidents, said its investigation of the engine troubles is continuing. GEnx engines are manufactured at a General Electric facility in Cincinnati. Related: U.S. domestic 787 flights to start in November . The first Dreamliner engine problem occurred on July 28 during a taxi test at Charleston International Airport in South Carolina. No passengers were on board, and no injuries were reported, although burning debris from the failure did cause a small brush fire near the tarmac. Related: Ethiopian Airlines brings 787 to Africa . In a third related development, a similar General Electric engine on a different kind of aircraft -- a GEnx-2B on a Boeing 747 -- lost power during takeoff last September 11 at Shanghai Pudong International Airport. That incident is under investigation by the Civil Aviation Administration of China, the NTSB said. Preliminary findings showed that the failed engine's fan midshaft on the 747 was ""intact and showed no indications of cracking,"" the NTSB said. The Federal Aviation Administration, General Electric and Boeing are involved in the Chinese investigation. Boeing rolled out the 787 Dreamliner last year, three years late and billions of dollars over budget.

"(CNN) -- Livestock producers suffering through one of the most severe droughts in decades will most likely have to wait until Congress returns from its August recess before getting any new federal disaster assistance. A Senate Democratic leadership aide tells CNN that the Senate is ""unlikely"" to take up an aid bill that the House plans to pass Thursday before lawmakers dash out of town for a five-week break. The aide said the Senate can't accept the House bill because there are too many differences between it and an-already approved Senate measure, both in terms of who is covered and how the cost of the aid is offset. The drought assistance was part of a broader five-year farm policy bill that got bogged down in the regional and partisan politics of the House, despite major efforts in recent weeks to pass it. But with mounting pressure from drought-stricken livestock producers, the House decided at the last minute to extend disaster aid just for them before leaving town. The House bill would help cover the cost of livestock loses and the high cost of feed because of the drought. With bipartisan support earlier this summer, the Senate passed its own five-year farm bill that includes disaster assistance for livestock farmers and ranchers. The Senate has pushed the House to pass its own bill so the two versions could be quickly reconciled and the disaster assistance could once again be available. Livestock producers are in a different predicament than other farmers because in the last five-year farm bill, the livestock portion was extended for only four years and has now expired. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, warned Tuesday that if the House wanted quick Senate action on that aid, it should pass the Senate's version of it. ""I think that what the House should do is take the provisions we have in our bill that we sent to them, and if they want to do something about drought relief, send that to us,"" Reid said. But House Republicans decided Wednesday they would pass their own language and then leave it to the Senate. Republicans said Senate Democrats would suffer political consequences if they chose not to pass it.","Democratic leadership aide: Senate unlikely to take up relief bill before five-week recess .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A federal prosecutor formally declared Army biological researcher Bruce Ivins the sole person responsible for creating and mailing the bacterial spores that killed five people in the 2001 anthrax attacks. Officials said biodefense researcher Bruce E. Ivins, seen here in 2003, committed suicide. ""We believe, based on the evidence we collected, that we could prove his guilt to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt,"" Jeffrey Taylor, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, told reporters at a news conference Wednesday afternoon. Taylor presented an overview of the case against Ivins, 62, after the Justice Department released documents detailing the scientist's role in what Taylor called ""the worst act of bioterrorism in U.S. history."" The anthrax-laced letters sickened 15 and killed two Washington postal workers, a New York hospital worker, a National Enquirer photo editor in Florida and a 94-year-old woman in Connecticut. In a statement issued after the news conference, Ivins' lawyers continued to proclaim their client's innocence and said the government's documents and statements fell short of ""concrete evidence."" ""The government's press conference was an orchestrated dance of carefully worded statements, heaps of innuendo and a staggering lack of real evidence -- all contorted to create the illusion of guilt by Dr. Ivins,"" attorneys Paul Kemp and Thomas M. DeGonia said. Authorities took the unusual step of laying out the case to the public after FBI Director Robert Mueller earlier Wednesday briefed survivors and relatives of victims of the attacks on the investigation. Taylor said Ivins committed suicide last week as federal prosecutors prepared for a meeting with his lawyers to lay out the findings.  Watch Taylor outline the case against Ivins » . ""We were able to identify in early 2005 the genetically unique parent material of the anthrax spores used in the mailings,"" Taylor said. ""The parent material of the anthrax spores used in the attacks was a single flask of spores, known as RMR-1029, that was created and solely maintained by Dr. Ivins."" Ivins spent 28 years as a civilian microbiologist at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick, Maryland, where he was trying to develop a vaccine against anthrax. But Taylor said Ivins' deteriorating mental state was compounded by fears that his vaccine program was in jeopardy, leading him to create a ""murder weapon"" in the form of a flask of purified anthrax spores in his lab. ""Dr. Ivins was a troubled individual,"" Taylor said, referring to his documented history of mental illness. Ivins had been under ""significant stress in both his home and work life"" around the time of the attacks, an affidavit filed in support of a search warrant states. About two weeks after the attacks, one co-worker told a former colleague that ""Bruce has been an absolute manic basket case the last few days,"" the affidavit said. ""One theory is that, by launching these attacks, he creates a situation, a scenario, where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine,"" Taylor said. Investigators also traced the envelopes that contained the spore-laced letters to the Frederick, Maryland, area where Ivins lived, Taylor said. The handwritten letters bore a Trenton, New Jersey, postmark and the date ""9-11-01."" They ended with ""Death to America. Death to Israel. Allah is Great."" Ivins sent an e-mail to a colleague a few days before the attacks that contained similar language, writing that ""bin Laden terrorists for sure have anthrax and sarin gas"" and have ""just decreed death to all Jews and all Americans,"" according to the affidavit. Authorities began focusing on Ivins in 2007, but he was unable to give investigators an ""adequate explanation"" when questioned by authorities about the long hours he had spent at the lab around the time of the attacks, according to the affidavit, which also said Ivins tried to mislead FBI agents by giving them false samples of the bacteria from his lab for analysis. But Ivins' attorney said the search warrants and the affidavits used to support them could not be considered ""smoking guns."" ""The government would have the American people believe that after seven years and more than $15 million of taxpayer money, they have found the individual responsible for the heinous attacks of the fall of 2001,"" Kemp said. ""Nothing could be farther from the truth."" At the time of his death, Ivins was under a temporary restraining order sought by a social worker who had counseled him in private and group sessions. Just a few weeks before his death, Ivins had been hospitalized for psychiatric examination after threatening to kill co-workers, investigators ""and other individuals who had wronged him,"" and agents found body armor, three pistols and several boxes of ammunition in his home when they searched it, the affidavit states. Wednesday's announcement comes six years to the day after then-Attorney General John Ashcroft publicly declared another Fort Detrick scientist, Steven Hatfill, a ""person of interest"" in the attacks. Hatfill was not charged and sued over the matter, a case the government settled in June. His case has fueled skepticism about the allegations against Ivins, and experts in the field have disputed some details that have emerged from the investigation. Taylor said Ivins was one of few people at Fort Detrick who knew how to operate a lyophilizer, which converts wet anthrax into the kind of dry powder that was used in the attacks. But Richard Spertzel, a former colleague of Ivins at Fort Detrick, said no one working at a U.S. government lab could have produced such high-quality anthrax in secret.

"(CNN) -- Five German citizens were among six people killed Monday after a tourist bus crashed into a container truck and burst into flames on an expressway outside Beijing, Chinese state media reported. A Chinese person also died, and 14 other people were injured, in the crash on a road linking Beijing with Shanghai, the state news agency Xinhua reported, citing police authorities in Tianjin, a city about 100 kilometers (60 miles) southeast of the capital. The crash, in which the bus transporting German tourists rear-ended the container truck, occurred at 8:30 a.m. Monday, according to the Xinhua report. The Germans' tour group was organized by the Beijing-based China Youth Travel Service, it said. Road accidents are frequent in China, and traffic on the nation's roads had been particularly heavy over the weekend as people headed home for a weeklong national holiday. A photo carried by Xinhua showed the charred wreckage of the bus standing on the expressway Monday. The news agency said it was unclear how many people were on the bus, but that witnesses had reported seeing ""a few people"" escaping from the burning vehicle. The cause of the crash is under investigation, it said.","A bus carrying German tourists rear-ends a truck on a Beijing-Shanghai road .

"SPRINGFIELD, Virginia (CNN) -- Georgia Keightley strolled through the religion section at Barnes and Noble in Springfield, Virginia, on Monday searching for a last-minute Christmas gift. The Green Bible looks at the text through the lens of the environment. ""I'm looking for a book on [the Apostle] Paul for my husband,"" she said clutching a 15 percent off coupon and lamenting the limited selection. She would have had better luck if she had been looking for a new take on the Bible -- on the next rack in front of her were three shelves filled with Bibles of various shapes and designs. Keightley said she and her husband already have five copies of the Bible in their home. Consistently the best-selling book on the planet, publishers are constantly repackaging it to lure new audiences. Harper One in October released the Green Bible, looking at the Bible through the lens of the environment. In an effort to keep it true to its eco-conscious motif, it was printed in the United States on recycled paper with soy ink, and has a sustainable linen cover. ""It is still printed on paper though,"" conceded publisher Mark Tauber, who said a digital format would be greenest. Tauber said publishers were hoping to capitalize on the growing trend in Christian circles of eco-theology and creation care. The Green Bible is filled with essays from across the theological spectrum as a companion to the text. Former Archbishop Desmond Tutu wrote the forward while Brian McLaren, a popular progressive author and pastor, and N.T. Wright, the staunch conservative theologian, contributed essays. Anytime the text mentions something about the environment, the letters are printed in green, similar to how some Bibles print the words of Jesus in red. In the United States, where religion and politics have danced and intertwined into a sometimes unrecognizable amalgam, environmentalism has been viewed by many politically conservative evangelicals as a ""liberal issue."" Matthew Sleeth is the author of ""Serve God, Save the Planet"" and for years he has been trying to convince churches that environmentalism and creation care are theologically sound. Their attitude, he said, has changed rapidly in the past few years. ""Recently I went to Grace Fellowship, the largest church in Baltimore, [Maryland,] and the pastor introduced me and said, 'I used to be against this, but examined my heart and the Bible and came to the conclusion I was wrong.'"" Another Bible out in time for the holiday season is The Illuminated Bible. The glossy oversized magazine format could easily mingle on coffee tables with Italian Vogue and GQ. It takes the text of the New Testament from the Good News translation and mixes it with editorial photos. Pages following a verse from Mark's gospel referring to John the Baptist -- ""God said I will send my messenger ahead of you to open the way for you"" -- are adorned with pictures of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Angelina Jolie, Mother Teresa and Che Guevara to hammer home the point to a modern day audience. ""The text is our heritage even if you're not a believer. We are stuck with it. Let's know more about it,"" said Dag Soderber, the Swedish advertising executive who is behind the project. Soderber said his motives were philanthropic. Though not a practicing Christian, he said the more people who read the Bible, the more who will see what it is all about -- and that will generate more religious tolerance. Soderberg's first goal was to make the packaging like a glossy fashion magazine so it would be more accessible to a modern audience, making it, ""something you can find in a hair salon, something you can find anywhere,"" he said. The Illuminated Bible debuted last year in Stockholm, Sweden. When bookstores wouldn't carry it, Soderberg brought it to friends who owned fashion boutiques and design stores and said it flew off their shelves. There have been a few tweaks to the English language version. ""There were some pictures that were sexy here [in Sweden] that we took out because I don't want to make it more offensive than I have to."" Soderberg hopes to have an Old Testament version in stores in time for Easter. So how do such repackaged Bibles sell among the other versions filling stores' shelves?  A manger at Borders Bookstore in Springfield, Virginia, said the Green Bible is selling briskly. Georgia Keightley thinks that's a good thing. ""Anything that gets people to read the Bible is a good thing."" Mark Tauber from Harper One said, ""I've seen a statistic that the average American home has four to nine Bibles in their homes. There's always room for more Bibles. The industry has shown us that.""","Wide range of Bibles on the shelves this Christmas .

"Rome (CNN) -- The trial began Saturday for Pope Benedict XVI's former butler over the alleged leaking of hundreds of secret papers from the pope's personal apartment to an Italian journalist. The butler, Paolo Gabriele, could face a sentence of up to eight years in an Italian prison if convicted, although it is possible the pope could choose to pardon him. He is charged with aggravated theft. Gabriele did not enter a plea but has admitted leaking the papers to the Vatican prosecutor, according to Vatican statements. Vatican computer technician Claudio Sciarpelletti, who worked in the Vatican's secretariat of state, is also on trial, accused of complicity in the crime. If found guilty, he faces a shorter prison term of only a few months. The Gabriele case is thought to be the most significant ever heard in the Vatican City courthouse, which has handled mostly petty theft cases in the past. Corruption claims based on the leaked documents rocked the Catholic Church hierarchy and could even affect who becomes the next pope. Pope's butler leaked papers to shock 'corrupt' church . Saturday's initial session was held under closely controlled conditions, with only a handful of approved reporters allowed to attend. Those reporters later briefed other journalists on the proceedings. They had been made to hand over their own pens in exchange for Vatican-issue ones in case any contained concealed listening devices, the reporters said. They recounted that the three lay judges, led by Giuseppe Dalla Torre, heard that Vatican investigators had seized 82 boxes of various sizes of evidence from Gabriele's apartments in Vatican City and Castel Gondolfo, a small town near Rome. The investigators also confiscated a gold nugget and a check made out to Pope Benedict XVI for 100,000 euros from the University Catolica San Antonio di Guadalupe and an original version of Virgil's Aeneid from 1581, from his apartment in Vatican City. Clean shaven and dressed in a light gray suit, Gabriele appeared pale and largely expressionless during Saturday's session. None of his family attended. Gabriele's lawyer, Christiana Arru, filed several motions concerning the admissibility of evidence, including the results of a psychological exam conducted without the presence of his lawyer and footage gathered via a hidden camera. The court will hear from Gabriele himself in its next session, set for Tuesday next week. Other witnesses called in his case include the pope's personal secretary, Georg Gaenswein, an attendant to the pope, Cristina Cernetti, and several police officers involved in the investigation. Sciarpelletti was not present in court but was represented by his lawyer, Gianluca Benedetti, who declared his client's innocence. Benedetti said Sciarpelletti was not a close friend of Gabriele, to which the latter reportedly nodded his head in agreement. The presiding judge, Dalla Torre, agreed to a request from Benedetti that the two trials be separated. Opinion: Scandals block Vatican's message . The Vatican has previously said Gabriele cooperated with investigators and admits leaking the papers, which consisted of faxes, letters and memos, including some from a high-ranking church official expressing concerns about corruption within the Vatican. A prosecutor in the case said in a report last month that Gabriele acted out of a desire to combat ""evil and corruption everywhere in the Church."" ""I was certain that a shock ... would have been healthy to bring the church back onto the right track,"" Gabriele is quoted as saying by the prosecutor, Nicola Piccardi. The Vatican City State penal code for proceedings involving its citizens is based on the Italian penal code of the second half of the 19th century. Dalla Torre will lead the debate in the courthouse, located behind St. Peter's Basilica, and question the defendant directly. Prison terms handed down by the court are served in the Italian prison system, under an agreement between the Vatican City State and Italy. Gabriele was arrested in May, following a top-level Vatican investigation into how the pope's private documents appeared in the best-selling book ""Sua Santita"" (""His Holiness""), by Italian journalist Gianluigi Nuzzi. The Vatican called the publication of his book ""criminal"" when it was released in Italian. Journalist Barbie Nadeau contributed to this report.","NEW: Paolo Gabriele did not enter a plea Saturday to an aggravated theft charge .

"(CNN) -- The key to understanding the tragedy that was Jonestown lies in the oratory skills of the Peoples Temple founder, Jim Jones. ""He was very charismatic,"" Leslie Wagner-Wilson, a Jonestown survivor, says of the Rev. Jim Jones. With the cadence and fervor of a Baptist preacher, the charm and folksiness of a country storyteller and the zeal and fury of a maniacal dictator, Jones exhorted his followers to a fever pitch, audiotapes recovered from Jonestown reveal. As he spoke, they applauded, shouted, cheered. One follower who survived the ""revolutionary suicide"" at Jonestown on November 18, 1978, said that Jones was the most dynamic speaker he had ever heard. Like all powerful speakers, Jones' greatest asset was his ability to determine what listeners wanted to hear and give it to them in simple language that appealed to them on an almost instinctual level. ""He was very charismatic, very charismatic,"" said Leslie Wilson, who survived that fateful day in Jonestown by walking away from the settlement before the cyanide that killed more than 900 Peoples Temple members was distributed. She was one of 33 people who began the day in Jonestown and lived to tell the tale. ""He could quote scripture and turn around and preach socialism,"" she said. ""He appealed to anyone on any level at any time.""  Hear Jones declare ""I am God"" » . Many of his followers were elderly African-Americans drawn to his cause by his soulful delivery and Pentecostal preaching style, including at times speaking in tongues. That hair-raising fervor was perhaps only overshadowed by what he said. ""When I say, I am God, then I feel [faith] well up within my soul. And I see it well up in you, and I see the sick healed, and the blind see, and the dead raised. ... You wanna know how I feel, I never feel so good as when I say I am God,"" he shouted in a full-throated roar in a 1972 sermon. Jones further enraptured crowds with faith healings -- laying hands on disabled or sick people who would miraculously be cured of any ailments. Though insiders later revealed that these healings were staged, Jones' mastery of word and presentation left few in attendance with any doubts about his abilities. He also indoctrinated many young, idealistic liberal white people in progressive 1970s California with the themes of socialism, equality and political activism. And he justified his brand of socialism with the Bible for those recruited from more conservative religious factions, who might have found such left-wing ideas tough to swallow. ""The only ethic by which we can lift mankind today is some form of socialism,"" he said in another 1972 sermon. ""There's a smattering of it in the, in the New Testament. It's very evidently clear on the day of Pentecost that they that believed were together and had all things common."" Socialism, he said, is ""older than the Bible by far."" But by the time Jones and many of his followers completed a lengthy relocation from California to Jonestown in Guyana in 1977, he had begun to change as a speaker. His trademark passionate delivery gave way to blind fury and incredible rage.  Listen to the rage of Jim Jones » . ""I been tired for 25 years,"" the 47-year-old Jones preached in 1978, his voice rising steadily in pitched anger. ""I'm tired of looking at people's faces that don't give a f--- for 25 years, I watch and they don't give a g------. You can lay it out in front of them, and they will not listen. They will not read. They will not do anything, and that's why I have to suffer every day and all night and all through the hours, because I will have nobody but a few that will carry the burden with me. Because you hide yourself away in ignorance."" His rages created a fear that cemented the hold he had on his followers. He also used a ""divide and conquer"" method among his followers. ""What Jones did was try to break all ties that were not to him,"" said former believer Vernon Gosney. ""Transfer all that loyalty, all that bonding to him. And so families were broken apart. Relationships were divided."" Such divisions caused family members to spy and report on one another, or friends to turn in friends for various transgressions. Jones furthered the poisonous atmosphere among his followers by encouraging physical fighting to either solve problems or administer punishment. Audiotapes of such sessions reveal Jones laughing, apparently entertained. Jones' mastery of the spoken word also enabled his many sexual exploits with both female and male followers. Jones deftly justified his actions to his followers by saying that what he did to them was actually for their own benefit, or the benefit of making the church a stronger, tighter-knit organization. He preached that many of his male followers were in denial about their homosexuality, conditioning those followers to accept him if he approached with a sexual advance. And he defused any accusations of sexual perversion on his part by claiming that he gained no personal pleasure from his acts, which he called a ""great sacrifice."" ""And if the leader is attracted to you, then somehow that cultivates,"" Jones said during a temple meeting in 1978. ""Well, you ought to know I'm attracted to you, I'm ready to die for every one of you, so that means I'm attracted to you. You follow what I'm saying? I'm attracted to all of you. How much more attraction can you have than to be ready to have your eyes plucked out?"" By the end at Jonestown, Jones was more rock star than preacher. His sermons and remarks at meetings were littered with obscenities. He regularly had sex with his followers and he abused drugs. By the last month of Jonestown's existence, Jones was so intoxicated at times that he had great difficulty even reading the news aloud to his followers. As the end drew near, Jones' tone as a speaker took darker turns. He constantly fed his followers in Guyana a steady diet of fatalism. ""I said, life is a f------ disease,"" he said. ""It's worse than cancer. It's a disease. And there's only one cure for the sonofabitchin' disease. That's death. And socialists can only take one form of death. What is it? Fight a goddamn war, or revolutionary suicide. If you don't believe life's a disease, then you're dumb. Very dumb."" Spurred on by their leader's talk, Peoples Temple members were ready to follow Jones even into death. At his request, they even wrote personal notes to him expressing their willingness to die for their cause.  Some followers willing to die » . This was the ultimate test of loyalty, and the absolute testimony to the power of his words. As history shows, Jim Jones the orator was chillingly effective.

"(CNN) -- The refining company Motiva has notified officials that an estimated 300,000 gallons of diesel spilled at its facility in Sewaren, New Jersey, when Superstorm Sandy pushed through, a U.S. Coast Guard spokesman said. Russell Tibbets of the Coast Guard told CNN on Wednesday the incident occurred when one tank ruptured. Most of the diesel was contained by a backup containment unit, he said. Earlier Wednesday, Shell, which owns part of Motiva, said at least two diesel storage tanks were damaged at Motiva's Sewaren terminal. It said the amount of the spill was unknown, but there were no further incidents. Sewaren is across from Staten Island. 'Jersey Shore' cast on Sandy devastation . ""Previously deployed booms are continuing to skim released product in the Woodbridge Creek adjacent to the site,"" Shell said in a statement. The Coast Guard is providing oversight of Motiva's cleanup, which includes the placement of containment booms, according to Tibbets. Vacuum trucks and about 100 workers will assist in the effort. The Coast Guard, Motiva and state officials will work to verify the spill amount, Tibbets said. Shell said terminals in New Jersey and New York had flooding because of the storm surge, as well as loss of power.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- He's the 20-something blogger who created the iconic Steve Jobs action figure. He's also the Hong Kong-based gadget fan who worked his supplier contacts in China to leak authentic components of the latest iPad before the official launch. And yet, despite his devotion to all things Apple, MIC Gadget's Chris Chang says if it came down to just one device -- he would choose a Chinese-branded smartphone over the iPhone. ""I like spending less money to get a similar performance from the iPhone 5 or Samsung Galaxy series,"" says Chang. ""The China-branded smartphone is my choice."" Chang shows me his preferred smartphone -- the roughly $400 OPPO Finder. The Android-powered phone is just 6.65 millimeters thin -- thinner than the iPhone 5. That said, it's not a 4G handset. But it's enough for Chang and a growing number of discerning Chinese smartphone users. China is forecast to overtake the U.S. in smartphone shipments and become the world's leading smartphone market this year, according to research group IDC. Break it down by marketshare and, according to IHS iSuppli Research, in the first half of 2012, three of the top five smartphones sold in China are local Chinese brands: Lenovo, Coolpad and Huawei. All three individually outsell Apple's iPhone in China. The mainland China smartphone market has been partly fueled by the demand for lower-cost handsets. In China, a 16GB iPhone 4S sells for RMB4,488 ($712). Traditionally, Huawei and Coolpad have been selling to the lower-end of the market, below RMB1000 ($160). But China's Meizu, Xiaomi and OPPO are climbing up the value chain -- not so high as to angle for the top tier of the market with Apple and Samsung, but right in the middle. ""Meizu, OPPO and Xiaomi are poised to differentiate themselves as strong mid-range smartphones, like a sedan,"" says Josh Ong, China Editor of The Next Web. ""At RMB 1,999 ($317), the (Xiaomi) Mi-Two will be 'good enough' for millions of consumers who aren't willing to spring for the more expensive devices."" Meizu was formerly the coveted smartphone brand in China, but that mantle has passed on to Xiaomi which -- like Apple -- masterfully markets its technology like a lifestyle. Xiaomi is the smartphone cult hero in China with its intensely loyal fans who adore the company's charismatic founder, Lei Jun, and the brand's distinctive style. Bottom line -- in China today, it's cool to have a Xiaomi phone. ""Watching a thousand Xiaomi fans give Lei and the new phone a standing ovation last month really drove home the company's success at connecting with its customers,"" says Ong. So how can the rest of the world get their hands on a cult Chinese smartphone? Well, you can't. They're only available in China. Xiaomi may have an English language Twitter feed, but it didn't want to lend its Mi-Two phone for review to international audiences on CNN's News Stream. (We had to borrow the phone from Chris Chang.) Meizu has an English language Website, but there's no option provided to buy the phone. There is, however, a retail store outside the mainland... in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong. The fan base for China's sleekest smartphones will remain in China for now.","Analyst: China is set to surpass the U.S. this year as the top smartphone market .

"(CNN) -- The chairman of the Republican National Committee said he was ""appalled"" by a song called ""Barack the Magic Negro"" on a CD distributed by one of his political rivals. Republican National Committee Chairman Mike Duncan is first party member to criticize ""Barack the Magic Negro."" ""The 2008 election was a wake-up call for Republicans to reach out and bring more people into our party,"" RNC Chairman Mike Duncan said in a statement reported Saturday afternoon by Politico. ""I am shocked and appalled that anyone would think this is appropriate, as it clearly does not move us in the right direction."" Chip Saltsman sent RNC members the parody CD ""We Hate the USA"" for Christmas, which includes the controversial tune. He defended his decision Friday, telling CNN the song was clearly intended as a joke.  Watch the controversy over the song » . ""I think most people recognize political satire when they see it,"" Saltsman told CNN. ""I think RNC members understand that."" Saltsman, a former chair of the Tennessee Republican Party, was a top advisor to former Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist and managed former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee's presidential campaign. He is one of several candidates running to replace Duncan in the closely contested race to lead the Republican Party. The song, set to the tune of the 1960s pop hit ""Puff the Magic Dragon,"" was first played on Rush Limbaugh's radio show in 2007. Its title was drawn from a Los Angeles Times column that suggested Obama appealed to those who feel guilty about the nation's history of mistreatment of African-Americans. Saltsman said the song, penned by long-time friend Paul Shanklin, should be easily recognized as satire directed at the Times. The CD includes parody songs referencing former Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards and the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, among other targets. Also Saturday, Peter Yarrow, who co-wrote ""Puff the Magic Dragon,"" called Saltsman's decision to distribute the parody tune ""offensive,"" and ""shocking and saddening in the extreme."" ""It is almost unimaginable to me,"" Yarrow wrote in a statement sent to CNN, that Saltsman ""would seriously be considered for the top post of the Republican National Committee. Puff, himself, if asked, would certainly agree.""

True, they just bowed their new single, ''New York,'' on ""Grey's."" But with their sixth full-length, ""Fallen Empires,"" Snow Patrol are hoping to make an emotional impact that resonates beyond the realm of McSteamy, if that's all right with McYou. With its sweeping guitar-rock symphonies and pounding electronic beats, ""Empires"" could've been called ""Fourteen Songs About Fourteen Different Types of Melancholy."" Break-ups, childhood nostalgia, even the loneliness of air travel are covered. The album begins with brooding over a house that burned down and only gets more dramatic from there, with enough slow-building uplift to make Coldplay paint little Day-Glo hearts on their jackets. The band's massive hooks have been boosted by Michael Stipe of R.E.M., who helped frontman Gary Lightbody overcome writer's block, and moments like the gospel-choir chorus of ''This Isn't Everything You Are'' are genuinely affecting. At times, Lightbody can be too over-the-top, with declarations like ''I've crashed to earth/ But I've fallen for so long that it was just relief.'' He's better on ''Life-ning,'' on which he sticks to listing his basic needs: ''Ireland in the World Cup/Either North or South... This is all I ever wanted from life.''

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Two explosions have struck a small cafe in volatile northwestern Pakistan, killing six people, including two police officers, local police and an official said. A paramedic treats a victim of a suicide blast at a hospital in Dera Ismail Khan on Sunday. The attack happened Sunday evening in the town of Dera Ismail Khan in Pakistan's North West Frontier Province, a frequent scene of suicide attacks. No one was killed in the first blast, which happened at a cafe near a local college, said Haji Abdul Rauf, the town's mayor. Four residents and two police officers were killed and 20 others injured when a suicide bomber struck 10 minutes later, Rauf said. The attackers were targeting police by attracting a crowd with the first blast, the mayor said. A local journalist said two of the civilians killed were reporters who had arrived after the first explosion. Pakistan's forces have been battling Taliban and al Qaeda militants in the North West Frontier Province and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. Some of the Taliban militants conducting attacks in neighboring Afghanistan have been based in the North West Frontier Province and nearby tribal regions. The resurgence of the Taliban has prompted U.S. commanders and the incoming Barack Obama administration to put more of a focus on confronting militants along the border. The attack on Sunday came one week after a suicide car bomber -- apparently targeting people voting to fill a national assembly seat -- killed at least 37 people and wounded 16 others in the Bunair district of North West Frontier Province. In November, a suicide bomber detonated his explosives in the midst of a funeral procession in Dera Ismail Khan, killing at least seven people and injuring 30 more, police said. Days earlier, a suicide bomber struck a mosque during evening prayers in the Bajaur region of the North West Frontier Province, killing seven people.

"(CNN) -- When disaster strikes, it seems someone has to take the blame. Writing to a colleague in 1879, British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli expressed his fear that another bad harvest would lead to his political party losing the general election. True enough, after a fifth poor crop season, Disraeli's party lost office the following year. Democracy has moved on since then, and it's hard to imagine that an event like Superstorm Sandy would have much of a bearing on who will be sitting in the White House come January. But studies show natural disasters can still have an impact on how people vote. More: Will Superstorm Sandy impact U.S. election? Political scientists found that while incumbent politicians can be punished at the polls following a natural disaster, voters are much more likely to turn against leaders if they are seen to have botched the response effort. But voters' instincts to punish leaders for bad events is ""more than made up for if they receive aid and adequate help,"" according to John T. Gasper of the Carnegie Mellon University, who carried out the study, published in the American Journal of Political Science in 2011, with Andrew Reeves of Boston University. Leaders also have a better chance of being re-elected for having been seen to do a good job rebuilding after a disaster. More: World weighs in on U.S. election . In 1965, Hurricane Betsy killed 75 people in the New Orleans area, just as the city was due to elect a mayor. The incumbent mayor Victor Shiro was able to boost his public image in the aftermath of the storm. With his shirt sleeves rolled up, joining in for the clean-up operation and flying into Washington to campaign for more funds, he showed himself to be a powerful leader prepared to help his people. He subsequently won the election, holding office for another five years. The social and political context in which a natural disaster happens can have far-reaching political implications, according to Professor Mark Pelling of King's College London in a 2008 study on the politics of disasters. He says President Barack Obama and his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, could gain from Hurricane Sandy at this crucial time in the election cycle. Pelling told CNN: ""So long as they roll up their shirt-sleeves and are seen to be personally involved in the reconstruction, it will normally be very good for [a politician's] popularity."" More: How to look presidential during a disaster . Recalling the criticism aimed at George W. Bush's handling of Hurricane Katrina, Pelling says that because Bush took several days to get down to the site of the disaster in New Orleans he was accused of being ""too arm's length"" in his response to the storm. Pelling and Kathleen Dill studied the impact of natural disasters on political action around the world, and found that leaders in both democratic and authoritarian regimes will try to manipulate the recovery process after a disaster to boost their popularity. A 1985 earthquake in Mexico City that left roughly 10,000 dead was also viewed as a contributing factor in the ruling party losing its 70-year hold on the capital city. Many of the opposition members had entered politics after being key activists in the reconstruction effort. Ten years later on the other side of the world, the Indian ""Onion Crisis"" played a crucial part in the losses of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the 1998 Delhi election, according to a 2012 study conducted by researchers at Harvard Business School and Loyola Marymount University. New Jersey's Christie: I won't play politics with Sandy . The price of onions -- a staple crop of the Indian economy and staple ingredient of the Indian household -- skyrocketed after several seasons of drought. While voters didn't blame the government for the drought itself, the study reports, they did hold them accountable for the perceived poor handling of the crisis and hit back at the polls. In China, Mao's successor Hua Guofeng was so buoyed by popular approval after the 1976 Tangshan earthquake that he took power from the leading Communist Party faction the ""Gang of Four."" Visiting the affected areas and expressing his sorrows to victims, Hua capitalized on the disaster and used it to help him successfully dismantle the political elite which had seen the country through the decade-long Cultural Revolution. The sense of camaraderie and positive feeling that is associated with the clean-up period following a disaster, when local services and community groups are out in force, usually lasts for around a week, according to Pelling. In this sense, the timing would seem to benefit Obama. More: Get latest news at CNN Election HQ . Gasper says Superstorm Sandy's proximity to election day makes its impact more unpredictable - and that the fortunes of Romney and Obama are likely to be swayed more by how they are seen to respond to the crisis than by the realities of the situation. ""It's a great PR event to show your constituents that you are there to help them,"" he told CNN. Though neither candidate wants to be seen playing politics with this storm, if there's any advice for Obama and Romney in their final week, it's surely: roll your sleeves up and smile for the camera.","Studies show natural disaster can impact how people vote .

"(CNN) -- Federal officers charged with keeping terrorists off planes are now searching their own ranks for staff who told CNN that few flights were protected by air marshals. Iraq war veteran Jeff Denning says a TSA investigator called him trying to find out if he spoke to CNN. The Transportation Security Administration rejected as a ""myth"" CNN's report that less than 1 percent of the nation's daily flights carry armed federal air marshals. Now the agency is conducting an investigation into who talked to CNN and who encouraged other agents to do the same. A spokesman for the TSA confirmed the investigation. Spokesman Christopher White said a TSA investigator is looking into the ""possible unauthorized release of sensitive and classified information to the news media by covered parties."" ""As part of this ongoing investigation, several individuals, both current and former employees, have been contacted as is typical in any investigation,"" he said in an e-mail to CNN. CNN spoke to more than a dozen current and former air marshals, pilots and federal law enforcement officials for the report, which aired in March on ""Anderson Cooper 360º."" Repeatedly, the sources told CNN that as few as 280 of an estimated 28,000 daily flights had armed federal air marshals aboard. That amounts to less than 1 percent. ""That number is absolutely wrong,"" said Kip Hawley, the head of the agency. He was speaking earlier this year before Congress, which held hearings into the Federal Air Marshal Service (FAMS) in the wake of CNN's reporting. CNN learned of the TSA investigation from a former federal air marshal and Iraq war veteran, Jeff Denning. He was not connected to the original story. Denning said he was called by TSA investigator Greg Neiderer a few days after he came back from the front lines of Iraq. Denning said Neiderer grilled him on an e-mail he received on his personal account while he was in Iraq. The e-mail discussed plans to expose corruption in the air marshal service. The e-mail encouraged recipients to contact CNN correspondent Drew Griffin if they had information about the hiring of airport screeners as air marshals, the elimination of mandatory psychiatric tests for new hires and managers lying to Congress.  Read the e-mail » . CNN only recently received a copy of the e-mail. CNN did not have it when the report aired in March. Denning said he forwarded the e-mail to current and former air marshals. Denning said Neiderer wanted to know who sent him the e-mail. Nothing in the e-mail contained sensitive security information, Denning said, nor did it encourage anyone to disclose information that could endanger the public. ""I was petrified,"" Denning said of Neiderer's phone call, explaining how he contacted CNN full of dismay that the TSA was harassing him and his family to find out which of his former colleagues had talked to the media. ""In Iraq, there were a lot of dangerous things, but never have I been so scared [as] when the federal government called me on my home phone and said I want to know about your personal e-mail account and what you have been sending."" TSA's Hawley refused repeated requests to be interviewed by CNN. Neiderer did not return repeated calls or e-mails. In an e-mail, TSA spokesman White confirmed Neiderer's involvement, but denied that the TSA or the Federal Air Marshal Service had accessed anyone's private e-mail accounts, via subpoena or otherwise. However, he added that ""all e-mails sent to government employees on a government system are always eligible to be read and reviewed as is outlined on every computer in TSA, including the FAMS."" White did not say how much the investigation is costing taxpayers or how long it would last. With a few phone calls, CNN was able to find the author of the original e-mail. The author is an air marshal who asked that his identity be concealed for fear of retribution by the TSA. The marshal said he sent the e-mail because for six years, his colleagues have been trying to alert Congress about continuing problems in the air marshal service. Many have left, he said, because of low morale and complaints about management. A May 2008 report from the Department of Homeland Security Office of the Inspector General said that the agency ""currently experiences a 17% voluntary attrition rate and low employee morale."" ""Congress doesn't want to hear it,"" the marshal said. ""They stick their heads in the sand. We tell them about the corruption. We give them examples and proof and I think they are scared of what they see. And they don't want to deal with it."" The marshal said he had done nothing wrong by sending an e-mail. ""The only thing in my e-mail was my telling these other air marshals that CNN was willing to expose the corruption in the federal air marshal services and Mr. Griffin's e-mail address,"" he said. ""That's not sensitive security information. That's freedom of speech."" He said he sent another e-mail urging air marshals to contact members of Congress investigating the air marshal service. Meanwhile, the air marshal service is undergoing a management change. Shortly after CNN aired its first report, director Dana Brown announced plans to retire. He has since decided to stay with the air marshals in a newly created position of Integrity Officer. His successor is Robert Bray, current deputy director, who, like Brown and Neiderer, is a former Secret Service employee. According to the TSA, Brown's job is to ensure that ""disciplinary measures and other personnel actions are administered uniformly throughout the organization."" Former air marshal Denning said he thinks the TSA should spend its time tracking down terrorists instead of former employees' e-mails. ""If they want to tap into someone's personal e-mail because they were going to destroy the Pentagon or kill the president, I could see reasons for contacting someone,"" Denning said. ""But they're contacting me on my personal e-mail that I apparently forwarded to someone else's personal e-mail account. It's outlandish."" CNN's Todd Schwarzschild contributed to this report.","TSA questions former air marshal about e-mail encouraging him to talk to CNN .

"(CNN) -- There may be no bigger revolutionary rock star than Aung San Suu Kyi. So it only makes sense that the 67-year-old Myanmar democracy activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner would tour the United States in a way reflecting that. On Tuesday, Suu Kyi was photographed laughing with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The two sat on couches next to each other at the State Department in Clinton's private office and chatted. Clinton told Suu Kyi about the bucolic scenes she could expect to see when she went to southern part of the U.S. ""You're going out to one of the horse farms. Those are beautiful places. They're called bluegrass the way it looks across the field,"" Clinton said to a smiling Suu Kyi. ""You'll find that quite beautiful."" That scene, historic and high profile, was just Day One of the next 17 days on Suu Kyi's calendar on her first visit to America. She's slated to talk with high-level Washington officials and democracy activists in the capital. The White House said she will meet with President Obama at 5 p.m. Wednesday, a day she's already expected to receive the Congressional Gold Medal. Then it's on to New York to speak at a university and at a museum. Next week, she'll be a guest of the U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell in Kentucky and visit California. It's a lot of travel for a person who spent most of the past 20 years under house arrest imposed by her country's ruling military junta. During her confinement, she lost her husband to cancer -- unable to see him because he was forbidden from entering Myanmar to be with her. She also went without seeing her two sons. Suu Kyi was released from detention in November 2010 and this year was finally able to pick up the Nobel Peace Prize she won in 1991 but couldn't receive in person. Profile: Suu Kyi, peaceful freedom fighter . Suu Kyi is expected to meet with refugees who left Myanmar (also known as Burma) and relocated in the United States, many who fought for the same democratic freedoms that she paid for so dearly. ""We have this plan throughout the country that when refugees come we try and find sponsors,"" Clinton told Suu Kyi on Tuesday. ""I'm looking forward to visiting Fort Wayne,"" Suu Kyi replied. ""There's all sorts of interesting things happening in Fort Wayne."" As part of Suu Kyi's U.S. tour, she will visit the Indiana city, home to one the United States' largest populations of Burmese expatriots. Since the early 1990s, some 5,000 Burmese have carved out a life in its ""Burmatown."" And many there are expecting a lot from Suu Kyi. ""We are excited for Suu Kyi in Fort Wayne, but we also hope that it is more that a single visit. We want it to mean more. She symbolizes experience for us and Burma in the long term,"" said Minn Myint Nan Tin, the executive director of the Burmese Advocacy Center in Fort Wayne, which helps refugees find jobs and navigate everyday life. ""The young people here want to be part of the Burma of tomorrow. This tomorrow is one that is open and free,"" said Nan Tin. ""We know that more has to happen outside of her."" Nan Tin fled Myanmar in the 1990s, she said. She and many of the Burmese who she works avidly follow world events. ""We always keep up on what is happening, and we are very aware of what has happened in the past few years about Suu Kyi,"" she said. Thawing U.S.-Myanmar relations . Last year, Clinton met with Suu Kyi in Yangon, the Myanmar capital. The two were photographed embracing, even though such signs of affection are not normally acceptable in the nation. The meeting was a sign that relations between Myanmar and the United States were softening. It had been icy for some time. Clinton was the first secretary of state to visit Myanmar in 50 years. In January, Suu Kyi announced she was running for Parliament. She won in a landslide in April. Suu Kyi is now the leading the pro-democracy opposition in her country. Myanmar's president, Thein Sein, who took control in April 2011, will visit the United States next week to attend the United Nations General Assembly's annual gathering of world leaders in New York. This week at least 58 political detainees were among hundreds released in Myanmar as part of an amnesty announced on Monday, a prisoner rights group said. Earlier this summer, the country removed Suu Kyi's two sons' names from a blacklist. On the world scene, Suu Kyi is both a politician and a symbol of promise, said Robert Lieberman, a filmmaker who interviewed Suu Kyi in Myanmar and had spent a lot of time in the country. His film ""They Call It Myanmar"" will be shown in New York and Los Angeles and other cities, including Fort Wayne on September 23. See a nationwide screening schedule . ""It's important to keep in mind what's motivating Sein. He wants an easing of sanctions against his country,"" said Lieberman. ""(Suu Kyi) is walking a tightrope."" He said Suu Kyi now must concede as much as any politician to get something accomplished, but she must also stand firm in her beliefs, the ideals that kept her sane and focused during her years in detention and have elevated her as a moral leader to much of the world. In July, the Obama administration began allowing U.S. companies to invest in Burma. Several lawmakers have voiced their support for a relaxation of sanctions. In May, Republican Sen. John McCain said Washington should temporarily lift economic sanctions but keep in place an arms embargo against the Burmese military and those who have violated human rights, according to Foreign Policy. Next generation's obstacles . Lieberman cautioned against what he views as overly optimistic headlines lauding Suu Kyi's U.S. visit as a harbinger of immediate change on the ground in Myanmar. He said that kind of change cannot come solely from the president or Suu Kyi. It's important to keep in mind that the military still has a tremendous amount of control, at least according to the nation's constitution. It still guarantees the military 25 percent of the legislature, he pointed out. ""Suu Kyi is stunning, strong, articulate, mesmerizing. But she is also 67. She'll be 70 when the next national election comes around in 2015,"" he said. ""So that's a factor as well. I think it will come down to whether a younger generation will get behind what she stands for, and will they be able to follow through."" And in that, he said, there's perhaps another obstacle. It's cultural. Lieberman wonders if young people -- especially those in her own party -- will challenge Suu Kyi honestly and directly when they disagree with her. ""There's something called 'anade' in Burma there which means you respect your elders, you don't give them a bad message,"" he said. ""I asked her, 'How do you get information?' And she said, 'Everybody knows they can tell me what they want and they won't get (fired).' ""She probably believes that,"" he said. ""But I just doubt it because there's such love for her, I don't see someone questioning her."" Nan Tin, in Fort Wayne, said she hopes they will. ""We have to be able to say what we think. The people have high expectations,"" she said. If Nan Tin has a few moments with Suu Kyi, she will use the opportunity not to demand anything, though. ""We know she is only one person,"" she said. ""I would tell her that we are with her, no matter what.""","Burmese democracy activist started her tour of the U.S. Tuesday .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- For the second time in less than two weeks, a prominent Pakistani is offering a six-figure bounty to anyone who kills the man who produced ""Innocence of Muslims,"" a film that has offended many Muslims throughout the world. Former Pakistani lawmaker Ikramullah Shahid told demonstrators protesting the movie in Peshawar on Monday that he'd pay $200,000 to anyone who kills the filmmaker, according to Siraj Ul Haq, a senior leader of the religious group that organized the rally. Read more: Pakistani minister personally offers reward for anti-Islam filmmaker's death . More than 15,000 protestors participated in a peaceful protest, Haroon Khan, a senior Peshawar police official, told CNN. Nine days ago, current Pakistani Railway Minister Ghulam Ahmad Bilour personally offered a $100,000 reward to anyone who would kill the filmmaker. Bilour clarified to CNN he was speaking for himself and not as a government representative. After he posed the initial bounty, Bilour was asked whether he was concerned about committing or condoning a crime as a government official. ""I am a Muslim first, then a government representative,"" Bilour said. Read more: Producer of anti-Islam film arrested, ordered held without bail . He said he invited the Taliban and al Qaeda to carry out the assassination. Sen. Zahid Khan, a spokesman for Bilour's political party, said the minister's action is not representative of the Awami National Party. ""We believe in nonviolence. How could we make such announcements?"" Khan said. ""Our party has been fighting against militancy and extremism for years. How could we invite Taliban and al Qaeda to kill someone? Taliban and al Qaeda are our enemies who have killed our loved ones."" Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf also condemned the bounty issued by Bilour, according to his spokesman. Neither of the prominent Pakistanis offering bounties mentioned the filmmaker by name. U.S. officials say Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, an Egyptian-American Coptic Christian, is behind the privately produced film. Nakoula was arrested last week in California and accused of violating his probation on a bank fraud conviction. He was ordered held without bail Thursday. Photos: Anti-U.S. demonstrations worldwide . Members of his family have left their California home and gone into hiding amid the at-times violent worldwide protests, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department has said.

In Russia on Monday, in the latest in a series of legal moves, Moscow's Tverskoi Court declared the film ""extremist,"" according to state media RIA Novosti. Russian courts expect to reach a full ruling on the movie this Friday, RIA Novosti reports.

"(CNN) -- The building where a gunman killed five people at Northern Illinois University two weeks ago will be demolished, state officials said Wednesday. Police tape and flowers sit outside Cole Hall at Northern Illinois University on Sunday. Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich's office confirmed that the state will provide the funding for the university to demolish Cole Hall, the site of Steven Kazmierczak's February 14 rampage. Cole Hall will be replaced by a high-tech classroom building to be named Memorial Hall, the office said. Kazmierczak, of Champaign, Illinois, opened fire on a geology class, shooting 21 people before killing himself. He used a shotgun hidden in a guitar case and three handguns hidden under a coat, NIU Police Chief Donald Grady said. Grady said he didn't know how many shots had been fired, but he said investigators recovered 48 bullet casings and six shotgun shells. About 160 students were registered for the class that met in the large lecture hall. Kevin McEnery said he was in the classroom when the gunman, dressed in a black shirt, dark pants and black hat, burst in carrying a shotgun. ""He just kicked the door open, just started shooting,"" McEnery said. ""All I really heard was just people screaming, yelling 'get out.' ... Close to 30 shots were fired."" Student Zach Seward said, ""We were having lecture as normal, a PowerPoint presentation. All of a sudden, the side door on the stage opens. Average-height male Caucasian comes out, draws a shotgun, pumps it and fires the first round on the first couple of rows. ""After that, everybody ducked down, started screaming, going toward the door. On the way out, I heard shots still being fired. Everybody was screaming and running out of the room. It was chaos.""  See map of where the shootings happened » . Kazmierczak's girlfriend told CNN that the 27-year-old had stopped taking an antidepressant three weeks before the shooting. Jessica Baty said Kazmierczak had been taking Xanax, used to treat anxiety, and Ambien, a sleep agent, as well as the antidepressant Prozac. Baty did not say whether Kazmierczak stopped taking Prozac abruptly or whether he consulted with his psychiatrist before doing so. She said Kazmierczak had been taking the antidepressant for obsessive-compulsive tendencies and anxiety caused by school. Baty told CNN that, during their two-year courtship, she had never seen him display violent tendencies, and she expressed bewilderment over the cause of the rampage. ""He was anything but a monster,"" Baty said. ""He was probably the nicest, most caring person ever."" ""There were no red flags,"" said Grady, the university police chief. ""He was an outstanding student; he was an awarded student; he was someone that was revered by the faculty, staff and students alike. ... So we had no indications at all."" NIU President John Peters said the gunman was a former graduate student who had a good record as an undergraduate, receiving a degree in sociology at the school in 2006. ""There's no indication that there was any trouble,"" Peters said. All the victims were from Illinois. The DeKalb County coroner's office identified four of them: Daniel Parmenter, 20, of Westchester; Catalina Garcia, 20, of Cicero; Ryanne Mace, 19, of Carpentersville; and Julianna Gehant, 32, of Meriden. The fifth victim, Gayle Dubowski, 20, of Carol Stream, died at a hospital in Rockford and was identified by Winnebago County authorities.  Read about the victims' lives » . Though authorities said they responded within seconds to the incident, they also vowed to see what might have been done better.

"(CNN) -- The new president of Egypt, Mohamed Morsy, is a 9-11 truther who doubts that America is telling the whole story about the collapse of the World Trade Center. He believes that a Christian or a woman should not be Egypt's leader. The ascent of his Muslim Brotherhood has been widely compared to Ayatollah Khomeini's rise to power in Iran, including most recently by Republican nominees Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan. Egyptians recently breached the walls of the U.S. Embassy in Cairo, immediately calling to mind the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis. Watching Morsy take to the podium at the U.N. General Assembly Wednesday for his first major address on the world stage, Americans could be forgiven for worrying that another anti-Western firebrand had just assumed power in Egypt, the Arab world's most populous country and its political bellwether. With his scruffy beard and his frequent references to Islamic values, Morsy bore a superficial resemblance to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who had just wrapped up one of his tirades minutes earlier. But Morsy is no Ahmadinejad, as their two very different speeches made clear. Since Morsy took office in late June, he has emerged as a strong, politically savvy leader who has put the country's powerful military and security services in their place. Opinion: Politics by mob in China and Mideast . In his address Wednesday, Morsy vowed to work for a Palestinian state and defend Islam against ""obscenities"" such as the film ""Innocence of Muslims,"" the YouTube clip that kicked off the recent riots across the Muslim world. But he also affirmed that Egypt would abide by its international obligations, including the peace agreement with Israel, and urged an end to the slaughter in Syria. Hardly the stuff of a wide-eyed radical. Morsy might yet prove to be the anti-American Islamist ideologue that some of his rhetoric suggests, but one all-important factor suggests that he will have to rein in his worst impulses. Egypt's economy is heavily dependent on tourism and foreign investment, and Morsy knows that he will be judged primarily on how he delivers for a population still reeling from the economic fallout of the revolution. At Tuesday's appearance at the Clinton Global Initiative, Morsy didn't blather on about evil Zionists and banning bikinis. Instead, he asked for money. ""We need assistance -- investment, technology, international cooperation,"" Morsy told his host, former President Bill Clinton. That's not the kind of thing you say if you're looking to shut out the world, Iran-style. In his interview with The New York Times -- his first with any paper since becoming president -- Morsy signaled that relations with the new Egypt would be more complicated than the days when American leaders could simply call up Mubarak and make demands. Egypt is a budding democracy, and the United States will have to take its people's views into account. Morsy's argument -- that ""successive American administrations essentially purchased, with American taxpayer money, the dislike, if not the hatred, of the peoples of the region"" by supporting dictators and Israel -- was merely a statement of fact backed up by poll after poll, not an anti-Western bromide. Many chuckled at his reference to the ""naked restaurants"" he disliked during his time as a Ph.D. student in California. But most Egyptians share his views about establishments such as Hooters, and plenty of Americans do, too. Some analysts worry that the Muslim Brotherhood will seek to impose Islamic law on Egypt in yet another comparison to Iran. But the country's constitution has long included a mild provision requiring that laws conform in spirit to sharia, and in a follow-up question-and-answer session, the Times' interviewers noted that Morsy had been quick to clarify that he did not support giving clerics a veto over the law. Morsy even ably handled questions about President Barack Obama's well-publicized remark that Egypt is not an ""ally,"" responding to CBS' Charlie Rose: ""This is dependent on the definition of an 'ally.' The understanding of an ally as a part of a military alliance, this is not existing right now, but if you mean by 'ally' a partnership and special diplomatic relationship and cooperation, we are that ally."" That sounds like a pretty clear-eyed description of reality to me. News: What to call Egypt's relationship with the U.S. Finally, the Egyptian military hasn't gone away, and it still gets the bulk of U.S. aid money -- more than $1 billion each year. Hundreds, if not thousands, of members of Egypt's officer corps have fond memories of their training in the United States. When I was briefly detained during last year's uprising, a young military police captain who had visited the Washington area waxed rhapsodic about the Tyson's Corner shopping mall and an all-you-can-eat crab feast he enjoyed at the Radisson. The ties between the two militaries have certainly been strained by the events of the past 18 months, but not altogether broken. Should Morsy begin to run roughshod over the constitution or take actions abroad that hurt U.S. interests, such as cozying up to Iran or aiding anti-Israeli groups such as Hamas, he will get pushback not only from his country's generals and the United States but also Egypt's allies in the Arab Gulf states, such as Saudi Arabia. Morsy knows well that if he crosses a red line with any of those partners, the economic growth he needs will be in jeopardy. What happens, though, if Morsy can't deliver improvement in Egyptians' daily lives? That's when we might see him turn to anti-American populism and religious rhetoric to mask his failures and to cover his right flank. In other words, Americans should indeed worry about Egypt, but they should worry most of all that Morsy will fail -- not that he will succeed. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Blake Hounshell.","Blake Hounshell: Morsy's views on 9-11, women and embassy breach worrisome .

"(CNN) -- The last prime minister to serve under ousted Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was referred to trial on corruption charges by an investigative judge, officials said. The charges against Ahmed Shafik, the runner-up in Egypt's presidential election, arise from allegations made against him while he served as the nation's civil aviation minister under Mubarak. ""He faces charges of profiteering and facilitating illegal acquisition of state funds,"" Adel Saeed, spokesman for the general prosecutor's office, said Sunday. Shafik was one of ten former civil aviation ministry officials referred to trial, Saeed said. Egyptian prosecutors have already ordered the arrest and extradition of Shafik in a separate corruption case involving the alleged illegal sale of real estate to Mubarak's sons. Shafik narrowly lost a June presidential runoff to Mohamed Morsy in what was Egypt's first election since Mubarak was ousted from office during a popular uprising in 2011. He left Egypt for the United Arab Emirates shortly after the vote, though his attorney told CNN at the time that Shafik was not fleeing the country but leaving out of concern for security. But Shafik on Sunday appeared to counter that claim. ""I traveled after the election in anticipation of unexpected persecution and that was proven to be true and a deliberate attack,"" he wrote in a post on Twitter. He accused his detractors of using the judiciary as part of a ""character assassination"" and vowed to stand up to what he described as a manipulation of the law. Shafik garnered international attention in the waning days of Mubarak's rule. Read more: Ahmed Shafik: Egypt's 'counter-revolutionary candidate' As Egyptians rose up in January 2011, Mubarak shuffled his government ministers in attempt to hold on to power and promoted Shafik from civil aviation minister to prime minister. Mubarak was toppled less than two weeks later, but Shafik remained in power for a few weeks longer, saying he and his government would report to the military council that took control of the country after Mubarak resigned. Shafik himself resigned on March 3, 2011, after a brief effort to keep Mubarak and his allies from being prosecuted following their ouster. Shafik has been the target of particular anger from the Muslim Brotherhood, the country's venerable Islamic opposition movement that backed Morsy. Ahead of the presidential election, the Muslim Brotherhood called for a mass protest in Cairo's Tahrir Square, the symbolic heart of the Egyptian revolution, against the candidacies of Shafik and Omar Suleiman, Mubarak's long-time head of intelligence. Both were disqualified from running, but Shafik successfully appealed against the ruling. Suleiman died in July.","An investigative judge has referred Ahmed Shafik to trial on charges of corruption .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Metallica's Lars Ulrich loves Black Sabbath and Deep Purple -- and so does his 10-year-old son. Actor Rodger Corser plays ""Guitar Hero"" at an April event in Australia. The game has revived interest in rock music. Ulrich may have played songs from those old rock bands around the house on his stereo, but he gives credit for his son's excitement to another source: video games. Myles Ulrich is a fan of games such as ""Guitar Hero"" and ""Rock Band,"" which have spawned a comeback for rock music. ""It's a cool generational thing to share that with your kids,"" said Ulrich, the drummer for the multi-platinum quartet. ""My [son's] favorite bands are ... the same bands that are my favorite bands -- the bands I grew up on."" A few years ago, rock music was struggling on the charts. With hip-hop and teen pop ruling, rock was finding it hard to break through with new music -- or sell more of the old. But ""Guitar Hero"" and ""Rock Band"" have prompted kids born in the '90s to discover artists from the '70s and '80s such as Aerosmith, Twisted Sister and Pat Benatar. The games' amazing popularity -- last year, the two brought in more than $935 million in revenue, according to the NPD Group market research company -- has helped create success in other markets, according to observers.  Watch Ulrich and others praise the games on ""American Morning"" » . Geoff Mayfield, senior analyst and director of charts for Billboard magazine, said he sees a direct cause-and-effect for some of the artists who have licensed their songs to ""Guitar Hero."" ""A few weeks ago, when the game featuring Aerosmith ['Guitar Hero: Aerosmith'] came out, there was more than a 40 percent increase in their catalog sales. I expect you'll see that again when Metallica gets the same kind of treatment in a few weeks,"" Mayfield said. iReport.com: Do you shred on ""Guitar Hero?"" Once wary of downloading, Metallica has changed its tune with its upcoming album. ""When 'Death Magnetic' comes out in September, you can actually download the new album the same day it comes out, and play it on your 'Guitar Hero III,' "" Ulrich said -- fully aware of the irony, given his band's past litigation with the Internet music file-sharing service Napster. Even in an uncertain economy, the video games also have increased interest in guitars, according to the nationwide Guitar Center chain. And bars holding ""Guitar Hero"" nights also have enjoyed a boost in business: Big Wangs sports tavern in Hollywood, California, reports a 25 percent to 35 percent increase in sales. The results have played out at such places as Roosevelt High School in Los Angeles, where most teens have grown up on a steady diet of hip-hop and R&B. Recently, heavy metal blared from the school's darkened auditorium as it sponsored a three-day ""Guitar Hero Face-Off."" Spotlights illuminated the competitors, and an audience full of enthusiasts screamed wildly at the end of each song. It was enough to make 16-year-old finalist George Gomez nervous. ""You got fans cheering you on,"" he marveled shyly. For Mayfield, the marriage of music and video games makes perfect sense, especially for an ailing record industry that's been having trouble selling CDs. ""This is a chance for something that's been a competition to actually be an ally, if you will,"" he said. Mayfield has never played ""Guitar Hero"" or ""Rock Band,"" but he said he understands the irresistible appeal of kids and adults indulging in some harmless headbanging -- albeit with toy instruments. ""If you've ever played air guitar, more than likely, you weren't doing it to a Michael Jackson song. You were doing it to an Aerosmith song,"" he said.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Firefighters, sailors and emergency workers reflected Friday on the scenes they witnessed during rescue efforts for the passengers of a US Airways jet that ditched into the Hudson River's frigid waters the day before. Divers plunge into the icy waters of the Hudson River on Thursday to rescue passengers from the ditched aircraft. It was far from just another day in New York, a city that has experienced its fair share of emergency calls. ""It was like a movie set,"" said Tom Sullivan of Firefighter Marine Company 1. ""We're at a Marine base, over a computer. Printout says 'Plane crash. Hudson River, over 15th Street.' "" Sullivan rushed to the scene and began working on transporting some of the 155 passengers on US Airways Flight 1549, many of them displaying signs of distress. ""I said 'Welcome to New York,' and a couple of them cracked a smile,"" he said. ""They were just glad to be warm and dry."" Detective Michael Delaney, the head diver for the NYPD Air-Rescue Unit, was lowered into the Hudson River from a helicopter in full scuba gear to rescue a woman hanging onto a floating object in the water. ""She seemed to be at the most distress at the time,"" Delaney said on CNN's ""Lou Dobbs Tonight."" ""They put us down to about 10, 15 feet off the water. And that's when we jumped into the water,"" Delaney said. ""Man, I've been in cold water, but nothing like that."" Darting speed boats and fighting strong currents was no easy job, said his partner, Detective Robert Rodriguez. ""Our first focus is to get a bit of communication established between us, kind of a game plan,"" Rodriguez said. ""It comes down sometimes to hand signals and a tap on the shoulder, a point of a finger."" The unidentified woman was reluctant to let go of the net she was holding on to but eventually wrapped her arms around her rescuers. She was later treated for hypothermia, Delaney said. ""If there's going to be a victim in the water, this is probably the worst time of year for them to be in the water,"" Delaney said. ""These people were literally in just regular clothes, obviously. They were just taking a flight on an airline and wearing a sweater, maybe some jeans, some sneakers."" Petty Officer Von Rankin recalled sailing alongside the airplane over icy waters to rescue passengers, some partially submerged in the near-freezing waters. ""I actually put my boat inside the plane,"" said Rankin, who was one of the first to arrive at the crash scene. Rankin and his crew, who plucked seven people out of the wreckage, praised the crews of the fast-moving swarm of commuter ferries that transported many of the passengers away from the sinking aircraft. Mike Starr, a ferry operations manager, credited a hammock-like maritime rescue tool called a Jason cradle with helping save passengers from the water as quickly as possible. While Starr was helping people out of the water, he quickly turned his attention to a mother attempting to climb into a raft with her infant. ""She climbed almost all the way up onto the boat,"" he said. ""She didn't have the strength, so we muscled her on. The baby was right back in her arms, and she was back inside real quick."" New York Waterways Capt. Brittany Catanzaro's daily work consists of ferrying commuters from New Jersey to New York's financial centers and basic ports. Rescue was a new mission to Cantazaro, who said freezing weather and the river's currents made the task more challenging. ""You had to maneuver the boat with the current, because the plane is going downriver,"" Catanzaro told CNN's ""Larry King Live."" ""And you had to make sure there was no one next to you or inside."" Other rescue workers who raced to save passengers also looked back on Thursday's rescue mission in disbelief. ""We heard it was a confirmed plane down. Initially, you think of a small Cessna-type plane, but when we got up on the scene, I saw the tail fin of a US Airways jet out of the water,"" New York firefighter Tom Sullivan said. ""It's unbelievable."" As Sullivan approached the partially submerged aircraft with passengers clustered on its wings, he was struck by the ""organized"" and ""calm"" atmosphere of the rescue efforts already underway. ""There's been helicopters that have gone down in the East River the last few years. But to handle this -- this is a large airliner with this many people, it worked out well. I was amazed that no one was killed.""","""I've been in cold water, but nothing like that,"" NYPD diver says .

"(CNN) -- Pirates hijacked three ships off the coast of Somalia on Thursday in the ""worst number of attacks"" in one day in many years, an international maritime watchdog said. An image of the Burum Ocean -- a suspected pirate mother  ship in the Gulf of Aden. ""Four attacks in two days, ships being hijacked and crews being taken, and large ransoms being demanded is completely unacceptable,"" said Capt. Pottengal Mukudan of the International Maritime Bureau, which monitors shipping crime. Pirates fired at a ship sailing under an Iranian flag and boarded it about 5:20 a.m. local time Thursday (10:20 p.m. ET Wednesday), said Noel Chong, head of the International Chamber of Commerce's Piracy Reporting Centre, a multinational coalition naval task force that monitors the region . They hijacked a ship operating under a Japanese flag a few minutes later, he said. A German ship was hijacked about 8 a.m. local time, Mukudan said. He said the pirates are still on board the German vessel, but he had few details. Pirate attacks are frequent in the waters off Somalia, a notoriously unsafe area for unescorted vessels. Canada announced this month that it was dispatching a warship to the area to protect U.N. aid ships after more than two dozen reported pirate attacks in the region this year. ""This is the worst number of attacks that we have seen in a short period of time for years,"" Mukudan said, calling on CTF-150 to ""give piracy a much higher priority to bring this under control. There have been seven vessels [hijacked] since the 20th of July."" Thursday's spate of attacks in the Gulf of Aden came two days after pirates boarded a Malaysian tanker off the coast of Somalia. They continue to hold it, Chong said. The IMB monitors shipping crime and reported Thursday's incidents to CTF-150, which is based in Djibouti, and the task force is ""monitoring the situation,"" Mukudan said. ""They have some of their vessels ,which are tracking some of these hijacked ships, but the problem is it's very difficult to take action once the hijackers are on board,"" he said. ""The lives of the hostages is at risk."" He said he understood that the task force was busy with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan but noted that the IMB would like to see the task force do more to respond to the problem before the hijackings occur. The IMB said in April that 49 pirate attacks on ships were reported in the first three months of 2008, compared with 41 for the same period last year. It recorded 263 pirates attacks last year, up from 239 the year before and the first increase in three years.

"(CNN) -- An avalanche at a ski resort in northeastern Turkey buried a group of hikers on Sunday, killing 10 of them, authorities said. Rescue efforts are continuing at the Turkish resort of Zigana, where 10 people have died. Rescue workers pulled seven survivors from the snow at the resort in Zigana, Turkey, according to Enver Salihoglu, the governor of the nearby city of Gumushane. At least two of the survivors were hospitalized, Salihoglu told CNN Turk. Rescue efforts were halted after all climbers were accounted for, according to a spokesperson for Salihoglu.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- New York Gov. David Paterson on Friday appointed relatively unknown U.S. Rep. Kirsten Gillibrand to replace Hillary Clinton in the U.S. Senate. Rep. Kirsten Gillibrand thanks Gov. David Paterson, right, after her appointment to the Senate on Friday. ""I believe I have found the best candidate to become the next U.S. senator from New York,"" Paterson said at a noontime news conference in Albany, New York. Gillibrand succeeds Clinton, who was sworn in Wednesday as secretary of state. ""I aspire to follow in her footsteps, knowing her shoes I can only hope to fill,"" Gillibrand said of Clinton. After weeks of speculation that the Senate seat would be filled by Caroline Kennedy, the office will instead go to a member of a lower-profile political family.  Watch who the contenders were » . Gillibrand comes from a well-connected clan: Her grandmother was a well-known political activist in Albany with whom Gillibrand campaigned as a girl. Her father is a lobbyist with ties to Republican former Gov. George Pataki. Her appointment to the Senate, effective Sunday, follows an apparently chaotic process that drew criticism from across the political spectrum. ""Kirsten is an intelligent and dedicated public servant and a dear friend,"" a statement from Clinton read. ""I'm pleased that this seat, which has been my great honor to hold, and which has in its history been held by leaders like former Sens. Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Robert F. Kennedy, will be in such capable hands."" President Obama praised Gillibrand, too. ""Kirsten has been a strong voice for transparency and reform in government and shares the belief that government should be open, accessible and work for all our citizens,"" Obama said in an official statement. Gillibrand, who will become the first upstate senator to represent New York since the late 1960s, is a stranger to most New Yorkers and a fresh face on Capitol Hill. She has served only one term in the House of Representatives, but her tough demeanor and upset win in a reliably Republican upstate district in 2006 immediately caught the attention of Democratic activists in a state known for hardball politics. While Gillibrand, 42, will represent one of the most progressive states in the country -- and has garnered solid union support and a 90 percent score from the American Civil Liberties Union -- the former antitrust lawyer and Clinton administration official is no dyed-in-the-wool liberal. The Albany-born Gillibrand currently represents New York's conservative 20th Congressional District. She's a member of the Blue Dog Coalition, a group of fiscally conservative Democrats. A supporter of gun rights, Gillibrand has been endorsed in her congressional runs by the National Rifle Association. She also supports an extension of the Bush tax cuts. The Catholic mother of two -- one of the few members of Congress to give birth while in office -- was an attorney before entering politics. She served as special counsel to then-Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Andrew Cuomo during the Clinton administration. Cuomo himself, now New York's attorney general, has consistently topped voter preference polls on the question of who should fill Clinton's Senate seat. Gillibrand's upstate district -- which starts in Dutchess county, at the northern fringe of the New York City suburbs -- shoots straight up the eastern side of the Hudson River, including Columbia and Rensselaer counties. It also includes Greene County, just west of the Hudson River in the northern Catskill region, and Delaware County, which is even farther to the west. The 20th Congressional District also includes Saratoga, Washington and Warren counties in the northern part of the state. It is home to Hyde Park, the one-time home of President Franklin Roosevelt. Gillibrand's seat was held by four-term Republican Rep. John Sweeney, and was considered safe for the GOP when she jumped into the race in 2006. But she ended up winning a brutal contest, 53 percent to 47 percent, and was overwhelmingly re-elected in November, 62 percent to 38 percent.","NEW: Clinton calls Kirsten Gillibrand ""an intelligent and dedicated public servant""

"(CNN) -- Manchester United were dealt a serious blow Tuesday as captain and key central defender Nemanja Vidic was ruled out for at least two months with a knee problem. The Serbian star missed the final five months of last season after rupturing his cruciate ligament and a fresh problem has emerged on the same knee. ""Nemanja Vidic has had a meniscus operation on his right knee and will be out for around eight weeks,"" read a statement on the club's official website. The new injury setback for the 31-year-old could not have come at a more unfavorable time for the English Premier League giants, who are also missing a number of key defenders ahead of vital league and Champions League clashes. England internationals Phil Jones and Chris Smalling are currently sidelined, the former with the same problem as Vidic, leaving manager Alex Ferguson with only two fit regular central defenders. That includes Jonny Evans, who picked up a minor injury in the 2-1 victory over Liverpool at Anfield Sunday which left United in second place in the early standings. United's neighbors and EPL champions Manchester City suffered a shock 4-2 home defeat Tuesday to Aston Villa in the English League Cup. City were twice ahead through Mario Balotelli and Aleksandar Kolarov, but two goals from Gabriel Agbonlahor, allied to an own goal from Gareth Barry and an extra time strike from Charles N'Zogbia saw Villa into the fourth round. Meanwhile, league leaders Chelsea continued their fine start to the domestic campaign with a thumping 6-0 home win over second-flight Wolves. John Terry, who quit the England captaincy just ahead of his FA hearing into charges that he made a racial slur in an EPL match last season, lined up for the match at Stamford Bridge. Gary Cahill put Chelsea ahead after just four minutes and it was one-way traffic throughout with Fernando Torres scoring in the second half and new Victor Moses rounding off the scoring.

"(CNN) -- Zimbabwe will introduce a $1 million note this week as the country tries to ease the effects of hyperinflation, the country's central bank said Monday. A money-changer in Mozambique holds Zimbabwean $10 million and $50 million bills in May. In August, the highest note in the once prosperous southern African country was Z$100 billion.  The country chopped off 10 zeroes, meaning the highest note was temporarily -- and briefly -- Z$10, until Zimbabwe started issuing bigger notes again. The current highest denomination bank note is Z$50,000, not enough to buy half a loaf of bread. Zimbabwe's currency continues to lose value as inflation gallops ahead. The official rate of inflation is 230 million percent, the world's highest, but independent analysts put the figure in billions. ""In the measures under way, the Reserve Bank [of Zimbabwe] plans to introduce a number of new, higher denominations; review the cash withdrawal limits, as well as commence aggressive campaigns for increased usage of alternative means of payment,"" bank governor Gideon Gono said in a statement. Gono said the RBZ intends to introduce Z$100,000, Z$500,000 and Z$1 million (about U.S.$8) bank notes in a bid to help consumers who are battling to make simple purchases and to ease cash shortages that have been prevailing for about two years. President Robert Mugabe's critics blame his policies for Zimbabwe's near decade of economic crisis. A power-sharing agreement between Mugabe and opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai that was signed in September has been deadlocked over a distribution of cabinet posts. The power-sharing deal is seen as the only hope to reverse the economic crisis. Meanwhile, the fight against a cholera outbreak in the capital city, Harare, seems to be faltering as more deaths are reported. Official statistics say 10 people have died since last week, but doctors say the disease has killed more than 30.

"New York (CNN) -- A cameraman who accompanied Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to New York for the U.N. General Assembly has applied for asylum in the United States, and ""he's afraid to return to Iran,"" his attorney said Monday. New York City-based lawyer Paul O'Dwyer, who said he is working with U.S. authorities on behalf of Hassan Golkanbhan, said his client is afraid of persecution because of his perceived political beliefs. ""He's perceived as not being a supporter, or being an opponent of the Iranian regime,"" O'Dwyer said. ""Somebody who has betrayed the regime and who can no longer be trusted by them."" O'Dwyer said while the cameraman didn't have any suspicion cast on him before his trip to New York, ""there were things that he was expected to do that he was uncomfortable with doing,"" and ""while he was here... his position on certain things became known to the Iranian government."" When Golkanbhan's part of the Iranian delegation returned home last Thursday after Ahmadinejad's addressed the General Assembly on Wednesday, the cameraman stayed behind, O'Dwyer said. Since then, O'Dwyer has filed an asylum application on Golkanbhan's behalf. The attorney says that filing provides his client immediate protection from deportation. O'Dwyer called it a ""very, very major decision,"" with implications for Golkanbhan's wife and two children, who have fled Iran for a haven he won't disclose for their safety. ""The Iranian govt has a fairly long reach, and you know, we're concerned about what may happen to them if they're identified by the government.""

"PARIS, France (CNN) -- A day of strikes dubbed ""Black Thursday"" in France looked more like ""Gray Thursday,"" with officials reporting a mixed impact across the country. Commuters wait for a train at a metro station in central Paris on ""Black Thursday."" Union officials said 2.5 million people demonstrated across the country, while the Ministry of the Interior put the number at one million. No arrests or violence were reported, Paris police said. In Paris, all but three lines of the Metro subway system were operating Thursday, the RATP transport authority said. Buses and trains were operating normally with only slight disruptions, the authority said. Suburban trains lines into and around Paris were badly hit. At best, only one in five was operating Thursday, operator RER said. Public transportation workers and other civil servants planned the 36-hour strike over a range of concerns spurred by the world economic crisis. Specifically, workers are anxious about a range of problems, including low salaries, poor buying power and job insecurity. Their collective strike action challenges the way the French government has handled the economic crisis. Unions complain that the government has spent billions to bail out banks and the auto industry while allowing little of that money to filter down to workers. Students, teachers and government workers were striking alongside transportation employees. Under a law introduced last year, schools are required to provide a ""minimum service"" to ensure that children with nowhere else to go during a strike may still be able to go to school. The law doesn't require that classes take place -- only that caretakers are provided. Paris municipal authorities said it was difficult for them to ensure a minimum service Thursday because they were not given enough notice for the strike. City officials said a total of 90,000 children in the capital would be affected in some way. The strike began at 8 p.m. (2 p.m. ET) Wednesday and is to end at 8 a.m. (2 a.m. ET) Friday. Union officials plan to meet Monday to consider future strikes, they said. Hospital and postal workers, bank staffers, air traffic controllers and auto workers also walked off the job. Air France said it was operating 100 percent of its long-haul flights. In Paris. the airline said it suspended 30 percent of its short- and medium-haul flights at Orly airport and 10 percent at Charles de Gaulle as a precaution during the strike. The national state-owned railway SNCF said traffic was normal on trains from Paris to other European capitals such as London and Zurich. It said the national high-speed TGV trains were running normally in eastern France, with traffic at 50 percent to 80 percent of normal levels in other parts of the country. -- CNN's Jim Bittermann and Sujatha Samy contributed to this report.","NEW: French unions say 2.5 million protested government handling of economy .

"(CNN) -- A French battleship sunk by German torpedoes in 1917 is lying upright and almost intact at the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea, where it was found by an unmanned submarine surveying a proposed gas pipeline route between Italy and Algeria. The Vergniaud is a French battleship of the same class as the Danton, which is on the floor of the Mediterranean. Details of the Danton's discovery were released at a news conference Thursday in Milan, Italy, where the pipeline construction company, Galsi, is based. The condition of the World War I-era ship is ""extraordinarily good,"" said Robert Hawkins, a project director with Fugro, a geotechnical, survey and geosciences company based in the Netherlands. ""It is actually on the seabed in an upright position so you can see the superstructure,"" he told CNN from England. The discovery was unexpected and caused considerable excitement, he said. Because Fugro was using an unmanned submarine to chart the seabed, it was not until later that its technicians realized they had found a large vessel. ""When we were processing the data, we discovered we had actually surveyed over this battleship,"" Hawkins said. The ship was found in December 2007, according to documents provided by Galsi. In January 2008, Fugro collected enough data to determine it was the wreck of a battleship. Subsequent discussions with the French Navy Commission confirmed the discovery was the Danton, which was built in Brest, France, in 1910. It was one of the largest French naval vessels of the era. The Danton was carrying 946 officers and sailors and 155 passengers on March 18, 1917, when it received a warning that enemy submarines were in the area. A lookout raised an alarm after seeing a wake in the water, but no vessel was seen before the Danton was hit by two torpedoes fired by the German submarine U-64. Most of those aboard were rescued, but 296 sailors -- including the captain -- went down with the ship. After the torpedoes hit, the ship turned upside down, then rolled again before landing on the seabed, where it slid before coming to its final resting place, Hawkins said. Although the ship lost some of its superstructure, for the most part it is relatively intact, he added. The French confirmed the identity of the Danton by comparing Fugro's data with design plans. Hawkins said he doubts the French will try to raise the ship because it lies nearly two-thirds of a mile (about 1,000 meters), under water. The ship is 472 feet (144 meters) long with four 305 mm 1906 guns in twin mounts; 12, 240 mm 1902 guns, also in twin mounts; and 16, 75 mm guns in single mounts, according to the ship's specs. It weighs nearly 18,000 tons. The Danton, which was traveling between Toulon, France, and Corfu, Greece, came to rest about 22 miles southwest of the island of Sardinia. The pipeline carrying natural gas from Algeria to Italy will be rerouted around the ship, the pipeline company said.","Torpedoes from a German submarine sunk the Danton on March 18, 1917 .

"(CNN) -- A possible merger between the two of the largest companies in the concert business has raised protests from singer Bruce Springsteen and prompted a congressman to call for a federal anti-trust investigation. A possible merger between Ticketmaster and Live Nation has drawn interest. Ticketmaster, which has long dominated ticket sales, is reportedly in merger talks with Live Nation, the world's largest concert promoter, which just recently began selling its own tickets. Live Nation did not respond to a CNN inquiry, while Ticketmaster's spokesman said ""we cannot comment on rumor or speculation."" ""Being two public companies, they can't really comment on it right now, but it seems very real to me,"" said Ray Waddell, Billboard magazine's concert tour reporter. iReport: What do you think of the possible merger? ""You're talking about a hugely powerful entity if these two combine forces,"" Waddell said. ""They're locking up a whole lot of the revenue streams for live music, and that is really the most consistent and profitable part of the music business right now."" Ticketmaster, long a target of fan and artist criticism, drew Springsteen's ire this week when it routed some of his fans trying to buy tickets to his show in New Jersey to a ""secondary site"" where they were charged far more than face value. Tickets on that site -- which Ticketmaster owns -- cost between $200 and $5,000, while face value starts at $54. Springsteen, in a message posted on his Web site, accused Ticketmaster of ""in effect 'scalping' "" the tickets. Ticketmaster CEO Irving Azoff apologized to Springsteen in a letter Wednesday, saying it wouldn't happen again. New Jersey Congressman Bill Pascrell, who said he was ""deluged this week by calls from angry music fans,"" sent a letter to the Federal Trade Commission chairman asking that the FTC look into Ticketmaster's practices. After reports that Ticketmaster and Live Nation might merge, Pascrell sent another letter to the House Judiciary Committee calling for a probe. ""There is an incredible potential for abuse when one company controls the primary and secondary market for concert tickets,"" Pascrell wrote. ""That potential will surely be magnified exponentially should one company be able to control every aspect of recording, record sales, licensing, venue ownership and ticket sales."" Springsteen's Web message asked his fans to ""make it known to your representatives"" if they opposed a merger. ""The one thing that would make the current ticket situation even worse for the fan than it is now would be Ticketmaster and Live Nation coming up with a single system, thereby returning us to a near monopoly situation in music ticketing,"" said the message, signed by Springsteen and his agent. Waddell, who has covered the friction between Ticketmaster, artists and fans, said combining the two companies could mean some fan-friendly changes, including rolling all fees into one ticket price to eliminate ""sticker shock"" when fans look at their credit card bill. Ticketmaster's practice of stacking ""convenience fees"" onto purchases inflated ticket prices and drew fan resentment. Ticketmaster pioneered online ticket sales, a modern convenience that did away with long lines at the box office. ""What Ticketmaster has done to ticketing, they've really revolutionized it as far as the old days, when you had to camp out for a high-demand show,"" Waddell said. Waddell said he doesn't expect ticket prices would ""just blow up"" after a merger. ""Traditionally, when there's competition taken out of the marketplace it really doesn't do a lot for lowering prices, but both these companies are very sensitive to the market and what the fans can pay,"" he said. A combined company, though, would control ""everything before, during and after a concert takes place over the course of an entire tour, and that's pretty sizable,"" he said.","Ticketmaster, Live Nation reportedly in merger talks .

"(Financial Times) -- The investigative journalist facing trial after embarrassing Greece's political and business elite by publishing the names of 2,000 Greeks with Swiss bank accounts on Monday stuck to his guns saying his list showed ""how sick the system is"". Speaking from his office in a run-down shopping mall in central Athens, Costas Vaxevanis claimed the list of accounts held by Greeks at an HSBC branch in Geneva encapsulated Greece's deeply corrupt political culture. ""It is a closed system with politicians, businessmen and their hangers-on controlling what happens,"" he told the Financial Times as the lights flickered on and off. ""We acted in the public interest ... We know the list is accurate. It refers both to legitimate accounts held by businesspeople and individuals and to others that we believe were used for channeling funds for purposes of tax evasion."" An Athens court postponed until Thursday Vaxevanis's trial for allegedly violating the country's data protection laws. The journalist's lawyers requested the delay at a preliminary hearing on Monday so that he could prepare his defence. Scores of friends and colleagues gathered outside the court to show support for Vaxevanis, editor of the biweekly Hot Doc magazine. If convicted, he faces up to five years' imprisonment. ""We will argue that there was no violation of privacy under Greek law as we didn't publish the amounts held in each account, only the names and professions of the account-holders,"" Vaxevanis said. Vaxevanis said that more than â‚¬13bn had moved through the accounts on the list between 1998 and 2007: ""Our view is that some account-holders moved large amounts of black money through their HSBC account in Geneva to invest in foreign funds or deposit in safe havens elsewhere."" The conservative-led coalition government has not commented on the case. One government official said on Monday it was ""being handled by the Greek justice system, and it has to be cleared up"". Shipowners, industrialists, artists and a handful of politicians and their relatives are among those named in the so-called ""Lagarde list"" published last week by Hot Doc. Sales of last week's issue quadrupled to 100,000, highlighting Greek anger over the failure of successive governments to crack down on tax evasion by the country's elite. The full list was also published as a special insert in Monday's edition of Ta Nea, Greece's biggest selling daily newspaper. Hot Doc's publication of the list provided in 2010 by Christine Lagarde, then French finance minister, to her Greek counterpart for investigation of possible tax evasion, has sent shockwaves through the country's political and business elite. Although members of the Greek establishment have long been known to transfer funds abroad, often in the names of their wives and other family members, it is the first time that large numbers of such account-holders have been publicly identified. The list was officially revealed last month though unofficial versions had circulated for more than two years. ""Our understanding is that politicians, media barons and some journalists were able to exploit the list for blackmail and extortion because the government held off from launching a proper investigation,"" Vaxevanis said, as a power outage briefly plunged his office into darkness. Several political figures whose names appeared on the list have issued formal denials. George Voulgarakis, a former public order minister, called it a fake, saying he and his family did not have any bank accounts outside Greece. Nikos Papandreou, brother of former premier George Papandreou, said there were plenty of other Greeks with the same name. Former finance minister Yannos Papantoniou said the appearance of his wife's name on the list did not correspond with reality. The French government obtained the list from Herve Falciani, a former HSBC employee who had illegally copied detail of 20,000 account-holders, including French, German and Italian as well as Greek citizens. Former finance minister George Papaconstantinou, who requested the list from Mrs Lagarde, and his successor Evangelos Venizelos face criticism for failing to ensure the financial police fully investigated the case. Both politicians told parliament last week that the CD containing the names and a copy made on a USB stick had been mislaid. Mr Venizelos later turned over a copy on a USB stick to the finance ministry, but Greece has since requested an official copy of the list from the French government because of doubts about its authenticity. Ioannis Kapeleris head of the financial police in 2010 told a public prosecutor he never received specific instructions to carry out a full investigation. Ioannis Diotis, his successor and a former public prosecutor, argued there were legal obstacles to pursuing the case. Mr Papaconstantinou said the records dated from 2007 and the total amount held by account-holders at that time stood at â‚¬1.5bn. © The Financial Times Limited 2012 .","Shipowners, industrialists, artists and a handful of politicians are among those named .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- William Jackson was a slave in the home of Confederate president Jefferson Davis during the Civil War. It turns out he was also a spy for the Union Army, providing key secrets to the North about the Confederacy. William Jackson, a slave, listened closely to Jefferson Davis' conversations and leaked them to the North. Jackson was Davis' house servant and personal coachman. He learned high-level details about Confederate battle plans and movements because Davis saw him as a ""piece of furniture"" -- not a human, according to Ken Dagler, author of ""Black Dispatches,"" which explores espionage by America's slaves. ""Because of his role as a menial servant, he simply was ignored,"" Dagler said.  ""So Jefferson Davis would hold conversations with military and Confederate civilian officials in his presence."" Dagler has written extensively on the issue for the CIA's Center for the Study of Intelligence .  Watch the stories of slaves as spies » . In late 1861, Jackson fled across enemy lines and was immediately debriefed by Union soldiers. Dagler said Jackson provided information about supply routes and military strategy. ""In Jackson's case, what he did was ... present some of the current issues that were affecting the Confederacy that you could not read about in the local press that was being passed back and forth across local lines. He actually had some feel for the issues of supply problems,"" Dagler said. Jackson and other slaves' heroic efforts have been a forgotten legacy of the war -- lost amid the nation's racially charged past and the heaps of information about the war's historic battles. But historians over the last few decades have been taking an interest in the sacrifice of  African-Americans during those war years. Jackson's espionage is mentioned in a letter from a general to Secretary of War Edwin Stanton. Maj. Gen. Irvin McDowell refers to ""Jeff Davis' coachman"" as the source of information about Confederate deployments.  Watch grandson of slaves: ""They call me Little Man"" » . Dagler said slaves who served as spies were able to collect incredibly detailed information, in large part because of their tradition of oral history. Because Southern laws prevented blacks from learning how to read and write, he said, the slave spies listened intently to minute details and memorized them. ""What the Union officers found very quickly with those who crossed the line ... was that if you talked to them, they remembered a great more in the way of details and specifics than the average person ... because again they relied totally on their memory as opposed to any written records,"" he said. Jackson wasn't the only spy. There were hundreds of them. In some cases, the slaves made it to the North, only to return to the South to risk being hanged. One Union general wrote that he counted on black spies in Tennessee because ""no white man had the pluck to do it."" No one was better than Robert Smalls, a slave who guided vital supply ships in and out of Charleston Harbor in South Carolina. He eventually escaped and provided the Union with ""a turning of the forces in Charleston Harbor,"" according to an annual report of the Navy secretary to President Lincoln. ""A debriefing of him gave ... the Union force there the entire fortification scheme for the interior harbor,"" Dagler said. One of the most iconic spies was Harriet Tubman, who ran the Underground Railroad, bringing slaves to the North. In 1863, she was asked by the Union to help with espionage in South Carolina. She picked former slaves from the region for an espionage ring and led many of the spy expeditions herself. ""The height of her intelligence involvement occurred late in 1863 when she actually led a raid into South Carolina,"" Dagler said. ""In addition to the destruction of millions of dollars of property, she brought out over 800 slaves back into freedom in the North."" As the nation marks Black History Month in February, Dagler said that history should include the sacrifices of the African-Americans who risked their lives for their nation. Many paid the ultimate sacrifice. ""They were all over the place, and no one [in the South] considered them to be of any value. Consequently, they heard and saw virtually everything done by their masters, who were the decision-makers,"" Dagler said. Whatever happened to William Jackson, the spy in Jefferson Davis's house? Unfortunately, that remains a great unknown. ""He simply disappeared from history, as so many of them have."" CNN's Wayne Drash contributed to this report.","William Jackson, a slave, learned key details inside the home of Jefferson Davis .

"DENVER, Colorado (CNN) -- Twenty alleged members of a Hispanic gang believed to be one of the nation's largest and most violent have been indicted in Colorado on drug and firearm charges, authorities said Tuesday. This grafitti in North Denver is the work of the gang MS-13, the Department of Justice says. Of the 20 alleged MS-13 members named in two indictments, eight were arrested Tuesday morning in Denver and in Los Angeles, California, authorities said. Another eight were already in custody, according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Colorado. Four remain at large, the office said. ""The arrests were the culmination of a three-year investigation into one of the most notorious street gangs in the country,"" the release said. Jeff Dorschner, spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office, said the indictments stemmed from a multiple-agency and multiple-state effort. Some of the defendants are accused of drug dealing activity that prosecutors said reached all the way into a California prison. In the course of the investigation, police seized 10 pounds of methamphetamine, 2.3 kilograms (5 pounds) of cocaine, a small amount of heroin, 12 firearms and $3,300 in cash, according to the release. Police said they believe the gang members ""conspired to distribute, and possessed with intent to distribute, quantities of methamphetamine, cocaine, heroin and marijuana,"" federal prosecutors said. ""The conspiracy, and other related drug distribution charges included the distribution of the illicit drugs on the streets of metro Denver, as well as in a facility in California called the High Desert State Prison."" Other defendants are charged with illegal firearm possession, authorities said. Nine defendants in addition to the 20 named in federal indictments are being prosecuted in Colorado state court, according to federal prosecutors. The defendants face maximum sentences of life in prison, depending on the offense, as well as fines up to $2 million, authorities said in the news release. MS-13 has long been regarded by law enforcement agencies as one of the deadliest gangs in the United States and beyond. It is estimated to have up to 50,000 members worldwide, about 10,000 of whom are believed to be active in at least 38 states, according to an attorney general's report to Congress on gangs in April 2008. In 2004, the FBI created a task force to focus on MS-13. Federal authorities have said that most MS-13 members are immigrants from El Salvador or the children of Salvadoran immigrants. The gang originated in Los Angeles, authorities have said, and it has spread across the United States and into Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.","Eight suspected MS-13 gang members arrested in Colorado and California .

"(CNN) -- The maker of peanut butter linked to a nationwide outbreak of salmonella shipped tainted product it knew had tested positive for the bacteria, the Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday. The Peanut Corporation of America found salmonella in its plant in Blakely, Georgia, the FDA said. The FDA report said the Peanut Corporation of America's own testing program found strains of salmonella 12 times in 2007 and 2008 at its Blakely, Georgia, plant. The problem does not appear to have been resolved. When FDA inspectors visited the plant this month, they reported finding still more salmonella contamination. According to the inspection report, posted on the FDA's Web site, the ""firm's own internal microbiological testing"" found salmonella in peanut paste, peanut butter, peanut meal, peanut granules and oil-roasted, salted peanuts.  Watch what violations occurred at the plant » . However, it added, ""After the firm retested the product and received a negative status, the product was shipped."" That's not the way it ought to have been handled, according to one expert. ""They were lab shopping,"" said Tommy Irvin, Georgia's agriculture commissioner. ""They were trying to find a way to clear their product, so they can ship their product out,"" he told CNN.  Learn more about food poisoning » . He said proper practices demand that if any food product tests positive for salmonella and another test comes back negative, ""you believe the one that is positive."" In a written statement, the company denied accusations it had been ""lab shopping"" to get a negative test result in order to ship the product. ""PCA uses only two highly reputable labs for product testing and they are widely used by the industry and employ good laboratory practices,"" the company said. ""PCA categorically denies any allegations that the company sought favorable results from any lab in order to ship its products."" But according to Irvin, once salmonella is found in a product, ""that lot should be destroyed, but [in this case it] wasn't."" The Georgia Department of Agriculture is working with the FDA on the investigation of the outbreak, which has been linked to the plant. ""The inspection also revealed no steps were taken in terms of cleaning or cross-contamination"" after the salmonella was found in the plant, said FDA's director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Dr. Stephen Sundlof. The company did not clean the production line after Salmonella Typhimurium, the bacterium implicated in the outbreak, was found there last September, according to the FDA report. This is the same type of bacteria found in 502 people who have become ill in 43 states and Canada since September. At least eight deaths have been linked to the outbreak. Violations also include contamination of plant surfaces and equipment by other microorganisms, the discovery of roaches near production and packaging areas and the inability of the company's ventilation system to prevent the salmonella from contaminating other parts of the plant. Sundlof said the reported problems indicate the plant deviated from the good manufacturing practices companies are supposed to follow. The FDA investigation began January 9, shortly after the manufacturer was implicated as a source of the outbreak. The plant produces peanut butter sold to institutions, such as nursing homes and cafeterias, as well as peanut paste, which is used in cookies, crackers, ice cream and pet treats.  Watch the salmonella outbreak that has sickened hundreds » . This month, Peanut Corporation of America began recalling peanut butter and paste produced since July 1.

"(CNN) -- Take a close look at the icon that Apple created for their new Maps app and you'll notice a few things. It points out the location of Apple headquarters at 1 Infinite Loop, but the red pin has been replaced by a blue line, one that leads away from their main building and suggests that you make a hard right through the median to jump onto the freeway. From a tactical point of view, in their growing fight against Google, rushing out a new map application made sense. But the app itself is clearly worse than the one it replaced, and an audience used to constant improvements and refinements isn't happy. Meticulous attention to detail, once the hallmark of the Apple brand, seems to have been pushed aside for corporate competition, leaving everybody wondering what's next. Maps is the most obvious misstep, but it isn't the only one Apple has made recently. There has been a trail of failures and dead ends the past few years that people don't talk nearly as much about. They include Mobile Me, Ping, Siri, Apple TV and the ongoing mess that is the desktop version of iTunes. And iCloud is clunky because it's about trying to change the way we work, whether we like it or not. So what happened, and what does it mean for the future of the most successful technology company of our lifetime? Opinion: Apple seems to have gotten a little bit lost . What Steve Jobs saw was that the true promise of technology was to combine software and hardware in a way that would create a rich user experience. Instead of giving users what they were asking for, he succeeded by constantly giving people things they didn't even know they wanted until they held it in their hands. Now everyone has come to expect a certain kind of perfection and showmanship from Apple that can only happen when you're revealing things that are so new and different that users find themselves gasping in surprise and delight. Apple has been able to do that for quite a while with a brilliant visionary at the helm. But having totally redefined the consumer electronics landscape, Apple now finds itself without a creative leader and caught in the expectations of its own success. As users become more comfortable with the devices they have, there's a justified sense of entitlement that the application they've come to rely on will continue to provide the functionality they've come to expect. To put it another way, discovering that there's no longer transit directions when you're looking to find the bus home is never a nice surprise. Despite some neat new features, the iOS 6 lacks any of the usual big ideas that take out the sting. Instead, the new operating system cleans up some dirty corners and puts on a fresh coat of digital paint to get ready for bigger changes down the road. But slow and steady won't win the race. When it comes to incremental steps, Google, Amazon and Microsoft are all experts at software that may not start out great, amazing or different but clearly improves through iteration. And Google is busy buying companies like Zagats and Frommers to quickly corner the market on rich, valuable data in a way that Apple will never be able to. Without the ability to launch a new platform as bold as the iPod, iPhone and iPad, it gets harder and harder for Apple to truly innovate. The problem isn't that Apple is failing to do what it has always done, it's that its ability to ""think different"" might go away. While Apple, under the guidance of Tim Cook, will continue to create its beautiful, crafted combination of hardware and software for at least another decade, that will no longer be enough to continue to take the risks they need to in order to wow the world the way they have since Steve Jobs showed us the iPod 11 years ago. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Andrew Mayer.","Andrew Mayer: The new Maps app on iPhone 5 is clearly worse than the old one .

"(CNN) -- Youths have rioted on the streets of Athens and other Greek cities for the past three days. Stores and cars have been torched, barricades erected and rioters have fought running battles with police. Athens riot police come under attack near the capital's main police station Sunday. The unrest came after police shot dead teenager Alexandros Grigoropoulos, 15, who they allege was about to throw a fuel-filled device at them, as a gang of youths pelted a patrol vehicle. What has been the political reaction to the unrest? The Greek government, led by Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis' center-right New Democracy party since 2004, has appealed for calm. Interior minister Prokopis Pavlopoulos and his deputy tendered their resignations, but this offer was rejected by Karamanlis. The government has been quick to condemn the death of Grigoropoulos in a bid to defuse the crisis. Two police officers have been arrested.  Watch youths riot in Greece » . ""An investigation is under way and those found responsible with be punished,"" said Pavlopoulos Sunday. ""Measures will also be taken to avoid such incidents again in the future."" Much of the violence have been blamed on self-styled anarchists -- although opposition parties have been quick to blame the Greek government for the crisis. The Communist party has announced that a rally will take place in Athens Monday.  See images of anarchy on Greek streets » . Is there a wider political context to the unrest?  Greece has endured a tumultuous 18 months. Karamanlis called a snap election in mid-2007 to back his proposals for reforming Greece's social and economic system, including the privatization of ailing public institutions such as Olympic Airlines. He has argued that such reforms are necessary if Greece is to compete with the rest of Europe and the wider world. Karamanlis assured workers -- one in five of whom lives below the poverty line according to government statistics -- that massive layoffs would not result from the reforms. What happened? Just weeks before the September election, forest fires ravaged much of Greece, leaving at least 70 people dead. Many blamed Greece's slow bureaucracy for not responding quickly enough to the disaster. For his part Karamanlis suggested that the blazes might have been set by political extremists ahead of the vote -- a claim that his left-wing rivals claimed was made to destabilize the nation. Karamanlis was re-elected for a second term -- but only by a slim majority. How have the reform plans fared? Not well. Union leaders -- who represent around half the Greek workforce to a union -- have argued that planned pensions reforms, which would end most forms of early retirement, fail to protect workers. ""It is unjust and unfair to all categories of workers, mainly working mothers and young people entering the labor force,"" Yiannis Panagopoulos, head of GSEE, one of the two main labor unions, said in March. The government has argued that such reforms are especially necessary, given how the nation's low birthrate will likely impose a burden on future generations. There have been several strikes during the past year that at various times have hit all transport networks, including international airports, schools, courts, banks, public offices, hospitals, utilities and media organizations. At times garbage has been left uncollected and homes and offices have suffered power blackouts. A demonstration in Athens during the latest general strike during October descended into skirmishes as protesters confronted police, who responded with tear gas. The worldwide financial crisis has hit Greece hard as well. The government has been forced to cut ambitious growth targets, despite a projected GDP growth of about 3 percent -- above fellow Eurozone nations. Flagging revenues have also forced the government to impose new taxes on capital gains and the self-employed, and also to bring forward plans for privatization. Is there a history of unrest in Greece? Greece gave the world the word and ideal ""democracy"" and has itself enjoyed a period of political stability since the mid 1970s. A member of NATO and the European Union, it became a parliamentary democracy in 1952 following civil unrest after the end of World War II. But a coup in 1967 saw the army take control, ban elections and institute a repressive right-wing junta that eventually abolished the monarchy in 1973. Civil unrest saw the overthrow of the regime and the introduction of a republic in 1975. Since then Greece has gradually sought to redefine and modernize its image, especially during the past decade, staging the Olympics in 2004 and attempting to forge stronger ties with Turkey, its traditional rival. But Greece has not been without civil strike beyond street demonstrations. For more than two decades the November 17 terror group carried out at least 25 murders against Greeks and other nationals, including the assassinations of U.S. CIA Athens chief Richard Welch in 1975 and British diplomat Brigadier Stephen Saunders in 2000. The remaining members of the group were eventually caught in 2002. What next for Greece?  Even if the street violence subsides, the political pressure on Karamanlis is unlikely to subside -- more so given how he has staked his name on economic reform. His administration survived a turbulent 2007 -- and 2008 has given Greece more of the same.","Greece has endured unrest with youths battling police on the streets .
Government has endured a rocky year as it tries to introduce economic reform .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court kicked off its new term on Monday, struggling to clarify when foreign victims of torture and other crimes against humanity can sue corporations and others in federal courts. The outcome could have significant global impact from a moral, political, and financial perspective. At issue is the scope of a federal law that is increasingly being used in an effort to hold parties accountable for human rights atrocities committed overseas. A dozen Nigerian political activists now living under asylum in the United States claim foreign oil companies were complicit in violent abuse at the hands of their former country's military. The decade-old lawsuits have been blocked from going to trial in American courts. The Obama administration is siding partly with the foreign businesses. Election raises stakes for court vacancies . The justices first heard the case in February, trying to sort out whether individuals alone -- or political groups and corporations also -- are covered by broad civil immunity for alleged international law abuses. Now the court will decide that and a more fundamental question: whether the 1789 federal law can be applied to any conduct committed entirely outside the United States. ""Do you disagree [there] are fair [international] judicial systems where a plaintiff can get a fair shake?"" said Justice Samuel Alito, reflecting general conservative skepticism. ""If that's so, then why does this case belong in the courts of the United States, when it has nothing to do with the United States other than the fact that a subsidiary of the defendant has a big operation here?"" But other justices said federal courts for two centuries were open to such foreign claims, initially in response to piracy on the high seas. ""We gave a stamp of approval"" to such lawsuits in a 1980 case, said Justice Elena Kagan, ""understanding that there were certain categories of offenders who were today's pirates."" Chief Justice John Roberts wasted little time before moving on to the first of two cases. The nine-member bench remains the same, and showed no signs of discord after the controversial, landmark ruling in late June upholding President Barack Obama's health care overhaul. Scalia dismisses talk of rancor . The human rights appeal was filed on behalf of residents of the oil-abundant Ogoni area of the Niger River delta. Two decades ago, they protested environmental harm caused by Shell and other energy firms from petroleum extraction. They and their families claim the Nigerian government brutally suppressed them, ""aided and abetted"" by private corporations doing business there. The Ogoni 9 -- as the key leaders became known -- were allegedly detained, tortured, and tried by a special Nigerian military tribunal, in violation of international human rights treaties. The Nigerian government's 1993-95 crackdown sparked global outrage after author Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other activists were convicted, then hanged. Among those bringing suit is his nephew, Charles Wiwa, who escaped the oppression and now lives in Chicago as a political refugee. He described being a student activist beaten by soldiers for hours in front of a crowd of onlookers, then detained and tortured for days. He claims Shell -- based in the Netherlands and Britain -- conspired with the government to keep its business operations going in the face of protests and should be held accountable for ignoring or encouraging a pattern of killings, rapes, beatings, and property destruction. He said the only place to obtain justice is in the United States. ""Nigeria's dictatorship has grown rich from its oil,"" Wawa told CNN. ""It is important those (oil) companies be held responsible, because we cannot bring any legal action in courts in Nigeria."" The U.S. law in question is the Alien Tort Statute, which gives federal courts jurisdiction over civil claims from foreigners that they were harmed by international law violations. It was largely ignored for decades, but has now become an important legal vehicle for those bringing human rights claims. Similar lawsuits involve Chevron and Exxon energy operations in Indonesia; Chiquita Brand fruit farms in Colombia; and businesses that operated years ago in the apartheid system in South Africa. Justices will soon take up same-sex marriage . The high court in 2004 endorsed use of the statute in question, but only in limited circumstances. Paul Hoffman, attorney for the Nigerians, said the United States was a proper judicial forum for such limited claims. ""The trend in the world today is towards universal justice for people and corporations that violate these kinds of norms,"" he told the court. ""In fact, the United States has been the leader in that. Our government has proclaimed our leadership position to U.N. bodies and around the world. All four left-leaning justices were skeptical about giving corporations a judicial free pass of sorts. When Kathleen Sullivan, attorney for the corporations, suggested prior court precedent did not deal with the current dispute, Sotomayor shook her head. ""You're basically saying [the prior cases] were all wrong,"" said Sotomayor. ""Counsel, how can you say that? Maybe the facts didn't, but certainly the reasoning of the case addressed that issue very directly, basically said it does"" give Nigerians a chance to make their case in U.S. courts. A ruling is expected in a few months. The case is Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum (10-1491).","Supreme Court begins new term with case involving foreign victims of torture .

"(CNN) -- ""You're disconnected from the whole entire world,"" says Gerri Holterhoff, after her mobile phone drops another call. After Superstorm Sandy walloped the East Coast on Monday night, more than 2 million New Jersey residents, such as 62-year-old Holterhoff of Ocean Township, were left without electricity, heat or cell phone service. Power has been restored to some households, but nearly 1.5 million customers are still in the dark statewide, and many neighborhoods have been left in disarray. The New Jersey coast saw the worst of the storm. In the town of Toms River and surrounding barrier islands, 200 people had to be pulled to safety from encroaching flood waters. Gov. Chris Christie said the damage along the Jersey Shore was ""unthinkable."" Opinion: Jersey Shore, I'll miss you . Located about four miles inland, the suburban community of Ocean Township wasn't spared. Though she hasn't had to contend with flooding, Holterhoff's neighborhood is a graveyard of broken tree branches, and no one has power for miles around. Since losing electricity, she has learned to be resourceful. She has no choice. For warm food, she has relied on the charcoal-fueled barbecue grill outside. ""As food was defrosting, I was taking it out and cooking it. Pot pies, toaster cakes -- anything we could do,"" she says. Meanwhile, she uses her car battery to charge her cell phone. ""Sometimes at night, I'm out there charging the phone and have a flashlight and am reading a book,"" she says. She's able to keep up with the news via radio --""the only connection to the outside world,"" she says -- with batteries that were a gift from neighbors. As temperatures begin to dip into the low 40s at night, she has taken to pacing the rooms of the house she shares with her husband and dog, wearing multiple layers and a hat and scarf to keep warm. Before the storm, she drove three miles to work. Since the storm, she drives, in gridlock and on back roads because of downed stoplights, to shop for ice, gas or food from one of two grocery stores that are open. She says lines at the gas station are backed up about two to three miles with cars. There's a separate line of people waiting with gas cans to fuel their generators. She must return to her house at 7 p.m. for curfew. On its website, Public Service Electric & Gas Co. (PSE&G) said it may take seven to 10 days to restore power to customers in the areas hit hardest, while Jersey Central Power & Light said the ""majority"" of customers will get their power back by next Wednesday. Marshes and malls: Migration to U.S. coast heightens impact of storms . ""It's eerie. It's very quiet and, as soon as it's dark, you see nothing, you hear nothing, there's nothing going on,"" she says. That sense has only been amplified for New Jersey residents as stories of looting and petty burglaries have started to circulate. ""We've had a 6 p.m. curfew since the storm and heard some alarming rumors about stores being robbed or armed break-ins by people pretending to be from PSE&G,"" said Ted A'Zary, of Bayonne. ""It was pretty scary on Wednesday when our phones weren't really connecting and we weren't sure we could even contact 911 if we had an emergency, but it has gotten better since then."" Other concerns are high-risk groups such as children, the elderly and the ill. A'Zary says local firefighters have been checking on older residents in the area to ensure that those in need are receiving aid. ""Our largest concern with the lack of heat has been caring for our toddler,"" said 41-year-old A'Zary. ""Violet is 17 months old and doesn't know how to sleep under a blanket yet. We've had her sleeping with a sweater over her pajamas inside a fleece SleepSack and are checking her to be sure she's warm enough after every nap and in the morning."" Brendan Ward, a 23-year-old Glen Rock resident, has also added a few layers of blankets since he lost power on Monday afternoon. ""You wake up and are glad it's light out. At night, it's dark and not pleasant,"" he says. For the first half of the week, Ward could not even leave his house, where he lives with his parents, because of downed trees and debris blocking his path. Now, he says, he's staying out of the house as much as possible. In the small town of about 11,000, he can walk to a few of the surrounding businesses that didn't lose power. ""I've gone out to eat every night of the week. I went to the same local pizza shop four nights in a row,"" he says. While Ward has been able to return to his home, some aren't so lucky: 6,922 people and 48 pets were being cared for in 104 shelters as of Friday, according to the New Jersey Office of Emergency Management. The residents we spoke to were sustaining themselves by eating food they'd stocked up before the storm or at local restaurants, but some who live in the state are receiving supplemental food from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. As of Friday afternoon, more than 596,000 liters of water and more than 199,000 meals have been transferred from staging bases in Westover, Massachusetts, and Lakehurst, New Jersey, to affected states to supplement their existing inventory, according to FEMA. Long gas lines test residents' patience . While FEMA is helping some, Matt Eckert of Hoboken, who has no power and a flooded basement, is getting by with a little help from his friends. During the day, he showers, charges his phone, eats and drinks at friends' homes with hot water and electricity. ""We've really come together as a community. We were all so lucky that our friends had power and, therefore, let us share the bounties of our freezers,"" says Eckert. ""Each night we gathered, drank (didn't want the beer to go warm) cooked and socialized before walking back through the dark streets to our own cold apartments."" On Thursday, Eckert's girlfriend's family cooked up a feast in the spirit of Thanksgiving, featuring a turkey that had been frozen since Easter and other food that was just going to go bad anyway. Despite his losses, Eckert realized he had a lot to be thankful for. ""Many of us were lucky in Hoboken to only have minimal damage,"" he said. ""There are some in town who were not as fortunate, and it is heartbreaking."" 7 health risks in the wake of Superstorm Sandy .

"(CNN) -- The owner of a Nebraska car dealership and two executives were in police custody facing theft charges Thursday after 81 cars were taken from the dealership's lot, authorities said. Alan Patch, 52, who owns Legacy Auto Sales in Nebraska is being held in Tooele County, Utah. Alan Patch, 52, the owner of Legacy Auto Sales in Scottsbluff, Nebraska, was being held in Tooele County, Utah, Scottsbluff police Capt. Kevin Spencer told CNN. Rachel Fait, 37, Legacy's comptroller, was arrested in Tooele County on Wednesday, and Legacy general manager Rick Covello, 53, turned himself in to Scottsbluff officials Thursday, Spencer said. Police became aware of the case Tuesday, when they received a call from Toyota company officials, Spencer said. Toyota told police they had received a call that all of Legacy's new Toyotas were gone from its lot. Employees arriving at the dealership for work on Tuesday also found the three executives gone, police said. They had packed up their personal possessions. Some computers were gone, as well. Fait and Patch's homes in Nebraska were on the market and empty, Spencer said. In all, authorities found, 81 vehicles -- mostly Toyotas but some Fords as well, valued at more than $2.5 million -- had been moved off Legacy's lot over the weekend and on Monday. At least some of them were moved by a Utah transport company that was paid with a fraudulent cashier's check, Spencer said. Authorities have been trying to track down the cars, he said. Seven of them were found at a Utah auto business; 16 others were sold at a Utah auction. Others were found in Las Vegas, Nevada, Spencer said, but police do not have an accurate tally of how many remain missing. The FBI has been assisting local authorities in the case from the beginning, Spencer said. The cars weren't the dealership's to sell free and clear. While they technically belonged to the dealership, they were financed by Toyota, he said. New cars come to dealerships with documentation called a Manufacturer's Statement of Origin. Police investigating the case found that those statements had been converted to titles, Spencer said. While such conversion is not a crime, and is not unheard of among dealerships, the step usually is seen when a dealership goes under and is trying to expedite the sale of vehicles, he said. What a dealer can do with cars depends on a dealership's agreement with the manufacturer, Spencer said. Police are attempting to find out details of Legacy's agreement with Toyota, he said, but ""normally as part of that agreement, [the cars] are not to leave the dealership."" ""We're of the opinion they've committed a crime,"" Spencer said. Arrest warrants for the three list each as facing one count of felony theft, he said. The dealership had been facing financial difficulties, Spencer said. The Scottsbluff Star-Herald reported a bank had been overseeing Legacy's day-to-day operations for about three months. According to the newspaper, the owner of a Utah auto auction said that some of the vehicles had been sold at his business, but he declined further comment, saying he was seeking legal advice because he was trying to work things out with Toyota. Doug Bergener, a manager at Bargain Buggys in Tooele, Utah, a suburb of Salt Lake City, told the newspaper he offered to buy 10 used vehicles from Legacy after hearing they were shutting down. But the vehicles that arrived were brand new, he said. He had sales pending on four before he got a call telling him not to sell them. He told the Star-Herald that he's known Patch and Fait for years, and that Patch told him he had paid for the vehicles and had titles. ""I don't think anyone can prove anything's illegal at this point,"" Bergener said, according to the Star-Herald. ""We've known Allen for 15 years and never knew him to do anything underhanded. There's been no reason not to trust him. He's always been honest. It'll all come out in the wash.""","Executives Alan Patch, Rachel Fait and Rick Covello arrested .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Clashes between Shiite militias left dozens of people dead and hundreds wounded in Karbala and Baghdad, prompting Shiite Muslim cleric Muqtada al-Sadr on Tuesday to call for calm, his spokesman said. Iraqi special forces patrol Karbala on Monday as thousands of Shiite pilgrims stream into the holy city. A curfew and weapons ban were in effect and Shiite pilgrims were evacuated from the southern Iraqi city of Karbala, where fighting has killed up to 50 people and wounded 247 others, the Iraqi Interior Ministry said. The Iraqi Army had taken control of the city by early Wednesday, Iraq's national security adviser said. ""The situation is quiet now, but nervous and tense,"" Mowaffaq al-Rubaie said in a phone call from Karbala. Referring to the clashes in Karbala and Baghdad, he said, ""They are potentially dangerous and can develop into something more serious."" The violence erupted Monday night in Karbala, where hundreds of thousands of pilgrims were attending a Shiite religious festival. The fighting spread to Baghdad on Tuesday.  Watch how the fighting began » . Five people were killed in Baghdad, where al-Sadr's followers torched six offices belonging to the Supreme Islamic Council of Iraq, authorities said. Al-Sadr has called for calm, banned further fighting and urged members of the Mehdi Army militia to guard the Islamic Council offices and officials, according to Sheikh Ahmed al-Shibani, a senior al-Sadr aide in Najaf.  Al-Sadr also called for an investigation into the clashes and for those behind the attacks to be punished, his spokesman said. The attacks were accompanied by fighting between the Badr Organization and the Mehdi Army. The Badr Organization, part of the Supreme Islamic Council of Iraq, has been incorporated into Iraqi security forces throughout the country. The Mehdi Army is the militia of al-Sadr. In Sadr City, where two of the political offices were burned, the Iraqi army called in reinforcements and air support while battling the Mehdi Army, an Interior Ministry official said. The Mehdi Army also set fire to the Dawa Party's office in Kadhimiya, an Interior Ministry official said. Prime Minister Nuri Al-Maliki is a member of the Dawa Party. Shiite pilgrims in Karbala were celebrating Sha'abaniya, the birthday of Imam al-Mehdi, the 12th Imam, whom Shiites revere. The celebrations were to peak Tuesday and Wednesday. The pilgrims in Karbala were evacuated from the city center, and a full curfew was imposed, said Brig. Gen. Abdul Kareem Khalaf, an Interior Ministry spokesman. There is also a ban on bicycles, motorbikes and pushcarts. A curfew also was in effect in nearby Najaf, a Shiite holy city to which many pilgrims fled after the Karbala fighting began, Najaf police said. The fighting was apparently spurred by a security measure that banned people from carrying weapons into Karbala, an Interior Ministry official said. The al-Sadr loyalists refused to give up their guns, leading to clashes between the Sadrist fighters and security forces protecting the shrines, an Interior Ministry official said. The Mehdi fighters have accused the security forces of being members of the Badr Organization. Pilgrims and members of the security forces are among the casualties. Local officials convened Tuesday to discuss how to defuse the situation. Tensions have been high between the armed wings of the major Shiite political movements. Targeted assassinations and battles between the Badr Organization and Mehdi Army have been prevalent in recent months. Other developments: . • A deputy oil minister and four other kidnapped employees of the Iraqi Oil Ministry were freed Tuesday after two weeks in captivity, the oil ministry said. The deputy oil minister, Abdul Jabber al-Wagga, and the four general managers are in good health and have returned home, the ministry said. • Several hundred U.S. and Iraqi troops converged on Iraq's Diyala province, killing 33 insurgents and restoring a city's water service, the U.S. military said. The troops carried out an air assault Monday in the Gobia community to restore water in nearby Khalis. The military said ""water is currently flowing unimpeded."" • A suicide bomber detonated an explosive vest Monday in the courtyard of a mosque in Falluja, killing 12 people, including an imam known for speaking out against Iraqi militants, an Interior Ministry official said. Two of his sons also were killed in the blast, according to the official. • Coalition forces ""killed eight terrorists and detained 11 suspected terrorists"" during raids targeting al Qaeda in Iraq leaders, the military said Tuesday. The raids, spanning two provinces northeast of Tikrit, targeted a senior-level adviser with links to international terrorist Khalid al-Turki, the military said. Al-Turki was killed during a June 23 operation. • A ""highly sought weapons facilitator"" was arrested Tuesday in Baghdad, the military said.

"(CNN) -- A missing University of Florida student's backpack was found at the residence of a suspect, whose car tested positive for blood, Gainesville police said Saturday. The developments came as authorities continued searching for Christian Aguilar, 18, last seen September 20. At a court hearing Saturday, a judge denied bail for Pedro Bravo, 18, charged with first-degree murder in Aguilar's apparent death. Aguilar's backpack was found hidden inside a suitcase in Bravo's closet, police spokesman Officer Ben Tobias said in a statement explaining what led authorities to charge Bravo with murder. Blood found in several locations in Bravo's vehicle will undergo an expedited analysis and be compared against known DNA samples of Aguilar, Tobias said. Bravo changed his account of what happened ""after being confronted with evidence that disputed his initial statements,"" Tobias said Saturday. Bravo had told investigators he got into ""an altercation with Aguilar"" the night the college student went missing, police said. The suspect then left Aguilar in a parking lot in the central Florida city, prompting police to warn that Aguilar may be disoriented and/or seriously injured. Aguilar's father told CNN affiliate WCJB that his son disappeared after a fight over a girl. After talking with police a day after his disappearance, Bravo was held for mental examination after threatening to harm or kill himself. He was later charged with depriving a victim of medical care, a third-degree felony, and was in custody at the time he was charged with murder, according to Tobias. Scientists have confirmed lime rock residue was found on Bravo's vehicle, police said Saturday. ""We believe that Christian Aguilar may be located near areas of lime rock,"" Tobias said. The police spokesman previously said, ""we would ... encourage property owners, residential or business, who may have lime rock roads on their property, that were accessible to the general public, to search those properties for any suspicious areas of ground that appear to have been disturbed,"" Tobias said. ""We are also requesting information from anyone who may have seen a suspicious vehicle, likened to a Blue Chevy Blazer, in any remote areas on the night of Thursday, September 20."" Authorities have used helicopters and K-9 units to search for Aguilar, to no avail. His relatives have plastered the area with fliers, taken to Twitter to generate leads and invited a nonprofit search group to help look for him alongside family members and police. Bravo's lawyer said his family initially volunteered to help in the search, only to be politely turned down by the victim's relatives. Gov. Rick Scott was to join the search Saturday in a wooded area in Gainesville, his office said.

"""Edward,"" ""Elizabeth"" and ""Chris"" are pseudonyms. CNN agreed to change the names to protect the family's privacy. Look for their story this weekend on CNN. Mother and son clutch hands, describing abuse by a man who said he attended a Florida reform school. MIAMI, Florida (CNN)  -- ""Elizabeth"" and ""Chris"" have never been to Marianna, Florida. But Marianna came to them -- and stayed. They say they lived with a man whose tortured past brought them a lifetime of pain. It goes back 50 years, to a man CNN is calling ""Edward,"" who claimed to his family that he attended a Florida reform school in Marianna in the early 1960's. Edward told his wife and son that he was regularly beaten and sexually abused and once was ordered by guards to shoot at classmates at the school. They say the school turned Edward into an angry, violent, alcoholic man who beat them in the same way that he was beaten as a child at the school. ""We were the ripple ... effect of their abuse on my husband, his abuse on us,"" Elizabeth said, her eyes brimming with tears. ""If they hadn't done to him what they did, he never would have done what he did to me, which shaped my whole life,"" she said. ""The way he felt so unloved, like he had been thrown away, the anger, the hurt all the time, the drinking,"" she explained. ""The abuse that we went through."" ""I'd like the people that did it to pay for it,"" Chris said. ""To be honest, I'd like to do it myself."" Through the years, they never believed Edward's story, but recent news reports that detailed claims of abuse at the reform school have made it easier, they say, to stop blaming themselves. ""I just kind of wrote it off as, he was looking for sympathy from me, for what he had done, and tried to explain it away to me so I wouldn't be mad,"" Elizabeth said. In December, Florida Gov. Charlie Crist ordered an investigation into recent allegations that more than 30 crosses on the school grounds might mark the remains of boys killed at the school during the 1950s and '60s. Former students, now in their 60s, have alleged that they were beaten and sexually abused. Some of their classmates suddenly disappeared, they said. Many of the victims believe that those missing students are buried under more than 30 white crosses on the reform school property. The state investigation is partly to determine who might be buried here. Elizabeth and Chris are part of the cycle of pain that may turn out to be the reform school's legacy. Elizabeth met Edward shortly after he left the Florida School for Boys. He was 15 then, still a bit of a rebel. ""He wore the leather coat ... and we just kind of clicked,"" Elizabeth said. ""He always seemed to be sad, and I just thought I could help him."" After they married -- she was 20 and Edward 22 -- the physical abuse began. He had a temper, she said, and one day he beat her and kicked her in the face. That's when Elizabeth heard her first story about the Florida School for Boys. Her husband told her about a time when a friend had to pluck out fabric from his underwear after it became embedded in his skin during a beating, she said. CNN has spoken to five men who attended the Florida School for Boys, and all of them tell similar stories of school administrators forcing the boys to lay face-down on the bed as they swung a long leather strap down upon the boys. Four men are part of a survivors' organization known as the White House Boys. They are named after the small white cement building on the property where, they claim, the beatings took place. Chris says that discovering what happened at the school explained a lot but didn't excuse it. ""When I was reading the stories on the Web site, the way that they used to beat them kids, [it's] what he used to do to me,"" Chris recalled. ""He'd make me lay face-down on the bed and grab the head of the bed, and if I'd move, he'd start over again,"" he said. Chris said his father beat him seven or eight times like this. He was 12 years old when the beatings started. ""I don't see how he would have done this to his child after it was done to him,"" Chris said. ""And I've hated him for many years for it."" Edward died in 1983. His family says he drank himself to death. With months to live, Chris says, his father would sometimes wake him in the middle of the night. He says he knew his dad was drinking, but one night, his father told him he was forced by school administrators to fire a gun at other boys. ""They made him line up outside of a fence and said that when they turn the lights on, to shoot whoever was at the fence,"" Chris said. ""When they turned the lights on, there was some black kids trying to get out of the fence, and they gave my dad a .22 rifle."" Chris said his father told him he shot one of the boys in the face. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement is the lead agency investigating what happened at the school. The agency will not comment on the story Edward told his son. State officials won't confirm that Edward even attended the Florida School for Boys, citing the ongoing inquiry. Through a spokesman, Florida Secretary of Juvenile Justice Frank Peterman released this statement: . ""Our hearts go out to these men for the alleged incidents they claim to have endured, and we fully support the FDLE investigation into this matter. It would be inappropriate for me to comment further until the investigation has been completed."" But no investigation will make their lives whole again, Elizabeth and Chris say. Marianna changed Edward, and Edward changed them. ""It's shaped my whole life from the time I was 20 years old, and I'm 60 now, so it's shaped how I feel about everything,"" Elizabeth said. Chris said he can't get close to anyone but his mom. He admits that, like his father, he has struggled with alcohol and bouts of nearly uncontrollable anger. ""I carry rage around me all the time. I try not to go anywhere, 'cause any time I go anywhere, I try not to tear somebody's head off. ... I'm so angry all the time,"" he said. ""I can't deal with people very well,"" he acknowledged.","""Edward"" told family he was physically, sexually abused at reform school .

"THE HAGUE, Netherlands (CNN) -- The International Criminal Court at the Hague issued an arrest warrant Wednesday for Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir for a five-year campaign of violence in Darfur. Al-Bashir waves to supporters in the sudanese capital,  Khartoum on Wednesday. It is the first arrest warrant ever issued for a sitting head of state by the world's only permanent war crimes tribunal. Bashir is charged with seven counts of crimes against humanity and war crimes. The warrant does not mention genocide, but the court may issue an amended warrant to include that charge later, ICC spokeswoman Laurence Blairon said. But Sudan's minister of information and communications said the country does not plan to cooperate with the ""white man's tribunal."" Kamal Obaid said: ""Sudan perceives those decisions as an insult directed at (Sudan's) nationalism and sovereignty ... The government relies on the strong will of the people and on a national consensus not seen before and (stands) by decisions taken by its council of ministers and parliament and restates what it always confirmed."" Speaking on Sudanese TV, he added: ""The Security Council and international community must bear full responsibility toward any escalation produced by those clumsy decisions.""  Watch a pro-Bashir rally in Sudan » . Five of the counts against Bashir are for crimes against humanity and include murder, extermination, forcible transfer, torture, and rape, Blairon said. The other two are for war crimes, for intentionally directing attacks against civilians and for pillaging. ""Bashir's official capacity as head of state does not exclude criminal responsibility or get him immunity,"" Blairon said in announcing the warrant. The ICC's chief prosecutor, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, filed genocide charges against al-Bashir in July last year, accusing him of masterminding attempts to wipe out African tribes in the war-torn region with a campaign of murder, rape and deportation.  Watch more on the verdict » . The violence in Darfur erupted in 2003 after rebels began an uprising against the Sudanese government. To counter the rebels, Sudanese authorities armed and cooperated with Arab militias that went from village to village in Darfur, killing, torturing and raping residents there, according to the United Nations, Western governments and human rights organizations.  A man describes how he was told to rape children » . The militias targeted civilian members of tribes from which the rebels drew strength. Moreno-Ocampo told CNN's Nic Robertson last year that he had ""strong evidence that al-Bashir is committing a genocide."" But Blairon said the evidence submitted to judges so far doesn't support that charge.  Watch Christiane Amanpour's reaction to the verdict » . ""In order to speak about a genocide, you need to have a clear intent that a person wishes to destroy, in part or as a whole, a targeted group, a specific group,"" Blairon said. ""In this specific case, the (judges of the) Pre-Trial Chamber 1 has not been able to find that there were reasonable grounds to establish the genocidal intent."" Prosecutors may still return to the chamber if new evidence of genocide emerges, and the court may then decide to issue an amended warrant, she said. Moreno-Ocampo said Wednesday he would have to review the court's decision not to include genocide in the arrest warrant, but he pointed out it is possible to appeal. Al-Bashir bears responsibility for the crimes committed in Darfur, Moreno-Ocampo said last year, because he sat at the apex of the government. ""For such crimes to be committed over a period of five years and throughout Darfur, al-Bashir had to mobilize and keep mobilized the whole state apparatus; he had to control and direct perpetrators; and he had to rely on a genocidal plan,"" Moreno-Ocampo wrote as background for arrest warrant request. The Sudanese government has long rejected the authority of the ICC, saying Sudan is not a signatory to the court's creation so there is no legal obligation to turn al-Bashir over to the court.  Sudan: 'Process is unlawful' » . U.S. State Department spokesman Gordon Duguid issued a statement on the arrest warrant, saying ""the United States is strongly committed to the pursuit of peace in Sudan and believes those who have committed atrocities should be held accountable for their crimes."" The statement urged all groups ""to exercise restraint in responding to this development and to ensure the safety and security of vulnerable Sudanese populations, international civilians, and peacekeepers on the ground."" Germany and the UK both urged Sudan to cooperate with the ICC. ""We deeply regret that the government has not taken these allegations seriously or engaged with the court, and we repeat today our call for its cooperation,"" British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said. The ICC said the obligation to surrender al-Bashir falls on all countries that are also members of the U.N. Security Council and to ""any other state as may be necessary."" And the judges have ruled that additional arrest warrants may be issued for Al-Bashir and served on any state as required, said court registrar Silvana Arbia. Al-Bashir is scheduled to attend an Arab summit in Doha, Qatar, later this month. Moreno-Ocampo said Wednesday that al-Bashir stands the chance of being arrested should he travel. ""The judges were clear: There is no immunity for head of states before the ICC,"" the prosecutor said. ""As soon as Omar al-Bashir travels through international air space, he can be arrested."" ""Omar al-Bashir's destiny is to face justice,"" he added. ""It will be two months or in two years, but he will face justice."" About 300,000 people have died in Darfur, the United Nations estimates, and 2.5 million have been forced from their homes. ""His victims are the very civilians that he, as a president, was supposed to protect,"" Moreno-Ocampo said.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The ""Sons of Anarchy"" actor suspected of killing his landlord before falling to his death on Wednesday had drug issues, mental health problems and was a threat, his probation report said last spring. The May 17 report says that Johnny Lewis, 28, ""suffers from some form of chemical dependency, mental health issue and a lack of permanent housing. Given this, (Lewis) will continue to be a threat to any community he may reside."" Police are seeking to understand what may have sparked the rampage that led to the death of Katherine Davis, 81. She died from ""blunt head trauma and strangulation,"" according to preliminary findings from the autopsy conducted Thursday, the Los Angeles County Coroner's office said. Lewis was arrested twice in February on burglary and battery charges in Santa Monica, according to records obtained by CNN. But Lewis' lawyer, Jonathan Mandel, said Friday that he had not considered his client a threat to anyone. ""The behavior with me was fine,"" he said. ""What was known in May about Johnny was that he had two fairly minor offenses -- which were, fortunately, not serious. And he did have a diagnosis, eventually, of chemically induced psychosis."" Mandel, who first represented Lewis in April, said he never would have predicted Lewis' involvement in a killing and had not suspected he was taking drugs. ""From April until August or September, he was probably using no drugs at all,"" he said. ""He was incarcerated for a couple of months and then he went to a treatment facility."" Though Lewis did appear, at times, to be delusional, ""I never got the sense, when I was representing him, that he was an addict. I did think that he had severe mental problems."" Police suspect drugs may have been involved, but ""we don't have any hard evidence that says he was on anything right now,"" LAPD Commander Andrew Smith said Thursday. Toxicology findings from the autopsy are not expected to be completed for at least a month. No one saw what happened inside the house where Davis, the homeowner, was found beaten to death, Smith said. Two men -- the owner of the house next door and a painter -- say Lewis attacked them before he fell to his death. Other neighbors told police they heard a woman's screams and glass breaking, Smith said. The home is in the Los Feliz neighborhood near Griffith Park, on the eastern edge of the Hollywood district of Los Angeles. An officer responding to a neighbor's 911 call found Lewis dead in the driveway, Smith said Thursday. The house ""appeared to have been ransacked,"" he said. Davis' body was found on the second floor of the three-level house, with her dead cat nearby, police said. Davis, who had lived in the home for decades, ""typically rented to people in the movie industry -- writers and actors -- and they would come up here because it's a wonderful, quiet neighborhood,"" Smith said. Lewis had lived in the home, located on a winding, narrow residential street on the eastern edge of Hollywood, for about two weeks, Smith said. He played Kip ""Half Sack"" Epps in 26 episodes during the first two seasons of ""Sons of Anarchy"" on the FX Network, according to the Internet Movie Database. His character was killed in the finale of season two. ""Sons"" creator Kurt Sutter, in a Twitter posting Thursday, called Lewis' death ""a tragic end for an extremely talented guy, who unfortunately had lost his way."" ""I wish I could say that I was shocked by the events last night, but I was not,"" Sutter's tweet said. ""I am deeply sorry that an innocent life had to be thrown into his destructive path. Yes, it's day of mourning, but it's also a day of awareness and gratitude. Sadly, some of us carry the message by dying."" Sutter told TV writer Alan Sepinwall in an interview published in December 2009 that ""Johnny wasn't happy on the show."" ""Creatively, he really wanted out of his contract,"" Sutter told Sepinwell. ""We had ongoing conversations, and we decided we'd find some noble way for him to go."" Lewis played Dennis ""Chili"" Childress in nine episodes of ""The O.C."" in 2005 and 2006, according to IMDb.com. His last work was in an independent movie, ""186 Dollars to Get Out,"" scheduled for release this month, the IMDb.com listings said. Lewis, whose full name is Jonathan Kendrick Lewis, was born and raised in Los Angeles. He held dual U.S. and Canadian citizenship, according to his IMDb biography.

"(CNN) -- Democratic Gov. Rod Blagojevich and his chief of staff, John Harris, face corruption charges in a scandal that encompassed the Chicago Cubs, President-elect Barack Obama's vacated Senate seat and a children's hospital, according to an affidavit. Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich talks to laid-off workers in Chicago on Monday. The men were each charged with a count of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and a count of solicitation of bribery, authorities said. According to the affidavit outlining some of the charges against the Blagojevich and Harris, here are some of the details that led authorities to charge the officials: . Senate seat . Blagojevich said in phone conversation that he is conspiring to trade the Senate seat left vacant by President-elect Barack Obama in exchange for positions that Obama has the power to appoint, namely the secretary of health and human services post.  Watch how the FBI's tapes show the governor wanted to trade seat » . In a November 3 conversation with an adviser, Blagojevich discussed receiving a kickback for appointing someone, identified only as ""Senate Candidate 1,"" to the vacant Senate seat. Obama reportedly backed the Senate candidate. ""During the call, Rod Blagojevich stated, 'Unless I get something real good for [Senate Candidate 1], s--t, I'll just send myself, you know what I'm saying?' "" the affidavit says. He later said, ""I'm going to keep this Senate option for me a real possibility, you know, and therefore I can drive a hard bargain. You hear what I'm saying? And if I don't get what I want and I'm not satisfied with it, then I'll just take the Senate seat myself,"" according to the affidavit. The governor said the seat ""is a f---ing valuable thing; you just don't give it away for nothing."" ""Blagojevich has also been intercepted conspiring to sell the Senate seat in exchange for his wife's placement on paid corporate boards or Rod Blagojevich's placement at a private foundation in a significant position with a substantial salary,"" the affidavit says. Intercepted phone calls indicate that the governor also has conspired to sell the Senate seat in exchange for millions of dollars in funding for ""a nonprofit organization that he would start and that would employ him at a substantial salary after he left the governorship,"" according to the affidavit. Tribune Co. Blagojevich and Harris threatened to withhold financial assistance from the Tribune Co. unless the company fired certain editorial board members who had been critical of Blagojevich and had called for the governor's impeachment. The money was related to the sale or financing of Wrigley Field, home stadium of the Chicago Cubs, a team owned by the Tribune Co. The governor instructed Harris to tell the Tribune's financial adviser that the assistance, which Blagojevich estimated to be worth at least $100 million, was contingent on the ouster of several board members. In a November 4 phone call, Blagojevich told Harris to tell the Tribune adviser, ""Our recommendation is fire all those f---ing people, get 'em the f--- out of there and get us some editorial support."" The affidavit gives only one name, Deputy Editorial Page Editor John McCormick. In a follow-up conversation, Harris said he had informed the adviser that the newspaper needed ""wholesale changes"" ""This is a priority. Stay on it, right. I mean, he, he gets the message, doesn't he?"" Blagojevich asked. ""Oh, yeah. He got it loud and clear,"" Harris reportedly replied. In another follow-up conversation, Harris said the Tribune owner told the financial adviser that he ""was very sensitive to our concerns"" and that certain cuts personnel cuts were imminent. On November 21, Harris said he had singled out McCormick ""as somebody who was the most biased and unfair."" Beginning November 30, Blagojevich began talking to a sports consultant and a Cubs officials about making state money available for Wrigley Field. Children's hospital . On October 8, Blagojevich told a person described only as ""Individual A"" that he was willing to make $8 million available for Children's Memorial Hospital, but ""I want to get [Hospital Executive 1] for 50."" Individual A felt that Blagojevich was talking about a $50,000 campaign contribution from the hospital's chief executive officer and that the $8 million referred to a recent commitment by Blagojevich to secure state funds via ""some type of pediatric care reimbursement."" ""Intercepted phone conversations between Rod Blagojevich and others indicate that Rod Blagojevich is contemplating rescinding his commitment of state funds to benefit Children's Memorial Hospital because Hospital Executive 1 has not made a recent campaign contribution,"" the affidavit says.","Affidavit says Blagojevich called Senate seat ""a f---ing valuable thing""

"(CNN) -- Out of all the frightening things on television, especially as we near Halloween, I'll admit it's the teen dramas that make me want to leave a light on. Between the dead friends and the supernatural ones, shows I love like ""Pretty Little Liars"" and ""The Secret Circle"" have scenes suspenseful and chilling enough to make someone watch the action from behind a shielding hand. And yes, that someone would be me. I'm a sucker for whodunit suspense, but I have a low tolerance for true horror, making slasher films, psychological thrillers, ghost stories and their ilk off-limits if I want uninterrupted sleep. Knowing I can't hang with the big kids watching ""True Blood"" -- incredibly sad, but yes, also true -- surely I could handle a comparatively tame series. The CW's ""The Secret Circle""? It sounded like nothing more than a lip-glossed, for-TV version of ""The Craft."" Except while I was scoffing at the spotty acting and cheesy, after-school-special plot turns that dot all teen shows, two things happened: The first was that I became completely invested in the storylines, and two, I realized I wasn't giving the source material, show runners or actors enough credit. It's easy to assume that because of the marketing, because of the network or because these shows -- including the CW's other hit, ""The Vampire Diaries"" -- are adapted from young adult novels, they'd be like candy to an adult. And for some, that may be true. But I'd argue that, just as adult fans of YA have been realizing over the past few years, some of the best pop culture just happens to come with a side of teen angst and issues. Perhaps everyone's taking a page from author Maurice Sendak's book and refusing to ""cater to the (BS) of innocence,"" as he told the Guardian this month. So while the entire cast of ""Circle"" may look like they were pulled from the pages of a junior's clothing catalogue and one of the leads does bear the same tortured expression of a ""Twilight"" star, there was nothing sparkly about the fourth episode, ""Heather."" The show, which is adapted from a fictional young adult series of the same name, centers on a group of teens who are the descendants of witches. As they uncover their powers, they run into a variety of threats, including of course, demons. If you've watched a show centered on the supernatural before, including the classic ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" you've run into your fair share of demonic appearances. (Can we have a moment of silence for an OG of scary teen TV? More than a decade later, I still remember the voice-stealing ""Gentlemen"" of season 4's ""Hush."") But I had to tip my hat to actress Camille Sullivan, who portrayed the woman who'd been possessed in that particular ""Secret Circle"" episode, because she officially put ""Heather"" on ""do not watch again"" status. This probably means there are 13-year-olds with a greater constitution than me, and I'm OK with that. While ""The Secret Circle"" hasn't been at all secretive about the dark turns the series will take, ABC Family's ""Pretty Little Liars"" inched up the creep factor throughout its two seasons. Yet another adaptation from a beloved set of books, ""Liars"" offers you the eye-rolling idea of a high school student dating her English teacher with complete seriousness, but you'll also get a twisted storyline of a frenemy who may or may not be dead. If you haven't seen the show, which has skyrocketed over the past year to become one of the most popular programs on TV, that's the central premise: A group of four ""pretty"" and prone to lying friends reconvene after the death of their fifth BFF, Alison. What draws them together in her absence are the intrusive, uncannily knowing text messages from someone (or perhaps more than one person) known as ""A."" Ali's a complicated character, even when she's alive, played convincingly by Sasha Pieterse. But ""Liars,"" part drama and part thriller, raises the stakes with all of the questions surrounding her death. Who killed Ali, and is she really dead? Because if she is, who's this creepy ""A"" that seems to know the secrets of the four main friends? At first, the ""Clue""-like guessing game was the main draw, but as season one turned into season two, ""A"" was revealed to be ruthless. This isn't just a bully, as one speech delivered during the second season tried to claim; this is a masked stalker, kidnapper and killer who has amazing access to just about everyone and everything. If I asked for a show of hands of who was excited and yet sort of terrified to watch this week's Halloween episode, I know without seeing them that mine wouldn't be the only one raised. That special edition didn't disappoint, what with an opening fright of twin-on-twin violence, a fake-out attack and a Halloween costume involving a baby mask that might haunt my dreams. I can keep watching, though, because there is something that separates these shows from the rest of the chilling fare that's offered. The writers give me, and I suspect other scaredy-cats like me, a reprieve. There's a fine balance between the soapier, sillier plots -- it wouldn't be a teen drama without a love triangle or a fated love that seems to be doomed -- and the more frightening moments. If you consider yourself a master of suspense, don't let the baby-faces on teen dramas fool you. If horror has taught us anything, it's the young ones you have to watch out for.","Some of the best pop culture just happens to come with a side of teen angst and issues .

"(CNN)  -- Phoenix police were investigating Sunday how a 45-year-old woman died over the weekend while in police custody at Phoenix's Sky Harbor International Airport. Carol Ann Gotbaum, in an undated family photo, may have accidentally strangled herself while in custody. Carol Ann Gotbaum may have accidentally strangled herself while trying to get out of her handcuffs, Phoenix Police Department spokesman Sgt. Andy Hill said Saturday. ""According to investigators, it appeared as though Ms. Gotbaum had possibly tried to manipulate the handcuffs from behind her to the front, got tangled up in the process, and they ended up around her neck area,"" he said. Witnesses told police that Gotbaum was ""yelling and screaming"" and running through the terminal Friday. She was arrested for disorderly conduct. While handcuffed, the New Yorker became ""disruptive"" and she was taken to a holding room, where she was left alone, Hill told CNN affiliate KTVK. Investigators said officers went to check on her five to 10 minutes later. Police policy requires that be done every 15 minutes. Finding Gotbaum ""unconscious and not breathing,"" Hill said, officers performed CPR. ""Sometime during the time she went into custody, she went into medical distress,"" he said. Gotbaum was the mother of three young children and the daughter-in-law of longtime New York City Public Advocate Betsy Gotbaum. Betsy Gotbaum called Carol Ann Gotbaum ""a wonderful, wonderful person"" and a great mother. She said the family was dealing with the situation ""the best way we can.""

"SEATTLE, Washington (CNN) -- The park bench facing Lake Washington is covered with flowers, poems, a pack of Lucky Strike cigarettes and graffiti. Fans leave flowers and mementos in honor of Kurt Cobain near his Seattle home. ""I miss your beautiful face and voice,"" one dedication reads. ""Thank you for inspiring me,"" says another. ""RIP Kurt."" Fifteen years ago Wednesday, at a house adjacent to the park, Kurt Cobain's dead body was discovered by an electrician. The Nirvana frontman, 27, had committed suicide, police later ruled, killing himself with a shotgun while high on heroin and pills. His death ended a battle with hard drugs and added Cobain to a long list of legendary musicians, such as Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin, whose careers were cut short by their addictions. Cobain's ashes were reportedly scattered in a Washington state river and a New York Buddhist temple. Nirvana band mates Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl eventually formed other bands. Cobain's widow, Courtney Love, stayed in the limelight with an acting career and legal problems surrounding her own drug problems. Frances Bean, the couple's daughter, has largely lived outside the public eye. What was unclear when Cobain died was whether the music Nirvana created would endure or fade away like the grunge craze it helped to inspire. ""At one point I thought, 15 years on, no one would really know who Kurt Cobain was outside of a group of diehard fans,"" said Jeff Burlingame, a Cobain biographer who grew up with the musician in Aberdeen, Washington, and knew him when he was a teenager who, without a place to sleep, crashed on mutual friends' couches. But Nirvana's music endured, and Cobain even found fans in his hometown of Aberdeen, which he had derided as a small-minded town. ""The old-timers who were there when Kurt was around really took offense to some of the things he said about the area, so they had no real reason to honor him,"" said Burlingame, who co-founded the Kurt Cobain Memorial Committee. A famous son is a famous son, though. Now, visitors arriving in Aberdeen are greeted with a sign that reads ""Come As You Are,"" after a famous Nirvana song. Cobain Memorial Committee members, who include Cobain's paternal grandfather, hope to establish a community center in the late rocker's honor that would give area youth a place to play music and pursue artistic interests. A concert will be held Friday in Seattle to honor Cobain and raise money for the center. When Cobain died, he left behind a fortune that was estimated in the millions. Even more money poured in over time from the royalties from his songs. But a lawyer hired by Love, Rhonda Holmes, says most of that money is missing. According to Holmes, Love recently discovered that ""managers, assistants, CPAs, lawyers, people like that who were supposed to be entrusted with carrying for their well-being and finances basically looted the estate."" Forensic accountants are now trying to determine where tens of millions of dollars from Cobain's estate ended up and how it could be recovered, Holmes said.","Kurt Cobain died 15 years ago, a suicide at 27 .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- The governors of Massachusetts and New Hampshire declared states of emergency Friday after high winds, rain and snow swept through the Northeast, leaving at least a million homes and businesses without power. iReporter Candy Novoa says she woke up Friday to find a tree branch lying across her neighbor's car. The National Weather Service said sleet and snow, along with more than half an inch of ice that accumulated on roads in some areas, had made driving treacherous. In Massachusetts, work crews struggled to clear the debris because the powerful storm left roads and bridges covered in ice. Gov. Deval Patrick told WCVB-TV in Boston it would be optimistic to think power would be restored by Monday. ""This is not going to be a couple of hours,"" Patrick said. ""It's likely to be several days."" Patrick mobilized 500 National Guardsmen to help clear roads, WCVB-TV reported. Utility company National Grid reported that nearly 300,000 homes and businesses in Massachusetts were without power. Schools were closed across the state, as authorities warned ice-laden branches could snap and down power lines . ""This is a serious storm,"" John Maserjian, a spokesman for Central Hudson Gas & Electric in upstate New York, told CNN. ""We have contended with worse storms in past years, but this is among the worst."" In New Hampshire, more than 300,000 residents had no electricity, CNN affiliate WMUR in Manchester said, citing reports from four of the state's utility companies. The station reported that fire departments across the state were scrambling to respond to reports of transformer explosions, downed power lines and utility poles, as well as burning and felled trees. The New Hampshire state fire marshal's office told WMUR a 49-year-old man died during the ice storm. WMUR reported a 49-year-old man died from carbon monoxide poisoning while trying to heat his camper using a generator. Gov. John Lynch declared a state of emergency and issued a statement, saying, ""With rain expected to continue and temperatures expected to drop as the day progresses it is important that the state has all its resources available to manage this situation."" Amtrak train service between Albany, New York, and New York City was suspended Friday morning, as was service between Portland, Maine, and Boston, Massachusetts. Ice and wind caused tree limbs to clutter the tracks and work crews could not clear them. Amtrak said it hoped to have service restored by Friday evening rush hour. The National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning Friday morning, saying that increasing winds and significant amounts of snow and sleet were expected. The deteriorating conditions could result in further damage to trees and power lines, the weather service said. Central Maine Power had 220,000 homes and businesses without electricity, spokesman John Carroll said Friday afternoon. In upstate New York, two utility companies reported that more than 200,000 customers were without power . More than 50,000 Central Hudson Gas & Electric customers in the Hudson River Valley were without power early Friday afternoon, said Denise VanBuren, a spokeswoman for the utility. Mutual aid crews in neighboring areas are spread thin, VanBuren said, so utility officials are requesting help from out-of-state crews, meaning power is not likely to be restored until Sunday or Monday. National Grid in New York reported more than 185,000 customers lost power in 23 counties. The company also had 22,000 customers in New Hampshire and 6,000 in Rhode Island without power. Residents also were having to contend with floods caused by excessive rainfall and blocked storm drains. The power outages raised concerns about the health of senior citizens in Holden, Massachusetts, and Goffstown, New Hampshire. Medical crews in Goffstown evacuated the Villager Nursing Home after the facility lost power. Residents were moved to a nearby middle school, WMUR reported. In Holden, senior citizens requiring oxygen were transported to a local hospital or a makeshift shelter at the town's senior center, according to WCVB. ""Stay home if you live in Holden. Don't come to Holden if you work here,"" Holden Fire Chief Jack Chandler told WCVB.

"(CNN)  -- A number of high profile sporting events across Japan have been called off as the country continues to come to terms with the devastation caused by Friday's earthquake and tsunami. Following the 8.9 magnitude quake, it was confirmed on Monday that the World Figure Skating Championships, due to take place in Tokyo between March 21-27, have been postponed. The Japanese Football Association (JFA) announced that there will no matches in the J-League for the rest of the month, and said the domestic season would instead continue into July. The sport's governing body in Japan also said that they would make a final decision over whether to reschedule the upcoming friendly fixtures against Montenegro on March 25 and New Zealand on March 29 later this week. The JFA had originally said it wanted to go ahead with the matches claiming it was more important than ever to do so for the country. However, as the death toll rose to almost 2,000 and aftershocks continued across the country, the president of the International Skating Union (ISU) Ottavio Cinquanta said it would not be possible to hold their annual competition in Japan. ""Taking into account the continued critical developments in Japan, the staging of the championships is not possible,"" he said in a statement. ""The ISU's primary concern is for the safety of all participants and spectators."" Cinquanta added that the organization had not yet decided whether the event would be held at a later date elsewhere or canceled all together. But he but did confirm that Team Trophy in Figure Skating scheduled to be held in Yokohama on April 14-17 had also been called off. Sporting events over the weekend were also been disrupted as the country continued its lengthy search and rescue, and clean-up operations. Sunday's Nagoya International women's marathon did not go ahead, nor did any baseball games, and a LPGA women's golf event in Kochi, which had started on Thursday, was abandoned.","Sporting fixtures are cancelled across Japan following earthquake and tsunami .

"(CNN) -- Mississippi's governor declared a state of emergency Thursday for 12 counties after a severe weather system moved across the southern half of the state overnight Wednesday and Thursday. The storms, which included two tornadoes, damaged at least 108 homes. The storms -- which included two confirmed tornadoes -- damaged 108 homes and injured 24 people, according to the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency's Emergency Operations Center. Simpson County, about 40 miles southeast of Jackson, was hit the worst, it said. A tornado touched down in the county about 4 a.m. Thursday, said Katherine Gunby, spokeswoman for the Emergency Management Agency. Sixty homes were damaged and 20 people were injured in the county, the agency said. Seventeen people were treated in local hospitals and three were transported to the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, it said. Condition reports were not immediately available. Another tornado was reported in Lauderdale County, in eastern Mississippi, where one business was destroyed and 11 homes and a business were damaged, according to the agency. The state of emergency declared by Gov. Haley Barbour ""will allow state resources to be used throughout the affected areas to assist local governments as they respond to this disaster,"" said Mike Womack, director of the Emergency Management Agency, in a written statement. Damage to homes also was reported in Jasper, Jones and Lawrence counties, and power lines and trees were down in Adams, Amite, Lincoln and Madison counties, the agency said. Three injuries were reported in Jones County and one in Jasper County, it said. It gave no further details. The tornadoes destroyed Corinth Baptist Church in Simpson County, leaving only its doors standing. ""The church means so much to this community,"" Pastor Jay Westbrooks told CNN affiliate WAPT. ""We're going to survive. The building is destroyed, but the church is alive,"" he said. ""We're going to come back and rebuild. The weather's not going to stop us."" The Mississippi Department of Transportation and utility companies are working to restore power to the state, Gunby said. While the state of emergency is currently only for nine counties, it will be extended to any future counties that report damage, the Emergency Management Agency said.","NEW: Mississippi governor declares emergency in 12 counties .

"(CNN) -- Two cousins have been convicted of kidnapping a gay man in Kentucky, but the Justice Department failed in the same case to win a guilty verdict in the first test of an expanded hate crimes provision covering sexual orientation. The jury verdict on Wednesday against David Jason Jenkins, 37, and Anthony Ray Jenkins, 20, of Harlan County stemmed from an April 2011 kidnapping of Kevin Pennington, 29, who managed to escape, according an indictment. The men planned to assault Pennington because of his sexual orientation, the indictment said in part. But a federal jury in Laurel County acquitted them of committing a hate crime. Federal hate crimes law was expanded in 2009 to include a victim's perceived sexual orientation, gender or disability. It was named for Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Both men were attacked and killed in separate incidents in 1998 that drew national attention to toughening hate crimes laws broadly. Shepard was gay and Byrd was killed in a racially motivated attack. He was black. Although the government failed to convict the Kentucky men on hate crime charges this week, the Justice Department's top civil rights official, Thomas Perez, said prosecutors would not be discouraged from bringing other cases. Perez called the kidnapping a ""vicious and criminal act"" and said his department would vigorously investigate possible hate crimes. Two female relatives of the Jenkins' cousins pleaded guilty soon after the incident to related charges.","Kentucky jury convicts two men in kidnapping of gay man, but acquits on hate crimes count .

"Washington (CNN) -- When Mitt Romney is agitated, his arms flail. President Barack Obama has a tendency to drone on and on. Debate experts say both should keep those quirks in check during the upcoming presidential debates. That's because in the world of political theater, nobody likes a ham or a know-it-all, said Melissa Wade, a debate professor at Emory University. So Romney should keep that whiteboard full of facts and figures under wraps. And Obama should keep the lecturing to a minimum. ""It's the generation of Twitter and Facebook and efficient language choices are persuasive,"" Wade said. Both candidates are considered skilled debaters -- Romney's campaign called Obama a ""universally acclaimed public speaker,"" and Romney was lauded for his performance during the Republican presidential primary debates. However, there's a lot more to effective debating than clever rhetoric. 10 questions you would ask at the presidential debate . Delivery, tone and body language -- almost as much as substance -- convey a lot to would-be voters, political experts say. Over the next three weeks, voters will have plenty of opportunities to watch the political posturing unfold. Wednesday night's debate in Denver is the first of three between the president and Romney. The first debate focuses on domestic policy, so exchanges are bound to be lively, debate experts say. ""Romney and Obama will disagree with the foundation of what caused our economy to go south,"" said Todd Graham, director of debate at Southern Illinois University. John King: Debate all about trust for Romney . The two men will also mix it up over their different proposals for trimming the nation's debt and entitlement spending, addressing tax rates, and reforming the nation's health care system. For voters keeping score at home, pay attention to ""things like argument depth, trying to get beneath the surface of the argument. They've become quite skilled at not answering the question. They'll repeat the question and then the next few things out of their mouths don't answer the question,"" Graham said. Also, ""Look for inconsistencies ... things they have or have not said before,"" he said. Vice President Joe Biden and Romney's running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, will face off once on foreign policy matters. And like their top-of-the-ticket counterparts, the veep candidates also have some habits to watch out for. ""Ryan has so much less experience that he's going to be on talking points for the ticket,"" Wade said, and that could make him seem a bit stiff. On the other hand, ""Biden has to be careful to not be glib about it and assume his superior knowledge."" Voters have already handicapped the presidential candidates' performance. According to an ABC News/Washington Post national poll released Monday, 55% of likely voters say they think the president will win the debate, with 31% saying the former Massachusetts governor will be victorious. The findings on this question from the new survey are in line with a CNN/ORC International poll conducted right after the Democratic Convention last month, where likely voters predicted by 59% to 34% that Obama was more likely than Romney to prevail in the October showdowns. The campaigns spent the bulk of last week downplaying expectations. Romney debate challenge: High stakes, lowered expectations . However, there's still plenty of room for surprises. ""The mistakes the presidential candidates have made over the years are numerous. Poor body language has been a common blunder. As much as candidates focus on perfecting the substance of what they say before the cameras, a large number of Americans are really most interested to see how they say it,"" CNN contributor and history professor Julian Zelizer wrote for CNN. Despite weeks of preparation and practice with debate sparring partners, candidates often revert to nervous tics under the harsh glare of spotlights. During a 2008 debate, Sen. John McCain paced on stage; in 1992, President George H.W. Bush glanced at his watch; and in 1960, Vice President Richard Nixon was sweaty and cast furtive glances. Both Obama and Romney have similar habits -- ""tells"" that signal that they're nervous. The mistakes candidates make in debates . ""Romney is more aggressive, he talks with his hands more and is more animated. That's not a good thing,"" Wade said, adding that at times Romney seems irritated when pressed. ""He's a smart man ... but because he is not fully consistent in his message, it shows in his face."" Such behavior could come across as impatient, Wade said. ""The best thing he could do is shove those hands in his pocket,"" she said. ""Even if he were to put one hand in the pocket it would calm ... his body and face down."" Why debate is crucial for Obama, too . Obama may have a reputation as ""cool, calm, collected and very comfortable in his body,"" Wade said, but he too has his own set of body language challenges. The town hall format -- such as the one scheduled for October 16 at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York -- is Obama's nemesis. It offers a looser, more classroom-like setting, one in which the former law school lecturer tends to slip into the role of an academic. ""It's his worst format,"" Wade said. ""It was not as pronounced as McCain wandering around. Obama in a town hall is more long-winded. He just can't help himself."" Getting ready for Wednesday's showdown . Both candidates tend to fare well in settings in which they are standing behind podiums. ""The setup with lecterns and longer questions and answers allows for more direct exchange,"" Wade said. ""They're looking at the moderator and the audience, but they're also able to look at each other."" But there's also a psychological disadvantage to this, said SIU's Graham. ""When seated, the candidates become less aggressive,"" he said. For viewers, that's a good thing, Graham added, saying that voters tend to see aggressive debating tactics as bullying. ""For God sakes, don't actually debate. If you actually debate you tend not to do well in the polling the next day,"" he said. ""The public tends to think they were too aggressive and mean and they don't like them."" In Ohio, Romney praises debate partner Portman . Even things like height differences alter perception and the types of gestures a candidate should use, Wade said. ""Most of the presidential primary debates were the standard format of the line of humans behind lecterns. It generates some power dynamics in size difference,"" she added. ""We associate height with power. It's a subtle stereotype that goes on."" So someone smaller, like Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, ""had to use larger hand gestures to compensate with size,"" Wade said. At 6-foot-1 and 6-foot-2 respectively, Obama and Romney are on an even footing.

"(CNN) -- Jason Dinant has the opposite problem of most Americans -- he has flat abs. Jason Dinant's New Year's resolution is to shape up his abs from flat to muscular. Standing 6-feet, Dinant has a beanpole leanness many Americans covet. The 27-year-old's ribs protrude from his chest, but he has some fat collecting in his stomach. ""I don't have that much body fat, but it tends to stick right here in my stomach,"" he said pinching his belly. ""My goal is to get a six-pack by summer,"" Dinant declared in a video he submitted to iReport.com. Dinant often peels off his shirt and gives what he calls ""the naked truth about today's news"" in Web videos he posts on his blog called ""Naked Boy News."" Watch Dinant's video. ""I give reports without a shirt on, so I should have the best body,"" he said.  ""Who wants to see a guy with skinny arms and no abs?"" CNNhealth.com recently asked viewers to talk about their New Year's resolutions on iReport.com and to upload photos and videos during their journey to change. Share your story with iReport.com. Dinant works in sales during the day and has a night job as an emcee at a Las Vegas, Nevada, night club, where he is surrounded by toned and fit dancers. ""There are go-go boys and girls with killer stomachs,"" Dinant said. ""I get up on the stage, I don't take my shirt off. I'm nervous about my stomach."" He doesn't mind going topless on his videos, but he gets self-conscious in person. With his high school reunion fast approaching this summer, Dinant wants to tone up in the next six months and develop chiseled abs like Shemar Moore of TV's ""Criminal Minds"" or Ty Pennington, host of ""Extreme Makeover: Home Edition."" Until recently, the extent of Dinant's exercise has been walking up the stairs and parking his car far away from stores. Now Dinant works out four times a week in a gym inside his apartment complex, cycling on a stationary bike, using weights on his upper body and doing 500 sit-ups a day. A televised Britney Spears interview gave him the idea for the sit-ups routine. ""I heard her saying that she'd do 1,000 sit-ups a day,"" Dinant said. ""She had amazing abs. If she can do it, I can do it."" But the sit-ups get old, Dinant said. To distract himself, he watches TV shows such as ""The Bachelor"" while crunching, or he thinks of games (""Every time you do sit-up, you name an Osmond child"") to pass the time. Contrary to popular opinion, traditional sit-ups aren't the most effective way to get a six-pack, said Robert Dothard, a personal trainer based in Atlanta, Georgia. ""Crunches are great to flatten the stomach,"" he said.  ""For men, we have to put abs under weight resistance to make them stick out."" The ab segments that make up a six-pack exist under layers of fat and skin.  To make the six-pack more pronounced, a person has to exercise and lose the excess fat so those muscles are visible. That comes through cardio exercises. To make those stomach muscles bigger, ""abs have to be put under resistance,"" Dothard said.  Those muscles need weight training to become bigger and more prominent. He recommended doing sit-ups on a stability ball while holding a medicine ball over the head and crunching. Using a resistance band anchored around a stationary bar while performing side-to-side twists also creates resistance, he said. Dothard demonstrated these moves on a video.   Watch Dothard's fitness demonstrations. » . Someone with a svelte frame such as Dinant's may not look as if he or she needs to exercise, but appearances can be deceiving. ""People can be lean, but still carry a lot of fat,"" Dothard said. Research suggests that it's wise for even lean people to lose the belly fat. Even with a normal body mass index, people can carry extra weight in their stomachs, which increases the risk for cardiovascular disease. Those with belly fat have a higher risk of dying compared to their peers without it. But, Dinant's reasons for wanting a taut stomach remain purely aesthetic. ""I have my 10-year high school reunion coming up,"" Dinant said. ""I want to go back and be like, 'Bam. Look at me.'""","An iReporter with flat abs sets his goals this year for a six-pack .

"(CNN) -- The FBI has arrested three East Haven, Connecticut, police patrol officers and one sergeant for their alleged role in the mistreatment of Latinos -- the first arrests to stem from a federal investigation into racial profiling in that town. The men allegedly threatened and assaulted detainees, made false arrests -- including one against a local clergy member -- and later conspired to cover up evidence of their conduct by falsifying reports and blocking an investigation, prosecutors said Tuesday during a news conference in Bridgeport. Sgt. John Miller and officers David Cari, Dennis Spaulding and Jason Zullo were arrested early Tuesday for allegedly conspiring to ""injure, oppress, threaten, and intimidate various members of the East Haven community,"" profiling residents during traffic stops, performing illegal searches and harassing Latino business owners and their advocates, according to the indictment. ""They behaved like bullies with badges,"" said Janice Fedarcyk, assistant FBI director in New York. On one occasion on January 21, 2009, Spaulding and Zullo allegedly assaulted two individuals they had arrested under false pretenses, slamming their heads against the station's cell block walls, the indictment said. The indictment cited a similar incident in which Miller allegedly struck a detainee who was handcuffed after being propped up by two other patrol officers. The men also dismissed a police commission inquiry into their alleged misconduct, it said, calling on the support of local union leaders to block and intimidate municipal investigators. The defendants could not be immediately reached for comment, and the East Haven Police Department referred press inquiries to the mayor's office. ""It's unfortunate that it had to come to arrests,"" said Mayor Joseph Maturo Jr., who said his office ""stands behind the East Haven Police Department."" ""They're innocent until proven guilty,"" he said. Maturo, in an interview with CNN affiliate WPIX, indicated that he saw no problem with not having any Latinos on the East Haven police force. When asked what he would do for the Latino community on Tuesday, Maturo said, ""I might have tacos when I go home, I'm not quite sure yet."" The arrests come just weeks after a scathing Department of Justice report, derived from an investigation that began in September 2009, accusing the town's police of engaging in ""discriminatory policing against Latinos."" In a letter to Maturo, Assistant U.S. Attorney General Thomas J. Perez said the practice was ""deeply rooted in the department's culture,"" citing statistical analysis that showed Latinos had been ""intentionally targeted"" for traffic stops. The letter provided an example of a particular officer's stops, 40.5% of which were of Latino drivers. Overall, the investigation found that 19.9% of traffic stops made by East Haven police were against Latino drivers, concluding it ""shows pervasive discrimination against Latinos on every level of EHPD traffic enforcement activity."" The report also accused some officers of conducting unauthorized immigration investigations. It mentioned ""numerous incident reports"" in which officers contacted Immigration and Customs Enforcement to check on the status or seek an immigration detention of a Latino. Investigators said the tactic was ""used to harass and intimidate Latinos rather than pursue legitimate law enforcement objectives."" But Maturo said he doesn't believe allegations of such systemic discrimination in East Haven are accurate. ""We have an open community here,"" he said. Maturo elaborated in a news release: ""The Town of East Haven is prepared to do all that is necessary to address the consequences of this morning's grand jury indictment. While the Town has several factors to consider, the most important priority is ensuring the continued protection of our Town's residents. To that end, I met with several shifts of officers at our Police Department this morning to ensure that police service to our Town would not be interrupted today and moving forward."" According to 2010 census data, East Haven has a population of some 29,000 people, with about 10.3% identifying as Hispanic or Latino. The vast majority of residents, 88.5%, are white, while close to 3% identify as black or African-American. Still, Maturo said, there have been changes in the wake of the December report. An independent commission of community members, external consultants and former law enforcement officials has been formed to head off future allegations by revising police policies. The mayor cited a series of reforms, including revisions to complaint review policies and training, and pointed to a revised East Haven police handbook, the first update since 1972. ""It was an outdated book,"" Maturo said.","NEW: Mayor's reaction to CNN affiliate: ""I might have tacos when I go home""

"(CNN) -- Dick Cheney, it has been said, fears that ""somebody will Pinochet him."" This extraordinary grammatical twist of the word Pinochet cannot be found in Cheney's recently published memoirs. It was used in several television interviews by Col. Lawrence Wilkerson, the former chief of staff to Colin Powell, to suggest that George W. Bush's vice president dreads the possibility that he, like Gen. Augusto Pinochet, Chile's late dictator, will be put on trial for crimes against humanity in a foreign land. In effect, ever since Pinochet was arrested in London in 1998 and spent the next year and a half fighting extradition to Spain to face charges of having ordered and condoned torture during his regime, ever since the British House of Lords (equivalent to the U.S. Supreme Court) judged that it was valid to indict a head of state for human rights abuses in a country other than the one where those abuses had been committed, the specter of that decision and that fate has haunted rulers and former rulers everywhere. What terrifies Cheney (and perhaps should terrify his boss, Bush, as well) is that one morning he will be sipping his cafÃ© au lait in Paris or strolling along the Thames in London or examining Picasso's ""Guernica"" in the Museo Reina Sofia in Madrid (would he recognize Iraq in that painting?), only to be suddenly tapped on the shoulder and escorted to a nearby police station. Politely, of course -- there would be no roughing him up, no extraordinary rendition, say, to North Korea, certainly no waterboarding in GuantÃ¡namo to get him to come clean, no one whispering in his ear, ""If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear."" And, after being booked, Cheney would be brought before a magistrate to be informed that according to international law, he is indicted for authorizing torture (he has acknowledged direct involvement in approving its use on prisoners detained after 9/11), an activity that is condemned in a covenant that the United States ratified in 1994. And then he will have the chance -- which none of his purported victims did -- of defending himself with attorneys and the possibility of cross-examining his accusers. It's true that the former vice president can avoid all this unpleasantness by simply staying within the borders of his own land and never venturing abroad, except perhaps to Bahrain or Yemen, nations that have not ratified the U.N. Convention Against Torture. What Cheney cannot avoid, however, is the universal shame and disgrace of being targeted and tainted by the word Pinochet, an infamy that, unfortunately, also soils the country where Cheney was born and which now gives him refuge and offers him impunity. By refusing to investigate, let alone prosecute, members of the Bush administration who stand accused by many human rights activists of crimes against humanity, the United States is telling the world that it does not obey the treaties it has signed or even its own domestic laws. It is declaring that some of its citizens -- the most influential of these citizens -- are beyond the reach of the law. It is joining a group of rogue nations that routinely torture and humiliate their prisoners and deny them habeas corpus. It is difficult to exaggerate how much this harms the United States -- a country that throws out the window thousands of years of progress in defining what it means to be human, what it means to have rights due to the mere fact of being human. A country that flouts the Magna Carta and destroys the legacy established by the fathers of American independence and violates the U.N. charter that the United States itself helped to create after World War II when the cry of ""never again"" rose from a wounded planet. A country that applauds the trial of Hosni Mubarak in Egypt and scorns the torture chambers of Moammar Gadhafi in Libya and deplores the massacres in Syria, but will not hold accountable one of its own elite. There is a way, of course, to be rid of this stigma and, also, to verify whether Cheney's claims of innocence (like those of Pinochet) are valid. Put Cheney on trial in the United States itself. Let a jury of his peers decide whether, as he himself has stated, it would have been unethical or immoral ""not to do everything we could"" (in other words, torture) ""in order to protect the nation against further attacks like what happened on 9/11."" Examine publicly whether those ""enhanced interrogations"" were, in effect, necessary to keep America safe or if, on the contrary, they have endangered the country's security by debasing its moral standing and creating more jihadists bent on new acts of terrorism. Justice for all. The last three words of the Pledge of Allegiance that schoolchildren all across America recite each morning, their hands on their hearts before the flag, the words I spoke out as a child in New York and carried with me into my many exiles. Not justice for one. Or justice for some. Or justice for almost everybody. For all. Those oh-so-simple three words are stating that it does not matter how powerful you are, whether you were a tyrant such as Pinochet or a man such as Cheney who was a mere heartbeat away from the presidency of the United States, you can never be above the law. All. A word synonymous with humanity, all of it, every first and last one of us -- the ruler who commands millions and the victim screaming in the darkness for a reprieve from pain. If Cheney really loved his country, he would demand that a grand jury be convened, he would want a world where the schoolchildren of tomorrow, his own grandchildren and great-grandchildren, can truly pledge that there will be justice for all. He would want to clear his name and never more see it even remotely associated with Pinochet, that thief, that traitor, that man who tortured his own people and lives on only in the annals of villainy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ariel Dorfman.","Ariel Dorfman: Ex-Colin Powell aide says Dick Cheney fears ""somebody will Pinochet him""

"(CNN) -- Strontium sulfide, a material that can emit corrosive gases in moist air, was found at trace levels in testing of Chinese-made drywall, the Florida Department of Health said. Gas emitted from defective drywall corrodes copper wiring, turning it black, some Florida homeowners say. The drywall samples gave off a sulfurous odor when heated, and in at least one case, sulfide gases corroded copper coils in an air conditioner of a Florida home containing Chinese drywall, said the department, which commissioned the study. But more testing is needed to determine whether strontium sulfide was causing the odor and contributing to the corrosion, the department said. And more tests are required to determine whether the drywall poses a threat to human health -- a process that probably will take at least several months, state toxicologist Dr. David Krause told reporters Monday. ""It's very hard to predict when we'll have the answers [relating to possible health hazards]. ... We're moving as quickly as possible,"" Krause said. Concerns about Chinese-made drywall, which is suspected by some homeowners of ruining appliances and causing health problems, emerged in Florida last year but have transcended state lines, with class-action lawsuits alleging it has caused problems in at least three states: Florida, Louisiana and Alabama. The Florida Department of Health has received about 150 complaints, and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission says it is investigating the Florida allegations. Homeowners' lawsuits against certain manufacturers and suppliers contend the drywall has caused them to suffer health problems such as headaches and sore throats, and left them facing huge repair expenses. The drywall is alleged to emit sulfur-based gases that smell of rotten eggs and corrode piping and wiring, causing electronics and appliances to fail. The Florida Department of Health said complaints there generally involve homes built between 2004 and 2007, around the time a building boom and post-hurricane reconstruction caused a U.S. drywall shortage and spurred builders to use imports. The latest tests did not deal with air quality inside affected homes, and previous third-party testing has ""not identified any concentrations of chemicals that are in the homes that are at a level ... that would pose a specific health risk,"" Krause said. ""That isn't saying we've declared it safe,"" Krause said. ""We are continuing the evaluation and moving forward on a much more in-depth and broad scope of the investigation."" The latest testing, commissioned by the Florida Health Department and conducted by private laboratory Unified Engineering Inc. of Illinois, found that three samples of what the department believes is Chinese-manufactured drywall had ""several physical and chemical differences"" from a fourth, U.S.-manufactured drywall sample, Krause said. The samples suspected to be from China contained trace levels of strontium sulfide, and the U.S.-made product did not, according to Unified's report. Strontium sulfide can react in moist air to form hydrogen sulfide -- a gas that smells like rotten eggs, according to the Web site of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Hydrogen sulfide is corrosive, according to a Web page of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Exposure to low levels of the gas ""may cause irritation to the eyes, nose or throat ... [and] may also cause difficulty breathing for some asthmatics,"" according to the federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. Two of the China samples were marked as having been made in China or by a Chinese manufacturer. The other was unmarked, but the department believes it to be Chinese-made because it appears to ""have many of the same physical and chemical characteristics"" of the other two products, Krause said. The Chinese-made drywall emitted a sulfurous odor when exposed to extreme heat in testing, while the U.S.-made product did not, according to Unified's report. However, the report doesn't conclude that the strontium sulfide contributed to the odor. ""Because initial tests only detected small quantities of this substance, further tests are necessary to determine if it is the cause of odors and corrosive gases,"" Krause said. Unified also found that the outer paper and core of two samples -- a piece of Chinese-made drywall and a piece of the U.S.-made drywall -- emitted trace levels of hydrogen sulfide and two other volatile, sulfur-containing gases when put into a chamber and exposed to 95 percent humidity. However, because the U.S. sample came from a home that also had Chinese-made drywall, cross-contamination could have occurred. More testing is needed, Krause said. One of the emitted gases was carbon disulfide, Unified's report said. Breathing it at low levels for long periods ""may result in headaches, tiredness, trouble sleeping and slight changes in the nerves,"" according to the Web site of ATSDR, which is part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The emission tests were useful in determining what the drywall may produce, but conclusions cannot be drawn about health risks, Krause said. That's in part because the concentrations of emissions captured in laboratory testing are not useful to determine what concentrations would be found in the much larger volume of air in homes, he added. ""We shouldn't interpret it for anything at this point,"" Krause said. ""These are not exposure measurements."" The Unified test results showed that heat and humidity play a key role in getting the drywall to emit the odors. ""This may explain why the problem has developed in South Florida first, where hot and humid conditions prevail,"" Krause said. A Unified test also showed that sulfide gases in a Florida home that contained Chinese-made drywall were the main reason that an air conditioner's copper tubing corroded, Krause said. The report did not say whether the gases came from the drywall. Earlier testing by ENVIRON International, a private consulting firm hired by a Florida-based homebuilder, found that certain drywall manufactured in China was emitting sulfur gases capable of ruining copper coils in air-conditioning systems. However, it said it found air samples in the homes showed no indication that health hazards existed. The Consumer Product Safety Commission is ""already sending additional experts from headquarters to Florida to further our investigation,"" commission spokesman Joe Martyak said Monday.","Toxicologist: Months of more investigating needed before determining health threat .

"(CNN) -- Jeanne Thomas was sitting at her desk at work when she decided to check the security camera that she installed in her home. The Thomas home had been burglarized before, so she installed a monitoring device where she can watch a live video feed of the camera in her home. Steven Morales, 19, was arrested in the invasion of a Boynton Beach, Florida, home. When Thomas decided to pull up the feed of her house Wednesday morning, she couldn't believe what she saw. There was someone inside her home, someone she didn't know. Thomas picked up the phone and called 911. ""I'm watching my home on live monitor, and there is a black man in my house, and he is robbing it,"" she told the dispatcher. The woman on the other end of the call asked Thomas where she was, and Thomas replied, ""I'm in Fort Lauderdale, at my work."" Thomas' home is in Boynton Beach, Florida, more than 20 miles away, yet she was watching over the Internet as two men walked through her home, picking up items.  Watch the video from Thomas' home » . Police later arrested Curtis Williams, 20, and Steven Morales, 19. According to the Boynton Beach Police, Williams and Morales entered the house through a pet door. As the 911 dispatcher was calling police to the scene, Thomas stayed on the line, giving a play-by-play of what she was seeing. ""He's in my house. I am seeing him walk around my house. He's in my bedroom right now,"" she said. The bedroom cannot be seen in the video, but the door from the living room into the bedroom is visible. Thomas watched as the men wandered through her home, taking valuables such as her TV and Wii gaming console. ""This is unbelievable,"" she told the 911 dispatcher. ""The cat is freaking out. The dogs are hiding."" One of the burglars took a bag of shredded cheese from the refrigerator and could be seen on the video stuffing it in his mouth. None of them noticed the small camera that resembles an air freshener. ""They walked right up to it and didn't know what it was,"" Thomas said later. A few minutes after Thomas called 911, the video shows police officers entering the home. According to the police report, ""Williams and Morales had placed the victim's 37 inch flat screen TV, a safe, gaming machine with several misc. games (total value approx. $3000) on the victim's bed."" Williams and Morales told police that two other people, not seen on video, were also involved in the incident. All four suspects were arrested and charged with burglary of a dwelling and attempted grand theft. Thomas' husband thought she was nuts for spending $250 on the webcam system, telling her she would never catch anyone. But to her, it now seems like a smart investment. Thomas hopes it will be a lesson for burglars. ""You never know who is watching you,"" she said.","At work in Fort Lauderdale, woman checked on home and saw unknown men .

"(CNN) -- ""Who controls the past controls the future."" President Reagan's former aides say Obama's budget repudiates Reaganomics. It's a line from George Orwell's novel ""1984."" But it could also serve as the rallying cry for two groups battling over President Obama's ambitious domestic agenda -- and the legacy of two former presidents. Critics of Obama's proposed $3.5 trillion federal budget say he's poised to jeopardize the economic gains unleashed by President Reagan. They say he will make the same mistakes that President Lyndon B. Johnson did when he committed massive amounts of federal money to create a slew of anti-poverty programs dubbed ""The Great Society."" ""The Great Society created a lot of programs and wasted a lot of money,"" said Kenneth Khachigian, a former Reagan speechwriter and adviser. ""The biggest war on poverty was the economic boom started by Reagan."" But others like Joseph Califano Jr., Johnson's senior domestic adviser, say the notion that the Great Society was a failure is one of the ""greatest political scams"" in American history. Republican leaders who have labeled Obama's budget proposals socialist are rehashing the rhetoric their predecessors used to attack Great Society programs like Head Start 40 years ago, Califano says. ""I'm hearing the same round of arguments,"" Califano said. ""The Republicans said that if you provide Head Start and preschool education to poor kids, it would 'Sovietize' our kids and be communistic."" 'Failure' of the Great Society . The clash between both points of view centers on Obama's plan for reviving the nation's economy. The Senate and the House of Representatives passed similar versions of Obama's $3.5 trillion budget for 2010 last week. The budget didn't receive a single Republican vote in either chamber. Both chambers will meet after Easter recess to produce a final budget. Even before last week's vote, though, Obama's budget was creating a partisan wedge. Proponents said it would use trillions of dollars to transform education, spark a green industrial revolution and provide health care to all Americans. CNN political analyst David Gergen said Obama's budget ""set forth the most ambitious reform agenda of any president since Lyndon Johnson."" Gergen's comment could be taken as a compliment or a reprimand, depending on one's historical point of view. Craig Shirley, author of ""Reagan's Revolution: The Untold Story of the Campaign That Started It All,"" took it as a warning. His model for reviving the nation is Reagan, who moved ""power from the government to the people"" by cutting taxes and making government less intrusive. Shirley, alluding to an alleged Reagan quip that ""Johnson declared war on poverty and poverty won,"" says out-of-wedlock births, illiteracy and bloated federal programs increased during the Great Society. He says Medicare and Medicaid, two vaunted Great Society programs that provide health care to the poor and elderly, are now virtually bankrupt. ""All evidence says that the Great Society was a failure,"" Shirley said. Khachigian, Reagan's speechwriter, says Obama's budget would also create tension between people who fought their way up the economic ladder and those who did not. Under Obama, the well-off would be ""brought back down through higher taxes and subsidizing benefits for people who have not worked as hard."" Obama's budget is influenced by the president's previous job as a community organizer, Khachigian says. ""You can't have been a community organizer and not have in your mindset that agencies of the government exist to, as Obama said, to 'spread the wealth,' '' Khachigian said. If Obama wants to look at an economic blueprint for lifting the nation out of a nasty recession, he should look at Reagan, Khachigian says. Reagan's tax cuts helped end the deep recession he inherited when he came into office, he said. The economy took off, and everyone benefited. ""I would argue that the biggest war on poverty took place when the economy started booming in 1983,'' Khachigian said. The 'myth' of Reagan's tax cuts . Other analysts had a different take on the legacy of the Reagan Revolution and what it can teach Obama. Will Bunch, author of ""Tear Down This Myth: How the Reagan Legacy Has Distorted Our Politics and Haunts Our Future,'' says Reaganomics is built on a fable. Reagan didn't prove that tax cuts and small government lead to economic growth, because he never consistently did both, he says. Bunch says Reagan did cut taxes in 1981 but raised them in succeeding years. He also expanded the federal government and created a huge national debt. ""His initial 1981 tax cuts went so far that he was actually forced to increase taxes a half-dozen times in the years that followed, something you never hear about,"" Bunch said. Obama would do better to follow the example of Johnson, not Reagan, says Califano, Johnson's senior domestic adviser. He says Johnson's Great Society was designed to give the most vulnerable Americans -- the poor, the elderly, the disabled and racial minorities -- the same opportunities as the affluent. ""The Great Society saw government as providing a hand up, not a handout,"" said Califano, who wrote about his time with the president in ""The Triumph and Tragedy of Lyndon Johnson."" He says the Great Society proved that government wasn't incompetent. Johnson persuaded Congress to pass at least 100 Great Society proposals. Programs awarded college students financial aid, gave struggling families food stamps and gave millions of Americans access to health insurance for the first time. It also reduced poverty, Califano says. About 22 percent of Americans lived below the poverty line when Johnson took office in 1963. By 1970, when the impact of Great Society programs was being felt, the poverty rate dropped to 12.6 percent, Califano says.

"(CNN) -- A California woman accused in the rape and murder of 8-year-old Sandra Cantu fought tears Tuesday as a judge read the charges against her in a brief court appearance. Melissa Huckaby is charged with killing 8-year-old Sandra Cantu, who was a friend of her own daughter. Wearing red jail scrubs over a white T-shirt, Melissa Huckaby, 28, flinched at the mention of Sandra's name. She is charged with killing Sandra, who was a friend of her own daughter. The Sunday school teacher's lip quivered and a single tear rolled down her cheek as the judge read special circumstances alleged against her -- that the murder was committed in conjunction with a kidnapping, the performance of a lewd and lascivious act upon a child, and rape by instrument. Huckaby did not enter a plea or speak during the appearance. Public defender Ellen Schwarzenberg, who appeared in court with Huckaby, said she would not enter a plea at that time, adding she had spoken with Huckaby ""very briefly."" Read the complaint (PDF) The matter was continued for arraignment on April 24. Schwarzenberg requested a gag order be imposed in the case, but the judge put off that matter until April 24 as well. Huckaby will remain in the San Joaquin County Jail without bond. Huckaby is undergoing a medical evaluation as part of another case, an alleged petty theft being handled in a mental health court, Willett said. Asked whether that would affect the murder case, he said, ""Obviously, any mental health issues would have an effect on this case."" Schwarzenberg said she hopes people will not rush to judgment in the case until all the facts are known. If convicted as charged, Huckaby faces the death penalty or life in prison without parole, San Joaquin County District Attorney James Willett told reporters after the hearing. A decision on whether to seek the death penalty will be made later, he said. Sandra's body was found April 6, stuffed into a suitcase and submerged in a pond at a dairy farm. Huckaby was arrested Friday night after questioning by police. Sandra was last seen alive March 27 in the mobile home park where she lived with her family -- the same mobile home park where Huckaby lives with her own 5-year-old daughter. The two children were close friends and played together frequently, police said. Huckaby is the granddaughter of Clifford Lane Lawless, pastor of Clover Road Baptist Church near the mobile home park, and she taught Sunday school at the church, police said. The church was searched as part of the investigation into Sandra's disappearance and death. Before her arrest, Huckaby acknowledged to a newspaper reporter that she owned the suitcase that contained Sandra's body. But Huckaby said the suitcase had been stolen. Willett declined to comment on any of the evidence or allegations in the case, saying evidence would be presented in court.

"(CNN) -- Verizon pulled a rabbit out of its corporate hat earlier this month. The wireless giant announced a multibillion-dollar deal to purchase rights to largely unused spectrum, which is like an open lane on the congested wireless Internet highway. Verizon purchased these rights from Comcast and Time Warner, two large cable-TV companies, and the smaller Bright House Networks. Sound familiar? AT&T made a similarly surprising move in March, declaring its intention to buy T-Mobile, in large part to get access to T-Mobile's underused spectrum. The AT&T deal drew the wrath of the Justice Department and the FCC. Indeed, it appears the current incarnation of the AT&T proposed merger is dying a slow death. U.S. District Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle agreed on Monday to a request from both sides to delay the merger hearing, and asked AT&T to supply information on whether it will pursue a different deal with T-Mobile. Does a similar fate await Verizon? Ah, you say, there's no real comparison. Unlike the proposed AT&T/T-Mobile merger, Verizon's acquisition doesn't involve taking millions of subscribers from a competitor, thereby increasing concentration in the wireless market. But the deals do have one big thing in common: In both, the primary objective is to cope with the looming scarcity of spectrum. For without more of it, neither carrier will be able to deliver on the promise of whizbang wireless services such as high definition movies any time, anywhere. To be sure, the problem here is not precisely a shortage of spectrum, but wasteful allocation of what's usable with the latest technology. If Washington were so inclined, it could free up a ton of spectrum for more valuable uses. That includes spectrum warehoused by government: In many cases, the repositioning of equipment or the purchase of up-to-date equipment would allow tasks ranging from public safety communication to weather forecasting to be done as well with less. Not to mention spectrum assigned long ago to local TV stations for old-fashioned analogue broadcasting that is no longer needed since the switch to digital. The process would be pretty simple: Auction the spectrum to the highest bidders and then allow it to be traded like any other valuable resource. This is an old, but important, idea first suggested by Nobel economics laureate Ronald Coase back in 1959. And it's an idea that has taken on greater urgency in recent years, both because of the proliferation of spectrum-hungry wireless devices -- smartphones and tablets -- and because Washington desperately seeks revenue. (We're talking tens of billions here.) But the politics of spectrum allocation remain gridlocked, as competing interests push and shove for preferred access, or just a claim on some of the cash from future spectrum auctions. So AT&T and Verizon, the No. 1 and 2 players in the American wireless market, have resorted to end-runs around the problem -- that is, buying spectrum from other carriers or merging to make more efficient use of the partners' combined holdings. If the AT&T/T-Mobile combination survives the legal gantlet, it could, in theory, become the largest U.S. wireless provider, with as much as one-third of the market. But the emphasis here is on the word ""theory."" The merger might or might not reverse T-Mobile's sinking fortunes, which is why its parent company, Deutsche Telekom, has signaled its intent to leave the U.S. market, no matter what the government decides about the merger. The upshot is that it's far from self-evident that AT&T would remain first in subscribers for long in a post-merger market. Verizon's 4G system, the holy grail of mobile excellence, is expected to be available to some 200 million Americans by the end of this year, compared with roughly 70 million for AT&T. Moreover, the proposed Verizon deal includes cross-marketing with the cable companies' retail stores, yet another advantage in this most visible of consumer markets. But the merger seems to face implacable opposition from the trust-busters at the Justice Department and the micromanagers at the FCC. Both agencies argue that it would give AT&T more latitude to raise prices. And neither apparently puts much weight on AT&T's need for additional spectrum if it is to offer viable competition for Verizon in a 4G world. If this were 1951 instead of 2011, when self-satisfied American megacompanies like GM set the pace for global industrial innovation, we'd have more sympathy for the government's tilt against market concentration. But as the Verizon gambit makes clear, this is anything but a static contest. AT&T and Verizon are living in uncertain times in which they must run to stay in place. That doesn't mean the risk of monopoly power is as dead as the Oldsmobile. But it does mean that discretion in managing markets really has become the better part of valor. As we see it, Washington has three options. The first is to limit what firms like Verizon and AT&T can do to improve their service offerings, slowing the rollout of 4G. The second is to break through interest-group gridlock and stimulate improvements in the wireless market with a lot more spectrum -- the best option, surely, but probably a political nonstarter in the near term because the relevant players seem unable to build the necessary political coalitions. The third option, and probably the best under the circumstances, is to look on the Verizon and AT&T gambits with sympathy, on the premise that the vitality of innovation means more to consumers than the potential downside of greater market concentration. Does that mean giving AT&T and Verizon free passes? Hardly. But it would mean a change in priorities at Justice and the FCC in which the agencies use their legal leverage to minimize concentration in regional wireless markets without undermining the potential for more efficient use of spectrum. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers.","Writers: Verizon, AT&T deals are attempts to get more spectrum for wireless services .

"(CNN) -- Lawmakers in Argentina have approved a gender identity law that allows individuals to be recognized in official documents by the gender they choose. Argentinians have the right to be treated in accordance with their own gender identity, and the government is required to recognize it as well, the law states. The law gained final approval from the Senate on Wednesday. ""It is understood that gender identity is the internal and individual way that a person experiences their gender, which may or may not correspond with the sex assigned at birth,"" the law states. This means that people 18 or older in Argentina can go to a government office and change the gender listed on official documents if they choose. The law is meant to include people who undergo sex change operations or hormone treatments to look like the opposite sex, but it goes further than that. Those who dress, talk or have manners like someone of the opposite sex also qualify to have their documents changed to recognize their self-identity. A push for such a law began under the late President Nestor Kirchner, and the cause was taken up by his wife and presidential successor, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner. ""(The law) is a path toward equality, inclusion and recognition of rights for all Argentinians,"" Vice President Amado Boudou said. ""Today is a day when thousands and thousands of Argentinians have new rights, without anyone else losing an ounce of their own rights.""","The law was passed by the Senate on Wednesday .

"Boston (CNN) -- It is one of Mitt Romney's favorite selling points. Romney often notes that as governor of Massachusetts, he worked with a mostly Democratic legislature to tackle his state's problems. ""It did not take a rocket scientist to figure out if I was going to do anything as governor, I had to have a working relationship with the Democrats,"" Romney said at a campaign event last year in Nashua, New Hampshire. But inside the Massachusetts State House, down the hallway from Romney's official portrait that hangs inside the governor's office, longtime lawmakers on both sides of the aisle remember a more CEO-style leader. Robert Hedlund, the second-ranking Republican in the state Senate, said Romney tried to carry over the corporate culture that existed at his former private investment firm, Bain Capital, in a way that sometimes alienated Democrats who were accustomed to a different way of doing things. ""He was all business. It was all about policy. He didn't trade jobs for votes. He didn't trade capital projects for votes. So that came back to bite him a little bit,"" Hedlund said. Romney replaced many of the career bureaucrats in the executive staff with private sector outsiders. At times, Hedlund argued, that management structure produced results in balancing the state's budget. ""Some Democrats begrudgingly, maybe not publicly on camera, but privately will admit that he had a lot of great, talented people around him who got the job done,"" Hedlund said. Across the aisle, Romney still gets positive reviews for his willingness to work with Democrats to pass health care reform. However, many rank-and-file Democrats are still bothered by what they describe as a distant and guarded leader. ""He had three security people around him, and you could never get to touch him or say hello,"" said state Rep. Frank Smizik, chairman of the House Committee on Global Warming and Climate Change. ""He was very elitist."" On this reporter's unannounced visit to the Legislature, there was no shortage of Democratic lawmakers who complained about Romney's unprecedented move to block off one State House elevator specifically for the governor's office. ""He took over the elevator for the west wing of the building. He kept it only for his staff and him,"" Smizik said. Listening in on Smizik's comments, another Democrat, state Rep. Ellen Story, said the elevator restrictions and security ropes installed outside Romney's office turned off some lawmakers for good. ""When Romney came in, he treated government like the only thing he ever knew, which was big business, and he was the CEO of the big business,"" Story said. Another lawmaker, Democratic state Rep. John Scibak, was far more blunt in his feelings about Romney. ""Many people said, 'Good riddance. Don't let the door hit you on the way out,' "" Scibak quipped about Romney's decision to forgo a second term to run for the presidency in 2008. Aides to the Romney campaign chalked up some of the hard feelings among State House Democrats to election-time loyalties to President Barack Obama. But the campaign called on another Democratic lawmaker, state Rep. Jim Vallee, to offer some positive comments on Romney's time as governor. ""I think you're getting a lot of partisan political comments,"" Vallee said in reference to the Democratic criticism of Romney. ""Did he have an ego? Absolutely,"" Vallee said. ""But what do you expect?"" he asked, describing Romney as ""high-caliber."" ""He wanted to turn the company around,"" Vallee said about Romney's hope to fix the state's fiscal problems. ""I had a positive relationship with him. I know that some people did not."" Mike Widmer, a government watchdog with the nonpartisan Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, noted Romney set aside his CEO approach to woo Democratic leaders to pass health care reform. The law -- widely considered to be Romney's signature achievement -- is memorialized in his official State House portrait, sitting on a small table along with a framed picture of the former governor's wife, Ann. Romney struggled in other areas such as job creation, Widmer said, in part because of the governor's CEO style. However, Romney was beginning to divert his attention to pursuing the White House, Widmer and other state lawmakers recalled. ""He clearly had his sights set on running nationally,"" Widmer said. ""That was no secret. Certainly not among the political leaders."" State House insiders, such as Widmer, often contrast Romney's style with another recent Republican governor, William Weld, who seemed to revel in the kind of behind-closed-doors backslapping that Democrats had come to expect over the years. ""Governors aren't CEOs. They just aren't,"" Widmer said. Democratic leaders, who now dominate the Massachusetts State House and control the governor's office, gleefully note the rope lines are gone and the Romney executive elevator has since been reopened to the general public. Romney's Democratic successor, Gov. Deval Patrick, conceded he made those changes after taking office. ""I'm a governor of, with and for the people. We have a different style in that respect,"" Patrick said, adding he has great respect for Romney. Vallee noted Patrick has also upset Democratic lawmakers with his reform efforts. ""You can pick apart any of these guys,"" Vallee said.","Democrats controlled Massachusetts Legislature during Mitt Romney's tenure .

"Des Moines, Iowa (CNN) -- From church pews to cheeseburger joints, Iowa's faithful are a major prize in the political ground war raging between President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney. Of the roughly 3 million Iowans, about 30% call themselves evangelical or Catholic. Fifty-seven percent of Iowans who voted in the caucuses this year were evangelical Christians. Evangelicals overwhelmingly supported Rick Santorum over Romney in the Iowa caucuses, helping Santorum squeeze out a slight victory in the final count. In Des Moines, evangelical Christians flock to Grace Church, affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention, to talk faith, family and the presidential election. The evangelical voters we met strongly supported Romney, but they also expressed a general unease about his moderate history on social issues such as abortion. Obama, Romney paths to victory cross in Iowa . ""His (Romney's) past positions in terms of abortion or in terms of his record in Massachusetts -- it's not been an easy choice to make either way,"" Mwasi Mwamba said. Mwamba said he has no party affiliation and voted early. His wife, Dawn, plans to vote for Romney but said her religious beliefs don't align with either candidate. ""I have to look at it, though I hate saying it this way, as the lesser of two evils if you will."" The Undecided Evangelical: Radical for Jesus, dubious of Romney . Sheri Hess described herself as having a ""biblical worldview."" Hess plans to vote for Romney this year but admitted his record on social issues concerns her. ""He's definitely not a Christian in my view,"" she said when asked if Romney's Mormon faith plays into her vote. But she said she thinks he supports the Christian beliefs she holds dear. One evangelical voter not supporting Romney is Mike Pike. He won't vote for either candidate -- he's not casting a ballot in a presidential election for the first time in his life. Pike said the two non-negotiable issues for him are abortion and the definition of marriage as being between a man and a woman. Ohio: Overwhelmed by ads . Obama and Romney, he said, have ""failed on both of those."" ""What a person says and what they do, when they're two different things, I have to go by what they've done so therefore I can't support either candidate in this election."" In December, ahead of the Iowa caucuses, Steve Scheffler, president of the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition, said the Romney campaign ""has a very deliberate plan to snub social conservatives."" But this week in Des Moines, he had changed his tune, saying Romney has ""proved that he has tried to make that outreach to social conservatives and economic conservatives and he's done a good job in Iowa."" For Catholic voters, it's the first time they've had a choice between two tickets -- each with a Catholic on it. Battleground Blog: A deeper look inside the swing states . In traditionally democratic Dubuque, some Catholic voters are split over issues such as abortion, funding for contraception and same-sex marriage. They disagree on how best to help the poor -- through government-run social programs or private charity. ""(There are) the life issues which most Catholics hold dear and central to their faith, but then there's this belief that remains that the Democratic Party somehow cares for the poor better. I think it somehow comes down to that tension,"" said Dawn Luekin, a Catholic voter and member of St. Joseph the Worker parish in Dubuque. She's a fervid opponent of abortion, as is her mother, Ellen Markham, who said the top issues for her in this election are ""life and sanctity of marriage."" Both support Romney. Quiz: Which Jesus do you believe in? At the Village Inn restaurant in Dubuque, Jenni, a Catholic voter and Obama supporter who didn't want to share her last name, said she was concerned about backlash from co-workers. She cast an early vote for Obama this year. She's pro-abortion rights and calls it one of the top issues for her in this election but maintains her religion does not affect her vote. 10 things you didn't know about Iowa . Sue, a practicing Catholic who also declined to give her last name, was eating a cheeseburger when we chatted with her at the Village Inn. She said it is hard to reconcile abortion with her religious beliefs but said she is supporting Obama. ""I can't bring myself to just vote on that one issue."" But for Caroline Koppes, who is Catholic and an Obama campaign volunteer in Dubuque, it's clear-cut. ""I just think we have got to get out of the bedrooms, and if we're against big government and we are knocking on the doors of every bedroom that is ridiculous."" Romney's vision for America . Then there are the coveted undecided voters, such as retiree Lois Nilles. She's fed up with the partisan bickering in Washington. She said she thinks Obama has done a ""fairly good job"" considering tough opposition from Republicans in Congress, but as a practicing Catholic she is bothered by his abortion-rights stance. Obama's vision for America . Complicating the president's relationship with Catholics in an election year, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has been vocal in its opposition of the Obama administration's rule requiring health insurers to provide free contraceptive coverage. Catholic teaching opposes contraception and considers some methods of contraception to be tantamount to abortion. Nationwide, Obama won 54% of the Catholic vote in 2008 and 26% of the evangelical vote, according to the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life. Those religious votes are key in Iowa -- a battleground state with six electoral votes -- or as folks here call it, a ""purple state.""

"Rustenburg, South Africa (CNN) -- Dozens of South African miners defied orders to work Friday after a deadline arrived for management to respond to their list of grievances. About 100 workers at Anglo American Platinum in Rustenburg refused to work and demanded that the company address the list submitted a week ago. The miners resumed work after management held talks with six people selected to represent the workers, the company said in a statement. The two sides plan to continue working on a resolution. What's behind the Marikana massacre? ""We are pleased that the meeting ended on a positive note and would like to applaud our employees for acting in a manner that assured their safety and that of their colleagues,"" the company said in a statement. It did not say whether the talks yielded any results. The incident marks the latest labor discontent in the nation's mining heartland in the northwest. South Africans held memorial services nationwide Thursday for victims of clashes at the Lonmin Marikana mine. The strikes started as protests demanding higher wages, but escalated into one of the worst incidents of violence in post-apartheid South Africa. The clashes left 44 people dead, including 34 killed when police opened fire on charging protesters on August 16. An additional 10 people, including police officers, died in days leading up to that. A rivalry between two unions that wield a lot of power and influence in the nation added to the tension. The unions, accused of trying to outdo each other in negotiating wages, denied instigating the clashes. In addition to the two companies, there are signs of labor discontent at nearby Bafokeng Rasimone Platinum Mine. About 1,000 workers protested this week to voice their discontent over wages. They resumed work after a day. Fears of instability spread to other South African mines .","NEW: Workers at another South African mine return to work .

"London, England (CNN) -- A proposed partnership between the French government and Google is stoking fears in France that the country's literary treasures will fall under commercial control of a U.S. technology company. Frederic Mitterand, the French minister of culture, has said that Google came to France with ""the attitude of a conqueror"" signing ""unacceptable"" and ""one-sided"" deals. He told Le Monde newspaper that the deals involved ""excessive confidentiality, impossible exclusivity and casual --even leonine --clauses on copyright."" For some, however, Mitterand's reaction is puzzling -- including one of the libraries concerned. Believing that access to their archives can promote French culture, the city of Lyon's library has signed an agreement with Google, hoping to scan as many as 500,000 books in 10 years. The first text uploaded online was a rare 16th century collection of doomsday predictions from the French philosopher Nostradamus. Under the Lyon Library contract, Google will scan its books and manuscripts for free. In exchange, the library gives Google the right to use the scanned documents commercially for the next 25 years. ""I find it normal and good that that book is scanned in Lyon where it was written. So I don't see the problem between using a method developed in the U.S. to promote heritage and culture in France or Europe. I don't understand the problem,"" Patrick Bazin, Director of the Lyon Library, told CNN. The library's collection includes national literary treasures and collectibles, such as a 16th century bible, in 12 languages. That means security is a top concern and Google is therefore keeping the location of its scanning secret. ""By putting them on the Internet, much larger circles of society, including non-specialists, can read these works and enjoy them and find them useful,"" Bazin added. ""They are works that touch upon all sorts of subjects of life, of the universe,"" he continued. ""They concern everyone and so they matter to everyone, and so they have to be made available to everyone by scanning them."" At the national level, officials like Mitterand have expressed a strong preference  to keep the digitizing an internal affair, and even develop a rival to Google. So far the government has earmarked $1 billion dollars to boost its own online database, known as Gallica. However, in January, an independent review for the French culture ministry criticized the lack of progress made by Gallica, and recommended a public-private partnership with Google. Since starting in 1997, Gallica has scanned less than one million documents and about 145,000 books, according to the UK's Financial Times newspaper. At the same time, the report concluded that deals between Google and libraries around Europe were disproportionately favorable for Google, and a better distribution would need to be brokered without the exclusivity clauses for France. Philippe Colombet, the head of Google Books in France, has said in the past that exclusivity was needed to guarantee a return on the investment of scanning, but that he welcomes a partnership with the state. In a statement emailed to CNN, Colombet reiterated ""Google's commitment to work more than ever in partnership with publishers and other actors in the book industry to help create a virtuous ecosystem for books in the digital era."" Currently Google has seven library partners in Europe, including Lyon. It is only scanning out-of-copyright works in Europe. While the final details remain to be hammered out, the pace of Google's process makes it hard to eschew. Google has already scanned more than 12 million books into its global index since the Google Books project launched at the Frankfurt Book Fair in 2004.","Fears in France that Google will have commercial control of national treasures .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Concerns about the effects of toxins emitted from burning trash at military installations in Iraq and Afghanistan have members of Congress demanding more tests and research. The U.S. military burns waste -- including medical waste -- in pits near an Air Force base in Iraq. The members of Congress want information from the military to see if there is statistical validity to complaints about illness and disease suffered by troops who served in those countries. The emissions, from what are known as ""burn pits,"" have been a concern for troops, especially those who served at Balad Air Force Base in Iraq. Many of the soldiers who went through Balad since the beginning of the war became used to ""Iraqi crud,"" as they dubbed the symptom of excessive coughing and black phlegm. Soldiers complained of respiratory problems and skin infections, and in some cases believe they developed leukemia and tumors from the exposure. The pits at Balad were at one point open and burning everything from plastics and food to medical waste. In later years, incinerators were installed at Balad, but many other bases in Iraq and Afghanistan still use the pits without incinerators to burn garbage. Various tests by the military concluded that emissions are not harmful. The military said smoke from the pit exposed troops to toxic emissions, including low levels of cancer-causing dioxins. But its tests indicate there is no long-term danger, officials said. ""The data indicate that there are no substances above a health threshold that should generate any long-term health risks, including cancer,"" Craig Postlewaite of the force readiness and health assurance office at the Department of Defense said. At the Pentagon's Force Health Protection Directorate, officials analyzed more than 160 air samples and concluded, in a soon to be released report, that the only risk is of temporary respiratory distress, nothing that poses a long-term threat. But many -- including some members of Congress -- remain unconvinced. ""After years of helping veterans of the Vietnam and Gulf wars cope with the health effects of toxic battlefields, we have learned that we must take exposures to toxins seriously to ensure that this generation of service members does not face the same difficulties,"" the congressmen say in the letter to be sent Monday to the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology. The letter, signed by six representatives including Rep. Tim Bishop, D-New York, asks for data from the military about tumor rates to see if a pattern of problems can be ascertained. CNN was given a copy of the letter in advance. ""We are collecting this data in order to help better understand what is happening to our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan,"" the letter explains. ""This would help to ensure specific benefits for service members who have been discharged from service if they become disabled because of certain diseases.""","Congress wants information to see if there is validity to illness, disease complaints .

"(Entertainment Weekly) -- For nine years, ""CSI"" star William Petersen has had it all. And that was exactly the problem. William Petersen says he's become ""too comfortable"" at ""CSI,"" and that it's time to go. ""The reason I'm leaving is because I'm afraid I'm becoming too comfortable,"" says Petersen. ""It's 'CSI' -- they pay me a lot of money, and I don't have to work very hard anymore. I've got it all figured out. And I just realized, God, as an artist, I'm going to atrophy. You do anything for nine years, it becomes somewhat rote. I didn't want to be on the show because they were paying me money and I liked the money. I didn't want to be on the show because it saved me from having to go look for other jobs. Just didn't want it. It was too safe for me at this point. So I needed to try and break that, and the way to do that, for me, is the theater."" So, with his final ""CSI"" episode scheduled to air Thursday on CBS, Petersen is saying goodbye to the show that made him very, very famous and very, very rich. He's now living in Chicago, where he's resumed a career as a theater actor. Leaving fame and fortune behind in the name of artistic integrity? There's a novel concept for Hollywood. But still, isn't he just a little sentimental about parting ways with a character that has defined him since 2000? ""I won't miss Grissom,"" says Petersen matter-of-factly. ""It was a complete life for me that's reached its end, and it's reached it in the right way, I think. So I won't miss Grissom. And I hope that the audience won't miss him either."" As a producer on the drama since its debut in 2000 and an exec producer since 2004, Petersen is one of the highest-paid actors on television (earning a reported $600,000 per episode). Over the years, he's watched his show turn into a ratings powerhouse and -- with syndication and spin-offs -- a veritable billion-dollar industry for CBS, which will no doubt feel the pain of Petersen's departure. Petersen has definitely left his mark on this crime scene. From the moment in 1999 when he persuaded creator Anthony E. Zuiker to change Gil's last name from Sheinbaum to Grissom, to the spring of 2007 when he began to map out his character's much-anticipated exit, Petersen has played a significant role in the direction of his hit show. ""The first day I met Billy, before filming the pilot, he said to me he wanted to re-create an ensemble feel of a theater company, to have that type of collaboration,"" says executive producer Carol Mendelsohn. ""It's not the easiest road to take, to have true collaboration."" However, she feels Petersen's insistence on teamwork ""has been an essential element to our success, on every level."" Petersen, who's unapologetic about his occasional my-way-or-the-highway antics, says he wanted a producer title to ensure that the cast and crew always had an advocate. ""Otherwise, it's completely unbalanced because everything is tilted toward the network and the studio and the writers. It can't just be generals. You have to have a few lieutenants. That's where I came in."" Naturally, then, it was Petersen -- and not producers or the network -- who decided when and where Grissom would finally step outside the yellow tape. ""For years, Billy had been saying he wanted to go, so we knew that one day he'd ask to be written out,"" says Mendelsohn. ""We had a game plan for a long time."" Petersen and the writers were set on hammering out an exit strategy that would seem organic to the world of forensic science. That's where the real-life Grissoms came into play. ""You talk to all of the CSIs we know, and they all have a short [career] life,"" says Petersen. ""They can do this for a while and then they all try to become techs (advisers) for our show! None of them want to go back down an alley and process fingerprints on a garbage can anymore."" The long goodbye officially began in November 2007, when Gil's fiancee Sara (Jorja Fox) fled Las Vegas for destinations unknown, and it continued with the tragic shooting death of Warrick (Gary Dourdan) in October of the following year. In fact, Petersen should have been gone by now: Warrick's death and Grissom's swan song were originally scheduled to air by last May, but the 100-day writers' strike shortened the season, so there wasn't enough time to tell all the stories Petersen wanted -- including the return of the Miniature Serial Killer and Melinda Clarke's dominatrix, Lady Heather. Postponing his farewell not only put some much-needed space between the high-profile exits of Fox and Dourdan, it also gave the show's creative team plenty of time to find Petersen's successor. After putting out feelers to an impressive roster of stars (Kurt Russell and John Malkovich were approached), the producers set their sights on Laurence Fishburne, who hasn't starred on TV since playing Cowboy Curtis on ""Pee-wee's Playhouse"" back in the '80s. While Fishburne is known on screen as a cool character, his first days on set last September -- as research pathologist--turned-college professor Dr. Raymond Langston -- revealed anxiety underneath that calm demeanor. ""CSI's"" Marg Helgenberger recalls how the 47-year-old actor rode his motorcycle to work on the first day and ended up clutching his helmet during a meeting with the writers. ""He said, 'I'm just gonna hang on to this because I'm kind of nervous,""' she remembers. ""It was really sweet. I think he feels the weight of the challenge of taking over that part. I mean, obviously it's not the same part as Gil, but that character was indelible and well-liked -- all that stuff that Billy was."" Adds Fishburne, ""Billy was the daddy of the whole thing and Daddy was leaving. Then in comes Uncle Fish. A lot of people didn't know what to expect."" When Petersen's final day of shooting arrived on October 10, about 200 members of the show's cast and crew assembled on the ""CSI"" soundstage to watch his character's last stroll through the dimly lit lab. Though everyone knew that Petersen wasn't gone forever -- he'll retain his producer title and he's promised to return for the occasional episode, though that probably won't occur until next season -- it didn't make his departure any less significant. Co-star Helgenberger can't even think about the ""painful"" day without tearing up. ""I couldn't stop crying,"" she says. ""It was hard. I'm having a hard time now, because, you know, we had a great nine years together. It's just over. It's the end of an era."" First things first, though: The man with the beard still has to take his final bow, though nobody's revealing how. But an even bigger cliff-hanger is what will happen to the show after he's gone. ""I'm sick he is leaving,"" says one EW.com poster named Betty. "" 'CSI' is Gil."" Jasmine puts it more bluntly: ""Once Grissom is gone from the original 'CSI,' so am I."" As he looks forward to the next chapter in his career, Petersen hopes viewers will adopt his attitude about Grissom's exit: no tears necessary. ""I think there's a way for the audience to remember him, like losing a great co-worker they've known for years,"" says the actor, who hasn't ruled out starring in another TV show -- someday. ""He didn't die in a plane crash, he didn't get a brain tumor. He's out there."" For Entertainment Weekly's complete cover story, and more information on ""CSI,"" click here.

"(CNN) -- Saudi Arabia this week turned back more than 1,000 Nigerian women pilgrims who were not accompanied by male guardians or ""mahram."" Saudi's Ministry of Pilgrimage (Hajj) released a statement on Friday defending its decision, saying that it will ""not allow the entry ... of those who don't comply with terms and requirements of the entry visa to Saudi Arabia to perform the Hajj."" Saudi law requires each female pilgrim under the age of 45 years to have a male sponsor during the pilgrimage journey, regardless of nationality. ""This rule is applied to all women in general who want to get an entry visa to Saudi Arabia to perform Hajj,"" pilgrimage ministry spokesman Hatim bin Hassan Qadhi said in the statement. So far, there has been no official explanation from Nigerian authorities on what might have happened. The last of the women arrived Friday night in Kano, Nigeria, after being stranded for four to five days at Jeddah's King Abdulaziz International Airport, Nigeria's state-run News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reported, quoting several women. ""This is the most dehumanizing situation I have ever experienced in my life,"" one arriving female, who did not want to be named, told NAN. Another woman, Binta Malami, said she traveled with her husband but was denied entry to Saudi Arabia because her husband's name did not correspond to the name written in her passport, the news agency said. Her husband decided to return with his wife in protest of an ""inhumane"" treatment. Saudi authorities denied any ill treatment. The Ministry of Hajj stressed in its statement that the Saudi government is keen ""on receiving the pilgrims from all over the world with ease and comfort in accordance with the applicable instructions."" Most international pilgrims arrive in Jeddah via air or sea, then make their way to the nearby mountainous city of Mecca to perform the Islamic pilgrimage rites. Nigeria started flying its citizens back home on Thursday after sending a delegation, led by speaker of the House of Representatives Alhaji Aminu Tambuwal, to discuss the incident with Saudi officials, NAN reported. Alhaji Hamman-Adama Tukur, one of the Nigerian clerics who helped the stranded women in Jeddah, told NAN that the women were actually accompanied by male escorts, but that the checking system at the Jeddah airport was such that men were checked, cleared and asked to proceed. ""When it was the women's turn to be checked and cleared, the security claimed they were not accompanied by their guardians -- mahram -- and were unwilling to listen to any explanation.'' Saudi officials normally separate men and women upon arrival as they check passports and paperwork. Islam requires every Muslim, who is capable physically and financially, to perform Hajj in Mecca, where the Saudi government says it receives almost 3 million pilgrims over a period of about 10 days every year.","Saudi authorities said women were not properly accompanied .

"Perugia, Italy (CNN) -- The trial for seven people accused of manslaughter in connection to an earthquake that killed more than 300 people in the Italian city of L'Aquila was pushed back Saturday to mid-October. The seven -- six scientists from the Italian National Institute of Geophysics and Vulcanology (INGV) and a member of the Civil Protection Agency -- were members of a governmental panel that prosecutors accuse of giving a ""rough, generic and ineffective assessment of the seismic risk"" before the earthquake struck in April 2009. The seven, members of a so-called ""major risks"" panel, published ""inaccurate, incomplete and contradictory information about the dangers of seismic activity undermining the protection of the population,"" prosecutors have said. The attorney for defendant Enzo Boschi, then-president of the INGV in Rome, told CNN Saturday that the defense had asked for a postponement of 20 days to study new documents and videos submitted by the prosecution. The court's next hearing was scheduled for October 15. Only two defendants, Bernardo De Bernardinis, then vice-director of the Civil Protection Agency, and Mauro Dolce, head of the seismic office at the agency, appeared in court Saturday. Professor Domenico Giardini, current president of the INGV, told CNN the trial was not about science but about the way information was communicated. ""Since people have died, it's necessary to give an answer to the question, 'could some of the deaths have been avoided?'"" he said. ""The trial is basically on that, on the number of weak points in the communication chain."" He said parallels could be drawn between what happened in L'Aquila and elsewhere in the world, such as Japan. ""We all have to work on new, and more clear, protocols, on the transfer of information,"" he said. His colleagues on trial were ""among the best scientists in the world,"" he added, but had taken on an extra responsibility by their presence on the major risks commission. The city of L'Aquila has requested 50 million euros ($68 million) in compensation over the quake. The Civil Protection Agency had organized a meeting of the major risks panel in L'Aquila on March 31, 2009, amid concern among the city's residents over ongoing seismic activity. After that meeting some members of the commission made reassuring statements to the press. Six days later, the magnitude-6.3 quake hit the city and surrounding areas, causing wide destruction and loss of life. The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) wrote to Italy's President Giorgio Napolitano in June last year to express ""concern"" over the indictment of its Italian colleagues. The American Geophysical Union (AGU) also published a statement last year in which it said the criminal charges brought against the seven accused were ""unfounded."" ""Despite decades of scientific research in Italy and in the rest of the world, it is not yet possible to accurately and consistently predict the timing, location, and magnitude of earthquakes before they occur,"" the AGU statement said. ""It is thus incorrect to assume that the L'Aquila earthquake should have been predicted. The charges may also harm international efforts to understand natural disasters and mitigate associated risk, because risk of litigation will discourage scientists and officials from advising their government or even working in the field of seismology and seismic risk assessment."" Journalist Livia Borghese contributed to this report.","A senior Italian scientist says the trial is about how information was relayed .

"(CNN) -- A car bomb exploded on a busy shopping street in the Northern Ireland town of Omagh 10 years ago Friday -- the single deadliest attack in the 30-year conflict between Roman Catholics and Protestants. A memorial has been built for the 29 people killed and 300 injured in the Omagh bombing. The blast killed 29 people, including a woman pregnant with twins, and wounded more than 300. It occurred at the tail-end of the bloody period known as the Troubles, which lasted from the late 1960s to late 1990s. It was also four months after the signing of the Good Friday peace accord -- which ushered in a new era in the region despite the continuation of some fighting. The 500-pound bomb struck on a busy summer Saturday when people were out shopping on the main street in the market town. The attackers called in a bomb threat but gave police the wrong location for the bomb, leading authorities to evacuate people from the center of town to the end of the street, right where the bomb went off.  Watch a family remember child killed in bombing » . Local authorities plan a 45-minute service Friday with prayers and singing to commemorate the anniversary. They plan a moment of silence at 3:10 p.m. (10:10 a.m. ET), the time the bomb exploded on August 15, 1998. ""All I can remember is going up. I went up and I came down and I hit something very, very hard,"" says Doreen Preston, who lost her right leg and two fingers of her right hand in the bombing. ""A soldier told me I hit the footpath. But as far as I was concerned, I thought I hit a telegraph pole 'cause all I could see was sparks and [the] smell of rubber."" Preston was working at Watterson's, a drapery and linen shop on the high street along with her best friend, Veda Short. They had worked together at the shop for 26 years, along with friends Geraldine Breslin and Anne McCombe. As police evacuated people from the area, the women were herded along with others to the spot where the bomb went off. Preston was the only one of the women to survive. ""I looked down and I could see Anne's skirt, and I thought, 'Oh, poor Anne's been injured, too,'"" Preston said. ""I thought, 'Where's the rest of the girls?' And they weren't -- I couldn't see anybody."" Preston spent more than four months in the hospital, at times so close to death that she planned the hymns for her own funeral, Preston said. She described anguish at learning her friends were killed. ""I miss them terribly,"" Preston said. ""Veda was like a sister to me."" The Real IRA, a dissident republican paramilitary group, claimed responsibility for the bombing. The Real IRA opposed the peace plan, which had the cooperation of the mainstream IRA, or Irish Republican Army. Only one man, Colm Murphy, was ever convicted in the bombing, but his conviction for plotting the attack was overturned and a retrial is pending. A second man, Sean Hoey, was brought to trial, but a judge ruled last December there was not enough evidence to convict him. Families of the victims have said they are angry that so many people who must have had a part in the bombing -- from the scouts and plotters to the bombmakers -- are still free.  Watch a survivor tell her story » . ""I think there is a lot more information,"" said Michael Gallagher, whose 19-year-old son Aiden was killed in the bombing. ""I think the intelligence services have not fully cooperated with the investigation."" Survivors have waged their own fight to get over the physical and emotional scars from that day. ""My father said, and I do believe his words, there's a time for you to be born into this world and a time for you to be taken out of it,"" said Preston, who has wondered why she was spared. ""That's quite true, 'cause it's [been] proved. 'Cause all those people round me were all taken and I was saved. But in saying that, it was a hard fight, a very hard fight.""","Omagh bombing killed 29 people, including a woman pregnant with twins .

"(CNN) -- More than 20,000 civilians were killed in the final months of Sri Lanka's civil war -- nearly three times previous estimates, The Times newspaper in Britain reported Friday. Refugees gather behind barbed wire at one of Sri Lanka's camps for those displaced by recent fighting. The Times said it had acquired confidential U.N. documents that record nearly 7,000 civilian deaths in the no-fire zone up to the end of April. The toll then surged, the paper quoted unidentified U.N. sources as saying, with an average of 1,000 civilians killed each day until May 19, when the government declared victory over the Tamil Tiger rebels. That means the final death toll is more than 20,000, The Times said. ""Higher,"" a U.N. source told the paper. ""Keep going."" The United Nations has previously said 7,000 civilians were killed in fighting between January and May. A top Sri Lankan official called the 20,000 figure unfounded. Gordon Weiss, a U.N. spokesman in Sri Lanka, told CNN that a large number of civilians were killed -- though he did not confirm the 20,000 figure. ""Up until a certain point, we had very good evidence to show that there were about 7,000 people that were killed,"" he said. ""Then the intense battle kicked in and there were many more deaths, but we didn't know exactly how many. ""Things went really bad"" after the battle began, Weiss said. ""After this, our sources were not able to go out and check those figures. It was based on an extrapolation from what we had seen in the past and also judging from the number of dead bodies that were brought into the hospital."" The declaration of victory by Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa brought an end to a 26-year civil war. The rebels began their fight for independence for the minority Tamils in July 1983, and since then, at least 70,000 people have died. The fighting intensified at the start of the year. Government troops managed to pin the rebels to a small strip of land in the country's north, a conflict zone that trapped thousands of civilians. Sri Lankan Foreign Secretary Palitha Kohona called the 20,000 figure ""absolutely unfounded, with no basis of fact."" He accused the newspaper of bias. ""The Times have been carrying on a campaign and has been using us,"" Kohona told CNN's Don Riddell. ""Sri Lanka succeeded in eliminating a deadly terrorist group and we also rescued 260,000 hostages, and now The Times wants to turn the clock back and make the allegations, which are unfounded."" Sri Lanka will investigate the number and causes of civilian deaths, Kohona said. ""This is a country where the rule of law prevails and these matters will come out into the open as things settle down,"" he added. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon visited some of the Sri Lankan refugee camps on Saturday and said they were ""by far the most appalling scenes I have seen.""","UK paper claims death toll in final months of Sri Lanka conflict more than 20,000 .

"(CNN) -- Operators of a South African gold mine fired 8,100 striking workers after they did not return to work. Some 15,000 workers at Gold Fields Limited's KDC East mine near Johannesburg had been participating in an on-again, off-again strike since August. Many workers returned to work this week, and the company said it fired those who did not return. The fired workers were given 24 hours -- until Wednesday evening -- to appeal the decision, company spokesman Sven Lunsche said. The line of workers wanting to appeal stretched for a kilometer. The workers at the Gold Fields mine had gone of strike to seek higher pay, the same as workers at several other South Africa mines. The firings at Gold Fields Limited mark the latest incident in a wave of sometimes-violent labor unrest that has wracked South Africa's mining sector -- the country's biggest industry -- for nearly two months. Another company, Anglo-American Platinum, fired about 12,000 striking workers who declined to attend disciplinary hearings last week after a three-week walkout. Four people were wounded during clashes between security officers and striking workers at a Gold One mine in September. And police fired on strikers at Lonmin's Marikana platinum mine in August, killing 34 workers and wounding dozens.","Workers at a Gold Fields Limited mine had been on strike since August .

"London (CNN) -- UK police charged a Polish man Tuesday in connection with the defacement over the weekend of a painting by famed artist Mark Rothko at a London museum. Wlodzimierz Umaniec, 26, will appear in a south London court Wednesday on one count of criminal damage in excess of Â£5,000 (about $8,000), London's Metropolitan Police said. The suspect, a Polish national who is also known as Vladimir Umanets, has no fixed address, police said. He was arrested late Monday in Worthing, on England's south coast. The painting -- part of Rothko's Seagram mural series -- was hanging at London's Tate Modern museum when a man began tagging the canvas with black paint Sunday afternoon. The alarm was raised and the museum was briefly evacuated. Rothko, a Russian-American abstract expressionist, was commissioned to do a series of paintings for the Four Seasons restaurant of the Seagram building in New York in 1958. Though he started the series of murals, he famously reneged, deciding the swanky New York restaurant wasn't an appropriate home for his art. Rothko rejected the commission but completed paintings stemming from the project, many of which made their way into the halls of museums. The murals arrived in London as Rothko killed himself in 1970 and have been on display at many of the Tate's locations, as well as the National Gallery of Art in Washington. CNN's Susannah Palk contributed to this report.","Wlodzimierz Umaniec will appear in court Wednesday charged with criminal damage .

"(CNN) -- When her baby girl takes an afternoon nap, or on those nights when she just can't sleep, Sarah Andrews, 32, tosses off her identity as a suburban stay-at-home mom and becomes something more exotic: a ""virtual deputy"" patrolling the U.S.-Mexico border. A Texas program lets Internet users around the world monitor live video from the Mexico border. From her house in a suburb of Rochester, New York, Andrews spends at least four hours a day watching a site called BlueServo.net. There, because of a $2 million grant from the state of Texas, anyone in the world can watch grainy live video scenes of cactuses, desert mountains and the Rio Grande along Texas' portion of the international border. When Andrews spots something she deems suspicious -- perhaps a fuzzy character moving from right to left across the screen or people wading through the river with what appear to be trash bags atop their heads -- she and the site's 43,000 registered users can send e-mail messages straight to local law enforcement, who then decide whether to act. ""Today, there's a couple vehicles that are parked side by side next to each other,"" she said by phone, her 7-month-old cooing in the background, ""but I can't tell what's going on, you know?""  See sample videos from BlueServo.net » . The video site's supporters see the 15-camera project as a stride forward in U.S. efforts to halt illegal immigration, drug smuggling and border violence. Run by the Texas Border Sheriff's Coalition, an association of 20 sheriffs from border counties, the project seeks to spread responsibility for the border's security across the nation's masses of Internet users. About 20 million people have clicked on BlueServo.net since it launched November 20, and the Web site has gained national attention at a time when many eyes already were focused on the southern border of the United States. Lawmakers are raising concerns about drug-related violence spilling into the United States from Mexico. And, bucking an upward trend, there has been an apparent decrease in illegal immigration into the United States because of the struggling economy, according to a report from the Department of Homeland Security.  Look at where the border wall is located » . The Bush administration made a number of attempts to curb illegal immigration from the south. The administration added troops to the area and also built a wall along parts of the U.S.-Mexico border, drawing criticism from environmentalists and immigration advocates. Now, a virtual community says it's trying to fill gaps in that protection. Rob Abernethy, a 42-year-old factory worker from Lincolnton, North Carolina, said he spends 30 minutes here and there watching the border out of a sense of civic responsibility. ""It may take the efforts of many to get a small result, but that small result could be rewarding or great in the long run,"" he said. But critics say the program tempts extremists to become involved in border security, which they say is a job better left to trained professionals. Although there have been no reports of vigilante groups using the site to make arrests, Texas state Sen. Eliot Shapleigh, a Democrat from El Paso, said the program is ""pandering to these groups to keep them politically engaged on this issue."" The program also has been widely criticized as ineffective in Texas newspaper editorials, as well as by some of the Web site's own users. Since the site was launched in late November, only four arrests can be attributed to the cameras, said Don Reay, executive director of the sheriffs' coalition, which runs the project with money from Texas Gov. Rick Perry's office. All of those arrests were related to marijuana trafficking, he said, with about 2,000 pounds of the drug seized. Those aren't the kind of results planners were looking for when they started the program, but Reay says the program's unseen value is in the fact that it prevents drug-related violence and trafficking. He said sheriffs along the border have seen decreased crime in recent months, partly because of the camera program, although he said he could not cite statistics to back up that claim. Perry's office said the cameras prevent crime because they don't ""allow the bad guys to op under the cloak of darkness anymore,"" according to Katherine Cesinger, Perry's spokeswoman. The cameras spy on stretches of the Texas-Mexico border where the border patrol isn't particularly active or where the border wall hasn't been constructed, Reay said. He declined to list locations of the cameras for security reasons but said most are hidden on existing structures on private properties. He wants the program to expand ""to cover every place where we don't have a fence"" and says the primary goal of the camera program is to fight crime, not immigration. There's no evidence that security cameras would deter people from crossing the border, said Stephen Legomsky, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, who specializes in immigration. ""If a person wants to come, they'll find a point at which they're willing to cross,"" he said, adding that studies show that more people are drowning and dying of dehydration in increasingly daring attempts to cross the border as security increases. Abernethy and Andrews, the two ""virtual deputies,"" said they would like to see greater transparency in the project. Both said they have e-mailed notes of suspicious activity to law enforcement, but neither has heard whether their alerts were of any help. ""It's interesting. You see different things on there, but I just -- I don't know that it's doing any good,"" said Andrews, the stay-at-home mom. ""I wonder if it's a waste of time."" She said she hopes her work as ""virtual deputy"" will prevent so many drugs from working their way north from Mexico into New York. She also said the site draws her interest because she's nosy about what's going on along Texas' 1,250-mile international border. Abernethy said he will continue to watch the cameras because he feels like he's part of an altruistic group of volunteers. Friends tease him about watching the site, he said. But he sees it as no worse than any other form of quick entertainment -- and maybe he can be of some help in the process. ""It's no different than watching 'Everybody Loves Raymond' reruns,"" he said. ""It's just something to do.""","BlueServo.net lets users watch live video from 15 cameras on Texas-Mexico border .

"(CNN) -- BATE Borisov stunned German giants Bayern Munich 3-1 Tuesday to continue their superb start to the Champions League group stages. The Belarusians won their opener against Lille and followed that up with a famous victory in their own stadium in Minsk. It was the first defeat after nine straight wins in all competitions for German league leaders Bayern and they were always on the back foot once Aleksandr Pavlov put the home side ahead after 23 minutes. Vitali Rodionov doubled the lead with 12 minutes remaining before Franck Ribery first struck the post then grabbed a 90th minute lifeline for the visitors. Brazilian Renan Bressan sealed a famous victory for BATE with a clinching third on the counter attack in the fifth minute of injury time. ""This is a sensational result for us, we will celebrate a bit but we need to keep working hard,"" BATE's ex-Arsenal star Aleksandr Hleb told AFP. ""Bayern are still favorites in our group, we are taking it one match at a time. In the other match in Group F, Valencia condemned Lille to their second straight defeat with a 2-0 win at the Mestella in Spain. Goals from Jonas in either half clinched the vital win for Valencia. An upset also looked possible when Manchester United trailed to minnows CFR Cluj in Romania through an early strike from Pantelis Kapetanos. But a pair of goals from Robin van Persie, both time assisted by Wayne Rooney, secured victory for Alex Ferguson's men. They top Group H with two wins, while FC Braga beat Galatasaray 2-0 in the other match played. Reigning champions Chelsea secured their first victory in Group E, beating Danish minnows FC Nordsjaelland 4-0 in Copenhagen. A Juan Mata goal just before half time was all that separated the two sides for much of the encounter and Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech made a superb save to touch a Joshua John shot on to the post after the break. But David Luiz rifled home a second from a free kick, Mata scored his second, and Ramires with the fourth put a gloss on the scoreline. Juventus, who held Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in their opener, had to come from behind to salvage a point against Shakhtar Donetsk in a 1-1 draw in Turin. Willian fed fellow Brazilian Alex Texeira to fire the Ukrainians ahead after 23 minutes. But Serie A champions Juventus preserved their 45-match unbeaten run when Leonardo Bonucci scored from Andrea Pirlo's corner just a minute later. Barcelona won the heavyweight clash in Benfica 2-0 to maintain their 100 per cent start to Group G. Alexis Sanchez put Barca ahead after only six minutes and midfielder Cesc Fabregas sealed three points in the Stadium of Light after the break. Their night was partially spoilt with two minutes to go when Sergio Busquets was shown red after a clash with Maxi Pereira. Scottish champions Celtic are giving chase on four points after a 3-2 away win over Spartak Moscow. Celtic went into the match in the Russian capital with a record of 11 straight losses on the road in the Champions League and 21 games without a win away from home. But an early goal from Gary Hooper gave Neil Lennon's men great encouragement. Spartak hit back to lead 2-1 after an Emmanuel Emmenike double, but home defender Juan Insaurralde was sent off just after the hour mark for pulling back Hooper. Celtic leveled when substitute James Forrest's shot found its way home via a rebound from defender Dmitri Kombarov.

"(CNN) -- The English Football Association has confirmed that England national manager Fabio Capello has resigned from his post with immediate effect. The decision comes following Wednesday's hour-long meeting between Capello and English Football Association chairman David Bernstein at Wembley Stadium. The meeting came after Capello openly criticized on Italian TV the English FA's decision to remove John Terry as England captain. Why is the England football team always in a crisis? Chelsea defender Terry is due to stand trial in July, after the Euro 2012 finals finish, on allegations of using racist language against QPR player Anton Ferdinand. In a statement on the FA's official website, Bernstein said: ""I would like to stress that during today's meeting and throughout his time as England manager, Fabio has conducted himself in an extremely professional manner. ""We have accepted Fabio's resignation, agreeing this is the right decision. We would like to thank Fabio for his work with the England team and wish him every success in the future."" Capello had already decided to leave the position after the Euro 2012 finals in Poland and Ukraine this June. However, England are now searching for a new manager ahead of the tournament, with Harry Redknapp the strong favorite to replace the 65-year-old Italian. In a bizarre twist of fate, the news came on the same day that Tottenham Hotspur manager Redknapp was acquitted of all charges of alleged tax evasion. Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere, who made his first England appearance under Capello, wrote on Twitter: ""Shocked about the news on Fabio Capello. ""He had shown great belief and trust in me, so I can only thank him. He was a massive influence on my career so far and I am sad to see him go."" And England striker Wayne Rooney also tweeted about the news, saying: ""Gutted Capello has quit. Good guy and top coach. Got to be English to replace him. Harry Redknapp for me."" England's next match is a friendly international against the Netherlands at Wembley on February 29. Capello's assistant Stuart Pearce, who also coaches the under-21 side and will lead the Great Britain Olympic team at London 2012, is expected to take charge on a caretaker basis.","Fabio Capello resigns as England national team manager with immediate effect .

"PORT WENTWORTH, Georgia (CNN) -- The bodies of four workers were discovered Friday in the ruins of a sugar refinery near Savannah, Georgia, that was gutted by a massive explosion and fire Thursday night, and at least four other people are missing, authorities said. The bodies, which were taken to a medical examiner's office, have not been identified. ""This is still a very fluid situation, there could be more [victims],"" said Sgt. Mike Wilson, a spokesman for the Savannah-Chatham Metropolitan Police Department. Earlier, a reporter asked him about reports that as many as 17 people might be missing. ""I don't want to speculate with a number right now,"" Wilson said. Dozens of people were injured, some critically, in the blast. Firefighters were making a second sweep through the plant in Port Wentworth to look for victims, but it was slow going, said Capt. Matt Stanley of the Savannah Fire Department. The plant has several hundred thousand square feet, and several floors had collapsed. The fire was under control, but not out, and there would be hot spots for days, Stanley said. More than 8 inches of water swamped the lower floors, Wilson said. He told reporters that plumbing pipes burst, and more water poured down when sprinkler systems were activated. The water was being pumped out, Stanley said. Stanley said it was possible that sugar dust from the refining process had ignited, sparking the blast.  Watch Stanley describe the inferno » . ""The managers of the refinery believe that it may have been sugar powder -- when that is aerosolized, it can get ionically charged and light off with just a bit of static electricity,"" Stanley said. ""It's very rare, but it can happen.""  See how sugar dust can turn into a fireball in an instant » . A company executive had no comment on the cause of the blast Friday. ""Our hearts go out to everybody who has been impacted by this,"" said John C. Sheptor, president and chief executive officer of Imperial Sugar, who was in the refinery at the time of the explosion. Workers began removing debris Friday morning, Savannah Police Chief Michael Berkow said. ""The structure is very unsafe to enter, and so what we are doing is starting to remove debris very carefully with the assistance of some structural engineers,"" Berkow said at a news conference attended by other officials.  Watch a rescuer describe how he used bolt cutters to prevent a possible second explosion » . He said support centers for families and friends have been set up at the hospitals where the injured were taken, and at the plant site. The refinery exploded Thursday night, and the blast was so powerful, it shook homes miles across the Savannah River in neighboring South Carolina. ""There was an explosion into the air with debris and a fireball that was probably five or six times as tall as the tallest trees here,"" said Lt. Alan Baker of the Port Wentworth Police Department. ""It's the biggest explosion I've ever seen in my life."" Investigators said they believe the disaster started in a room where workers bag sugar. Baker and his wife, Joyce, were at nearby City Hall when the blast ""shook the ground,"" he told CNN's ""American Morning."" Joyce Baker, who teaches first aid for the Red Cross, said she raced to the scene and pitched in. ""It was like walking into hell,"" she said. ""We had approximately 13 men who were coming out [of the plant], and they were burned -- third-degree burns on their upper bodies,"" she said. ""And they were trying to sit down, and the only thing that they wanted to know was where their friends were."" Sixty-two people were taken to Savannah-area hospitals, said Buzz Weiss, spokesman for the Georgia Emergency Management Agency.  Watch how the effort went from rescue to recovery » . Ambulances and emergency workers from 12 counties had been called in to help, Weiss said. Doctors were notified about the explosion at 8 p.m. and put together a response team that headed to Savannah Memorial Hospital, said Dr. Fred Mullins, medical director for Joseph M. Still Burn Center in Augusta. After evaluating the injured, 17 people with burns over more than 30 percent of their bodies were sent to Still Burn Center. The Medical College of Georgia received two patients, Mullins said. Eight patients have burns over 60 percent over their bodies, he added. Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue expressed his sympathy in a written statement Friday. ""Mary and I are deeply saddened by yesterday's devastating explosion that has shaken our coastal community,"" he said. ""I want the families of all of those lost, missing or injured to know that they are in our thoughts and prayers."" The U.S. Coast Guard closed the Savannah River around the port, and Coast Guard helicopters searched the water for people who may have been thrown by the blast. Flames burned overnight and spread from a main building to other parts of the refinery, Stanley said, describing the site as resembling a ""small war zone."" He said firefighters were trying to keep the fire from spreading to other parts of the facility where there are flammable materials. The Savannah Fire Department used a tugboat to pump water onto the blaze from the Savannah River. The refinery is the major employer in the riverside town just northwest of Savannah. In October, the U.S. Department of Labor issued new inspection guidelines for workplaces that handle combustible dust particles, including sugar dust. Plants where a lot of sugar dust is present are classified by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration as ""hazardous locations,"" the same classification as coal preparation plants and producers of plastics, medicines and fireworks, according to the OSHA Web site.

"(CNN) -- With the retirement of Justice John Paul Stevens, the United States Supreme Court loses a judge with an unusual ability to get the big things right by getting the little things right. Justice Stevens will be remembered for his stirring opinions in cases of great national significance. He also should be remembered for his equally compelling commitment to justice in scores of other decisions that received little public notice. In Hamdan v. Rumsfeld in 2006, Stevens wrote the majority opinion holding that even in the face of real threats of terror, the president must follow the law. The court declared that the Constitution reached into a military detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and offered the protection of the rule of law to the man who served as the driver for Osama bin Laden. For Stevens, no person was above the law, and no person was below the law. Stevens' passion for this ideal drew support from his experience as a clerk to Supreme Court Justice Wiley Rutledge. In 1946, the Supreme Court upheld the summary trial and the death sentence meted out by an American military tribunal to accused Japanese war criminal Tomoyuki Yamashita. Dissenting, Rutledge affirmed the importance of providing ""due process of law"" to all people, ""whether citizens, aliens, alien enemies or enemy belligerents."" In Hamdan, Stevens finally vindicated that principle 60 years later. For Stevens, that dedication to ensuring justice in all cases constituted the defining characteristic of a judge. In the 2000 presidential election decision, Bush v. Gore, Stevens penned a stinging dissent, castigating the majority for undermining the ""Nation's confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of the rule of law."" Stevens' commitment to the rule of law transcended partisan boundaries. In 1997, he spoke for the Court in Clinton v. Jones, finding that the Constitution did not shield President Clinton with immunity from civil suits. First appointed to the bench by President Nixon and then elevated to the high court by President Ford, Stevens was a Republican from a different era. His rulings fell out of favor with the ideology of that party. However, Stevens always remained a small-R republican. He detested the idea of a monarch who stood outside of the law. He often cited the English maxim, ""The King can do no wrong,"" to emphasize the foreignness of that concept of immunity in our republican form of government. Cases involving presidents are important, but rare. Stevens insisted on promoting the rule of law in all cases. When I think about Stevens, I think not only of Bush and Gore, of Clinton and Rumsfeld, but also of Vladimir Zatko and Jerome Hiersche. It is a bedrock principle of the American legal system that lack of wealth should not translate into a denial of justice. Accordingly, courts do not charge filing fees to those who cannot afford to pay. In the early 1990s, however, the Supreme Court deviated from that practice by barring access to people it deemed frequent filers of frivolous actions. The court refused to waive the fees for these litigants despite their poverty. When the court invoked the rule to bar access to one Vladimir Zatko, Stevens dissented. His opinion criticized the court for undermining its commitment to offering ""equal access to justice for both the rich and the poor."" The court continues to invoke the rule up to this day, and Stevens continues to dissent. And then there is the tragic case of Jerome Hiersche. The United States government hired Hiersche, a professional diver, to inspect a dam on the Columbia River. Government employees assured Hiersche that the water flow system would be shut off, but it was not. Hiersche's head was pulled into an opening in the system, and he was killed. The government denied all liability, citing language in a Supreme Court case interpreting an obscure provision of a 1928 statute. Stevens wrote separately to decry this result, imploring Congress to remedy the situation. He declared that ""this obsolete legislative remnant is nothing more than an engine of injustice."" In his lexicon, there was no stronger rebuke. The rule of law requires standing up to presidents, but it also demands standing up for the notorious and the nameless, the Hamdans and the Yamashitas, the Zatkos and the Hiersches. When one develops a habit of promoting justice in the obscure cases, the courage to demand justice in the notable cases follows. Justice Stevens pursued justice in all cases, great and small. The rule of law has lost an important champion on our nation's highest court. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Robert Schapiro.","Justice Stevens stood firmly for the rule of law, his former law clerk says .

"(CNN) -- This could go either way. You're reading this with a clear head and a satisfied feeling of having gotten a really good night's rest. Or, you're shaking your head and wondering why in the world you forgot to set your clock back and take advantage of that extra hour of sleep. That's right. Daylight saving time is over, and clocks adjusted back an hour at 2 a.m. Sunday . The change affects all those in the United States except for people in Hawaii and parts of Arizona who do not observe daylight saving time.

For those who do change the digits on their clocks, the sun will seem to come up earlier in the morning and set earlier at night, compared with Saturday. Daylight saving time may bring health problems . The idea for daylight saving came from legendary American inventor, statesman and founding father Ben Franklin, who, in a 1784 letter to a French journal, suggested that Parisians could save thousands of francs annually by waking up earlier in the summer so they wouldn't have to buy so many candles to light the evening hours.

The United States didn't adopt the practice until the 20th century -- for a brief time during World War I, again during World War II, and on a state-by-state basis in the years after the war. It became a national policy, with some tinkering, beginning in 1966. Dozens of other countries now observe some form of daylight saving as well.

"(CNN) -- Elizabeth Johnson -- whose 8-month-old baby, Gabriel, disappeared in 2009 after she allegedly took him to Texas -- was found guilty Thursday of unlawful imprisonment and custodial interference. Johnson also was originally charged with kidnapping, but the jury couldn't reach a verdict on that charge. Instead, the jury found her guilty with aggravating circumstances on the lesser charge of imprisonment and two custodial interference charges. Her next appearance in court will be November 1 when the judge will set a sentencing date. She has already served nearly three years in jail, having been taken into custody shortly after Gabriel disappeared. He was 8 months old when he was last spotted alive at a Texas motel in late 2009. What happened to him is unclear. Johnson originally told the boy's father that she had killed Gabriel, but after she was arrested, she told police that she gave the baby to an anonymous couple in San Antonio, CNN affiliate KPHO-TV reported. Police in San Antonio searched a landfill and found nothing. There also have been searches in Arizona and Florida, according to HLN, the sister network to CNN. The San Antonio police website lists Gabriel as a missing person. The mystery began December 17, 2009, after a judge awarded Johnson and Logan McQueary, the boy's father, joint custody of Gabriel. But Johnson allegedly defied the ruling and set out for Texas with her son. McQueary didn't hear from Johnson until several days later, when she reportedly sent him a text message saying she'd killed Gabriel and put his body in a Dumpster. ""I killed him,"" Johnson said in a text to McQueary on December 27, 2009. ""U will never see Gabriel again, I made sure of that. And you can spend the rest of ur pathetic life wondering about him."" The scathing series of texts continued. ""U will never find me im already bording a plane. Out of the country,"" Johnson said. ""When im safe ill email u the exact location of dead gabriels little blue body. If the garbage don't come first."" McQueary also recorded a phone call from Johnson in which she made similar claims. Johnson: ""You made me do this."" McQueary: ""You did not hurt Gabriel."" Johnson: ""Yes, I did. I suffocated him. .... I suffocated him and he turned blue. And I put him in his diaper bag and I put him in the trash can."" Johnson was arrested on December 30, 2009, in Miami Beach, Florida. She told police she gave Gabriel to a unknown couple under the direction of a woman named Tammi Smith. Johnson and Smith had met in June 2009, when both women were waiting for the same flight in the Indianapolis airport. Smith suggested to the young mother that she and her husband adopt Gabriel. Johnson said she called Smith that December to ask if the couple was still interested. In May, Smith was found guilty of forgery and conspiracy to interfere with Gabriel's custody. She was sentenced to probation and 30 days in jail. Smith's conviction does not relate to the boy's disappearance, but her efforts to conspire with Johnson to deny McQueary his rights to see his son. Smith told the court that she helped Johnson and helped care for Gabriel for nine days. Smith eventually apologized for any ""pain and suffering"" that helping Johnson may have caused, even as she firmly insisted that her intentions were good.","NEW: Jury adds aggravating circumstances provision to three convictions .

"(Financial Times) -- Chinese listed companies have reported a sharp rise in unpaid bills during the third quarter, in one of the clearest signs yet of the toll that China's economic slowdown is taking on corporate balance sheets. A Financial Times analysis revealed that 66 per cent of listed Chinese companies that have reported third-quarter results showed a year-on-year increase in such unpaid bills -- called accounts receivable in accounting -- as a proportion of sales, according to the S&P Capital IQ database. China's economy is on track to grow at less than 8 per cent this year, which would be its slowest in more than a decade. While that is still very fast by international standards, many companies have invested on the expectation of sustained double-digit growth and the sharp rise in accounts receivable is an indication of how even a mild slowdown has caught them off guard. The hardest hit companies are those linked to the construction and infrastructure sectors, including machinery makers, steel mills, coal and cement companies. Sany Heavy, the world's ninth-largest machinery maker by sales, reported that accounts receivables were up 83 per cent year to date at the end of the third quarter, hitting Rmb21bn. ""Due to the impact of the macroeconomic environment, sales repayments have seen some deferrals,"" the company said. Other machinery companies reported similar problems: at Shanghai-listed First Tractor, accounts receivable rose 169 per cent from the beginning of the year. At Zoomlion, a leading Chinese machinery maker, accounts receivable at the end of the third quarter were up 69 per cent from the beginning of the year, according to earnings released on Tuesday. Janet Zhang, economist at GaveKal Dragonomics said accounts receivable growth picked up in August and September. ""Some enterprises are reluctant to reduce production, so they continue to produce and sell things even when the buyers can't pay the money,"" Ms Zhang said. ""This is a big difference from 2008, when collapsing demand caused many enterprises to reduce production very significantly."" China's metals producers and coal miners have been particularly slow to cut production despite lacklustre demand for their products. At Baosteel and Jiangxi Copper, the biggest listed producers of steel and copper, unpaid bills rose 52 per cent and 66 per cent, respectively, since the beginning of the year. However, some optimists expect that the problem of unpaid bills could improve by the end of this year, as Beijing's small steps to encourage economic growth start to take effect. ""This might be a lagging indicator that will dissipate in coming quarters,"" said Frederic Neumann, an economist at HSBC. ""The financial situation has eased recently,"" he added, citing recently approved new infrastructure projects. Furthermore, for all the pain being felt by Chinese corporations, the country's banks are showing few outward signs of any credit trouble. At the end of the first half, the overall bad debt ratio for the banking sector was just 0.9 per cent, near an all-time low since the country's banks were recapitalised a decade ago. Of the big banks that have reported their third-quarter results, credit quality has actually improved. In quarter-on-quarter terms, non-performing loan ratios fell 0.5 basis points at China Construction Bank, 2bp at Agricultural Bank of China and 1.5bp at Bank of China. There has been a slight increase in overdue loans at most banks, however, and many analysts and investors believe that banks might be disguising a more serious deterioration in asset quality by moving bad loans off their balance sheets or simply rolling them over.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- At least 36 people have died after two passenger boats collided off Hong Kong's Lamma Island on Monday evening, throwing more than 100 people into the sea. The crash happened on a night when Hong Kong's busy waters were even more crowded than usual, as the city celebrated China's National Day. One of the vessels, owned by The Hong Kong Electric Company, was carrying company employees and their families to watch the scheduled fireworks display when it was struck by a passenger ferry traveling from Hong Kong Island to Lamma. Government officials said the collision occurred off Lamma's coast at around 8:20 p.m. local time. ""I thought we'd hit a rock or a lighthouse,"" said Chris Head, a school teacher who was on the passenger ferry that crashed into the Hong Kong Electric vessel. He said the force of the impact threw him out of his seat at the back of the ferry, which was not very full of people. As the damaged ferry began to move toward the pier in the small town of Yung Shue Wan on Lamma, Head said he could see the other boat had started to sink into the water vertically, like the Titanic. According to the Hong Kong Fire Services Department (FSD), which led the rescue, the vessel sank quickly after the impact. It said low visibility and many obstacles on board made it difficult for rescuers. The FSD said its rescue boats, including a diving support vessel, arrived on the scene at 8:41 p.m. local time and managed to pull 123 people from the water. Twenty-eight people were declared dead at the scene, and eight others were certified dead upon arrival at the hospital, according to a statement early Tuesday from the Hong Kong government. The survivors were taken to five hospitals around the city, with nine said to have serious injuries, the government statement added. ""After 10 minutes out a boat crashed into ours from the side at very high speed,"" one male survivor told the South China Morning Post. ""The rear of the ferry started to sink. I suddenly found myself deep under the sea. I swam hard and tried to grab a life buoy. I don't know where my two kids are."" Residents on Lamma reported being woken up in the middle of the night by the massive rescue operation going on offshore. On Tuesday, the front of the stricken vessel was still sticking out of the water, tethered to a big barge just a few hundred meters from Lamma. Police vessels surrounded the scene, and divers were conducting a search. The authorities have not ruled out the possibility that some people may still be inside the vessel or missing. The passenger ferry was able to dock safely. Government officials have not yet confirmed if passengers aboard that vessel were injured, but Head said nobody around him appeared to have been hurt. The narrow sea lanes leading into Hong Kong's main deepwater harbor are some of the busiest in Asia, with giant commercial freighters, ocean liners, passenger ferries and private boats of all sizes sharing the same waters. Hong Kong is home to more than 200 outlying Islands, including Lamma, which lies to the southwest of Hong Kong Island -- the city's financial center. Hong Kong Island is located to the south of Victoria harbor, with Kowloon forming its northern shores. To the north of Kowloon lie the New Territories, which stretch all the way to mainland China.

"(CNN) -- Is there a hidden war going on in the workplace between employees with children and employees without? In a recent New York Times article about flextime (""When the Work-Life Scales Are Unequal""), child-free workers are pitted against those who are parents, haggling over who does more work. Certainly, the tensions are real. But what this article and much popular debate around flextime misses is that when appropriately implemented, co-workers benefit from the greater contributions, not to mention healthier lifestyles, that flextime affords. It's time to move beyond overly simplistic analysis that sets people against each other at work. As an executive coach, adviser and confidante to senior executives across many industries, I've been working with this issue for more than 15 years and have heard all sides. Those without children will find many reasons to complain about work, including having to pick up slack for colleagues with children. But the reverse is true, too: While working parents are worrying about getting to their kids' activities, they complain about the preoccupation their child-free colleagues have with dating, their frequenting of happy hours, their unavailability to answer calls at night while they are out socializing and the unproductive mornings that follow as they try to shake their hangovers. In my experience, much of the tension among employees with children and those without children is caused by varying levels of availability. Who would think that parents with children are often more accessible and more reliable than those without? On a recent Friday at 5:15 p.m., I went to meet a friend at her Midtown Manhattan office, where she works as a psychologist at the Columbia University Medical Center. The office was practically empty. She and her colleague were the only therapists, out of 30, who were there after 5 p.m. They are among the few therapists on staff with toddlers at home. Just the night before, I met a client in Tribeca for dinner, a senior executive at JPMorganChase, no kids. She told me that she was taking this Friday off to spend more time with her parents in their country home. These are not the scenarios that generally come to mind when you think of stereotypical workers with and without children. That is because the flextime issue has long been framed as a zero sum game in which those with kids win and those without kids lose. This relies on old-school ways of thinking about how work gets done. If face time were the only measure of contributions in the workplace, then perhaps it would seem that child-free workers were left holding the bag. But it's not. Efficiency trumps face time almost every time in white collar jobs, and even a good portion of blue collar jobs. The majority of senior managers I have worked with tell me that parents learn time and people management skills that make them more effective managers at work. Because there is more at stake when one's paycheck is providing for many rather than one, there is a sense of urgency in keeping a job and being promoted rather than a sense of entitlement about perks and promotion. What the problem often comes down to is superficial appearances: It may look like working parents are getting a slide when they leave to take care of the family. And that is because working parents and child-free workers alike assume we need to disclose more than we really do. In these matters transparency is overrated. My recommendation is simple: don't ask, don't tell. When a worker has to leave the office, he or she should simply state, ""I have to leave at x time because I have an event/appointment/commitment."" The caveat here is that this only works for jobs that don't require physical presence in a particular location, in office cultures in which total contribution is measured and in workplaces in which employees are present and available to take calls 90% of the time between 9-5 and often beyond. Ultimately every company wants employees who look in the mirror each morning and ask, ""Am I working as smart as I can?"" At companies such as IDEO, a global design company, they've refined this model. On a tour of the company this summer, I learned that a typical new project launch commences with each team member describing their ideal work schedule, and the whole team is expected to morph into a schedule that goes partway to meet everyone's scheduling needs. Not only is this a successful model, but company's managers tells me they find that employees are more productive when they work out their customized schedules. They also remain at the company longer, accept lower compensation because of the benefits in work/life balance and have reduced tension with co-workers around issues of fairness in team contributions. Similarly, employees at the Chicago Web-app company 37 Signals are part of a results-focused and mostly virtual environment in which each person determines his or her schedule with consideration to teammates needs and is judged by the results. Whether it's toddlers or happy hours that motivate a worker's desire to work more flexibly, the reasons don't matter as long as the worker gets the job done. If we don't start taking a more enlightened and complex view when it comes to our feelings about co-workers, the conversation around flextime will quickly descend into blame and resentment, which ultimately affects not only morale and culture but also the bottom line. We need to flex our minds when we think about who partakes, who loses and who gains from workplace attitudes that allow for making judgments about co-workers not only at work but outside of work, too. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Alicia Bassuk.","Alicia Bassuk: Article reports tension between workers with children and those without .
She says it shouldn't be so; workplaces that value contribution over face time do better .

"(CNN) -- A confession: I usually have a knee-jerk reaction when television goes into its extreme-weather mode. All too often, I've seen the machinery clank into action -- team coverage, breathless anchors, intrepid correspondents getting soaked in the rain -- only to watch the heavily hyped storms peter out. What used to be the province of local eyewitless news, gearing up at the merest threat of thunderstorms or snowfall, long ago became a cable news specialty. It's a surefire way to goose the ratings. When I was in Tampa for the Republican convention in August, the saturation coverage of Hurricane Isaac helped force organizers to cancel the first night. Then Isaac turned out to be a bust, but the storm coverage continued to compete with the convention right up until Clint Eastwood argued with his chair. Hurricane Sandy was different. And I found myself grateful for the television coverage, as messy and chaotic as it often is. That is because the weaknesses of live, breaking news can sometimes be its strength. When news organizations jump the gun in reporting, for example, a Supreme Court decision, or an ailing person's death, it's hard to understand why they couldn't wait a few more minutes to get it right -- why the rush to get it first can trump all else. Watch: Why Do Crazy Reporters Stand Out in the Rain? But when a monster storm is devastating the East Coast, the fragmentary reports and incremental information are both riveting and necessary. Even a mistake becomes more understandable in this context. (A CNN meteorologist cited an erroneous posting from a National Weather Service bulletin board Monday night that the New York Stock Exchange was filled with three feet of water; the network quickly issued an on-air correction.) The correspondents braving the elements seemed less like grandstanders and more like dogged fact-finders. Each development -- ""Landfall near Atlantic City!"" ""Crane down in Manhattan!"" ""Flooding in Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel!"" -- became part of a shared community experience. At least for those who still had power. Watch: Is Hurricane Sandy's Dominant Coverage Hurting Mitt Romney? And that, even in this age of media fragmentation, may be cable TV's greatest service. We watch and experience the highs and lows together, even those in parts of the country that are unaffected. It is the polar opposite of a presidential campaign, with its relentless hyper-partisanship. In fact, by upending the final week of the campaign, the hurricane and the media attention surrounding it provided a uniquely unifying moment. Hurricane Hotties in D.C.: Still Stripping During Sandy . Social media played a key role as well. On Instagram, the photo-sharing app, users were posting 10 Sandy photos every second -- more than 244,000 tagged #sandy by Monday afternoon. No news organization could beat that. Twitter exploded with messages and updates about the hurricane, along with expressions of concern. For the 140-character generation, it was the online equivalent of gathering around the TV set in the pre-Internet days. But the vulnerability of social media, with its lack of editors or grownup supervision, was on display as well. The web, especially Tumblr and Twitter, also were flooded with fake photos -- stock images that had been altered or were misrepresented as having been taken during Sandy. One picture, carried by the Washington Post, Daily Beast and NPR, showed sentinels guarding the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier; it turned out to be have been taken last month. Editors at London's Guardian asked readers to help them spot the bogus shots by using the Twitter hashtag #FakeSandy. Watch: Many Americans Think Obama Is Jewish? Oy. Journalism, to be sure, is better at quick snapshots than long-term probing. Since the candidates have scarcely talked about climate change, it has almost disappeared from the media radar screen. But the violent storms of recent years -- the Snowmaggeddon, the derecho, now the most far-ranging hurricane in modern memory -- suggest that we have plunged into a new and more dangerous era. Reporters need to be more aggressive in examining the role of environmental change in these superstorms. I still think there is a tendency, in the wake of Katrina, to cast every storm as a potential Category 5 killer. But given the magnitude of Hurricane Sandy, which killed at least 33 people in the United States and knocked out power to more than 7.5 million, the media hype was more than justified. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Howard Kurtz.","Howard Kurtz: TV coverage of storms is sometimes overblown, designed to goose ratings .

He is Ahmad Abousamra, 31, a French-born dual citizen of the United States and Syria. Abousamra was indicted in 2009 after taking trips to Pakistan and Yemen. The bureau is offering a reward of up to $50,000 for information leading to his arrest. ""Knowing that the public is the FBI's best ally in finding fugitives, we're requesting their assistance to locate Ahmad Abousamra,"" said Richard DesLauriers, special agent in charge of the FBI's Boston division. The FBI said Abousamra allegedly attempted to get military training for the purpose of killing American soldiers overseas. It also said he traveled to Iraq with the hope of joining up with forces fighting against the United States. Read more: Family asks Ahmadinejad for help finding former FBI agent . A federal arrest warrant was issued for Abousamra after he was charged with conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists, providing material support to terrorists, conspiracy to kill in a foreign country, conspiracy, false statements, and aiding and abetting. Abousamra and a co-conspirator were charged in a superseding indictment in 2010 ""with an additional single count each of conspiring to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization, namely al Qaeda,"" the FBI said. DesLauriers said Abousamra is from Mansfield, Massachusetts, and left the United States in 2006. Abousamra is of Syrian descent. Agents think he might be living in Aleppo, Syria's largest city, with his wife, at least one child -- a daughter -- and extended family. Read more: Not one FBI Agent in Benghazi Embassy Crime Scene . The FBI launched a campaign on traditional media and social media such as Facebook and Twitter to garner tips about his whereabouts. The FBI also said it will use ""limited advertising on a social media site to reach an overseas demographic."" The FBI has posted on its website three head shots of a bearded Abousamra -- two from 2002 and another from 2004. The bureau says he is fluent in English and Arabic and has a college degree ""related to computer technology."" He had been employed at a telecommunications company. ""Conspiring to use force or violence to achieve a political or social goal violates our cherished ideal of peaceful dissent. Our goal is to find and arrest Abousamra so he can be tried by a jury of his peers,"" DesLauriers said. ""We believe publicizing Abousamra's photo and characteristics will lead to a tip about his whereabouts and, ultimately, to his arrest."" Abousamra's co-conspirator, Tarek Mehanna, was convicted by a federal jury last year on four terrorism charges and three charges related to providing false information to the government. He was sentenced to 17Â½ years in prison in April.","Ahmad Abousamra, 31, was indicted after trips to Pakistan and Yemen .

"New York (CNN) -- The New York City Marathon -- scheduled for Sunday -- was canceled Friday amid burgeoning criticism as the area recovers from the devastation wrought by Superstorm Sandy, city and race officials said. Mayor Michael Bloomberg had said earlier in the week the race would go on -- despite transportation, power and other issues -- contending, among other things, that businesses could use the economic boost the event provides. But on Friday, he and the race's organizer issued a joint statement saying they'd decided to cancel the race because they did ""not want a cloud to hang over the race or its participants."" ""While holding the race would not require diverting resources from the recovery effort, it is clear that it has become the source of controversy and division,"" the statement said. ""We cannot allow a controversy over an athletic event -- even one as meaningful as this -- to distract attention away from all the critically important work that is being done to recover from the storm and get our city back on track."" In the end, marathon didn't feel right . The announcement was widely applauded on social media with Twitter posts such as, ""Finally...Marathon Cancelled! After Days of Pressure, #Marathon Is Off."" In a Friday evening press conference, Deputy Mayor Howard Wolfson elaborated on the cancellation of an event he said is traditionally ""one of the very best days in the city, a moment of unity ... and joy."" Yet the growing criticism of the race weighed on officials, including the sense that some New Yorkers ""found the marathon -- the very idea of it -- to be painful."" ""It was clear that this was not going to be a celebration of New York. It was going to be a divisive, difficult day,"" Wolfson said. ""That's not what anybody wanted."" Mary Wittenberg, the CEO of the New York Road Runners, said one factor in the decision to nix this year's race was what she saw as an emerging ""animosity toward the runners."" ""We became concerned that ... no runner -- the best in the world or somebody hoping to finish -- was going to receive the welcome that we thought they'd receive,"" Wittenberg said. Officials have been meeting for days to discuss what to do about the marathon, with a number of options being considered. These included postponing the race a few weeks, altering the course, having a shorter 10-mile event, or even having a marathon just for the elite runners that had come to New York. Crippled NY subways spark infrastructure, climate questions . But Wittenberg said the decision was made to cancel this year's race entirely, cognizant of the real-life strains on volunteers and that many participants had planned everything around a November 4 race date. While there has been significant progress since Sandy, large swaths of the city remained without power Friday and public transit options remain limited. First held in 1970, the New York City Marathon attracts about 47,000 runners and 12,000 volunteers -- not to mention an estimated 2.5 million spectators who annually line the course, which goes through all five city boroughs. The race had been scheduled to begin Sunday morning on Staten Island, where runners would have crossed the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge into Brooklyn and run through Queens before crossing the 59th Street Bridge into Manhattan and the Bronx. But the 26.2-mile course does not include lower Manhattan, where heavy flooding left many neighborhoods in the dark. Even with the travel woes caused by Sandy, about 40,000 runners were expected to run this year's marathon, according to Wittenberg. In addition to promising them places in the 2013 race, she apologized to them for the cancellation. ""We are really sorry to the runners who have come from around the world,"" Wittenberg said. ""We ask for their patience and understanding."" Health risks after Sandy .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Dr. Gerhard Knies is the coordinator of TREC, the Trans-Mediterranean Renewable Energy Cooperation, a network of around 50 experts in renewable energies and sustainability. Gerhard Knies, co-founder and coordinator of TREC, a network that promotes renewable energies . When he retired from his research into particle physics in 2001, Knies was concerned that the planet's impending energy crisis was not being solved. ""I think it is insane to organize collective suicide and to participate in that,"" he told CNN. ""The fossil fuel system and our economy are doing that right now. We cannot survive in this way."" So rather than go fishing or head to the golf course, Knies decided to seek a solution. ""I thought, 'Are we so stupid? I'll see what options nature is giving us.'"" So in 2003, Knies co-founded TREC. The network, which has members from six European and ten Middle Eastern and North African countries, encourages countries to work together to harness the power of the sun to bring clean energy to the world -- and they think they've found a way to do it. TREC says that we could meet the entire world's energy needs by covering a fraction of the world's deserts -- just 0.5 percent -- with concentrated solar power plants. It is now working with governments and businesses to make this dream a reality. Knies is hopeful that soon the world will embrace solar power as the leading source of energy. ""My guess is that solar energy will be 40 to 70 percent of the total energy consumption, 30 to 60 years from now,"" he said. As part of his mission, Knies sees solar power as a tool to help poorer countries in North Africa. ""They would develop a new source of income if they could sell clean electricity to Europe,"" he told CNN. ""For Europe this would be one of the cheapest sources of clean electricity. It's a win-win situation between the two."" And he doesn't sound like a quiet retirement will tempt him away from TREC any time soon. ""I find it challenging and rewarding to work out ways into the future which are not harmful to us,"" he said. ""That's why I'm doing this and that's why I'm enjoying it."" ....................................... What do you think of Gerhard Knies's work?

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- ""This is ground control to Major Tom,"" sang David Bowie about a fictional astronaut lost in orbit in 1969. Now, 40 years later Bowie's son Duncan Jones has released his own space oddity. Sam Rockwell plays a moon worker nearing the end of his contract with Lunar Industries which mines precious gas, Helium-3. Jones' debut feature ""Moon"" is a thoughtful, stylish sci-fi thriller set in the near future amid the monochromatic wastelands of Earth's closest satellite. It is a contemplative character-driven piece of filmmaking that is particularly smart and accomplished because Jones has managed to create the film's universe with next to no money. But then, ""Moon"" isn't your average sci-fi: Stylistically, it's very different from the big budget, spectacle-driven science fiction being made by Hollywood studios today. With a storyline about alienation rather than aliens, this retro delight is peppered with references to 20-year-old classics like Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" and cult films like ""Outland,"" starring Sean Connery. It includes an inspired turn by Kevin Spacey as computer GERTY, whose automaton voice bears a creepy resemblance to HAL 9000, the ruthless computer in Stanley Kubrick's seminal space opera, ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" ""We wear our references on our sleeve,"" Jones, whose mother is David Bowie's first wife, Angela Bowie, told CNN. ""It is a period of science fiction we are both huge fans of and we miss that kind of film."" His partner and inspiration in this project is quirky actor Sam Rockwell who he was determined would take the lead in his debut feature. Rockwell plays Sam Bell, a moon worker nearing the end of his contract with Lunar Industries which mines Helium-3, the precious gas thought to be the solution to Earth's energy crisis. ""In some ways we worked backwards,"" says the 38-year-old who met Rockwell to discuss another film that didn't work out. ""The very first thing I knew was that Sam Rockwell was going to star. ""I knew I wanted to work with him because he's just so talented, and he also just happens to be such a nice guy. ""I said, 'Look, I really want to work with you. I really want you to be in my first film. Let me go away and write something for you.'"" The pair discovered a shared love of science fiction films from the late 1970s and early 1980s, like ""Silent Running"" starring Bruce Dern. ""Real, character-driven stories about working class, blue-collar people working and living in space,"" explains Jones. This was the seed of Jones' screenplay and the moon seemed the obvious place to set it. ""Everyone has a relationship with the moon but at the same time it remains so mysterious. We may have been there, but only briefly."" Nine months later Jones had worked up a script and, with his leading man secured, he had to come up with a plan for how to make a traditionally pricey sci-fi on a budget of $5 million. ""It was a challenge,"" Jones acknowledges. ""Science fiction by its nature is very expensive because you have to build everything; you have to build the entire universe that our film takes place in. ""If there's anything in shot, you're probably going to have to have it designed and built and then there's special effects on top of that."" To keep costs down, Jones used model miniatures for the exterior shots of the moon base and the lunar buggy that Bell drives across the cold regolith to tend to the monstrous Helium-3 harvesting machines traversing the planet. He shot the entire film in a studio and on a sound stage at Shepperton Studios, near London, England, which allowed them to completely control the environment. All of Jones' ideas in the film are based on what could be fact in the near future. Much of his inspiration came from a book by U.S. aerospace engineer and manned Mars exploration advocate, Robert Zubrin called ""Entering Space: Creating a Spacefaring Civilization."" One of the chapters in Zubrin's theoretical guide to expanding human settlement across the solar system was about setting up a Helium-3 mining facility on the moon. ""It always stuck in my head as a really interesting idea,"" says Jones. ""Hard science fiction, science fiction that builds out of scientific potential or extrapolating from what's possible -- that's the science fiction I find most interesting."" ""Moon"" was screened on request at the NASA Space Center, where they are doing research into Helium-3 mining. The researchers quizzed him on his moon base design choices and discussed their research, including ""mooncrete,"" a special concrete made of lunar rock and water from the moon's polar caps. Jones will continue to mine the rich seam of classic science fiction in his next film, ""Mute."" He has likened it to a Berlin-based version of ""Blade Runner,"" Ridley Scott's bleak vision of a future Los Angeles. He hopes to replicate the success of ""Moon"" which won Best New British Feature at this year's Edinburgh International Film Festival: ""What we're finding now is that there is a real interest and hunger for this kind of film.""","Duncan Jones aka Zowie Bowie wrote and directed debut feature, ""Moon""

"Washington (CNN) -- Apparently, Chris Christie didn't get the memo. ""Wednesday night is the restart of this campaign, and I think you're going to see those numbers start to move right back in the other direction,"" the Republican New Jersey governor said Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" Christie raises the bar for debate . Note to Gov. Christie: No, no, no, no, no. Standard operating procedure for pre-debate chatter is to lower expectations for your guy by raising expectations for the other guy. The way Mitt Romney's running mate, Paul Ryan, did on Fox: . ""President Obama is a very -- he's a very gifted speaker. ... The man's been on the national stage for many years, he's an experienced debater."" And because this is a bipartisanly accepted strategy, Obama's guy David Plouffe did it too: . ""We have expected all along that Gov. Romney will have a good night. He has prepared more than any candidate in history. And he has shown himself to be a very, very good debater through the years."" Obama campaign: Don't expect zingers . Further, governor, since you are supporting the candidate who is running behind (You are supporting him, right?), then you also need to lower the stakes for Wednesday's first of three presidential debates. As John McCain told me: ""Frankly, I can't remember the last time there was one of these comments that grabbed everybody's attention because, frankly, the candidates are too well-prepared. They're well-scripted."" What does Romney need to do to change the race? And as Ryan did (obviously he got the memo): . ""I don't think one event is going to make or break this campaign."" But definitely, Gov. Christie, definitely not the way you did: . ""And I'm telling you, Thursday morning, you're all going to be scratching your heads and saying, 'Wow, we have a barn-burner now for the next 33 days.' "" What questions would you like to ask the candidates? Share a short video question. Because the thing is, when you say that, Plouffe says stuff like this: . ""They expect to come out of this with the race fundamentally changed. Now, what does that mean? If it's going to fundamentally change, that means in seven or 10 days from now you'll see states like Ohio tied, the state of Iowa tied, because that's what really matters here."" You know what they say, governor -- there's no heavier burden than great expectations. On the other hand, you may be onto something: Actually believing (you do, right?) and saying out loud (which you did) that you think your guy will do great. Talk to you Thursday morning? -- CC .","Both sides have played low-expectations game about Wednesday's debate .

"(CNN) -- Mexico's foreign ministry has accused a U.S. Border Patrol agent of fatally shooting a Mexican citizen along the border. The shooting occurred Monday after agents in the area of Laredo, Texas, ""were subjected to rocks being thrown at them from the Mexican side of the Rio Grande River,"" the patrol's Laredo sector said Thursday. ""A weapon was discharged by Border Patrol. All appropriate authorities were notified and the shooting is under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation,"" the statement said. The U.S. statement did not specify whether a death occurred. Mexico's foreign ministry said a Mexican national died after being shot by a U.S. agent between Laredo and Nuevo Laredo, Mexico. The ministry did not release details about the circumstances surrounding the Monday violence. ""The Mexican government has repeatedly expressed that the disproportionate use of lethal force in the exercising of immigration control functions is unacceptable under any circumstance,"" the foreign ministry said Wednesday, calling for a thorough investigation. The Mexican foreign ministry released a similar statement in July, after it said that a U.S. Border Patrol agent had killed a Mexican citizen near the bridge between Matamoros, Mexico, and Brownsville, Texas.

"(CNN) -- Alex Ferguson has defended the Premier League referee at the center of a racism row, saying Chelsea's allegations are ""unthinkable."" Ferguson, one of football's most venerated and decorated figures, insists he does not believe claims that Mark Clattenburg used ""inappropriate language"" towards Chelsea's Nigerian midfielder John Obi Mikel during Manchester United's 3-2 win at Stamford Bridge on Sunday. While both the police and Football Association have launched an investigation into the alleged incident, Ferguson has stepped in to defend the match official, who has been stood down from duty pending the inquiries. ""I don't believe Mark Clattenburg would make any comments like that. I refuse to believe it,"" Ferguson told reporters ahead of United's game against Arsenal on Saturday. ""I think it is unthinkable in the modern climate. I just don't believe it -- simple as that. I've never had a player come to me in the last 15 years and say a referee swore in a game -- ever. ""The way we see the game today rather than how it was 25 years ago, it has completely changed.

Chelsea has already vowed to crack down on any acts of racism and Di Matteo insists the London club is determined to eradicate the problem. ""I always said that we are against any form of discrimination,"" he said. ""We will support anyone who is fighting that. That's our position and my personal belief as well.

"Atlanta (CNN) -- After a month-long investigation, Clark Atlanta University lifted a self-imposed suspension on the school's marching band after finding no evidence of hazing. The university announced August 30 that all performances of its Mighty Marching Panthers Band would be temporarily halted so the school could investigate allegations of hazing within its ranks. Clark Atlanta conducted an ""aggressive and thorough investigation"" and found there was ""neither hazing nor any illegal activity,"" the school said in a statement Tuesday. Allegations of misconduct within marching bands have garnered national attention after a hazing ritual resulted in the death of Florida A&M University drum major Robert Champion, 26, last November. FAMU's band director retired in the wake of the scandal and the school's president resigned. Champion, who was from Decatur, Georgia, just outside Atlanta, died after being beaten during a hazing ritual on a band bus after a FAMU football game. Both FAMU and Clark Atlanta are historically black colleges. Another, North Carolina Central University, suspended its marching band's drum line for two weeks in September after an investigation into allegations of hazing found that all members of the line had violated the school's code of conduct. According to the Herald-Sun newspaper in Durham, the school is ordering drum line members to attend a hazing prevention workshop and perform community service. And Texas Southern University suspended its ""Ocean of Soul"" band last week to investigate a possible hazing incident involving a section of the band.","Clark Atlanta University's band is back on the field, cleared of hazing allegations .

"(CNN) -- Days after the U.S. government announced upcoming trials for an H1N1 flu vaccine, Saint Louis University has been inundated with phone calls and e-mails from people volunteering for the study. Concern about the H1N1 virus grew after it spread quickly around the globe earlier this year. The university's Center for Vaccine Development has received more than 500 responses from potential volunteers since Wednesday, when the National Institutes of Health (NIH) announced human trials for a swine flu vaccine would begin in early August. ""This response has been exceptionally strong,"" Nancy Solomon, a spokeswoman for the university's medical center, told CNN Radio. ""We haven't had that strong of a response to our call for volunteers since we conducted our small pox vaccine research after September 11."" Thousands of Americans are currently being recruited for swine flu vaccine testing at several research centers across the country, including Saint Louis University's Center for Vaccine Development. ""The federal government comes to us when they need a quick response to test the safety and efficacy of vaccines,"" Solomon said. Other trial sites include the University of Maryland Medical Center in Baltimore; Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas; Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center; Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia; Group Health Cooperative in Seattle, Washington; The University of Iowa in Iowa City; and Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. They will be joined by Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Missouri; Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina; and IPS Research in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Most of the human trials are being funded by the National Institutes of Health. In an effort to deliver the vaccine to those who will need it most by October, the clinical trials will enroll as many as 1,000 adults and children, according to officials at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a division of the NIH, which will lead the effort. The trials will measure the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine. The research is a first step toward U.S. health officials' goal of developing a safe and effective vaccine against H1N1, also known as swine flu, which has been declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. After careful screening, volunteers will be inoculated and asked to keep a diary on how they feel. After eight days their blood will be checked. After 21 days they will receive another dose, followed again by diary logs and blood tests. Patients will be monitored two months for safety issues, followed by a four-month and six-month checkup. ""The purpose of these trials is always to make sure they are safe,"" said Dr. Karen Kotloff, professor of pediatrics and lead investigator and researcher at Maryland's Center for Vaccine Development. ""But even after six weeks, if things look good, we're pretty sure the vaccine will work."" At last count, the CDC said there are 43,771 H1N1 reported cases in the U.S., along with 302 deaths that have been linked to the illness. In a normal flu season, about 36,000 Americans die from influenza and related complications. Models predict the 2009 H1N1 flu will peak in October, with many cases being diagnosed in September, according to Dr. Robert Belshe, director of Saint Louis University's Center for Vaccine Development. ""We'll be in the midst of it before we know it,"" Belshe said. Swine flu could sicken one in five people this fall, and Belshe said he worries that the number of serious health complications and deaths as a result of the H1N1 virus could soar. ""It's looking more and more like we're going to have a big flu outbreak this fall as soon as the kids get back to school,"" Belshe told CNN Radio. ""Influenza is unpredictable, but I believe this pandemic will hit pre-teens, teens and their parents hard, and as many as 60 million Americans could be sick with the flu. It's critical that we find a way to protect people from this disease.""
