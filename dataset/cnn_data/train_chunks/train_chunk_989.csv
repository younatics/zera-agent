"Saido Berahino scored twice for West Brom playing up front on his own. To see his heat map and more from our brilliant match zone, click here . The scale of West Bromwich Albion’s success in finding three wins in eight days can be measured by the changing chants from the Hawthorns stands. Head coach Alan Irvine was asked for a wave and captain Chris Brunt heard his name sung. During their previous Premier League home match — a defeat by Everton — Irvine was booed and Brunt jeered. Since then, however, Tottenham and Hull have been defeated and this rout, the club’s biggest win since February 2012, boosted the feelgood factor as much as their league position. True, Burnley provided weak opposition but some of West Brom’s attacking play, spearheaded by Saido Berahino, suggested the good times can continue. Saido Berahino (second right) nods the ball home for West Brom's second goal . Berahino slides the ball past Tom Heaton 11 minutes into the second half to seal the victory for West Brom . West Brom (4-2-3-1): Foster 6.5; Wisdom 7, Dawson 7.5, Lescott 7.5, Pocognoli 7.5 (Gamboa 83min); Gardner 6.5 (Yacob 87), Morrison 7; Dorrans 7.5, Sessegnon 7 (Samaras 74, 6), Brunt 7.5; Berahino 8. Subs not used: Myhill, Mulumbu, McAuley, Blanco . Booked: Dorrans . Manager: Alan Irvine 7.5 . Burnley (4-1-4-1): Heaton 6; Trippier 6, Duff 5, Shackell 5, Mee 5; Reid 4.5 (Chalobah 46, 5); Wallace 5 (Barnes 46, 5); Arfield 6, Boyd 5.5, Kightly 5.5; Jutkiewicz 6 (Sordell 68, 5.5) Subs not used: Gilks, Ward, Keane, Long . Booked: Chalobah, Mee . Manager: Sean Dyche 5.5 . Man of the match: Saido Berahino . Referee: Jon Moss 6. This was the first time since November 2012 that Albion have recorded three consecutive victories in all competitions and they leapt from 17th place to 10th in one afternoon. Berahino scored twice to become the leading English marksman in the top flight with four goals and back up his pre-match claim that to win senior international honours is not an unrealistic ambition. With Roy Hodgson’s assistant Ray Lewington and England coach Gary Neville in the stands it is feasible the 21-year-old could be given a call-up for next month’s European qualifiers — particularly with Daniel Sturridge recovering from injury and Rickie Lambert faltering. England manager Hodgson knows Berahino from his time at West Brom. ‘If he keeps on playing like that he’ll get all those rewards,’ said Irvine. ‘I don’t think Roy will be looking and saying he’s too young but right now Saido has just got to keep working as he does.’ Berahino, with eight goals in 11 games for England Under 21s, nodded in from two yards on the stroke of half-time to make it 2-0 and then applied a precise finish 11 minutes after the interval. Craig Dawson had opened the scoring in the 31st minute and Graham Dorrans grabbed the goal his performance deserved with a clinical shot in the final minute. ‘We won’t get carried away,’ said Berahino. ‘We will focus and go to Liverpool (on Saturday) and make sure we get something there.’ For Burnley the worry is they have added defensively fragility to their limited offensive capabilities. This was their fifth Premier League game in a row without scoring, making it 526 minutes since Scott Arfield hit their only goal of the season against Chelsea. Three points had been accrued via goalless draws to give Sean Dyche’s side the joint best defensive record in the division alongside Southampton going into this match. But their resistance crumbled spectacularly here. ‘That’s a massive learning curve,’ said Dyche, shorn of his usual midfield through injuries to David Jones and Dean Marney. ‘We were carrying too many players today.’ Burnley’s poor scoring record must be a huge concern. ‘That needs to be dealt with,’ he said. ‘Players get that weird feeling, “When are we going to score?” ‘One of the big mantras I say to the players is, “Be the man who makes a difference”.’ Craig Dawson snuffs out the danger of Burnley's George Boyd and shepherds the ball out of play in the first couple of minutes .

Dawson got the ball rolling, scoring against the club who tried three times to buy him in the summer. The defender should be glad his transfer request was rejected. Dawson rose higher than Jason Shackell to head in Brunt’s corner for his first West Brom goal. Albion’s second came from the same source, although this time James Morrison delivered the corner, Dorrans flicked on and Berahino applied the final nod. Then Berahino got his second with a neat finish across Tom Heaton and though Burnley tried to claw their way back into the game, West Brom keeper Ben Foster did well to save from Lukas Jutkiewicz. West Brom supporters have taken to serenading their head coach with the chant, ‘Alan ****ing Irvine’, and did so again as the football flowed. ‘I’ve probably been called that a few times but not so much in that context,’ said the Glaswegian with a smile. He hopes the fans keep having cause to turn the air blue with joy. Berahino (second right) looks at the ball as it nestles in the corner for West Brom's second goal .

"Andy Murray’s sponsors Standard Life, who backed the No campaign before the Scottish independence referendum, have demonstrated there is no rift with the tennis star over his nationalist views by block-booking his hotel for the Ryder Cup. The financial services giants are taking over the 15-bedroom Cromlix Hotel during the golf tournament, in which they are also major partners. The luxury hotel, which Murray bought for £1.8million last year, is three miles from his home town of Dunblane and just 12 miles from Gleneagles. The five marquee suites are named after famous Scots including Robert the Bruce and, inevitably, Sir Alex Ferguson. Andy Murray's sponsors Standard Life have block-booked into his 15-bedroom Cromix Hotel . Standard Life signed a contract to be Murray’s shirt patch sponsor before Wimbledon last June in a deal worth around £4.5m over three years. But relations could have soured after Murray unnecessarily made a late-night tweet backing the Yes vote. This was bound to alienate Standard Life, who have their HQ in Edinburgh. The group had said they would relocate some of their business to England if Scotland voted for independence. A small number of fake Ryder Cup tickets bought online have been uncovered, with tournament authorities urging spectators to check the validity of their passes at www.ticketcheck.rydercupeurope.com. Spectators found with tickets bought from unauthorised sellers will be refused entry — as happened at Celtic Manor to hospitality clients of secretive Ipswich owner Marcus Evans. A spokesman for Evans said they had provided hospitality near the course but not tickets. Lee Westwood’s caddie Billy Foster is playing the joker even if the humour is basic. Billy broke off from the team photoshoot and moved a safe distance away, then dropped his shorts to moon at the long-lens cameras. Lee Westwood's caddie Billy Foster (above) dropped his shorts during the team photoshoot . There is no love lost between rival watch brands Rolex and Omega, especially since Omega replaced Rolex as official Ryder Cup timekeepers for the USA. However, compared to the European players’ gifts of £7,500 Rolexes this week, the Omega Seamaster Aqua Terra 15,000 Gauss received by the US team might even meet the FIFA ethics code for ‘trivial or symbolic’ gifts with its mere £4,170 price tag. Fergie’s Irish fall-out . Paul McGinley revealed he first met Sir Alex Ferguson, who gave a speech to the European team on Tuesday night, at a JP McManus Pro-Am 15 years ago. That certainly wouldn’t happen now following Fergie’s seismic split with McManus and fellow Irish racing tycoon John Magnier over the breeding rights to Rock Of Gibraltar. McManus has close friends at the European Tour who are regularly guests in his hospitality box at Cheltenham. But don’t tell Fergie. Meanwhile, US Ryder Cup captain Tom Watson showed the first sign of tetchiness when asked if the States had a comparable speaker to Sir Alex. Watson glibly replied ‘me’ and wouldn’t say who else might be invited into the team room. Paul McGinley (left) first met Sir Alex Ferguson at a JP McManus Pro-Am 15 years ago . Combative Beeb insider Dan Roan is expected to be promoted to BBC sports editor after a bizarre selection process in which short-listed newspaper journalists were discarded without even a screen test. FIFA event managers Byrom, who had an awful World Cup with their executive Ray Whelan arrested over the illegal selling of tickets, have had a lousy start to the Ryder Cup, too. Byrom’s organising of Ryder Cup transport was so shambolic yesterday that some coach drivers didn’t even know the route from Glasgow to Gleneagles. One clueless driver took wrong turns three times. Byrom passed the buck to the bus sub-contractors. Ancient rockers Chicago going through most of their back catalogue at the 2012 Ryder Cup gala concert annoyed the European team, who were left hanging around before being introduced. This time Europe have ensured a set time in the concert for the golfers to be paraded at Glasgow’s Hydro Arena.

"It seemed quite appropriate that a year to the day since Saido Berahino announced his ability to the Premier League with a winner at Old Trafford, he scored a double that just might earn him an England call-up. Those 365 days have encompassed an awful lot for this 21-year-old who is still learning and improving, both on and off the pitch. They include eight goals for Gareth Southgate’s Under 21 side but also the moment he was allegedly punched by James Morrison in a dressing-room dust-up, and the time he was filmed inhaling potentially dangerous laughing gas through a balloon. West Brom striker Saido Berahino could earn a call-up to the senior England squad . It looked like he might leave the club he has called home since the age of 11 in the aftermath of those events but instead he has buckled down and is now reaping the rewards. There is dedication in his training, often staying behind after sessions to work on his game, and his fitness has improved – aided by a personal trainer. This season he has emerged the striker to whom Alan Irvine can hand responsibility of leading the line, with £10million Brown Ideye and Victor Anichebe struggling with injuries. Berahino was in devastating fashion as West Brom thrashed Burnley 4-0 in the Premier League . The striker scored twice in the Baggies' convincing win at the Hawthorns on Sunday . Berahino celebrates scoring West Brom's winner in their 2-1 win against Manchester United last season . England boss Roy Hodgson knows Berahino from his time in charge of West Brom . Saido Berahino boasts a better goals per game ratio than all the other English strikers playing in the Premier League this season. Berahino - 4 goals in 6 games (0.67) Wayne Rooney - 3 goals in 6 games (0.50) Charlie Austin - 2 goals in 5 games (0.40) Gabby Agbonlahor - 2 goals in 6 games (0.33) Frazier Campbell - 2 goals in 6 games (0.33) Daniel Sturridge - 1 goal in 3 games (0.33) Carlton Cole - 1 goal in 4 games (0.25) Jamie Vardy - 1 goal in 4 games (0.25) Dwight Gayle - 1 goal in 4 games (0.25) Peter Crouch - 1 goal in 5 games (0.20) Danny Welbeck - 1 goal in 5 games (0.20) David Nugent - 1 goal in 6 games (0.17) Berahino scored two on the opening day against Sunderland, came off the bench to snatch a dramatic late win over Hull in the Capital One Cup, and produced his most complete performance to date with two against Burnley. He peeled away from his marker at Morrison’s corner so was able to nod in at to the far post when Graham Dorrans got the flick on for his first goal. And then he curved his run to stay onside to receive Dorrans’ pass and strike a sweet first-time finish for his second. ‘His movement for such a young player is very good,’ said head coach Irvine. ‘He was a wee bit frustrated at half-time because he felt that he had made runs and things hadn't quite come off. ‘I just said to him, as a striker, if you are going to score goals, you are going to have to make a lot of runs for that one that actually all comes together. West Brom boss Alan Irvine has praised Berahino's work ethic and his desire to improve as a footballer . ‘Fortunately, he got that when it came through to him just right and his finish was great. He can finish with both feet. ‘He's a great professional. I know people have talked about problems in the past, I haven't seen a moment of that. He's been a pleasure to work with, he's got a great future. ‘Saido works on his game every single day, he stays to do finishing and movement after training has finished and he's getting his rewards for that.’ Berahino scored the winner on his England Under-21 debut against Moldova in September 2013 . On September 28, 2013, Berahino struck the goal that condemned Manchester United to a shock defeat, just 23 days after marking his England Under 21 debut with the winner against Moldova. Steve Clarke had brought Berahino into the first-team but was dismissed less than two months later and that affected him. ‘I kind of lost myself,’ Berahino revealed last week. His form stuttered under caretaker Keith Downing and Spaniard Pepe Mel, who played him to varying degrees, although he did finish the club’s top scorer with nine goals in all competitions. Irvine seems to have helped re-energise Berahino, who arrived in Birmingham aged 10 as a refugee having fled Burundi during the civil war that claimed the life of his father. Berahino (right) struggled for form following the dismissal of Steve Clarke as Baggies boss last term . Berahino finished as West Brom's top goalscorer last season, with nine goals in all competitions . He has overcome that hardship but it shapes who he is, and explains the drive he brings to his profession. England coaches Ray Lewington and Gary Neville were in the stands at The Hawthorns to witness his destruction of Burnley and Roy Hodgson knows the player from his time at West Brom. With Daniel Sturridge still to recover from injury and Rickie Lambert yet to find the net for Liverpool, there is potential for Berahino to receive senior honours quicker than expected. There are two European qualifiers against San Marino and Estonia in the coming fortnight and time could be opportune to test his mettle. He is the leading English scorer in the Premier League so far. ‘That will certainly make Roy think,’ smiled Irvine.

"David Luiz splits opinion among many in football and it appears Roy Hodgson isn't his biggest fan too following reports in France. The Brazil international became the most expensive defender in  history this summer following his £50million switch to French giants Paris Saint-Germain from Chelsea. The 27-year-old signed a five-year deal at the Parc des Princes and according to French publication L'Equipe the England boss questioned PSG's decision to sign the centre-back. England boss Roy Hodgson has questioned PSG's £50million signing of David Luiz, according to reports . Luiz (left) became the most expensive defender in history following his summer switch from Chelsea . Hodgson's alleged comments come in a meeting including PSG boss Laurent Blanc this summer . In a meeting with PSG president and owner Nasser Al Khelaifi, along with manager Laurent Blanc during the summer, Hodgson is reported to have been quizzical over the transfer. ‘But how could your club take David Luiz? He makes at least one error in concentration a game! £50m is crazy,’ the 67-year-old is quoted as saying. Luiz endured a torrid end to his World Cup with the host nation Brazil at this summer's showpiece - captaining his country as they suffered an embarrassing 7-0 defeat in the semi-finals to eventual winners Germany. Luiz was roundly criticised for his display as Brazil were thumped 7-0 by Germany in the World Cup semis . The former Chelsea defender's display in that match saw him earn a lot of criticism which was further compounded by the five-time tournament winners 3-0 capitulation against Holland in the third-place play-off encounter. Since moving to the French capital though, Luiz has enjoyed a relatively smooth start with his new club keeping four clean sheets in the seven games he has featured in all competitions. 27-year-old (centre) has kept four clean sheets in his seven PSG starts so far .","Roy Hodgson has questioned PSG's signing of David Luiz, according to reports in France .

"When footballers surrender the habit of doing even the basics right, you know a team is in trouble. By that rationale, Newcastle United and manager Alan Pardew would appear to be in very deep trouble indeed. This was not a performance to place alongside the capitulation at Southampton just over a fortnight ago. It may be a while before we see the like of that again. At times last night Newcastle kept the ball and spent time in Stoke City’s half. They created half-chances. Right at the death, they could even have equalised. How Jack Colback lifted the ball on to the crossbar from only six yards perhaps even he doesn’t know. Stoke striker Peter Crouch rises above the Newcastle defence to direct a header into the net . Peter Crouch celebrates his early strike against Newcastle on Monday night . STOKE CITY: (4-2-3-1): Begovic 6; Bardsley 6, Shawcross 6.5, Wilson 6.5, Muniesa 7; Whelan 6, Nzonzi 6.5; Diouf 5.5 (Arnautovic 23mins 6.5), Adam 6.5 (Ireland 60mins 6), Moses 6.5 (Assaidi 81mins 5.5); Crouch 6.5 . GOALS: Crouch 16 . BOOKED: Bardsley . NEWCASTLE UNITED (4-2-3-1): Krul 6; Janmaat 4.5, Williamson 5, Coloccini 5, Dummet 6; Colback 6, Tiote 5.5; Sissoko 5, Cabella 5 (Ameobi 74mins 6), Gouffran 5 (Obertan 67mins 6); Riviere 5 (Cisse 45mins 6). BOOKED: Colback . REFEREE: Craig Pawson 6.5 . MAN OF THE MATCH: Victor Moses . One of the big giveaways when you watch bad teams, though, is how easily they concede possession and what they do when they don’t have the ball. On both those scores, Newcastle were utterly wretched again last night. Peter Crouch’s winning goal in the first half was a fine header. It happened because Newcastle made weak challenges and showed a lack of commitment in the air. Subsequently, Stoke capitalised on careless Newcastle passing to break regularly on Tim Krul’s goal. At times forward Victor Moses must have felt he was participating in some kind of training drill. Speaking on the BBC, pundit Phil Neville summed it up beautifully. ‘Every time Newcastle have a set piece, you feel that Stoke are going to break away and score,’ said Neville. Had Stoke been more ruthless they would have buried Newcastle, but the fall-out is the same — the visitors stay joint bottom and poor Pardew slips closer to the unemployment line. How much longer the Newcastle manager’s misery will go on, only owner Mike Ashley can be aware. What is beyond doubt is that Pardew’s travails are painful to watch. His employer seems not to care for him, his players have forgotten how to play for him and his club’s supporters — or at least a huge portion of them — have had enough of him. Last night, this result had an air of inevitably about it. So bad had Newcastle been at Southampton that nobody blinked when Crouch headed Stoke into the lead after quarter of an hour.

Newcastle had actually been marginally the better team until then. In an instant, though, Stoke broke to score and the tone of the game was set. It was a fine goal from Stoke’s point of view. The cross from the left by the lively Moses was a good one and Crouch’s leap was impressive as he headed the ball past Krul from ten yards. From a Newcastle point of view, though, there was culpability everywhere. Right back Daryl Janmaat had two opportunities to tackle Moses before the cross arrived but was simply too weak or perhaps lacking in zeal.

Paul Dummett      90            11.2        6.9 . When Moses did deliver, Newcastle captain Fabricio Coloccini utterly failed to compete in the air with Crouch. The Stoke player was able to rise a good six inches above his marker and that made scoring the goal much simpler. It was a dreadful moment for Newcastle and one wondered how bad it would get from that point. Indeed, had referee Craig Pawson spotted Yoan Gouffran’s foul on Moses in the penalty area soon after, the contest may have been over by the time the first-half rain had stopped. Pardew’s team lacks discipline and suffers from lapses in concentration. It is a deadly combination and almost undid them on two or three more occasions before the interval. Had Stoke made some better decisions of their own they would have profited but the closest they came was when Crouch applied a poor touch to a Moses pass and shot wide. Substitute Marko Arnautovic then drove a low effort against Newcastle defender Paul Dummett. At the other end, Stoke goalkeeper Asmir Begovic saved low from Janmaat as half time approached but the other side of the interval brought little change in the overall pattern. Arnautovic was unfortunate to see a right-foot shot cannon off the far post in the 48th minute while Moses should have done better than allow Krul to block when two Newcastle defenders fell over each other to gift him a chance on the hour. Stoke’s profligacy subsequently kept Newcastle in the game and Colback could have snatched something when Gabriel Obertan’s cross reached him at the death. All he could manage, though, was to snatch at the chance and it was typical of Newcastle’s night. As he left the field, Pardew applauded the Newcastle fans. They did not respond in kind.

"Rio Ferdinand is being considered as the FA’s candidate for British vice-president on FIFA’s executive, which would make him the first playing member of world football’s most important committee. QPR defender Ferdinand is one of four past and present footballers — the others being David James, Graeme Le Saux and Paul Elliott — who are in the FA’s thoughts for the post. This is because UEFA executive member David Gill, the most obvious successor when Northern Ireland’s Jim Boyce steps down next year, does not want to work with a regime led by Sepp Blatter, who is certain to be re-elected for a fifth term as FIFA president in 2015. Rio Ferdinand, in action for Queens Park Rangers, could be the next British vice-president at FIFA . Ferdinand joined Queens Park Rangers in the summer after he was allowed to leave Manchester United . The FA have no plan B in place for another contender from the other Home Nations to face competition for the British vice-presidency in a vote at the UEFA Congress in Vienna in March. So FA general secretary Alex Horne, who rules out himself and FA chairman Greg Dyke from standing due to their current commitments, is sensibly examining other options. And putting forward such a big-name player as Ferdinand would go down well with UEFA president Michel Platini, who wants to see more players on committees. Meanwhile, another problem to be faced is that FA of Wales president Trefor Lloyd Hughes believes there is a ‘gentlemen’s agreement’ in place for Wales to fill the next British VP seat at FIFA as they are the only Home Nation never to have done so before. But the FA claim any such contract — and Wales say they have a signed paper — is now null and void following recent reforms in which the four Home Nations preserve their law-making roles on the international FA Board, while all 54 European countries will vote in future on Britain’s FIFA vice-presidency. Northern Ireland’s Jim Boyce (left) is due to step down next year from his position as vice-president . There are six broadcast and newspaper journalists being interviewed this week for the job of BBC sports editor, which the Beeb have yet to get anywhere near right. A strong set of candidates come from BBC, Sky, ITV and national newspapers. The interview panel were split between wanting a talking head or a news-getter, but the make-up of the shortlist suggests the preference will be for finding stories rather than waffling across outlets. Paul's expensive taste . Following FIFA’s fuss over the gifts of ultra-expensive watches at the World Cup, there’s never been any questions asked about each member of the European Ryder Cup team receiving a pricey, specially engraved Rolex watch chosen by the captain. This time Paul McGinley has gone for a steel GMT-2 priced at around £7,500. Football powerbrokers Greg ‘six-watch’ Dyke and Michel Platini both gave the impression at the Euro 2020 venue summit in Geneva that everyone on the sports circuit — including the media — get expensive gifts all the time. It should be noted the press freebies at the Ryder Cup this week consist of a tartan credit card holder, a notebook and a box of chocolates, as opposed to the £16,400 Parmigianis in Dyke and Platini’s goodie bags at the FIFA Congress. European Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley opted for a steel watch priced at £7,500 for each of his players .

This should at least ensure the triumphant players are rather less tired and emotional than they were at Medinah in 2012. It was three hours after the winning putt before they arrived and they were far more concerned about carrying on celebrating than facing the press. Both Ryder Cup captains, Tom Watson and Paul McGinley, whose love-in on Monday hopefully won’t continue all week, are leaving it to their players to decide when it is appropriate to tweet from Gleneagles — a high-risk tactic when such a savvy tweeter as Gary Lineker caused controversy for using the F-word when his club Leicester beat Manchester United. Meanwhile, McGinley says he has measures in place to ensure none of his team arrive on the course 11 minutes before their tee-off time, as Rory McIlroy did at Medinah. But fortunately for Rory, it would take about that time to reach the first tee on the Centenary Course from his Gleneagles Hotel bed. McGinley and his opposite number Tom Watson have been relaxed during the build up to the Ryder Cup .","Rio Ferdinand is one of four past and present footballers being considered .

"It was the day before Everton's return to Europe and Phil Jagielka was holding court in the media auditorium at Finch Farm. A naturally bubbly character, Jagielka was in high spirits as he focused on the imminent clash with Wolfsburg but it was only a matter of time before he knew the topic of conversation would change. He would have to confront a difficult summer and testing start to the new campaign. 'A little bit sticky,' was how he chose to describe the last four months. It was, perhaps, an understatement. Having been in the firing line for England's World Cup demise and scrutinised for the poor goals Everton had been conceding, lesser souls might have found it all too much. Phil Jagielka is not one to shy away from pressure, and has faced a difficult period admirably . Everton captain Jagielka was impressive against Liverpool in the Merseyside derby on Saturday . Jagielka scored a stunning goal from 25 yards to rescue a late point for his Everton side . Jagielka, though, is not someone who will ever hide. He is a character who will face up to issue and however hard he found the questions, he answered them impressively. He fights and doesn't give in. That is why, in the 91st minute of the 223rd Merseyside derby, he was scuffling around the edge of Liverpool's penalty area, trying to find a way of helping his team salvage something from a game that was slipping away. How Everton's captain delivered. Latching on to a headed clearance from Dejan Lovren, Jagielka crashed volley from 25 yards into the top corner of The Kop net, to leave Anfield – bar one delirious Blue corner – in stunned silence. It was, undoubtedly, the most spectacular goal scored by an Everton player behind enemy lines since Graeme Sharp's howitzer in 1984. Simon Mignolet (left) is powerless to stop Jagielka's howitzer at Anfield on Saturday lunchtime . Everton players celebrate Jagielka's equalising goal, which rescued a point for the Toffees late on . Seasons, both individually and collectively, can be transformed in such dramatic moments and so high was the quality of the goal, Roberto Martinez labelled it the best he had seen at a live game. 'We pushed up a little bit and there was an opportunity about five minutes before when I elected to pass and I thought if one comes across again I'll swing one at it and thankfully the swinging worked,' Jagielka said modestly. 'It's been a frustrating season so far and to go one-nil down and to keep knocking at the door the way we did shows tremendous character. A point is decent, we'd have loved three. But we've got to make sure we keep the character strong because right now we're not picking up the right results.' Jagielka's performance, in front of England manager Roy Hodgson, may go some way to restoring his international place . Jagielka (right) admits he is no longer a starter in the England team, but his performance yesterday will have impressed Hodgson, sat observing in the Director's Box . Everton did not play well yesterday but, at the back, the combination of Jagielka and John Stones was solid and their respective performances would have been noted by England head coach Roy Hodgson, who was sat observing in the Directors' Box. Jagielka accepts he is no longer a first choice for England, given he was dropped for the recent games against Norway and Switzerland, but if he keeps playing in this manner, both club and country will feel the benefit. This has to be a catalyst for revival. 'We've performed ok but the results haven't shown it,' said Jagielka. 'So it's about the lads to come out and keep playing the way we are and keep having the courage to do the right things and hopefully they'll turn around.' He is proof of that. Jagielka (centre) heads for the degout as he celebrates with team-mates at Anfield .","Phil Jagielka has been in the firing line for both Everton's poor start to the season and England's World Cup demise .

"Tom Watson hit back at Phil Mickelson after he criticised the USA Ryder Cup captain following their defeat at Gleneagles. The USA captain was the subject of scrutiny on day one with his picks, and Mickelson joined the critics with a damning assessment, saying that Watson 'strayed from a winning formula' used in 2008.

'That's the controversy and that's the issue but I have to say that I'm very proud of my team's efforts.

Since their victory under captain Paul Azinger at Valhalla in 2008, the USA have failed to win any of the last three Ryder Cups. Mickelson explained: 'There were two things that allowed us to play our best that Paul Azinger did. 'First, he got everybody invested in the process. He got everybody invested in who they were going to play with, who the picks were going to be, who was going to be in their 'pod', when they would play, and they had a great leader for each pod. We hung out together. Watson was regarded as an autocratic captain and stuck, unsuccessfuly, to his guns through the weekend . The American team stands for their national anthem after losing the Ryder Cup for the third successive time . 'The other things that Paul did really well was he had a game plan for us - how we were going to go about doing this, how we were going to go about playing together, if so-and-so is playing well, if so-and-so is not playing well. 'Those two things helped us bring out our best golf. We use that same process in the Presidents Cup and we do really well.

"Phil Mickelson could get his wish after Paul Azinger said on Monday he was open to a second spell as US Ryder Cup captain. Mickelson caused controversy on Sunday when, within two hours of the United States suffering a third straight defeat in the biennial contest, he criticised the approach of captain Tom Watson. With Watson sitting just a few feet away, Mickelson - who had been left out of a full day's play on Saturday for the first time in 10 Ryder Cup appearances - stated his support for the methods of Azinger, who captained the side to their last win at Valhalla in 2008. Phil Mickelson (left) alongside Tom Watson, who he criticised swiftly after the conclusion of the Ryder Cup . Tom Watson's (pictured) captaincy produced a 16½ - 11½ loss for the USA . Phil Mickelson plays out of a bunker on the 17th hole at Gleneagles, Scotland on Sunday . 'Unfortunately we have strayed from a winning formula for the last three Ryder Cups and we need to consider maybe getting back to that formula that helped us play our best,' Mickelson said. Asked if he would captain the side again, Azinger told USA Today: 'I'm not going to rule anything out.' The 54-year-old said the United States needed to move away from appointing 'lone wolf' captains, instead copying the European model of selecting players who had experience of the Ryder Cup as vice-captains. 'The PGA of America (which appoints the captain) has officers that move up the ranks, getting sage advice along the way, and then many of them stick around and keep offering advice,' Azinger said. 'I think the PGA of America should recognize their business model is exactly the same as what Europe uses in selecting a captain.' Team Europe celebrate with their partners following their Ryder Cup win on Sunday . Paul Azinger, pictured holding the Ryder Cup, was captain when the USA last overcame Europe . Tom Watson (centre) shakes hands with winning captain Paul McGinley shortly before Europe's win was confirmed on Sunday afternoon . Of the past 10 US captains, only two had previously been vice-captains. 'There is a razor-thin line between winning and losing these matches,' Azinger added. 'Europe has the intangible right now. They give themselves the extra one per cent chance to win through its business model and cohesiveness. 'Even if you play blackjack perfectly in a casino, the casino still has a very slight edge against you. Right now Europe is the casino and the US is the guy walking to the blackjack table with a fistful of 50s.' Mickelson's comments, and the timing of them, drew fierce criticism with former PGA Tour player Brandel Chamblee, who now works as an analyst for the Golf Channel, saying: 'That was as close to a one-man mutiny as I have ever seen. I think that's a moment that Phil would like to have back. Phil Mickelson speaking to the media in the aftermath of the USA's Ryder Cup defeat at Gleneagles . Then USA captain Paul Azinger waves his country's flag after their 2008 Ryder Cup win . 'If you are looking for a reason why the US continues to lose you just saw it, you saw it in one man, Phil Mickelson. 'Phil Mickelson, along with the best players of that era, have so corrupted the experience of the Ryder Cup for their fellow competitors by not having records anywhere near where they should given their rank in the game.' Azinger's success was based on a 'pod' system which involved creating three groups of four players and allowing them to have a major influence on decisions, while Watson appeared to rely almost exclusively on his opinion and that of his vice-captains. Asked whether he was consulted in any of the decision-making at Gleneagles, Mickelson said: 'No. Nobody here was, in any decision.' Watson had said in the build-up that he would use a modified version of Azinger's pod system, but added on Sunday: 'I didn't discount it. I just had a different philosophy right off the bat. 'He (Mickelson) has a difference of opinion. That's okay. My management philosophy is different than his.'","Phil Mickelson caused controversy on Sunday when he openly criticised Tom Watson's captaincy methods less than two hours after close of play .

"Gareth Barry looked a man on a mission for a yellow card in the Merseyside derby. It took referee Martin Atkinson just two minutes to oblige, booking the Everton midfielder for a feisty challenge on Adam Lallana. Barry could have warranted another caution for handling Raheem Sterling's shot inside of the area and for fouling Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli, too. Nevertheless, the yellow the 33-year-old received was enough to move Barry tantelisingly close to the top of the all-time Premier League bookings' list, but who will he have to overtake first? Liverpool's Adam Lallana went sent flying after a reckless challenge by Everton's Gareth Barry . Gareth Barry receives a yellow card after just two minutes during the Merseyside derby against Liverpool . 10. Wayne Rooney (81 bookings) Rooney is no stranger to ill discipline. The Manchester United and England captain kindly reminded us of that at Old Trafford on Saturday, although his hack on West Ham's Stewart Downing warranted a straight red from Lee Mason. It was reminiscent of Rooney's sending off in the 2006 World Cup against Portugal for a stamp on Ricardo Carvalho - yet more evidence of repercussions for the 28-year-old's hot-headed decisions. Eighty-one bookings in the Premier League means Rooney sits 10th in the table for now. Wayne Rooney commits a professional foul on West Ham's Stewart Downing during the Premier League tie . Manchester United's Wayne Rooney's foul, however, warranted more than a yellow as the captain saw red . Wayne Rooney couldn't believe he didn't just get a caution - which would have tied him with Philip Neville . 9. Philip Neville (82 bookings) Former Manchester United and Everton defender Neville was hardly an angel during his 18-year stint in the Premier League, and he received 82 bookings before retiring. In 2006, Neville finished the season with the most yellow cards out of any player in the league - 12. Three years earlier, the now-BBC pundit was United's most-booked player despite starting just six games. In contrast his brother, Gary, received three yellows to his seven that season. Phil Neville receives a card - as he did 82 times in the Premier League with Everton and Manchester United . 8. Kevin Nolan (83 bookings) West Ham's midfielder Nolan is never one to shy away from a challenge. The former Bolton and Newcastle  midfielder thought he'd equalised in the dying moments at Old Trafford on Saturday after coming on as a 75th-minute substitute. His quacking celebration was cut short for offside, however, and Nolan must wait patiently for his first goal - and booking - of the season. This year, Nolan is yet to see yellow in his two Premier League appearances since returning from a shoulder injury. Last season, though, he registered as many cautions as he did goals - seven. Newcastle's Kevin Nolan makes a nasty challenge on Everton's Victor Anichebe in 2009 at St James' Park . Kevin Nolan receives a red card on this occasion and the West Ham midfielder knows how to get a yellow . 7. George Boateng (85 bookings) In Boateng's 13 years in the Premier League, the midfielder received 85 yellow cards. Coventry City, Aston Villa, Middlesbrough and Hull City were his clubs between 1997 and 2010, and Boateng  kept his yellow card count up  throughout. It was in that final year he received a second booking for a dangerous challenge on Bacary Sagna after poking Nicklas Bendtner in the eye. Ten in 1998, and nine apiece in the following two years. Boateng was nothing if not consistent. Geroge Boateng pokes Arsenal's Nicklas Bendtner in the eye during their Premier League match in 2010 . 6. Robbie Savage (89 bookings) For a while, Savage held the illustrious position at the top of this most-booked players table. He has since, though, lost his 'dirtiest player in Premier League history' crown and been overtaken. Savage was, by no means, a stranger to a telling off from a referee. Take the 2003-04 season, for example. The midfielder received 13 yellow cards that year at Birmingham alone. Two years later, he was cautioned 11 times for Blackburn. That makes the ex-Derby and Leicester player sixth in our list with a total of 89. Robbie Savage took his yellow card exploits to the Championship with Derby County as shown in 2011 . Robbie Savage received 89 bookings during his time in the Premier League with Blackburn and more . 5. Scott Parker (92 bookings) Parker no longer adds to his Premier League tally of 92 as the Fulham midfielder competes in the Championship. Nevertheless, the 33-year-old remains comfortably fifth. It seems Newcastle brought the aggressive nature out of Parker. The England international was booked nine times in each of his two seasons at St James' Park between 2005 and 2007. That said, Parker bested that in 2002-03 with Charlton, adding 10 to his still-young tally at the time.

Gareth Barry (96 bookings) The man in the running for the title. Barry added one more to his 96 on Saturday, and the midfielder could be top of the list by the end of this season with Everton if he continues his trend. In Barry's defence, the 33-year-old sits fifth in the Premier League's all-time appearances list, too, having played more than 500 games for Aston Villa, Manchester City and Everton combined. Working in the engine room, a yellow card arriving here or there can only be expected. Gareth Barry marks Mario Balotelli during the Merseyside derby between Everton and Liverpool . Gareth Barry keeps his eye on the ball and can break the record for the most Premier League yellow cards . 3. Paul Scholes (97 bookings) The former Manchester United midfielder was not unfamiliar with seeing a referee reach for his pocket. Arguably his most famous yellow card did not arrive in the Premier League, though. It came in the semi final of the Champions League. Scholes was cautioned against Juventus, ruling him out of their win in the 1999 final against Bayern Munich  at the Nou Camp. That rule has since been changed after UEFA announced they will no longer hold suspensions that carry to such European finals. Too little, too late for Scholes, though. Paul Scholes receives a caution during Manchester United's 1999 Champions League tie with Juventus . Paul Scholes receives a yellow card as he plays for Manchester United during the Champions League in 2007 . =1. Lee Bowyer (99 bookings) =1. Kevin Davies (99 bookings) And we have a tie! Neither could nab a century during their time in the Premier League and, barring any miraculous return from the 37-year-old Davies, they'll have to share the infamous title. Two different players that went very different ways about getting to the peak of this list. Davies, now a striker for League One club Preston, stayed true to his yellow card nature internationally. The former Blackburn, Southampton and Bolton goalscorer made his England debut in 2010 as a substitute for Peter Crouch, and was immediately booked. Hardly surprising, given Davies has committed the most fouls in Premier League history, too. Former Blackburn and Bolton striker Kevin Davies receives a yellow card during his time for England . Bowyer, on the other hand, was far more of a traditional scrapper. Squaring up with fellow players - and on the odd occasion his own Newcastle teammate Kieron Dyer - became a regular occurrence. The ex-Leeds, West Ham, Newcastle and Birmingham midfielder first season in the Premier League in 1996 saw the aggressive player pick up seven bookings, his last in 2011 finished the same. Davies and Bowyer may not remain top for long, however, as Barry nears the unwanted record. Lee Bowyer grabs a handful of Liam Miller and vice versa during their Premier League match in 2007 .

"Wayne Rooney believes the best days of his career are still to come as the striker seeks to immortalise himself for both club and country. The 28-year-old is within touching distance of the all-time goalscoring records for both Manchester United and England, and he believes the next two or three seasons will be a golden time for him. In an interview with the Sunday Times, Rooney said: 'I still believe I can get better as a footballer.

Wayne Rooney 41 (97) 5. Michael Owen 40 (89) Rooney's goal against West Ham took him to 218 in a United shirt and he is in striking distance of Denis Law (237) and Bobby Charlton (249) at the top of the club's all-time list. Rooney also needs another nine goals to overtake Charlton as England's all-time leading scorer and could well achieve it before the next European Championships. But while it would be preferable to play in a forward position in order to chase down these records, Rooney acknowledges that his future may eventually lay in midfield. He said: '[Louis van Gaal] goes into so much detail about the opposition and there'll be times I'll be needed to play deeper or wider, which I've no problem doing. Rooney knows that United manager Louis van Gaal may want him to play in midfield in the future . 'But in the main I feel I've still got at least two or three years up front. I know I've got the qualities to play in midfield. I've done it comfortably. 'There'll come a time when I move to a deeper position for good and that could be this week, it could be in a couple of years. It's down to the manager and I'll accept it.' Sunday marks 10 years to the day since Rooney's spectacular debut for United, when the 18-year-old scored a hat-trick in a 6-2 Champions League win over Fenerbahce at Old Trafford. In the intervening years, he has won six Premier League titles, three League Cups, the Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup.

"Luke Shaw thinks Manchester United are having a lot of bad luck with refereeing decisions and that Wayne Rooney's red card against West Ham was harsh. The England captain hacked Stewart Downing with a cynical kick from behind while the Hammers midfielder was racing away from his own box in the second half. However, Shaw feels the referee should have blown moments earlier for a handball. Wayne Rooney was sent off for this foul on West Ham midfielder Stewart Downing .

'We have actually had a lot of bad luck, especially with Wazza's red card as I would say there was a handball before that but the referee didn't stop play.' Shaw, who moved to United from Southampton for £31million this summer, put in a good performance down the left, where he combined well with club record signing Angel di Maria. And he added: 'When I started my debut (for Southampton) at Stevenage, I said to myself I want to be playing for the best teams in the best league. 'I've done that at the moment and now it's my chance to keep improving as a player. I feel I can do that now.' Luke Shaw gets away from Diafra Sakho on his Manchester United debut . Shaw has had an eventful three months at Old Trafford. Shortly after making his competitive England debut at the World Cup, Shaw incurred the wrath of Van Gaal for turning up to pre-season out of shape. The Dutchman made Shaw train on his own on the tour of the United States and said: 'Luke needs to be fit and he's not very fit. He can't perform how I want.' However, Van Gaal was so impressed with the 19-year-old's attitude in training, that he said the teenager was 'an example' to the rest of his star-studded United squad. Shaw (right) celebrates with Robin van Persie after the Dutchman put United 2-0 up . 'For him to say I'm an example at a massive club like this is something to be really happy about,' the England defender said. 'He was right to say what he said about me in pre-season. 'We had a discussion then and the plan for me was to get my fitness up. It worked, apart from the injury. 'It was a bit of setback but I've worked hard in the last weeks and had some talks. He's been a great inspiration to me and hopefully I can carry that on.' Like our Manchester United Facebook page here.","Luke Shaw says Man Utd haven't had much luck with refereeing decisions .

"Graziano Pelle took one touch with his right boot to flick the ball to shoulder height while already beginning to swivel on his standing leg. In one fluid motion he flung his body into the air, twisted acrobatically and sent the ball flying into the top right-hand corner.

Graziano Pelle makes the perfect connection from a cross to score in spectacular fashion at St Mary's . Pelle celebrates in front of QPR forward Eduardo Vargas as the Saints regain the lead on Saturday . The South Coast club dominated the game, striking the upright twice and keeping Queens Park Rangers goalkeeper Rob Green busy all afternoon. But they needed something special to eventually break through and their £8million summer signing, brought in for the daunting task of replacing Rickie Lambert, provided it. ‘I often do these things during training,’ a nonchalant Pelle explained afterwards. Ryan Bertrand scores his first goal for Southampton as Ronald Koeman's side take the lead against QPR . It was said with the swaggering confidence of a striker who has taken no time adapting his game to English football. He has netted five goals in eight games already. There were reservations about Southampton manager Ronald Koeman raiding former club Feyenoord for the Italian when they lost Lambert to Liverpool. Players so often flourish in Holland but cannot reach those levels when they face the demands of the Barclays Premier League. ‘I’ve got experience enough now to realise where I am,’ Pelle added. ‘I have to be honest, it was not so easy in the beginning. 'However I was lucky I came to England a month before the start of the season, then I had a long time to adapt myself. ‘All the games are difficult, all the teams, from the lowest to the top, are always good; good organisation, strong and fit.’ As manager of Feyenoord, Koeman plucked Pelle from Italian side Parma. During his two seasons in Holland he scored 50 goals in 57 league games. ‘He is learning fast,’ said the Dutchman. Charlie Austin celebrated putting QPR back on level terms against Southampton in the second half . Charlie Austin’s goal ended QPR’s barren run of nine hours and 15 minutes without a goal away from home in the Premier League. ‘In the first two weeks I told him, “It’s not Holland”. In Holland if you bring 70 per cent of your physical effort you will win the battle. ‘In the Premier League you have to bring more than 100 per cent, and he’s doing that.

"An hour after full-time at Old Trafford and Louis van Gaal was standing in a corridor doing what he is paid to do: manage people. Only two or three months into his first job in English football and already Van Gaal knows how important Wayne Rooney is to his team at Manchester United. Hence there was no public criticism for the foul that earned his captain a red card against West Ham and a probable three-game ban. The only criticism came from West Ham manager Sam Allardyce, who described Rooney’s hack at Stewart Downing as crazy and irresponsible. Instead, from United’s manager, there was only praise for Rooney and even a half-endorsement for the act itself. Wayne Rooney saw red for hacking down former England team-mate Stewart Downing . Wayne Rooney is gutted at referee Lee Mason brandishes a straight red card . The England and Manchester United skipper chucks the captain's armband to Robin van Persie . Van Gaal, one sensed, knew exactly what he was doing. As he looks to ease United through this difficult period, he knows he needs to keep Rooney onside. ‘For me, he doesn’t have to change,’ said Van Gaal. ‘He just needed to do it (the foul) in a different manner. He said it to me afterwards. He will be a big miss. He is my captain and he is playing to a good standard in his new role. He is an example to the squad. ‘That I saw in the USA and when he came back he kept that example and that’s why I made him captain. He is also a great player.’ As Van Gaal spoke, Rooney was offering his own mea culpa. The theme was similar. ‘It was probably the right decision to send me off,’ said Rooney. ‘I saw the West Ham player making a counter-attack and tried to break-up the play. I just misjudged it. I am gutted that I am going to miss the next three games. I expect people to say it’s my temper again but I was trying to break up the play. It was a dangerous situation and I just misjudged it. ‘But I have no complaints. I haven’t absolutely volleyed the lad. I have tried to trip him up and he got further away from me and that is why my leg is straighter than it should have been. I have apologised to the lads. I think everyone knew (I was in the wrong). I am just grateful they were able to hold on. It’s always tough against 11 men when you are a man down, especially when they are throwing a lot of balls into the box, so I am grateful that we held out.’ The two sides of Wayne Rooney - third most Premier League goals but in the top-10 all time booked players . This graphic shows how crazy Wayne Rooney's foul on Stewart Downing was - there were four covering defenders . Rooney confirmed after Saturday’s game that he will not appeal agains the decision. The likelihood is, therefore, that he will receive a ban that will rule him out of matches against Everton, West Brom and Chelsea. Rooney’s next game is likely to be at Manchester City on November 2. By then we will perhaps know a little more about the new United. Here on Saturday, we saw both sides of them. They scored lovely goals through Rooney and Robin van Persie but then conceded a poor one from a corner and were beginning to look uncertain by the time Rooney was sent off with half an hour left.Allardyce said: ‘It was crazy and irresponsible and it gave us the chance to get something. We all know that lads trip up players but he give him a bit of a swipe. It give us a great chance and that’s why we’re so sick now. After we scored, you could see United get nervous but you can’t do what we did which is gift them two (goals) early on.’ West Ham substitute Kevin Nolan thought he had scored a last-minute equaliser only to be ruled offside but there was enough to encourage Allardyce. His team head into next weekend’s game against QPR with some confidence while United await the visit of Everton sweating on the fitness of Ander Herrera, who left this game injured, and aware that none of their injured centre backs are like to be fit.

"Diego Costa is the real deal as a striker. His attributes look tailor-made for English football. He has a bit of everything about him. He is great at holding the ball up, has enough speed to get in behind defenders, can work the 18-yard box and is clearly not going to be intimidated by physical opponents. Costa scored a hat-trick against Swansea City last weekend and is already on seven goals in a blue shirt . I would put his former Atletico team-mate, Radamel Falcao, just ahead of him overall but he still looks like the missing link for Chelsea. They — as Atletico before them — have worked out how to play in the way that suits him best, which Spain, with their short intricate passing, didn’t manage in the World Cup. Together with Cesc Fabregas, he has formed a wonderful understanding and Chelsea look a better side than last season — and that’s after having made a profit of transfers in the summer. Fabregas looks to be the perfect replacement for Frank Lampard. He might not score as many but he will create more. Radamel Falcao (left) has arrived in the Premier League from Monaco, and will attempt to emulate Costa . Fabregas has slotted seamlessly back into English football following his arrival back from Barcelona . I would imagine he’ll play just behind Costa at Manchester City on Sunday, with Ramires and Nemanja Matic sitting in the deeper positions to add a bit more solidity. You might have thought it would take Chelsea three or four months for their new signings to settle in but Costa, Fabregas and Thibaut Courtois have adapted straight away, which is why I have them as title favourites. They don’t need to win on Sunday; a draw would do them fine. Jose Mourinho always said that this was the season on which we should judge him and, so far, that’s looking like a good call. Costa trains with team-mates ahead of Chelsea's clash with Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium .

"Roy Hodgson has a rare luxury as an England manager in that he has a year to build a team who are almost sure to qualify for Euro 2016. It probably does not feel that way to him, as every game as England manager feels as though it has potential dangers. But, in reality, England have weathered the storm of their World Cup disappointment and are now firmly focused on Euro 2016. I fully expect the team to make another step in that direction in Estonia on Sunday. Given that we are almost certain to qualify, I believe there is an opportunity to be bold and try different players. Roy has settled on the diamond formation as one way of playing and, as such, that needs a good holding player. Hull City midfielder Tom Huddlestone during one of his four caps with England previously . This graphic shows how England could line up if Huddlestone was to be introduced into the diamond . Jack Wilshere did do really well there on Thursday night, though it is difficult to judge against San Marino when you have so much time on the ball. And it is not his natural game. On Thursday night, both Ian Wright and I came up with the name of Tom Huddlestone as an alternative. He is not currently in favour. He has just four caps and has been used only once by Roy, as a substitute in a friendly against Sweden. As a sitting player, there are few Englishmen who can match Huddlestone. He does that job of screening the back four and he has a range of passing that few can match. I am also looking forward to the return of Daniel Sturridge. With Danny Welbeck and Wayne Rooney fit, England could field a fearsome front three. I think they could all play together, with Rooney playing just behind the front two, as he has started to do for his club. There would still be room for Raheem Sterling. He has the tactical awareness to play on the outside of the diamond and give you width. Glenn Hoddle and Ian Wright both feel Huddlestone could be a sufficient alternative in the England diamond . Huddlestone (right) could give England manager Roy Hodgson an option as an alternative holding midfielder . In a diamond, I always like to have it a little lop-sided, with one player on the outside who can go a bit wider and one who tucks inside. Sterling would give you that option. Adam Lallana would be perfect to go on the left, or Wilshere. And you still have Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Andros Townsend and, when he is fit, Ross Barkley to add to that mix. There is a great range of attacking options for England coming through, with the potential to generate excitement. With this run of qualification games, we have a chance to nail down an attacking system and get so confident with it, so that by the time we get to Euro 2016, we may be causing teams so many problems we can worry less about the problems they are causing us. Hodgson has settled on the diamond formation  and, as such, that needs a good holding player to turn to .","Roy Hodgson has settled on the diamond formation for England .

"So much has been made of Raheem Sterling and England this week that we are in danger of missing the main point. People have hardly spoken about the fact that he came off the bench, won a free-kick with his ability and helped to change the game and win the three points for England in their Euro qualifier against Estonia. I know that when you are England manager you can be distracted by the side-shows away from football. Perhaps that is inevitable in this tournament, with its new qualification format, which means that England are already almost certain to qualify. The main story is unlikely to be about the game — or at least, let’s hope not, as it will mean that England have lost. It is tangential issues that will dominate. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch... Raheem Sterling (second from left) watches England take on Estonia from the bench in Tallinn . The Liverpool star had complained of leg weariness to manager Roy Hodgson the day before the game . But, from Roy Hodgson’s point of view, he has to ensure that he stays focused on the main thing — the match. Whether Sterling said he was tired or not and however upset or not Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers is about his player being discussed, England still won the game. And they won it because Sterling came off the bench and won the free-kick that created the goal at a stage when it looked as though England might not score from open play. You could easily spin the situation on its head and say it was good management. The manager kept him hungry, brought him on, he showed a great attitude and changed the game. Part of the challenge of being the England manager is that there is a feeling that you are leasing someone’s car. It is not yours and you always have that at the back of your mind as you sometimes have to tread carefully. But when a player is on international duty, he is an England player and the manager has to have the authority to do what he wants. Essentially, there was nothing wrong with the way Roy dealt with the situation. Whatever the reason for leaving him out — whether it was Raheem saying he was tired or Roy wanting to play a different way — it produced a result. I know that off-field issues can overshadow what you do with England. I had a similar situation with David Beckham, who was always a focal point for the media, like Sterling is now. David Beckham (pictured with Argentina's Diego Simeone in 1998) was a focal point under Glenn Hoddle . Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has been pushing the issue with Hodgson over the last week . Sterling came on in the second half and won the free-kick which led to Wayne Rooney's winning goal . Sterling, pictured celebrating a goal against Tottenham, began the season in fine form for Liverpool . There is one tournament I don’t especially want to see Raheem Sterling in — and that’s the Under-21 European Championship in the Czech Republic next summer. I know it would be lovely to give it our best shot to win it but my feeling is that established senior England internationals should be resting in the summer. It is different for players who have won only a few caps in the senior team. Luke Shaw, Calum Chambers, John Stones and Ross Barkley still have things to prove in an England shirt. They should certainly be part of the squad for Euro 2015. But Sterling, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Jack Wilshere and Phil Jones can justifiably sit it out without anyone questioning their desire or their clubs’ motives. They are established members of England’s first XI. Remember what the development teams are there to do — to develop established players for the senior team. And those who have already achieved that goal don’t need another summer commitment. They would be better off resting and focusing on Euro 2016. But you have to keep drawing people back to what is happening on the pitch and I would have focused on that after the game. The kid has come on and affected the game — my word, he affected it — and that is all you can ask of your subs. What I like about Sterling is his bravery. People might not associate that description with him. But bravery is not all about flying tackles and cut heads; there is bravery on the ball and that counts as well. Sterling has courage to take players on, to try something different and beat people. That is what helped change the game. He will win plenty of free-kicks and penalties because he has quick feet and pace to get in and around the penalty area. It is not like he just does it out wide — he does it in areas that hurt you. Of course, at QPR we have to come up with a plan for stopping him, which is much easier said than done. It is very difficult to pin down someone like Sterling because the laws of the game have changed in favour of the more skilful players, which is one of the reasons why he will be such an asset for club and country. The only way to contain such a player is to work hard collectively in all areas of the pitch to minimise the space he has. But it is hard to pin him down because he is so comfortable in a variety of positions, something unusual in such a young player. Whether you play him out wide, just off a front man, at the tip of a diamond or on the edge of the diamond. In the modern game, there’s no need to limit his strengths by defining just one position for him. He can play in a variety of roles and that flexibility marks out a good player. Rodgers has been critical of England's treatment of his star players already this season . Even more encouraging for England is that Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Ross Barkley will push him; and Theo Walcott and Andros Townsend can challenge him in wide positions. At 19, Sterling is far from his peak. He needs to add consistency but, having become a key member of the Liverpool and England teams, he will come on leaps and bounds. We should be celebrating his talent and, at the end of his career, events of the past week will be long forgotten, no doubt seen as something unimportant. Nurture him and support him and English football has a talent to enjoy. Let’s hope we see much more from him — after the match at Loftus Road, of course. Manuel Pellegrini won the Premier League but even he might be feeling the pressure if Manchester City do not win at CSKA Moscow on Tuesday night. It is a massive game for them. The club clearly want to do well in the Champions League and at least see some progress, which would mean a quarter-final or the semis this season. That is what the City fans would be expecting. If they went out early again, I don’t think Pellegrini would lose his job but he would probably feel he had to win the Premier League to be safe. City have to be aggressive and get six points from this game and the return leg, when CSKA come to the Etihad two weeks later. That would put them back in the frame to qualify and give Pellegrini a chance to do something about City’s poor reputation in Europe. Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini will feel the heat should they fail to beat CSKA Moscow on Tuesday . If there’s one place I would like to be this week it’s the Kop on Wednesday night for the visit of Real Madrid. Champions League football came back to Anfield last month but this feels like the kind of fixture Liverpool fans have been waiting for over the last four years. There isn’t a stadium in the world that will top the atmosphere that night. This Real Madrid side remind me of their famous Galatico team with all their amazing attacking talent — and this time they have better balance to it, with Luka Modric and Toni Kroos. But Liverpool ought to be inspired for this game. Maybe the passion of the Kop can help them get the result they need to stay in the mix to qualify.

"Wayne Rooney is still an excellent player who can make the difference for England but from what I’ve seen of him over the past 10 games or so, he has forgotten about the player he used to be. Having been given the captaincy, I think he was trying to be disciplined and focused on Wednesday and he has got to release that a little and play with some of the energy and freedom of old. He probably didn’t realise it but on Wednesday he got stuck in the inside-left position. When the wingers come in, he’s then got to float out and play wider. He never really read that situation. Tough times: Wayne Rooney has struggled to find his best form for England in recent matches . All smiles: Rooney chats with Raheem Sterling as England prepare to take on Switzerland on Monday . And he’s getting pinned down a bit in one position. When he was younger, he was making movements off the ball much more. He’s becoming a player who wants the ball to his feet too much and to play passes. I think he has a mind block. Someone has to show him video of the movement he made when he was younger and the space he created for others. It’s a pattern and it’s something he has to look at. It’s not because of fitness; he’s still fit enough to make those runs. He just has to mix his game up. Coaches have to identify these things and make sure players see them. In the old days, you had to rely on the coach’s eye. These days it’s easier, because you have so much evidence in terms of stats and videos and analysis which can show exactly where you have received the ball and when. During the World Cup, I raised the possibility of him dropping into midfield and long-term that’s a very real possibility for England and Manchester United. Spot on: Rooney scored the only goal of the game against Norway as England edged to a nervy win . Time for a change? Rooney could be deployed in midfield by England and Manchester United . United played with Juan Mata and Angel di Maria as offensive midfielders against Burnley and I can see Rooney in that role. And if nobody grasps the midfield area for England, I can see him going deeper there, too. Coming on to the play from deeper might suit him, as you have space to run into. Playing as a floating striker, you can end up with your back to goal an awful lot. For now, though, he will play as a centre forward and it’s important he gets back to his best. He seems to be taking the captaincy very, very seriously. And there are responsibilities off the pitch, but we don’t want that to affect him on the pitch. We want him to have pride in the job but we don’t want him to think he has to change the way he plays. He needs to be a mover of the ball, playing passes that will hurt teams. He needs to mix his game up. We want the Wayne Rooney of old.","Wayne Rooney has forgotten about the player he used to be .

"Chelsea legend Frank Lampard could line up against his former team-mates this weekend as Jose Mourinho's side travel to the Etihad Stadium to take on Premier League champions Manchester City this weekend. Lampard joined rivals Manchester City on a short-term loan deal after deciding to join New York City Football. Sportsmail have spoken to the likes of Mourinho and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink to find out whether they think Lampard will be cheered or jeered this weekend. Frank Lampard, pictured applauding the Stamford Bridge crowd, may get a bad reception on Sunday . Jose Mourinho . (Chelsea manager) He made a decision and we respect that. I cannot wish him good while he’s playing for a direct rival, especially when he’s playing against us, but he will always be one of my favourite ever players. Even a few months ago, when he signed for the New York team, I was not expecting this. But it was his decision. For me, it spoils nothing. I still believe what this club proposed to him, which is to come back when he wants. These were the words from Mr Abramovich and this is not in any danger. It is just a period of his career. He decided to play for City. His place in Chelsea’s history is untouchable. Jose Mourinho, pictured in 2005, was surprised to see Lampard join rivals Manchester City in the summer . Steve Clarke . (421 Chelsea appearances and four years as assistant manager to Jose Mourinho) He will always have a special place in the club. As a midfielder, to pass strikers like Kerry Dixon and Bobby Tambling to become the top scorer is unbelievable. Like everyone I was surprised when he signed for Man City, but Frank is not the type to do nothing for five months if there’s a chance to be involved. Chelsea have supporters who appreciate players who stay for a long time and do a good job. That’s really important. Instead of being acrimonious about departures, the club enjoy the time they were there. Former assistant manager Steve Clarke believes Chelsea's fans still appreciate Lampard . Ron Harris . (795 games for Chelsea, 1961-80) He’s been a terrific servant but some of the fans I talk to were very disappointed. Not that he left but that he signed on loan for Manchester City just a few weeks after saying he’d never play for another Premier League club. That stuck in their minds. Maybe the pounds, shillings and pence came into it, I don’t know. He’s a terrific lad, always goes out of his way to say hello. When I left Chelsea it was to be player-coach at Brentford. I played in a pre-season game against Chelsea and I got a good reception but I never said I wouldn’t play for another club. That’s the difference. Chelsea legend Ron Harris has questioned Lampard's decision to join Manchester City . Roberto di Matteo . (175 Chelsea games and Champions League-winning manager in 2012) Frank has been the best midfield player in the world in the past decade. His consistency and attitude in delivering top performances year after year is an inspiration for any professional football player. An easy player to work with because of his professionalism and intelligence. As a person he is an honest guy with good principles and integrity. Roberto di Matteo, speaking to Lampard ahead of the 2012 Champions League final, is a fan of the City ace . Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink . (69 goals in 136 games for Chelsea, 2000-04) I don’t think it changes a lot for the Chelsea fans. If Frank had been offered a contract he would have stayed. A lot of the fans understand that. I was treated really well when I played against them. It was refreshing. I know City is a rival for the title and it’s different to me, with Charlton and Middlesbrough, but I think he’ll get a good reception. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink has praised Chelsea's fans for giving him a good reception on his return to the Bridge with Charlton and Middlesbrough . Alec Stewart . (Former England cricket captain and Chelsea fan) I hope and expect Frank will be treated with the respect he deserves. I would be amazed if he is booed. He is an absolute legend of the club and I believe he’ll receive a similar ovation to Didier Drogba when he returned with Galatasaray. OK, I would have preferred him not to join City but it’s a new phase in his career, linked with his move to New York, and we all have to respect that. If he had joined Spurs it might be a different story... Alec Stewart believes Lampard should be given a similar level of ovation as what Didier Drogba received when he faced Chelsea in the Champions League . Dave Johnstone . (Spokesman for cfcuk fanzine) My all-time favourite Chelsea player and probably always will be, because of his human qualities as well as his football qualities. No way is he a traitor. We slipped up by letting him go. He would have been an inspiration for the young players at Cobham and a fantastic ally for Jose Mourinho. I think there’s a good chance the Chelsea fans will sing his name at the Etihad Stadium. I hope so.

"Seven months after a win which triggered all manner of talk about horses of different sizes, Jose Mourinho goes back to Manchester City astride a more formidable beast. Chelsea can go seven points clear of the champions if they win. His horse is high. His horse is rocking. But his centre forward is lame and Mourinho is hard to please on the quest for perfection. Yes, there has been progress, he admits, but it is a delicate balance. Jose Mourinho is not fully content with his squad despite their impressive start to the season . Chelsea, pictured celebrating Branislav Ivanovic's goal against Burnley, have been in scintillating form . ‘I am not happy with what we have,’ said Mourinho. ‘Everything I want to make better, everything. We are in the beginning of our second season. We are far from being the perfect team. ‘Are we better than last season? We believe so. Do we have more potential than before? I believe so. We have improved our team and our squad. But we still have lot of work to do. In this kind of competition, with the quality of opposition we have and the number of teams fighting for the same objectives, it’s going to be very hard. ‘I’m not saying we have problems. We have big space to improve. Players individually have big space to improve. We have lots to learn tactically. I don’t think I’ve ever been completely happy with my team.’ Chelsea are searching for a balance. They have been prolific in attack but prone to leaking goals and the fitness of Diego Costa is the big concern. With his extra power up front, Chelsea started the season in formidable style. While title rivals dropped points, fretted about World Cup hangovers and struggled for rhythm, Mourinho’s team won the first four and Costa scored seven goals. Then came confirmation that he was still troubled by the hamstring problem which surfaced at the end of last season. He did not start in the Champions League against Schalke on Wednesday and it could limit his activity for a few weeks. Diego Costa will start against Manchester City but will miss his side's Capital One Cup match against Bolton . Chelsea club doctor Eva Carneiro has been tasked with monitoring Costa's fitness closely . Costa will start at the Etihad, Mourinho confirmed, but will not feature in the Capital One Cup tie against Bolton on Wednesday, then return to face Aston Villa next Saturday. He will continue this way in the hope the issue can be treated during the week and improved. Does he need a couple of weeks’ off? ‘Yes,’ nodded Mourinho. But you want him to play? ‘Yes.’ Is it a risk? ‘Yes.’ But he’s so important. ‘Yes, he is.’ So, it is a calculated risk? ‘Yes, me, him and the doctor, the decision is made between us,’ said Mourinho. ‘Diego is not in the best condition but he will start the game. His attitude is amazing. Clearly, we have to try and protect him until he is completely fit. ‘What we can do to improve the situation, we have to do when he’s not playing. He needs work, not just from the medical department but also on the pitch and in the gym.’ Those who saw Costa train on Friday claimed it was impossible to tell he was carrying an injury. But if the hamstring goes, it will leave Mourinho to choose between 36-year-old Didier Drogba or Loic Remy at centre forward. Didier Drogba (left) or Loic Remy (right) will deputise for Costa when the Spanish international is not fully fit . Remy scored on his debut but the Chelsea boss prefers a more combative player to lead the line. Last season, when asked to assess Manchester City’s strengths, he remarked on the quality of their ‘third striker’ Edin Dzeko. When Sergio Aguero suffered injuries, Dzeko stepped forward, took responsibility and last month signed a new contract as Alvaro Negredo was loaned to Valencia. Costa has helped Chelsea add potency up front, but Mourinho has also loosened his team at the back.They have conceded six in the first four Premier League games for the first time since 2003 when Claudio Ranieri was in charge. Four years ago, under Carlo Ancelotti, they started the season with five wins which ground to a halt with defeat at the Etihad. Frank Lampard could come up against his former side after sealing a shock loan move to rivals Man City . Roman Abramovich is said to be pleased with the west London side's performances so far this season . Another defeat on Saturday, especially one inspired by Frank Lampard — allowed to leave Stamford Bridge by Mourinho, who thought he was bound for the United States, not the Etihad — would test the mood of owner Roman Abramovich. ‘I work for him,’ said Mourinho. ‘I cannot knock on his door or call him and ask: “Mr Abramovich, are you happy?” But my feeling is yes. ‘When I see him hugging his kids after a Chelsea goal, it’s easy to understand he’s enjoying it. Everything is positive.’ Surely he is happier than Sheik Mansour, the owner of Manchester City, who has seen his team labour and star players misfire. ‘They are the same as last season,’ said Mourinho, when asked to assess City. ‘They have brought in three or four important players. They have a fantastic squad and are not just the champions, but champions twice in three years. There’s a reason for that. ‘Chelsea have not won the Premier League for a few years now. That is also for some reason.’","Chelsea take on Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday .

"Devin Hester high-stepped into the NFL record book. Matt Ryan had as many touchdown passes as incompletions. Julio Jones made a spectacular over-the-shoulder catch tumbling into the end zone. The result: One of the biggest wins in Atlanta Falcons history. Hester set an NFL record with his 20th return for a touchdown, Ryan threw for 286 yards and three TDs, and Jones hauled in nine passes for 161 yards and a couple of scores to lead the Falcons past the hapless Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 56-14 on Thursday night.

Ryan and the other offensive starters left after Steven Jackson's 3-yard touchdown run made it 49-0 before the midway point of the third quarter. Atlanta had a stunning 56-0 lead heading to the fourth quarter. Tampa Bay scored two meaningless touchdowns to avoid the worst loss in franchise history. 'I've never been in a game quite like this,' Falcons coach Mike Smith said. It was the second-largest win in the Falcons' 48-year history, eclipsed only by 62-7 rout of New Orleans in 1973. It was only the fifth time Atlanta has won by as many as 40 points. Hester and Jones provided the signature moments.

Atlanta running back Steven Jackson tries to emerge from a melee of bodies with the ball as middle linebacker Dane Fletcher grabs hold of his leg . Devonta Freeman breaks past Buccaneers outside linebacker Lavonte David (second left) during the second half of the contest . With the Falcons already ahead 28-0, Hester took a punt at his own 44, found a seam up the middle of the field and easily zipped around the last man with a chance to tackle him, punter Michael Koenen. The 56-yard play was Hester's 20th career return for a touchdown, breaking the mark he shared with former Falcons star Deion Sanders. Sanders, now a television analyst, watched Hester's return from the sideline at the Georgia Dome. Hester high-stepped the last 10 yards are so, his left hand bobbing behind his ear — a tribute to Prime Time's signature move. 'It's tough to break the record of the guy who is my No. 1 mentor,' Hester said. 'I'm kind of emotional right now.' Sanders didn't mind a bit. He smiled broadly and waved to the crowd when he was shown on the video board, the Hall of Famer's record falling in the stadium he once proclaimed as 'my house.' Jones could've made the same claim after his superb 40-yard touchdown catch in the third quarter. Turning toward the sideline, he looked first over his left shoulder for the pass, turned his body when realized it was coming over his right shoulder, juggled the ball a bit as he tumbled into the end zone, cradling it under his arm just before slammed the turf, getting both feet down. Running back Steven Jackson leaps over a pile of bodies as he attempts to carry the ball upfield during the first quarter . Bucs quarterback Mike Glennon tries to recover a fumbled ball - the team came close to their biggest ever franchise defeat . Falcons defensive end Stansly Maponga (right) recovers a fumble as Bucs quarterback Mike Glennon (left) watches on . 'Just a hell of a catch,' Ryan said. 'He's a special talent.' Coming off three interceptions in a loss at Cincinnati, Ryan bounced back with a 21-of-24 showing that set a team record for completion percentage (.875). He also hooked up with Jones on an 8-yard touchdown strike, as well as Harry Douglas on a 3-yarder. 'No one ever doubted that Matt Ryan would come back and have a good game after his game last week,' Smith said. Hester, in his first year with the Falcons, also had a 20-yard touchdown run on an end around, not to mention one of the better defensive plays of the night. After the Bucs stripped the ball away from a Falcons receiver, Hester stripped it right back and fell on the fumble himself to keep possession for Atlanta. 'He channeled some of his inner defense from his college days,' Ryan quipped. The Bucs, losing their first three games for the third time in six years, couldn't do anything right. Josh McCown was 5 of 12 for 58 yards and his fourth interception of the season was returned 23 yards for a touchdown by backup safety Kemal Ishmael. A capacity crowd at the Georgia Dome witnessed a resounding win for the Falcons . The Atlanta Falcons cheerleaders perform during the first half of the football game . Somewhat mercifully, McCown left the game with a thumb injury after appearing to bang his right hand off an Atlanta player's helmet on his final throw of the night. Mike Glennon went the rest of the way at quarterback. 'I thought I had my football team ready to play,' said first-year Bucs coach Lovie Smith. 'Obviously, we weren't ready to play.' The Falcons finished with a 488-217 edge in total yards. The Bucs had five turnovers and 110 yards in penalties on what will surely go down as one of the worst embarrassments for a franchise that knows a thing or two about losing, dropping its first 26 games after entering the NFL in 1976. If not for Danny Lansanah's 27-yard interception return for a touchdown, Tampa Bay would've eclipsed its biggest loss ever, a 48-3 blowout by the San Francisco 49ers in 2011.","Atlanta Falcons romped to one of their biggest wins ever as the hapless Tampa Bay Buccaneers were put to the sword in Thursday night's NFL game at the Georgia Dome .

"David Silva has backed Manchester City to stop Chelsea’s £32million goal machine Diego Costa in his tracks. The two title favourites clash at the Etihad on Sunday when City playmaker Silva will come up against his Spain teammates Costa and Cesc Fabregas. Costa has scored seven goals in four Premier League games since joining Chelsea from Atletico Madrid, but Silva is confident that that champions can become the first team to shut him out in the league. David Silva has backed Manchester City to stop Chelsea’s £32million goal machine Diego Costa in his tracks . Costa scored a hat-trick against Swansea City last weekend and is already on seven goals in a blue shirt . ‘Diego has made a huge impact,’ he said. ‘It is not easy to adapt but he has clearly done it very quickly. ‘He’s scored seven times so far so that record speaks for itself. That’s very important for Chelsea but not that good for us. But we’ve got a good defence and I believe we can stop him on Sunday. ‘I have a very good relationship with both players. I think Chelsea have made some fantastic signings this summer but our friendship will be set aside because we are going out to win. ‘I’ve known Cesc since we were 16-years-old and were in the Spanish youth squads together. ‘I’m looking forward to facing him but in pretty much every game now I seem to be up against a Spanish teammate – when we play Arsenal it’s Santi (Cazorla) or when it’s United it will be Juan Mata. ‘But it’s really all about how the team plays, and our aim as always is to go out and win the game.’ Costa’s impact has seen Chelsea set the early-season pace and they can move eight points ahead of City if they win tomorrow. Silva was talking at an event to raise awareness about Pallister Killian Syndrome (PKS) Costa should be back in the Chelsea starting XI when the teams face each other on Sunday . Silva added: ‘We need to win because otherwise the gap would be getting too big between the clubs.’ Meanwhile, City boss Manuel Pellegrini believes the death of Yaya Toure’s younger brother Ibrahim could be behind his loss of form after the Ivory Coast midfielder was widely criticised following the Champions League defeat to Bayern Munich in midweek. It followed a turbulent summer in which Toure accused the club of not giving him compassionate leave to see his 28-year-old brother who died of cancer in June. ‘Maybe some of you think it’s strange why he is not in the best moment,’ said Pellegrini. ‘But we started the season and maybe he had a lot of personal problems with his brother – not what was said in the media, but in what he feels about it. ‘There are a lot of human things and maybe that is why he is not in his best performance at the moment. I think as a team, as a coach, as a club we must support him because he is a very important player and makes a difference. ‘But he is always being criticised. It is very easy to say he should score 20 goals but must also defend and have better pace, but I don’t think Yaya has any problem. I’m sure he will return to his best.’ Pellegrini added that new £32m centre-back Eliaquim Mangala has not made his debut yet because ‘he needs some time to understand the way we defend’. David Silva was speaking as an ambassador for Anfi, a luxury holiday company based in Gran Canaria who are leading a campaign called ‘A new home for Bailey’. It aims to raise £45,000 so the family of Bailey Stewart, a two-year-old boy with a rare condition that affects only five people in the UK, can adapt their home to meet his special needs.","Chelsea striker Diego Costa has been in blistering form .

"Great Britain captain Leon Smith will be keeping his fingers crossed for a home tie when the draw is made for the 2015 Davis Cup World Group on Thursday. Smith's first seven ties were all at home, with Britain winning six of them to climb from the depths of a Europe/Africa Zone Group II relegation play-off to the brink of the top tier. The Scot's team then won away at Croatia to book their place back in the World Group. Leon Smith will be hoping for a home tie when the draw is made for the 2015 Davis Cup World Group . Britain then stunned the USA in San Diego for their first victory at the elite level of the team competition since 1986 before losing narrowly to Italy in the quarter-finals. All those three ties were on clay and, with it being Andy Murray's weakest surface, Smith knows an away tie would almost certainly mean another outing on the red stuff. Britain are unseeded so will be paired with one of the eight seeds for the first round, which takes place from March 6-8. They are only guaranteed to be away if they draw Novak Djokovic's Serbia, while a tie against Canada would require the drawing of lots. Andy Murray has endured a frustrating year, but will be key to Great Britain's Davis Cup hopes . World No 121 James Ward beat Sam Querrey in this year's Davis Cup clash against the USA . But should Britain draw either of this year's finalists, France or Switzerland, the Czech Republic, Argentina, Italy or USA, they would play at home. The highest-profile home tie under Smith's leadership came in April 2013, when Britain recovered from 2-0 down to defeat Russia at the Ricoh Arena in Coventry. With Murray likely to play and the potential of some of the world's top players coming to visit, a home tie would provide the opportunity to play at a large arena and with the choice of surface up to Smith and his team. Dan Evans reached the 2013 US Open third round but his ranking has plummeted to 269 . The main barrier to further British success in Davis Cup remains the lack of a world-class singles player to support Murray. James Ward, whose win over Sam Querrey was the crucial result in the USA upset, has continued to make steady progress and is ranked at a career-high mark of 121. But Dan Evans, another of Britain's recent Davis Cup heroes, has slumped to 269, and Ward is the only player other than Murray in the top 230. Another option could be world No 144 Aljaz Bedene, who is in the process of applying for a British passport and could be eligible by March. The Slovenian is particularly at home on clay and Smith was keeping a close eye on him at the US Open.","Great Britain Davis Cup captain Leon Smith thinks home advantage is key .
The draw  for the 2015 Davis Cup World Group is made on Thursday .
Andy Murray and co will face either Serbia, France, Switzerland, Czech Republic, Argentina, Italy or USA ."
"Great Britain's Davis Cup team will face a rematch with the United States in the first round of the World Group next March. Britain secured their place at the elite level of the competition for a second consecutive season by upsetting USA in San Diego in February and then lost narrowly to Italy in the quarter-finals. Because Britain played on US soil the last time the two teams met, this tie will be played in Britain from March 6-8. Andy Murray celebrates after beating Sam Querrey to clinch victory for Great Britain against USA in February . USA had been favoured to win the last tie but their choice of clay backfired and James Ward's victory over Sam Querrey coupled with two wins for Andy Murray decided it. A home tie will not necessarily make Britain favourites this time, though, given USA were without number one John Isner last year. Picking a surface will not be that easy for captain Leon Smith and his team given the fast indoor court they have selected for home ties in the past would also suit the US. And the prowess of the Americans' doubles team of Bob and Mike Bryan means whoever is picked as number two singles player - probably Ward - will likely need to win a rubber. James Ward is congratulated by Murray after beating Sam Querrey on the opening day of this year's tie . It will be Britain's first home match since April 2013, when they recovered from a 2-0 deficit to stun Russia at Coventry's Ricoh Arena. It remains to be seen what effect Murray's declaration of support for an independent Scotland will have on his commitment to a British Davis Cup team, although he has always stressed his pride at representing Britain in the past. The 27-year-old played sporadically while Britain were in the lower reaches of the competition but has been an ever-present over the last three ties. Murray's loss to Italy's Fabio Fognini in April was just his second in 19 singles rubbers, and he has committed to playing both singles and doubles to help Britain's cause. His doubles partner in two of the last three ties, fellow Scot Colin Fleming, has also backed independence, as has Murray's brother Jamie, with whom he has previously played in the competition. Murray (6th left) celebrates with the rest of the Great Britain Davis Cup team after victory in Croatia in 2013 . Having said following his Wimbledon victory last summer that he would make his position public despite not having a vote, Murray reversed that in March, citing the long-running fall-out from his 2006 joke about supporting 'anyone but England' Aat the World Cup. However, only a matter of hours before the polls opened, Murray wrote on Twitter: ""Huge day for Scotland today! no campaign negativity last few days totally swayed my view on it. excited to see the outcome. lets do this!"" Murray said during the recent US Open that he would expect to represent Scotland at the Rio Olympics in 2016 should there be a 'yes' vote. The question of what would happen to the Davis Cup team in that instance has not really been addressed, but it could be that a unified British team remains in place. Victory for Britain over the US would mean another home tie against either top seeds France or Germany in July, while the pick of the other first-round ties are derby matches between Argentina and Brazil and Serbia and Croatia.

"Arizona Cardinals running back Jonathan Dwyer head-butted his wife and broke her nose after she refused his sexual advances, and punched her in the face the next day, according to police. The details surfaced in a law enforcement report a day after Dwyer was arrested on aggravated assault charges and deactivated from all team activities after he was taken into custody at the Cardinals' headquarters in Tempe. He spent a night in jail and made a brief court appearance before being released on a $25,000 (£15,200) bond on Thursday. The arrest came at a time when the NFL and its commissioner are under fire for violent, domestic off-the-field encounters involving some of the league's marquee players, including Ray Rice, Adrian Peterson and Greg Hardy. Arizona Cardinals running back Jonathan Dwyer arrested on suspicion of two counts of aggravated assault . Dwyer has been 'deactivated' from Arizona Cardinals' team affairs while investigation takes place . The Cardinals running back is alleged to have committed the two assaults back in July of this year . The NFL has said the Dwyer case will be reviewed under the league's personal-conduct policy. On Thursday, the Cardinals placed Dwyer on the reserve/non-football illness list. A source was quoted as saying said Dwyer was undergoing mental evaluation because of mentions of suicide referred to in police documents. The person asked to remain anonymous because the team had not made the reason for the illness designation public. Because of the designation, Dwyer can't play for the Cardinals again this season. Dwyer was arrested on Wednesday for investigation in two altercations that occurred on July 21 and 22 at his Phoenix residence, just days before the Cardinals reported to training camp. His wife left the state after the incidents, but came forward a week ago after Dwyer apparently sent suicidal text messages including a photo of a knife. In the first encounter, police say Dwyer attempted to kiss and undress his wife, but she refused. A witness reported the assault to police, who showed up at the apartment but did not make an arrest. Dwyer hid in a bathroom and the wife said she hadn't been assaulted and denied he was in the home because the running back threatened to kill himself in front of her and their child if she told police about the assault, police said. The next day, Dwyer punched his wife with a closed fist on the left side of her face, according to police. He also punched walls and threw a shoe at his 17-month-old son, who was not injured, police said. As his wife tried to call police, Dwyer grabbed her cellphone and threw it down from the home's second story. Witnesses told police that Dwyer's wife said, 'I'm calling the police' as she held her swollen face and clutched her son. During his police interview on Wednesday, Dwyer acknowledged hiding in the bathroom when police responded to the first argument and sending a photo of a knife with suicidal threats. Dwyer denied committing an assault, though he acknowledged that he punched walls in his home, threw a phone, and that his wife bit his lip during the disputes, according to the police report. Dwyer (right) is just the latest in a string of high-profile arrests which have hit the NFL this week . Dwyer (left) is escorted by the police after being arrested on suspicion of two counts of aggravated assault . Adrian Peterson has been accused of abusing another of his children, it has been reported. A photo of his four-year-old son (right) shows him suffering a head wound covered by bandages . As he walked out of a downtown Phoenix jail early Thursday, Dwyer said he never hurt his son. During Dwyer's initial court appearance late Wednesday, his attorney, Jared Allen, asked that Dwyer be allowed to leave the state for his job, but a court commissioner denied that request after prosecutor Jay Rademacher said the Cardinals deactivated Dwyer. Dwyer is scheduled for a status conference on Wednesday and a September 26 preliminary hearing. Cardinals coach Bruce Arians said if Dwyer is convicted, he will never play for the team again. If he's exonerated, the team would welcome him back. Arians called domestic violence a worldwide problem. 'If this bad scar on the NFL, as you want to say, right now makes the rest of the world aware of what's going on, it's damn good,' Arians said. This is the second domestic violence case involving a Cardinals player. Inside linebacker Daryl Washington pleaded guilty to assaulting his ex-girlfriend and is serving a year of supervised probation. Washington hasn't been penalized by the NFL for the offense but is suspended for this season for violating the league's substance-abuse policy. Dwyer was booked on counts that include aggravated assault causing a fracture and involving a minor, criminal damage, and preventing the use of a phone in an emergency. Dwyer signed a one-year, $730,000 contract, including a $65,000 bonus, with the Cardinals this year after spending the last four seasons with the Pittsburgh Steelers. He scored a touchdown last week in Arizona's victory over the New York Giants. Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson has been accused of physically abusing his children .

"The National Football League and the union representing its players have agreed to a revised drug policy that includes HGH testing starting this season, the two sides said on Wednesday. The formal agreement, which should see HGH (Human Growth Hormone) testing begin by the end of the month, comes nearly a week after the players' union agreed to terms for a new policy following a vote by player representatives. A first violation of the performance enhancing drug policy, including HGH, will result in a suspension without pay of up to six games depending on the nature of the violation, the NFL and NFL Players Association said in a joint statement. Wes Welker has had his suspension for testing positive for an amphetamine lifted under the new rules . A positive test for diuretics or masking agents will result in a two-game ban while a positive test for a steroid, stimulant or HGH will result in a four-game ban. A second violation of the steroid policy will result in a suspension without pay of 10 games while a third violation will result in banishment for a minimum of two years. The decision to test for HGH comes more than a year after Major League Baseball began testing, and long after many international sports began doing so. Orlando Scandrick of the Dallas Cowboys has also has ban lifted after an amphetamine ban . The NFL also tweaked policies regarding other drugs. Players who test positive for banned stimulants in the offseason will no longer will be suspended but will be referred to the substance abuse program. Players who test positive for stimulants during the season will continue to be banned without pay for four games.","NFL and players union agree to new testing policy .

"After a tough week off the field, the NFL got back to playing — and the focus turned to big-name players who were injured all over the league. Robert Griffin III, Jamaal Charles, DeSean Jackson, A.J. Green and Knowshon Moreno all left their games on a busy Sunday for team trainers and medical staffs. Griffin dislocated his left ankle in the first quarter of Washington's 41-10 victory over Jacksonville, putting his season in jeopardy. The Redskins quarterback was scheduled for X-rays and an MRI to determine more about the injury. He and coach Jay Gruden did not offer a timetable for a return, but the injury typically sidelines NFL players for at least two months. Robert Griffin III is carted off at FedEx Field after suffering a dislocated left ankle . Robert Griffin III hobbles along on crutches after his injury against Jacksonville . 'Moments like this,' Griffin said, 'you just have to keep the faith.' If there is also a fracture, Griffin will need surgery and will almost certainly be done for the year. He was hurt when he landed awkwardly on his ankle as he finished the throw and then tumbled out of bounds. The pass was caught by Jackson for an 11-yard gain. 'It's an excruciating pain,' Griffin said. 'Anytime you look at your ankle and it's going in a strange direction, you don't want to get up.' Jackson also left the game shortly after he sprained the AC joint in his left shoulder in the first quarter. He hoped to be able to play next week against Philadelphia, his former club. Knowshon Moreno injured his elbow in Miami Dolphins' defeat at Buffalo Bills . Other Redskins players injured included running back Roy Helu (strained quadriceps), guard Shawn Lauvao (sprained right knee) and fullback Darrel Young (sprained back). Jaguars tight end Marcedes Lewis was carted off after leaving with a high left ankle sprain. Rookie receiver Allen Hurns injured his left ankle and was scheduled for X-rays. In Denver, Charles left with a left ankle injury after being brought down in the first quarter against the Broncos, and would not return. Charles was stopped on a run up the middle by Broncos safety T.J. Ward and then hobbled to the bench. Green aggravated an injured toe during the Cincinnati Bengals' opening series and sat out the rest of the game, a 24-10 win over Atlanta. Green missed practice time during the week with an injured toe on his right foot. He started against the Falcons, but came to the sideline after a few plays to have the foot examined. He walked off without assistance, limping slightly. Jamaal Charles left Kansas City's game against the Denver Broncos early with an injury . The Washington Redskins also lost DeSean Jackson to injury during their win over Jacksonville . The Bengals lost four more players: Pro Bowl linebacker Vontaze Burfict (pinched nerve in his neck), defensive tackle Brandon Thompson (left knee), tight end Alex Smith (left biceps) and right guard Kevin Zeitler (right calf). At Orchard Park, New York, Moreno didn't return after injuring his left elbow 11 minutes into Miami's 29-10 loss to the Bills. He was hurt on his first carry, a 4-yard gain, when he was initially hit on the right side by Nickell Robey, and Nigel Bradham then struck him from the left, hitting him directly in the arm. Tennessee cornerback Jason McCourty injured a groin muscle and missed the second half of the Titans' 26-10 loss at home to Dallas. Arizona quarterback Carson Palmer was ruled out against the New York Giants on Sunday because of a shoulder injury. After he was limited at practice all week, he was replaced by Drew Stanton, an eight-year veteran who had four previous career starts. Stanton went 14 of 19 for 167 yards and led the Cardinals on three long scoring drives in a 25-14 victory. Giants cornerback Walter Thurmond left in the second half of the loss with a pectoral injury, and middle linebacker Jon Beason went out with a toe injury. Tampa Bay running back Doug Martin sat out the Buccaneers' game against St. Louis because of a knee injury. Meanwhile, Rams quarterback Shaun Hill was active after being limited in practice with a thigh injury, but third-stringer Austin Davis got the start.","Robert Griffin III leaves Washington's win over Jacksonville Jaguars .

"Didier Drogba told Chelsea supporters Frank Lampard will always belong to them and urged those travelling to Sunday's title clash against Manchester City not to turn on the club legend and record goalscorer. Lampard is on loan the Etihad Stadium from New York City, the MLS team owned by City which he joined in the summer after 13 years at Stamford Bridge. 'It doesn't matter what team he is playing for now,' said Drogba. 'He belongs to us. He is a Chelsea player, for what he did. He made the crowd shout and cheer his name and cheer for us, a lot of times here. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch... If selected, Frank Lampard will face Chelsea on Sunday after 13 years service at Stamford Bridge . Didier Drogba has urged the Chelsea faithful to show Lampard due respect at the Etihad . 'It's a pity that I've come back and he's not here anymore but I know for sure I will be happy to see him again. I can't wait to see my partner in crime. 'He's part of the history of this club and the fans know what he gave for the club. They know what he did. So I know the reaction will be good. I know that, for sure.' Drogba, 36, is a Chelsea player once again after two years away. He returned last season to play against Jose Mourinho's team for Galatasaray in the Champions League. He received a rapturous ovation from fans at the Bridge and found it hard to cope with the emotion, as will Lampard if he plays at the Etihad on Sunday. 'I did it and so I know it's going to be difficult,' said Drogba. 'But I know Frank and he will do his best.' Lampard, also 36, made his City last weekend in a 1-1 draw at Arsenal and was an unused substitute against Bayern Munich on Wednesday. If Manuel Pellegrini selects him on Sunday, it will be his first involvement against Chelsea since March 2001, when he was in a West Ham team beaten at Upton Park. Lampard struggled on debut for City, where he's on loan before joining New York City in the MLS . The former England and Chelsea star got a yellow card and was substituted at half-time against Arsenal . In 13 years at Chelsea, he won 11 major trophies: the Barclays Premier League three times, the FA Cup four times, the League Cup twice, the Europa League once and the Champions League. He also scored a record 211 goals for the club. Most of the trophies – and many of the goals - involved Drogba, who has returned to the Bridge in a role as player-coach as manager Jose Mourinho attempted to replace some of the experience and winning mentality lost when Lampard and Ashley Cole left the club. 'It's good to be back,' said Drogba, who started the first game since his return in the 1-1 draw against Schalke, in the Champions League, on Wednesday. He has been in pain from an ankle injury suffered in pre-season which has restricted his involvement and accepts there is pressure on him to somehow emulate his first spell at the club, which ended in sensational style when he scored the winning penalty in the shoot-out to win the Champions League final. 'The pressure you get is when you win something,' said Drogba. 'When we won the Premier League for the first time, the pressure was to win it a second time. When I finished as the top scorer in the Premier League, they expected me to be top scorer the next season. That's part of our lives, and we're used to it. Drogba and Lampard celebrate one of their many successes together at Chelsea . Loyal servant Lampard as he was farewelled from the Bridge in May with a record 211 goals for the club . 'It's a different season for me but when I signed to come back here I knew that. I can only work hard and show the manager like I did on Wednesday. I need to do that improve my condition. 'I'm preparing myself to give something extra to the team and achieve what we want to achieve. I'm here to help but I'm also here to show them the right spirit, if I can say that. Even if I don't have any doubt about their desire to win, I'm here to help and I will give what I can.' Another key part of his role will be as mentor to Diego Costa, the £32million centre-forward who has started his Chelsea career with a blaze of seven goals in five appearances, and has many similarities to the Ivorian in his style of play and his life story. 'He's the striker we needed this season,' said Drogba. 'For him to start the season in England, coming from Spain, which is a very different league, and to recreate the same thing he was doing at Atletico Madrid, is fantastic. He's really good and he's enjoying being with us. That's the best feeling he could have. 'Like me, he came to this level a little bit late. When I look at him, I can see the desire to win every challenge, to score goals. He is hungry for goals and that's the best thing for a team like us.' If Costa's hamstrings are up to it, he will return in place of Drogba at City where a win will move Chelsea seven points clear of the champions after only five games. 'I hope we can continue the way we've started in the Premier League against City,' said Drogba. 'I think we can and I hope we can. We will go there to try to win, like we've gone out to try to win every game this season. Let's see what's going to happen. The season is long.'","Didier Drogba says Frank Lampard will always belong to Chelsea .

"Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini has confirmed that Frank Lampard will be in the squad to face his old club Chelsea on Sunday and tried to defuse any potential issues by reminding supporters that it was not his choice to leave Stamford Bridge. Chelsea ended Lampard’s 13-year stay at the club this summer when he was released at the end of his contract, and the former England midfielder caused widespread surprise by signing for City having agreed to play for their affiliate club New York City FC in Major League Soccer next year. Pellegrini was quick to point out that the 36-year-old would still be at Stamford Bridge if he had the choice, and should not be criticised for extending his career elsewhere.

"Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli is never far from the headlines - but this time it's for all the right reasons, as the dog-loving Italian appears to have given generously to Manchester Dogs' Home. Last Thursday, 60 dogs were killed in a fire at the rescue centre, and staff suspect that a princely five-figure donation has come from the account of Balotelli, the Liverpool Echo reports. The Italian international has a history with the home, previously volunteering there during his time at Manchester City by walking their dogs while his own pet was in quarantine ahead of a move to England. Balotelli regularly posts pictures of his dog 'Lucky' to social media . Balotelli scored his first goal for Liverpool against Ludogorets on Tuesday night . Jane Smith, a spokeswoman for the dogs' home, said: 'Mario own a dog but it was in quarantine so he used to come and walk all the dogs. 'We can't yet confirm whether he made a donation but he is known as a big dog lover so it would make sense.' The 24-year-old is well-known for his love of dogs, and regularly posts pictures of his own dog 'Lucky' on social media. The extravagant Italian's love of dogs went as far as requesting if Lucky could partake in City's FA Cup-winning parade around Manchester, which the club duly obliged.

"Emmanuel Adebayor has admitted that Tottenham’s inability to win matches they dominate could cost them dear by the end of the season. Spurs’ mental fragility as well as defensive lapses were all too evident at the Stadium of Light — even though they played some delightful football. The lead provided by Nacer Chadli’s second-minute goal lasted 74 seconds before Adam Johnson was allowed through to level. Christian Eriksen restored the advantage only for team-mate Harry Kane to lose concentration as the ball bounced off him for an own-goal equaliser. Harry Kane looks on in despair as the ball ricochets off him for the own goal that denied Spurs three points . Christian Eriksen celebrates putting Tottenham back in the lead early in the second half . Adebayor is concerned that Spurs cannot see out games. He said: ‘If it happens a lot then yes, it is worrying. The most frustrating thing is that we weren’t rewarded for our performance. If you play badly and draw then it is quite good, as I am sure the Sunderland players will tell you. Their manager won’t be able to believe they came away with a point.’ Of Tottenham’s 15 shots, six were blocked, four saved, three were off target (two hitting the woodwork), and two went in. Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino said he needed to analyse what happened before commenting in detail on what went wrong. A lack of clinical finishing, some frantic Sunderland defending, a good display from host keeper Vito Mannone and some sloppy defending is what he’ll find. ‘(A draw) is difficult to take after dominating the game,’ Adebayor added. ‘But we will watch it again and see where we went wrong because when you have so much of a game and don’t win, it means something has gone wrong.’ Mauricio Pochettino (left) said he would look at a tape of the game before discussing where it went wrong . Emmanuel Adebayor was annoyed at his side's inability to finish off the game in which they dominated . Johnson conceded Spurs were the better team. ‘They were very good for sustained periods, and we had to battle out there,’ said the midfielder. ‘They didn’t cut us open all the time but had periods of possession in front of our box. We defended quite well, considering the pressure they put us under. We showed character to stay in the game and get a point.’ Johnson’s manager, Gus Poyet, who played 98 times for Spurs between 2001 and 2004, was delighted with a point — and rightly so. He said it had been a ‘tough, tough day’. Adam Johnson scored an excellent goal admitted that his side had been second best on the balance of play . ‘I think they’ve got everything,’ he said of Tottenham. ‘On another day, they could have scored a couple of goals in a row and the game could have been over with 20 minutes left. But that’s the difference between winning and not getting three points. ‘It comes down to little things, like in the last minute Eriksen not being on the pitch to take a free kick. 'In the end, Will (Buckley) could have scored and imagine if we had taken all three points — Spurs would have been devastated, but that’s football.’ Sunderland manager Gus Poyet said if his team had stolen a winner Spurs would have been devastated .","Tottenham dominated the game but couldn't secure three points .

"Arsenal were boosted with the return of Jack Wilshere and appeared to be in good spirits in training ahead of their game against Aston Villa on Saturday. Wilshere suffered an ankle injury in the Gunners' 2-0 defeat by Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday but the midfielder was back with the rest of his team-mates ahead of the game at Villa Park. Transfer deadline day signing Danny Welbeck was seen messing around with fellow England star Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, with the midfielder seen climbing on the former Manchester United striker's back. Jack Wilshere (left) joined team mates Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (centre) and Santi Cazorla (right) for some sprints .

German midfielder Mesut Ozil holds his hands out whilst training, having been highly criticised for his performances in the Arsenal red . Prior to the training session, Arsene Wenger hit back at the critics of Mesut Ozil in his press conference, after the German failed to impress yet again during Arsenal's defeat in Dortmund on Tuesday night. 'Why should he be a scapegoat? For what? We've lost one game since April 1,' said Wenger. 'Let's be realistic. We've come out of a very difficult preparation period with decisive games. We had very difficult games against Besiktas. I don't know a scapegoat for what? 'What is difficult to manage today is that everybody knows absolutely everything and everybody judges people definitely on one game. You have to accept that football is played by human beings who have ups and downs like you have in your life.' There has been the suggestion that Ozil's poor form is due to his manager playing him on the right, out of his most effective position.The Frenchman saw this as a side issue, however. 'That's a secondary debate in my opinion because he has freedom to play when we have the ball and go where he wants,' he added. If you look at the heat map where he plays, you will be amazed where he is all over the pitch.'

Summer signing Alexis Sanchez (left) holds a low sense of gravity as he is challenged in training ahead of the Gunners' game against Paul Lambert's Villa on Saturday . Wenger also addressed the FA's proposal to cut the number of players from outside the EU. He believes that this should be carefully considered to avoid compromising the quality of the English game. FA chairman Greg Dyke's England Commission has outlined a series of recommendations to reduce the number of overseas players by up to 50 per cent, including banning clubs sending such players out on loan, preventing Football League clubs from signing them and making the appeals process much tougher. 'I read what he (Greg Dyke) said and honestly I am for the competition worldwide, but he has a point that it is difficult to get non-EU players in the youth system and then to loan them out. That's where he has a point,' said Wenger. 'You want the best players in the world to be here, but if you go for them you cannot take them and loan them out somewhere else. Maybe he has a point there. 'Do they take room in the education of the young English players? I don't think so. It is a deep debate and it is very difficult to have a definite opinion. 'What is for sure is you do not want artificial protection of the mediocrity and that's where you have to be very careful because this is a job where we're very well paid, therefore you want top, top quality. 'You want to be the best Premier League in the world so you want to be top quality and open to the best players in the world, but the best way to respond and to fulfil all the expectation of the FA is to produce good top quality young players. England is on its way but there is still a job to do.'","Jack Wilshere trains with Arsenal following return from injury .

"Paul Lambert had just finished holding court when he spun on his heels and made his way out of Anfield’s press auditorium. Aston Villa’s manager grabbed at the handle of the first door he saw and immediately marched through it before he had to abruptly halt. The door in question led into a pantry and, with a wry smile, he was forced to double back. It was the only wrong move he made all day. In the moments beforehand, Lambert had conducted himself with class and dignity. There was no boasting or revelling in a triumph over Liverpool but it was clear from spending time in his company that this was a man bursting with pride at a job well done. Paul Lambert's young Aston Villa side beat Liverpool 1-0 at Anfield thanks to a Gabby Agbonlahor goal . No wonder. Lambert enjoys visiting Anfield — in five trips with Celtic (as a player), Norwich and Villa, he has yet to be beaten — but there was more to this than merely savouring Gabby Agbonlahor’s solitary strike. Here, he felt, was a performance to show his side are coming of age. ‘These young players have become men this season,’ said Lambert, extolling the displays in particular of Nathan Baker and Ashley Westwood. ‘If they can grow together and we get one or two back from injury we’ll be really strong.’ The last few years have been fallow at Villa Park and Lambert has had to ride some punches but, suddenly, things appear to be falling into place. Paul Lambert has yet to be beaten at Anfield either as a player or manager despite making five trips there . Liverpool might have dominated possession but Lambert had Villa immaculately drilled. Baker, for one, marshalled his defence, Westwood held the midfield together with exemplary passing and, around him, Tom Cleverley, Kieran Richardson and Andreas Weimann buzzed with intent. ‘It is early days but the chairman’s come out and said what he’s said (about selling),’ Lambert continued. ‘Everybody knows the situation and that’s helped. It’s galvanised the supporters who’ve been brilliant since I’ve been here. Andreas Weimann (left), Ashley Westwood, Keiran Richardson and Tom Cleverley impressed against Liverpool . ‘Since the start of the season we have been fantastic. This is another clean sheet. But it’s a long road. ’ Retaining perspective won’t be an issue. Lambert deals in pragmatism, while his assistant, Roy Keane, emerged from the dugout at key moments, growling at Villa’s midfielders to retain their focus. If all was right in the world for Lambert, the same could not be said for Brendan Rodgers. Liverpool’s defending continues to alarm and questions persist over the suitability of Simon Mignolet and Mamadou Sakho to this project. Gabby Agbonlahor's goal early in the first half was enough to give Aston Villa a well-deserved victory . The goal Liverpool conceded was wretched, a sequence of errors — first from Sakho conceding a corner, then from Dejan Lovren — allowed Philippe Senderos to cause havoc before Agbonlahor pounced. If they are to progress domestically and in Europe, they must be more robust. ‘We have to defend better,’ said Rodgers. ‘Just defend — don’t try and be clever. The worst-case scenario when we have days when we are not creative we get a point and move on. It’s disappointing we didn’t.’ Super Stat: This was a rare victory for Villa’s defence in front of the Kop — the first time in 14 visits that they have kept a clean sheet.

"Roberto Martinez has launched a defence of the much-maligned Europa League and called it ‘stupid’ to suggest Everton are not intent on winning the competition. Premier League managers have often hinted that European football’s second-tier tournament is a nuisance clogging the fixture list, but Martinez believes Goodison Park thrives on such nights. Everton claimed their first league victory of the season and now welcome Wolfsburg to Merseyside on Thursday as they make their way through seven matches in 23 days. Roberto Martinez has launched a defence of the Europa League and claimed Everton are aiming to win it . ‘Last year we had to work so hard for 38 games to achieve that, it would be nonsense to say we don’t want to be giving it everything we’ve got,’ he said. ‘As long as people understand that making changes to the line-up doesn’t mean you don’t care about a competition. We really want to go all the way in the Europa League.’ Lille and Russian side Krasnodar are also in Group H. ‘We’re excited because those teams will bring a completely different tactical approach and we will benefit from that,’ added Martinez. ‘Everton have to be in Europe. It is a priority for us. Maybe we were not ready for the Champions League, even though we fought hard to get into it. This is the perfect next step for us.’ Romelu Lukaku scored for Everton against West Brom, with whom he spent a season on loan . For Alan Irvine, the landscape is more modest. Albion’s new head coach is still searching for his first win, and after Romelu Lukaku and Kevin Mirallas scored, he had to endure jeers from his own fans. But Irvine asked for time as he tries to mould together a squad which has 11 new faces. Georgios Samaras and Sebastian Blanco came on for their debuts but Joleon Lescott is yet to play because of injury. ‘You can’t throw a team together overnight,’ he said. ‘But I understand that you can’t lose games too often, and that if you do, then it becomes extremely difficult. Belgian forward Kevin Mirallas doubled Everton's lead in the second half at The Hawthorns . 'I’ll keep working to get the lads gelled into the best team we can be as quickly as possible.’ Captain Chris Brunt was booed by sections of Albion supporters as he was substituted in unsavoury scenes reminiscent of last season. ‘It is ridiculous that somebody who has been an incredible servant to this club gets that,’ raged Ben Foster, at fault for Mirallas’s goal. ‘We need our supporters to support us.’ SUPER STAT: Romelu Lukaku scored his first Premier League goal for a club that owns him; his previous 32 had all been while he was out on loan .

"It will be a new-look Liverpool that returns to the Champions League to great anticipation this week but such is the reputation of Anfield on European nights, the class of 2014 know expectations will be sky-high among their supporters. Philippe Coutinho, one of the club’s new generation with the difficult task of following Kevin Keegan, David Fairclough, Kenny Dalglish and Luis Garcia into European folklore, can feel the tingle of excitement ahead of Tuesday night’s game with Bulgarian side Ludogorets, with glamour ties against Real Madrid and Basle to come. But he warns it is also the job of Brendan Rodgers’ squad to let the fans soak up the emotion, while they deal with the reality of playing in Europe’s premier competition after a five-year absence. Philippe Coutinho is relishing playing in the Champions League for Liverpool at Anfield . ‘I’ve heard all about the experience of playing at Anfield in the Champions League – I can’ t wait for it to happen,’ he says. ‘When we come out with the floodlights turned on, it will be more like appearing at a show or a concert than a football match. The atmosphere at our stadium was fantastic last year when the fans would gather to wait for our team bus to arrive, and this will be different, and maybe even better. ‘I know about Liverpool’s tradition in the competition, so hopes will be high. But considering Liverpool as one of the favourites for the Champions League before we kick a ball is something for the fans, not for the team. ‘I believe that we have a strong squad, new players have been brought in and we are in a good position to perform well in the Champions League, but without calling ourselves favourites or anything like that.’ Brendan Rodgers has been preparing his Liverpool squad for their Champions League return . The likes of Lazar Markovic (centre) and Mario Balotelli (right), among others, were brought in to add depth . Coutinho is right to be cautious in his optimism. Only four survivors – Steven Gerrard, Martin Skrtel, Lucas and Glen Johnson - are left at Anfield from their last Champions League campaign in 2009/10 when they were knocked out of the group stage after defeats against Stevan Jovetic’s Fiorentina, and Lyon who had Hugo Lloris in goal. Of the quartet, only Gerrard is likely to start this week, and he added to the anticipation by attending last week’s premier of a new film “One Night in Istanbul” about the club’s legendary fifth European Cup triumph against AC Milan in Istanbul in 2005. The number of Champions League debutants in Rodgers’ likely line-up leaves Coutinho, at the age of 22, as one of Liverpool’s more experienced European players. He was just 18 when he played in the Champions League for then-holders Inter Milan, including the two matches against Spurs that made Gareth Bale famous. Steven Gerrard celebrates a famous goal against Olympiakos at Anfield in 2004 . His hero growing up in Brazil, Ronaldinho, won the trophy with Barcelona and he remembers feeling sorry at the time for Kaka when his AC Milan team were defeated by Liverpool in Istanbul in the 2005 final. ‘We are confident we can go through to the next round but we know it’ll be difficult. Not just against Real Madrid, but the other two teams as well. ‘It’s Champions League so of course it is going to be tough. But we are looking forward to getting off to a good start with the fans behind us. Then we will look at it game by game and see if we can get through to the next round. ‘Of course, I’m well aware Liverpool have won the trophy a number of times. The players are very motivated and excited to be in the Champions League. It’s not only important for the fans to be back in the Champions League, but also important for the players. ‘We want to get off to a good start next week and have other good matches along the way. ‘The Champions League has become a famous tournament in Brazil, people are watching it as much as Brazilian football. For me, it is certainly an inspiration.’ Coutinho and new Liverpool signing Mario Balotelli crossed paths for a couple of weeks at the San Siro, Coutinho arriving from Brazil just as the striker was getting ready to leave for Manchester City. But the midfielder, recently drafted into the Brazil squad after being left out of the World Cup by Felipe Scolari, names another team-mate he thinks will take Europe by storm. Liverpool supporters at the Kop end come alive on a big European night at Anfield . Liverpool parade the 2005 Champions League outside Anfield that they won in dramatic fashion in Istanbul . ‘It is likely Raheem Sterling will be one of our stars,’ he says without hesitation about the new golden boy of English football. ‘He is having a very good time and is in very good shape. I believe he will do quite well in the Champions League, he’s very fast – I know I don’t have the speed to catch him! ‘I’ve not been surprised at all by his performances this season, including for England. We train together every day so I know his potential. I’m confident this will be a good season for him.’ Liverpool’s surprise title challenge last season was mounted without the distraction of midweek European football. Brendan Rodgers has signed eight players in the summer to try and cope with the dual demands and Coutinho doesn’t think it will harm the club’s results. ‘I think the more big matches we have, the more motivated we will feel,’ he said. ‘I don’t feel it will be a problem to play in both competitions at the same time.’ Coutinho’s quick feet and match intelligence have already made him a natural fit for Liverpool’s famed pass-and-move style. The last two English clubs to have won the Champions League, Chelsea and Manchester United, both had a Brazilian member of their victorious squad; David Luiz and Anderson. Rodgers and The Kop will hope good things come in threes.","Liverpool begin Champions League campaign against Ludogorets .

"Jack Wilshere has revealed that the Arsenal squad want to win the Champions League as a ‘thank you’ to manager Arsene Wenger, who has yet to win Europe’s biggest club prize in his 31-year managerial career. Wenger reached the Champions League semi-final with Monaco in 1994 and the 2006 final, when 10-man Arsenal led Barcelona 1-0 after having Jens Lehmann sent off, before conceding two late goals to lose 2-1. Despite qualifying for the tournament a record 17 consecutive years in a row with Arsenal, Wenger has never won it. Instead he has watched his great rivals Sir Alex Ferguson and Jose Mourinho pick up the trophy twice, while Roberto Di Matteo won the trophy with Chelsea at his first attempt in 2012 and Pep Guardiola won it twice within three years of taking up management. Like our Arsenal Facebook page . Jack Wilshere says Arsenal want to win the Champions League for manager Arsene Wenger . Jack Wilshere scores past Joe Hart during Arsenal's 2-2 draw with Manchester City on Saturday . And Wilshere says that the Arsenal team want to set the record straight for Wenger. ‘For him, that would be the icing on the cake if you like,’ said Wilshere. ‘He has been 17 years and had one final — he came close to winning that, he was unlucky, he had Lehmann sent off — so I think this is the one he really, really wants, as well as the Premier League, because he wants it for us. But if he gives the Champions League to us it will also be like a present [from us] to him if we win the Champions League.’ Arsenal start their campaign at 2013 finalists Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday, a fixture which has become familiar in recent years, with the teams being drawn together in 2011 and 2013, with Arsenal recording an impressive 1-0 win in Dortmund but losing a 2-1 at The Emirates, a result which cost them top spot in the group. Arsene Wenger is yet to win the Champions League during his long managerial career . Wilshere said: ‘Between us two, they are always good games and they will be thinking the same. They won’t want to be coming to us again even though they won here last year, we won there. It is a tough game and we go there first and it’s almost like the England game against Switzerland if you like; the hardest game in the group will be the first one and we can almost put a marker down in that game by saying we’re here to win this group. ‘I think that’s the target at the start. We always said that. Over the last few seasons we almost thought we were finishing top and we lost the last game and it has cost us. ‘We have really been unlucky with the draw over the last few years, with Bayern Munich twice, they’re the best team in Europe for me, so we could have had anyone else and had a little bit more of a chance of going through, but, as you said, it is really important to finish top of the group.’ Thierry Henry collects his medal after Arsenal were beaten by Barcelona in the 2006 Champions League final .

"On Saturday evening, when Raheem Sterling walks out of his favourite club, he should settle for a quiet night in to watch El Clasico. After Hull at home he should put his feet up to watch two of the best left wingers in world football play in the biggest fixture going. Cristiano Ronaldo versus Neymar will be an education. After Sterling’s nocturnal visit to London’s trendy Cirque le Soir in London, just 24 hours after England’s victory over Estonia, the most important club in his career is Liverpool. Cristiano Ronaldo is an established star at Real Madrid, while Raheem Sterling is Liverpool's emerging force . Ronaldo and Sterling, the key men for their teams, shake hands before kick off at Anfield . Ronaldo finishes off James Rodriguez's ball through brilliantly to give Real Madrid the lead at Anfield . Sterling bemoans what he percieved to be an early foul close to the edge of Real Madrid's box . The attitude of a superstar, a genuine world beater, is to put all that stuff off until he is finished with football in his mid-thirties. That’s what Ronaldo did when he committed his mind, body and soul to the sport when he arrived at Manchester United at the age of 17. Look how it has paid off. On Wednesday night, in the seductive colours of the ten time European champions Real Madrid, Ronaldo taught Sterling how to play that role down the left. In short he was magnificent and was clapped off by the Liverpool fans when he was substituted. When Karim Benzema scored Real’s third, Sterling stood hands on hips and wondered out loud how Liverpool could ever get a grip on this game. This is the world’s best football team and it was a privilege to watch them take Liverpool apart in this Champions League group game. When one cog in the wheel of the world’s best football team isn’t functioning, they simply turn to another expensive piece of machinery to do the job. Sterling tries to break his way past Alvaro Arbeloa but it was a frustrating first half for him . Sterling tries to give Pepe a difficult time as he brings the ball forward in a Liverpool counter-attack . Ronaldo, Toni Kroos, James Rodriguez, Isco and Luka Modric turned the screw at will. Liverpool? They just feed Sterling. It is impossible to rely on him alone, to think that a kid of 19 can handle the responsibility and pressure of trying to win a game against one of the best club teams we have ever seen. To his credit, Brendan Rodgers is doing his best to shield him from the spotlight after a series of events that would affect even the most stable teenager. ‘It comes with his rise that people might want to knock him, but he is focused,’ claimed Liverpool’s manager. ‘For Raheem Sterling, at 19 years of age and six days before a game, people are saying he can’t go out? That’s not right.’ At least Sterling was willing, running his guts out down the left and trying to make up for losing possession by haring back down the touchline. There was admiration from Carlo Ancelotti, the man who made the European Cup happen last season on that dramatic night against Atletico Madrid in Estadio da Luz. Click here for our brilliant match zone, including all the players' heat maps . Sterling's heat map shows he did most of his work down the left-hand side of the pitch and had an influence .

Ronaldo guides his shot past Simon Mignolet to give Real Madrid the lead in the first half . And then the Portuguese star celebrates in front of the Anfield crowd after his first goal at the ground . VIDEO Barcelona next on Ronaldo's hit-list . ‘The position of Sterling and sometimes Balotelli was important, they tried to attack us and they were dangerous,’ admitted Ancelotti. ‘After we scored the three goals they were a little bit down mentally and it was easier for us.’ The fact that Sterling was probably Liverpool’s most influential player on this wretched night for Brendan Rodgers and his teams says so much about his standing in this team. There will come a time when Sterling controls the Liverpool tempo again, learning to juggle his responsibilities to club and country as he makes his way through the game. ‘Raheem was playing in a position that was a little bit alien to him,’ added Rodgers. ‘He coped well and he did well.’ Sterling must learn from the likes of Ronaldo and co with the pressure on him now amplified . There were shouts, legitimate ones, that he should have earned a free-kick when he drew a foul from Alvaro Arbeloa on the edge of the area after six minutes. The Kop were off their seats in expectation again midway through the first half when he somehow held on to the ball and made his way towards the byline. He made enough room to swing his left peg at it and get a decent enough cross over, but Liverpool were afraid to commit. You sensed that Real Madrid would be rampant here and they were. Young players, no matter how outrageous their talent, cannot carry their teams in times of trouble. It is too much to ask of them. Sterling is young and inexperienced, and it is a man’s job to guide a team through a crisis. Ronaldo gave Glen Johnson twisted blood down the left flank and had all the room in the world to cut in . He made enough room for himself to swing his left peg at it and get a decent enough cross over, but Liverpool were afraid to commit. You sensed that Real Madrid would be rampant here and they were. Young players, no matter how outrageous their talent, cannot carry their teams in times of trouble. It is too much to ask of them. He did ok, nothing special here. Real Madrid were far too good to let Sterling, or any other Liverpool player for that matter, make an impact on this game. The one time he got away in the first half he drew a foul from Toni Kroos, a clumsy challenge that earned the German midfielder a booking. Ronaldo celebrates making the difference for Real in the first half - while Sterling watched on . Ronaldo unleashes one of six shots he had during his time on the pitch before being subbed off . Still, what a place to learn. He discovered how cute defenders are at the very highest level when Pepe pinched the ball off his toes at the start of the second half. In the Premier League he would have held on to the ball and been able to spin off his marker. There was no chance of Pepe letting him get away with that here. Even after the break, when Rodgers switched his tactics and played without a recognised central striker, Real Madrid were impenetrable. Arbeloa, who kept Sterling subdued, will be marking Neymar at the weekend when Barcelona arrive at the Bernabeu for the primero Clasico of the season. No-one, not even Raheem, can tire of watching Real Madrid. Ronaldo rises at the near post to head away a Liverpool corner and help ease defensive worries for Real .

"Jose Mourinho is furious with the Spanish Football Federation after star striker Diego Costa was ruled out of Saturday’s clash at Crystal Palace through injury. Costa, the leading scorer in the Barclays Premier League with nine goals, returned to Chelsea on Monday after playing for Spain in two Euro 2016 qualifiers. Mourinho had publicly asked Spain coach Vicente del Bosque to use the international break to rest the forward, but he ignored the Chelsea boss and last night it was unclear for how long the striker would be sidelined. Costa scored his first international goal in the 4-0 victory over Luxembourg. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Crystal Palace vs Chelsea preview . Diego Costa celebrates sealing the 2-0 win for Chelsea against Arsenal at Stamford Bridge earlier this month . Costa is set to be sidelined for three weeks with a hamstring injury after returning from international duty . Costa played all but eight minutes for the national team last week and Mourinho revealed: 'Yes. The Spanish team played in Luxembourg on Sunday. I gave them Diego, Fabregas and Azpilicueta. 'I gave them two days off, Monday and Tuesday, so they had to report to train on Wednesday at 3pm. And Diego was here Monday at 9am. So you can imagine how strong he was to be here at 9am on Monday.' The Chelsea boss added: ‘I don’t lose my time contacting managers from national teams. In the past they used to contact me, but it is never my initiative to contact national team coaches. The Spanish striker played against Slovakia (pictured) and Luxembourg during the international break . ‘They have the power, we don’t have the power. 'Every Chelsea player who is selected at that time, we are happy that the players represent their country.' Ramires, Andre Schurrle, John Obi Mikel and Didier Drogba could also miss the trip to Selhurst Park as Mourinho admitted Chelsea have a 'long, long' injury list.

"The temptation is to believe that Diego Costa can be rebuilt and will run out at Old Trafford on Sunday in a Chelsea shirt. Time is tight, just like Costa’s hamstrings, but the reality is that he will miss the biggest match of the season so far. On Tuesday night, as Chelsea cantered to victory in this Champions League clash with Maribor, they lost Loic Remy after just 13 minutes at Stamford Bridge. His groin is done. He could also be out. VIDEO Scroll down to watch We are playing with confidence - Mourinho . Didier Drogba makes no mistake from the penalty spot to score Chelsea's second goal .

In his place came Didier Drogba, given an uproarious reception by the 40,000 Chelsea fans who turned out to watch this Group G clash against the kings of Slovenian football. They have been dethroned. The serious business is Sunday, when Jose Mourinho must pick a team to protect Chelsea’s unbeaten record in the Barclays Premier League. ‘I have forbidden the doctor from calling me on my day off,’ claimed Mourinho. ‘I will worry about Manchester United on Thursday. ‘We don’t cry about injuries, it just represents an opportunity for another player. I don’t like to speak about injured players. ‘It's our philosophy, we don't cry. In this moment we have some problems with players who are not available to play. ‘We will prepare the game Thursday, Friday, Saturday to try to be at our best possible level against an opponent which we respect very, very much.’ Loic Remy scores the opening goal for Chelsea in their 6-0 victory against NK Maribor on Tuesday . Remy (second right) pulls up injured after opening the scoring for his side at Stamford Bridge . Remy leaves the pitch injured just moments after scoring for Chelsea against Maribor . Last season, when they travelled to United for David Moyes’ first home game in charge of the champions, he played without a striker. This time, now that Chelsea are playing football on the front foot and battering everything in sight, he will travel to Old Trafford in search of goals. This team knows no other way. Now that Drogba has his first goal back in English football after galavanting around the world, first with Shanghai Shenhua and then with Galatasary, he could get the nod. Without Costa, spending his days on the treatment table, or Remy there are no realistic alternatives. Drogba offers experience and confidence.

He did score, as everyone knew he would, by sending Maribor keeper Jasmin Handanovic the wrong way. It was good to see him back on the scoresheet. ‘If the coach wants me I am available,’ admitted Drogba. ‘It was good for my confidence to score, but I am happy because we share the goals around in this team. ‘We have a lot of young players in the team, but we have more quality than we had the last time I was here.’ Drogba was down to play 30 minutes against Maribor, but he ended up on the pitch for a lot longer after Remy pulled up after just 13 minutes.

Those legs are still willing, even at the age of 36, but it is a big call for Mourinho to make now. Costa is the joint leading goalscorer (with Sergio Aguero) in the Premier League and his presence in the Chelsea side on Sunday would shake that United defence. Under van Gaal they are a vulnerable bunch. Still, at least Chelsea can look elsewhere for goals. Eden Hazard, at the heart of everything Chelsea do well, scored twice as they crushed the spirits of this Maribor side with a thumping 6-0 win. By then, Drogba was blowing hard, but there is still an aura about one of the best strikers in Chelsea’s history.

"The cover photo for Manchester United’s first match programme of the new Gaal-actico era tried to capture the mood with one simple image: a picture of Angel di Maria’s No 7 shirt hanging in the Old Trafford dressing-room alongside that of Radamel Falcao’s No 9. Two superstars who alone could end up costing in excess of £110million. On the next peg you could only just about make out Marcos Rojo’s jersey. And if you didn’t know the identity of the other new signing making his home debut yesterday, it was practically impossible to read the blurred name and number on the back of the fourth shirt. When Daley Blind was unveiled next to Falcao at a press conference last Thursday afternoon, he might as well not have been there. A couple of polite questions were put to the baby-faced Dutchman with the mop of blond hair, but the spotlight was inevitably fixed on the Colombia striker. Daley Blind battles with Queens Park Rangers' Niko Kranjcar in the midfield at Old Trafford on Sunday . Dutch midfielder Daley Blind wins the ball off Eduardo Vargas in a way that was typical of his afternoon . There was little change yesterday. Di Maria deservedly stole the show with his match-winning contribution, and the biggest ovation of the day was reserved for Falcao’s introduction in the second half. Blind, meanwhile, eased seamlessly and selflessly into his new surroundings at the other end of the pitch. Patrolling the area in front of United’s experimental defence, he sniffed out and then snuffed out any trouble he could detect on the rare occasions QPR threatened. It was if he had been there for years. This is a job he perfected at Ajax and is the reason Van Gaal paid £14million to take the son of his old captain and right-hand man Danny Blind with him to Old Trafford. Daley Blind was able to disrupt QPR whenever they came forward but also showed his passing ability . While Angel di Maria may have dominated the game offensively, behind him Daley Blind was always there . To Van Gaal, Blind is the epitome of an Ajax player: an intelligent, disciplined, and tactically astute player capable of operating in a number of different positions and following his coach’s instructions to the letter. They don’t make you Dutch Player of the Year — an award Blind accepted at the start of this month — for any old reason. ‘I have worked with Daley in the Netherlands national squad, so he is no stranger to me,’ wrote Van Gaal in his programme notes yesterday. ‘He is a very intelligent player and a great reader of the game. He has the versatility to play in many positions which is a great asset to have and gives me many options for him.’ Van Gaal played Blind primarily as a left-back for Holland at the World Cup, and it was the 24-year-old’s arrowing through ball that picked out Robin van Persie for his spectacular diving header against Spain. He also weighed in with a goal in the third-place play-off against hosts Brazil. Going forward there will be tougher tests for Daley Blind and his teammates, but it was a good start . Manchester United's new holding midfielder makes yet another tackle to win the ball from Mauricio Isla . But Blind prefers the midfield holding role and that is where the manager hopes to utilise him most at United — a defensive anchor to the fearsome offensive line-up he has assembled at Old Trafford. That is not to say that Blind will not have licence to get forward. It was his 25-yard effort yesterday that led to the parry from Rob Green and loose ball that Falcao could — and perhaps should — have turned into his first goal for United. But not every game will be a comfortable four-goal canter against weak opposition, and Blind knows that his job going forward will be to screen his defence, break up play and get the ball rolling for United’s high-octane attack. He is a lot more than ‘a water carrier’, as Eric Cantona once dismissively described Didier Deschamps. Observers in Holland talk about his almost metronomic passing and an ability to set the tempo of a game. It was hard to remember him misplacing a pass yesterday. It was not just a defensive display, Daley Blind's shot forcing Rob Green to spill the ball to Radamel Falcao . Radamel Falcao was given all of the attention before the game, but he couldn't take his chance when it came . Afterwards Blind could not have been more satisfied with his debut. ‘I was really excited before the game,’ he said. ‘It was a really good debut and everything has gone well. I felt at home straight away. ‘It is a new team and it can be difficult at first but I think we did well. Everybody is feeling good and everyone helped each other when we lost the ball. ‘It’s important that we do that as quickly as possible when we lose it — that is the manager’s philosophy. We did a good job as a team and this is a new beginning.’ When United fans wake up this morning, Di Maria will be the name on the lips. The prospect of him teaming up with Falcao is mouthwatering indeed. But in his own way, Blind could prove to be an equally important addition to the new order at Old Trafford.","Dutch midfielder given little attention but puts in superb display .

"Roy Hodgson will hold talks with Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers after Raheem Sterling complained of fatigue ahead of England’s win in Estonia. The 19-year-old first admitted leg weariness to coach Gary Neville last Saturday during England’s final training session ahead of the Euro 2016 qualifier. Sterling then relayed the information to Hodgson who, together with members of his backroom team, took the decision to put him on the bench despite the forward being anxious to be in the starting line-up.

Wayne Rooney 758 mins . Fabian Delph 741 mins . Adam Lallana 538 mins . Sterling views criticism of him for complaining of tiredness as unfair. Hodgson, who admired Sterling’s honesty, said: ‘I should speak to Brendan, but it really is very simple and I am sure he understands the situation. Raheem has played a lot of games recently and it is the first year in the Champions League for Liverpool for a while, so the games have been quite high pressure. ‘He looked a bit tired when he came up and I will just tell him that — that he was feeling a bit tired and I made the decision to play (Adam) Lallana, but he recovered well enough. ‘He is 100 per cent fully fit and really it was just a decision on my part. Brendan has been talking about the pressures Raheem has been under and the fatigue that may have set in a little bit, so I am pretty sure he will be dealing over the next month with Raheem as he sees fit.’ Hodgson made another attempt to move away from the idea that the players are run into the ground when away with England.

Hodgson said: ‘Raheem might say it is something that is becoming ingrained in him and that he felt the need to talk about being tired more than he would normally do. ‘I don’t think there is a lot of medical evidence to support the two-day recovery. ‘I would expect players not to take it for granted that there will be two-day recoveries. On the other hand, it could easily be like this time when we did virtually nothing in terms of what I consider to be training the day after the (first) game and we did 40 minutes including warm up the day before the (second) game and that was at a fairly low level intensity.’ Rodgers criticised England’s training methods in September after Daniel Sturridge ruptured his thigh muscle .","The England boss has revealed he plans to speak to Brendan Rodgers .

Alan Pardew will be hoping for some respite from his problems when Newcastle face Leicester. And the omens look good: Newcastle are undefeated in their last eight league games against Leicester, winning four and drawing four. 10 reasons we're delighted the Premier League is back... There are further expansion plans at Sports Direct. Revenue has grown from 1.367billion in 2009 to £2.7bn in April 2014, as they gain a foothold in Europe. They boast more than 665 stores. Ashley employs around 28,000 people, but the focus will be on one member of staff when Newcastle United face Leicester City at St James’ Park. Newcastle’s owner has told friends that defeat by Nigel Pearson’s team, sitting 12th in the Barclays Premier League, is unthinkable. It could even spell the end for Alan Pardew. Ashley has a solid relationship with Newcastle’s manager, but the following three fixtures against Tottenham (league), Manchester City (Capital One Cup) and Liverpool (league) represent a formidable challenge. On Saturday, when the Premier League resumes after the international window, Ashley will fly up to Tyneside in his helicopter in time to greet Leicester’s guests. Ashley is amiable and affable, erring on the side of caution when he discusses the game before kick-off and always wishing visiting directors good luck. Defeat at home to Leicester City on Saturday could spell the end for manager Alan Pardew at St James' Park . In the Newcastle boardroom, which is finished in black and white lacquered trims, Leicester’s directors will be greeted by the sight of the shirts of all 20 Premier League clubs hanging in huge picture frames. With Ashley’s team failing to win at home since May 3, there is a danger the colours of Huddersfield, Brighton and Rotherham will replace them in the boardroom suite next season. Keeping this team in the top flight is Pardew’s job for the time being, but he is battling to keep it after failing to win any of Newcastle’s opening seven games. Newcastle - yet to win a Premier League game this season - lost 1-0 to Stoke thanks to a Peter Crouch header . The two-week international break gave him respite, as did the 2-2 draw at Swansea on October 4, but Pardew was urged to use the time wisely and re-align the team before the visit of Leicester. Ashley rarely visits the training ground, although it is not unheard of for his helicopter to touch down in the grounds of Darsley Park for an impromptu review of the club. He turned up in March unannounced, just after Newcastle had been trounced 3-0 by Everton at St James’ Park, but his presence had little impact; they lost their following game 4-0 at Southampton and by the same margin at Manchester United. Pardew has failed to arrest the decline, despite a number of arrivals at the club over the summer. They are yet to gel. There is also the mystery of why three high-profile signings - Sylvain Marveaux from Rennes, Hatem Ben Arfa from Marseille and Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa from Montpellier, have made no impact. All of them are out on loan. Understandably, in recent weeks Pardew has become increasingly introspective. Hatem Ben Arfa and Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa - on loan at Hull and Roma respectively - were both high-profile buys . Aug 17 - Man City (H) 0-2 . Aug 23 - Aston Villa (A) 0-0 .

Outside of his core coaching staff, including former Crystal Palace team-mate Andy Woodman and assistant manager John Carver, he no longer knows who to trust. Ashley has been supportive, speaking to his manager several times as they attempt to halt a catastrophic run of results. He has been reluctant to panic and fire the manager, particularly when there is a £5m compensation clause in the eight-year contract Pardew signed in September 2012. In terms of day-to-day operations at the club, Ashley misses the influence of former managing director Derek Llambias.

Despite Ashley’s southern roots (he was born and raised in the Buckinghamshire town of Burnham), he developed an affection with the North East after he bought the club in May 2007. Contrary to popular belief he admires the locals’ work ethic and is upset Newcastle supporters have mounted demonstrations against his leadership at various times over the years. Ashley, who grew up in a modest house, has paid off the club’s significant debts that were inherited from the previous regime. Today he is owed £130m by Newcastle. That can wait, but it will take more than a tank of diesel to put things right at St James’ Park. Right now, Newcastle are running on empty.

"After every England game at Wembley, when Roy Hodgson's post-match duties are almost done, a separate huddle forms around the country's head coach. In these precious moments the soundbites that immediately follow a 5-0 victory over San Marino are designed to give way to some reasoned and considered thoughts in the wider context of the national team's development. Hodgson speaks passionately about a group of players who are young, ambitious and upwardly mobile. Many of those travelling to Estonia for Sunday's Euro 2016 qualifier in Tallinn have been sourced from The Arsenal, as Hodgson still respectfully refers to the north Londoners. Danny Welbeck, one of five Arsenal players in the England squad, celebrates scoring against San Marino . Calum Chambers (left) and Kieran Gibbs (right) both started for the Three Lions against San Marino . Roy Hodgson is pleased to see a group of Arsenal players forcing their way into his plans for Euro 2016 . Five representatives — Calum Chambers, Kieran Gibbs, Jack Wilshere, Danny Welbeck and substitute Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain — were on the field at the start of the second half against San Marino. In a few weeks' time, when England prepare for a Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia and a feisty friendly with Scotland, that figure could reach six if Theo Walcott is back from injury. 'It was not long ago that we had five Liverpool players, but it's nice to see people like Oxlade-Chamberlain and Jack Wilshere really starting to reach the potential that I know Arsene Wenger always believed they had,' revealed Hodgson. Historically, the dressings room of international teams are packed with players from their country's top clubs. Midfielders Jack Wilshere (left) and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (right) will both be hoping to start against Estonia . Take Germany's success at the World Cup in Brazil last summer. Bayern Munich boasted six players —Manuel Neuer, Philipp Lahm, Jerome Boateng, Toni Kroos, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Thomas Muller — in the starting line-up against Argentina. Mario Gotze, another player from Bayern Munich, came off the substitutes' bench to score Germany's winner in extra-time. Two years previously, when Spain won Euro 2012 with victory over Italy in the final, Vicente del Bosque started with five players from Barcelona and four from Real Madrid. Oxlade-Chamberlain, who created two of England's second-half goals after coming on at the interval, believes the familiarity with his Arsenal team-mates benefits the national team. He said: 'When you play week-in-week-out and then bring that to international football, it does really help in gelling the team together. 'The Germans and the Spanish have been able to do that. When you go and watch Spain play it's almost like watching Barcelona or Real Madrid play at the times, with the number of players on the pitch. Germany started with six Bayern Munich players as they won the World Cup final against Argentina . Spain's starting XI in the Euro 2012 final was made up of nine players from  Real Madrid and Barcelona . 'It is a nice thing to have that with Arsenal at the moment. Liverpool have got a good number of players as well. It's not just those two clubs, everyone who comes away gels well — hopefully it will help us be successful. You know their characteristics and where they're going to pass and where they like the ball to be passed. 'When I got that ball down the line I knew Calum (Chambers) was going to be able to find me first and foremost and I knew that Danny likes to make that run to the front post.' Estonia vs England probable teams . Of course, let's remember that the opposition so far this season have comprised Switzerland (beaten by Slovenia on Thursday) and San Marino (beaten by everybody). Hodgson has focused on youth for this campaign, turning to the emerging talent in the country as England head towards the finals in France in June 2016. At St George's Park on Tuesday, when Hodgson was a man short for the session he wanted to put on, he sent for Chelsea midfielder Lewis Baker from Gareth Southgate's Under 21s. It gave Baker a glimpse of the future, showing the youngster what is in front of him if he continues to develop as a player with England's junior teams. Blooding these players could yet be Hodgson's legacy. 'Realistically this team is mostly 21 or 22. People will tell me they don't reach their best until they are 27 or 28 so perhaps not. 'A, I want to win matches and B, plan for the future. I am picking people I think can do the job. A good example of that is Chambers. Here is a guy who played a few times for the Under 20s, jumped straight over the Under 21s and went into the first team. 'That is a great pat on the back for our development system. I know not everyone agrees with this, but the pragmatic reason you have development teams is to get into the first team. You are an Under 21 player because you want to be a senior player. We didn't know how Sterling would turn out a year ago to the player he is today. Chelsea midfielder Lewis Baker (centre), pictured in training with England's Under 21 squad, was given the chance to train with the senior squad by Hodgson . Hodgson has been impressed with Chambers' rapid progression to his senior squad . 'We did not know the early days of Jordan Henderson at Liverpool that he would become the player he is. We didn't know Ross Barkley would kick on. 'I have been lucky enough to be there when it happened and I suppose, bright enough to realise that I don't have to hang my hat on 30-year-olds. If these guys are that good, I can put them in the team.' As ever, the acid test for this team will be tournament football.","Danny Welbeck, Kieran Gibbs, Calum Chambers and Jack Wilshere all started in the 5-0 win against San Marino .

"Roy Hodgson admits he will have to manage the expectation around Raheem Sterling as the England forward comes to terms with his growing status. The head coach revealed that Liverpool's Sterling was devastated to be replaced at half-time during the 5-0 victory over San Marino on Thursday. But Hodgson believes there will come a time when Sterling needs a longer break. He said: 'We are conscious of managing (the expectation). I don't think it will need managing until he shows signs of suffering from it. He is not alone in that. But when Raheem shows signs of not being quite as sharp, not doing as well, trying too hard, that might be the moment we think we have to manage this and give him a break.

"The biggest test in international football is to play in front of 90,000 spectators in a World Cup semi-final against Germany or Argentina. In the absence of anything like that coming any time soon for England’s players, an entirely different proposition is a a Euro 2016 qualifier against the world’s worst international football team. Against opposition as pitiful as San Marino, it is about professionalism . England striker Wayne Rooney is brought down for a penalty by San Marino's Andy Selva . Wayne Rooney scores from the spot to put England 2-0 ahead against San Marino . For three days, since England’s players met at St George’s Park on Monday evening, they have been psyching themselves up to play a team that could barely string two passes together. Wembley is no place for San Marino. This was a night to get the job done, to show focus before England travel to Tallinn on Sunday for a slightly trickier clash in Group E against Estonia. In many ways England’s players, who toyed with their opponents throughout, should be congratulated for taking a game like this as seriously as they did. Here, in front of just over 50,000 die-hard England fans at the national stadium, they simply wore down their opponents until they surrendered. It took only 23 minutes. In years to come, it is to be hoped that the FA follow through with their proposal to take matches like this around the country again.When Phil Jagielka scored England’s opening goal, there was a polite ripple of applause from the fans in the stands. It was like being at the tennis. England's Danny Welbeck scores the third goal against San Marino at Wembley on Thursday . Raheem Sterling continued his international education against sub-standard opposition . San Marino were painful to watch. They boast a right back in Mirko Palazzi who, unfathomably, just threw the ball over Joe Hart’s goal-line from a throw-in. What a night it was for the Vitaiolis, too: at half time neither Fabio nor Matteo had managed to get into double figures in terms of touches. They got there in the end, just after the start of the second half. In the dug-out Hodgson broke into sporadic fits of laughter as he waited, patiently, for England to score again. He will learn nothing about the ability of his players on the ball when England are playing opposition that would struggle to beat the best eleven pub players from your village. Instead it is part of a learning process for these players, accepting that internationals can throw up some ridiculous matches. San Marino pair Vitaioli Fabio and Palazzi Mirko were on damage limitation exercise . So the likes of Calum Chambers, Raheem Sterling, Kieran Gibbs and others can continue their international education against sub-standard opposition. San Marino fit the bill. There was not a hint of arrogance about them, from the moment England sang the national anthem with their now traditional gusto to the embraces at the final whistle. These are cheap caps against scarcely credible opposition, but the younger gang in the England squad are learning what it means to play at Wembley Stadium for the national team. They know that the minimum acceptable number of goals against the 208th-best team in the world is four or five on home soil . It creates a different environment and that can only be a good thing for a team that must grow together before they set foot in France for the finals in 2016. Other than that, what is the head coach supposed to glean from a game like this? Manager Roy Hodgson could afford a smile as England enjoyed a comfortable victory . For some reason he gave a little fist pump when Wayne Rooney scored his 42nd goal in an England shirt from the penalty spot just before half time. Captain and coach have a flourishing relationship. He will be pleased with the contribution of others, especially James Milner after he was stationed in a deep-lying central midfield position in the first half. It was a decent performance from the Manchester City midfielder, but no-one involved with the national team will get carried away after this. Good on Danny Welbeck for adding England’s third after the break, but there are far bigger tests to come for Hodgson’s squad. Scotland, Italy and the Republic of Ireland all feature in the international calendar before the end of the season. Let’s be honest, those games cannot come quickly enough.","England have been psyching themselves up in team meetings and training sessions to play a team that could barely string two passes together .

"Read Matt Barlow's report from Tallinn . To pull on the England shirt, to wear those Three Lions on the left breast, is the biggest honour in the game. Estonia away or Brazil at home: every cap for your country counts. So what, if anything, fried Raheem Sterling’s brain after he played just 45 minutes of England’s thumping 5-0 victory over San Marino at Wembley on Thursday evening?

Wayne Rooney 758 mins . Fabian Delph 741 mins . Adam Lallana 538 mins . We must remember Sterling is 19. To kill this kid for pulling out of an international match is dangerous territory. Far better to look into the real reasons why a player Roy Hodgson regards as the brightest talent in English football has opted out of a Euro 2016 qualifier in Tallinn. If Sterling really approached Hodgson at London Colney on Saturday morning to ask not to play, then there is a deeper, wider psychological issue in our game. It would be remiss of club and country if they don't provide whatever emotional support he needs. ‘Raheem Sterling is a teenager,’ tweeted Gary Lineker. ‘Teenagers do get tired and even moody. He's young, still developing, we should cut him some slack.’ Lineker is right, but England must immediately start searching for the reasons why a player would pull out of the starting line-up more than 24 hours before kick-off. Take Neymar, for example. At the same age as Sterling is now, the Brazil forward had commercial contracts with 11 different companies from TVs to sportswear to banks (to look after all that money). Sterling was finally introduced after 64 minutes, coming on for his Liverpool club mate Jordan Henderson . The Brazilian was set up to handle it all. So why can’t Sterling, if Hodgson’s analysis is to be taken at face value, hack it? Every player is different and Hodgson’s version is that Sterling, who has scored three times in the Barclays Premier League for Liverpool, was not mentally ready to face Estonia. ‘He told me so,’ revealed the England manager. So if the relationship really is that strong, why didn’t Hodgson offers some words of encouragement when he sent for Sterling to save this game after 64 minutes. England’s head coach turned to his assistant Ray Lewington to call ‘Raheem, Raheem’ back from the corner flag when he was warming up in an orange bib midway through the second half. Then he left it to Gary Neville to have a few words with the Liverpool forward when Sterling swapped his red base layer for the red No 19 shirt of England. The 19-year-old immediately got on the ball and tried to make things happen for England . Sterling came on and made an impression, but the expectation of the youngster is high . As he waited in the technical area for the ball to go out of play, England’s goalkeeper coach Dave Watson was sent out with a tactics folder to show Sterling the positions he should take up at set-pieces. There was barely any advice, or a word exchanged, with Hodgson. How odd. Inevitably then it was the Liverpool forward, the man too tired to train at London Colney on Saturday morning, who won the free-kick for England on the edge of the Estonia penalty area. He replaced Jordan Henderson, racing around the pitch like a puppy chasing falling leaves. He looked anything but tired or fatigued, mentally or physically. Sterling raises expectations when he is on the ball, perking up England’s supporters with those step overs, the double-tap touch he relies on to beat his opponents and then pacey, twisting runs. Sterling raises expectations when he gets the ball and perks up the support, despite starting on the bench . Eventually one of them, when it first appeared that he was about to take on one man too many, that he won the 73rd minute free-kick. Wayne Rooney scored and England maintained their 100 per cent record in Group E after victories against Estonia, Switzerland and San Marino in this Euro 2016 qualification campaign. So what of the intriguing sub-plot, the story that emerged after England’s head coach clumsily revealed in a television interview before the game that Sterling told him he was too tired to finish a training session? At 19, this is highly unusual behaviour. On Sunday he was made to wait his turn, sitting on the bench alongside England’s substitute keepers Ben Foster and Fraser Forster until Hodgson twitched. Sterling is brought down on the edge of the box by Martin Vunk (right) - and Wayne Rooney scored the free-kick . Joal Lindpere (left) attempts to catch up with Sterling in the second-half in Tallinn . Sat there in his tracksuit bottoms, just below pitch level alongside the assorted coaching staff, medics and substitutes, Sterling looked remote and removed. Think back to Hodgson’s verdict on the Liverpool forward in a corridor at Wembley on Thursday in the minutes that followed the 5-0 thumping of San Marino. It was there that Hodgson admitted there would come a time when he would have to manage expectations around Sterling. That moment has arrived sooner than England’s head coach expected. Sterling had been on the field for nine minutes, looking like a puppy chasing falling leaves as he hoovered up the ground in search of England’s winner. Sterling, who was like a 'puppy chasing fallen leaves' when he come on, motors past two Estonians . He made the difference when he came on, lulling Estonia’s defence into the foul on the edge of the penalty area that led to Rooney scoring direct from the resulting free-kick. He made the difference, but these are delicate times for Sterling and it will be down to Brendan Rodgers to realign him in the coming days. This is about a kid, a young player at the highest level of the game, crying out for help. Club and country should make sure he gets it.","Raheem Sterling said he wanted to be left out of England's starting XI .

"Roy Hodgson's row with Brendan Rodgers escalated when England’s head coach claimed Daniel Sturridge wanted to train on the day he picked up his thigh injury. Sturridge, who has been left out of England’s squad for the Euro 2016 qualifiers against San Marino and Estonia, has not played since picking up the injury after England’s 1-0 win over Norway. Rodgers claims the Liverpool forward is instructed not to train for 48 hours after a match, but Hodgson offered a very different version of events on Thursday. Daniel Sturridge is still sidelined after getting injured on international duty . Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge is battling to overcome a thigh problem . England’s head coach said: ‘The interesting thing for the session where Daniel got injured is that he was quite keen to take part in that training session because he was such an important part of it and we were trying to develop a new system of play. ‘He was the forward who understood it best. He was more than happy to come in and help us to get our points over to the others. ‘It’s doubly unfortunate that he got injured. But injuries do happen. No manager has as yet said to me that players must not train two days after a game. ‘But I understand that Daniel is an important player and I understand Brendan being unhappy that he is injured. Roy Hodgson has escalated his war of words with Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers . ‘You have to be careful saying injuries are preventable. We could have done a completely different training session or Daniel could have done a recovery session which Brendan might have thought was more suitable but I still couldn’t guarantee there wouldn’t have been an injury.’ Hodgson insists he will not be dictated to by club managers over which players he can select for international duty, but Rodgers appears to have outmanoeuvred the England boss. Sturridge has yet to train with the first team at Liverpool as he recovers, but there is a chance he will be a substitute in Saturday’s game against West Bromwich Albion. If Sturridge is included for the first time since the 3-0 victory at Tottenham on August 31, it will come as a severe embarrassment to Hodgson. Brendan Rodgers is trying to get Daniel Sturridge up to speed after four weeks out . Rodgers said: ‘I respect Roy has work to do but my thoughts are for the Liverpool players and what their needs are. ‘We agreed it was too soon for Daniel to meet up irrespective of whether he is involved or not. He has not trained with the team at all so it was not the right time for him to go. ‘It was amicable, there is no issue. We will have to wait and see how he is. He can’t be ready to play for England if he is not ready to play for Liverpool. Liverpool is our priority. ‘He has had a Grade One injury now for near on four weeks which is a long time and my focus is now getting him to play for Liverpool. Daniel Sturridge hasn't played since England's friendly win against Norway last month . ‘Once he is playing for Liverpool and showing that level of fitness, Roy will then look at him and get him into the squad.’ Hodgson also revealed on Thursday that Sturridge has now taken on the role as an unofficial team leader with England. ‘The one person who is unhappy is Daniel because he would have loved to have been with us,’ he added .

"There will be a time when Vincent Kompany looks back on his career at Manchester City and reflects on some towering performances. At the Etihad on Sunday, with the formidable presence of Chelsea striker Diego Costa keeping him on his toes in a bruising and compelling clash, this will rank among them. Kompany lives for days like this, captaining his team into battle and emerging with the upper hand against one of the most prolific forwards in world football. Vincent Kompany put in another towering performance for Manchester City against Chelsea on Sunday . The Belgian captain and Diego Costa were involved in a titanic battle... which Kompany got the better of . Costa was kept quiet by Kompany, stopping him scoring his eighth Premier League goal . Costa had scored seven in his opening four games in the Barclays Premier League since his move from Atletico Madrid. It was Kompany’s job to stop him scoring the eighth. The only thing missing was a win but, in the circumstances — down to 10 men after the dismissal of Pablo Zabaleta — one point will suffice. If Kompany had been on the winning team, no one would have begrudged him. This was a colossal performance, restricting the leading scorer in the Barclays Premier League to just two shots. One hit the post, when Chelsea were leading 1-0, but that was the biggest scare. Kompany’s timing was exceptional. He was immaculate, hooking the ball off Willian, Eden Hazard or Costa and then striding forward into areas usually occupied by Yaya Toure or Fernandinho. Eliaquim Mangala was also impressive for City on his debut in England . Kompany gets the better of Ramires during the crucial game between the champions and the favourites . Between Kompany and Mangala, making his debut for City, they roughed up Costa, trying to provoke the striker. Someone, someday will make him blow a gasket. City’s captain was ready for him in a clash that had threatened to boil over from the moment Fernandinho was shown the first yellow card. That was 11 minutes in, with Fernandinho cautioned by Mike Dean for a reckless challenge that set the tone. In all, seven players were booked, including Costa. Chelsea’s forward was subdued, well short of the threat he provided in the opening four games against Burnley, Leicester, Everton and Swansea. Here at the Etihad he came up against two who have marked some of the best forwards in the world. No disrespect to the central defensive partnerships of Jason Shackell and Michael Duff (Burnley), Wes Morgan and Liam Moore (Leicester), Phil Jagielka and Sylvain Distin (Everton) plus Ashley Williams and Jordi Amat (Swansea), but this was a tougher test and he struggled to impose himself after his manager, Jose Mourinho, revealed in the week that the striker is struggling with a hamstring injury. Costa was in sublime form before Sunday, netting seven goals against weak defences . John Terry and Kompany shake hands after the game, both were in imperious form . Kompany shares a moment with Belgian team-mate Eden Hazard at the Etihad Stadium . A couple of years ago, when Kompany was in his pomp, he turned in what is rightly regarded as the finest performance he has ever given in a City shirt. Against the champions, Kompany kept Manchester United’s forward line quiet at one end and scored with a header at the other to set up a 1-0 win. Two games later City were crowned champions. That is the target for this team, for Kompany to guide them through this tricky period and make a fist of it at the top of the table. They haven’t won since August 25, when the champions blew Liverpool away at the Etihad and all was well with the world. That seems a long time ago for City, but at least Kompany can still prove a point. Kompany is approaching his form from 2012, when he lead City to their first Premier League title .","Kompany kept Costa from scoring his eight Premier League goal on Sunday .

"England manager Roy Hodgson has agreed not to pick Daniel Sturridge for the upcoming Euro 2016 qualifiers — and so avoided a club v country row. Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers said after Wednesday night’s defeat in Basle: ‘I’ve spoken to Roy today and he accepts that he (Sturridge) is not fit and he has to use the next two weeks to get fit for his club — which is the priority.’ Daniel Sturridge was injured in training for England earlier this month resulting in him missing the opening European Championship qualifier against Switzerland . Liverpool were bracing themselves for Sturridge to be selected on Thursday in the squad to face San Marino and Estonia, despite Rodgers warning that the 25-year-old will not be fit. England’s medical staff spent time at Liverpool’s Melwood training ground with the club’s doctors on Monday assessing Sturridge’s injury ahead of the announcement. The 25-year-old striker, who is recovering from a thigh problem and missed Wednesday night’s defeat, has been a huge success since joining Liverpool 18 months ago and is on the verge of signing a new £150,000-a-week deal. He still has four years left on the terms agreed after his £12million arrival from Chelsea. But Liverpool are ready to reward his progress — he has scored 36 goals in 52 games — with a new deal, heavily incentivised on his performances and run to the summer of 2019. Sturridge celebrates scoring against Southampton in Liverpool's Premier League opener . As for Hodgson, he names his squad on Thursday to take on San Marino (next Thursday), Estonia (October 12) and Slovenia (November 15). Manchester United left back Luke Shaw is set to drop down into the Under 21s, with Kieran Gibbs in line for a recall to the seniors. Calum Chambers may be retained by Hodgson as cover for John Stones, Phil Jagielka and Gary Cahill. On Wednesday, former England defender Rio Ferdinand, releasing his autobiography #2sides this week, claimed England have problems starting at junior level. Liverpool players look dejected after going 1-0 down during the defeat to Basle, which Sturridge missed . Daniel Sturridge is eyeing up a new deal at Anfield to keep him at the club until the summer of 2019 . Ferdinand said on Facebook: ‘The problems in our game that need to be addressed go much deeper. We have to be thinking about Under 14s and 15s as the Germans and other top countries do. There are cycles in football and we need to create our own. 'Look at the Dutch. Going into the tournament (World Cup), they were the least fancied of the bigger nations but ended up a shootout away from the final. They’ve been clever and clear about their football for decades.

"In the end it was a cry for help. The great pity is that nobody within the England camp detected a problem until Raheem Sterling summoned the courage to speak to the head coach on Saturday morning. 'Boss, can I have a word?' was the first time Roy Hodgson became aware of an issue with the forward's condition, mental or physical, ahead of a Euro 2016 qualifier in Estonia the following day. After the game, which England won 1-0, Hodgson spoke candidly about the exchange he had with Sterling at the team's London Colney training base. Raheem Sterling (second from left) watches England take on Estonia from the bench in Tallinn . The Liverpool star had complained of leg weariness to manager Roy Hodgson the day before the game . Sterling came on in the second half and won the free-kick which led to Wayne Rooney's winning goal . Hodgson's decisiveness, moving Adam Lallana to the tip of the diamond, caught Sterling by surprise. He was asked to wear a bib: substitute. Lallana's promotion can be traced to the players' bar at Wembley last Thursday, when Hodgson was raving about his second-half performance in the 5-0 thumping of San Marino. To those present it was clear that Hodgson wanted to re-align the team to accommodate him for the trip to Tallinn. Lallana slows the game down, a Teddy Sheringham-type figure behind the main forward line, a player who lets his brain and his boots do the talking. Hodgson wanted Sterling and Lallana in the team, but with precious little preparation time before the team travelled to Estonia, he couldn't find a solution. Fabian Delph was earmarked to play ahead of James Milner. Jack Wilshere has been put on such a pedestal by Hodgson that he appears undroppable. Jordan Henderson, who is one of Sterling's close friends, is a fixture in the team because of his ceaseless running. Sterling, then, unexpectedly provided England's head coach with an opportunity to shuffle the pack. So, how did an organisation that prides itself on sourcing specialists from every conceivable field fail to notice Sterling's introspection? 'You should always try to look for that,' conceded Hodgson. 'Our record over the last two-and-a-half years has not been too bad in terms of looking after players. 'We have very good medical and fitness staff and we do try to consider these things.' Could they have done better, or has Sterling really burnt out already? Coaches, medical staff, sports scientists, the unit leaders Hodgson has appointed within his squad, could have seen the warning signs. Saliva tests, a morning routine for the top teams, are supposed to flag up fatigue or duress. Even England's much-trumpeted psychiatrist Dr Steve Peters, who was with the national team for San Marino (but didn't travel to Estonia), failed to realise something was troubling the forward. Adam Lallana, Sterling's Liverpool team-mate, was picked in his place after impressing against San Marino . Sterling uses his pace to burst away from Estonia's Joal Lindpere at the A. Le Coq Arena on Sunday evening . Psychiatrist Dr Steve Peters (left) failed to spot that there was something troubling Sterling . Sterling is only 19 and he needs time to adjust to his unexpected, rapid elevation in the game. You cannot turn on a television, listen to the radio, or attend a Liverpool or England press conference without being told that he is the 'best teenager in football'. To be spoken of in these terms takes some adjustment. Wayne Rooney, becoming a pastoral presence now that he is captain, has spoken to Sterling about these pressures. Stories abound about Sterling's future, with claims that Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain hope to sign him from Liverpool. The issues over his £30,0000-a-week contract, reported by Sportsmail 10 days ago, add to the focus on a player who tells friends that he is never happier than when he is out on a pitch with a ball. In the early hours of Monday, when he stepped off the plane that took the team back to Manchester, his Twitter account was full of vile comments from outraged England fans. Before he took himself off to bed he re-tweeted a couple of them and added, endearingly, 'I'm only human'. Sterling is reportedly wanted by the likes of European giants Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain . The 19-year-old has become one of Hodgson's most important players in a short space of time . He is a talented boy, but he is operating under different demands now that he has been bracketed among the best teenagers in the world. Suddenly he must win every game for club and country. It isn't fair, but the wider issue is the inability of the England set-up to notice a potential problem with their star turn. For the avoidance of any doubt, here is Hodgson's response on Thursday to a question about the England set-up managing the expectations around Sterling. 'We are conscious of managing it,' he said. 'I don't think it will need managing until he shows signs of suffering from it. When Raheem shows signs of not being quite as sharp, not doing as well, trying too hard, that might be the moment we think we have to manage this and give him a break. 'But that is not the case at the moment and I don't think Liverpool need to worry. His first half against San Marino was as lively as it could have been. Sterling, pictured celebrating a goal against Tottenham, began the season in fine form for Liverpool . The former QPR youngster was taken off at half-time during England's 5-0 win against San Marino . 'At half time I said, 'I am taking you two (Sterling and Henderson) off', and they looked at me like, 'Don't do that — we want to stay on' and that is quite nice.' It is possible all the publicity caused Sterling to panic. Judging by his performance in Estonia, where he came on with the game still goalless, the rest has done him good. He looked revitalised, without a hint of fatigue in his performance, as he went on to win the 74th-minute free-kick on the edge of the area that was despatched beyond Sergei Pareiko by Rooney. Sterling's is highly unusual behaviour, particularly in a sport that traditionally counts on characters, especially in England, to battle through. Perhaps this incident is confirmation that those gutsy performances we demanded from anyone playing in an England shirt are a thing of the past. If that is the case, the sport must adapt to these needs. VIDEO Sterling defends England tiredness .","Roy Hodgson started Raheem Sterling on the bench against Estonia .

"Wayne Rooney claims England’s players are 100 per cent behind Roy Hodgson, as the manager prepares to hand Fabian Delph a shock start in Monday night’s Euro 2016 qualifier against Switzerland. Hodgson has lost the support of the country following the disastrous World Cup campaign and is under pressure to secure a result against an emerging Swiss side at St Jakob-Park. The England boss is set to give Delph his full debut in a 4-3-3 formation. The Aston Villa midfielder has played just 21 minutes of senior international football, after replacing Jack Wilshere against Norway at Wembley last Wednesday.

Doubt: Jordan Henderson could miss the Three Lions' Euro 2016 qualifier in Switzerland on Monday night . Jordan Henderson, Jack Wilshere and Delph are expected to be the three in England’s midfield as Hodgson attempts to add some more muscle in that area, while Danny Welbeck is in for injured Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge. Henderson was taken off in training on Sunday night with an injury to his right leg, but Hodgson is hopeful the Liverpool man will be fit. James Milner would be the likely replacement if Henderson fails to recover. Captain Rooney said: ‘Us as a team, not just myself, we back Roy 100 per cent. ‘We made that clear after we went out of the World Cup — he brings ideas to us. ‘We know that the World Cup was a disappointment, but I still feel we can move forward as a team . 'We're progressing all the time. I think that will show in the next two years. The lads are working hard to get the best out of the ideas Roy is showing us.'

England's head coach claimed he wanted respect from his players when he spoke ahead of their final training session before this Euro 2016 qualifier. Hodgson added: 'Popularity doesn't really mean much to me. I've never been interested with being popular with players. Am I seeing the nasty side of the job? No. There is no nasty side. 'I love this job. It's a magnificent job. It's the pinnacle of any coaching career.

Hodgson claims he was surprised by the reaction after he claimed a statistic that England only had two shots on target against Norway was 'absolute f****** bollocks'. They also had six shots blocked. He added: 'First of all, I'm not a calm person, never have been a calm person. Secondly, as any player who has worked with me would attest, there are always moments of extreme anger and viciousness in my coaching session.

I'd rather be accused of being a bit over robust in response to questions I didn't agree with. 'But is Roy Hodgson an angry person, has he got a nasty streak? You wouldn't have to go too far to prove it. The players would come out of the woodwork in no time. I've never sought popularity. I like to consider myself a good professional, a good coach and someone who believes in his players. 'It's unusual for me to get angry with my players because I protect them.

"Daniel Sturridge is close to signing a new long-term deal that could net the Liverpool striker £150,000 per week. Sturridge, 25, who is recovering from a thigh problem and missed Wednesday night’s defeat in Basle, has been a huge success since joining 18 months ago. He still has four years left on the terms that were agreed after his £12million arrival from Chelsea. Daniel Sturridge is eyeing up a new deal at Anfield to keep him at the club until the summer of 2019 . Sturridge celebrates scoring against Southampton in Liverpool's Premier League opener . But Liverpool are ready to reward his progress — he has scored 36 goals in 52 games — with a new contract, which would be heavily incentivised on his performances and run to the summer of 2019. Talks had been planned for the end of last season but were put on hold due to the World Cup. England manager Roy Hodgson has agreed not to pick Sturridge for the upcoming Euro 2016 qualifiers — and so avoided a club v country row. Sturridge was injured in training for England earlier this month resulting in him missing the opening European Championship qualifier against Switzerland . Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers said after Wednesday night's defeat in Basle: ‘I’ve spoken to Roy today and he accepts that he (Sturridge) is not fit and he has to use the next two weeks to get fit for his club — which is the priority.’ Liverpool were bracing themselves for Sturridge to be selected on Thursday in the squad to face San Marino and Estonia, despite Rodgers warning that the 25-year-old will not be fit. England’s medical staff spent time at Liverpool’s Melwood training ground with the club’s doctors on Monday assessing Sturridge’s injury ahead of the announcement.

"When Brendan Rodgers had finished, it became clear that he had splattered a few egos across the four walls of the visitors’ dressing room at St Jakob Park. ‘Soft’ he labelled Liverpool's players after they failed to show a response to a goal scored by Basle’s evergreen striker Marco Strellar in the 52nd minute. It is impossible to disagree. Rodgers had every right to tear into them because he expected something vastly different to this when his summer spending soared beyond £100m. Where has their crisp passing game gone? What happened to the attitude that took them to within two points of winning the Barclays Premier League title? Bring it back, quick.

Subs not used: Brad Jones, Toure, Moreno, Lucas, Borini. Booked: Sterling, Gerrard, Balotelli. Referee: Jonas Eriksson (Sweden) Ratings by Neil Ashton in Switzerland . While we are here, there is also the unfortunate footnote to Liverpool’s fourth defeat and the moment when Mario Balotelli undermined the authority of his manager by refusing to acknowledge Liverpool’s travelling fans. You could hear Rodgers whistling at him amid the bedlam in the stands. ‘I don’t know if he came back out,’ added Rodgers, but it was clear that Balotelli was already showered and sitting alone on the team bus. It was unacceptable, an affront to the couple of thousand or more Liverpool supporters who made the trip to Switzerland to watch their team on a Champions League night. They deserve better. Liverpool’s players have to give it to them because the stellar names in this squad should be showing signs that they are equipped for the twin challenge of domestic and European football. As yet they are not. Dejan Lovren, Javier Manquillo, Mario Balotelli, Lazar Markovic, Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert should be loving life at a club who finished runners-up in the Premier League last season. ‘I’m not happy with the intensity,’ admitted Rodgers and there isn’t a soul who watched that performance who could possibly disagree. Jose Enrique, who returned to the team for the Capital One Cup tie against Middlesbrough last week, was dreadful. Twice he failed to read the passes of Steven Gerrard, allowing one to roll under his foot and then bizarrely kicking the ball at Ahmed Hamoudi with an attempted pass. For this team to be given the runaround by Streller - who was exceptional - Geoffrey Serey Die, Breel Embolo, Ahmed Hamoudi and the rest of the gang at Paulo Sousa’s disposal is unacceptable.

Wince, then, because Carlo Ancelotti’s rampant team - who beat Basle 5-1 and - are up next at Anfield. After that, it is on to the Bernabeu for the return. Liverpool need a crash course in winning football matches, or else this season could soon turn into catch up. They were beaten here when Streller, Basle’s hard-working captain, was first to react to Mignolet’s failure to clear Martin Skrtel’s misdirected clearance. This one couldn’t possibly be pinned on the Liverpool goalkeeper, but nevertheless Streller gobbled up the chance to put Basle into the lead. They never once looked like losing it.

Philippe Coutinho was restored to the Liverpool starting XI in midfield as Adam Lallana dropped to the bench . At times, especially in the first half, Liverpool approached this game like a one-off. Every chip they had seemed to be on red. With victory secured in their opening group game, there was no need to pile forward in search of more glory. Balotelli had started well, unaware of the criticism from Jamie Carragher - ‘I can’t help the way I feel about him’ - in the Sky Sports studio. Others will share his view now. He started well enough here, ducking and diving between the role of target man and genuine goal threat until Basle’s defence got to grips with him.

Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli challenges Basle's Geoffrey Serey Die for the ball . Lazar Markovic attempts an acrobatic effort on goal, but his shot was saved by Basle goalkeeper Tomas Vaclik . His cute little touches on the spin, angling the ball into the path of the onrushing figures of Raheem Sterling or Markovic in the opening minutes should given him the confidence to make this his night. Little Sterling was busting a gut, punished for offside when he eventually rolled the ball into the net after two minutes and later booked for a foul in the first half. His lunge on substitute Derlis Gonzalez at the start of the second half could easily have been a penalty. Liverpool gave the ball away too cheaply here, surrendering possession on the halfway line when they should have been trying to take the sting out of the game.

Mignolet made a couple of decent first half saves, first from Mohamed Elneny’s curling shot from the edge of the area and then with his feet to stop Serey Die.

"Arsenal goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez will be hoping his next appearance for the club goes rather better than his last one. The former Argentina youth international, who joined the Gunners’ academy from Independiente in 2010, is set to start in goal for Arsene Wenger’s men in their Champions League clash against Anderlecht on Wednesday. The 22-year-old will be asked to solve a huge goalkeeping headache with Wojciech Szczesny (suspended) and David Ospina (thigh injury) both unavailable for the trip to Belgium. Emiliano Martinez (right) will play in goal for Arsenal on Wednesday, as the Gunners face a goalkeeping crisis . Martinez (centre) let in five goals in his previous appearance - against Reading in the Capital One Cup . The 22-year-old Argentine trains with Arsenal star Alexis Sanchez ahead of his first Champions League start . Martinez will have mixed feelings about his last appearance in an Arsenal shirt that came almost two years ago on October 30, 2012, in a League Cup clash against Reading at the Madejski Stadium. Wenger’s side won that night, but Martinez let in five in a chaotic 7-5 victory. His only other appearance for the north London club came in the same competition four weeks earlier as he helped Arsenal to a 6-1 win over Coventry at the Emirates. Martinez’s lack of experience will be a major worry for Wenger going into Wednesday's clash, but his capacity to handle the occasion will not be quite so much of a concern. Having spotted Martinez, who made 15 appearances for Sheffield Wednesday during a loan spell last season, as a 17-year-old, Arsenal’s South American scouts made the call to London insisting the capture of the goalkeeper was must. Martinez in training at London Colney last week - he will make his Champions League debut on Wednesday . Martinez was on loan at Sheffield Wednesday last season, where he played 15 times . Martinez could cost Arsenal in the region of £1million if he meets a myriad of incentives attached to his switch from Independiente. His performances for the club’s academy sides merely underlined his reputation as a young goalkeeper with a huge future, but he found it difficult to break into the first team with Szczesny and Lukasz Fabianski, who has since joined Swansea, ahead of him in the pecking order. Fabianski’s exit in the summer raised hope of a promotion to second-choice, but the arrival of Colombia international keeper Ospina, who won plaudits at the World Cup, has provided another obstacle to Martinez. Wojciech Szczesny is suspended for the trip to Anderlecht after being sent off against Galatasaray . Back-up goalkeeper David Ospina has not travelled due to a thigh injury, giving Martinez his chance . Ryan Huddart, 17, is set also to travel to Belgium as reserve keeper, while Wenger will make a late check on the fitness of Jack Wilshere ahead of finalising his squad. Wilshere injured an ankle in the 2-2 draw against Hull on Saturday. Wenger had said he would be fit for the trip but will make a late decision on his availability. Meanwhile, out-of-favour forward Lukas Podolski saw his popularity among Arsenal fans soar yesterday after claiming ‘hell would freeze over’ before he joined arch-rivals Spurs.

"Micky Adams is set to be appointed as the new manager of Tranmere Rovers. The League Two club sacked manager Rob Edwards after just five months in charge. But the club have moved quickly to find an appointment and have held talks with Adams over the vacant job. Micky Adams is set to make a quick return to management at Tranmere Rovers after leaving Port Vale . Adams left Port Vale in September after a disappointing start to the season, but is now set for a return to the game with Tranmere.

"There is a contentious agenda at Arsenal's Annual General Meeting, which starts at 11.30am. You can follow the main talking points as they are debated, with SAMI MOKBEL in attendance at the Emirates Stadium. The AGM has had a familiar theme over the last 10 years: patience. Chief executive Ivan Gazidis was preaching that message yet again earlier this week ahead of the meeting - so Gunners fans couldn't be blamed for thinking it was Groundhog Day. Arsene Wenger's men won the FA Cup in May, ending their nine-year trophy drought, but there have been few signs this season that Arsenal are ready to mount a serious challenge for the Premier League title or the Champions League - Wenger's holy grail - despite the summer signings of Alexis Sanchez and Danny Welbeck. Gazidis is set to issuer a similar speech at Thursday's AGM, but whether the club's loyal fans and ambitious shareholders are ready to accept the endless calls to wait remains to be seen. Host commentator . SAMI MOKBEL: It's all over for another year. Phew! It was all very civilised in the end. Now it is time for questions from the floor: 'Were there funds available to strengthen the defence. If so why weren't they spent?' Keswick: 'It's not my wish to double guess what Arsene Wenger wants to do. Arsene Wenger calls the shots on football.' Wenger then declines to explain why he hasn't signed a defender since Thomas Vermaelen exit. And why does Wenger never use a 4-4-2 formation, a system which provided him with the most success in the early part of his Arsenal career? Wenger: 'It's about balance. We have many creative players through the middle. So it's difficult to find a balance between attacking and defending. In Europe it's difficult because you can't lose a midfielder. But you will certainly see it during the season, maybe when Giroud is fit.' Gazidis is then asked for his opinions on an overseas Premier League game. 'We have never asked for that,' Gazidis said. 'But the Premier League should not rest on its laurels. All avenues should be explored, but it's far too early to make a judgement on an overseas game.' Question about the diversity of the Arsenal board. It's currently all male and white. Keswick: 'We will worry about the diversity.' Gazidis is then asked about the London living wage: 'Policy on wages is to give out workers attractive rates of pay. They are all about statutory rates. The issue is subject of debate, this is a matter for government and we will abide by the decisions they make.' Gazidis is then asked about safe standing: 'We are open to safe standing, but it's a matter for the authorities.' And then why the club have big cash reserves which are not being spent on transfers. 'The topic is far more complex than has been reported. We do try to keep a reasonable amount in reserve and a reasonable amount for transfers. We don't publicly disclose the amount we do have in reserve. But it's untrue to say we are sitting on cash we don't want to use.' The cost of travelling to away games is then put to the Arsenal board... Gazidis said: 'We realise the high cost of travelling to away games. Each club have their own ticketing policies, and we are an attractive proposition for clubs. We will be providing away fans with a £10 refreshment club voucher over the Christmas period.' Question about the succession planning for Wenger's departure: . Keswick said: 'I don't comment on other clubs, good luck to them and their problems. Think that talk is premature, but we follow the situation very closely. This club will always be attractive for the best managers in the world. But we are keeping an eye on it.' And here's more from Wenger on the club's transfer policy: . 'We won the FA Cup with a difficult run, but we managed to deliver the trophy and it makes us stronger, more confident and I believe we will have a strong season. We bought good players, I believe we've done remarkably well in the transfer market. We wanted one more player, but couldn't. We will try to rectify that in January. We have a good core of young British players, who feel the value of our club. Slowly the modern game has lost that. So we need your support again. I encourage you to be behind us. You are magnificent. And I'm sure we will come out this season more united and stronger.' And now we here from Arsene Wenger, who recently celebrated his 18th year in charge of the club. ‘This is always an important part of my season, I know you are ambitious, critical and sceptical, but you are very loyal. And I'm very grateful to see the same faces because we love this club. I know I don't always please you like I love to, but we give it all to make you happy. Let’s remember last season we started with a home defeat and I felt a little tsunami around the club. There was pressure for us to sign players and scepticism. We showed we were united, together and ready to work hard. What has changed compared to a few years ago is other clubs have resources so top players have more choices. We signed Ozil which gave us comfort. We made 79 points and you have to be consistent for that. It was extremely paradoxical. When we lost, we lost [heavily]. We lost five or six. If you concede the first goal in a big game 85 per cent of the time you will lose the game.' Majority shareholder Stan Kroenke has taken to the floor: . 'We are proud of what we've accomplished. What a wonderful day that was at Wembley. One of the reasons we were interested in Arsenal was because of Arsene Wenger, and we look forward to much more success with him.' SAMI MOKBEL: The formal business of these AGMs are always mind-numbing but essential. Deloitte re-appointed auditors. Josh Kroenke appointed to the board. We start with a question concerning the £3million fee paid to Kroenke Sports Enterprises that was highlighted in recent accounts. Sir Chips Keswick answers: 'The fee was proposed by the myself and Lord Harris for the services of Kroenke Sports Enterprises. There was no competitive tender for this process as it was directly available to us and would have been inappropriate.' On this very day a decade ago, Arsenal went a 49th game unbeaten with a 3-1 victory against Aston Villa - the final match of their unbeaten run . ‘At the time when you do it, it just looks normal and natural,' said Wenger earlier on Thursday. 'When I look back at the photos today and I see the quality of each player, I think that’s where you realise that it was an exceptional team. Not only those who played regularly, but also those who were on the bench. 'It had never been done in the Premier League until then and I can’t remember anybody winning the championship without losing a game. I’m very proud of that because there’s not a lot of room to do better. Apart from that, the quality of the players I had was absolutely exceptional.’ Come on, Arsenal fans, we want to hear from you. What should Wenger, Gazidis and Co be saying today? Send us a tweet and we'll get the best opinions up on the site... Back to Twitter and Santi Cazorla, one of the Premier League's smallest players, has revealed he can walk under team-mate Per Mertesacker's legs without ducking. 'It's easy for me because he's so tall,' Cazorla says. 'He's a great guy.' Stay tuned for more ground-breaking revelations… . And now, for the first time today, we cross over to our man reporting at the Emirates Stadium. Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me the great pleasure to introduce Mr Sami Mokbel. 'Anticipation building here in the Woolwich Suite at the Emirates Stadium ahead of this year's AGM,' Sami reports. 'The FA Cup win should take the edge off things, but it still could be feisty. It kicks off in 10 minutes or so.' While we wait for the AGM, a selection of Arsenal players have been answering questions sent in by the club's fans. Mathieu Flamini has described Gunners legend Dennis Bergkamp as Arsenal's finest player and revealed Tomas Rosicky is his best mate at the club: 'I've known him for 10 years now and I know everything about him... including his secrets!' Oo-er. Arsene Wenger has completed his morning press conference and will join members of Arsenal's board for the AGM, which begins at 11.30am. The Frenchman has revealed that defender Laurent Koscielny is out of Saturday's home clash against Hull City, along with Mesut Ozil, who has a knee injury.

"Tottenham are sweating on the fitness of Nacer Chadli ahead of the weekend clash against Manchester City. The forward, Spurs top goalscorer this season with four goals, has suffered a hip injury whilst on international duty this week. The problem caused him to miss Belgium's draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina last night. Nacer Chadli trains with Belgium but has picked up an injury that could rule him out for Tottenham . Chadli played in Belgium's 4-0 win over Andorra last week, continuing his good start to the season with a goal . Spurs will assess the injury over the next 48 hours before making a decision on his availability for the clash with the Barclays Premier League champions. Chadli has impressed for Mauricio Pochettino's side this season and his injury will come as blow ahead of the trip to the Ethiad Stadium. Meanwhile, Tottenham sources insist reports linking the club with Sevilla sporting director Ramon Rodriguez Verdejo are wide of the mark. Chadli has scored four times for Spurs this season, topping the club's scoring charts in the Premier League . Verdejo, also known as Monchi, has been tipped to replace Franco Baldini at White Hart Lane in time for the start of next season but those claims have been dismissed.

"Tottenham are hopeful Nacer Chadli is winning his race time to be fit for Saturday's crunch clash against Manchester City. The Belgium international has returned to the club's Enfield HQ after sustaining a hip injury whilst on international duty. Manager Mauricio Pochettino doesn't want to rule Chadli, one of his key performers so far this season, out of the clash against City.

Tottenham are hopeful the forward will prove his fitness ahead of the clash against the champions - but will leave a decision on his availability as late as possible. It is understood Chadli first felt the hip problem during the closing stages of the win over Southampton. Chadli has scored four times for Spurs this season, topping the club's scoring charts in the Premier League . He was deemed fit enough to play against Andorra last Friday, but was ruled out of the draw against Bosnia and Herzegovina on Monday night.

"UEFA has confirmed disciplinary proceedings have been opened against Partizan Belgrade over the anti-Semitic banner displayed by their fans during the Europa League tie against Tottenham on Thursday night. The news came after the Serbian club moved to distance themselves from those supporters, issuing an apology and branding the incident a 'mindless act'. A number of the club's supporters unfurled the sign during the opening group game based on the Only Fools and Horses logo, with the words changed to 'Only Jews and Pussies'. VIDEO Scroll down to see Partizan fans riot in 2007 . A 'Only Jews and Pussies' banner among the home supporters in Partizan Stadium on Thursday night . The 'Only Jews and Pussies' banner was an allusion to the comedy show Only Fools and Horses . The apology, released through Partizan's official website, went on to say that the club will endeavour to ban those found guilty of displaying the banner. 'Dear football aficionados in Serbia and Europe,' it read. 'The football match between Partizan and Tottenham was eagerly awaited in our city and we watched fine performances from both teams in a fair-play sporting atmosphere. 'But this game was marred by malicious act of certain individuals who made all the efforts from our players and our club to prove we deserve our spot in football Europe worthless. 'FC Partizan resolutely disavows with anti-Semitic banner displayed yesterday. The message displayed on that banner is completely opposite to preferences and opinions of almost all citizens of Serbia and Partizan fans. 'It is absolutely absurd to link a club that was founded after the WWII on anti-fascist principles and after the battle of people of Europe with anti-Semitism and similar dark and anti-civilisation impulses. 'We fully condemn perpetrators of this mindless act, not only of anti-Semitic nature, but one that represents hatred of Partizan and Serbia as well. 'We believe this vicious action will not spoil our sporting friendship with Tottenham and football aficionados in Great Britain. In cooperation with competent authorities, Partizan FC will do everything to locate, trial and ban those perpetrators from sporting fields. 'We apologise to everyone who found themselves insulted and upset by this banner. Once again, we point out that such a banner message is completely opposite to history and tradition of our club, and our fans' aspirations.' Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino condemned the anti-Semitic banner . A pitch invader is detained during the Europa League clash in Belgrade on Thursday night . Delegates from European football’s governing body were made aware of the banner before half-time, yet no effort was made to take it down. But UEFA are now investigating the incident, confirming on Friday afternoon that it will address the matter at the start of next month. 'Disciplinary proceedings have been opened against FK Partizan for racist behaviour of their supporters, field invasions by supporters, setting-off of fireworks and use of laser pointer. 'The case will be dealt by the UEFA control, ethics and disciplinary body on October 3.' Anti-discrimination body Kick It Out, meanwhile, has urged UEFA to send a clear message to clubs around Europe after the incident. Kick It Out said it had been made aware of the unsavoury scenes via a ‘large number’ of Spurs fans on Twitter and confirmed it had informed Football Against Racism in Europe (FARE). FARE said it has made an official complaint to UEFA, who is officially awaiting the match delegate’s report. There was a large police presence in the stadium despite only 150 Spurs fans making the trip . ‘These incidents seem to be happening in particular countries and in certain parts of Europe where they don’t take them as seriously as we do on our shores,’ Kick It Out’s media and communications manager Richard Bates said. ‘Incidents aren’t dealt with in the appropriate manner within those countries - if they don’t take a firm stance and they’re allowed to slide, the reality is it will continue to happen. ‘We need UEFA to take a lead, which they have done more over the last couple of years, and demonstrate clearly that these sorts of incidents are completely unacceptable.’ Bates added: ‘It’s always disappointing when any incident like this occurs. ‘It’s disheartening, it’s not acceptable in any way and, after a thorough investigation, it needs to be dealt with in the appropriate manner.’ Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino branded the banner as ‘unacceptable’ and ‘disrespectful’. He said: ‘I didn’t see (it) but the club is aware. It is very disrespectful. It is a shame as it was a great atmosphere. It is very disrespectful, unacceptable and a massive problem for us.’ If Partizan are found guilty they could have part of their ground shut for European competition.

"Mauricio Pochettino insists the Europa League is a priority for Tottenham despite the decision to leave a host of first-teamers behind for their clash against Partizan Belgrade. Spurs kick of their European campaign here in Serbia tomorrow night, but they go into the clash without Emmanuel Adebayor, Younes Kaboul, Danny Rose, Moussa Dembele and Nacer Chadli who have all been left back in England. Pochettino, however, insists his decision to leave behind a number of his top stars does not reflect his attitude towards the Europa League. Mauricio Pochettino insists the Europa League is a top priority for Tottenham this season . Star striker Emmanuel Adebayor is one of many Tottenham players not to travel to Serbia . 'We have a strong squad and we need to choose the best players for Thursday and those in the best condition to play against Partizan Belgrade,' Pochettino said at his pre-match press conference when asked about his decision to leave several stars behind. 'We decided not bring Adebayor, Kaboul,  Rose, Dembele and Chadli for different reasons. 'Yes, yes, of course the Europa League is a priority for us. All competitions are priorities for us,' the Argentina added. 'This year it is very important because the Europa League gives you the possibility to play in the next Champions League. It is an important competition for us. 'For me all my players are stars. But when we come to a different period, or a different problem or situation we have to analyse the squad and see what is the best condition for us to get three points. but for me Tottenham have a strong squad with different names.'

"When Ronald Koeman had a quiet word in Nathaniel Clyne's ear earlier this summer, not even the Dutchman could have known the impact it would have. New managerial appointments often breed apprehension among players. Am I in the team? Am I out? Will he keep me? Will I be sold? Clyne was no different. That was until a conversation with his new manager during pre-season. Nathaniel Clyne scored the winning goal against Arsenal in the Capital One Cup on Tuesday night . Clyne's effort rocketed in from 30 yards as Southampton stunned the Emirates . The Southampton defender has shown he is among the most consistent defenders in the league . Clyne is congratulated by Southampton team-mate Jose Fonte after their 2-1 away win at the Emirates . The defender was told in no uncertain terms by his new boss that he would be the club's first choice right back this season. It was music to Clyne's ears; with the seeds from that discussion now bearing fruit. His performances so far this season have been excellent. So good in fact that there's now a growing clamour for him to be given England recognition. More performances like his against Arsenal on Tuesday night then surely Roy Hodgson will have to sit up and take notice. 'Yes, I think he is ready for England,' said Koeman. 'He has a lot of experience. He is playing very well from the beginning of the season and scored a great goal and his performance is very good and he is an option for the national coach. 'But I’m very happy to have him in our team because he brings a lot of quality and experience. It is very important for the team.' So it raises the question, have Manchester United bought the wrong Southampton full back? Luke Shaw's talent is undoubted, and if all goes according to plan, will become one of the world's elite left backs. Manchester United splashed out £30million on Southampton's former left back Luke Shaw . Louis van Gaal also decided to bring in Argentina's left-sided defender Marcos Rojo from Sporting Lisbon . But the capture of Marcos Rojo, who can play at left back or centre back, has raised doubts over Shaw's place in Louis van Gaal's plans. As did comments from former United coach and Van Gaal's countryman Rene Meulensteen, who claimed the Old Trafford manager doesn't rate Shaw. Van Gaal also has problems on the other side of his defence. Rafael currently occupies the right-back spot, despite the fact the Dutchman was open to selling him in the summer transfer window. Perhaps a look at the other side of Southampton's defence last season would have been more beneficial for United. Van Gaal was willing to sell Rafael, pictured with Wayne Rooney and Mark Clattenburg, during the summer . Clyne's rise to prominence has been steady. Neil Warnock, during his first stint in charge at Crystal Palace, plucked the unknown Clyne from the club's academy and straight into his first team in 2008. All the hype at the time centred on Victor Moses and John Bostock. Very little had been mentioned about Clyne - who was just 17 at the time. But it didn't take long for the youngster to establish himself as the club's first-choice right back ahead of the experienced Danny Butterfield. Clyne was attracting attention from Manchester United and Arsenal during his time at Crystal Palace . It didn't take long for Premier League scouts to take notice, either. Arsenal and Manchester United were regulars at Selhurst Park to keep tabs on Clyne. However, it was Wolves who put their money where their mouths were in 2010, as they saw a bid for Clyne accepted only for the defender to turn down a move to Molineux. Two years later, however, Clyne got his switch to the Premier League, with newly-promoted Southampton signing the defender on a four-year deal. More performances like Tuesday night's and Clyne could be on the move again before too long.","Southampton ace Nathaniel Clyne scored the winner against Arsenal on Tuesday night .

Speaking after the loss in Dortmund, the Gunners midfielder insisted he was 'fine', and the medical examinations have supported Wilshere's immediate assertions. Wilshere received lengthy treatment on the pitch in the closing minutes of the  defeat in Germany but hobbled through to the end because Arsenal had already used their three substitutes.

"Tottenham defender Danny Rose has been spared an uncomfortable reunion with the man who racially abused him two years ago. Rose has not travelled to Serbia ahead of Thursday's Europa League opener against Partizan Belgrade. It means Rose will avoid the prospect of going face-to-face with Partizan midfielder Nikola Ninkovic. Tottenham defender Danny Rose (R) has been left out of the Europa League squad facing Partizan Belgrade . Rose was racially abused by Partizan Belgrade's Serbian midfielder Nikola Ninkovic (L) on U 21 duty in 2012 . Ninkovic was handed a 12-month international ban for making racist gestures towards the England defender . The Serbian FA handed Ninkovic, who was 17 at the time, a 12 month international ban for making racial gestures during a clash against England Under-21 in October 2012. Rose was incensed at his treatment during the time of the incident and questioned whether he would ever return to the country to play again. The clash against Partizan was due to be his first return to Serbia since the incident, but manager Mauricio Pochettino has taken the decision to leave Rose back in England. The Spurs chief, however, insists the decision not to include the left-back in his squad has nothing to do with that unsavoury night. Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino insists he has only left Rose out of his squad due to fatigue . Striker Emmanuel Adebayor has also been rested, despite the manager claiming the competition is a priority . ‘No, it’s not for that reason that he did not come,’ said Pochettino. ‘It is because he finished the game at Sunderland and felt a bit tired. I know about the problems two years ago but they are not the reason he is not here now. ‘We know the situation but it is not the reason. He didn’t ask to be left out. The decision was based on football only. All my selection decisions are based on football always. ‘I think two years is a long time. My decision was simply to give him a rest because down to him being tired after Sunderland. Before that he was with the national team for two weeks.’ Rose, who is expected to be available for Sunday’s clash against West Brom, isn’t the only first-teamer to be left behind with Emmanuel Adebayor, Younes Kaboul, Moussa Dembele and Nacer Chadli also missing Thursday's clash. Tottenham players prepare for their opening Europa League clash with Partizan Belgrade in Serbia . Pochettino is adamant, however, that the Europa League remains a priority despite his decision to rest a number of his stars. ‘We have a strong squad and we need to choose the best players and those in the best condition to play,’ said the Argentine. ‘We decide not bring those players for different reasons but the Europa League is a priority for us. All competitions are priorities for us. ‘This year it is very important because the Europa League gives you the possibility to play in the next Champions League.’ Meanwhile, Pochettino has defended his decision to make Younes Kaboul new club captain following the departure of Michael Dawson. Some supporters, who feel the Frenchman is too injury-prone to be skipper, have taken to social media to criticise the decision. Pochettino has defended his surprise decision to make Younes Kaboul (C) his captain at White Hart Lane . But Pochettino added: ‘I don’t take a decision for the feeling from outside the club. Always I take a decision always with my reason and from my point of view to provide to the squad and the club the better condition. ‘If we pick Kaboul or Adebayor it is because we have information from inside that this is better for the squad. ‘Maybe not everyone is happy with all my decisions. But in the end I am the manager and I need to choose.’","Tottenham face Partizan Belgrade in their opening Europa League match .

And he will immediately be presented with the chance to stake a claim to be the club's first-choice central striker in training. Welbeck sees his long-term future playing as a centre forward despite being utilised as a wide man for much of his career. And manager Arsene Wenger wants to utilise his new signing in that position in training this week ahead of Saturday's clash against Manchester City. Given Olivier Giroud's four month lay off with an ankle injury, Welbeck will be given ample opportunity to prove he can play in that role for the Gunners in the Premier League and Champions League. But Welbeck will not have sole ownership of that central striker role he craves, with Wenger still keen to give much-maligned striker Yaya Sanogo a chance to prove he can still make an impact for his side.

An indicator of the excitement around the first tee in the morning was the way Michael Jordan mingled among the public, going virtually unrecognised. This despite him sporting his trademark No 23 on the green armband he wears for his American TV work. Michael Jordan was among those watching the action between Europe and USA on Friday at the Ryder Cup . Michael Jordan may not have been impressed by what he witnessed by his countrymen in the Ryder Cup so far . FAIRWEATHER WEBB . Webb Simpson’s poor morning showing will fuel criticism of Tom Watson’s hunch to select him as a captain’s pick. Watson justified the decision by saying Simpson plays well at this time of year, ‘after the Solstice’, which came last Monday. Webb Simpson (pictured) was picked by Tom Watson for USA but he put on a poor performance on Friday . PASSING THE BUCK . A deer almost stopped play before the second singles match featuring Thomas Bjorn and Martin Kaymer, scampering up the fairway before disappearing into the woods. Wildlife abounds in this area of Perthshire, including the protected black grouse. A deer almost stopped play as Thomas Bjorn and Martin Kaymer got going in the 2014 Ryder Cup on Friday . CUP DRAWS THE CROWDS . The 45,000 attendance shows the allure of the Ryder Cup. Scottish crowds have not been so enthusiastic for non-St Andrews Open Championships of late. Crowds were well down at Muirfield last year, drawing only 142,000 people overall, while Turnberry five years ago drew a relatively paltry aggregate of 115,000. The 45,000 attendance  shows the allure of the Ryder Cup after interest fell in certain tournaments previously . VICTOR'S PITCH AND RUN . Frenchman Victor Dubuisson got caught short after answering a call of nature between the 11th and 12th hole. He went into the neighbouring convenience carrying his putter and then left it in there — luckily accompanying vice-captain Padraig Harrington was on hand to go back and retrieve the vital piece of equipment.

"Pardon the pun: but Jack Wilshere is a...Jack of all trades. But now, perhaps, he's found one he can master. The Arsenal midfielder excelled in a deep-lying midfield role in England's excellent 2-0 win in Switzerland on Monday night. Under Arsene Wenger, the 22-year-old has been deployed in various midfield roles - he's even been played out on the right-hand side in certain games last season. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Jack Wilshere: I'll study Pirlo to improve my game . New role: Wilshere was asked in the week to step into a deeper position for his national team . Versatile: The Arsenal man can play in any of the three central midfield positions at his club . Improving: The Arsenal midfielder was happy with his first game in the position, but wants to get better . He grew up as a No. 10, used in the area behind the strikers, where his ability to slip in intricate through balls destroys defences. But the presence of Mesut Ozil and Santi Cazorla means he is way down the Arsenal pecking order to play in the 'hole'. You can like our Arsenal Facebook page here . Then there's the advanced central midfield role, but Aaron Ramsey has that position on lockdown at the moment. That leaves one position left in the Arsenal engine room: central defensive midfield. Attributes: Arsene Wenger believes his midfield man has the abilities to play further back . Strong: Wilshere has always been a player who can dive into a tackle, but can improve that part of his game . Covering: The 22-year-old midfielder was required to do a lot more defensive work against Switzerland . Wenger has been criticised by Arsenal fans for not signing a new deep-lying midfielder during the transfer window, despite strong interest in Sami Khedira, William Carvalho, Lars Bender and Morgan Schneiderlin. But is there a method in his perceived madness? As Sportsmail revealed in July, Wenger believes Wilshere has the attributes to play in that holding role. The Arsenal manager has gone on record to say he prefers Wilshere in an advanced role, but the question is: does he get in Arsenal's full-strength midfield? Arguably, not. Who needs a new signing? Wilshere can slot into the role Arsenal fans hoped would be filled by Khadira . Watching on: Arsene Wenger has overseen Wislhere's development from young hopeful to England star . But the one position he does have a chance of nailing down is that deep-lying role. He certainly has it in the locker. He's an accurate and economical passer, who, even at the age of 22, has an understanding of the game way beyond his years. However, he does lack, to a certain degree, a physical presence. At 5ft 7ins he isn't the biggest, particularly compared to the likes of Premier League monsters Yaya Toure and Nemanja Matic. Setbacks: The 22-year-old has had injury troubles but hopes to be over the worst of them now . But Mikel Arteta or Mathieu Flamini, his prime competitors for that role, aren't particularly imposing either. So, until Wenger bites the bullet and signs a dominant central midfielder supporters so desperately want, then Wilshere has the opportunity to make that position his own. The willingness is certainly there: 'I spoke with the manager and Gary Neville in the week and they told me they wanted me to play that role and I quite enjoyed it, . 'It was my first time ever playing there, so over the next month or so I am going to look at a few videos of the game and of players who play in that position regularly - Pirlo, Mascherano and players like that and I'll get better. 'I felt it went well tonight but next time we meet up I feel it can only go better.'","Wilshere has usualy played further forward but showed on Monday that he can perform in the holding role .

"When Francis Benali arrives at St Mary's on Saturday, he'll be emotional. The former Southampton hardman may even shed a tear, perhaps not something you would expect from a man of his reputation. But consider this. How would you feel after running close to 1,000 miles in three weeks? Pretty emotional, probably. Test: Benali (left) is running the 1000 miles between every Premier League ground in just 21 days . Power: The former Southampton full-back poses by the pitch after reaching Leicester's King Power stadium . Well, when Benali reaches the final stop of his tour of all 20 Barclays Premier League grounds ahead of Southampton's clash against West Ham this weekend, that's exactly what he would have achieved. Twenty-one days of agony, ice-baths and sleep deprivation - all in aid of Cancer Research UK. 'I've always been interested in extreme challenges such as this and the idea to do something like this has been floating around in my head for about three years now,' Benali told Sportsmail. 'And then came the moment where I just thought: ""It's now or never"". I always wanted a challenge to be based around football given I used to be professional, so this sounded like a perfect idea - though halfway through, I'm not so sure now! Emotional: Although the physical pain is tough, it's the mental test that Benali is finding hardest . 'The idea of seeing how far you can push yourself has always intrigued me.' Benali, now 45, knows a thing or two about putting his body through the mill. Over 300 league appearances for the Saints between 1988 and 2004 speaks for itself. But the former Saints full-back is quick to point out that his years as a Premier League footballer pales in comparison to his current challenge of running, on average, 50 miles a day. Helping out: Benali battles with Alan Shearer but his former teammate is helping him along the way . 'Obviously the pain threshold is the biggest difficulty you face,' said Benali. 'It's a different type of fitness to playing football professionally, this is more about the mind when you can barely put one foot in front of the other. 'Nothing can prepare you for that. The extent of my training was going on a 40 miler, but I had two days off after that. 'So you know you can run the distance, it' just having the mindset to tell yourself you have to do it everyday. That's the hardest thing. 'Some days you get through it, some days you can hardly put one foot in front of each other. Stretching the limits: Running an average of 50 miles a day, some days Benali runs longer than he sleeps . 'Some days I finish running, take an ice bath, eat and fall straight into bed and have to do it all over again. Some days I'm running longer in a day than I'm sleeping at night. 'Some days I just can't eat anything, I have no appetite. Obviously my support team are keen for me to stay sufficiently refuelled for the next day, but some days I just can't physically eat anything. 'That is perhaps the hardest thing. The running, yes, it's painful but you get through it. 'But it's the mental and emotional battle that is the hardest to deal with. All the days are blurring into one at the moment. 'The other day I just burst into tears when I finished for the day after seeing my family. You don't expect that to happen. Mental strength: 'It's a different type of fitness to playing football professionally,' says Benali . 'You can prepare physically, but it's the emotional side you can't prepare for. But that was part of the intrigue for me, how far you can push yourself, what your limits are.' Thankfully, Benali has been helped along the way during his gruelling personal battle across England's footballing landscape. He's managed to rope former team-mates Alan Shearer, Matt Le Tissier and James Beattie into helping him along on certain legs, while current top-flight stars Dean Hammond and Danny Ings have also lent their support. Southampton's promising start to the season will have also helped Benali's mood along the way. Many had tipped the south-coast club as relegation contenders following the departure of manager Mauricio Pochettino to Tottenham, as well as the likes of Luke Shaw, Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert, Calum Chambers and Dejan Lovren. But under the guidance of new manager Ronald Koeman, Southampton have lost just one from their opening three game - a narrow defeat at Liverpool. Exhausted: By the time he arrives at St Mary's on Saturday Benali will have been to all 20 grounds . Hardman: The fullback had a reputation as a tough guy but he admits to breaking down during this journey . Staying positive: Benali believes that Koeman's men can have a good season despite a tough summer . 'People had Saints tagged as relegation candidates, but I was always pretty confident, I suppose I'm always a confident and positive person,' added Benali . 'People were questioning why were selling so many players, in many ways we were victims of our own success. But Koeman needed time to get his players in and he looks to have signed some real real quality there. 'So I was never one who feared the worst.' You'll need all that positive thinking this week, Francis. Former Southampton footballer Francis Benali is running 1000 miles in 21 days to every Premier League club, covering between 45 and 50 miles a day for Cancer Research UK. . Benali will be arriving at the Liberty Stadium in Swansea on Saturday at approximately 10-10.30.

"Slowly but surely, signs of the Andy Murray who won Wimbledon last year are starting to re-emerge, as he claimed his second title in four weeks. The Vienna Open is not SW19 but a remarkable 5-7, 6-2, 7-5 victory over world No 5 David Ferrer gave a reminder of why Murray was a fixture among the so-called Big Four for so long. At the moment the goal is merely to be in the top eight that will qualify for the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals at the O2 Arena next month, and he went some way to achieving that by winning in the Austrian capital. VIDEO Scroll down to watch the moment Murray clinched victory in Vienna . Andy Murray proudly holds the Erste Open trophy after his victory in Vienna . A dejected David Ferrer watches on after he lost out to Murray in the final . Murray is overjoyed after his comeback victory against Ferrer to claim the Erste Open title . The 27-year-old broke his opponent three times in the final set to see out the match . In battling back from 3-5 down in the deciding set Murray elevated himself into eighth position in the race to London with two events remaining. 'It will be close,' he rightly cautioned after toppling the indefatigable Spaniard in a match of frequent service breaks by two of the game's great returners. Barely 100 points separate the Scot, Ferrer and Canada's Milos Raonic in competition for the few remaining slots. Grigor Dimitrov is not out of it either. The 250 points that Murray will get as the winner of Vienna are useful but an awful lot can change in the next fortnight with 500 on offer this week in Valencia or Basle and 1000 for the Paris Masters next week. Murray won his second title in three weeks after rallying to defeat Ferrer 5-7, 6-2, 7-5 . Ferrer was leading the Scot 5-3 in the final set before Murray staged his title-winning comeback . Matters might yet be made easier if Rafael Nadal withdraws from London to have surgery, something the French Open champion repeated was possible. Murray could not afford to celebrate too much — 'maybe one glass of champagne tonight, but not more than that' — as he headed straight for Valencia, where he is expected to be reunited with head coach Amelie Mauresmo. It will be his fifth straight tournament in five weeks. For Murray, Sunday's ranking-points boost will be outweighed by the intangible worth of coming through an extremely tough contest against an opponent who famously never gives it away. The Scot remonstrates with Ferrer after a contentious decision during the final set . Murray feels the strain in the early stages of the match after Ferrer claimed the first set 7-5 . These are the building blocks Murray needs to put in place to return to the top of the game. This was the kind of eye-catching win that has been lacking since his return from back surgery in January. It looked as if he had suppressed the difficult Spaniard on this brisk indoor court when he pulled ahead in the second set after a tight opener. Murray looked to be cruising when he went 2-0 ahead in the decider, only to concede the next four and get broken again when he had pulled back to 3-4 on serve. Murray will be switching his focus to the Valencia Open 500 after his victory in Vienna . As Ferrer served for the match Murray finally opened his shoulders to hit out in glorious fashion. At 5-5 he broke with a backhand return winner and served out comfortably, winning with an ace that was initially called out. And so his late entry was ultimately rewarded. Losing this final would have been a massive blow, given the amount these two took out of each other in a physical battle. At this rate there will be a lot of tired bodies by the time the key event in Paris begins a week on Monday.","Murray becomes only fifth active player to win 30 or more titles .

"Turkish legend Tugay wants to make a shock return to English football by becoming next Cardiff City manager. The Championship club confirmed on Thursday that Ole Gunnar Solksjaer has left his role following the club's disappointing start to the Championship season. And Sportsmail understands Tugay is keen on replacing the Norwegian at the Welsh club. Former Blackburn Rovers midfielder Tugay (above) is keen to become the next Cardiff City boss . The Cardiff hierarchy are aware of the 44-year-old's interest in the role, but it remains to be seen whether the club view the Turk as a viable option. Dundee manager Paul Hartley is understood to be the front-runner for the job, while Tony Pulis and MK Dons boss Karl Robinson are also said to be in the running. Tugay was Galatasaray's assistant manager, serving under Gheorghe Hagi and Roberto Mancini, between 2010 and 2014 but left the club this summer following the departure of the Italian. Cardiff City have confirmed that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer (above) has left the club . But he is now keen on assuming a managerial role and views Cardiff as a perfect place to start. Tugay, who played 94 times for Turkey, has vast experience of English football as player after a nine year spell at Blackburn Rovers.

"If America are to topple Europe then someone may need to produce the kind of extraordinary performance Larry Nelson mustered 35 years ago. It was 1979 when the Vietnam war veteran and eventual three-time major winner won all five points in a Ryder Cup match, a feat that no other man in history, not even Ian Poulter, has been able to emulate. Nelson was a rookie and had never even experienced matchplay golf before that match at the Greenbrier in West Virginia, where he took down Seve Ballesteros four times in three days with the Spaniard at his peak. Larry Nelson (left) and Curtis Strange (right) on their way to victory for the US in the 1979 Ryder Cup . Nelson, now 67, is the only Ryder Cup player to have won all five points at the tournament . Speaking on Thursday from California’s Pebble Beach, Nelson, now 67, talked of his admiration for Poulter and how he believes the relatively humble beginnings they share is connected with them achieving great things in the team competition. ‘It’s probably not coincidence that we come from similar backgrounds,’ said Nelson. ‘He’s more outgoing than I was but we are sort of blue-collar players who came through late, which maybe makes you want it more.’ While Poulter’s rise from the pro shop has been remarkable he has nothing on the story of Nelson, who only took up the game at 21 once he had come back from serving as an infantryman in Vietnam. Nelson faced and beat Sever Ballesteros, then considered the world's best player, four times in 1979 . Before winning two USPGAs and a US Open, Nelson made his name at the 1979 Ryder Cup, where he and Lanny Wadkins beat Ballesteros and Antonio Garrido three times in four-man competition before he beat the Spaniard again in the Sunday singles. ‘I was a squadron leader in Vietnam and the teamwork and camaraderie aspect came very naturally. That also put the pressure of sport into perspective. After being in the army I was always just happy to see the sun rise in the morning.’ There was no other magic secret to his performance for the 5-0 whitewash, which he followed up with a 4-0 in the event two years later. The US team won 1979's Ryder Cup 17-11:  Back row, standing, left to right - Tom Kite, Mark Hayes, Lee Elder, Lee Trevino, Billy Casper (captain), Andy Bean, Hale Irwin, Gil Morgan; front row - John Mahaffey, Larry Nelson, Lanny Wadkins, Fuzzy Zoeller and Hubert Green . Nelson went on to win three majors, including this 1983 US Open, but made his name first in the Ryder Cup . ‘It was almost like playing the 18th hole of a major on every hole and that helped my concentration I guess. ‘Because I didn’t go to college, matchplay was new to me, but my military background helped,’ he said. ‘I kept getting drawn against Seve, who was about the world’s best at that time. Some were intimidated by him but it wasn’t a problem, I was not even intimidated by (Jack) Nicklaus. ‘I heard things like Seve might try and psyche me out or put me off but there was no animosity. We actually became quite close after.’ Nelson has continued to play on the PGA Seniors Tour and will be competing this week. But he added: ‘I will be watching, I still love the Ryder Cup. Europe are supposed to win, but neither side will think of that once it starts.’ Nelson draws parallels between himself and Europe's Ian Poulter, who excels in the Cup's team environment .","Larry Nelson beat Seve Ballesteros four times in three days in 1979 .

Overall, 75% of the crowd is expected to be male, while fans are coming from 96 countries, the furthest being New Zealand. A total of 45,000 fans are due to watch each day of the Ryder Cup . USA GO BATTY . Table tennis is taken so seriously by the Americans that Phil Mickelson brings his own bats. But the undisputed No 1 is Matt Kuchar, so good at lawn tennis that he once won the American amateur mixed doubles title with his wife Sybi. WARM-UP STALEMATE . The USA may take it as a good sign that they won this week’s junior Ryder Cup 16-8. However, two weeks ago at nearby Stirling Golf Club, they staged the Fightmaster Cup for golfers with only one arm. Europe came out as 21-7 winners . American Rickle Fowler (above) is still enjoying the single life . ONLY FOUR FLYING SOLO .

"Tom Watson spoke glowingly on Wednesday morning of how Phil Mickelson has become a leader and of his ability to ‘talk smack’ — and it was not long before the Californian showed exactly what the US captain meant. A few hours later the Californian took careful aim at Team Europe with a bit of ‘smack’ — banter —about how Rory McIlroy and Graeme McDowell are currently on the opposite sides of litigation proceedings involving management issues. By doing so, Mickelson took it upon himself to signal the end of the studiously bland build-up to the Ryder Cup and demonstrate that, in the absence of Tiger Woods, he is a senior figure determined to avoid another reverse at the hands of Europe. Phil Mickelson was talking at a press conference ahead of the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles this weekend . The American golfer has poked fun at Rory McIlroy and Graeme McDowell's ongoing court case . McIlroy chats to Sportsmail's Jamie Redknapp during a practice session on Wednesday . McDowell and McIlroy celebrate together during the last Ryder Cup win at Medinah . His observation, while delivered with a smile on his face, was clearly premeditated and designed to exploit a rare potential crack in the home team’s famously solid resolve. Mickelson was not going to be deterred by the sensitivity of the situation involving McIlroy’s case against his former management company, with whom McDowell is so closely associated. The 44-year-old American’s intervention also showed the well-disguised edge to his personality, for there was probably an element of retribution in the way he drew attention to what is an elephant inside the European team room. Only Wednesday morning McIlroy joked about how, as a bystander, Mickelson ‘nearly hit me off the tee’ with a famously wayward drive in the 2004 Ryder Cup after a change of equipment saw him play poorly in that edition. And then there was the world No 1’s observation two weeks ago that Mickelson and Woods may be playing the ‘last few holes’ of their top-flight golfing careers. McIlroy is suing his former management company Horizon, where McDowell is both a client and shareholder . Mickelson chips out a bunker during the second day of official practice at Gleneagles . Mickelson does not see it that way, or it could just be that this week he feels emboldened by the absence of Woods — his old rival — in an event that has often seen him fail to demonstrate the true depth of his talent. The five-times major winner took a questioner to task for suggesting that his Cup record was a ‘blot’ on his career, but over the 10 occasions he has played he has lost 55 per cent of his matches, more than any other man in the competition’s history. Riling the European team is a high-risk strategy. Mickelson has little form coming to Gleneagles after a poor season in which a second place at the USPGA has been his only top 10 finish. That is one reason why he is only one of the visiting team to hammer the underdog theme, something they clearly see as beneficial. On Wednesday, Paul Azinger, who in 2008 was the last player to captain a winning American team, put out a succinct tweet outlining what he sees as the required mentality in these fixtures: ‘This year @RyderCupUSA has a chip on its shoulder. Normally it’s @RyderCupEUROPE that plays with a chip. Team with biggest chip wins.’ European team captain Paul McGinley chats with McDowell and McIlroy on the course . Justin Rose's group tee off at the 14th on a picturesque Gleneagles course on Wednesday . VIDEO The closing holes at Gleneagles . Mickelson acknowledged that he has had a poor year but was defiant about his prospects. ‘I followed my worst year prior to this in 2003 with one of my best in 2004 and expect to do the same next year,’ he said. More immediately, he agreed that he needs to do some repair work on his Ryder Cup record and confirmed that he will play alongside Keegan Bradley again in a repeat of their successful partnership of 2012. Certainly, Scotland has been a place where he has triumphed before, having won the Scottish Open at Castle Stuart and The Open at Muirfield. In the absence of Woods, Jason Dufner and Dustin Johnson, the US team need Mickelson to perform and add a Ryder Cup to that. USA team captain Tom Watson expects Mickelson to lead the way . Phil Mickelson insists the pressure if off the Americans on foreign soil . He was happy to pursue the Band of Brothers theme: ‘It takes some of the pressure off, knowing that we are on away soil and that we haven’t won away for 20 years,’ he said. ‘The expectations aren’t high but rather than focus on what we don’t have, what we do have is a great group of 12 guys that really enjoy each other’s company and have a lot of fun together, and we have got great leadership. ‘It really has got nothing to do with trying to redeem what happened two years ago.’","Phil Mickelson has poked fun at Rory McIlroy and Graeme McDowell .

"In his choice of vice- captains, Paul McGinley has avoided the charge levelled at Tom Watson that the American management team has a hint of ‘Dad’s Army’ about it. If there is any concern about the European captain’s five wise men it is due to the sheer number of them. There will certainly be any number of opinions for him to draw on, with a broad range of experience, including two men who have won matches themselves in his role. McGinley has explained that he liked the way having five vice- captains worked at Celtic Manor and the extra demands that come with being in charge of the home side require additional support . Team Europe vice captains Miguel Angel Jiminez (left), Sam Torrance (centre) and Jose Maria Olazabal (right) Tom Watson and Team USA's vice captains are Andy North, Raymond Floyd and Steve Stricker . They will be used in a variety of ways: as his eyes and ears out on the course, a source of wise counsel, as morale-boosters and motivators, and taking charge of certain groups of players — in the build-up and during the three days of the event itself. McGinley believes these are people in whom he can place absolute trust. Miguel Angel Jimenez . Beneath his carefree and cigar-chomping exterior the Spaniard is reckoned to have an astute analytical golfing brain. He already has leadership experience, having captained Europe in the much lower profile EurAsia Cup. Completely tuned in with the players, he is likely to be casting his eye over Thomas Bjorn and Victor Dubuisson, among others. Des Smyth . The 61-year-old Irishman has the lowest profile of the quintet. He still plays on the Veterans’ Tour and, like many of his compatriots, was a renowned expert at mastering wet and windy conditions. When McGinley came on to the circuit as a player Smyth served almost as a father figure and mentor to him. He will be a reassuring sounding board for the captain.

This competition’s ultimate wise old bird. Padraig Harrington . McGinley goes back so far with the major winner that they were actually at school together and served a joint apprenticeship playing alongside each other in amateur competitions.

"Victor Dubuisson has been dubbed European golf’s Man of Mystery, and on Tuesday it appeared that it might be in an Austin Powers kind of way. Asked to describe himself, the home Ryder Cup team’s youngest rookie said he was quiet and humble on the course, but away from it ‘I’m very funny and a cool guy’. In fairness, the 24-year-old from the Cote d’Azur was not in his favoured environment, sitting behind a microphone answering questions, and within golf he is renowned for being reluctant to provide much insight into his personality. Victor Dubuisson, 24,  is the youngest member of Europe's Ryder Cup team and is very quiet on the course . The enigmatic Frenchman says he is enjoying working with Europe's Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley (right) Paul McGinley admitted trying to bring him into the team dynamic was a ‘challenge’, while slightly strangely alluding to his ‘Hollywood’ quality in terms of looks and his golfing abilities. ‘It’s very difficult to know quite what to make of Victor,’ said Lee Westwood, while Thomas Bjorn asked, ‘Does anyone really know Victor?’ Graeme McDowell was a little more expansive: ‘I’ve heard him described as an enigma, a tough guy to get your head round what he’s thinking. His sort of relaxed mood and personality could be confused with intimidation and nervousness.’ They all added, however, that they liked what they knew of him and queued up to purr over the skills, notably around the greens, which have propelled him from obscurity to the world’s top 25 within the last 12 months. He came to prominence by winning the Turkish Open last November and wasted little time in showing that was no fluke. At February’s World Matchplay in Arizona he reached the final, with his miraculous recoveries from off the green drawing comparison with Seve Ballesteros. And there have been top-10 finishes in the past two majors. Dubuisson celebrates winning the Turkish Open in November 2013, which propelled him to stardom . McGinley admitted that integrating Dubuisson has been 'a challenge' given the Frenchman's quiet personality . Victor Dubuisson  will be only the third French player in Ryder Cup history. Thomas Levet won one and lost two matches as Europe triumphed at Oakland Hills in 2004 while Jean van de Velde lost his only match in the singles as Europe collapsed at Brookline in 1999. This has made him an unusually big name for golf in France, where his reluctance to give much away has led to a prickly relationship with his home media, with whom he rowed after finishing seventh at Hoylake. Dubuisson has kept details of his early life sketchy but he was born in Cannes and learned to play at Mougins, leaving school before even entering his teenage years. His golfing mentor was his grandfather, who had a major part in his upbringing after the divorce of his parents. Dubuisson (back row, far left) poses with his Ryder Cup team-mates, but he says he's not a natural team player . As he said of himself on Monday, he quickly decided that team sports would not be his thing: ‘I tried to play football but I didn’t really like it. I prefer sports like tennis or golf. You’re on your own and make your own decisions. I don’t think I could play in a collective sport.’ This self-contained nature inevitably raises the question of how he will fit in with the intense group environment of a Ryder Cup week and the japes in the team room that more extrovert members will get up to. Lee Westwood (right) says it's hard to know what to make of the French rookie Dubuisson (centre) Dubuisson has  been compared to the late, great Seve Ballesteros, who captained Europe to Ryder Cup glory . Dubuisson admitted he carefully guards his preparation to deliver his best where it most counts: ‘It’s very important to manage the pressure on the course but it’s even more important to manage it outside the course. When you arrive on the course sometimes you feel like, OK, finally I can just play golf.’ He did stress, though, that he was impressed by McGinley. ‘Paul is really nice with us,’ he said. ‘I know he always tries to make things easy for us.’ McGinley’s attitude is very much vive la difference. ‘There’s something special about Victor,’ he said. ‘And I like the fact he’s different.’ Thomas Bjorn has asked, ‘Does anyone really know Victor?’ as the intrigue around the Frenchman builds .","Victor Dubuisson is the youngest member of the Europe Ryder cup team .

"Roger Federer was so thrilled with reaching the US Open semi-finals after saving two match points that his voice was quivering with the effects of adrenaline and emotion. ‘It’s just unbelievable,’ he told his courtside interviewer with the enthusiasm of a teenager after delivering another late night classic on Arthur Ashe Stadium that saw him squeeze through against Gael Monfils. Except Federer, who plays Croatia’s Marin Cilic for a place in the final, is no teenager. He is the 33-year-old father of four children (two sets of twins), but if that has shaved anything from his desire and competitive spirit it is becoming harder than ever to discern. Victory: Roger Federer beat Gael Monfils 4-6, 3-6, 6-4, 7-5, 6-2 in their US Open quarter-final . It certainly was for the mercurial Monfils, who if he had the same natural appetite for success as the Swiss master would surely have achieved more in a career that has never quite delivered on its early promise. He has not had a coach for 18 months, swigs Coke during the changeovers and seems to make everything up as he goes along with glorious spontaneity. The contrast could not be greater to Federer, who at this stage of his life knows he has to plan everything with the precision that his country’s watches are known for — not just his training but his family logistics as well. That is why he will be favoured to reach a second consecutive Grand Slam final of the season, where he would meet either Japan’s Kei Nishikori or still the tournament’s most likely winner, Novak Djokovic. It is also why he has the resolve to hold off the pair of match points which came at 4-5 in the fourth set in the course of a 4-6, 3-6, 6-4, 7-5, 6-2 victory over Monfils. Impressive: Despite having no coach, and drinking coke during the match, Monfils was impressive . ‘You know, being down match point, it’s just not fun,’ he explained. ‘Because you’re so close to leaving the court with your head hanging down and going to have to do press which is so annoying after you’ve lost. ‘It’s hard to block it out, but you snap back in because you don’t have much time. You’re like “Okay, let me try and hit a good serve. Let’s hope it works”.’ Federer hardly needs the cash or the titles. He has 17 Grand Slams to his name and his nearest pursuer, Rafael Nadal, is currently out with wrist problems. His fortune is estimated to be at least £150million. Stretch: Federer knows how important preparation is for him now that he is 33 . The key to his longevity is the pure and enduring love of the game, the lifestyle, the competition and doubtless the fame. To help sustain him he has hired his childhood idol Stefan Edberg to work with him, and the coaching situations of all four men’s semi-finalists provide a fascinating sub-plot as the event reaches its climax. The four coaches — Edberg, Michael Chang (Nishikori), Boris Becker (Djokovic) and Goran Ivanisevic (Cilic) — read like the semi-final line-up for some ATP Tour Masters event from the early nineties. All are former Grand Slam champions, and their appointments followed Andy Murray employing Ivan Lendl. Champion: Federer has 17 Grand Slams to his name and has earned an estimated £150million . Tennis players are always trying to find an edge and when they see something working for one of their rivals they tend to follow suit. Who knows, maybe in a few years many of the top names will be coached by women. In Federer’s case Edberg was hired more as a part-time mentor at first, although it has developed into something resembling full-blown coaching. The Swede used to hate coming to New York as a player, yet he has spent the time here overseeing his charge’s run into the last four. Becker’s first six months on the job were not considered a success, yet now he is poised to help deliver a second Slam title alongside the Serb.","Roger Federer came from match point down to beat Gael Monfils .

"It was well past 2am at Flushing Meadows and, before jumping in his car to head back to Manhattan, Boris Becker was animatedly demonstrating a forehand stroke to make his point. His coaching client Novak Djokovic had just been pushed hard by Andy Murray on a raucous night in Queen’s but survived to make it into the semi-finals of the US Open. Becker was speaking admiringly of how hard Murray had been hitting his forehand, but suggested it was that effort which lay behind his body stiffening up towards the end of the match. The remedy, he believes, is that this game style must be replicated every time the 27-year-old Scot walks on court, whoever the opponent. Aggression: Boris Becker said that Andy Murray should keep up his aggressive style of play . ‘The first two and a half sets Andy hit the ball as cleanly as I have seen him do it in a long time, he hit the forehand hard but maybe it took its toll,’ said Becker. ‘He is turning his body right round to hit the shot, and it’s made harder by Novak putting so much spin on the ball. It will become easier for Andy if he plays like this day in, day out.’ What Becker saw in the course of a 7-6, 6-7, 6-2, 6-4 defeat for Murray is that it will not be long before the Scot is back in the world’s top five. ‘The serve, forehand and backhand package was Andy at his very best until midway through the third set. I would expect him to have a good finish to the season on that evidence. There’s a good base for him to work from over the next six months. I think it is only a matter of time before he wins a tournament.’ Sidelines: Former Wimbledon champion Boris Becker is Novak Djokovic's current coach . What the German ex-Wimbledon champion had prophesied before the match — that Djokovic’s easier progress through the earlier rounds would be a factor — had come to pass. ‘Sooner or later you are going to play someone who is as good as you are, and you are going to need every bit of energy you have got to beat him,’ said Becker. Afterwards Murray said he was a little disappointed about how his body reacted, given that he began training in Miami straight after Wimbledon. Djokovic observed that, in their matches, ‘I feel like there is a point where I feel I have that edge, you know, maybe physically’. Sitting courtside it was indeed striking how, after long rallies of often brutal intensity, Murray’s chest would be heaving while his opponent would usually look ready to go again. Defeat: Djokovic beat Murray in four sets at the US Open in Flushing Meadows . The Serb got married shortly after his Wimbledon win and his mediocre results in the events leading up to the US Open suggested that he had taken it easy for a considerable period. And yet, in the Grand Slam itself his fitness looks to have been restored to a supreme level. Murray could hardly be more diligent about his physical conditioning, and will have to bring the same level of application to working on his second serve if he is to revisit the heights achieved when Ivan Lendl was his coach. His second delivery can sit up invitingly for the best returners to feast upon. He was broken 20 times in five matches, and that is a major reason why there was less left in the tank when it came to the ultimate battle against Djokovic, who will now face No 10 seed Kei Nishikori in the last four. The Japanese came through his second five-set match in succession to beat Stanislas Wawrinka 3-6, 7-5, 7-6, 6-7, 6-4 and reach his first Grand Slam semi-final. Form: Djokovic had been struggling for form before the US Open and had not seemed fully fit . Considering that Murray returned from back surgery in January, three Grand Slam quarter-finals and a semi-final is respectable and would be considered a dream scenario for all but the very best players. This result leaves him at No 10 in the world, but that is sure to improve from here as he has no ranking points to defend from the corresponding period 12 months ago, when he was having the operation. He will need to perform strongly in the next two months otherwise he will miss out on the points bonanza that is the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals at the O2 Arena in November. Rankings: After a brilliant 2012, Andy Murray slipped down the rankings to No 8 in the world . After a break at home he will play two ATP events in Asia, one of which will be in either Beijing or Tokyo and the other the Shanghai Masters. Then comes the Paris indoor event ahead of the season finale in London. Murray said he will not add extra events just to try to make the field for the O2: ‘I don’t want to overplay. I’ll play the right schedule and just try to qualify.’ Given that what he is really lacking are the opportunities to register wins over top players you would have expected him to speak with more urgency. But it was very late, and Djokovic had ensured he was very tired.","Andy Murray lost in four sets to Novak Djokovic at the US Open .

"Amelie Mauresmo was a long way from being even a glint in Andy Murray’s eye the last time he faced Novak Djokovic in a Grand Slam. So much has changed for both players since the historic 2013 Wimbledon final, including the arrival of new faces in their coaching boxes — two former SW19 champions. Mauresmo is on one side and Boris Becker the other, while the Sphinx of player support benches, Ivan Lendl, has departed to spend more time with his golf clubs and tennis academy. VIDEO Scroll down for Mike Dickson: Always a chess match between Murray and Djokovic . Showdown: Andy Murray will face Novak Djokovic in the quarter-finals of the US Open . Pumped up: Coach Amelie Mauresmo faces her biggest match since taking over as Murray's coach . On song: World No 1 Djokovic is looking to win his second grand slam of the year after Wimbledon glory . Facing the world No 1 in the US Open quarter-final is the biggest test so far for the innovative Murray-Mauresmo axis, as she tries to prepare her charge for the Serb, who looks in irresistible form. While not as stone-faced as Lendl, the phlegmatic Frenchwoman has adopted a stoic presence courtside, even when the 27-year-old Scot is letting off steam by ranting in her direction. It will be a new experience for her, if one that every one of his coaches has gone through before, even Lendl on very rare occasions. Normally Murray does not benefit from such behaviour, although in Monday’s gruelling win over Jo-Wilfried Tsonga it seemed to energise him to fight back. Mauresmo takes a markedly different view to Lendl, who said he would leave if Murray mouthed off to him in matches. Reflecting on how she handles Murray’s sporadic on-court rages she said: ‘I stay calm, I observe. I look at him a lot, see how he reacts to different moments in the match, to different things that are happening on the court, how he then reacts after he is getting vocal or whatever. ‘It’s interesting. Sometimes I like it, sometimes less. We are all different, and the idea is to find what suits you the best. 'I am not sure he got angry, he just pumps himself up in this way. I stay calm almost all the time, but he knows we are there for him, always behind him.’ In some parts of the equality-obsessed New York media Murray is hailed as a hero for hiring a woman, although he has always maintained it was purely about finding the best person to suit him, which happened to be Mauresmo. Flying colours: Murray sailed through a tricky looking match against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the fourth round . Battle: Murray has been troubled a few times on his way to the last eight in New York . Becker admits he was ‘a little surprised’ at Murray hiring Mauresmo, but described the 2006 Wimbledon champion as a ‘very intelligent and pleasant woman who knows the game very well’. ‘The collaboration with Dani (Vallverdu, his assistant coach) seemed to be working very well at the French Open but something obviously wasn’t working quite right for Andy or he wouldn’t have appointed her,’ said the German. Regardless of that, Murray is second favourite  against the man who two months ago deposed him as Wimbledon champion. One reason is their matches tend to be very arduous and Djokovic has spent three and half hours less time on court in getting this far. Dream team: Djokovic receives some advice from his coach Boris Becker at Flushing Meadows . Memory: Murray defeated Djokovic in the 2013 Wimbledon final on a historic afternoon in London . ‘If you do want to win the tournament you want to spend as little time as possible on the early rounds,’ said Becker. ‘I am very pleased Novak has won his matches quickly. He and Andy are chess players on the tennis court and that is why they tend to have marathon matches.’ Djokovic has beaten Murray in four of their last five meetings, that heady afternoon at the All England Club being the exception, although two years ago Murray overcame him in this Arthur Ashe Stadium to claim his first Grand Slam. And with the way things have gone this season the pressure is all on the Serb, which ought to allow the British No 1 to hit freely, and he must ensure that his vulnerable second serve does not end up getting treated like a punchbag.

"Nothing draws a more scathing response from Roger Federer than the suggestion that the established order in men’s tennis may be breaking up, but the evidence continues to grow. This season has yielded four different Grand Slam winners, two of them from left field, and the newest resurfaced on Tuesday, bleary-eyed after three hours’ sleep. Marin Cilic, who hammered a hesitant Kei Nishikori 6-3, 6-3, 6-3 on Monday to win the US Open title, is one of several players putting a fresh complexion on the top 10 that, for the first time in six years, is missing Andy Murray’s name. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Cilic clinches maiden slam . Maiden: Marian Cilic lifts the US Open title in New York, his first Grand Slam of his career .

Disappointed: Nishikori beat Novak Djokovic in the semi-final but couldn't replicate that form against Cilic . VIDEO Cilic clinches maiden slam . Wearied by nightclubbing into the early hours he may have been, but the 25-year-old Croatian was still able to give a reasoned assessment of how things stand. Federer is right that the top three remain in situ, but with Rafael Nadal’s participation for the rest of the season uncertain due to his wrist injury, their lock on the game looks less secure. ‘I felt there was an opening this year,’ said Cilic. ‘Rafa didn’t play the last two months, Stan (Wawrinka) was up and down after his success in Australia, Andy had a back operation and this season didn’t play as great as we have seen him in previous years — so it was an opportunity for other players. ‘The top guys are still going to be there. I don’t know next year if we are going to see more new champions but for sure people like me, (Milos) Raonic, (Grigor) Dimitrov, Nishikori and (Juan Martin) del Potro when he comes back. Team CIlic: Goran Ivanisevic, Marin's coach and long-time mentor, celebrates with his supporters . Delight: Marin Cilic celebrates winning the US Open title, who was a surprise champion in New York . Out: Rafael Nadal has been out injured since losing to Nick Kyrgios in the 4th round at Wimbledon in July . 'I feel our percentages are going to be much higher compared to the usual top four that we have been used to seeing.’ Murray now faces a real challenge to qualify for the eight-man field at the season-ending Barclays ATP World Tour Finals at London’s O2 Arena in November. Barring freak results, or Nadal being absent, there are effectively only three spots still available as Cilic and Wawrinka’s Grand Slam titles will get them in. Murray’s ranking is rather falsely depressed, however, as he did not play from mid-September onwards in 2013, meaning that the only way should be up for him over the next couple of months. Demolition: Cilic completely thrashed legend Roger Federer in straight sets in the semi-final of the US Open . Frustration: Andy Murray has had an inconsistent season since returning from back surgery . He is likely to play four events between now and London (two in Asia and two in Europe) and will probably need to perform strongly in three of them to make it. That is likely to happen if he can replicate the aggressive form he showed for two-and-a-half sets against Novak Djokovic in the quarter-finals in New York. There are likely to be ranking points on offer as the top three’s participation may be limited before November. Aside from Nadal’s condition, Federer may ease off after a heavy schedule this year while Djokovic is likely to be preoccupied with the birth of his first child. Nevertheless, the chasing pack are now emboldened as never before against the quartet who have so dominated the sport — in part due to the influx of ex-Grand Slam winners without much prior experience now working with them as coaches, such as Goran Ivanisevic with Cilic. ‘Before he was with 50 kilos over his back. I told him just go play and enjoy it, show the world what you can do,’ said Ivanisevic, who won Wimbledon in 2001. ‘Ex-players are the best coaches, if they have the time.’ One clear thing has emerged from a less predictable than expected Grand Slam season — there has never been a better time for former champions looking to get back into the game.

"Few athletes enjoy discussing injuries or ailments but for Andy Murray the subject is still preferable to getting dragged into the debate on Scottish independence. After easing his way into the third round of the US Open he was far more comfortable talking about how he has upped his intake of salt to combat cramp than he was the future of the United Kingdom. He swerved the referendum issue as adroitly as he did the threat of Germany’s Matthias Bachinger, who he defeated 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 to set up a meeting this evening with world No 96 Andrey Kuznetsov of Russia.

Against Bachinger on a relatively cool New York evening there was no repeat of the spasms that hindered him in the first round, and in typical Murray fashion he has not left anything to chance in making sure they do not re-occur in the future. This involves raiding the player canteen at Flushing Meadows for the dinky little packets of seasoning that most use purely to add some flavour to their pasta. ‘I have changed a few things, not so much what I’m eating but what I’m drinking. I’m making sure I have enough fluids down me and take a bit more salt to see if that helps,’ he said. ‘There are little one-gram sachets of salt in the restaurant I take. The conditions are tough and you need to make sure you are on top of everything before matches so you don’t get caught out. ‘I don’t weigh food but I weigh myself three times a day — when I get up, normally after practice, and before I go to bed. I know exactly what my weight should be in the morning and in the evening.’ From Russia with love: World No 96 Andrey Kuznetsov faces the former Wimbledon champion in the next round .

Wimbledon                         Quarter-final . US Open                                     ? Evidently that was all part of the review of what happened against in his first-round struggle against Robin Haase. ‘There were no fluctuations earlier in the week in terms of my weight. I had drunk enough in terms of quantity but maybe something was missing. I will make sure I am on top of it for the rest of the tournament.’ The soaring temperatures of the past week — which have seen several players go down with cramp — have now abated and a mild few days are expected as the 2012 champion tries to get past the Russian, who upset Spain’s formidable Fernando Verdasco in five sets. Kuznetsov is a dangerous, flat hitter who after beating Britain’s Dan Evans at Wimbledon — a year ago today Evans came close to beating Tommy Robredo to make the last 16 here — went on to make the fourth round at SW19 . To do that he also had to beat the ultra-tough David Ferrer, so he is not to be underestimated. The 23-year-old is coached by his father and in his spare time likes to drive BMWs and play the guitar. Love game: Andy Murray's girlfriend Kim Sears watches the action under the New York heat . Girl power: The Scot trains with female coach Amelie Mauresmo as he bids to win a first tournament this year . Same again? Andy Murray is hoping to repeat the success he had in winning the 2012 US Open . Five years ago he won junior Wimbledon and a swift ascent was predicted but, as for so many others at that age, it did not work out that way. ‘It was pretty hard, I had some bad periods,’ he said. ‘In the beginning it seemed to be easy that I was going to go to top 100 but I lost some matches. Finally I came to top 100 two years ago, the first time, and then I came to top 100 again this year. I did a lot of work, and now I hope to stay there. Cramps can occur at any time but little is known about their precise causes, partly because they can appear out of the blue. Sometimes underlying health issues such as liver disease can lead to muscle cramps, but for top athletes — some of the fittest people on the planet — cramp can be something of a mystery. It was a widely-held belief that being dehydrated, and therefore having lower levels of salt in your body, could lead to your muscles involuntarily contracting. Though there is little clinical evidence for this, some athletes try to minimise the effects by taking on extra fluids and nutrients. What works for some may not work for others, but clearly Andy Murray feels snacking on salt reduces the risk. ‘I can be aggressive against Andy, there is much less pressure on me than him.’ Murray looked much more comfortable against Bachinger and will not be unhappy if the conditions are windy again, as he showed that there is nobody more skilful than him when it is blowing. Looking further ahead, expectations should not be placed too high as Novak Djokovic, his prospective quarter-final opponent, looks like he has already played himself back into form. Danger ahead! Novak Djokovic is Andy Murray's potential opponent should they both reach the quarter-finals . Keeping schtum: Andy Murray would prefer not to get involved in the issue of Scottish independence .

Knowing all too well of the abuse he would take from either side — getting tired, old accusations of anti-Englishness on one hand or being attacked by the Cybernats on the other — he has taken the easier option and hid behind the fact that, as a long-time Surrey resident, he cannot vote anyway. A shame in many ways, as he is an original thinker and his full view would doubtless be interesting.

"Andy Murray heads into the US Open next week unperturbed by the fact that he has yet to win a title of any sort since Wimbledon last year. The 27 year-old Scot, who has not made a final since returning from back surgery, remains among the favourites to replicate his Flushing Meadows triumph of two years ago despite the recent lack of silverware. 'I’m not concerned,' he said on Friday. 'It’s always tough when you come back from an injury and it always takes time to get the consistency.

'The standard on the tour is very high, there are no easy matches and it is difficult to reach the semi-final or final of a tournament let alone win a title. I think its a very open tour right now. 'I’ve struggled a little bit in the later stages of the tournaments this year but I think I have also put in some very good performances and I’m confident that I’m back to where I want to be, so it’s just a case of being patient and believing in myself. 'Things with Amelie (Mauresmo) have been going well here this year on the practice court, and we had a really good training block in Miami as well. I trained harder and smarter there than I had been able to for a long while, so that’s important, both mentally and physically.'

"If we thought that Andy Murray's final game against Novak Djokovic in the 2013 Wimbledon final was pure torture he almost managed to surpass that last night. Cramping, limping and lolling around like a wounded beast, he stepped out to roll in his serve at 6-5 in the fourth set against Dutchman Robin Haase and, saving three break points, somehow managed to close it out by extracting errors from his opponent. Of course this 6-3 7-6 1-6 7-5 victory in the first round of the U.S Open had nothing like the significance of the SW19 stomach churner, but it completed a bizarre set. Scroll down for video . Relief: Murray reached the second-round of the US Open with an out of sorts victory over Robin Haase . Struggled: Murray reacts to losing a point as the Scot appeared hampered by cramping to his leg and forearm . Injured? Murray was persistently troubled by leg and arm cramps as the brutal conditions took their toll . Hard fought: Despite struggling on serve and with cramp, Murray prevailed 6-3 7-6 1-6 7-5 against Haase . Murray now meets Germany's qualifier Matthias Bachinger, and the one positive of this event's format is that he has 72 hours to right himself after so nearly falling at the first hurdle. Although the hot conditions were punishing on a difficult arena, he was left asking himself how he got into such a state after spending the whole of the post-Wimbledon period preparing himself in the heat of the American summer. There were no hints of any physical difficulties coming in but he was lucky to get away with this. Opponents often get their brains scrambled when faced with someone struggling and that was definitely the case with the brittle Dutchman, who had a foot problem himself. He could not hold his game together after leading 3-0 in the fourth following a run of winning eight games, although made it clear later he was not unhappy with the Scot's's conduct. Soaring heat: The Louis Armstrong Arena was baking hot as Murray nearly let a two sets lead slip . Aller! Murray's French coach Amelie Mauresmo shouts encouragement at Murray during his four sets win . 'I was very surprised it came on so quickly,' said Murray afterwards. 'I started cramping around the beginning of the third set. It was in my quads, traps (upper back) and forearm. The fact that it was the whole body would suggest that maybe it was something to do with my eating or drinking. I need to find out why it happened. I've been training hard. I don't think I was that dehydrated, because I needed to go to the toilet when I got off the court. 'It's not the worst I have ever felt, but it's the worst I have ever felt after an hour and a half of a tennis match. It was tough but it was also tough for Robin.' Murray's physical demeanour was similar to the strange matches he has played in the past at Roland Garros, notably against Finn Jarkko Nieminen and German Michael Berrer. He has ended up winning after looking in physical distress although they were back issues rather than cramp. This time he was icing his thighs, stretching his sides and holding his arms at a strange angle between points to try and relieve the tightness. Again the win was chalked, partly due to his improved returns and also the unforced errors of Haase when he was ahead in the fourth set at 4-2. Stern test: Haase, ranked world number 70, troubled Murray particularly on the Scot's weak second serve . Support: Murray's girlfriend Kim Sears was in the stands to cheer on her man during his first round match . Murray rarely sets foot on the Louis Armstrong Stadium without some sort of drama developing and it has been the scene of many scrapes in the past. It is not, in truth, the easiest place for anyone to play. In addition to the tight dimensions the planes fly close by at La Guardia, it tends to be windy and the stewarding of the largely unticketed crowd on its large banks is invariably a complete shambles. So there will have been some bad memories, including the enormous struggle of three years ago against Haase, when the Dutchman let slip a two set lead. Murray denied, however, that tension contributed to his condition. Neither player ever looked entirely comfortable. Despite serving poorly with five double faults Murray took the first set after opening up a 4-0 lead. Team Murray: The Scot was watched on by his usual entourage including his Mother Judy Murray (far left) He needed to break back to force the tiebreak in the second set, which he edged through 8-6, having been ahead throughout. It was very much a case of getting the job done in perfunctory fashion, and he looked fortunate not to be up against a tougher opponent, especially as his game plan sometimes looked confused with him hanging back in the court. This will have been quite an education for new coach Amelie Mauresmo, who struggles to maintain the same poker face as predecessor Ivan Lendl. Up next: Murray will face qualifier Matthias Bachinger in the second round after he shocked Radek Stepanek . British women's number two Jo Konta later missed her chances in going down disappointingly 6-2 6-3 to Israel's Shahar Peer while Irish qualifier James McGee lost in four to Aleksandr Nedovyesov. Heather Watson plays on Tuesday against Romania's Sorana Cirstea. Nick Kyrgios, the 19 year-old Australian, showed that his Wimbledon dismissal of Rafael Nadal was no isolated feat of bravado when he knocked out hardened 21st seed Mikhail Youznhy in four sets  7-5 7-6 2-6 7-6. He was given three code violations for smashing his racket and swearing, the last of which cost him a game and brought him within one more offence of getting disqualified.","The 2012 US Open champion beat the Dutchman 6-3 7-6 1-6 7-5 .

"Andy Murray needed a tide of energy to supress Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in brutal conditions and he will now need to summon up another one if he is to stay alive in the US Open. A grand slam rematch with Novak Djokovic in the quarter finals was the reward for the colossal physical effort he put in to defeat the Frenchman 7-5, 7-5, 6-4 in two hours and 35 minutes and claim his first win against a top ten player this season. Murray needed to rage at himself – and occasionally his team – as he skilfully fought back to claim the second set in one of his most animated performances since returning from back surgery in January. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic practicing ahead of match . Roar: Andy Murray beat Jo-Wilfried Tsonga to set up a quarter-final against Novak Djokovic at the US Open . Delight: Murray celebrates his win over Tsonga in straight sets on Arthur Ashe Stadium . Even his normally restrained girlfriend Kim Sears was up on her feet as his team tried to sustain him in the kind of heat that is normally accompanied by storms in these parts. 'It was extremely tough, windy and humid,' he said. 'The first two sets were very tough and mentally quite draining, and the third set could have got away. Luckily Jo missed a few serves at the end. 'I've had some long matches against Novak and I hope I can play to my top level. If I do that I will have a chance.' He will welcome a day's rest before what is sure to be a night match on Wednesday. It will be their first meeting since history was made at Wimbledon last year, with memories also of beating him at Flushing Meadows in 2012, and the Serb will not be as generous with the unforced errors as Tsonga was. Cruise: The British No 1 won the first set 7-5  on Arthur Ashe Stadium to take command of the match . Frustration: Tsonga held a break of serve in both the second and third sets but lost them both . The world No 10 is the kind who hits both hot streaks and despondent lulls, and we saw both on Monday. He defeated Murray in their last meeting at the recent Canadian Open when the Scot wasted a 3-1 lead in the deciding set, but this time there was no mistake. By the time they walked on court during the steaming heat of Labour Day afternoon, Djokovic was steadily completing his business, defeating Phillip Kohlschreiber 6-1, 7-5, 6-4. Against a tricky opponent it was not quite the cakewalk the world No 1 had previously enjoyed and he needed to save a break point in the second set. Ultimately he was able to make it into the last eight without dropping a set and he will be totally fresh for the next match. Done and dusted: Murray wrapped up a 7-5, 7-5, 6-4 victory in the last-16 contest . Just as against Andrey Kuznetsov in the third round Murray played a high quality first set and bar an angry blip early in the second, when he began ranting like a late night reveller on Glasgow's Sauchiehall Street, the standard was impressive for the most part. Early on his serve looked nigh on impregnable and break points were forced in the Frenchman's two opening service games. The first was saved by a 130mph winner but the next two saw the Scot getting into the rally before fluffing a forehand and then a backhand into the net. This is the kind of thing that happens when you are short of confidence building wins against the best players. The reason Murray likes this particular match-up most of the time is that he can absorb the power coming from the other end and react to it, which is his natural modus operandi. Watchful eye: Murray's coach Amelie Mauresmo and hitting partner Dani Vallverdu in the stands . Spectator: Murray's girlfriend Kim Sears watches the action on Arthur Ashe Stadium . On her feet: Sears cheers on her man in his last-16 contest in New York . But Tsonga cut down his unforced errors, at least until they got to 6-5 when he was gifted two break points. On the second he made no mistake, driving the return deep into the corner and then running in after it to put away the volley. In the third game, Tsonga got hold of Murray's inviting second serve and nicked a break from 15-40 down when an attempted drop shot faded into the net. Murray berated himself in the manner that he pretty much cut out under Ivan Lendl. 'You're so slow!' she shouted at himself, followed by 'You've got two legs, use them!' All of this gives succour to an opponent and soon the Scot was also unloading at his box to a bemused looking Amelie Mauresmo about his inability to pin down Tsonga, who was forcing him further back in the court. Awaiting: Novak Djokovic is next up in the quarter-finals of the US Open at Flushing Meadows . Eyes on the prize: The Serb star cruised past Philipp Kohlschreiber 6-1, 7-5, 6-4 on Monday . Embrace: Djokovic and Kohlschreiber shake hands after their last-16 match on Louis Armstrong Stadium . Chuntering to himself and abusing his coaching staff rarely works but it fired him up when he blasted two exquisite winners to level at 4-4 with Tsonga's level now suddenly dropping, as it is wont to do. Running in to crunch away some dreadful drop shots Murray suddenly forced a set point at 6-5 and made no mistake with a deep backhand that drew a forehand error to go two sets up. In this punishing arena, complete with humidity, Murray's weeks of training in Miami each year are particularly handy but if Tsonga was downcast by losing five of the previous six games he hid it well by going an early break up. That was wiped out immediately and the pressure saw the Frenchman's serve collapse at 4-5 with two double faults that let Murray close it out.","British No 1 moves into quarter-finals of US Open in New York .

"Prior to the storming run that has taken Caroline Wozniacki to the semi-finals of the US Open she spoke of not wanting to be constantly associated with her former fiancé Rory McIlroy. 'I don't want to have my name stuck with him forever,' she told the New York Times. 'I'm my own person, I have my own career.' As ever actions speak louder than words, and nothing could have shouted out that sentiment more than the form she has shown at Flushing Meadows, where she now meets the unseeded Chinese Peng Shuai. She has given herself a great chance to make a second Grand Slam final. Andy Murray will try to join her in the last four as he took on Novak Djokovic for the first time since the Wimbledon final last year. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Best friends Caroline Wozniacki and Serena Williams . Back in the swing of things: Caroline Wozniacki has reached the semi-finals of the US Open . Great Dane: The former world No 1 is hoping to repeat her feat of reaching the final in 2009 (R) Wozniacki demolished thirteenth seed Sara Errani 6-0 6-1 in the last eight, continuing the dynamic form that has developed since the abrupt ending of her relationship, which saw her dumped in a brief phone call. The Dane has now tired of fielding questions about that issue, declaring it irrelevant to what has been going on for the past eleven days. You can allow her a bit of disingenuousness on the matter, but the facts say otherwise. Since the French Open, where the hurt was at its rawest, she has collected a 24-5 match record, with two of those defeats coming against her close friend Serena Williams. The last time she was in the last four of a Major was not long after she and McIlroy began dating. The demands of keeping a romance going with two global schedules cost her a top ten place and saw her fail to get past the quarter finals of any Grand Slam after that. Love game over: Wozniacki split from her fiance Rory McIlroy (L) in October 2013 . Moving on: The 24-year-old is looking forward to not always being associated with the golfer . Until now, with her renewed single status having had a galvanising effect. It would be wrong to portray Wozniacki as bitter about the break-up, in fact she has handled it with class and has avoided criticising her ex-partner. 'When it comes out of the blue that's like a shock, it's like someone dies right in front of you.' she said. 'The years we had together were great and unfortunately things had to end like they did.' Williams said she had been struck by her friend's lack of rancour, revealing: 'She said, 'I could never hate him, he has been a big part of my life and even if I wanted to I couldn't hate him.' In tennis-specific terms there has also been an unexpected dividend coming from the cancellation of her wedding. 'Big part of my life': Wozniacki admits she could never 'hate' McIlroy even if she tried . Sealed with a kiss: Wozniacki celebrates after defeating Sara Errani 6-0, 6-1 in the quarter-finals . The nuptials were due to take place in November, and to fill that void she decided to enter the New York Marathon instead. While always among the best movers and most durable of players she has become even better in that department, aided by a slight loss of weight through a form of training that is highly unusual for tennis players, whose joints are quite stressed enough already. Errani plays like a human backwall and her plan is always to get everything back, wear opponents down and make them run, but she was completely overwhelmed by the athleticism on the other side of the net. The concern in Paris back in May was that the trauma of what happened with McIlroy could shatter an already ailing career, but the opposite has proved the case. 'I have proven people wrong so many times,'said Wozniacki after beating Errani.' I was told when I was younger there is no chance I will make the top 100, top 50, top 30. Every time I have proven them wrong. It's kind of nice. 'I feel confident and I feel comfortable out there. I have been playing well in these last few months. It's just nice that it's paying off here.' Eastern promise: Wozniacki faces doubles specialist Peng Shuai in the last four at Flushing Meadows . Her best result in a Slam was reaching the final here in 2009, before making the semis in the next two years. The feeling she has now is more like it was five years ago. 'I have to say the finals in '09 feels closer than the semi-finals of 2011. It's weird. I don't know. I think just because it was such a huge experience for me and it was my first really deep run in a Grand Slam. I'm just so happy to be back in this stage and having another match out there.' At 28 this will be a first Grand Slam singles semi-final for Peng, a renowned doubles expert, and few would bet against Wozniacki rounding off this extraordinary summer for her by making it all the way to the final.

"During Andy Murray’s victorious run at the US Open two years ago, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga issued a cri de coeur that got somewhat overlooked at the time. The gifted Frenchman had been knocked out in the second round and was reflecting on the frustration of playing in the era of the then dominant trio of Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic. Striking an unusual tone of despair for such a genial and easygoing man, he said: ‘I work hard every week, I give a lot of myself every day but I never get rewards. That’s why sometimes it’s tough. I’m not a machine.’ Barely a week later Murray had won his first Grand Slam title, and Tsonga’s words became a measure of his achievement.

The mercurial man from Le Mans has carried on since as one of those players — Czech Tomas Berdych is another — who at a different time in history would have been good enough to claim one of the sport’s biggest prizes. Sometimes this has sapped his motivation, but he arrives for his fourth-round appointment with Murray, which begins at around 7:30pm UK time on Sunday, at a time when his enthusiasm has been fully rekindled and he is ready for the fight. They are trying to reach the quarter-finals, a stage made by Caroline Wozniacki, who out-slugged Maria Sharapova 6-4, 2-6, 6-2 on Sunday to score a hugely popular win and become one of only four top 10 players left in the women’s event. Undone: The British No 1 has a poor record against players in the top 10 so far in 2014 . Sharapova was given a code violation for time wasting and her slow play aggravated the Dane, whose career revival continues after her split from Rory McIlroy. Tsonga underwent a revival of his own when victory earlier this month in the Canadian Open got him inspired after a mediocre first half of the season. In Toronto he defeated Murray, Djokovic, Federer and Grigor Dimitrov all in the same week. The quarter-final against Murray was far more competitive than their meeting in Miami in late March, when Tsonga  was extremely poor. He looked to be going through one of his existentialist phases, wondering what the point of it all was. Battle: Murray has dropped two sets so far en route to the fourth round in New York . Murray, who has slipped to No 9 in the rankings, has pondered the same thing at times, having achieved so much between the Olympics and Wimbledon the following year. Climbing back up the mountain after back surgery must have seemed a forbidding task, but now he has an excellent chance of ridding himself of the statistic that has dogged him since winning Wimbledon — that of not having beaten a top 10 player. Tsonga was No 12 when defeated in Florida and, in pure ranking terms, that has been his biggest scalp this season. The Frenchman is now at No 10, although Murray is dismissive about the significance of that benchmark. Threat: Tsonga has won just twice against Murray in 11 meetings so far in their career . ‘It’s better almost not to think about it too much because I’ve played 500 or 600 matches in my career and you’re going to have moments when certain things are hard,’ he said in the wake of his third-round victory. ‘There are periods when some players struggle to serve out matches, sometimes it can be struggling to come back from tough situations, sometimes it can be struggling to stay ahead or sort of having ups and downs in matches — you’re going to go through that in an 800, 900-match career.’ Tsonga has said he wished he had thought of hiring Amelie Mauresmo, who will be in Murray’s corner for what will be a 12th encounter between the two. Murray, whose game can defuse the Frenchman’s power, usually prevails and he leads their series 9-2. It is their most important meeting since the Wimbledon semi-final of 2012.","Andy Murray takes on Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in last 16 in New York .

The Sheffield Star reported an isolated chant from the Kop shortly after kick-off, before two more chants followed with the home side leading 2-0. Songs referring to Evans 'coming home', as well as support for 'Super Chedwyn Evans' could be heard at Bramall Lane, as United's win took them into the playoffs in League One. Ched Evans was released from prison this week, and Sheffield United fans chanted his name on Tuesday night . Bristol City's Aden Flint heads home in his side's match against Bradford at Ashton Gate .

There has been much speculation over Cuadrado's offer of a new contract at Fiorentina.

"Chelsea striker Diego Costa turned 26 on Tuesday, and he celebrated his big day by scoring an impressive goal in Spain training. The European champions travel to Slovakia for a 2016 qualifier on Thursday, and stepped up their preparations during a training session in Madrid on Tuesday.

Diego Costa picks the ball up after a lofted pass from Jordi Alba, before running at Iker Casillas . He draws the Spain goalkeeper out of his goal, before a feint leaves Casillas scrambling on the turf .

"When Diafra Sakho left the desperate poverty of west Africa to begin his footballing career in France, he had more than enough inspiration to succeed. He arrived in Metz as an 18-year-old looking to kick-start his new life, but soon received news that his father Mamadou had died. His mother was left to take care of four children on precious little income, and Sakho became the sole breadwinner. He says it made him desperate to succeed as a footballer. Diafra Sakho has scored in each of his last four games for West Ham, pictured against Man United last week . Sakho celebrates his goal at Old Trafford, which saw his side pull a goal back against Manchester United . 'Suddenly I was the senior man in the house. The oldest,' Sakho told the Sunday Mirror. 'It was my responsibility to look after them. It made me even more determined to become a footballer.' The Senegalese forward joined West Ham from Metz for £4.5 million in the summer - a move that funded the purchase of a new house for the Sakho family in Guediawaye. Sakho's responsibility since the death of his father, the player admits, was obvious from the moment he found out.

"There has been talk of Lukas Podolski leaving Arsenal in January, but if his Cooper Tyre Challenge performance is anything to go by, maybe Arsene Wenger should try and keep him. Cooper Tire Europe visited Arsenal this week, and set Santi Cazorla, Mesut Ozil and Podolski a challenge, whereby they were instructed to kick a football through tyres lined up in the top corner of a goal. Podolski has found appearances hard to come by for the Gunners this season, but in the challenge between him and his team-mates, it was the German forward that came out on top. VIDEO: Watch the Cooper Tire Europe Challenge at Arsenal's training ground . The challenge saw two targets - one with a single tyre, and the other with four consecutive tyres . The players initially struggled to send the ball through the targets, but Podolski (pictured) won eventually . There were two stages to the test - a single-tyre challenge, preceded by an infinitely more difficult four-tyre version. In the latter, it was Spanish starlet Cazorla that impressed, firing a magnificent strike through all four consecutive tyres - and the ball didn't even touch the sides. The rest of the watching Arsenal squad couldn't resist getting involved, as Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Alexis Sanchez, Jack Wilshere, Aaron Ramsey, Joel Campbell and even goalie Wojciech Szczesny piled in to have a go at the challenge - and, surprisingly, it was only the keeper that managed to score through the hole. In the one-tyre challenge, Cazorla, Ozil and Podolski all managed to fire a football through the target - eventually - although it was Podolski who came out on top. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger watched on as the challenge took place . Wojciech Szczesny was one player who joined in to take a shot - and scored through the tyre . Podolski (left) and Cazorla (right) enjoyed the challenge, and celebrated by signifying hearts with their hands . The only forward of the bunch, you would expect the German international to be up there when it comes to scoring, but Podolski has been on the bench for the Gunners this season and started a little rusty. After numerous attempts, it came down to a sudden death shoot-out between Cazorla and Podolski - Spain vs Germany, midfield vs attack. And it was Podolski who conquered. After making a love heart symbol with his hands, he high fived his Spanish opponent as he celebrated the victory. His long-term future with Arsenal may be in doubt, but you never know... maybe Wenger was so impressed with his tyre challenge, that he'll keep him in north London for a little while longer. Want-away striker Podolski eventually won the challenge, with two points to Cazorla's one . An impressive camera angle shows the ball as it approaches the four-tyre target . Ozil (right) and Podolski (left) are all smiles as they take part in the challenge . Cooper Tire Europe became the first “Official Tyre” of Barclays Premier League club, Arsenal, earlier this year. The partnership reflects the values that Cooper and Arsenal share – a passion for performance and the drive for success. The multi-year deal will see the Cooper Tire Europe, which has its European technical centre and headquarters in Melksham, Wiltshire, support the London club for at least the next five Premier League seasons.

"Alvaro Recoba made a name for himself during a successful 11-year-spell at Inter Milan. But now, at 38, the former Uruguayan international has proved that he can still score stunning goals, by netting directly from a corner for Nacional. Recoba is currently plying his trade in his home country, for Club Nacional de Football, and he wowed the 20,000 strong crowd with an amazing in-swinging corner in his side's match against Montevideo Wanderers on Saturday. With the scores level at 0-0, Recoba stepped up to take a corner on the stroke of half-time, and to the surprise of all those inside Estadio Gran Parque Central, put enough swing on the ball to net directly from his set piece. The Wanderers goalkeeper is helpless to stop Alvaro Recoba's corner kick flying directly into the goal . Recoba (left) celebrates with a team-mate after scoring his wonder goal . Recoba played 248 times for Inter Milan between 1997 and 2008, scoring 72 times in the process.

"Everton's Steven Pienaar has given his heartfelt thanks to first coach and mentor Cavin Johnson in an emotional video posted on YouTube. The clip, created by BarclaysFootballTV, shows a clearly grateful Pienaar welling up as he explained about his early life in South Africa, and admits that he owes a lot to the man who nurtured him through the early stages of his footballing career. Midway through the video, Pienaar is asked what he would say to Johnson if he were in front of him at that moment, and the player's response is then played to his former coach. Steven Pienaar is clearly emotional as he speaks about his youth coach Cavin Johnson . Pienaar dedicates a goal for Everton against Manchester United at Old Trafford in 2012 to God . Pienaar is currently in his second spell at Everton, and has played 164 matches for the Merseyside club . Ajax: Jan 2001 - Aug 2006 . Borussia Dortmund: Aug 2006 - July 2007 .

The two men have clearly been through a lot together, and Johnson claimed: 'We've both helped each other grow. I'm very proud of you - you've become a superstar.' Pienaar explains: 'I've always had a dream to play in the Barclays Premier League, but without coach Cavin Johnson I don't think I would have reached my potential.' The Everton winger went on to describe his early years living in South Africa: 'I grew up on the south side of Johannesburg. Single mother, two brothers, one sister - a very poor town. 'There were a lot of drive-by shootings going on, a lot of innocent people got shot.' Pienaar has faced tough opposition in his career, here pictured chasing Manchester United's Wayne Rooney .

Pienaar moved to Ajax in 2001, a move orchestrated by Johnson. The player, still young at the age of 19, was asked by the Dutch club if he had anyone who could help with the details of his contract. Clearly emotional at this point, the South African explains that there was only one man he wanted to assist him - his father-figure Johnson. Most footballers have someone they owe some of their success to - be it a father, or a father-figure - but Pienaar's coach Johnson seems to have had a bigger impact than most.

"Mauricio Pochettino is not scared to drop his star players from the north London derby, and has told his squad that a good performance against Nottingham Forest in the Capital One Cup could earn them a place against Arsenal on Saturday.

"Jack Butland has welcomed the prospect of England’s Euro 2015 challenge receiving help from above but warned there will be no preferential treatment for star names. With the Under-21s having stylish secured a trip to the Czech Republic next summer, England have already started preparing for the tournaments by lining up two demanding friendlies in November, at home against Portugal and a trip to France. A debate is raging, though, as to which players Gareth Southgate should select. If, for instance, England included all those who were eligible, from players such as Jack Wilshere, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Raheem Sterling, they would have to be considered favourites. Jack Butland (centre) insists any senior players that drop into England's Under 21s are not certain of a start . Defender Luke Shaw (left) played both European Championship play-off legs against Croatia . Loading the squad with high-profile individuals is not something Southgate will do. England will certainly travel with a strong squad but the identity of who goes will be decided by Southgate, Roy Hodgson and Dan Ashworth, the Football Association’s Technical Director. Southgate and Ashworth put individual cases forward to Hodgson for those in the seniors who are eligible to play for the Under-21s and that, for example, is what happened this month with Manchester United left-back Luke Shaw. Hodgson agreed that it would be better for Shaw to play two games against Croatia, rather than spending time on the bench against San Marino and Estonia, and he would also have released Calum Chambers, had Everton defender John Stones not damaged his ankle ligaments. Shaw slotted back into Southgate’s group effortlessly and took nothing for granted and Butland, the Under-21s’ captain, says that is an example others would have to follow if it is decided England’s novices would benefit from taking some who have been with the seniors. Derby midfielder Will Hughes (left) celebrates his winning goal against Croatia on Tuesday with Harry Kane . Raheem Sterling is one of a number of players who could drop down to play at the European Championships . At this early stage, it would be no surprise if Everton midfielder Ross Barkley ended up heading to the Czech Republic, but, for once England are not short of options. ‘That is why it is good being a player not a manager picking this squad,’ said Butland. ‘We have a fantastic amount of talent in this 22 of players. We have had players who have gone up and come down. Luke has come down and it is like he never left. ‘We are confident whoever it is, we will get on really well. We will welcome anyone in. First of all we have to continue play the way we do. If people come down for the seniors it doesn't mean they run things. Everyone works for their position. That is the mentality we have had. ‘Everyone fights for their place so they deserve it. We have to keep that next summer. We have got to carry that forward now to the bigger stage in the summer. Losing and going out was not an option because we have too much talent. Now we need some really tough friendlies. ‘Playing against teams who will push us to the limit. We might lose. But we have got to learn to play against the top teams. We might beat them. That is the only way we will be prepared for the finals next summer. Then we will assess where we are at.’ Senior squad regular Jack Wilshere (centre) will also be eligible to play for the Under 21s next summer . Maintaining the balance and harmony of a group that has won 10 consecutive games and is undefeated in 13 matches will be essential if England are to stand any chance of winning the tournament, something of which Southgate is well aware. He has explained at great length recently what he will be looking at when it comes to picking his final 23, as while some big names could feasibly be picked – like Sterling and Wilshere – Southgate has questioned what they would gain from dropping down to the Under-21s. It will not, however, stop the discussion. Stuart Pearce, Southgate’s predecessor, has consistently spoken out that England will never progress as a football nation until they get into the habit of naming their strongest possible squad for these tournaments. ‘I love him because he fights my battles for me!’ Southgate said with a telling smile. ‘But I set out from the start saying I am not going to worry about who I can’t have. Some of those things will be taken out of our hands with injuries and things like that. ‘I still think if a young player is first choice in the senior team – like Raheem – then it is hard for a development coach to deny them that opportunity. There is a different debate if they are not in the team. Myself and Roy have talked about that a lot and that will be ongoing.’","A number of senior players are eligible to play for England Under 21s .

"And he wonders why it is always him. Just when you thought you had seen it all with Mario Balotelli, he takes the breath away on Anfield’s biggest European night in five years. With Liverpool submerging at half-time, the evening having become an exercise in damage limitation rather than one to tell the grandchildren about as they trailed 3-0, Balotelli decided to swap shirts with Real Madrid defender Pepe as he sauntered off towards the dressing room. Not clever. Not clever at all. Having endured a dismal, uncomfortable start to his time on Merseyside, Balotelli had a glorious chance to show why Brendan Rodgers took a £16million gamble on him in August and made him a Liverpool player. Mario Balotelli swapped shirts with Real Madrid defender Pepe as he wandered down the tunnel at half-time . Balotelli endured another torrid night in a Liverpool shirt and was replaced at half-time at Anfield .

Gerrard gestures that he would prefer to swap shirts with his former team-mate off the field . Arbeloa (left), with Gerrard's shirt he got in the tunnel after the match, and Luka Modric (centre) and Isco . Instead, after barely breaking into a canter and never threatening Madrid’s goal, Balotelli managed to enrage two former Liverpool captains - both of whom had lifted the European Cup - and seemingly lose the trust of his manager. ‘What is going on?’ said Phil Thompson, Liverpool skipper when they beat Real Madrid in the 1981 final in Paris, when learning of Balotelli’s faux pas. ‘Are you joking? Oh my goodness. What is in his mind to do that? He’s having a difficult time as it is. ‘I don’t care whether you’re playing for Liverpool or a Second Division club, you don’t do things like that. It’s disrespectful. That is absolutely dreadful from a Liverpool player. He is lucky to be wearing one, to be playing, the way he’s been playing before. And he gives it away at half-time?’ Meanwhile, Graeme Souness, who captained the Reds when they lifted the trophy by beating Roma in 1984, was simmering with rage in Sky’s Anfield studio, growling: ‘Don’t get me started.’ When Thompson and Souness were leading Liverpool, they guarded that red jersey with their lives. They went to war wearing it in far, foreign lands and would not accept anything but the absolute maximum from those around them. Each time they pulled it on was a privilege. Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher gives his verdict on Balotelli's performance on Twitter . Pepe and Balotelli remove their shirts as they went to walk down the Anfield tunnel with the score at 3-0 . Balotelli and Pepe then exchange words as both players leave the field for the half-time interval . Pepe places his hand on Balotelli's back as the forward leaves the field, not to return for the second-half . Some will no doubt dismiss the shirt-swapping as trivial, another Balotelli eccentricity. Yet the main issue for Rodgers is not the souvenir he collected but what the Italy striker produced in the 45 minutes before his game was curtailed for what were described as 'tactical’ reasons. On the touchline, as Liverpool made a bright start, Rodgers urged Balotelli to press, mouthing the words ‘keep getting into the box’. Liverpool’s manager had said this fixture had the potential to ‘create legends’ - and a Balotelli winner would have sent him on that road. But Rodgers got nothing back from the Italian. Again. Rodgers had faith in his own ability to unlock the talent lurking inside Balotelli and was adamant that the player would seize the opportunity given to him as the transfer deadline loomed in August. Instead, all Rodgers has had since is aggravation. Bar one goal against Ludogorets, Balotelli has not once threatened to show he can be a Liverpool player. He simply does not fit the brand of football the manager wants to play and one wonders how this experiment can work. Mario Balotelli's heat map shows that the Italian striker struggled to impose himself on Real's penalty area . Where does Balotelli go from here? Taking him off after 45 minutes in a game of this magnitude shows that Rodgers does not trust him and another incident bringing more negative PR, after the player's failure to applaud the travelling fans in Basle, is a headache the manager can surely do without. Do not believe, however, that Balotelli - who again refused to talk in the mixed zone as he headed for home with Pepe's shirt stuffed in a clear plastic bag - was the reason Liverpool were flattened. He should not be made a scapegoat. Here’s why: the six attacking players Carlo Ancelotti unleashed on Liverpool cost Real Madrid £271million. Recruiting the most exciting forwards on the planet does not come cheap but the logic is clear: bringing in those with the gifts of Cristiano Ronaldo, James Rodriguez et al  enables Madrid to play a brand of football that almost guarantees goals in the tightest contests. Yet Ancelotti could have spent £271 on new signings to score two of the three goals Liverpool shipped to Karim Benzema. If Balotelli is giving Rodgers problems up front, his defenders are causing even more concern. The issues are mounting.

"So, now England’s best young players know what the international game is all about. And after a match gripped by tension in Wolverhampton, an even bigger test awaits them in Croatia. Under 21 football aims to prepare footballers for elite competition and if England are to reach Euro 2015, they must pass the sternest of examinations. Fortunately for Gareth Southgate, his squad seem to be learning quickly. This could have been a night when their dreams of reaching next summer’s finals in the Czech Republic perished, but thanks to a show of character and quality, England turned a 1-0 deficit into a 2-1 first-leg lead thanks to a header from Harry Kane and a late penalty from Saido Berahino. VIDEO Scroll down for Gareth Southgate's post match comments . Saido Berahino scores the winning goal from the penalty spot for England U21s, securing an important victory against Croatia U21 . Berahino wheels away in celebration after dispatching the penalty he had won for England late in the match against Croatia on Friday . Dominik Livakovic (right) fells Berahino in the area, gifting England U21s the opportunity to win the match from the penalty spot .

Booked: Zuparic 49, Milic 80, Pasalic 81 . Goal: Livaja 13 . Referee: Javier Estrada Fernandez . Attendance: 23,107 . As Southgate stood on the touchline at the final whistle, though, his response to victory muted, it was clear he knew the hard part is around the corner. The away goal Croatia pilfered here through Marko Livaja means they are far from out of this absorbing contest. Having breezed through the group stage, rattling up eight straight wins and scoring goals almost at will, England were always going to find this contest a significant step up. Croatia arrived with a blemish-free away record in qualifying and they caused trouble right away, so much so that in the 13th minute Southgate’s side fell behind for the first time in a game since September last year. It was a cheap goal, too, as an inswinging corner was glanced on by Niko Datkovic to Livaja, who headed past Jack Butland from six yards. This posed a test of England’s character but their response was spirited. Luke Shaw was heavily involved and he came closest to restoring parity before half-time when he danced between two opponents before cracking a drive against a post. Nathan Redmond also threatened, while Liam Moore should have done better. Croatia still exuded menace on the break. Each time England were caught upfield, blue shirts swept forward, intent on inflicting a killer blow. There was one lucky escape in the 36th minute when Ante Coric fired wide with the goal at his mercy but England, who were watched by a host of the FA’s top brass including chairman Greg Dyke and head coach Roy Hodgson, were able to get to half-time and regroup. Southgate’s words clearly had an effect as England began the second period with greater purpose. Their passing had more zip and they began asking questions of Croatia, trying to stretch the play and get behind the visiting defence whenever they could. Harry Kane's equaliser brought England level just before the hour mark at Molineux in the Euro 2015 playoff first-leg against Croatia . Kane spreads his arms wide in celebration after scoring the equaliser for England U21s at Molineux on Friday night . Manchester United defender Luke Shaw (left) celebrates with Kane after the latter scores for England U21 against Croatia U21 . Soon they got their reward. After conceding a corner, Croatia failed to clear their lines and the ball arrived at the feet of Berahino. Up to that point, the West Bromwich forward had been quiet but he found a yard to put in an inviting cross and Kane did the rest, stooping to head in at the near post. Kane has made impressive strides in the last 12 months — it was a year to the day since he scored a hat-trick in a 4-0 rout of San Marino — and he has now found the net in each of his last three England appearances. His intervention could not have been better timed as it lifted the home crowd and gave England the impetus to chase victory. They got their rewards in the 85th minute when Berahino was upended by keeper Dominik Livakovic. Berahino kept his nerve, thumping home from 12 yards. The question is whether England can finish the job in the Balkans. Berahino (right) and Nathan Redmond (left) celebrate after the former scores from the penalty spot late on in the match .

"Gareth Southgate has raised the bar for his England Under 21 squad by challenging them to secure a Euro 2015 spot with style. England will face their biggest test of Southgate’s reign in Wolverhampton on Friday night, when they face Croatia in the first leg of their play-off meeting. If England can negotiate Friday night's contest, plus the return leg in Vincovki next Tuesday, they will set a record of being the only nation to reach five consecutive Under 21 European Championships. But just getting there is not enough for Southgate. England Under 21 manager Gareth Southgate watches his players during a training session at St George's Park . Saido Berahino (right) with Tom Ince during international training in Burton-upon-Trent on Thursday . He has spent the last 14 months working on a distinct pattern of play, based around passing and movement, and the coach does not want to see those principles abandoned, even on a pressurised occasion. ‘I think they will look forward to it,’ said Southgate, who on Thursday night sent Carl Jenkinson back to West Ham after the right-back failed to recover from a hamstring injury. ‘People have enjoyed watching us and there’s a big crowd wherever we’ve played. We’ve been an exciting attacking team to watch. We play a possession-based game, we averaged over 600 passes per game in the group, so we’ve got to continue to do that. That’s the style we want to keep playing in. ‘I’ve set the bar high for them. It’s not enough just to win, I want them to win with a style that will make them successful to take them to the seniors. If I’m making it harder for them, so be it. That’s the benchmark I want to set.’ Gareth Southgate has challenged his squad to secure a Euro 2015 spot with style . The former Middlesbrough manager sees his side face Croatia in Wolverhampton on Friday night . Though England are without key midfielders James Ward-Prowse and Nathaniel Chalobah, through injury, Saido Berahino gives them class up front. Southgate is thrilled with the progress of the 21-year-old, who has scored six times this season for West Brom. ‘I would hope that in an England shirt, Saido will get a suitable reception and the fans at Wolves get behind him,’ he said. ‘Then when he comes back with West Brom they hammer him like they should! I hope the local fans will be able to put their club allegiance to one side just for one night. ‘I had to have a chat with him at the end of last year, but we’ve worked quite closely together. At times when he has needed a bit of encouragement and advice we have talked regularly and I am delighted with how he has started the season. ‘We always try to work alongside the clubs in terms of player development and give the right messages to the players to keep working at their game. At the moment Saido is reaping the rewards of that.’ Southampton's Ward-Prowseis ruled out of Friday evening's match because of an injury .","England Under 21 face Croatia in Wolverhampton on Friday night .

"Gareth Southgate has urged his players not to make the same mistake as Ben Flower and let indiscipline ruin their chances of reaching Euro 2015. Southgate has made a point of telling his young squad since they arrived in Vinkovci about the perils of losing their cool in what will be an intense atmosphere and he has used the example of the Wigan prop Flower, who was sent off for punching St Helens' Lance Hohaia in the Grand Final at Old Trafford on Saturday night. England are braced for Croatia using intimidatory tactics in the second leg, which they trail 2-1, and Southgate does not want to see indiscipline ruin all the good work they have done to get into this position over the last 13 months.

The Rugby League on Saturday was a classic example why. 'You have to rise to the challenge physically – we are not here to be pushed over – but you have to keep a cool head.

"A significant anniversary is approaching in Gareth Southgate’s career but there will be no cause for celebration. For England’s Under 21 head coach, October 20, 2009 is never too far from his thoughts. It was the date he was sacked by Middlesbrough and a glance at the calendar is a reminder of how swiftly and brutally someone’s life in football can be turned upside down. Southgate remembers that night with clarity. It started with Middlesbrough moving to a point off the top of the Championship with a slick 2-0 win over Derby but began unravelling when he walked into the boardroom and saw the look on Steve Gibson’s face. Then realisation dawned. England's Under 21 manager Gareth Southgate says leaving Middlesbrough helped his career take off . How England's U21 team could line-up on Tuesday . Yet as he revisits the episode during England’s preparations for the second leg of their European Championship play-off with Croatia, there is no bitterness or anger. While it may have been one of the worst things to happen to him, he knows the best came out of it. ‘Look, no question: losing your job is something that will affect anyone’s confidence,’ said Southgate, whose side will defend a 2-1 lead on Tuesday night. ‘Anyone who has been through that — no matter what you earn or what you have achieved in your life — it is a blow to the ego. ‘But in hindsight, it gave me the chance to learn and strengthen myself in areas of coaching where I needed more knowledge: management, leadership. It is different from leadership on the field as you are leading an organisation when you manage a club. You are hardened by the experience. ‘I think I am a coach who has empathy with his players but I’m less worried whether they are upset and disappointed, as I’ve seen the impact of relegation on a club — having to make staff redundant and make decisions that affected the livelihood of good friends. That toughens you up quite a bit.’ At first, it was difficult to adjust. He confesses to ‘getting under my wife’s feet’ and trying to find solace at his local gym, where he found himself becoming a regular at coffee mornings with the local pensioners. He expressed an interest in some jobs in the Championship, only for no interviews to be forthcoming. It was then Southgate realised the only way he would get back into the game was with education. Soon enough, doors started to open. Southgate lets out a roar as Middlesbrough manager when they equalised against West Ham in May 2009 . Southgate on being sacked: 'It gave me the chance to learn and strengthen myself in areas of coaching' Southgate admits it was difficult to adjust but is glad he managed to get back on his feet with England's U21s . ‘I worked with ITV, which got me access to some great matches and back involved studying football,’ said Southgate. ‘Then I got the call from Sir Trevor Brooking to come and work here, three-and-a-half years ago, which gave me a real insight into youth development in this country. ‘I think he knew I want the best for English football and wanted to maintain the standards that he had. ‘I see a lot of my mates out of work or losing their jobs and it’s a reminder that if you are doing something you believe in and it’s something that you really enjoy, that is a lucky place to be.’ Southgate got a call from Sir Trevor Brooking to  work for England's U21 squad three-and-a-half years ago . He is 13 months into a three-year contract as Under 21 head coach and it is clear Southgate has had an influence. The way England came back in Wolverhampton against Croatia on Friday night was proof his methods are working. England’s novices kept playing and pressing, never panicking. They approached the task in the same calm way as the man who has taken them to the brink of Euro 2015. It is why he will offer perspective if they ultimately fall short. ‘I’d just like the players and staff to progress,’ he said. ‘I think when you have been through what I have as an individual, first of all in 1996, then again with losing the job at Middlesbrough — having had to manage in the Premier League with no experience at 35 — you can cope with anything.

"Nathan Redmond is ready to lead the England Under-21s push for Euro 2015 after being toughened up by the rough and tumble of life in the Championship. The Norwich City winger will be a key player when Gareth Southgate’s squad go head-to-head over two legs with Croatia for a place in the Czech Republic, starting at Molineux. Redmond, 20, has been thriving at Norwich and insists he has no regrets after seeing moves to Stoke or West Ham fail to materialise in the summer, as he says the experience of life outside the Barclays Premier League has been invaluable to his development. Nathan Redmond said life in the Championship means he has gotten used to being roughed up on the pitch . ‘I’m finding myself with four men on me at times,’ says Redmond. ‘I expect to be targeted during games or getting a kick every now and then. It’s toughened me up a bit. I can accept a bit of a kick or a nudge in the back now. ‘It helps when we go away to places like Moldova (last month) as you know what’s coming from the foreign players, who like to stamp on your toes or elbow in the back.’ Redmond is accustomed to rough treatment from his early days at Birmingham City. ‘I was only 15 and getting rattled about by Roger Johnson and Stephen Carr,’ he recalls. ‘There was Barry Ferguson and Lee Bowyer too. It was a scary group really. I’d be running over to training and think ‘‘Oh no. . .’’ Gareth Southgate's side will face Croatia in a play-off to reach the Under 21 European Championships in 2015 . ‘Stephen Carr would smash me from the first minute and said he wouldn’t stop until I learned to deal with it...I haven’t had it easy but it has really helped.’ Redmond has become a fixture in the side under Southgate and says there is a desire among the group not to let a run of nine wins from 10 games in the group stages go to waste. ‘Playing for your country is a big honour for everyone involved, so it’s spurred us on,’ says Redmond. ‘Now I want to qualify for these finals and come up against some of the best teams and win it.’ Redmond joined Norwich from Birmingham when the Canaries were in the Premier League .

"In Steven Gerrard’s dreams, Wednesday night ends with him celebrating like it is 2009. Liverpool blow Real Madrid away, their stuttering season catches fire and more memories are created to last a lifetime. His nightmares, however, involve an embarrassment, of Liverpool finding themselves on the receiving end of a scoreline similar to the 4-0 drubbing they administered to Real, when these teams last collided five years ago. The first scenario, he believes, is possible, particularly if Brendan Rodgers’ side are swept along on a wave of emotion. If Liverpool use the energy that a highly-charged Anfield crowd will give them, Gerrard hopes they can swarm all over Los Blancos. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Liverpool host Real in European epic .

But the second picture, Gerrard recognises, is also possible, especially if one member of Liverpool’s starting line-up approaches this contest with the mindset that they can coast through 90 minutes, not pushing themselves to the limit. For Liverpool to defy the odds, no passengers are permitted. ‘That applies to me personally as well,’ Gerrard said. ‘Everyone who is picked to play — from the 11 in the starting line-up to the subs on the bench — everyone has to be on their game. We are playing against the best side in Europe and if we have two or three passengers, we get beat convincingly. ‘It can become embarrassing against sides like this who are deadly away from home on the counter-attack. We need to be right on it. But when big questions get asked of this team — especially last year when big hitters came to town — we raised our game. ‘The fans raised their game, we raised ours and put in some really good performances. I think a (big) performance is due now. QPR wasn’t good enough, everyone knows that, but everyone will respect that when Real Madrid come into town it’s a different game to get up for. ‘Every player in the dressing room realises we can’t have any passengers or we will get beat convincingly. I can understand that (many people are predicting a Madrid win). Most places they go, with the current players and the form they are in, they are expected to win most games they play. ‘I understand those opinions but shocks are there, upsets happen. Yes, we understand we are the underdogs but with the atmosphere we have here and the players raising their game for a night like this, I think it is possible to cause an upset.’ Gerrard  celebrates scoring his team's third goal during the Champions League win against Real Madrid in 2009 . Gerrard hopes Liverpool can recreate another magical night like the one in 2009 against Real at Anfield . Liverpool best beware of Real star Cristiano Ronaldo . Given the way Liverpool played at Loftus Road on Sunday, many would find it difficult to see why the captain has such optimism. Liverpool’s play has been scruffy and inconsistent this season and logic dictates that it should be no different, especially against a side of Madrid’s undoubted class. But this, remember, is Anfield on a European night. This is the stadium where logic is often defied on such occasions, when the improbable has been made possible. Gerrard has been a key protagonist in the drama since the turn of this century, not least on March 10, 2009. ‘Looking back at the game, the reason we came out on top was because we were aggressive with and without the ball,’ said Gerrard, who scored two of Liverpool’s four goals. ‘We pressed from the front and had a world-class talent in (Fernando) Torres and we forced them into mistakes. I can’t give away tactics but with due respect to the team in 2009 individually Real Madrid have improved so we have huge respect for their current team. ‘We need to enjoy the game but you only enjoy games like this when you play as a team. We’re looking to shock a few people.’ There were times during a five-year absence from the Champions League when Gerrard admitted to being consumed with envy towards those who had taken Liverpool’s place and it is why he makes a point of re-emphasising this is not simply an occasion to enjoy. ‘I think all the hard work Brendan has done and the lads have done (means) we deserve nights like these,’ said Gerrard, for whom this will be a 127th European appearance. ‘I just hope no-one from the outside thinks we are just going into these games to enjoy ourselves. I hope nobody thinks we are settling for being in the Champions League. ‘Madrid are top opposition and probably the best side in Europe but we want to give a good account of ourselves. This is a great opportunity for us to put in a really strong performance.’ It is time, then, for Liverpool to prove that the spellbinding play of last season was not a flash in the pan. They might be comparative novices in this competition but, as 34-year-old Gerrard points out, that will count for nothing when the whistle blows. Gerrard and manager Brendan Rodgers spoke to the press ahead of Liverpool's clash with Real Madrid . Arsenal's new striker Danny Welbeck sent Steven Gerrard a message on Instagram ahead of Real Madrid's visit, writing: 'Good luck for tomorrow!' ‘I don’t think any of us expect a year’s leeway,’ said Gerrard. ‘In the time I’ve been here I have never experienced supporters saying “oh it is just nice to be in Champions League; it doesn’t matter how you do, you will get judged next year”. ‘We will get judged against the best side in Europe. The message to the players is simple: we need a performance. ‘I am pretty confident that we can surprise a few people but that is how I am. I go into games with optimism, rather than fearing individuals and the opposition.’ His team-mates must follow suit if Gerrard’s dream is to come true.

"Professional footballers take a lot of stick for their apparent lack of intelligence, but Roy Hodgson is keen to get his players away from that stereotype as he regularly tests them on their general knowledge.

"CLICK HERE to read Neil Ashton's match report from the St Jakob Stadium . Mario Balotelli  had just received a pass from Raheem Sterling and, as he took possession, Lazar Markovic began scampering down the flank. To get Liverpool firmly on the front foot, all Balotelli had to do was take control and usher the ball out wide. Instead, he dithered. The Italian tried to run through the middle on his own but the ball became stuck between his feet and Basle defender Fabian Schar comfortably dispossessed him. On the touchline, Brendan Rodgers went berserk. Flinging his arms out, hollering at Balotelli and asking for an explanation as to why a promising attack had so needlessly fallen down, he left his new £16million striker aware of his displeasure. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers (C) raises his arms in frustration as a Liverpool move breaks down . Mario Balotelli was a target for his manager's anger during the Champions League group A defeat . Rodgers was left frustrated by Liverpool's failure to reach the standards they set last season . Yet this was not an isolated incident. Moments later, when Philippe Coutinho dithered and surrendered the ball, Rodgers again let rip, leaving the Brazilian with no ambiguity over how disappointed he was to see another break go askew. It became a recurring theme. Tugging at the jacket of his black suit, folding his arms firmly and shuffling from side to side, Rodgers’ frustration at watching Liverpool fail to get near the breathless standards they set last season became more apparent with each passing second in St Jakob Park. Having masterminded one of the most exciting campaigns in the club’s recent history, Rodgers is impatient for his new look team to reach the levels that saw them pummel opponents to submission before they even realised what was happening. ‘We’ve not made as good a start as we would have wanted but there are a number of reasons why,’ Rodgers had explained when arriving in Basle on Tuesday. ‘We are integrating new players to a new culture and we’ve had injuries to key players. We have a big vision and an idea where we are going.’ Rodgers barks orders at defender Jose Enrique as Liverpool's defence struggles yet again . Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard (C) looks over to Rodgers as the team struggle to find their fluency . Rodgers cut an agitated figure from the sidelines as he watched his game plan fail against the Swiss . Much to his consternation, however, it is not happening how he wants it to. The rhythm and the swagger is missing from their attack but, most worryingly, the defence continues to be Liverpool’s biggest flaw and the concession of another soft goal prompted Rodgers’ most colourful reaction. After Marco Streller had gleefully pounced on a loose ball in the six-yard area to put Basle in control of the game, Rodgers spun on his heels, scrunched up his face and mouthed his displeasure to his assistants Colin Pascoe and Mike Marsh. Rodgers could contend – just – with Liverpool lacking fluency going forward if things were solid at the back but their inability to keep a clean sheet is becoming more and more problematic and it is going to leave them with mountains to climb, both at home and in Europe. In five of their last six games, they have conceded goals that can be kindly described as cheap and it says everything for the state of flux that Liverpool have only kept one clean sheet in their nine fixtures in all competitions. It is not good enough. Liverpool's defence is still a major cause for concern as they conceded another cheap goal . Basle's Marco Streller wheels away after scoring the match winning goal against Liverpool . Liverpool players trudge off dejectedly after conceding the goal that dents their Champions League hopes . To progress in Europe, teams first and foremost have to be solid and difficult to break down.

Liverpool now face a double-header against Real Madrid, arguably the most dazzling attacking unit in world football, and if they play as they have been, they will be stuck on three points with two games to go, away to Ludogorets (November 26) before hosting Basle on December 9. Tradition demands that Liverpool extricate themselves from difficult positions and their European history is filled with glorious come-from-behind moments. History, though, will not save them this time if Rodgers does not find a cure for his side’s back ache.","Liverpool lost 1-0 to Basle in their Champions League group B clash .

"Brendan Rodgers spoke slowly and quietly to add weight to his words. Mario Balotelli’s name had just been brought into the conversation and Liverpool’s manager had a message to broadcast. ‘I think in terms of goals, he needs to improve,’ Rodgers said. ‘It is as simple as that. Any striker — not just him — is judged on his goals and the number of assists he makes. At this moment, he has not hit the numbers he will have wanted.’ During a day when he had to confront a number of issues, from Daniel Sturridge’s fitness to Liverpool’s soft underbelly, nothing resonated louder in the aftermath of a potentially fatal defeat to Basle than the words that were reserved for the £16million man who arrived from AC Milan. Mario Balotelli reacts during Liverpool's 1-0 Champions League defeat in Basle on Wednesday . Mario Balotelli was frustrated all evening in Switzerland and never had a touch in Basle's box . Whatever honeymoon Balotelli had been enjoying at Liverpool is over after his wretched personal performance in St Jakob-Park, where he barely looked interested and rarely threatened to break into anything more taxing than a canter. One goal so far is not a sufficient return. It would be unfair to dump all that is currently wrong at Liverpool at Balotelli’s door — their problems run deeper than a misfiring centre forward — but his static, stuttering displays are exacerbating the situation and, five weeks into his Liverpool career, he has a decision to make. Is he prepared to put in the hard yards? Is he going to do what Rodgers expects of all his strikers, to hassle and harass defenders to the point of distraction? Will he become the focal point of Liverpool’s team and lead their charge, ramping up the intensity with his runs into channels? Brendan Rodgers and Mario Balotelli in training at Liverpool's Melwood base on Thursday . Steven Gerrard and Mario Balotelli train for Liverpool on Thursday at Melwood . Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers watches his team train on Thursday after returning from Switzerland . None of that looked likely in Basle. Flouncing off the pitch at the final whistle without acknowledging the travelling supporters, he was the only member of Liverpool’s squad to be escorted back to the team coach and the only one to have something else on aside from an official club tracksuit. Aside from a glistening diamond in each ear, Balotelli was wearing an oversized baseball cap, an image that ensured he grabbed attention, but the time has come for him to realise that he has to start making statements on the pitch rather than off it. If Balotelli looks around Liverpool’s dressing room, he will see professionals who live a quiet life, get on with their business conservatively and push themselves to maximise their talent. He has a stage to make a name for himself but, so far, the penny has not fully dropped. ‘In terms of his behaviour since he came into here the boy is consciously trying to work hard at the aspects of the game that we would demand,’ said Rodgers. ‘In terms of the intensity and that work-rate. And over the course of the team that is the same. ‘We need to return to being a team. That has brought us success over the last 18 months. When confidence is a little bit low in the team, it can become more about the individual, but that is not what we are about. We are a team and when we work to that principle we are at our best.’ If that is the case, why did Rodgers sign a player who, as Sportsmail’s Jamie Carragher observed, does not have a history of making sacrifices for the team? How have Liverpool slipped so far when the memory of what Luis Suarez was inspiring last season is still fresh? Mario Balotelli's only goal for Liverpool so far came against Ludogorets at Anfield . Brendan Rodgers looked frustrated on the touchline in Basle at his team's showing . ‘I always said it was about availability and affordability of players,’ Rodgers explained. ‘Mario was the one right at the very end who was available for that. I said when he came in there was a calculated risk and it’s something I have to work on to try to make it work for the team. ‘There are very few players who can replace Suarez. Actually, there are no players who can replace Suarez. When you look at the availability of other players during the summer it was something that was difficult for us.’ Rodgers looked at a number of options when Suarez left for Barcelona, including Loic Remy, Radamel Falcao and Karim Benzema, and believes Liverpool did sign a world-class forward in the last window, but the spotlight is now shining to see whether Balotelli prove he is worthy of that description. Liverpool's talisman Luis Suarez left for Barcelona in the summer in a deal worth £75million . Liverpool signed Divock Origi from Lille in the summer for £10m and loaned him back to the French side . ‘It’s no good now, I know, but we took a player in Divock Origi who we believe will be world-class,’ said Rodgers. ‘We will get him (back from Lille, where he is on loan) next summer. Now he is a top player. He has everything — the speed, the profile and so on. ‘But we couldn’t bring him in now and that was unfortunate because he can run in behind, he can keep the ball, press and run but that was part of the deal. There were very few top-class forwards who were available. Mario was a calculated gamble we had to try and work with.’ If it doesn’t pay off, miserable nights such as the one in Basle could become a recurring theme. Like MailOnline Sport's Facebook page.

"Brendan Rodgers and Steven Gerrard blasted Liverpool for being 'too soft' as their Champions League hopes were plunged into jeopardy. Liverpool were beaten 1-0 by Basle, conceding a poor goal to Marco Streller, and the feeble manner of their performance in St Jakob Park enraged their manager and captain. To add to a miserable night, there was an open show of petulance from Mario Balotelli, who ignored Rodgers’ request to applaud the visiting supporters and stormed straight down the tunnel. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Brendan Rodgers: Mario  is working hard to get scoring . Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard admitted his side were second best in Basle . It was the manner in which they surrendered control of Group B, though, that caused Rodgers and Gerrard most alarm and they slammed the way in which Liverpool, who now face back-to-back games against reigning champions Real Madrid, folded. Gerrard said: 'They wanted it more which is most disappointing. We came for the win and I expected a win so very disappointing. We didn't deserve anything. We were too soft all over the pitch. ‘It hurts to say they wanted it more. We were second best against an ok team. We didn’t show what we did against Everton. We went back to how we have been this season, which wasn’t good enough.’ Basle striker Marco Streller scores the winner against Liverpool on Wednesday night . Basle coach Paulo Sousa celebrates beating Liverpool with goalscorer Marco Streller . Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers let rip at his players after disappointing defeat . Rodgers agreed, saying: ‘It was far too soft – and not for the first time either. We lost contact again (for the goal) and it was a very disappointing one to concede after all the work we’ve done on the training ground. ‘We never not going in the first 25 minutes and gave it away too easy. We grew into it and I thought we created some chances. We were close on couple of occasions but we conceded a soft goal and then it’s difficult.

I don’t think we’re anywhere near where we were technically last year. It’s very important we get back to playing as a team because that’s what we have done over the last 18 months.’ This is the second time Balotelli has ignored Rodgers order to clap the travelling fans but the Northern Irishman attempted to defuse the situation. ‘Mario worked hard, he knows his job is to create and to get into the area,’ said Rodgers. ‘We are working hard on it. I’m not sure if he went back out to say thanks to the fans as I came straight in.’","Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard admitted his side were second best in Basle on Wednesday night .

"Brendan Rodgers sat in Anfield’s trophy room this week and made a statement that had echoes of his first day in June 2012. ‘What people probably don’t get is the pressure of playing for such a big club,’ said Rodgers, attempting to explain Liverpool’s poor form. ‘The weight of the jersey here is heavy for most players. Once you adapt, you become clearer in your thinking.’ Those words struck a chord with Adam Lallana. As one of Liverpool’s marquee summer signings, the £23million fee that brought him from Southampton ensured there would be no gentle settling-in period. Adam Lallana, the  £23m summer signing from Southampton,  has not made an immediate impact at Anfield . Lallana agrees with Reds manager Brendan Rodgers that the Liverpool shirt can weigh heavily on new players . The 26-year-old came to Anfield carrying an injury but looked fit when he came on against West Ham last week . The Kop expects big-money recruits to make an immediate mark and the fact Lallana, having only just recovered from medial ligament damage, was rusty in his first couple of games against Aston Villa and Ludogorets, did not go unnoticed — most notably by the man himself. ‘It is something you can’t quite explain unless you have experienced it,’ said Lallana, 26. ‘There is that difference when you pull on a Liverpool shirt.’ Slowly but surely, Lallana seems to be finding his stride and he made a difference when coming on as a substitute against West Ham and during the 120 minutes he played against Middlesbrough in the Capital One cup. The Liverpool jersey can also be a source of inspiration and that is something Lallana intends to take into Saturday’s Merseyside derby. ‘It (the expectancy) is a great feeling,’ he said. ‘You can see the relationship they (the fans) have with the players here and that is something I hope to build myself. The best way to overcome the expectation and pressure is to just try and enjoy your football. The former Southampton man (right) also got through 120 minutes of action against Middlesbrough on Tuesday . ‘Not for one minute did I think it would be easy, coming to such a big club. You have to work twice as hard and that’s what I am doing. I’m sure the other signings are as well. ‘It’s going to take a bit of adjusting, playing with new players, but I am 100 per cent confident we will be better for it. ‘We have had a tough spell but that brings everyone together. We ground out the result against Middlesbrough and we are going to have to show that side of ourselves at the minute but we will get there. ‘I never visualised it was going to be easy but I want to be tested and I want to do well.’ Such was Lallana’s determination to make a positive impression that he stayed in America with the rest of Liverpool’s touring squad rather than heading home for treatment after being injured during a training session. Lallana made his name at Southampton, who he helped establish as a strong Premier League outfit . Liverpool have lost their last two matches in the Premier League and sit in 11th position . The Reds host Everton on Saturday, and will need to keep the likes of Romelu Lukaku quiet if they are to win . A bigger way to impress, though, would be to shine in a game that still has the power to create heroes. Nothing would kick-start Lallana’s Anfield career than a winning goal against the team he followed as a boy. ‘Everton always seemed to be fighting relegation when I was supporting them,’ says Lallana, whose childhood hero was goalkeeper Neville Southall. ‘I didn’t go to see them a lot because of where we lived (in St Albans) but I seem to remember there were a lot of tears. ‘I know they’ve not won at Anfield for 15 years and hopefully we can go on and get the win we need this time, too. My dad used to support Everton in the (Gary) Lineker days, when they were doing well. So that’s the reason I started following them. ‘Playing for Southampton, (my affinity) became less and less. But this is an appetising fixture, one for the fans. It would be a great game to give us that boost we need. How would I feel if I scored the winner? I can’t quite answer that. It has to happen first!’ Lallana was actually an Everton fan growing up and his favourite player was Neville Southall (centre)","Adam Lallana says playing for Liverpool brings  responsibility and pressure .

"Leighton Baines is recalling the day, while on England duty, that Gary Neville marched unannounced into his hotel room to see what the noise was about. ‘He heard me playing my guitar,’ Baines says. ‘He was only in for two minutes. He picked it up, had a go, put it down and away he went again. He seemed like he could play, I’ll give him that. I think at one point he was really good but he’s got about 14 jobs now, hasn’t he?’ There is a telling smile. No discussion with Baines could ever be complete without the subject of music being broached and the spin-off from him discussing Leonard Cohen’s new album Popular Problems - his record of choice this week - is how he is teaching himself to play the guitar. Everton left-back Leighton Baines is well-known for his love of music and is learning to play guitar . Baines has spent the last seven seasons at Goodison Park and is an integral member of the Everton team . Baines and fellow defender Seamus Coleman are regarded as two of the best full-backs in the Premier League . During the past 12 months, images have been plentiful of Baines heading off to games, either for Everton or England, with his bags in one hand and a guitar casually slung over his shoulders. It has captured attention but this is no expensive fashion accessory. ‘I don’t get the chance to play at home,’ Baines explains. ‘I try to sneak 20 minutes but when the kids are around, well, you know what it’s like… I haven’t been doing it that long. When we travel, a lot of the lads just sleep, chill out and relax. I’m not a sleeper though. ‘I’m not good with time, really. So it made sense. It was something I was always intrigued about so I just started taking it with me. ‘I’ve had a couple of lessons in Crosby but I’ve been using the internet. I’ve not called in anyone famous… I wouldn’t dare!’ Baines was seen carrying his guitar whilst on duty for England in both in America and Brazil this summer . Baines, pictured with Arctic Monkeys frontman Alex Turner and Miles Kane, attended Glastonbury last year . So what reaction does he get from his Everton and England team-mates who would be more au fait with PlayStations or an Xbox? ‘To be honest, nobody says anything,’ Baines replies. ‘I thought I might get a bit of stick, as daft as that might sound. You know what the environment is like but they just accepted it. I imagine if someone else had done it, there would have been a bit of stick flying around but they just left me to it.’ This is not a run-of-the-mill conversation but, then again, Baines is not your average footballer. He will not, for instance, spend hours watching Sky Sports, preferring instead to bury his head in a book - he is currently reading The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle by the Japanese author Haruki Murakami. But he needs to keep occupied and, during our time together, the issue arises of what happens when his playing career is over. That won’t happen any time soon - he is 29 and committed himself to Everton for five more years in January - but he has thought about the future. Will it involve football? Left back Baines, not your average footballer, prefers to read rather than spend hours watching Sky Sports . ‘I hope not,’ comes the refreshing answer. ‘As much as I love it - the reason I don’t watch or read about it now is because I am giving everything I can to it - any bits of time that are my own, I come away from it. ‘So when I finish, I think I will get that passion back as I won’t be involved in it. I reckon I would go back as a fan but I’d like to do something else. I just want to try a different world, with different people, different experiences. ‘It’s not that I’m not grateful for what I do now, I just want to try to do something different. I have always been thinking about the next move because it wouldn’t be good for me not to have a job or not have to get up to do something.’ Baines is Everton's set-piece specialist and often hits the back of the net from the penalty spot for the Blues . The Everton left-back coolly slots the ball home during the Toffees' 4-1 Europa League win over Wolfsburg . Why? ‘Killing time at home is easy, isn’t it?’ he says. ‘You get a coffee, you have a read, you do the school run. By the time 9pm comes, you have an hour to unwind and then you conk out. That’s easy. The scary bit will come when the football stops, the kids are grown up and they don’t rely on you. ‘I’m aware that when I stop playing, I’m going to have to roll into something else. It wouldn’t be healthy for the alarm to go off and not have something to do.’ Baines admits 'it wouldn't be healthy to not have something to do' when his playing career is over . Honesty is one of Baines’s virtues. He will not duck a question, so when talk turns back to how he viewed events in Brazil - as England’s World Cup campaign ran aground inside six days, Baines found himself in the firing line - he does not offer excuses. ‘I’ve touched on it a few times,’ says a man who now has 28 caps. ‘We shouldn’t still be dwelling on it at this point. Of course it was hugely disappointing the way that it went but you still reflect on it. ‘Everyone came home hurting but you go away, you have your holiday and try to move on. For me, it was spending time with people who meant more to me than football - my family. I went away to Turkey with my mum and dad, sister, my wife and three kids. Baines spent time on holiday with his family following England's disappointing World Cup campaign . ‘You do still go back and think about it because it was so disappointing. Of course, you understand the criticism.’ The ability to apply perspective is crucial, particularly during weeks such as this. Everton’s season has not gone according to plan so far and two defeats in the space of 72 hours - at home in the League against Crystal Palace and then knocked out of the Capital One Cup by Swansea - have left supporters anxious ahead of Saturday’s derby. Yet Baines remains positive, extolling his manager Roberto Martinez’s blueprint. Everton lost to Crystal Palace at home on Sunday despite Baines scoring from the spot late on in the game . ‘He keeps us thinking,’ Baines says. ‘You have got to be a thinking footballer and understand what he wants from you. There is no position that is played in the traditional, conventional way. ‘I think it’s that thing of always trying to find something new, another aspect to your game. He has talked about using me in different positions (Martinez feels Baines has the class to play as a holding midfielder) and something like that keeps you on your toes.’ He will certainly be on his toes at 12.45pm on Saturday as Everton seek to avenge last season’s chastening 4-0 defeat at Anfield. Baines, set to makes his 288th club appearance, hopes the time has arrived for a first success behind enemy lines. Baines and the rest of the Everton team will be hoping for victory against Liverpool at Anfield on Saturday .

"Phil Jagielka will not turn his back on England after insisting he is ready to battle to reclaim his place in Roy Hodgson’s line-up. Everton’s captain was scrutinised after England tumbled out of the World Cup and Hodgson looked at different defensive options during the recent games against Norway and Switzerland, though he did put Jagielka to close out a victory in Basel. Jagielka has not looked to have talks with Hodgson about where he stands in the squad but he does accept that, on recent evidence, he has fallen behind Phil Jones and Chris Smalling in the pecking order to be Gary Cahill’s partner. Phil Jagielka (right) will not turn his back on England and insists he is ready to battle to reclaim his place . Jagielka talks to goalkeeper Tim Howard as Everton thrashed Wolfsburg in Europe on Thursday night . That, however, is not going to be a signal for him to end his career after winning 30 caps. Though he admitted the fallout from the World Cup was a difficult experience, Jagielka maintains his confidence has not been affected and is aiming to show Hodgson he can play a role going forward. ‘There is no point beating myself up about things,’ said Jagielka. ‘I want to play in winning teams and be a big part of a winning team, so there were some aspects I needed to sort out for myself. There are periods of a career where you feel you cannot do too much right. ‘After the game against Switzerland I was as happy as anyone else. I have not pushed my career as far as I can to get to the highest level just to spit my dummy out and say ‘I’m not going to come just because you’re not playing me’. I would like to play every game and play a big part of it. ‘It doesn’t feel nice (being dropped by England). That is the easiest way of saying it, but the manager has a job to do. If you look at building for the future that can work against me, but if you start looking too deeply at things it is not going to do me any favours. ‘I’m not going to demand reasons for not playing. What is there for me to speak to (Hodgson) about? A lot of people could do that for England. That is not what it is about. We are part of a team and if the manager makes a decision you stick by it. All I can do is my best.’ Gary Cahill (left) is England's premier central defender with Phil Jones preferred as his partner at the back . Before this season began, Jagielka said he would “not know for a month” whether the World Cup had left a scar. If his initial displays were scratchy – Everton conceded 10 times in their opening three games – his last two performances against West Brom and Wolfsburg have been much better. ‘I do not feel it has (left a mark),’ said Jagielka, whose side face Crystal Palace tomorrow. ‘It is an obvious assumption to make because it has not been great and could have been a lot better since. On a personal level I do not go around shouting about things. ‘I am sure I would not have been asked this if we had won the first three games of the season and kept clean sheets. I know I have to answer these questions. It has been a sticky four months but the players and coaching staff (at Everton) have been brilliant. ‘I do not think I have been horrific but when you look at the results I have been part of you can throw criticism my way and it is something I have to deal with.’","Everton captain Phil Jagielka was scrutinised after the World Cup .

"Simon Mignolet's Liverpool place may be coming under scrutiny but the goalkeeper is quick to pounce on suggestions he is feeling the pressure. ‘What is pressure? Pressure is what is happening in Iraq at the moment where there is a war. That is pressure,’ says the Belgian. Liverpool striker Simon Mignolet says he doesn't fear for his spot at Anfield . Simon Mignolet has conceded 12 goals in eight games for Liverpool this season . ‘If I have to look into all the people and players who are linked with Liverpool football club then there will be another team on the pitch. Every week there would be a different 11 playing. ‘So it is just the fact that you play for a big club and you have to accept that is the way it is, but I don’t read anything into that.

"The Luzhniki Stadium, May 21, 2008: as Chelsea and Manchester United’s players are hit by a wall of sound as they emerge for the Champions League final, a young coach is dreaming. All around, flashbulbs are popping as cameras capture images of the players who are about to contest the greatest game in club football. Gleaming on a platform in the distance is that unmistakable trophy, the one that defines careers. At that moment, Brendan Rodgers — youth coach under Chelsea manager Avram Grant — knew his life’s ambition. Brendan Rodgers talks to the media ahead of his debut as a Champions League manager on Tuesday night . ‘I remember walking out of the tunnel when the teams were coming out,’ says Liverpool’s manager. ‘I was behind them and I was picturing myself as the manager in a Champions League final. I was wondering what it might be like. ‘With all the experiences of games in that period, they all helped me because in my mind I was looking at the game and making decisions as a manager. To arrive and be at that level is great. John Terry shows his agony after missing a penalty in the 2008 Champions League final shootout . Cristiano Ronaldo and Sir Alex Ferguson celebrate Manchester United's victory over Chelsea in Moscow . ‘When we were walking out in Moscow, I was framing the mindset that one day — if this was to happen to me — then I will have been here before. Hopefully, it is something that becomes real.’ Rodgers is not suggesting that he envisages that dream coming true in Berlin’s Olympic Stadium next June but, for now, to lead Liverpool in the competition after a five-year absence is a step in the right direction. When he arrived at Anfield two years ago, Rodgers’ mission was to get Liverpool back in the Champions League but it is only in the past two days, as he prepared for Tuesday night’s tussle with Bulgaria’s FC Ludogorets, that he has truly appreciated the significance. This, after all, is the tournament that enchants the five-time winners like no other. The Kop sings about Rome, Wembley, Paris and Istanbul at every home game and they gleefully recall games against Inter Milan (1965), St Etienne (1977) and Chelsea (2005) that span generations. History, however, needs updating and Rodgers sees this as a chance for his young squad to start writing their own chapter. With European champions Real Madrid also in Group B, another famous Anfield night may be just around the corner. ‘It hits home as soon as you actually see ourselves back in the Champions League how much it can actually be missed,’ says Rodgers. ‘I looked at the footballs (with the Champions League logos) at Melwood the other day. Little simple touches like that let you know this is where this club has to be. ‘It’s something I have really wanted to experience as a coach. At 41 — to be able to get the chance — it’s really young but it’s something I’m looking forward to.’ Croatian defender Dejan Lovren talks to the press alongside Rodgers on Monday . Rodgers is likely to keep faith with the vast majority of the side that lost 1-0 to Aston Villa on Saturday, meaning the midfield axis will be Steven Gerrard and Jordan Henderson — captain alongside vice-captain. Henderson has been elevated to this position as reward for the progress he has made since Rodgers has been at the club. As Henderson prepares to take another significant step forward, Rodgers believes the same is true of Liverpool as a club. ‘Jordan is someone who represents a lot of what we are about,’ said Rodgers. Jordan Henderson (left) has emerged as a key player for Liverpool under Brendan Rodgers . ‘He and Stevie are the moral compass of our group: how they conduct themselves on and off the field, how they train, how they work. ‘You see now for club and country he (Henderson) holds himself really well, he’s got a great stature and I think he will be around here for years to come.’ Sentiments which Rodgers hopes will be true of Liverpool in the Champions League.","Liverpool return to Champions League for first time in five years .

"Big occasions at Anfield always mean The Kop is fully decorated and Liverpool's return to Champions League combat was no exception. From the banner that was unfurled shortly before the teams emerged before kick-off declaring, in bold red lettering, 'We Are Liverpool' to the image of Brendan Rodgers simply proclaiming 'Boss', there were nods to the characters that have shaped the club's history. Hanging in the far corner of one of football's most famous stands, however, another took the eye. First given an airing during Saturday's limp 1-0 defeat against Aston Villa, this flag had a profound message in Italian about one of the current squad. 'Non ho nulla di dichiarare tranne il mio genio,' were the stated words next to a picture of Mario Balotelli. Liverpool fans unfurl a banner dedicated to their latest hero Mario Balotelli . Balotelli began paying back his £16m investment by opening the scoring with his first goal for Liverpool . Balotelli celebrates opening the scoring after Liverpool finally broke the deadlock in the second half . The Italy international has the chance to become an Anfield legend, according to Steven Gerrard . Translated, you will discover it is one of Oscar Wilde's most famous quotations, 'I have nothing to declare except my genius'. No matter that he had yet to complete 90 minutes for Liverpool, here was evidence of how swiftly Balotelli has been welcomed. Liverpool supporters are desperate for him to succeed. With memories of Luis Suarez beginning to fade, there is a position for someone to come in and make themselves the new darling of this ground and Steven Gerrard explained the opening that is there for Balotelli. 'I hope he goes for it because it will be the making of him,' Gerrard said recently. I' have told him that. It was the first conversation I had with him. I told him 'Mario, it's there for you'. I told him to think of the names that have gone before and how he can uphold the tradition of top strikers here. 'We either produce them or find them. This is his chance. If I was in his position, at 24 years of age, I'd go and grab it with both hands. I'd sacrifice everything I could to grab it. If I was him I'd think 'I want to goals, medals, big European night from my Liverpool career'. It's all there for him.' Liverpool fans enjoyed their return to the Champions League after a five-year absence from the competition . Captain Steven Gerrard saved Liverpool's blushes with a late penalty to earn a 2-1 victory . Balotelli seized the opportunity of leading Liverpool's line in the absence of the injured Daniel Sturridge . Match winners Gerrard (R) and Balotelli congratulate each other after securing a vital first win . That may be so but, before this game, his career on Merseyside has yet to take flight. If there was some initial promise in the 3-0 win at Tottenham, there was a stall against Aston Villa. Having been ill in the build-up, he was substituted after a limp display. What, then, would he follow up with? With Anfield expecting to take advantage of their most inviting assignment of Group B – a home date against Bulgarian novices – Balotelli had a gilt-edged opportunity to start repaying the faith Brendan Rodgers has shown in him. Much like his team, though, he found it hard to get going. His first significant passage of play was a run away from goal in the 13th minute but he couldn't find the space to shoot, as two Ludogrets defenders swarmed all over him. A first sight of goal arrived a few moments later but Aleksander Aleksandrov was alert and thundered in with a challenge to divert his shot. Similar frustration followed in the 34th minute when, after creating an opening, a right-footed drive was comfortably gathered by Milan Borjan. He jogged around and tried to get involved. He shouted at the match officials when things never went his way but there was never the feeling that Balotelli, a Champions League winner in his youth with Inter Milan, was waiting to cast a spell in front of goal. Then it all changed. Just as nerves were beginning to fray and Ludogrets started to sense an improbable result, Balotelli did what all the A-list performers do and came up with the goal to crack the tension. It was a fine finish too, showing poise under pressure. How his new crowd loved it, serenading him with the song 'Mario fantastico! Mario Magnifico! Ole, ole! Ole, ole!' If much of what had gone before was unconvincing, it no longer mattered. Balotelli was up and running. Kop fans are primed for a new goal scoring hero after the departure of Luis Suarez to Barcelona . Balotelli (R) was guilty of missing several chances before finally finding the net at his new club . Liverpool teammates prove what a popular figure Balotelli is after his strike gave them the lead . A word of warning, though: for him to really become a success, he must work. He has to cover ground and make himself a nuisance and realise it is demanded that a Liverpool forward run himself to a standstill. All the greats did it. They all knew that hard work was a prerequisite. The system Rodgers plays demands a high tempo and for his players to press. That is when they are at the best and when the chances come. If nobody is doing that up front, the system fragments and Liverpool's potency suffers. Balotelli has the stage and the banner in homage to him on The Kop shows how much the locals want him to succeed. The big question is how much Balotelli wants to make it happen.

"Roberto Martinez insists he is under no pressure to fit John Stones into Everton’s team following his promotion to the England starting line-up.

You see him perform in the way he did against Norway but then, even with the pressure the England team have in their first qualifier, he is impressive.’ Martinez, whose side face West Brom on Saturday, added: ‘John is a young man and I’m going to measure his playing time because he is still developing as a young player and needs help in that respect. ‘It helps when you see John going with England and playing as he did. That will always bring a success to our team. It’s not about playing every game, it’s about what the players need, and I do feel John will have a massive role this season with us.’","Roberto Martinez insists he is under no pressure to start John Stones .

"There was almost complete silence in the courtroom as Oscar Pistorius was sentenced to five years in jail for the manslaughter of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. Former Olympic athlete Pistorius remained stoic as Judge Masipa read out the sentence, which additionally included a three-year suspended sentence for discharging a firearm. It was, Masipa remarked, ‘fair and just.’ Steenkamps’ parents Barry and June sobbed quietly as Pistorius was given his punishment for shooting their daughter to death through a closed bathroom door. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Oscar Pistorius jailed for five years . Oscar Pistorius stands in court as he is sentenced to five years in jail for culpable homicide . Pistorius greets his uncle Arnold Pistorius, right, and other family members as he is led out of court . Judge Thokozile Masipa delivered the verdict at the High Court in Pretoria in September . Pistorius’ defence lawyer Gerrie Nel seemed content with the sentence. ‘The court has done what it had to do,’ he said, indicating there will be no appeal from the defence. Pistorius had previously been cleared of the more serious premeditated and unplanned murder charges after a seven-month trial. The 27-year-old closed his eyes and grabbed the hands of his uncle Arnold and sister Aimee as he was led down to the cells to begin his sentence for culpable homicide, the South African equivalent of manslaughter. The contrast between this broken man and the inspirational athlete who soared to worldwide fame as he overcame extreme disability to compete on the biggest stage was stark. His career is in tatters. It is unlikely he will ever compete in a significant athletics meet again. His house and most of the millions he earned in lucrative sponsorship deals are gone, hundreds of thousands spent on his defence team for this trial.

Since the death of Steenkamp on Valentine’s Day, 2013, the world has watched breathlessly as the unravelling of Pistorius’s life has been played out in the media and before a Pretoria courtroom. Steenkamp, a law graduate and successful model who was just 29 when she was killed by a man she had been dating for three months is the only true victim of this crime. But Pistorius’s fall from grace has been sensational. Born without fibulas, the outer of the bones that run between the knee and the ankle, Pistorius’s legs were amputated below the knee when he was 11 months old. His parents insisted he was allowed to go to a normal school and at Constantina Kloof Primary School he ran, swam, played rugby and football like all the children. He overcame further tragedy when his beloved mother Shiela died when he was 15 and was already boarding at Pretoria Boys School when he was thrust into the international spotlight at the Athens Paralympics in 2004.

A South African magazine voted him the country’s sexiest celebrity in 2012. Pistorius was also preoccupied by guns and speed, firing his weapon in a crowded restaurant and injuring his friend Kevin Lerena, a professional boxer. This trial and punishment has lifted the lid on the private life of an iconic figure. It has been dramatic and captivating but ultimately desperately sad.","Oscar Pistorius sentenced to five years in jail for the manslaughter of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp .

"Diafra Sakho wants to be West Ham’s version of Didier Drogba and believes the Premier League is in desperate need of more players like the Chelsea striker. The Senegalese forward is on fire with five goals in his last five games since his £4.5million move from Metz in the summer.

On Tuesday night, the midfielder demonstrated the quick feet and smart football brain that saw him compared to Paul Gascgoine as he was emerging on the scene. Still got it: Morrison, who scored this brilliant goal last season, showed on Tuesday he can still have a role . His brilliant strike on 35 minutes would have opened the scoring were it not for an excellent save by United keeper Mark Howard. Just seconds later Morrison darted into the box, wrong footing his man but the good work was undone when he feigned being brought down and was booked for diving by referee James Linington. Morrison began the passing move that led to the West Ham goal. He passed out wide for Reece Burke, whose cross was headed into the far bottom corner of the net by Diafra Sakho. He was taken off and replaced by club veteran Mark Noble eight minutes into extra time. Morrison applauded the fans who cheered him in response.

"Manchester City face a daunting trip to the Allianz Arena to face Bundesliga winners Bayern Munich on Wednesday night in their opening Champions League encounter. The two sides have been drawn in the same group together for the third time in four seasons, meaning this is their fifth encounter since September 2011. Here, Sportsmail looks at how the two side's likely starting line-ups compare... BAYERN MUNICH . MANUEL NEUER - 9 . The sweeper keeper is the best in the world. He takes strong command of his area and it usually takes something special to beat him. German World Cup-winning goalkeeper Manuel Neuer will hope to keep a clean sheet against Manchester City . DAVID ALABA - 7.5 . Young Austrian has recovered from being elbowed in the face by Zlatan Ibrahimovic on international duty. Poses danger going forward. David Alaba is likely to form part of a Bayern back three against Manchester City at the Allianz Arena . JEROME BOATENG - 8 . Pacey defender who rarely misplaces a pass. Vastly improved from the player he was at the Etihad. Jerome Boateng (left) will face former side Manchester City when he lines up for Bayern Munich on Wednesday . DANTE - 6.5 . The bulky Brazilian defender can lose concentration easily. Could be a weak link for City to exploit. Dante (centre) will be at the heart of Bayern's defence as they look to beat Man City in the Champions League . PHILIPP LAHM - 8.5 . A consistent performer, steady passer and solid defender. Philipp Lahm will captain Bayern Munich from the heart of midfield against Manchester City on Wednesday . XABI ALONSO - 7.5 . Will try to dictate the pace of the game. In the absence of Bastian Schweinsteiger will be an important player in midfield. Xabi Alonso has thrived in midfield for new side Bayern Munich since his summer switch from Real Madrid . MARIO GOTZE - 7.5 . Scored the winning goal in the World Cup final and netted in Bayern’s 2-0 Bundesliga win over Stuttgart last week. Mario Gotze (centre) scored the winning goal in the World Cup final and will be a threat to the City defence . JUAN BERNAT - 7 . Bayern new boy is a Spanish under-21 international signed from Valencia. Highly rated for his tackling and danger he poses to opposition defence. Juan Bernat (left) will form part of an attacking trio for Bayern Munich against Manchester City on Wednesday . XHERDAN SHAQIRI - 7.5 . The 5ft 6in midfielder was a transfer target for Liverpool. His speed can be difficult to deal with. Xherdan Shaqiri scored a hat-trick at the World Cup and will aim to break down the Manchester City defence . THOMAS MULLER - 8.5 . This unorthodox striker sometimes appears bumbling but he works hard, has great awareness and scores plenty of goals. Thomas Muller scores important goals for club and country and will work his heart out for Bayern Munich . ROBERT LEWANDOWSKI - 8.5 . Polish front man has yet to find his feet at Bayern since joining from Borussia Dortmund in the summer but he thrives on the big occasions. TEAM AVERAGE - 7.8 . Robert Lewandowski was Pep Guardiola's big summer signing and he is a predator in front of opposition goal . VIDEO City's European time is now - Guardiola . MANCHESTER CITY . JOE HART - 7.5 . Commands respects from teammates but can get himself in sticky situations. Was beaten at his near post by Franck Ribery in Bayern’s 3-1 victory at the Etihad last season. Joe Hart was dropped after struggling against Bayern last season so it is a huge match for the City stopper . BACARY SAGNA - 7 . A capable deputy for Pablo Zabaleta but perhaps does not possess the same blood-and-guts determination as the fearsome Argentine. Bacary Sagna (left) will make his Champions League debut for Manchester City at the Allianz against Bayern . VINCENT KOMPANY - 8 . The captain is a fearless and steely presence in defence. Important because of the discipline he instils on the pitch. Vincent Kompany, Manchester City's captain, will be key to his side's chances at the heart of their defence . MARTIN DEMICHELIS - 7 . Has improved concentration levels but still prone to the occasional defensive error. A useful aerial threat from set pieces as demonstrated against Arsenal last week. Martin Demichelis has gone from a laughing stock last season to Mr Dependable at the back for Man City . ALEKSANDR KOLAROV - 8 . Has a sweet left foot and has scored two Champions League goals for City which bodes well. Aleksandr Kolarov will offer an attacking threat from left-back for City but he can be caught out defensively . YAYA TOURE - 8.5 . Dominates and still very much the focal point of the City midfield. On the brink of signing new contract at the Etihad according to Kompany. Yaya Toure should return in midfield and his power will be a key asset for City in the middle of the park . FERNANDINHO - 7 . Cannot be faulted for his commitment to the cause. Works tirelessly and makes crucial tackles. Fernandinho will once again shield the Manchester City back four from Bayern Munich's attacking threats . DAVID SILVA - 8.5 . Oozes class on the ball, the midfield magician can fashion a chance out of the most fleeting of opportunities. David Silva is crucial to Manchester City's attacking plans and he will aim to thread balls through for strikers . SERGIO AGUERO - 9 . He and Silva are the players that will most scare Bayern. Possesses an exciting burst of speed and capable of getting in behind defenders. Sergio Aguero is in fantastic goal-scoring form and he will hope to continue that on Wednesday at the Allianz . SAMIR NASRI - 7.5 . Creative and versatile but sometimes shirks defensive responsibilities. Samir Nasri can blow hot and cold but he is on song he is dangerous due to his trickery and guile . EDIN DZEKO - 7.5 . Vastly improved under the tutelage of Manuel Pelligrini. Looks hungry for the ball and is sharp in the box. TEAM AVERAGE - 7.6 . Edin Dzeko looks likely to be given the task of leading the line for City against Bayern at the Allianz Arena .","Manchester City face Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena on Wednesday .

"The ancient city of Alexandria was built to align with the rising sun on the day of Alexander the Great's birth, a new study suggests. The Macedonian empire builder, who conquered a swathe of territory stretching from Greece to Egypt in the west, to as far as the Indus River in the east, founded the city on Egypt's Mediterranean coast in 331BC. Now research shows that on Alexander's birthday the main east-west thoroughfare of the ancient city is 'in almost perfect alignment' with the rising sun of the fourth century. An engraving imagines the Great Lighthouse of Alexandria: New research shows the city, founded by Alexander the Great, was built to align with the sun on the day of the empire builder's birth . Giulio Magli, an archaeoastronomer at . the Politecnico of Milan, hopes his results could help researchers in . the hunt for Alexander's tomb, the location of which has been lost for . over 2,000 years. These days . a modern city home to 4million people, Alexandria was in ancient times . hugely prosperous and home to the Lighthouse of Alexandria, one of the . Wonders of the Ancient World, as well as the Library of Alexandria. However . a study of the ancient city's main thoroughfare, called the Canopic . Road, shows it was not laid out according to topography - sitting, as it . does, slightly off parallel with the Mediterranean coast. Professor . Magli and his colleague Luisa Ferro used a computer to plot the sun's . position in the fourth century B.C. Because the earth's orbit varies, . the path of the sun through the sky changes changes over time. Still prosperous: The modern city of Alexandria on Egypt's Mediterranean coast, which is these days home to 4million people . Alexander III, commonly known as Alexander the Great, was a king of Macedon, a state in northern ancient Greece. Born in Pella in 356 BC, Alexander was tutored by Aristotle until the age of 16. By the age of thirty, he had created one of the largest empires of the ancient world, stretching from the Ionian Sea to the Himalayas. He was undefeated in battle and is considered one of history's most successful commanders. Alexander died in Babylon in 323 BC, without executing a series of planned campaigns that would have begun with an invasion of Arabia. In the years following his death, a series of civil wars tore his empire apart, resulting in several states ruled by Alexander's surviving generals and heirs. After his death he became a near-legendary figure. He has long been the measure against which military leaders compare themselves and military academies throughout the world still teach his tactics. Alexander the Great was born on July . 20, 356BC, by the Julian calendar - which differs from our modern . calendar because it omits leap years, which keep our calendar . synchronised with the astronomical year. The researchers found that on that . day in the fourth century BC the sun rose in near perfect alignment with . the Canopic Road, at a spot less than half a degree off the road's . route. A second star would have reinforced . the effect. Regulus - the so-called 'King's star' which is the brightest . in the constellation of Leo, found near the lion's head - also rose in . near perfect alignment with the road. Professor Magli told LiveScience that basing architecture on astronomy was common in the ancient world. The Great Pyramid of Giza is in near-perfect alignment with the points of the compass, for example. The Egyptians, who Alexander conquered and who were admired in the ancient world for their science and maths, had long associated the sun god Ra with their own rulers, the pharaohs. The researchers say Alexandria was the prototype of a series of Hellenistic towns designed as ‘king's towns’ that aimed to make explicit the divine power of their founder. 'Aligning the city to the sun in the day of birth of Alexander was a way to embody in the architectural project an explicit reference to his power,' Professor Magli told LiveScience, adding that the King's Star would have only added to the mystique. Professor Magli and Ms Ferro are now examining other cities founded by Alexander and his successors to see if they maintain the link to the sun's route across the sky. Their research was reported online in the Oxford Journal of Archaeology.","In the fourth century BC the city's main road would have also lined up with Regulus, the 'King's Star' which is the brightest in the constellation of Leo .

"Danny Welbeck was not the only Arsenal man to show off his goal scoring ability on international duty this week. Over in Halmstad, Sweden, 19 year old midfielder Kristoffer Olsson scored a 36-minute hat-trick in Sweden Under 21’s 4-3 victory over Turkey. Olsson, who is currently out on loan in Denmark, scored two goals with his left foot and one with his right. Here, Sportsmail takes a look at this versatile youngster. Olsson, the Norwich City midfielder, right? No! That’s Martin Olsson. They are both from Sweden but that is where the similarities pretty much end. Kristoffer is a supremely skilful midfielder, who is composed in front of goal. Kristoffer Olsson scored a 36-minute hat-trick as Swden Under 21s beat Turkey Under 21s 4-3 . So what should we call this whizz kid? Kristoffer, or Kris for short, that’s what he seems to prefer. But don’t get him confused with the other Kris Olsson, the author of the bestselling memoir Boy, lost. I heard he was from Manchester? Not quite. He’s from the Swedish city of Norrköping, known as ‘little Manchester,’ because of its similarities to the Lancashire city. On the Baltic coast, this once industrial city is now known for its textile industry. It has nine football teams but many of the 87,000 locals play ice hockey. In fact Karl Magnus Svensson Pääjärvi, one of Sweden’s most famous ice hockey players hails from Norrköping. So what did little Kristoffer play? His first love was football. He started his career at Idrottsklubben Sleipner (or IK Sleipner for those who struggle with north Germanic pronunciation). There, he had to choose between football and ten-pin bowling. Unfortunately for the Swedish bowling league, he picked the beautiful game. Kristoffer is also a brilliant table tennis player. When he was younger he reportedly beat Wojech Szczesny and the Polish keeper sulked off. Kristoffer Olsson joined the Gunners in 2011, Chelsea had previously offered him a trial but he didn't turn up . When was he first spotted by English clubs? Chelsea invited him for a trial when he was 13 but Kristoffer was a no-show. Instead he moved to IFK Norrköping. He proved himself an excellent playmaker and subsequently attracted the attention of some of Europe’s biggest clubs, including Juventus and Ajax. In 2011, he signed for Arsenal for £200,000 which is beginning to look like a bargain. Is he part of the Brady bunch? Indeed. He is one of a number of good young Arsenal prospects who were scouted by club legend Liam Brady who returned to England and persuaded Arsene Wenger to sign up this Swedish youngster. ‘When they said they wanted me it felt unreal,’ said Kristoffer, shortly after arriving in north London, ‘I mean I played for a club in Sweden, and such a big club wanted me so that was just unreal in the beginning. But after a while I was just happy and proud.’ Kristoffer Olsson made 17 appearances for Arsenal's Under 21 side last season and one senior appearance . Does he stand out for anything other than his footballing ability? Oh yes. He has the same penchant for wacky hairstyles as his compatriot Freddie Ljunberg (back when he had hair). Still not out of his teens he has already mastered the Bjorn Borg headband look, the Boris Becker blond pineapple and the David Beckham Mohican. And he claimed he might die his hair Ljunberg red if he makes the Arsenal first team. He did in fact make his full debut for Arsenal in September 2013 as a substitute in a League Cup game against West Brom. He scored a penalty in the decisive shoot out but the hair dye hasn’t come out yet. So where is he now? He made 17 appearances for Arsenal Under-21’s last season but secured a loan move to Danish side FC Midtjylland before the start of this season. He said he had become bored of playing in front of just 500 people. He might soon have a bigger audience.","Kristoffer Olsson scored a hat-trick for Sweden Under 21 side .

"Brendan Rodgers believes he has a duty to prevent Raheem Sterling suffering burnout and make sure Liverpool’s England forward is still delivering peak performances in 10 years’ time. Sterling’s blistering development is rapidly making him a key player for club and country but, given that he is only 19, parallels can be drawn with Michael Owen. Owen also burst on to the biggest stage at a young age but a series of serious injuries prevented him reaching the heights many anticipated.

Liverpool’s boss insisted he had the player’s welfare at heart, saying: ‘Some managers would take the stance of “I don’t care” because you might only be in a job for three, four, five years, so make sure he plays as much as he can. ‘But I think it is critical that, in 10 years’ time, he is approaching his peak, as opposed to having played his best games. ‘When he gets to 28 and if he has too many miles on the clock and he is burned out, that is something we will have to look at. ‘As a club, we have managed him quite well but it is hard when you are such a good player and you keep performing and both your club and your country need you.’ Brendan Rodgers has helped Sterling mature into an international player, but he is not the finished article .","Rodgers says it is important that Sterling continues to develop .

"Ronald Koeman had one of the toughest jobs of any Premier League manager this summer as he tried to find replacements for a Southampton team raided of many of its best players. At the back he has recruited Toby Alderweireld, who he has known for a decade. Here, Sportsmail takes a look at what makes him special. New boy: Toby Alderweireld poses in his Southampton shirt after sealing a season-long loan move . Where is he from? Originally from a district of Antwerp called Wilrijk. Easy for you to say. Another Belgian in the Premier League, are they staging a takeover? Perhaps. Alderweireld, who represented his country in Brazil this summer, is the 16th Belgian currently playing in the top division, 13 of whom are full internationals. They could form an entire team, plus extras, or open a really good chocolate factory. So what are his vital statistics? He is a 25-year-old, 6ft1in centre back on a loan deal from Atletico Madrid but there is an option to buy for £6.3 million. He can also play right-back, offering additional cover for Calum Chambers after he was sold to Arsenal. Solid: Alderweireld (right) makes a clearance during the Champions League final against Real Madrid . Heads up: The former Ajax man struggled for playing time at Atleti, prompting his move to the Premier League . And can he fill a Dejan Lovren sized hole? Very possibly. He is a solid and experienced defender with 37 international caps. He can also score, his header against Malaga last season kept Atletico in the hunt for the title. Why did he want to leave the sunshine of Madrid? He wasn’t being played as much as he wanted in Spain, having moved from Ajax on a four-year deal in 2013. Toby had been a key part of the Ajax team, but played just 12 matches as Atletico won the La Liga title and got fed up of warming the bench. Did he want to be beside the seaside, too? Looks that way. Toby did a tour of the UK – granted not one that is overly prominent in the holiday brouchures – visiting Newcastle and Southampton with both clubs interested as well as Monaco. But he passed on the Baltic and the Mediterranean and opted for the south coast instead. Experienced: Alderweireld, pictured here in action against Russia at the World Cup, is a Belgium international . Fans' favourite: Some supporters in America have created YouTube videos in honour of Alderweireld's hair . Quite right, too. So why did he choose Southampton? Well, he knows new boss Ronald Koeman from their time at Ajax together. In August 2004, Alderweireld joined the youth academy managed by Koeman, who had spent three years playing for the club before taking charge of its first team in 2001. What’s his hair all about? Forget the Bendtner ponytail it’s all about the Alderweireld slick back, famous in its own right. There are even extensive YouTube tutorials made in America, by those with only a passing interest in ‘soccer’ but want their hair just like Toby.","Southampton signed Toby Alderweireld on loan on transfer deadline day .

"Manchester City have told UEFA chiefs that wealthy benefactors should not be penalised under financial fair play rules for investing heavily in clubs. City and Paris St Germain were each fined £49million for FFP rule breaches last season - and both clubs sent senior figures to a meeting chaired by UEFA president Michel Platini on Monday in Nyon, Switzerland, to discuss any changes to the rules.

"The Football Association is to start the search for a new top executive after general secretary Alex Horne announced he is to leave the organisation at the end of January. Horne, 42, has decided to look for a new role after overseeing a number of significant projects including the new Wembley Stadium, the national football centre at St George's Park, and securing the semi-finals and final of Euro 2020. Horne, who took up his current post in 2010, told Press Association Sport: 'After 11 fantastic years I have decided to look for a change of direction and I will be leaving the FA at the end of January.' FA general secretary Alex Horne will leave his position in January after 11 years with the organisation . There is likely to be hot demand to be his successor - FA accounts revealed that his total annual salary package was £528,000. Horne joined the FA in 2004 as finance director and, in 2006, was appointed Wembley Stadium's managing director before becoming the FA's chief operating officer in July 2008. He has also been a member of UEFA's competitions committee where he played a significant role in drawing up plans for staging the Euro 2020 tournament, which is being played in 13 countries across Europe. Horne was a leading figure in the development of the impressive St George's Park National Football Centre . St George's Park was opened by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on October 9, 2012 . Roy Hodgson's England senior team trained there during the recent international break . In an FA statement Horne added: 'I am incredibly proud to have worked for the FA for over a decade in many differing roles. It's been a privilege to have played my part in the financing, build and opening of Wembley Stadium and the national football centre at St George's Park, both of which will provide a huge benefit for the game. 'More importantly, it's been a pleasure to work alongside so many devoted and talented people within The FA who are passionate about developing and improving football across the country at all levels. Horne also played a key role at Wembley, acting as managing director of the stadium between 2006 and 2008 . 'This is probably the toughest decision I have made during my career. At the age of 42, the time is right for me to look for a change of direction.' The FA Board will start the search for a successor immediately with key requirements being skill and experience in finance and marketing. FA chairman Greg Dyke said: 'On behalf of the board and the staff at the FA, I would like to thank Alex for his dedicated leadership in a variety of roles over the last decade. 'I will now work with the board on finding his successor.'","Alex Horne will leave the Football Association in January 2015 .

"European clubs will next week demand UEFA close a loophole that allows some clubs to qualify for the Champions League without submitting accounts to comply with financial fair play (FFP) rules. There is widespread concern among clubs that teams such as Liverpool, Monaco and Roma did not have to submit their accounts to UEFA last season because they were not involved in European competition. Senior figures in the European Clubs' Association (ECA) believe that gives the clubs an advantage in terms of qualifying for the lucrative tournament in that they are not subject to the same spending constraints. Liverpool are one of a number of clubs who did not have to submit their accounts to UEFA last season . The Reds are hoping to write off losses as allowable stadium expenditure as they are investigated . Liverpool, Roma and Monaco all qualified for the Champions League and it is only this season that they have had to submit their accounts. UEFA announced two weeks ago that they are among seven clubs being investigated for possible FFP breaches. UEFA said the clubs had 'disclosed a break-even deficit on the basis of their financial reporting periods ending in 2012 and 2013'. The issue will be brought up when UEFA holds a meeting with clubs on Monday to discuss any changes to the FFP rules. One European club executive said: 'It makes no sense that clubs can qualify for the Champions League without having had to submit their accounts - it can even encourage them to overspend in order to qualify. UEFA are also investigating clubs including Ashley Cole's (L) Roma as well as Monaco and Inter Milan . 'We are meeting UEFA next week and we will push them to close this loophole.' Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain were the clubs punished most severely by UEFA last season for FFP rule-breaches - both were fined £49million - and they are among those invited to the meeting on Monday in Nyon, Switzerland. The meeting is also expected to look at whether large debts carried by clubs such as Manchester United and Real Madrid should also be tackled more strongly by FFP rules. Currently, only the interest on those debts is viewed as part of the FFP calculation. Manchester City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak said in the summer: 'We have zero debt. We don't pay a penny to service any debt. For me, that is a sustainable model. However, our friends at UEFA seem to believe otherwise. They have their view; we have ours.' Gianni Infantino, UEFA's general secretary, said on Thursday: 'Certainly, the question of debt is something that can be put on the table.'

"Premier League matches will be staged abroad within two years, Swansea chairman Huw Jenkins has claimed. The move has been discussed by Premier League chairmen at their most recent meeting but no firm plans have been drawn up.

'While we may not be 100 per cent about it, as passionate football supporters just watching football as we have, it's going to be a big change. 'The other side of that is we have got to make sure we are on the bandwagon with them or we are going to get left behind otherwise. 'There's definitely going to be a run of games played abroad in 12 months or two years.

"Sebastian Coe has written off the chance a British men's football team playing at the Rio 2016 Olympics but has raised the possibility of a women's team doing so again. Britain did field football teams at London 2012 but without any Scots or Northern Irish players in the men's side following opposition from the Scottish and Irish FAs. The men's side featuring the like of Ryan Giggs, Aaron Ramsey and Daniel Sturridge went out in the quarter-finals on penalties against South Korea. Sebastian Coe says there's very little chance of a British men's football team at the 2016 Olympics . The men's British football team were knocked out on penalties at the quarter-final stage in 2012 . Coe said there could still be a British women's football team in Rio but nothing has been confirmed . Lord Coe, chairman of the British Olympic Association, said the body was working under the assumption there would be no men's team in 2016 given the difficulties encountered in the run-up to London. Speaking at the Securing Sport conference in London, Coe said the chances of a British men's team in Rio were 'unlikely'. He added: 'It's just in the 'hard' basket. Possibly a women's team but I would rather assume that, operationally, that's not going to happen in terms of the men's team. The British women's football team were also eliminated at the quarter-final stage at London 2012 . Daniel Sturridge missed a penalty in the shoot-out defeat to South Korea two years ago . 'Possibly with (the) women's (team), we've still got some discussions. 'But certainly, the men's team, I'm not sure I have the will to live through that process again.' The women's 2012 squad featured two Scots but the rest of the players were English. They lost to Canada 2-0 in the quarter-finals. It was the first time Britain had had football teams in the Games since 1960. The issue is a sensitive one as the Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland FAs fear participation could threaten their individual status within FIFA.

"Football Association vice-chairman David Gill has declared he will stand for Britain's FIFA vice-presidency next year following a change of heart. Gill, a Manchester United director and UEFA executive committee member, had been insistent he would not stand for the post, where he is likely to face rival bids from Scottish FA president Campbell Ogilvie and Welsh FA president Trefor Lloyd Hughes. His previous stance led the FA to consider current and former players including Rio Ferdinand and Graeme Le Saux as candidates until Gill - regarded as the obvious candidate - changed his mind and agreed to stand. It is understood that UEFA president Michel Platini had suggested to Gill that he should run for the post. Former Manchester United chief executive David Gill (right), pictured with Sir Alex Ferguson, has announced his intention to stand for Britain's FIFA vice-presidency . Gill has had a change of heart after initially ruling himself out of the running for the FIFA post . QPR defender Rio Ferdinand had been considered as a candidate for the role by the Football Association . Gill said in a statement: 'This is a decision I have been thinking about for some time. Although I had initially wanted to focus on developing my relatively new role within UEFA, I believe there is an opportunity, if elected, to use the FIFA position to make a real difference while complementing that ongoing work. 'Having sounded out many people across the game including fellow board members at Manchester United, the FA and UEFA, I would hope to make a positive contribution and use my candidacy to drive a debate for continued reform.' An election will take place at the UEFA congress in Vienna in March, with all UEFA members voting from a list of candidates put forward by the four British associations.

"European clubs will demand cash compensation if the 2022 World Cup in Qatar is moved to the winter. FIFA is considering moving the tournament to avoid the fierce summer heat but European Clubs' Association (ECA) chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said the cost of moving to the winter could not be borne by the clubs. Rummenigge, who is also chairman of German champions Bayern Munich, told the Leaders in Sport conference in London: 'We are ready to discuss changing the date under one condition - that there is no damage for club football because if we change from summer to November or January it will affect our business. For the World Cup to take place in Qatar in 2022, it may have to be moved to the winter due to the climate . 'That cost cannot be paid by the clubs. We are not ready to pay it and it has to be made clear to FIFA that they need the goodwill of the clubs or we are not ready to talk or discuss it. 'The fact is 76 per cent of all players in the last two World Cups were contracted by European clubs.' AC Milan executive director Umberto Gandini, vice-chairman of the ECA, said the Winter Olympics in 2022 should be moved to accommodate a winter World Cup. Moving the tournament would cost clubs money, something Karl-Heinz Rummenigge says cannot happen . He said: 'The World Cup is one of the major events in the sports landscape [along] with the summer Olympics. But the Winter Olympics are not up there. 'When you have such a huge event like the World Cup don't tell me it's not possible to move the Winter Olympics a bit, especially with it still in the bid process and there are only two candidates [Beijing and Almaty].' The International Olympic Committee said it had been reassured by FIFA president Sepp Blatter there will be no clash with the Winter Olympics. 76 per cent of players at Brazil 2014 played for European clubs, so Sepp Blatter and FIFA need their support .","Karl-Heinz Rummenigge says clubs must not bear cost of Qatar 2022 .

"The broadcast regulator Ofcom has been asked by cable giant Virgin Media to open a formal investigation into the way the Premier League sells its TV rights. Virgin Media claims fans are forced to pay over the odds to watch games on television and that a further 60% rise in the cost of the rights is predicted in the next auction . Brigitte Trafford, Virgin Media's chief corporate affairs officer, said in a statement: 'The rapidly rising cost of Premier League live broadcast rights means UK fans pay the highest prices in Europe to watch football on TV. Virgin Media has asked Ofcom to investigate how the rights are sold ahead of the next auction.' Virgin Media has asked Ofcom to open an investigation under the Competition Act 1998 claiming that 'significant consumer harm resulting from escalating rights costs' can be addressed by making changes to the way in which live rights are sold. Sky Sports paid the Premier League over £2billion for 116 live games a season over three years . Newcomers BT Sport acquired 38 live Premier League games per season at a cost of £738million . Michael Owen working as a pundit for BT Sport . The Premier League's current domestic live TV rights increased by 70 per cent to £3billion after Sky and BT Sport shared seven packages in the last auction for the 2013-16 rights. The next Premier League tender is expected to go out in the new year with the next set of three-year deals announced before the end of the season. A Virgin Media statement said: 'A review is required with the next auction imminent and a further 60% inflation in costs predicted.' The company filed its complaint with Ofcom two weeks ago and a decision is expected in late October or early November. Virgin Media's complaint is understood to suggest that fans in the UK have to pay £51 monthly for access to all top-flight matches on TV, while it is £25 in Italy, £21 in Germany, £18 in Spain and £10 in France. Virgin Media is not planning to bid for the Premier League rights but carries Sky Sports and BT Sport on its cable networks, so it passes on the costs of live Premier League football to its own customers. Mike Fries, chief executive of Liberty Global, which owns Virgin Media, said earlier this year the company had no intention to bid for live Premier League TV rights. The complaint to Ofcom claims consumers do not benefit from competition between channel providers in terms of the cost, and that the restriction on the number of matches being shown live limits consumer choice.","Virgin claim fans are forced to pay over the odds to watch Premier League .

"FIFA's ethics investigator has called for his secret report into World Cup bidding to be made public. Michael Garcia, a US attorney, said it is 'necessary' for FIFA's executive committee to authorize the publication of his report into alleged corruption and claims of rule-breaking in the bids for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. The judge in charge of issuing sanctions, Hans-Joachim Eckert, said last week he would not publish the report. Britain's FIFA vice-president Jim Boyce has joined calls from fellow executive committee members Prince Ali Bin Hussein from Jordan and Sunil Gulati from the United States for the report to be made public. Michael Garcia (left) believes that Joachim Eckert (right) should authorise publication of his corruption report . The issue is expected to be discussed at FIFA's executive committee meeting in Zurich on Thursday and Friday. FIFA president Sepp Blatter is due to hold a news conference on Friday following the meeting. Garcia said in a statement: 'Given the limited role Mr Hans-Joachim Eckert envisions for the adjudicatory chamber, I believe it is now necessary for the FIFA executive committee to authorise the appropriate publication of the report on the inquiry into the 2018/2022 FIFA World Cup bidding process. 'Publication would be consistent with statements made by a number of executive committee members, with the view recently expressed by independent governance committee Chair Mark Pieth, and with the goals of the reform process.' There has been tension between lawyer Garcia and Eckert (pictured), who is FIFA's ethics judge . Boyce, from Northern Ireland, added his voice to the calls. He told Press Association Sport: 'I fully support these views. If people have nothing to fear they should not worry about things becoming public knowledge.' Prince Ali made his remarks on Twitter while Gulati, the president of US Soccer, told the New York Times: 'If we're going to truly support the idea of transparency and change within FIFA, it has to be made public in the truest meaning of the word. 'That doesn't mean only to the executive committee. It has to be more. 'Right now, the whole story is not about what's in the report but whether it should be made public. And that isn't ideal for anyone.' Russia won the vote for the 2018 World Cup - England were among the losing bids - while Qatar was chosen as 2022 hosts.

"Qatar World Cup chiefs have insisted there is no possibility of the 2022 tournament being moved to a different country. Germany's FIFA member Theo Zwanziger believes the 2022 World Cup will be moved from Qatar due to the extreme temperatures and the threat of legal action. FIFA has always stressed the World Cup will be in Qatar but is currently looking at moving the dates to the winter to avoid the heat, and tournament organisers insist the only question is 'when' it will be held in Qatar and not 'if'. Nasser Al Khater says there is no chance of the 2022 World Cup being moved to a different country . Nasser Al Khater, executive director of communications for Qatar 2022's supreme committee for delivery & legacy, said in a statement: 'Qatar will host the FIFA World Cup in 2022, despite comments of FIFA Executive Committee member Dr. Zwanziger, which reflect his personal opinion and not that of FIFA. 'The only question now is when, not if. Summer or winter, we will be ready. We have proven that a FIFA World Cup in Qatar in the summer is possible with state-of-the-art cooling technology. 'We have demonstrated that our cooling works in outdoor areas beyond stadiums. This summer we welcomed fans in Doha to an open-air Brazil 2014 Fan Zone with temperatures cooled to a comfortable 22 degrees Celsius. Theo Zwanziger (left) does not believe it will be possible to have the World Cup in Qatar in 2022 . 'The evolution of environmentally-friendly cooling technologies is an important legacy for our nation, region and for countries with similar climates - promising to expand the reach of hosting major sporting events to countries where it was never thought possible before.' Zwanziger, who sits on FIFA's all-powerful executive committee, believes the threat of legal action may force the World Cup to be moved. He told Sport Bild: 'I personally believe that in the end the 2022 World Cup will not take place in Qatar. 'Medical experts say that they cannot accept responsibility for a World Cup taking place under these conditions. 'They may be able to cool the stadiums but a World Cup does not take place only there (in the stadiums). Zwanziger believes the extreme hot weather will make it impossible for FIFA to stage the tournament in Qatar . 'Fans from all around the world will be coming and travelling in that heat and the first life-threatening case will trigger an investigation by a state prosecutor. 'That is not something that FIFA executive committee members will want to be responsible for.' No decision has yet been made on the timing of a winter World Cup but there has already been opposition from leagues and clubs. Meanwhile, a British MP who has campaigned for FIFA reform has written to the Serious Fraud Office asking that it demands a copy of FIFA ethics investigator Michael Garcia's report in the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. Michael Garcia (left) is said to be furious after Hans Joachim-Eckert (right) said his report will stay private . Damian Collins believes the SFO has the right to be given a copy as it has previously investigated corruption allegations made by former FA chairman Lord Triesman. Judge Hans-Joachim Eckert, the German judge who is the head of the ethics committee's adjudicatory panel, stated last week that the report's contents would not be made public. Collins says in his letter to the SFO: 'I am writing to ask if you would request from FIFA a copy of Michael Garcia's report. FIFA seems to believe it is a self governing body that operates outside the jurisdiction of international and national law enforcement agencies. 'I do not believe this is the case and that if they hold information that indicates that offences may have been committed this must be shared with the relevant law enforcement agencies.'","Qatar due to host World Cup in 2022 .

"Mediocre players from overseas are taking places in club squads that should be going to young English players, Football Association chairman Greg Dyke has claimed. The FA has announced proposals to cut the number of players from outside the European Union coming into the English game by up to 50 per cent, including banning clubs sending such players out on loan, preventing Football League clubs from signing them and making the appeals process much tougher. Some 122 overseas players were granted visas between 2009 and 2013, 23 of them in the Football League. Young English players like Raheem Sterling (pictured) are suffering due to the amount of foreign imports, says FA chairman Greg Dyke . Dyke (left) believes Premier League and Football League squads are getting crammed full of foreign players . Dyke told Sky Sports News: 'Everyone recognises the present system is bust. 'The rules say elite non-European players - the very best - should be allowed to come in and we agree with that. 'What we are saying is there are a lot that aren't (the very best), that don't play that much and do take squad places and a lot particularly in the Football League disappear after a year or so. The system doesn't work at the moment. 'What we are saying is ""let the best players come in but give the rest of those squad places to young English kids"". 'We still have the problem of good kids aged 17 and 18 and they are not getting enough competitive football so we are still looking at how we improve that position.' The proposals are part of a number of changes recommended by Dyke's England Commission. He said he would make further announcements in October on plans to improve grassroots facilities and coaches. England captain Wayne Rooney progressed to national standard after being given his chance at Everton . Greg Dyke (pictured) wants to see a 50 per cent drop in foreign imports to England in coming seasons . The proposals on non-EU players would also mean only players from the top 50-ranked countries in the world could be signed unless the transfer fee is more than a fixed figure, either £10million or £15million. The issue of a fixed transfer fee is likely to be opposed however, as some players would be available for free if they are at the end of their contract. The ruling would apply to all players from Brazil, Argentina, Asia, Africa, the Americas, and Australasia who do not hold EU passports. The FA will now hold talks with the Premier League, Football League, PFA, LMA and the national FAs of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Dyke said he expected the other stakeholders to come up with their own proposals. He added: 'I think they will come up with other ideas. Everyone recognises the present system is bust. So they will look at it and come up with some ideas and we will look at them.' A Football League spokesman said: 'We will consider the consultation before responding in due course.' Emmanuel Adebayor is one of the players who would not have been eligible to play in England under these rules .

"Cristiano Ronaldo has warned Angel di Maria that filling the number seven shirt at Manchester United will be 'a big responsibility' but has backed him to rise to the challenge. Di Maria will be following in the footsteps of Ronaldo in playing in that shirt after his £59.7million move from Real Madrid, as well as other United greats including George Best and Bryan Robson. Ronaldo, speaking at the Champions League draw in Monaco, added that he was relishing the prospect of facing Liverpool in Europe but that Real were determined to hold on to their crown even without the likes of Di Maria, to whom he sent a message of support.

He said: 'Our target is to win it again - the Champions League, the Cup the League - everything. 'We're going to try to do the same this season, win the Champions League.

"Julio Grondona, Argentina’s FIFA vice-president who was the second-most powerful man in world football and an avowed enemy of the English, has died aged 82. Grondona was FIFA’s senior vice-president, behind only president Sepp Blatter in the pecking order, and as chairman of the influential FIFA finance committee held the purse strings of the global organisation. Grondona - infamous for calling the English 'liars and pirates' - had been head of the Argentine FA since 1979 and on FIFA’s executive committee since 1988. Powerful: Argentinian FIFA vice-president Julio Grondona has died aged 82 . Money: Grondona (left), here pictured with Argentina legend Diego Maradona, was extremely rich . He managed to avoid becoming a victim of the corruption scandals which claimed the reputations of the three other fellow South Americans who dominated FIFA from the 1980s well into this century: Joao Havelange, Ricardo Teixeira and Nicolas Leoz were all found in 2013 to have taken massive bribes from FIFA’s collapsed marketing partner ISL. Grondona will take any secrets to the grave, but he was a hugely wealthy man - even before his FIFA involvement he had founded and been president of the Arsenal Futbol Club in Buenos Aires from 1957 to 1976. He took over as head of the AFA a year after the country had won the World Cup for the first time in 1978. For the next decade he thrived, and was often pictured with the dictators that ruled the country, often brutally, during that time. Indeed, Grondona never made any secret of his support for Argentina’s claim to the Falkland Islands which saw his country to go war with Britain in 1982, and in recent years never hid his dislike for the English. Sovereignty: Grondona (right), with Maradona (centre), supported Argentina's claim to the Falkland island . Dislike: Grondona was famed for disliking the English who he called 'liars and pirates' In 2011, Grondona launched a blast at the English after then FA chairman David Bernstein asked the FIFA Congress to postpone the presidential election where Blatter was elected unopposed. Grondona told the Congress: 'We always have attacks from England which are mostly lies with the support of journalism which is more busy lying than telling the truth. This upsets and disturbs the FIFA family. 'I see it at every congress. England is always complaining so, please I say, will you leave the FIFA family alone, and when you speak, speak with truth.' In an interview with a German press agency, Grondona had earlier called England 'pirates' and added: 'With the English [2018 World Cup] bid I said: ‘Let us be brief. If you give back the Falkland Islands, which belong to us, you will get my vote’. They then became sad and left.' Grondona was also thought to have voted in favour of Qatar hosting the 2022 World Cup. Documents show a briefing note to Qatar’s bid officials proposed that Qatar extend financial assistance to the Argentina FA after it suffered a financial crisis in August 2009, including a suggestion that the Qatari TV company Al Jazeera could purchase TV rights. Missed: Grondona avoided being investigated for bribery in relation to the Qatar 2022 World Cup bid . After the vote in 2010, Grondona denied that the AFA had received any payment from Qatar - one former Qatar bid official told the Wall Street Journal that a payment of £44million had been recommended. Grondona responded then saying: 'There has to be an end to playing with my good name. Why on earth would the association have a debt of that size? 'I am not going to give any credence to whatever people may say. The fact is the AFA has a solid contract with the Argentine government and it is all going quite well.' Grondona died at the Sanatorio Mitre private medical centre in Buenos Aires on Wednesday where he had been taken after suffering an aortic aneurysm. On hearing the news, Blatter said on Twitter: 'I am very sad for the loss of a great friend. Julio Grondona has left us at the age of 82 and are thoughts are with his family. May he rest in peace.' Grondona’s son Humberto became embroiled in a World Cup ticket scandal in Brazil after he admitted selling on tickets - including two to the final - to a friend.

"Legal aspects surroundings Scotland's bid to host games at Euro 2020 'may have to be re-assessed' if the nation becomes independent following next week's referendum, according to UEFA's report into bidding countries. The Scottish FA has submitted a bid for Glasgow's Hampden Park to host three group games and one match in the knock-out rounds of the tournament, which is being held in 13 countries around Europe. Cardiff's Millennium Stadium and the Dublin Arena are also bidding for group matches, while Wembley is the favourite to host the final with only one rival in Munich. UEFA's executive committee will vote on the host cities on September 19, the day after the Scottish referendum. Transformed: Glasgow's Hampden Park (pictured here with the athletics track used during the Commonwealth Games) has bid to host four Euro 2020 matches but independence could raise legal problems . Special moment: Scotland winger Ikechi Anya places the ball past Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer . The evaluation report carried out by UEFA into the bids says of the Scottish bid: 'Scotland being part of the UK, the legal situation is mostly - but not entirely - identical to that of England and Wales. 'The situation may have to be re-assessed should Scotland become independent of the UK following the referendum.' The evaluation report also criticises the commercial part of the Scotland bid as being 'inadequate' and 'lacking clarity'. It says: 'The commercial sector of the bid is inadequate, as the information provided lacks clarity. The amount of advertising space offered is vague.' Glasgow's transport links and hotel accommodation are praised however, as is its plans for fan zones. Cardiff's bid gets a generally favourable evaluation report, but inspectors point out that fans would have to use airports in Bristol or even London. Fans: Scotland supporters will hope they are still able to host Euro 2020 matches if independence happens . Dublin receives one of the best evaluation reports among all 19 bidders, with hotel accommodation praised as 'very impressive'. The evaluation report of the FA's Wembley Stadium bid is generally positive and similar to that received by Munich, although the proposed fan zone outside of central London is rated as only 'satisfactory' and plans for fan zones in other English cities as 'very weak'. Munich's fan zone proposal is rated as 'attractive' but plans for fan zones in other German cities also rated as 'weak'. Wembley is regarded as the favourite after the German FA announced it may not push hard for Munich in order to concentrate on a bid to host the entire Euro 2024 tournament. UEFA's report also raises concerns about the political situation in Israel and Russia, who are also bidding with Jerusalem and St Petersburg respectively. The political situation in Israel is described as 'complex' due to the recent Gaza conflict and Russia's as 'increasingly complex', following its involvement in the Ukraine crisis.

The announcement by Lampard, 36, comes as little surprise after his change of clubs this summer, and brings down the curtain on a fine England career that began 15 years ago in 1999 and ended at the World Cup in Brazil in June. The former Chelsea midfielder said the decision had been a tough one, but that his new club career with Major League Soccer side New York City - and his current loan spell at Manchester City - had persuaded him the time was right after winning 106 caps and scoring 29 goals for his country. 'Superb': Frank Lampard has been praised by England manager Roy Hodgson after his international retirement . England manager Hodgson said: 'Frank Lampard has been a superb representative of the English game - both as a player on the pitch and an ambassador off it. 'To reach in excess of 100 international caps is something very few professionals achieve and he is in exalted company. Decorated: Lampard's England career ends after 106 appearances and 29 goals for his country . 'He has served the national team quite brilliantly during his 15-year international career. It is with regret that I accept and understand the decision he's made.' Lampard made his final England performance in the World Cup against Costa Rica, and he follows Steven Gerrard in announcing his retirement. He said in a statement: 'I have taken the decision to retire from international football. It has been a very tough decision for me to make which is why I have given it so much thought since the World Cup. 'Due to my club career now going in a different direction it is of utmost importance for me to consider my family first - also, to concentrate on how I can perform consistently to the best of my abilities over my next few years in club football.' Lampard was part of a generation of hugely-talented young English players who emerged during the late 1990s - David Beckham, Gerrard, Michael Owen, Paul Scholes, Rio Ferdinand, Joe Cole, Gary Neville and Sol Campbell were among the others. The closest that group came to securing major honours came at Euro 2004, when they were knocked out on penalties by hosts Portugal in the quarter-finals despite having dominated the game. They also departed at the same stage at the 2002 and 2006 World Cups, the last time England made the last-eight of a major tournament. Exalted company: Hodgson (right) said Lampard 'served the national team quite brilliantly' over 15 years . No one doubted the abilities of such a talented midfield, but successive managers struggled to accommodate Lampard, Gerrard and Scholes and one of them was often detailed to operate on the left, a tactic which rarely worked. Lampard's talent for scoring goals set him apart - no other midfielder has scored more for England and that talent was recognised by Gary Lineker, who paid tribute to him as 'a fine player, an outstanding finisher and a credit to the game of football'. Only an appalling decision by an assistant referee at the 2010 World Cup denied Lampard joining the ranks of those players who have scored 30 goals for England. Lampard's disallowed goal against Germany, despite clearly crossing the line, may however turn out to be his greatest legacy to international football: that was the incident that caused FIFA president Sepp Blatter to perform a U-turn and usher in goal-line technology. Final appearance: Lampard walks off the pitch after what would be his final game in an England shirt, their 0-0 draw with Costa Rica at the World Cup in Brazil . Lampard said that changes in youth development in English football now promised much. He said: 'It is now the time to move forward and I feel very confident that, with Roy Hodgson in charge, the young players that we have coming through and the changes that are being made throughout the development of the youth system in this country, we will have success in the future and a team that this country deserves. 'I would like to thank all the managers that I have worked under, all the players that I have been fortunate enough to play alongside, and all the England fans for their support, not only at home, but particularly on their travels with the team around the world. 'I now look forward to continuing to support the team as a fan and wish them every success for the upcoming campaign towards France 2016.' Young gun: Lampard scores in an under-21 win over Luxembourg in 1999, the year he made his full debut . Hodgson said he had not tried to persuade Lampard to change his mind. 'I've been aware since discussions in Brazil that Frank was considering his England future. I spoke to him since his loan to Manchester City about the possibility of him retiring, primarily due to the fact that he's taken on new commitments both here and abroad,' he said. 'I know it's not a decision he's taken lightly and, as with Steven Gerrard's decision, I promised Frank that I would accept his choice with good grace and not try to change his mind.' Lampard is the joint sixth most-capped player in England history, level with Sir Bobby Charlton, while his 29 England goals puts him joint ninth on the list of scorers.

"The British executive arrested as part of a World Cup ticket touting investigation has been released from prison in Brazil. Ray Whelan, a director of FIFA's ticketing and accommodation partners MATCH, had been held in the notorious Bangu Prison in Rio de Janeiro. The 64-year-old, a former agent to Sir Bobby Charlton, has now been released after Brazilian supreme court judge, Judge Marco Aurelio Mello granted him an injunction, according to Whelan's lawyer Fernando Fernandes. Captive: Ray Whelan, the director of MATCH services, is being held in a prison in Rio de Janeiro . 'The judge showed that, more than only the capacity to organise a FIFA World Cup, we have a constitution that must be respected,' said Fernandes. Whelan's defence 'will dedicate itself entirely to obtaining integral access to the evidence that has not been granted yet, in order that it may dismiss the accusations against Mr Whelan,' said a statement from the lawyer. Jaime Byrom, the MATCH executive chairman and Whelan's brother-in-law, said last month the decision to place him in custody in Bangu appeared 'extreme' and that he was confident he would be cleared of any wrongdoing. Bangu Prison is home to some of Brazil's most dangerous criminals, including murderers, drugs traffickers and gang members but Whelan had been given a private cell. Byrom said then: 'It does seem extreme for us to have a member of our company and our family in prison, least of all in a prison such as Bangu which is typically reserved for crimes such as drug-trafficking, murder and crimes against the state. 'I am absolutely confident the Brazilian legal system will clear him of any wrongdoing and we are very well-placed to assist the authorities with their inquiries.' Whelan was first arrested four weeks ago and released on bail, but he then disappeared from his hotel two weeks ago via a service entrance minutes before police investigating illegal World Cup ticket sales arrived to arrest him again. Centre of probe: Brazilian police have described Whelan as the 'facilitator' of the scandal which saw tickets being sold for vastly-inflated prices . Caught: The Copacabana Palace Hotel in Rio de Janeiro where Whelan was arrested . Byrom - one of the founders of the Stockport-based company Byrom plc which owns MATCH - said Whelan had left the hotel on the advice of his lawyer. The case against Whelan centres on mobile phone conversations between him and a French-Algerian, Lamine Fofana, who is alleged to be the leader of the ticket touting ring. Police have released the recordings to the Brazilian media and Whelan can be heard negotiating the sale of 24 hospitality packages for 25,000 US dollars (£14,650) each - the face value - in cash, totalling 600,000 dollars (£352,000). Whelan works for MATCH Services, Match's accommodation company, but Byrom said he had been authorised to sell 30 packages that Match Services had been left with when a Brazilian hotel chain decided only to take up 12 of the 42 packages it had reserved. Fofana had been blocked by MATCH Hospitality from purchasing packages the previous month, but Byrom said the fact Whelan worked for MATCH Services meant he would have had no knowledge of that fact.","Ray Whelan released from Rio de Janeiro prison .

"Barcelona will not be allowed to publicly unveil new £75million signing Luis Suarez while he remains banned for biting, FIFA has confirmed. Suarez is due to complete his move from Liverpool in the next few days, and the Catalan club has previously introduced star signings including Neymar and Cesc Fabregas to packed stadiums. There have been suggestions Barcelona could hold a similar event for Suarez in a non-football venue to get around the four-month ban imposed on the Uruguay striker for biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini, but FIFA has now confirmed that any such event will not be permitted while the ban remains in force. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Barcelona reveal Luis Suarez's number 9 shirt . Thumbs up: Suarez pictured wearing the famous colours of the Catalan giants . Back in the day: Suarez at his Liverpool unveiling in 2011 - alongside Andy Carroll and Kenny Dalglish . Seeing is believing: Suarez was voted Player of the Year last season after a stunning campaign with Liverpool . Happy days: Suarez arriving at Anfield in 2011 (left) and lifting the Capital One Cup in 2012 (right) Haunted: The 27-year-old scored twice for Uruguay against England at the World Cup in Sao Paulo . FIFA's head of media Delia Fischer said: 'The ban relates to all football-related activity. He cannot be in a football-related public event irrespective of the venue. 'He cannot even be involved in a football-related charity event.' Suarez, 27, had his appeal against the four-month ban, plus a nine-match international and an 100,000 Swiss franc (£66,000) fine, rejected outright by FIFA's appeals committee. He is expected to take his appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in a final bid to reduce the sanctions that, as they stand, will keep him out of club football until the end of October. Name on the shirt: But Suarez can't be shown off to fans at the Nou Camp or elsewhere . Number nine: They might not be able to unveil him but Barcelona fans can already buy Suarez's shirt . Different: Neymar and Cesc Fabregas both underwent high profile unveilings at the Nou Camp . Suarez can also ask CAS to put his ban on hold pending their final decision but that would risk him missing more matches rather than a chunk of the close season if the court upholds the sanctions. Some 90,000 packed the Nou Camp stadium for the unveiling of Brazil forward Neymar in June 2013. FIFA's original ban took into account that Suarez had shown no remorse for the biting incident, his third such attack in less than four years. The player then did issue an official apology but it did not lead to any change of mind by the FIFA appeals panel. Suarez's lawyer on Friday claimed the punishment was 'blatantly draconian, totalitarian and fascist'. Alejandro Balbi told Spanish radio station Cope: 'The right of a footballer to work is being violated, and football should be worried about that. 'The nine (international) games may seem excessive, but the fact that he can't watch a game of football, or train or carry out his job, we are talking about unpleasant things.' Painful blow: Suarez's bite on Chiellini led to him getting his four-month ban from football-related activity .","Barca had planned to unveil new striker at a non-football venue .

"Maurice Jones-Drew is ready to return to boost the Oakland Raiders’ ailing running game against the Miami Dolphins. The diminutive running back has been sidelined for the past two games following surgery on his right hand, but practised fully for the first time. And he is champing at the bit to assist fellow tailback Darren McFadden, with the Raiders ranked 31st in the NFL with an average of 64.3 yards per game. ‘Everything’s good. I thought I was able to go last week. But the coaches just weren’t comfortable with it - they still wanted me to go out and protect myself. Oakland Raiders running back Maurice Jones-Drew (centre) is set to return from injury against Miami . ‘This week I feel great: punching, doing everything, taking care of the ball with my right hand. ‘If it was up to me I would have played two weeks ago, but obviously I don’t have the final say here, so it’s one of those deals.’ Head coach Dennis Allen backed up Jones-Drew, adding: ‘I think he’s in a better spot now than he was two weeks ago and even where he was last week. Signs are pointing that he’s going to be ready to go for this weekend.’ After coming up short against the tough run defenses of the New York Jets, Houston Texans and New England Patriots, the Raiders may have an opportunity to gain some headway on the ground. The 1-2 Dolphins have allowed an average of 125.3 yards per game, but Jones-Drew praised his Wembley opponents. ‘They’re a fast defense. The linebackers do a great job when they blitz. They use their hands well, which is something for a guy with not long arms you’ve got to be able to get into the body a little bit, so that’s something we’ve worked on this week.’ Running Back Maurice Jones-Drew #21 of the Oakland Raiders has a short gain against the New York Jets . ‘And then how they tackle. Their defensive line does a great job of getting penetration so being able to get around the defensive line up to the second level and make people miss.’ With the Raiders desperate to kick-start their season before the bye, Jones-Drew . ‘The last couple of weeks have been hard on us,’ Jones-Drew said. ‘I know Darren’s doing a great job, but it’s been kind of hard for us to get the running game going. So hopefully myself coming in to try and run the ball a little bit and protect it and catch the ball in the backfield will help us out a little bit.’ The Raiders received a boost in the shape of linebacker Miles Burris returning to limited practice. With both Nick Roach and Sio Moore doubtful for Sunday’s game, Allen has only three fit linebackers to choose from - Kalil Mack, Kalula Maiava and rookie Bojay Filimoeatu, who was on the practice squad two weeks ago.

"The Oakland Raiders arrived in England battling jetlag and chasing a first win of the season. But that isn’t all, as they plan to make England their home for the remainder of the week. With a depleted linebacking corps and a worrying inability to score touchdowns, Dennis Allen’s side are certainly down, but not necessarily out. And as the bleary-eyed squad familiarise themselves with their sumptuous Surrey surrounds, the Raiders finished their first practice on English soil in high spirits ahead of their ‘home’ game with the Miami Dolphins at Wembley on Sunday. Oakland Raiders head coach Dennis Allen gave his players some time off to recover from the jetlag . A Raiderette struts her stuff on Regent Street in central London this week . ‘I thought practice was pretty good,’ said head coach Allen. ‘Obviously we got here Monday morning and the guys had a little bit of time on Monday and Tuesday to catch up on a little bit of rest. Now we’ll get started with a normal game week preparation. 'I think the further we go into the week, the more acclimated the guys will get to the time change and hopefully that won’t be any sort of factor come Sunday.’ After arriving in these shores on Monday morning, quarterback Derek Carr spoke of the oddities of the international series. Oakland Raiders players prepare for a drill during training in Surrey on Wednesday . Quarterback Derek Carr is struggling to get his head around the time difference . ‘It’s crazy. I texted my wife this morning and she was still on Tuesday. I was texting her goodnight and she said “good morning”. It was weird. At the same time, the first day I got here, I tried to fight sleep as long as I could. I think I slept for like 11 hours that first day because I was trying to get caught up to this time zone. 'Obviously, still feeling it a little bit today. As the days have gone, it’s gotten progressively better. The faster I can get into the right time zone, which is here, the better it will feel. I’m glad we came out as early as we did because it definitely makes a difference.’ Devoid of two starters - wide receiver Rod Streater and safety Tyvon Branch suffered foot injuries during the agonising 16-9 defeat at New England - the Raiders know they need to win. And fast. Oakland Raiders brought their cheerleaders with them to London ahead of their Wembley clash . ‘That’s all I care about,’ said rookie quarterback Carr. ‘I’ve told you guys that I’ll throw five touchdowns or five picks, I could care less. I just want to win. That’s all this game is about. That’s all that matters in the NFL. I learned that quick. ‘As we saw last week, we score a touchdown, it gets taken away. We’re going in there, who knows what could have happened after that. It’s just that much. You learn how hard it is to win in this league and you learn how hard it is to get that first one. David Haye was presented with his own personalised Raiders shirt by Menelik Watson . 'That’s what I’m learning right now, how much it really takes to get one win, let alone 16, something that New England has done before. Hopefully we’ll get it this week. I don’t make any promises, I can tell you that.’ And Carr spoke in glowing terms of the explosive Cameron Wake. ‘I can go on and on on their whole defense. They have so much talent. Cameron Wake is obviously a great player. You have to know… when you turn the film on, you’re like “oh my goodness, who is 91?” It’s one of those guys. You’ve got to know where he’s at at all times.’ Khali Mack (left) is hoping for an improved performance against Miami Dolphins at the weekend . Meanwhile Khalil Mack, the fifth overall pick of May’s draft, was succinct about the Raiders’ fortunes so far. Asked to summarise his tender three-game NFL career, he replied: ‘Gotta get better, gotta get better, gotta get better.’ Like many, this is the linebacker’s first trip to England, with the 22-year-old replying: ‘It’s great. It’s different. I’m glad to be here and it’s a different experience for me. I’m glad to be blessed to have this opportunity.’ Oakland Raiders have been preparing for the showdown at Pennyhill Park in Surrey . They face an inconsistent Dolphins side, who have a rookie offensive line and concerns about Ryan Tannehill at quarterback. But their defense is a force to be reckoned with, as Allen alluded to. ‘It’s a good football team. Defensively, they’re fast. They’re aggressive. They do some different things. They like to pressure the quarterback. 'They’ve done a great job of getting pressure on the quarterback so we’ve got to understand what they’re trying to do. Their front four is outstanding as far as getting pressure on the quarterback. We’ve got to take care of the front four.’","The Raiders are 0-3 and face the Dolphins at Wembley on Sunday .

"The man who invented the vanishing spray that has been used at the World Cup said UEFA will use it in the Champions League for the first time next season - and hopes it will be adopted in the Premier League. The foam has been used by referees at free-kicks to make sure defensive walls do not encroach on the 10-yard gap - it lasts around a minute before it disappears. Thin white line Vanishing spray to mark out free-kicks has been used at the World Cup . Heine Allegmagne worked with a company to concoct the spray from vegetable oil derivatives and it was used for the first time in a competitive match in Belo Horizonte in 2000. He has obtained the international patent for the firm. It was adopted widely in Brazil and Argentina and was used in 18,000 games in numerous competitions before being passed by the International FA Board in 2012 as being permitted for use in any country. The Premier League is expected to discuss with clubs whether to introduce it after being given a report from its referees chief Mike Riley. In the air: The Premier League is expected to discuss with clubs whether to use it . Allegmagne, speaking in Belo Horizonte ahead of the Brazil v Germany semi-final, said: 'It's already been agreed that UEFA will use this in their championships. 'Some people have been conservative but I hope that people around the world, including the Premier League, will be impressed by what they have seen in this World Cup. Allegmagne, who is from Minais Gerais - the state in which Belo Horizonte is located - said the spray costs around Â£3 per can. He has provided 320 to FIFA for the World Cup in Brazil. In action: The spray stops defensive walls from encroaching too far forward . He added: 'The Eureka moment came when I was listening to the radio and the commentator was talking about the wall not staying back. It came to me I could do something. 'I wanted to solve a technical problem that had been plaguing football for more than a century. 'The big historic moment came in 2000 when the spray was first used here in Belo Horizonte.' Allegmagne first called the spray Spuni before he teamed up with an Argentinian, Pablo Silva, to improve it. The new version was renamed 9.15 Fair Play - a reference to the wall having to be 9.15metres (10 yards) from the free-kick.","Vanishing spray has been hugely successful during the World Cup .

But after an injury-plagued rookie season, Raiders head coach Dennis Allen is satisfied with his progress. After all, he’s only been playing the game since 2011. ‘I think, the one thing we have to remember is that Menelik is still a young player. He doesn’t have a lot of football experience. He’s still relatively young to the game,’ Allen said at the Raiders’ Pennyhill Park base. ‘I’m not in any way disappointed as far as where he’s at.

Like I said, earlier in the year and throughout training camp, I like the depth on the offensive line. I think we’ve got several guys that can go in there and play and help us be effective as an offense. “We’re going to continue to use Menelik. We’ve used him in some jumbo tight end situations and we’ll continue to do that. We’ll see how he continues to come along.’ And Watson is determined to take his chance when it comes up. ‘At the end of the day, the situation is what it is. My job right now is to help us win football games. That’s the bottom line. We made strides as an offense in the preseason. Unfortunately, I strained my hip flexor and my groin, and that’s how this league works – next man up.

He managed to spend some precious time with his six-year-old daughter Orellana, who lives with his mother, and positively beamed while retelling the tale. ‘I got to pick her up from school and give her a hug and a kiss. It was her birthday Saturday, so I took her into town and spoiled her a bit. She got a little emotional when I was leaving. But I get to see her this weekend, so it’s not that bad.’ And if the Raiders secure their first win of the season, Watson and his team-mates will be smiling all the way home.","The Raiders play the Dolphins at Wembley on Sunday, desperately seeking their first win of the season .

"Ray Rice has spoken a day after having his contract terminated by the Baltimore Ravens. The Super Bowl-winning running back also received an indefinite suspension from the NFL after CCTV footage was posted online of him striking his then-fiancee (and now wife) in an Atlantic City casino. 'I have to be strong for my wife,' Rice told ESPN's Josina Anderson. 'She is so strong. We are in good spirits. We have a lot of people praying for us and we'll continue to support each other. I have to be there for (Janay) and my family right now and work through this.' VIDEO: Watch Ray Rice knock out his then fiancee when he punches her in a lift .

Hurt: Janay Rice's Instagram post in which she reacts angrily to the media . Released: Baltimore Ravens tweeted on Monday that Ray Rice's contract has been terminated by the club . Rice then handed the phone to Janay Rice, who added: 'I love my husband. I support him... I want people to respect our privacy in this family matter.' The sickening footage has sent shockwaves through the sport. Rice's initial two-game ban by Baltimore was widely ridiculed when reports emerged of the incident. A police report described him as having caused 'bodily injury to Janay Palmer, specifically by striking her with his hand, rendering her unconscious.' A Ravens spokesperson insisted that the team was not aware of the footage, and labelled it 'a game changer'. Calm before the storm: The couple are seen arguing in the lift in Atlantic City . Shocking: Rice punches his then fiancee in the face with his left hand, knocking her out . Out cold: Palmer was dragged from the lift after it stopped and Rice was later arrested . The footage, released by TMZ, shows Rice appearing to strike his beau before she hits him back. He then seems to lash out at his then-fiancee, knocking her to the floor and into a railing. As she lies motionless on the floor, Rice drags her body into the casino lobby where a security guard attends to the matter. The NFL's online shop removed Rice jerseys on, and the Ravens announced they will offer an exchange at official team stores.

"NFL release statement in support of 24-year-old . The All-American defensive end set to be picked in 2014 Draft in May . Michael Sam could become the NFL’s first openly homosexual player, after revealing he is gay. The All-American defensive end from Missouri revealed the news in interviews with ESPN and the New York Times. Sam said his team-mates and coaches have known since August. ‘I am an openly, proud gay man,’ the 24-year-old said. Happy: Michael Sam has revealed he is openly-gay ahead of his probable introduction to the NFL in 2014 . The 255-pound Sam participated in the Senior Bowl in Alabama last month after leading the SEC - America’s best college conference - in sacks (11.5) and tackles for loss (19). The SEC’s defensive player of the year, Sam and is eligible for May’s draft and is projected to be a mid-round pick. ‘It's a big deal. No one has done this before. And it's kind of a nervous process, but I know what I want to be ... I want to be a football player in the NFL,’ he said. ‘We admire Michael Sam's honesty and courage,’ the NFL said in statement. ‘Michael is a football player. Any player with ability and determination can succeed in the NFL. We look forward to welcoming and supporting Michael Sam in 2014.’ Sam said many people at the college all-star game for NFL prospects seemed to know that he was gay. One to watch: Missouri defensive Sam end is in line to be picked in May's draft . Support: The NFL released a statement backing the Missouri Tigers man . ‘I didn't realise how many people actually knew, and I was afraid that someone would tell or leak something out about me,’ he told ESPN. ‘I want to own my truth. No one else should tell my story but me.’ Before coming out to all his teammates and coaches, Sam said he told a few close friends and dated another Missouri athlete who was not a football player. ‘Coaches just wanted to know a little about ourselves, our majors, where we're from, and something that no one knows about you,’ Sam said. ‘And I used that opportunity just to tell them that I was gay. And their reaction was like: “Michael Sam finally told us”.’ Respect: Sam has also received support from his coach and team-mates . Missouri coach Gary Pinkel said in a statement: ‘Michael is a great example of just how important it is to be respectful of others, he's taught a lot of people here first-hand that it doesn't matter what your background is, or your personal orientation, we're all on the same team and we all support each other. ‘If Michael doesn't have the support of his teammates like he did this past year, I don't think there's any way he has the type of season he put together.’ Missouri linebacker Donovan Bonner has been a teammate of Sam's for five years. Coming out: Former Leeds United soccer player Robbie Rogers announced he was gay last year as did NBA player Jason Collins . ‘We knew of his status for 5 years and not one team member, coach, or staff member said anything says a lot about our family atmosphere,’ Bonner tweeted. Many NFL players have come out after the conclusion of their careers, including Kwame Harris and Dave Kopay. Last year, NBA player Jason Collins announced he was gay after the season. Collins was a free agent and has not signed with a new team this season. Former Leeds United soccer player Robbie Rogers also came out a year ago.","NFL release statement in support of 24-year-old .

"As Andrew Luck prepares for his third NFL season, he finds himself being mentioned in same breath as Peyton Manning, Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers and Drew Brees. And just to increase the hype, Indianapolis’ past meets the present at Mile High as the Colts face the Denver Broncos. It is Luck’s lot to endure constant comparisons with Manning. Following in famous footsteps: Andrew Luck has had constant comparisons with Peyton Manning throughout his NFL career . After all, both are the offspring of NFL quarterbacks, Heisman runners-up and were taken by the Colts as the first overall draft pick. ‘If you are a fan of the NFL I am sure the storyline is intriguing,’ Luck says. ‘I know from my perspective I don’t have to worry about Peyton Manning, I have to worry about the Denver Broncos defense and it is a darn good one. I am sure it’s a fun storyline for the fans and media to get around.’ As Luck prepares to take his career to the next level, he can reflect on a successful sophomore season. On the way to winning the AFC South, the Colts inflicted a first defeat on Manning’s Broncos and found a way to outscore eventual champions Seattle. In the post-season, he orchestrated the second biggest play-off comeback in NFL history against the Chiefs, but threw seven interceptions in two games. It was another seemingly evergreen quarterback in Brady who ended the Colts’ season and Luck would watch fellow 2012 draft classmate Russell Wilson helping Seattle to stampede the Broncos in February’s Super Bowl. Does he fear a backlash following the one-sided rout? ‘I am not too worried about what their motivation is to come out and play well. I think any professional team is going in to come out and do their best to try to win, I am sure they are not happy about losing the Super Bowl but they are a great team still and I am sure they will play very hard.’ On the rise: Luck has 22 victories under his belt in his first two NFL seasons . With that in mind, what has Luck been addressing to help him and the Colts make the next leap?’ A big focus this offseason has been understanding situational football better. Third downs in the red zone in particular and figuring out how to get better in the red zone. ‘We need more touchdowns, can’t settle for field goal and definitely can’t turn the ball over – and how to convert third downs at a higher success rate. Offensively if we can do those I think we will be able to take the next step. ‘I know as quarterback a big part of that is understanding the situation and understanding how the defense change or adapt and what we need to do to be successful.’ The last time the Colts faced the Broncos, Robert Mathis was inspired, taking two sacks and a forced fumble. But he is suspended for four games after violating the NFL’s substance abuse policy. But the Broncos are missing key players too: both receiver Wes Welker and Pro Bowl kicker Matt Prater are serving four-game bans. And another hurdle for the Colts to overcome is the racket generated by Denver's fanatical fans. ‘We have had the speakers cranked up in practice to mimic the crowd noise every day. It is great preparation for how to handle communication. How you hand-check and audible at the line of scrimmage. ‘It will be a challenge but we will be prepared to handle that and as a player it is fun to play in a hostile environment, there is a little bit of a buzz in the air.’ And you suspect that buzz will be deafening if Luck gets the better of Manning again.","Luck led the Colts to victory over Manning's Broncos last season .

"The Chicago Bears have suspended and fined Martellus Bennett after he slammed rookie cornerback Kyle Fuller into the turf in training camp. Bennett reacted furiously to Fuller's high hit after he attempted to strip the ball, rearing up and piledriving the 22-year-old. The veteran tight end had to be restrained by several team-mates, among them wide receiver Brandon Marshall. Head coach Marc Trestman cut the practice ten minutes short to try to take the heat out of the situation. Feisty: Martellus Bennett looks set to be fined a week's wages and could miss a month . 'I come to training camp for one reason and that's to prepare to win a championship,' Bennett said. 'I play hard and go hard every single day. I'm probably one of the most violent people on the field. That's just my style of play. I'm going to continue to play the same way I always play. That's what I'm here for. 'Everybody talks about friendships, but really we are all preparing to win a championship. If we make friends along the way, cool. But I'm just trying to help the Bears win a championship and do the job to the best of my ability. Prize asset: Big things are expected of Kyle Fuller . 'It's practice. Practice is practice. I know I sound like Allen Iverson right now, but it's practice. (Expletive) happens at practice. You learn from it. That's why it's practice,' he told ESPN. General manager Phil Emery announced that Bennett has been fined and suspended 'for conduct detrimental to the team'. Team-mates and coaches have noted Bennett's lackadaisical attitude to training, with his poor work ethic regularly slowing down the tempo, according to the Chicago Tribune. After joining from the New York Giants last season on a $20.4million four-year deal, the veteran contributed to the NFC's highest scoring offense, and the second-highest scoring in Bears history. Facing over 90% of snaps, he caught 65 passes for 679 yards and five touchdowns. Big things are expected of Fuller, who was taken at No 14 in May's draft, and is expected to start in the nickel package alongside veterans Charles Tillman and Tim Jennings. The Bears, who have not made the playoffs since 2010, begin their season when the Buffalo Bills travel to Soldier Field on September 7.","Bennett slammed the first-round pick into the ground after a face mask .

"Jadeveon Clowney, the first overall pick in May’s draft, left the Houston Texans’ season-opener against the Washington Redskins with a knee injury. Clowney looked distraught as he left the field, but the Texans managed an impressive 17-6 win - ending a 14-game losing streak stretching back to last September. After his opening NFL game, Texans coach Bill O’Brien was cautiously optimistic, saying: ‘Looks like he’s gonna be OK. He may miss some time, he may not. We don’t know yet.’ Anxious moments: Jadeveon Clowney limped off in the second quarter of his NFL bow . Nightmare scenario: Clowney heads for the tunnel as he leaves the field injured . Before sustaining the injury in the second quarter, Clowney had one tackle for a loss of nine yards. In pre-season, Clowney had surgery for a sports hernia in June and missed two weeks after a concussion sustained during a joint practice session with the Denver Broncos last month. The Texans’ victory owed much to the heroics of an inspired JJ Watt. Rewarded with with a bumper deal in summer, the All-Pro defensive tackle sacked quarterback Robert Griffin III once, had three tackles (two for loss), a blocked extra point, a batted pass and a fumble recovery.","The No 1 draft pick left in the second quarter with a knee injury .

"Super Bowls aren’t supposed to be like this. Billed as the classic battle between the NFL’s finest offense and defense, the Seattle Seahawks annihilated the Denver Broncos on both sides of the ball to win the franchise’s first Vince Lombardi Trophy. Peyton Manning’s Denver were dissected, dismantled and destroyed by the brutal, relentless assault. It was as one-sided as the 43-8 scoreline suggests. Men against boys. VIDEO   See below for dramatic highlights from the Seattle Seahawks' Super Bowl triumph . Leader: Russell Wilson was brilliant in Seattle's dominating win over the Denver Broncos . Winners! Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll lifts the Vince Lombardi trophy after a brilliant win . Disappointment: Peyton Manning holds his head in his hand after a shocking defeat at Super Bowl XLVIII . Drenched: Carroll is covered in juice by his players - a tradition in American sports . Read all about it: Media surround Russell Wilson as his team-mates hold up Monday's newspapers . Ticker tape: Players and fans are showered with ticker tape at the end of the game . MVP: Malcolm Smith was named the game's Most Valuable Player . Debate will rage on the future of the recently-crowned five-time MVP after another failure on the biggest stage. That is for another day, but the 37-year old now has a Super Bowl record of 1-2 after Chris Clemons, Cliff Avril and Co hurried and hassled him all night. But all the focus should be on Pete Carroll’s magnificent Seattle. No player on the roster had played at a Super Bowl before, but the self-styled Legion of Boom enacted the classic way to win championships: a mean, nasty defense which unsettles and suffocates opponents, thriving on pressure and creating turnovers. They forced four turnovers, and both of Manning’s interceptions resulted in touchdowns. Super Bowl MVP Malcolm Smith returned an interception for 69 yards and was part of a pass rush that made Manning give his best impression of a cat on a hot tin roof. He also recovered a fumble and made nine tackles. Near perfect: Russell Wilson was brilliant in Seattle's victory . Worst start: The Broncos gave up a safety in the very first play of the game after a botched snap . Picked off: Kam Chancellor intercepts Manning's wayward pass . Pick six: Malcolm Smith returned an interception for a 69-yard touchdown . Beast mode: Marshawn Lynch is handed the ball and makes his way into the endzone for a touchdown . And Russell Wilson, in just his second NFL season, was outstanding, protecting the ball, scrambling in his trademark style and targeting his underrated receiving corps on the move. Percy Harvin, who had played just two games during an injury-hit season, scampered for a kick-off return and made multiple vital receptions. Marshawn Lynch, spearhead of Seattle’s bruising running game, managed just 39 yards. But as the Broncos focused on stopping him down the centre, Wilson utitilised his receiving corps. Doug Baldwin, the explosive Percy Harvin and Jermaine Kearse were all targeted as the Seahawks relentlessly advanced downfield. Seattle’s sensational shutdown corner Richard Sherman, so vocal before the game, had a quiet night. And his evening ended in unceremonious fashion with an ankle injury. It mattered not. The margin of victory was the greatest for 21 years, but it still failed to do Seattle’s dominance justice. They were unstoppable, reducing Denver’s fabled offense - the best in history, remember - to broken men. They didn’t reach the end zone until the game had a quarter left. Huge return: Percy Harvin returned the second half kick-off for a touchdown to dampen Broncos hopes . Disbelief: Manning can't believe how the game unfolded . Bullied: Jermaine Kearse broke four tackles on his way to a touchdown . Perhaps we should have known it wasn’t the Broncos’ night after just 12 seconds. Trindon Holliday’s poor return from Steven Haushka’s kick-off put them on their 14-yard line. A miscommunication saw center Manny Ramirez snapping the ball while Manning was not in position, his face contorting in horror as the ball sailed over his head. Knowshon Moreno helplessly scrambled backwards but he could not avoid the flying Avril in the end zone. For the second time in three years the first Super Bowl score was a safety. The misery conned to pile on Manning. His offensive line, so effective this season, was suddenly porous he failed to get so much as a first down in the first quarter. And when he get the ball in his hands, he didn’t have it for long. Kam Chancellor intercepted his high pass and another sweeping Seattle drive - kept alive by a pass interference penalty from Tony Carter - resulted in a trademark burst over the line from Lynch from a yard. Desperately for time on the field, Denver needed a sustained drive but they didn’t get one. Avril made mincemeat out of right tackle Orlando Franklin and charged into Manning’s right arm. Face palm: Wilson hands off veteran cornerback Champ Bailey . All over: Doug Baldiwn dives for the touchdown after more missed tackles from the Broncos . The ball spiralled into the grateful arms of Smith, who darted to the endzone. With the score at 22-0, the half-time crooning of Bruno Mars couldn’t come quickly enough for the Broncos. But as the Red Hot Chili Peppers blasted out Give It Away Now, Denver did so again immediately after the break. With the 12th man in full voice, Seattle managed to score 12 seconds into second half now as the turbo-heeled Harvin skipped through for a breathtaking 87-yard touchdown. With Carroll furiously encouraging on the sidelines, the Seahawks continued to run up the score. After a magnificent catch, Kearse avoided multiple woeful tackles to skip over for a 23-yard touchdown reception. Demaryius Thomas ensured the Broncos would not suffer the ultimate ignominy by being the first team to end a Super Bowl scoreless, collecting a 14-yard pass from Manning. Wes Welker, whose Super Bowl misery continued, completed the two-point conversion. Again, Seattle were relentless. Baldwin, who skinned multiple Pro Bowler Champ Bailey all night, caught Wilson’s 10-yard pass to complete the rout. Astonishingly, Denver set two records with Manning usurping Tom Brady with 33 completions in a Super Bowl. Thomas collected 13 passes, beating team-mate Welker. But that will mean nothing to a franchise - and a quarterback - who were humiliated by opponents who could be on the way to establishing a dynasty of their own.

"Gonzalo Higuain may be able to take some of the burden off Lionel Messi's shoulders after his man-of-the-match performance saw Argentina through to their first World Cup semi-final for 24 years. Higuain played his best match of the tournament in the 1-0 quarter-final win over Belgium - scoring the goal, hitting the crossbar and threatening on a number of other occasions. It was a timely response, especially as some critics such as Diego Maradona had been questioning his value to the team and highlighting the fact the Napoli striker had yet to score. Rocket: Argentina striker Gonzalo Higuain (right) scores the winner against Belgium in their quarter-final . Confident: Higuain (right) , pictured here celebrating his goal, insists he was sure he'd score in Brazil . Higuain had been a doubt for the tournament as a whole after picking up an ankle injury playing club football in Italy. The 26-year-old told reporters after the game: 'It's not been an easy situation for me. I very nearly didn't make it to the World Cup at all, but fortunately everything has worked out and I've been able to get that goal. 'People been asking me since the first day of the tournament when the goal was going to come and I've always given them the same answer: 'I'm working on it'. 'But I wasn't getting desperate - I knew I was going to get a goal sooner or later. 'Obviously I'm very happy, especially with this being such a historically important win for Argentina.' Higuain's performance against Belgium showed he has suffered no ill-effects from the injury, not least with one fabulous run from the halfway line which saw him nutmeg Vincent Kompany before striking a fierce shot which clipped the crossbar.

"When the Atlanta Falcons take the field at Wembley Stadium for their game on Sunday against the Detroit Lions they’ll hope to have homefield advantage despite being about 4,200 miles away from the Georgia Dome. For the second game of the 2014 National Football League International Series they will play ‘host’ to the Lions on Sunday afternoon. Atlanta (2-5) are very much the underdog with only one victory away from the Georgia Dome in the past two seasons. The Falcons have lost four in a row after winning two of their first three games. Meanwhile, the favoured Lions (5-2) have won their last two road games and are on the back of a two-game winning streak. Roddy White and Mike Smith attend a Play 60 event in Hertfordshire ahead of Sunday's game at Wembley . Calvin Johnson has been struggling with an ankle injury and may miss out on Wembley . The Lions and Falcons have played 35 times overall, including their first-ever meeting in 1966, and Detroit has won the lion’s share of the match-ups with 23 victories. However, Atlanta has won the last three meetings between the teams and outscored Detroit by a combined margin of 88 to 55. The tables might be turned on Sunday as the Falcons have struggled to score points this season under the leadership of head coach Mike Smith. This is the seventh season the 55-year-old has been on the sidelines for the Falcons and he has a 62-41 record overall. However, Smith has only won a single playoff game in four postseason appearances and there have been rumblings that his job is on the line. A win on Sunday against the NFC North leaders would certainly help his cause. Smith may be in luck because Detroit All-Pro wide receiver Calvin Johnson is uncertain to suit up on Sunday. Johnson, who holds the NFL record for most receiving yards in a season with 1,964, has been dealing with an ankle issue and has missed the past two games. If Johnson is unable to go, it will be a big break for Atlanta’s defense, a unit that has already surrendered 1,921 passing yards this year, second-most in the NFL. When the teams take the field for London’s first daytime NFL game it will be 9.30am Eastern time in the US. The early start time in the States means fans can watch the NFL morning, noon and night in four separate Sunday timeslots. Although the Sunday morning kickoff may interfere with breakfast plans in Atlanta and Detroit, the earlier start is not expected to affect attendance and the Lions and Falcons will likely be playing in front of a packed house. Matt Ryan is second in the passing yards list, but Atlanta's season has been hamstrung by inconsistency . The Detroit Lions' offensive line has been a low point in an otherwise solid season . The first NFL match-up at Wembley in 2014, which saw the Miami Dolphins trounce the Oakland Raiders 38-14, was played in front of 83,436 fans.

"Black and white issue: A Chinese scientist claims fossils prove prehistoric man ate giant pandas . They are large, cuddly and the most gentle of creatures - but in prehistoric times, Giant Pandas were just another source of food to primitive man. A Chinese scientist has claimed humans once included panda meat in their diet after uncovering fossils that show the animals died from wounds caused by hunters. Wei Guangbiao said an examination of excavated fossils in the southwest Chinese city of Chongqing showed pandas had been ""slashed to death by man"". He said prehistoric man would not have killed animals that would have been of use to them in the daily battle for survival. Pandas, then in plentiful numbers, would have been a ready source of food and a good complement to a diet that consisted mostly of berries and anything else they could trap or catch. Given their shy nature, and slow, lumbering walk, the bears would have been easy prey for hunters armed with sticks and stones, and later spears and knives. The distinctive white and black fur of the panda would also have been used by primitive man to provide warmth. Guiangbiao, head of the Institute of Three Gorges Paleoanthropology at a Chongqing museum, said the pandas who lived 10,000 to one million years ago were much smaller than those seen in captivity and the wild today. He told the Chongqing Morning Post newspaper the pandas would have been found in the city’s high mountains. Here they flourished in their natural habitat of cool, wet and cloudy mountain forest land, which is rich in bamboo. Historians believe panda meat was once a delicacy eaten by the rulers of Ancient China. Today, the Giant Panda has been on the endangered species list for more than 50 years and is called a “National Treasure” in China, where there are breeding centres tasked with helping to boost the dwindling population. Latest figures show there are 239 Pandas living in captivity, while the wild population is said to number under 3,000. Gentle giants: These panda cubs are among many born at breeding centres around China to help boost the dwindling population .","Chinese scientist claims fossils prove pandas were eaten by primitive man as part of their diet .

"Rare shots of hyenas hunting buffalos, bathing hippos and a solitary giraffe on the plains of the Serengeti have been captured using a homemade helicopter drone. British wildlife photographer Will Burrard-Lucas designed the BeetleCopter so he could get up close and personal with the animals without scaring them off, or endangering his life. He previously designed the Beetlecam, a hidden camera that can be driven across the region, but created the drone to take unique aerial shots. Scroll down for video . The remote-controlled BeetleCopter, pictured, is powered by six mini-rotors. It is capable of flying for up to 15 minutes at a time and the Serengeti footage was taken on a GoPro camera. Burrard-Lucas, pictured in the background, was able to control the copter from up to a kilometre away via a live video feed .

Burrard-Lucas is originally from Sevenoaks in Kent but currently lives in Tanzania. His remote-controlled device is powered by six mini-rotors and capable of flying for about 15 minutes at a time. The camera is attached to a stabilised gimbal - a support that pivots on a single axis - suspended under the body of copter. The 30-year-old spent five months from August 2013 building and learning to fly the BeetleCopter before taking it out from a spin in the Serengeti in Tanzania. His footage was recorded over a two-week period and was shot on a GoPro Hero 3+. Burrard-Lucas was able to control the copter from up to a kilometre away using a live video feed and remote screen. He also used virtual-reality goggles ‘like a computer game’ to immerse himself in the shoot. A close up aerial shot of a hyena with a dead buffalo in the Serengeti. British wildlife photographer Will Burrard-Lucas spent five months building a homemade drone fitted with a camera to record these images during two weeks in Tanzania last year . ‘These devices have incredible potential in wildlife filmmaking and photography,’ explained Burrard-Lucas. ‘They are much smaller and quieter than a full-blown helicopter so you can get really close to the wildlife without spooking them.' During his filming he captured sweeping images of migrating wildebeest and antelope as well as more intimate shots of giraffes and hippos. The drone was able to capture this sweeping image of a herd of migrating wildebeest, pictured, as it travelled from Tanzania on its way to the Masai Mara . The BeetleCopter was also able to capture this image of a solitary giraffe. Burrard-Lucas said he designed the drone so he could get up close and personal with the animals without 'spooking them'. He added its perfect because its 'quiet and easily manoeuvrable' An aerial shot of hippos bathing in the Grumeti River. Burrard-Lucas has built a total of eight BeetleCopters, capable of carrying everything from a lightweight GoPro camera, to a full-sized DSLR camera, and is building further models for fellow wildlife photographers and videographers . 'There is quite a lot of excitement about the possibilities,’ he continued. ‘I have really only scratched the surface.’ But development has been far from plain sailing after Burrard-Lucas 'wrote-off' his BeetleCopter by ploughing it into a tree during testing. He said: ‘It took a while to get a hang of them. You need have a fair bit of practice before you can start filming, especially when dealing with longer ranges when you can't really see the copter because it is so far away. 'The animals also react differently to . it. Larger animals don't really see things in the air as a threat . because their predators are land-based. The hyena in the video was . really relaxed and only leaned in to sniff it briefly. ‘But I think something like a meerkat would be very spooked by it.’ Other shots captured by the BeetleCopter include this aerial view of a herd of elephants. The photographer claimed larger animals weren't fazed by the drone because they don't see objects in the air as a threat. This is because their predators are usually land-based . By using a GoPro camera, Burrard-Lucas's shots had a spherical appearance, such as this sweeping image of antelopes. The camera was also lightweight enough to make the drone capable of flying for longer distances and using less battery power. There are 91 species of antelope, most of which are native to Africa . Burrard-Lucas, who studied physics at university, made his name with the BeetleCam, a remote-control land-based camera. He now owns a fleet of eight BeetleCopters, capable of carrying a everything from a GoPro to a full-sized DSLR camera, and is building further models for fellow wildlife photographers and videographers. He hopes to use his fleet of BeetleCopters to capture more amazing pictures and video across Africa. He added: ‘It is such a different perspective and people have been amazed by the results. My focus now is to further minimise the sound so that I can get closer to animals without disturbing them.’ The name of the Serengeti, pictured, comes from the Masai language of Maa. The term Serengit' means 'endless plains'. It is one of seven Natural Wonders of Africa and is home to around 70 mammals and 500 bird species .

"The hapless selfie-taking tourist who has become an internet sensation over footage of him being kicked in the head by a Peruvian train driver could be set to earn a substantial fortune from his recent misfortune. Jared Frank, from Regina, Saskatchewan, has been offered thousands of dollars of advertising and licensing opportunities from media companies keen to take advantage of his hilarious video which has already attracted more than 23 million YouTube views. On Monday, Frank, 22, signed with a California-based representative called Jukin Media, who has told him his video could earn in the range of $2 to $16 per 1,000 views and he can expect a 70 per cent share of the profits.

There is also a potential for additional revenues from licensing agreements. 'I'm a little worried, but I have a decent relationship with the licensing company, so I trust them,' he said on Monday. 'I did a lot of research first.' Frank plans to use his earnings to pay for his recent trip to Peru and also to go to film school.

"World Cup winning rugby star Mike Tindall turned out for an amateur rugby club in Devon on Saturday, two months after retiring from the professional game. Tindall, who was part of the backline when England famously won the Rugby World Cup in 2003, turned up at North Tawton RFC in Devon to be part of their coaching staff. Insurance company QBE ran a nationwide competition to award four amateur clubs with a 'hit squad coach', and North Tawton were one of the winners. World cup winner Mike Tindall dolls out words of wisdom to the North Tawton players . Tindall watches on from the sidelines . The England legend was taking part in a QBE initiative aiming to support the development of rugby at all levels . But little did the club, players and thrilled spectators know Tindall had brought his boots and he joined the action for the second half. Tindall said: 'Since retiring I have been biting to get back on the pitch. 'I didn't come here expecting to be involved in a playing sense but the players and coaches were keen on the idea.' North Tawton, of the Devon Tribute 2 division, beat Crediton 26-17 in a pre-season friendly. Tindall set up two of the tries and the crowd were treated to some trademark bursting runs and crunching hit. The 35-year-old first linked up with North Tawton back in February but has kept in close contact with the club. Tindall gets stuck in at a ruck . The centre sets off on one of his trademark bursts from deep . Tindall showed his new North Tawton team-mates how it's done on the pitch as well . He turned up on Saturday to manage the pre-match drills, team talk and tactical substitutions but even the players were surprised when he jogged onto the pitch halfway through proceedings. Former Gloucester centre Tindall called time on a glittering career in July, which yielded 75 England caps. North Tawton prop Alfie May said: 'Some of the boys read a tweet that Mike sent to Richard Wigglesworth saying that he was hoping to play for North Tawton but we didn't read too much into it. 'Mike has offered us so much of his time coaching on both the sidelines and on the pitch and it was just amazing seeing him play in our home kit.

"The Pittsburgh Steelers needed less than three minutes to score 24 unanswered points in the second-quarter to help them beat the Houston Texans 30-23 on Monday. A mixture of trick plays and improbable bounces jolted Pittsburgh from a 13-0 deficit to a 24-13 lead in a span of 2:54, which erased an ugly start for the home side, who had been initially booed by their own fans. 'We fought through some adversity,' Pittsburgh quarter Ben Roethlisberger told reporters after he threw for 265 yards and two touchdowns.

Steelers wide receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey (right) is brought down by the Texans' Danieal Manning (left) 'You dont expect to score that many points that fast. It was crazy.' Wide receiver Antonio Brown also threw for a surprise touchdown while Le'Veon Bell added 145 total yards and a receiving score. Arian Foster rushed for 102 yards and had a receiving touchdown for Houston but also had a costly fumble as the Texans were plagued by three turnovers. Pro Bowl defensive lineman J.J. Watt dominated early for the Texans with a sack and a fumble recovery, but his team never recovered from Pittsburgh's second-quarter outburst. 'We can't allow 24 points in (three minutes),' Watt said. If we can stop shooting ourselves in the foot I think well be alright.' Pittsburgh's spark began when Roethlisberger lofted a 35-yard pass to Martavis Bryant, who made the first catch of his NFL career to pull the Steelers to 13-10. On the Texans' next possession, Foster fumbled to give the home side the ball at the Houston three-yard line. Defensive end Brett Keisel (centre) runs beyond Adrian Foster (left) after intercepting a pass . Texans star Alfred Blue (right) is congratulated by team-mate C.J.

On Houston's next play from scrimmage, defensive end Brett Keisel tipped a pass from QB Ryan Fitzpatrick and intercepted it after it ricocheted off Foster. It resulted in a two-yard scoring connection from Roethlisberger to Bell that gave the Steelers their 24-13 halftime cushion. Shaun Suisham kicked two of his three field goals in the second half to put the Steelers ahead 30-16 with about three minutes left. Houston responded with a drive and a one-yard touchdown pass to Foster, but they could not recover their final onside kick attempt.

"A bionic hand which allows the recipient to feel ‘lifelike’ sensations is to be transplanted on to a patient’s arm for the first time. Until now, artificial limbs have been able to pick up brain signals destined for the absent hand and translate them into movements, but they could not give sensory feedback. The new hand, which is attached directly to the nervous system via electrodes clipped on to two of the arm’s main nerves, aims to restore a sense of touch in amputees. Scientists hope the new bionic hand will prove to be a breakthrough in the development of artificial limbs . The bionic hand is attached directly to the central nervous system meaning it can be controlled directly by the recipient . Developers say it will be the first prosthetic to provide real-time sensory feedback . The electrodes will allow the . recipient to control the hand using just their thoughts – and will also . send signals back to the brain. Scientists hope the breakthrough will . pave the way  for a new generation of artificial limbs that more closely . imitate real body parts by providing feeling and increased dexterity. An Italian medical team aims to transplant the bionic hand to a patient in Rome later this year . Studies have shown that up to half of . hand amputees do not use their artificial limb because they are not . comfortable with how it appears or functions. Dr Silvestro Micera, of the . Swiss-based Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, who helped develop . the limb’s interface, said: ‘This is real hope for amputees. It will be . the first prosthetic that will provide real-time sensory feedback for . grasping. ‘It is clear that the more sensory . feeling an amputee has, the more likely they will get full acceptance of . that limb. We hope that one day it will be embedded in the arm and the . user will just forget it is there.’ In 2009 an earlier, fixed model of . the hand was temporarily attached to a patient’s nervous system via . electrodes. He was able to wiggle the fingers of the robotic hand, make a . fist and hold objects, and said he could feel needles being jabbed into . the palm. The new model, which will be fully . attached to the arm, can deliver sensory feedback from all the . fingertips, as well as the thumb, palm and wrist. The team plans to . transplant it into an anonymous patient later this year. Dr Micera, who was attending  the . American Association for the Advancement of Science’s conference in . Boston, said: ‘The idea would be that it could deliver two  or more . sensations at one time. ‘You could have a pinch and receive information from three fingers, or feel movement in the hand and wrist. ‘We have refined the interface, so . we hope to see much more detailed movement and control of the hand. It . is intended to be as lifelike as possible.’ Speaking at the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) annual conference in Boston, he said the team plans to transplant the new hand into an anonymous patient in Rome later this year. The only details known about the recipient is that they are in their 20s and have lost the lower part of their arm following an accident. The only details known of the first bionic hand recipient is that they are in the their 20s and lost the lower part of their arm following an accident . It . will be worn for a month to see how the patient adapts, but if all goes . well, Dr Micera hopes to have a fully-working model ready for testing . within two years. Scientists from the EPFL also offered fresh hope for patients paralysed as a result of back injuries. Last . year, a team led by Gregoire Courtine enabled rats with severed spines . to run again, using a cocktail of drugs and electrical impulses to . ‘regrow’ nerves linking the spinal cord to the brain. After two weeks, . the animals were not only able to walk, but climb stairs and run. He has since repeated the study in rats with bruised spines, which more closely resembles human trauma patients, and after a few weeks they could walk with no assistance. He now believes that the technique could help people who have been immobile for up to two years. Although full human trials are still a few years off, he plans to attempt electrical stimulation on five patients who have limited leg movement in the coming months. ‘We know that spinal cord stimulation is safe, we know that training is good, so we want to start the first trial in people who can move their legs but cannot walk independently. So we will implant five patients, we have a new technology which allows us to stimulate the spinal cord of humans just like we do in the rats.’ Once they have refined the technique, they hope to fully rehabilitate patients with moderately damaged spines, while others would regain some movement. ‘We already have preliminary data from the rats with these clinically relevant lesions is that a number of them would recover at the end of the training and could walk without any help. It depends on the severity of the damage,’ he said. ‘But if you talk to the patient and you tell them at least you could use it at home to cook, to watch TV and have normal activity, they say their life would be so different. So it is less ambitious, but we are talking about improving the quality of life, allowing people to stand and take a few steps at home with a walker.’","Will give amputees a genuine sense of touch .
