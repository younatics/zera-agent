"Some brides-to-be spend months finding their perfect venue. When you already own a £3million hilltop retreat in the south of France, the task is somewhat easier. Keira Knightley will exchange vows with rock star fiancé James Righton at her picturesque farmhouse, in front of guests including fellow actress Sienna Miller. Loved up: Keira Knightley and James Righton strolling in New York, left, and meeting at the airport ahead of their wedding this weekend, right . The eight-bedroom property, shielded by conifers, sits among 20 acres of vineyards and olive trees near a medieval town in Provence. Neighbours include Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, who own a 17th century manor house nearby. Miss Knightley, 28, flew out to France earlier this week to help her mother, playwright Sharman Macdonald, with preparations for the ceremony. Miss Macdonald was seen directing operations in the grounds of the house yesterday. It is thought the party will be an intimate affair, with fewer than 50 of the couple’s closest friends and family expected to join them for the weekend. Yesterday bunting and a large red hammock could be seen in the garden, while a large white marquee with two peaks poked out above the tree line. Ready for the big day: A marquee could be seen above the tree line at Miss Knightley's £3million farmhouse in Provence yesterday . The couple have employed a catering team for the reception and 120 bottles of wine, at a cost of around £3,000, have been sourced from local vineyard Chateau Minuty. Entertainment will, naturally, be provided by the fellow members of 29-year-old Righton’s band, Klaxons. One guest told the Daily Mail: ‘It’s a beautiful location for the wedding. They’re very, very lucky. It’s just the perfect time of year for it as well, they couldn’t have picked a better weekend weather-wise.’ Miss Knightley reportedly asked guests to arrive separately to avoid attracting attention. Last month she told a magazine: ‘We’re not big-wedding types. I don’t need to have all that.’ While the couple will exchange vows today, because of French law they will not be husband and wife officially until they have signed the register in Britain, which is expected to take place next week.","Couple will exchange vows at actress's picturesque farmhouse this weekend .

"Glasgow's emphatic support for Scotland's unsuccessful independence movement may have had a detrimental impact on tourism there, at least in the short term. As interest from potential visitors significantly rose in the country's other major cities following the surprisingly comfortable referendum margin in favour of pro-union voters, the same cannot be said for Scotland's most populous city which was strongly in favour of leaving the United Kingdom. Travel interest for Inverness, Edinburgh and Aberdeen increased markedly on Friday compared to the previous Friday, when Scotland's future remained uncertain and polls predicted a tight vote. Scroll down for video . Renewed interest: After overall interest in Scotland dropped, cities such as Inverness are popular again . Searches on travel site Trivago for for accommodation in the next two months have risen by 33 per cent for Inverness, 27 per cent for Edinburgh and 10 per cent for Aberdeen since last week. Conversely, site searches for accommodation in Glasgow increased by just two per cent from the Friday before. 'This is hardly surprising considering the strength of the ""yes"" vote there,' said Trivago's Denise Bartlett. 'Perhaps it will take a little longer for travellers to feel comfortable visiting Glasgow again.' In the week leading up to the vote interest on the site for Scotland as a tourist destination had plummeted by 29 per cent year-on-year as travellers awaited the outcome of the referendum. 'This definitely indicates an increase in travel interest from the rest of the UK to Scotland,' Bartlett said. 'Hopefully this indicates a return to normality for Scottish tourism, as it would be a shame for the country to suffer and unfortunate for visitors to miss out on everything Scotland has to offer.' High on the hill: Searches for Edinburgh have risen 27 per cent on the website Trivago last week . On the up: Castlegate in the city centre of Aberdeen, for which accommodation searches have risen 10% . Before the referendum there were  reports of visitors from outside Scotland cancelling holidays due to the perception of anti-English feeling in the country. But when asked if the 'no' vote would have any impact, positive or negative, on visitors choosing to go to Scotland from south of the border VisitScotland's spokeswoman gave a simple: 'No'. 'We are not aware of cancellations - people come to Scotland because of the friendly people, the landscapes, cities and amazing events and will continue to do so,' the spokeswoman said. With the referendum over, Scottish tourism can now focus on the Ryder Cup golf tournament between Europe and the United States set for Gleneagles in Perthshire.","Interest has skyrocketed for Scotland's Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Inverness .

"Miss Wesson, whose labour was two weeks early, has two other children . It is no doubt fairly common for children to be conceived at Glastonbury. The newborn daughter of festival fanatics Heidi Wesson and Sean Crothers, however, is one of the very few to have been born on the famous fields. In a dramatic labour late on Saturday evening - possibly induced by The Rolling Stones’s Satisfaction - Miss Wesson gave birth to a healthy daughter, supported by her partner and the close friends with whom they had been partying. Music to her ears: Heidi Wesson (pictured with her one-year-old daughter Eadie) gave birth to another daughter at Glastonbury over the weekend . Heidi Wesson and partner  Sean Crothers with their one year-old daughter Eadie and Heidi's son Connor from a previous relationship. Heidi gave birth to a second baby girl for Sean last night at Glastonbury Festival . Miss Wesson, 33, from Leicester, later spoke of her joy at giving birth at the famous music festival, saying mother and baby were ‘fine and fabulous’. Miss Wesson, whose labour was two weeks early, has two other children - Connor, ten, and Eadie, 11 months. The young mother, who works in customer services at Next, gave birth to her newborn, who has yet to be named, at 3am on Sunday morning at the medical centre on site at Glastonbury. They are now recovering at a nearby hospital. Miss Wesson’s mother Sandra last night said she warned her daughter not to go to the music festival while so heavily pregnant but she insisted she always gave birth late so it would not be a problem. Her son Connor said he is disappointed his sister was born at Glastonbury because he ‘did not want her to be a hippy baby’. Heidi's mother Sandra Wesson. She said she warned her daughter not to go to the music festival while so heavily pregnant . Last night a spokesman for Glastonbury said that both mother and baby were doing well.He added: ‘We’d like to send our congratulations to the family. We look forward to welcoming them back in future years. ‘We’ve had babies born here that are now grown-ups. They still come every year. That’s a beautiful thing.’ After news spread about what happened among friends, Miss Wesson went online to assure them she was OK. ‘Thanks to everyone for looking after us,’ she wrote on Facebook. ‘We are over the moon and a little shattered ;-) xxx ps: sorry for interrupting your night off Nana bloody love you xxx.’ The keen music fan, who is a regular at Glastonbury, already has a young daughter named Eadie, but it is not thought she was with them at the time. She was eight months pregnant when she gave birth early - a shock to those who were with her. Tracy Harrison, who helped deliver the baby, said it was ‘not quite what I expected’. She added: ‘Just helped deliver a beautiful daughter for Heidi Wesson and Sean. Thank you for waiting til nanna got there.... Lindsey Harrison thank you for been there x x x love you all x x x very much a Glastonbury baby x x.’ Earlier, friends and family used social networking sites to spread news about the birth. Holleh Alyce Weston wrote: ‘Absolutely amazed that Heidi Wesson and Sean Crothers have had their baby at Glastonbury!! Congratulations.’ Rebs Morris-Richardson added: ‘Am absolutely chuffed to pieces for Heidi Wesson and Sean Crothers on the birth of their baby girl at Glastonbury, welcome little one and congratulations, whoop whoop,xx.’ Cousin Terry Albone added that Miss Wesson was the ‘only woman I know who, when eight months pregnant, would go to Glastonbury in that condition’. Miss Wesson gave birth to a healthy daughter, supported by her partner (both pictured) and the close friends with whom they had been partying . It is believed Ms Wesson went into labour during a set by the Rolling Stones . He also joked: ‘Good job they were in a caravan.’ There were, however, conflicting reports about where exactly the child was born. Fran Gale wrote on Twitter: ‘As if my cousin’s best mate gave birth in the middle of Glastonbury field!’ A woman is last known to have gone into labour at Glastonbury three years ago. First-time mother Victoria Iremonger, 30, wanted to have her baby at the festival site but medics insisted that an ambulance was called and she was taken to nearby Yeovil Hospital. She eventually gave birth to a healthy baby boy, Reuben, before returning to the festival the next day with the child and her partner Evan Jenkins, 31. Last night, a spokesman for the festival would only say that mother and daughter were healthy and recovering well. Huge numbers: An estimated 180,000 people attended Britain's largest music festival .","Heidi Wesson gave birth, supported by her partner Sean Crothers .

"On the ice, they formed a sizzling partnership – but they were always quick to deny that the heat between them continued off the ice. However, Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean have now confirmed the suspicions of millions of fans by admitting that they did have a fling. After years of speculation, the pair have revealed they ‘dabbled’ when they were teenagers, several years before they shot to fame dancing the Bolero and winning gold at the 1984 Winter Olympics. Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean told interviewer Piers Morgan that they had 'a little dabble once' as teenagers . Nine years after their short fling, the skating duo took gold at the 1984 Sarajevo Winter Olympics with their performance to Ravel's Bolero . Torvill and Dean, pictured in 1981, had previously denied romance between them on the grounds it would ruin their skating partnership . They finally confessed to the brief romance in an interview with chat show host Piers Morgan for his ITV1 Life Stories programme. After shooting the show, the presenter wrote on Twitter: ‘BREAKING NEWS: “Yes, we dabbled...” – @torvillanddean finally admit to a romantic past together, albeit a very short one.’ According to one member of the audience, the pair attempted to deny they had ever been romantically involved following persistent questioning by Morgan. However, it was Dean who finally relented during Wednesday night’s filming, saying that nothing had happened – ‘apart from a  little dabble once’. He explained that it happened when they were teenagers, shortly after they began skating together as amateurs in 1975, when Dean was 16 and Torvill was 17. Nine years later, the duo went on to win gold for Britain for their performance to Ravel’s Bolero in Sarajevo. They scored 12 out of 18 possible sixes for their free dance and the maximum of nine sixes for artistic impression. Miss Torvill, 55, and Dean, 54, previously denied ever allowing romance to blossom between them. Dean's first wife Isabelle Duchesnay found his close friendship with Torvill too much to bear . Dean was married to Canadian skater Isabelle Duchesnay between 1991 and 1993 . The Dancing on Ice pair were pictured in Lillehammer, Norway with Dean's second wife Jill Trenary, left, and Miss Torvill's husband Phil Christensen . In an interview to be broadcast next month, Torvill and Dean look back on their long partnership, including their gold medal winning performance in Sarajevo . Dean began dating fellow Dancing on Ice mentor Karen Barber shortly after his split from second wife Jill Trenary . Two years ago, Miss Torvill claimed they banned themselves from jumping into bed together because they feared it would damage their skating partnership. She said: ‘We decided very early on that if we had slept together we couldn’t have skated. ‘I remember somebody saying to me, “If you’re dating your skating partner and the relationship breaks down, you won’t have your skating partner”.’ The pair retired from professional skating in 1998. Dean has said previously: ‘We put to one side all those other elements that we thought would conflict with what we needed to do. That’s how obsessed it was. It was almost like being in a monastery. It was a religion in its own way.’ But they have admitted in  the past their close friendship often caused problems with their partners. Dean’s first wife, fellow skater Isabelle Duchesnay, to whom he was married for two years between 1991 and 1993, found his friendship with Miss Torvill too much to bear. He said: ‘She used to say there were three people in our marriage.’ After the couple split, Dean went on to marry former US figure skater Jill Trenary, with whom he had two children, Jack and Sam. However, . the pair broke up in 2009 after 16 years of marriage and Dean began . dating Dancing on Ice judge and former Olympic skater Karen Barber . shortly after. The ice skating pair, pictured in 1982, retired from professional skating in 1998 before enjoying joint success mentors on ITV's Dancing on Ice . The couple grew close when they became mentors, alongside Miss Torvill, on the ITV dance contest in 2006. Miss Torvill has been happily married to US sound engineer Phil Christensen for 23 years and the couple have two children Kieran, ten, and Jessica, six.

"Picture this: dapper looking gentlemen donning waistcoats, bow ties and impeccably groomed moustaches riding through town on classic motorcycles. Add to the mix tailored suits, crisp shirts, monocles, and riding goggles plus genteel ladyfolk sporting elegant dresses and it may just sound like a scene from Mad Men. However this isn't the 1900s, but The Distinguished Gentlemen's Ride, where participants dress up to the nines in the their finest vintage attire and coast around the roads on retro or custom bikes. The Distinguished Gentleman's Ride took place across the world on September 28, and riders in Sydney enjoyed a warm and sunny spring day for the event . 'Café Racers, Bobbers, Classics, Flat Trackers, Scramblers and quirky, undefinable two-wheeled machines' are all welcome at the ride according to The Distinguished Gentlemen's website. These dapper gentlemen took part in the Zurich ride . Men and women across the world donned their finest tailored suits and trimmed their moustaches for the ride, and these lucky participants had the backdrop of Sydney harbour behind them . Some little motorbike enthusiasts also took part in the ride in Sal Paulo, Brazil at the weekend . This gentleman from Taunton in Somerset, England, donned some very fancy glasses and a smoking pipe for the annual event . The annual event has one key aim, besides looking impeccable atop a stunning bike with a lovely dame or gent in the side car of a motorbike. 'Our focus is on gentlemen who are dealt a tough hand in life. In particular, we raise funds for research into prostate cancer as part of our mission to support men’s health,' The Distinguished Gentlemen's Ride's (DGR) website states. 'For one day a year ... thousands of Distinguished Gentleman (and genteel ladyfolk) in hundreds of cities worldwide press their cravats, starch their tweed and sit astride their classic-styled motorcycles to raise funds for prostate cancer research and awareness. Jun Song took part in the ride all the way from Salt Lake City in Utah, USA . Romanian men in the city of Bucharest jumped on their favourite two-wheeled vehicles and donned their finest pinstripe suit jackets . Brazilians in Sao Paulo dressed up to the nines to take part in the ride that isn't just for a good cause, it's about people having a good time in even better clothing . In Syracuse, New York, riders had some impressive bikes and patritotic headwear on display during the ride . Dashing dames  in New York donned their best riding boots and formal ties to jump aboard their classic motorcycles . 'It’s a day all about spreading merriment while raising awareness of a really important issue,' the DGR site also revealed. For the past few years, the ride has grown to huge proportions worldwide and at the weekend it was held in over 50 countries. Starting in 2012 with just 2,500 riders taking part across 64 cities, the ride has grew exponentially to more than 10,000 participants across over 100 cities in 2013. And 2014 was even bigger, with the charity raising more than $1.6 million for prostate cancer across the globe. In Salt Lake City a smaller group took part but still managed to raise funds and awareness about the disease . Tens of thousands of people took part in the event across 258 cities in 57 countries such as this gentleman in Nijmegen in the Netherlands . More than $1.6 million was raised by all those who took part and contributed to the cause in 2014 . X-Factor's Red Foo (left) took part in the Sydney leg of the ride, in an unusual take on vintage with his leopard print jacket . Lovely ladies also hit the road for the event looking dashing in vintage helmets, sunglasses, and a modern twist on the traditional suit . This year 258 rides were taken across 57 countries by tens of thousands of dapper gents and lovely ladies looking to raise much needed funds for prostate cancer research. The ride was inspired by a man named Bruce who was unexpectedly struck down by prostate cancer. His passion is motorbikes, and in his story shared on the DGR. The disease runs in his family, and Bruce even rode his bike to the doctor the day he received his devastating diagnosis. Sydneysiders got to enjoy the spectacular city views including the Opera House during the event . Ronan Keating and Red Foo were out supporting the cause at the weekend . 'Motorcycles are my therapy, so it made sense to ride my good old Trumpy to Perth the next week to get my results. Nothing like a ride after bad news, I always say,' he wrote. Bruce shares his whole story in a touching and brutally honest post about his battle during and well after he had surgery to remove his prostate. But the advice he gives at the end is the most crucial, and some he wants every gentleman to follow. 'So, lads, have you got balls? Prove it. Go get tested. Today.'","The Distinguished Gentleman's Ride takes place at the end of September each year .

"When her culinary skills surprisingly let her down, Ruby Tandoh found a new ingredient for the Great British Bake Off judges – a flood of tears. She appeared inconsolable after making basic errors during Tuesday’s semi-final. With tears rolling down her cheeks, the 21-year-old philosophy student clearly feared she was for the chop. And whether it was the shock of messing up or a bid for sympathy, it worked. Just add water: Ruby Tandoh bursts into tears as she awaits her fate before Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry . She was spared by the judges, who put her through to next week’s final, kicking out 31-year-old Beca Lyne-Pirkis instead. However Miss Tandoh’s performance won little sympathy from viewers, many of whom have already claimed that judge Paul Hollywood favours the attractive former model. On Twitter, many criticised her weepy performance and suggested she survived only because the judges felt sorry for her. Lorenzo Cibrario wrote: ‘I really just can’t stand Ruby. Stop crying all the time.’ Beth Sykes added: ‘I swear Ruby has spent most of her time crying instead of baking.’ Cry me a river: Ruby gets a helping hand to wipe the tears from her face when a task does not go to plan . A third tweeted: ‘Poor, poor judging – poor Beca so deserves a place – complete farce that Ruby is through to the final’. Another described a spat with Hollywood over her decision to use saffron in one recipe as like ‘a lovers tiff’. This week’s challenges required the four contestants to make savoury canapés, a charlotte royale dessert and an opera cake. Miss Tandoh’s canapés were praised, with Mary Berry saying the pastry was ‘beautifully cooked’, but her charlotte royale came last and her chocolate, almond praline and saffron opera cake ‘didn’t have the finish’ the judges wanted although it ‘tasted good’. Falling flat: Ruby failed to get the height needed for the technical challenge . Made it through:  Ruby was reduced to tears yet again when she found out she was in the finals . They were left unimpressed by  Mrs Lyne-Pirkis’s ‘unmemorable’ canapés, although her charlotte royal beat Miss Tandoh’s. She then made a banoffee-flavoured opera cake, which scored well on presentation but poorly on flavour, meaning she missed out on a place in the final. Bookmakers have now made Miss Tandoh the favourite to beat the other two finalists, Kimberley Wilson and Frances Quinn, next week. Bake Off will move to BBC1 next year after attracting BBC2’s best audience this year with an average of seven million.","Student and ex-model through to the final of the Great British Bake Off .

"Household favourite: Glove puppet Sooty is set to return to TV screens at the age of 65 . The first generation of children to laugh at Sooty’s pranks are now drawing their pensions. But 65 years after he was created, the classic glove puppet is still working as hard as ever – and is about to start a new Sunday morning kids’ TV series. Despite being on air almost continuously since the 1950s, The Sooty Show is still a TV favourite because children are bored of watching TV shows that ‘preach’ and ‘moralise’, its latest boss has claimed. Richard Cadell, who took over Sooty and his sidekicks Sweep and Soo in 1999, said the teddy bear’s mischievous character appeals to toddlers who are bored by more ‘health and safety conscious’ shows. The 44-year-old said: ‘Sooty has a niche. It works because of the old fashioned slapstick humour. The gunk and the custard pies. Most children’s programmes nowadays are very health and safety conscious. ‘We get away with stuff others can’t. Sooty is naughty and impolite. It is like Tom and Jerry. 'And while other shows are worried about setting a good example to the young, we just want to make children scream with laughter. I’m not trying to preach or moralise. There is too much of that. Children get bored of that.’ Sooty’s character was first created by Harry Corbett in 1948, after he bought an old glove puppet for 7s 6d (37.5p) at a novelty shop in Blackpool. After making his TV debut in 1952, The Sooty Show went on to become the longest running children’s TV show ever. Harry’s son Matthew took over the act in 1975 before eventually handing the baton over to Mr Cadell. Classic: Richard Cadell, who took over Sooty and his sidekicks Soo and Sweep in 1999, believes the character will never get outdated . Entertaining: Mr Cadell says modern children's programmes are too 'health and safety conscious' After a TV production company made a disastrous attempt to turn Sooty into a cartoon animation, Mr Cadell bought the rights for £700,000 and has brought it back to mainstream TV. In September, a new series of shows will air at 9.10am on Sunday mornings on ITV1 and CITV. Recent series have regularly drawn in more than 50,000 young viewers per episode. Matthew Corbett – who still regularly speaks to Mr Cadell about the show - said his father loved the character so much he would drill airholes in the box he was kept in while travelling. Saying Sooty could go on ‘forever’, he added: ‘I think the reason for Sooty’s success is the simplicity of it, especially in an era where so much television is computer-generated.’ Mr Cadell agreed, saying: ‘Children . don’t mind that you can sometimes see a piece of string or someone’s . arm. They know Sooty is not real, but they still want to stroke him and . say hello when I do live shows. We do it all very frugally, and that is . part of the charm. Sooty's character was first created by Harry Corbett in 1948, after he bought an old glove puppet for 7s 6d at a novelty shop in Blackpool . After making his TV debut in 1952, Sooty went on to have the longest running children's TV show ever . ‘It is a classic old double act, with Sweep as the slightly foolish sidekick who always gets the blame. It was inspired by Laurel and Hardy originally. Soo is the serious older sister. Lots of children can relate to that.’ Mr Cadell revealed there have been more than 6,000 Sooty puppets in total, used in both the live theatre shows and the TV programmes. He said: ‘Sooty gets up to so much mischief he does get worn out. I go through almost one puppet every episode. We refer to them as stunt doubles, because the character of Sooty never dies. ‘I still mourn the passing of each puppet though. Each one is subtly different. Sometimes one eye will by slightly off, giving him a mischievous squint. We donate the old ones to charity, or auction them for good causes. People often claim they have the original Sooty, but there are so many, nobody can be sure.’","Glove puppet has been entertaining children since 1952 .

"As the daughter of a multi-millionaire rock star, she grew up in luxury properties in some of the world’s most desirable locations. But as a newlywed, Jade Jagger, daughter of Rolling Stone Mick, has named a housing association flat that would normally be occupied by a tenant from a council waiting list as her home. Priority for such properties is also more likely to be given to the homeless, disabled and those in  low-paid jobs. Scroll down for video . Wedding day: Jade Jagger, seen at her wedding to DJ Adrian Fillary last year, has named a housing association flat as her home, despite having grown up in luxury properties in far-flung destinations . However for Sir Mick’s second daughter it has become her new home after tying the knot with DJ Adrian Fillary last year. Jewellery designer Miss Jagger, 41, has listed the one-bedroom central London apartment, which is rented by her husband for just £120 a week, as her place of residence on documents filed with Companies House. The newlyweds registered the address when they set up their firm 71Ltd in October last year. The property, underneath the Oxo Tower restaurant on the south bank of the Thames, is one of 78 flats leased by Redwood Housing to struggling residents who are deemed to be ‘in housing need’. Half the tenants come from council waiting lists. Housing association: The one-bedroom central London apartment underneath the Oxo Tower restaurant is one of 78 leased to struggling residents deemed to be 'in housing need' By contrast, Sir Mick, who is reported to be worth £200million, owns a string of exclusive properties around the world, including a 17th century mansion in Chelsea bought for £10million in 2006, a Georgian mansion on Richmond Hill, South West London, bought for £2.5million in 1993, a 16th century chateau in the Loire valley, a £1.5million Paris apartment, and a villa on the private Caribbean island of Mustique bought for £2million in 2006. While Miss Jagger would not be eligible for a housing association property, it is understood that her husband satisfied Redwood’s strict criteria when he moved in 13 years ago. Rock royalty: Miss Jagger's father, Sir Mick Jagger, owns a string of properties around the world; from a 17th Century Chelsea mansion to a villa on the Caribbean island of Mustique . Despite his marriage to Miss Jagger, he has continued to rent the property. Miss Jagger has two daughters, Assisi, 20, and Amba, 17, from her relationship with artist Piers Jackson. She married Fillary, 41, who began working as a DJ in the early Nineties before going on to work as a nightclub promoter, in a lavish wedding in June last year. Miss Jagger has insisted in the past that she has never wanted to live off her father’s money, saying: . ‘I’m not a trust-fund child. I think my father’s got a healthy work ethic and, therefore, I think it just came with the part. You’ve got to look after yourself. ‘It probably came more so from having kids and wanting to support them and look after them and give them the best I could.’ A spokesman for the Coin Street Housing Co-operative, which owns the flats, said marrying a wealthy partner would not affect a tenant’s eligibility to continue renting the property if it remained their main residence. Accounts at Companies House show the designer’s jewellery business made £133,924 last year. In February 2010, she sold her North London townhouse for £1.36million. She still owns a £3million farmhouse in Ibiza, where she is understood to spend most of her time, and a £300,000 beachfront home in Goa. A spokesman for Miss Jagger said: ‘While Adrian had lived at the Oxo Tower as a single man for over ten years, now he is recently married, he is currently actively looking to buy a house in the area and move out. ‘Although he is not contravening any rules or regulations, he has informed both the Co-op’s independent managing agent and the Co-op’s own management committee of his intentions to move out in the near future, as a matter of courtesy and in the spirit of co-operative living.’ Miss Jagger is Sir Mick’s second daughter, from his marriage to model Bianca De Macias. He has six other children with three further women – 42-year-old Karis from his relationship with Marsha Hunt, Lizzie, 28, James, 27, Georgia May, 21 and Gabriel, 15, all from his marriage to model Jerry Hall, and a 13-year-old son, Lucas, with Brazilian model Luciana Morad.

'It abounds with delightful details and allusions, from the rounded Toron handles and red calf-hair back panel, to the brass corners inspired by House trunks and the metal Siamoise ornament that is so Louboutin,' its description reads. And a collection featuring the term 'icon' wouldn't be complete without participation from Chanel legend Karl Lagerfeld. The eccentric designer has crafted a five-piece range themed around boxing, with chain-strapped totes starting at $3,400 and a 'price upon application' life-sized trunk; one of only 25 made. '[Mr Lagerfeld's] Boxing Trunk is fitted with a signature punching bag and stand, while a separate suitcase, also in Monogram, holds boxing gloves and a mat. 'With its capacious interior and removable shelving, the trunk can also serve as a chic travel closet.' Definitely worth the money then.","The bag was designed by Rei Kawakubo for Louis Vuitton's new Iconoclasts collection .

"British model Heather McCartney has revealed that she stripped off in a corporate box during the AFL Grand Final between Hawthorn and the Sydney Swans as part of a bet. The Scottish 26-year-old took off her clothes in front of thousands of Australian rules football fans at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Saturday - with the subsequent pictures causing a storm on social media. After receiving complaints, police arrived to arrest her - but she lashed out, kicking, punching and biting the officers as they tried to handcuff her. Her team, Hawthorn, won back-to-back flags for the first time since 1988/89, with a 63-point win over Sydney. Scroll down for video . Tom Steinfort tweeted a photo of Heather McCartney, naked in a corporate box at the MCG, captioning the snap: 'Celebrating your team winning the grand final by getting nude in a corporate box... priceless' Heather McCartney (left) donning a Hawthorn scarf before she danced naked in full view (right) of strangers during the game's final quarter at AFL Grand Final . The Gold Coast woman spent the night in a police cell and was fined A$300 for indecent manner. McCartney spoke out after her court appearance on Sunday - and revealed she stripped off for a bet. 'It was a bet. I said if Hawthorn win, I’m getting naked. They won, and I got naked,' she told the Herald Sun. Ms McCartney said she stripped for a bet: 'What a f---ing day, it was great' 'What a f---ing day, it was great.' McCartney posted a raunchy photograph of herself, with her hair in pigtails, wearing just a yellow bikini top and dark bottoms and a red AFL ball in one hand on Monday morning. She captioned: 'What a weekend! Had a blast with my girl. Melbourne.' One man who claimed he was in the box during the stunt said McCartney was hired for the day and was promised double pay if she 'got naked and cheered in front of everyone'. Despite receiving messages of congratulations on Facebook, the incident has angered officials at the MCG,who have launched an investigation. MCC spokesman Shane Brown told the Herald Sun it would work with Victoria Police and the client to establish the circumstances, and appropriate action would be taken. 'From the evidence available, we are very disappointed ... and are taking the matter seriously,' he said. An AFL spokesman said they were also awaiting on information from the MCC regarding the investigating. AFL Fans Association spokesman Brian Clarke told the Herald Sun he was disgusted by the return of the 'blokey culture' to AFL. 'It’s a disgrace. It’s the people’s game and it’s for families,' he said. The model appeared at a Melbourne court after a night in police custody . 'This goes against everything the AFL has been trying to achieve. I hope the AFL come down hard on those who were behind this.' The model was forced to the ground and cuffed in an unknown state of undress. During her arrest, she reportedly yelled ‘f*** off, I don’t have to tell you anything, you f**ing r****d,’ before hitting an officer in the face, the Sun Herald also claims. Images of McCartney cavorting naked in the MCG corporate box have gone viral on social media, with disbelieving onlookers snapped in the background. She was released from Melbourne Remand Centre after a night in custody and appeared in the Melbourne Magistrates Court on Sunday. McCartney was seen leaving court on Sunday morning, holding a clear plastic bag of her belongings, including her clothes, shoes and make up. She was wearing black tights and a dark grey knitted jumper and had no shoes on at the time. The court was told that McCartney was dared to strip naked if Hawthorn won the Grand Final against Swans . McCartney has gained a significant number of followers on her official Facebook fan page 'Miss Lady Darling' after Saturday night's explicit stunt. One Facebook user named Kevin Richardson commented: 'How was your night in the slammer Heather??' Scott Evan said: 'Awesome show yesterday!' Michael Coyte said: 'well done darling' William Divic said: 'Damn didn't recognize you with clothes on' Heather McCartney, a 26-year-old Scottish model is currently living on the Gold Coast . The court was told that she accepted an invitation to attend the corporate box and dared to strip if Hawthorn won. The Hawks (21.11.137) easily claimed the cup over the Sydney Swans (11.8.74). However, there are claims that Ms McCartney was hired to strip, according to Herald Sun. McCartney's lawyer told the court 'she didn’t understand at the time it could lead to police involvement'. The court also heard that alcohol and strong medication for aplastic anaemia had made her unable to control her actions. Magistrate Alan Spillane described her conduct as 'pretty nasty offending.' 'The part I think is really worrying is basically you were biting and hitting out at people who were out trying to do their job.' At 6.15pm police received reports of a naked woman in a corporate box. McCartney pleaded guilty to several charges including an act in an indecent manner. Like MailOnline Sport's Facebook page.

"Three death row inmates were last night scheduled to be executed in America despite a row over the use of untested drugs in lethal injections. The killers are the first scheduled to die since a botched execution in April was caused by an untried cocktail of chemicals. They are due to be put to death in three states over a 24-hour period but authorities are refusing to say where they have obtained the drugs. Campaigners have criticised the secretive process under which officials have got hold of drugs from unnamed, loosely regulated pharmacies after other companies withdrew their supplies. And lawyers for the condemned men say subjecting them to a traumatic ordeal could breach the US constitution’s ban on ‘cruel and unusual punishment’. However, the killings are due to go ahead unless they are given clemency at the last minute. Executions in America had been put on hold following the bungled attempt, a highly unusual break for a country that puts more people to death than any other Western nation. Nine killings were delayed after an inmate eventually died of a heart attack 43 minutes after he was injected with an untested cocktail of drugs in Oklahoma. An investigation later found that prison guards had put the needle into a vein in Clayton Lockett’s groin but failed to notice when it started leaking, even though he moaned and struggled violently on the gurney. In January, an Ohio prison also bungled the death of murderer and rapist Dennis McGuire, 53, after using two drugs normally used in colonoscopies. Marcus Wellons was the first due to die last night in Georgia, followed by John Winfield today in Missouri, although judges have temporarily granted a delay. John Ruthell Henry is set to be put to death tonight in Florida. Death penalty expert Deborah Denno, of Fordham University School of Law, said that after previous botched executions ‘everyone is going to be watching very closely’. Richard Dieter, of the Death Penalty Information Center, said the debate could be a ‘turning point’ over capital punishment as people become ‘disgusted’. Georgia and Missouri plan to use the single drug pentobarbital, a sedative, in executions. Florida uses a combination of midazolam hydrochloride, vecuronium bromide and potassium chloride. Campaigners have challenged the three states’ refusal to divulge where exactly the drugs are from but state courts have ruled the secrecy is legal. Prisons have had to find alternatives after the makers of sodium thiopental, long used in US executions, stopped supplying it for that purpose in 2011 after being targeted by protesters.","Executions the first to go ahead since botched lethal injection left prisoner writhing in agony for 40 minutes before suffering massive heart attack .

"Two men are in police custody after CCTV footage, released by police following an alleged attack on a Sydney train, went viral. Police released the  footage of the men at 2:30pm on Tuesday following an incident in which a Sydney man, identified as Paul, was brutally bashed - and left with a broken nose, two black eyes and 24 stitches for a gash on his head and lip - after stepping in to defend two women. The offenders had been harassing the women, according to police, while returning from an NRL match at Homebush on Saturday before Paul stepped in, in an attempt to bring the situation under control. Scroll down for video . Police released CCTV footage of these two men after the brutal bashing of a Sydney man on a train . Two men have since been arrested following the incident, a 26-year-old and his 28-year-old brother . The Sydney man, Paul, came away from the attack with a broken nose, two black eyes and 24 stitches to a gash on his head and lip . Only two hours after the surveillance images were shared on Facebook, the posts reached over 180,000 viewers and over 1000 shares, according to police. By 4:30pm a 26-year-old man was arrested after turning up at Penrith Police Station. His brother, a 28-year-old man, contacted investigators at Sydney City Local Area Command shortly afterwards and was arrested in his Zetland home. Paul has spoken out about his actions on the train from Sydney Olympic Park to Central after the Penrith-Canterbury semi-final on Saturday, and says his intentions were to prevent any violence from erupting. The 48-year-old was covered in blood after a vicious attack from two men. The culprits fled at Sydney's Central Station, police claim . 'I thought I'd just ask the fellas to leave it alone and walk away, to just quieten everything down,' Paul told 9NEWS. 'There were innocent people on the train and these people were getting quite overheated. 'I didn't want it to escalate to the stage where there was any violence.' Police say one of the men moved to sit down in a different part of the train, but his friend starting throwing punches. 'Loads of punches were being thrown,' Paul said. After an argument had erupted, Paul said he went over to calm things down before the situation got out of control before he was allegedly attacked . Emergency services were called to the scene and paramedics took Paul to St Vincent's Hospital . Police say during the argument one of the men punched a 48-year-old man in the face several times before he was allegedly held back by another man and punched again. It's believed he fought back before other commuters intervened and separated the group as the train approached Central Railway Station. Police allege the two men ran from the train and ran down the stairs to the concourse where they were last seen getting on an esculator and heading towards Chalmers street. Police were patrolling the station at the time of the incident and were able to go to Paul's aid. The two attackers were both wearing Penrith Panther football jerseys during the brutal bashing on Saturday . Paramedics were also called to the scene and went to his aid and he was then taken to St Vincent's hospital where he underwent plastic surgery for a laceration to his lip. He also sustained a broken nose, two black eyes and a laceration to his forehead. 'By the time the train reached Redfern, the 48-year-old man was concerned the conversation had become offensive,' said a NSW Police spokesperson.

"Wallabies star Kurtley Beale has been dropped from the Wallabies side ahead of this Saturday's clash with Argentina, after the rugby player was involved in an alleged verbal altercation with a female staff member. Australia's coach Ewen McKenzie has confirmed that Beale has been left out of the 23-man squad but says the decision was made as a game strategy, for 'team balance' - rather than as disciplinary action after the controversy. Beale has found himself embroiled in more drama and controversy, with the Australian Rugby Union's integrity unit investigating an alleged incident on the team's long-haul journey to Argentina on Sunday. Beale was involved in a verbal altercation with a Wallabies staff member, named by the Sydney Morning Herald as  business manager Di Patston, while travelling from Johannesburg to Sao Paolo the day after the side's 28-10 loss to the Springboks in Cape Town. The event reportedly occurred during a long day of travel, which saw the team first depart Cape Town at 6am to fly to Johannesburg. Next, they boarded South African Airways flight 222 to Sao Paulo, where they waited almost four hours before flying on to their final destination of Buenos Aires. The management staff member returned to Australia on Tuesday of her own accord, from Buenos Aires, two days' later. Wallabies star Kurtley Beale was allegedly involved in a verbal altercation with a female staff member during a flight from Johannesburg to Sao Paolo on Saturday . Wallabies coach Ewen McKenzie missed training on Tuesday afternoon to escort her to the airport but on Wednesday said Beale remained available for selection for Saturday's Rugby Championship clash with the Pumas in Mendoza. Beale's 47-Test career has been dogged by a succession of off-field problems and last year the 25-year-old was forced to undergo counselling and rehabilitation for his struggles with alcohol. McKenzie, though, said the troubled playmaker shouldn't be hung out to dry. 'Obviously we're aware of the history but you deal with every incident as it comes along,' he said. 'And you've got to determine the facts and until we determine that fully, I'm not going to make any more judgment on it.' An ARU spokesperson said they expected the investigation to be completed by the end of next week. It came the day after the Wallabies's 28-10 loss to the Springboks in Cape Town . The Australian Rugby Union's integrity unit investigating an alleged incident . 'The investigation will ensure all parties have an opportunity to present all relevant facts, before any assessment of the alleged incident can be reached,' they said. McKenzie declined to comment on the severity of the allegation or any possible sanctioning, but it's understood the altercation was only verbal. 'We've referred it to the experts,' McKenzie said. 'I mean, obviously there's protocols and things in place.' McKenzie refused to divulge whether alcohol was involved, but the Wallabies have a protocol of no drinking on flights and are only allowed to indulge on the night after a Test match. 'Matters of integrity, you've actually got to protect the people involved until there is some sort of decision,' McKenzie said. Wallabies coach Ewen McKenzie (right) on Wednesday said Beale (left) remained available for selection for Saturday's Rugby Championship clash . Last year the 25-year-old was forced to undergo counselling and rehabilitation for his struggles with alcohol . McKenzie admitted he was aware of the incident soon after it happened, but other dramas - including the delayed arrival of the 42-strong touring party's luggage - had slowed the investigation process. The coach missed Wallabies training in Buenos Aires on Tuesday - their only session so far this week - while dealing with the incident in which he claimed 'there were a number of people involved'. McKenzie conceded the incident was a major distraction ahead of their final Rugby Championship match. 'These things are time-consuming, so I don't pretend that I enjoy the distraction of it,' he said. 'But matters of welfare are critical. Matters of behaviour are critical, too, to team culture. 'So I'm not going to sit here and leave things undone or not attended, so obviously the ARU will take the lead on it but I'll follow it through and make sure things get sorted.'","Wallabies star Kurtley Beale left out of side for clash with Argentina .

"Google is facing a growing backlash over its ‘Glass’ eyewear, with cafe owners in the US banning the technology from their premises. Dave Meinert, who runs the 5 Point Cafe in Seattle, said those wearing the spectacles will have to remove them if they want to come in. He has put up a sign on the wall which reads: ‘Respect our customers’ privacy as we’d expect them to respect yours.’ Invasion of privacy?: Google Glass can film what the wearer sees without any indication to others . The move comes after it emerged . people wearing Google Glass could be banned from American cinemas, . casinos and even parks because owners don’t want filming there. The . glasses, which cost $1,500 a pair (£980), are currently on limited . release to 2,000 customers but will be more widely available later this . year. Should Google glasses be banned in cafes to protect customers' privacy? A camera next to . the wearer’s eye, which can take photos or record video without a red . light or a shutter sound to tell others that it is working, has caused . concerns for privacy. Casinos . said the futuristic eyewear could help cheaters to win unfairly and . cinemas said they could be used to illegally record films and sell . pirate copies. Lap dance clubs said that they would . treat those wearing the Internet-connected specs the same as anyone . caught filming a stripper with a cameraphone - and would kick them out. Behind the lens: Wearers of Google Glass can film as they walk around wearing the technology . Parks departments and banks across . America are also waiting to see how the new technology is used before . deciding whether or not to ban them. Dan Tench, of legal firm Olswang, which is co-ordinating a privacy lawsuit against Google in the UK, said: ‘This is the ultimate snooper’s gizmo. If you walk around with a video camera filming, it’s obvious what you’re doing, but with Google Glass, it’s much, much more invasive.’ Google’s chairman Eric Schmidt once admitted that the aim with such technology was to ‘go right up to the creepy line and not cross it’. But the public clearly feels differently and in France those wearing Google Glass style specs have been subjected to ‘cyber discrimination’. University of Toronto computer engineering professor Steve Mann was at a McDonald’s restaurant in Paris when he claims an employee tried to physically remove a similar gadget he designed from his head.","Cafe owners ban Google Glass over secret filming fears .

"If you’re the type of woman who calms down quickly after a row, congratulations. Your relationship is on solid ground – no matter how long your other half sulks for. According to research, the happiest marriages are those where the wife cools off quickly after a fight, even if her husband stays angry. The secret to wedded bliss? When it comes to keeping the peace, it is more important for wives to calm down after a heated argument than husbands . Scientists . said that women are better at starting those difficult conversations . that will solve the problem and allow both parties to move on – but only . if they have regained their composure first. And ironically, they . found that if the husband attempts to start those conversations himself, . his spouse will criticise him for trying to resolve things too quickly. Lead . author Lian Bloch, an assistant psychology professor at Berkeley and . Stanford universities in the US, said: ‘When it comes to managing . negative emotion during conflict, wives really matter. Emotions such as . anger and contempt can seem very threatening for couples. ‘But our study suggests that if spouses, especially wives, are able to calm themselves, their marriages can continue to thrive.’ The . researchers studied more than 80 middle-aged and older couples by . videotaping them and analysing how they interacted, taking into account . factors including body language, facial expressions, tone of voice and . conversation topics. According to Berkeley College, ‘time and again . they found that marriages in which wives quickly calmed down during . disputes were ultimately shown to be the happiest, both in the short . and long run’. In contrast, the husband’s emotional regulation had . ‘little or no bearing on long-term marital satisfaction’. The . happiest marriages were those in which women used what the researchers . called ‘constructive communication’ to  temper disagreements. Berkeley . College psychologist Robert Levenson, a senior author of the study, . said: ‘When wives  discuss problems and suggest solutions, it helps . couples deal with conflicts. ‘This may not work so well for husbands, whom wives often criticise for leaping into problem-solving mode too quickly.’ The . research was part of the long-term monitoring of 156 heterosexual . couples in California. Every  five years since 1989 they have updated . researchers on how happy their marriages are.

"Men feel more attractive once their partners have given birth, scientists at University of California-Santa Barbara suggest . Women may get a glow during pregnancy, but now it turns out that men feel they are more attractive as well - only after the baby has arrived. In the first study of its kind, men said that their self image improved after the birth in what is being called a ‘hidden benefit’ of becoming a dad. The scientists said that men could get the boost because they feel they they are more masculine having just seen a mini version of themselves enter the world. They could also get a kick out of women cooing over them as they walk around with their baby. Women by contrast did not experience such a lift about their appearance - possibly because the physical demands of raising a child left them a shadow of what they used to be. The study examined 182 people who were all newlywed adults with an average age of 24 for a women and 26 for a man. They asked them to give their verdict on their own wellbeing and appearance at the start of the study, the one year anniversary and the second anniversary. One question asked them to rate how attractive they found themselves on a scale of one to 10 and how ordinary they thought they were on a scale of one to five. For men who didn’t have children, notions of attractiveness remained stable. But those who became fathers during . the study’s timeframe felt more attractive after their child was born . than they did previously. Lead . researcher Alicia Cast, an associate professor the University of . California-Santa Barbara, said: ‘I was talking about this paper with my . husband and he commented on the attention he got when he was seen in . public holding our son after he was born. One theory suggests men feel more masculine having helped create a child in their own image . ‘Like: ""Aren’t you a good dad"", ""Look at that new dad with his baby"".' 'Women get that feedback, too, because everybody loves a new baby. But that (benefit) may be countered by other things she’s experiencing that he’s not, in terms of how her body has changed and being more physically tired. ‘There’s a lot of attention paid to . how women think about themselves – particularly their bodies and their . physical attractiveness – after childbirth. ‘But to our knowledge there’s been nothing that looked at men’. It is a possibility that men feel more attractive because of the attention they get from women when toting a new baby around . Ronald Rohner, professor emeritus of family studies at the University of Connecticut, who was not involved in the research, added that it was an ‘intriguing idea’. He said: ‘Whereas some women experience postpartum depression, some men experience a postpartum glow.’","Scientists at University of California-Santa Barbara discover men's self-image hugely boosted after birth of their baby .

"David Cameron has fallen out of a list of the top ten most powerful people in the world for the first time since he became Prime Minister. Forbes magazine now ranks him less important than Michael Duke, chief executive of Wal-Mart, which owns Asda. Now ranked 11th, having fallen one place, Mr Cameron is derided by the influential US business magazine for ‘a flip-flop approach to green taxes’. Supermarket sweep: David Cameron has dropped out of the top 10 of the Forbes Power list for the first time since becoming Prime Minister, making way for Wal-Mart President and CEO Michael Duke . It . added: ‘The Conservative PM guides the world’s sixth-largest economy . and was once hailed as the second coming of Margaret Thatcher. No more.’ It marks a dramatic drop for Mr Cameron, . who only two years ago was ranked seventh most powerful person in the . world after sweeping in to power. Confirming his position at 11th . on the list, the magazine added: ‘He has recently been criticised for a . flip-flop approach to green taxes after he pledged to slash the tax on . household energy bills amid soaring gas and electricity prices. ‘He has two years to galvanise the Tories ahead of a 2015 general election.’ Top two: Russian President Vladimr Putin is ranked number one most powerful person in the world, while US President Barack Obama is number two .

David Cameron, UK Prime Minister (10) Mr Cameron will also feel uncomfortable that in the 500-word citation, the magazine also notes that he is and ‘Oxford graduate and (illegitimate) descendent of King William IV (1830-1837)’. Three years ago Forbes said Mr Cameron ‘shares the Iron Lady's determination to slash government expenditures’. But since then it has grown increasingly unimpressed with the Tory leader, warning last year how he faced a ‘disillusioned electorate and rumblings from his own party over Britain's future’. By comparison the 2012 Power List notes how Mr Duke is chief of the world's number one retailer and biggest private employer, with 2.2 million workers. It adds: ‘Wal-Mart can make or break a company simply by deciding to stock its product.’ Wal-Mart bought UK supermarket chain Asda in 1999, and it now employees 175,000 people in the UK. Forbes’ annual list, chosen by the influential magazine’s editors, has also . demoted Barack Obama who had been number one every year since he was . elected US president in 2009. He has become a ‘lame duck’, says the . magazine which puts him at number two behind Vladimir Putin despite the . Russian leader’s terrible record on human rights. Michael Noer, . executive editor at Forbes, said: ‘There is a fundamental difference . between a good person and a powerful person. If we were doing a list of . the most palatable people in the world it would be very different.’ Chinese premier Xi Jinping is at number three in the list up from ninth last year, Pope Francis number four, up one, and German chancellor Angela Merkel was the top-placed woman at number five, down from number two in 2012. Microsoft tycoon and philanthropist Bill Gates takes the sixth place, down from fourth, US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke is at number seven down from sixth and Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah is down one at eight and European Central Bank president Mario Draghi down one place at nine. The magazine ranked the 72 people on the list - one for every 100 million people on earth - according to how many people they have power over; the financial resources they control; if they have influence in more than one sphere; and how actively they wield their power to change the world. In the Commons today, Mr Cameron was accused of going from 'Rambo to Bambi' in just four years. Labour leader Ed Miliband claimed David Cameron had once spoken of tough action to make sure household bills fell when wholesale prices dropped. But he claimed the so-called Big Six should now be called the Big Seven because Mr Cameron backed them. Ridicule: The Prime Minister was accused of going from 'Rambo to Bambi' by Labour leader Ed Miliband . Mr Miliband said: 'In opposition, you said there was a problem in the relationship between wholesale and retail prices and you went on to say, the first thing you've got to do is give the regulator the teeth to order those reductions are made. And that is what we would do. 'Why, when it comes to the energy companies, has it gone from Rambo to Bambi in four short years?' But Mr Cameron replied: 'Who was it gave us the Big Six? Yes, when Labour first looked at this there were almost 20 companies but because of your stewardship we ended up with six players. 'You talk about a price freeze but down the corridor, they (Labour) have been voting for a price rise - that is right.

"Tony and Cherie Blair have come under fire after it emerged that their charities have been given nearly £1m from the American government’s foreign aid budget. A US taxpayer watchdog has demanded an investigation because the grant was awarded whilst Mrs Blair’s good friend Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State and would have been responsible for the cash. In December Mrs Blair’s woman’s charity was given a total of £405,000 from the US Agency for International Development (USAID). Details have emerged that Tony and Cherie Blair have received nearly £1million from the American Government's foreign aid budget . The Clintons and Blairs are old friends. Concerns have been raised that their relationship could have had an impact on the grants . The money is on top of the £550,000 that the African Governance Initiative, one of Tony Blair’s charities, was given in 2011. Both Mr and Mrs Blair have denied that their relationship with Mrs Clinton - forged when he was Prime Minister - had anything to do with the awards. But around a month after the money was given to Mrs Blair’s charity Mrs Clinton stepped down from her post ahead of an expected Presidential run in the 2016 US election. A spokesman for the National Taxpayers Union, a US campaign group, said: ‘More oversight and transparency is needed, if not a re-examination of the existence of these programmes. ‘USAID is under the Department of State’s direction and is vulnerable to shifting with the political winds, and has been loose with taxpayer dollars in the past.’ The £405,000 for the Cherie Blair Foundation for Women will go to help women in the African countries of Tanzania, Ghana and Rwanda, according to its latest accounts, which were published last week. The money will supposedly be used for an ‘innovative project’ to launch businesses related to mobile telephones. The grant has swelled the coffers at Mrs Blair’s charity which has an income of £1.8m a year and has £1.5m in the bank. The good fortune marks a turnaround from when she launched it in 2008 and had to put in £250,000 of her own money as a loan. Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State when Mrs Blair's woman's charity was given a total of £405,000. It is said that Mrs Clinton would have been responsible for the cash . Both Mr and Mrs Blair have denied that their relationship with Mrs Clinton - forged when he was Prime Minister - had anything to do with the awards. A spokesman for the charity said: ‘The Cherie Blair Foundation for Women followed exactly the same application process as any other organisation applying for a grant from USAID.' Dr Maura O'Neill, USAID chief innovation officer, added: ‘USAID knew that if the world is to lift more people out of poverty so they could have a prosperous, healthy and just life, women are key. ‘We partnered with the foundation to close this gender-access gap and spur the growth of female entrepreneurs using mobile technologies.’ The development comes as Mrs Clinton has come under fire in recent weeks over her handling of the Benghazi scandal. The row is over the death of US Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens, who died along with three other Americans when the Libyan embassy was stormed by militants. The Obama administration initially claimed the attack was spontaneous and as a result of a protest but Republicans claim this was a cover-up because of inadequate security and that they knew all along it was terrorism.","Cherie Blair's charity given £405,000 from US when Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State .

"The man who found the video that shows Mitt Romney making embarrassing gaffes is the grandson of former President Jimmy Carter. James Carter put reporters from the left leaning U.S. website Mother Jones in touch with an unnamed individual who had shot the footage. He said that he had been researching films on Republicans 'almost every day' and that he did it 'just for fun.' Scroll down to watch the video . Mission: The video was posted online by the Mother Jones website with the help of James Carter (pictured) grandson of former president Jimmy Carter . Gaffe: In the video, Romney argues that '47 per cent' of Americans would vote for Obama 'no matter what' because they were 'victims dependent on government' Leaked: James Carter, an opposition researcher, said he found the video online and put reporters from the left-leaning U.S. website Mother Jones in touch with an unnamed individual who had shot the footage . Blunder: The resulting outcry is still regarded as one of the main reasons why the Republican lost the race to the White House . James Carter is also unemployed and admitted that he hopes his newfound fame could help him get a job. The disclosure that he was involved is likely to fuel speculation that the project to embarrass Romney was part of a liberal stitch up. Jimmy Carter ran on the Democratic ticket during his one term as President between 1977 and 1981. James Carter's father is Graydon Carter, editor of Vanity Fair magazine which is known for its left-leaning political views. Plan: Marc Leder hosted the $50,000-a-plate fundraiser where Mr Romney made his much-criticised remarks in May. He has reportedly helped organise another fundraiser for the Republican campaign this Saturday . Explaining himself: Romney appeared on Fox New Channel on Tuesday to talk about the Mother Jones video . Facts: Romney has statistics on his side when it comes to the 47 per cent comment - only 53 per cent of Americans pay federal income tax after deductions and rebates . James Carter said that when he found the clip weeks ago there was an 'uproar' on Twitter so he hunted down the person behind it and contacted them on the microblogging site. He then contacted David Corn at Mother Jones and put the two in touch. For his efforts, James Carter was given the credit of 'research assistant' on the finished product. He said: 'Anytime that you can find a clip that strengthens the narrative already established, that’s what becomes a big deal. 'I've been trying to get paid for this, but it hasn’t worked out yet. This might help.' Watch video here .","James Carter found video after researching films on Republicans 'almost every day'

"Apple has dramatically cut component orders for the iPhone 5 amid weaker than expected demand for the device. The California-based tech giant has reportedly slashed the number of screens it wanted in half and reduced orders on other parts too. Apple is said to have have told its suppliers about the change last month. It will apply to orders from now until the end of March. Shares of the company dropped . dramatically on Monday on news of the sales drop. Apple stock dropped . $18.55 a share, or 3.57 percent. Apple has dramatically cut component orders for the iPhone 5 amid weaker than expected demand for the device, slashing the number of screens it wanted in half . Falling: Apple stock hit its lowest level in 11 months on Monday over claims of and iPhone sales slump . Samsung's flagship Galaxy S3 has sold  40 million units worldwide - just two months after hitting 30 million. The firm said is has now sold 100 million Galaxy S series devices. Samsung said, 'The driving force behind Samsung Electronics' rise to the top on the global smartphone market is Galaxy S II which is gaining ground as a steady seller hitting the sales of over 40 million in only 20 months.' The stock closed at $501.75 - the lowest level it has hit been since February 2012. The sales claim is one of the most concrete signs so far that the iPhone 5 has not been the hit that Apple hoped. It comes after Apple has come under intense pressure from Samsung and other phones which use Google’s Android operating system. Samsung’s share of the global smartphone market rose to 31.3% in the third quarter of 2012, compared to 8.8% in the same period in 2010. Apple’s slice meanwhile fell from 14.6% down from a high of 23% at the start of last year. According to the Wall St Journal, Apple may have made particularly large orders of iPhone 5 parts because it was concerned about the quality. By over ordering they would ensure there were enough replacements to keep customers happy. When the iPhone launched there were also concerns the three screen supplies - Sharp, Japan Display and LG Display - might not be able to keep up with demand, so Apple could have been stockpiling. Last month Apple stocks were lowered by from Neutral to Buy by analysts at Citigroup. In a report on December 16, it said: ‘It is unlikely that Apple is cutting orders in a 'great' demand environment’. The cuts to components of the iPhone 5 (pictured) comes after Apple has come under intense pressure from Samsung and other phones which use Google¿s Android operating system . Other analysts have said Apple shares could plunge another 20 per cent amid fears it has run out of ideas. Many feel that after the death of its founder Steve Jobs, it is just a matter of time before it runs out of steam. Since Jobs’ death Apple has made some rare missteps that almost certainly would not have happened were he still alive. Its chief executive Tim Cook admitted the company ‘screwed up’ with the its new maps service which was not as clear as Google Maps and missed out entire areas. It also launched the iPad Mini even though Jobs specifically said before his death that Apple should never do so. Another challenger to Apple is Chinese phone giant Huawei which sells cheaper smartphones and is now making inroads in countries such as the UK. Apple’s stock price starkly illustrates the challenge it faces - it peaked at $705.07 in September but closed on Friday at $520.30. Meanwhile, South Korea-based Samsung is expected to report that 2012 was its best year ever with profits up to $8.5bn for the last three months. Apple will report its earnings for the same period later this month. Leading smartphones are routinely chewing up more data than tablets, according to a report. Devices like the iPhone, Samsung Galaxy SIII and HTC Sensation XL all take up more of your Internet allowance that larger gadgets. The study blamed more advanced features like mobile chipsets and 4G/LTE support for the surge in demand. Consumers were also behind the rise as those with smartphones also seem to have ‘increasingly voracious appetites’ when it comes to data. The findings are surprising as tablets have more functionality than smartphones so would on the face of it seem to chew up more of your monthly plan. They also use Wi-Fi meaning that you are not eating into your allowance when you surf the web. Researchers found that smartphones tend to use significantly more data than a tablet . Analytics firm Arieso examined the data demands of more than one million users over a 24 hour period in November last year covering 125 different devices. Overall, six of the ten most data hungry devices were smartphones - including the top three. Using an iPhone 3 as the base level, or 100% of usage, the report found that the iPhone 5 had the most data volume at 414% by comparison. The latest Samsung Galaxy SIII came in at 315% and the HTC Sensation had 317%. The iPad 2 was just 259% by comparison. The report said: ‘It is remarkable that users of the flagship smartphone devices from Apple, HTC and Samsung are seen to consume more data than the tablet users. ‘This is the first time that this dominance has been seen so consistently across manufacturers and reflects two trends: the inexorable increases of data consumption in smartphone devices and the relatively consistent use of tablets in WiFi (rather than cellular) coverage areas’. Another surprising finding of the study was that the top one per cent of subscribers used up 40 per cent of data, although this was down on last year when it was half. The report says: ‘Recent smartphone launches continue to reveal new breeds of data subscribers with increasingly voracious appetites, in part fuelled by the blurring of smartphone and tablet functionality. ‘The demands of prior smartphone subscribers are formidable and well known in the industry, especially with regards to iPhone 3G data volumes and numbers of data calls. ‘However, the introduction of new data-intense features on recent smartphones (such as the A6 chipset, larger Retina display and LTE support on the iPhone 5) raises the expectation that the users of these new smartphones will be even more intense data consumers’.","Dramatic cuts to component orders blamed on 'weaker than expected' demand .

"An out-of-control satellite plummeting to Earth at 18,000mph could land almost anywhere this evening –  excluding North America, Nasa warned tonight. The craft, which is the size of a bus, will break up on entering Earth’s atmosphere, flinging huge chunks of metal weighing up to 350lb across hundreds of miles. NASA said it will only know two hours before impact where it will land – and even that prediction will only be accurate to the nearest 6,000 miles. It could be anywhere between the 57th parallel north, which crosses Britain at around Inverness, and the 57th parallel south, which passes just below South America.

"Mobile phones could be able to emit holograms after a US company created a projector small enough to fit into the device. A prototype the size of a Tic-Tac is bringing science fiction to life with an image that in tests has been smooth and consistent. The company behind it says that phones will have the same capabilities as R2-D2 in Star Wars when the robot emits a hologram of Princess Leia. Natalie Portman as Padme Amidala with R2D2: Soon you too could have his talents . The technology could also be used on TVs, computer screens, smart watches and even tablets. The chip has been developed by California-based Ostendo Technologies Inc which has spent nine years working on it. It will start selling a 2D version of its high-res projector next year, with the hologram-projecting one set to launch in 2016. The company’s chief executive Hussein El-Ghoroury said: ‘Imagine if everything coming back to you was in 3D; all of your shopping, all of your gaming, every way you retrieve data’. The Ostendo Quantum Photonic Imager is an image processor with thin micro light-emitting diodes and software which renders the image properly. It consists of six chips laid together that so far can emit a 3D image of green dice into the air. Ostendo is being financed by £60million from venture capital firms and Peter Thiel, Facebook’s first outside investor. Star Wars: C3PO and R2D2 (right). The company behind the new device says that phones will have the same capabilities as R2-D2 when the robot emits a hologram of Princess Leia . It has also been awarded around £25million by the US government’s futuristic Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Holograms have recently been used to resurrect dead pop stars such as Michael Jackson, who stunned the crowd when he ‘performed’ at the Billboard Awards earlier this year. Rapper Tupac Shakur has also been resurrected and a hologram of him has appeared at a number of concerts including the Coachella festival in 2012. Holographic devices have been around in some form or another since the 19th Century but only now has the technology been cheap enough for them to be considered for large scale production. Microsoft is working on its own virtual reality room and Facebook recently bought Oculus for £1.2billion. The technology firm has developed a headset that puts the user in a 3D environment akin to the 1992 science fiction drama The Lawnmower Man.","Technology could also be used on TVs, computer screens, smart watches and tablets .

"Rupert Murdoch was mocked on Twitter for 'hypocrisy' after he said two scandal-hit politicians running for office was 'unbelievable' Rupert Murdoch has been ridiculed on Twitter after Tweeting that he thought contrition is 'out of date'. The media mogul said that he could not believe that two disgraced New York politicians were running for public office once more. But Twitter users seized on his own troubles and his long history of being ruthless in his business dealings to mock him. Murdoch, 82, recently filed for divorce from his third wife Wendi Deng without apparently notifying her of his intentions. MPs have also asked him to return to Parliament to answer more questions over the phone hacking scandal after he was secretly recorded saying that payments to police happened all the time. Murdoch was talking about shamed New York politicians Eliot Spitzer and Anthony Weiner when he made his comments. Weiner is running for mayor of the city despite having to resign from his Congressional seat in 2011 due to a sexting scandal. Spitzer was governor of New York until 2008 when he was forced out after being caught using high class prostitutes. He is now running for comptroller of New York which would put him in charge of the city's finances and pensions. Murdoch wrote: 'Almost unbelievable. Both Spitzer and Weiner running for office. 'Contrition apparently out of date.' Eliot Spitzer, left, was governor of New York until 2008 when he was caught using prostitutes and Anthony Weiner, right, is running for mayor of New York after a sexting scandal in 2011 forced him out of Congress . The response was immediate with some Twitter users saying that 'could not stop laughing'. User Lucas Shaw Tweeted: 'Says the man going through a divorce' whilst Richard Pacher said: 'Where is yours sir?' Allan Brauer wrote: 'Remind us all of the time lapse between each of your divorces and remarriages, Rupert?' whilst Jen Chung said: 'Look who's talking!' Despite his reputation, Murdoch recently showed his more sensitive side after launching an investigation to find the Sun reporter who secretly recorded him during a meeting to address their concerns about the way staff had been treated over phone hacking. Twitter users ridiculed Murdoch's statement as he is divorcing wife Wendi Deng . The newspaper's editor David Dinsmore has supposedly revealed to colleagues that in a phone call from America Murdoch said that he felt 'hurt by what has happened'. It was during that meeting that Murdoch said that payments to police were part of 'the culture of Fleet Street'. Scotland Yard is now looking at the recording as part of Operation Elveden, its investigation into illegal payments to public officials.","Media mogul said it was 'unbelievable' the politicians were running .

"Osama bin Laden was planning a terrorist outrage to mark the 10th anniversary of 9/11 with Barack Obama number one on his hit list. The former leader of Al Qaeda wanted to shoot down the U.S. President’s jet Air Force One during a trip abroad. He also wanted to murder General David Petraeus, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, and was still obsessed with using planes to carry out terror attacks. Attack: Osama Bin Laden was planning to bring down Air Force One with President Barack Obama on board . Target: Bin Laden was hoping to take out the presidential jet while it transported Barack Obama on a foreign visit . Plot: Osama bin Laden had been planning to attack the U.S. on the 10th anniversary of 9/11. Every year since the initial attack two blue lights have shone in the place of the towers in memory of the victims . But was he in control? Other intelligence gleaned from the Pakistan lair suggested Bin Laden was losing his grip over Al Qaeda . The terror chief had . already begun putting a team of militants together for the attack, . according to communications seized by Navy Seals from his Pakistani . lair. Ideally one of his followers would fly a jet into a major sporting event in America, leading to massive loss of life. The disclosures came from the ‘treasure trove’ of intelligence seized at the mansion hideout in Pakistan where bin Laden was killed during a raid by U.S. special forces earlier this year. Officials say that the attack he was planning was in the preliminary stage and that bin Laden had been discussing who would carry it out with his operations chief Attiyah Abd al-Rahman. The plan was to shoot down Air Force one or Marine One, the President’s helicopter, whilst it was in mid-flight by firing a missile or rocket propelled grenade from another aircraft. General Petraeus would also be killed in a similar fashion, the documents show. Former FBI agent Brad Garrett said that despite improvements in security the plan to hijack a small jet and fly it into a sports stadium could work. ‘We have so many small airports, you could fly below radar,’ he said. ‘That's possibly doable.' Although at the embryonic stage, the details of the plot lead CIA acting director Michael Morell to tell staff that one of their top priorities was to ensure such an attack never took place. The haul of computers and handwritten journals recovered from the compound in Abottabad have taught CIA operatives more in the past weeks than they knew in the previous 10 years. But he had been . having disagreements with his operations chief Attiyah Abd al-Rahman, on . who should be included in the attack team, the Wall Street Journal . reported. Interestingly Bin Laden may have been losing his grip on control of the terror group. According to other materials in the treasure trove of documents found at his Abottabad lair during the May 2 raid, he was often ignored by his henchmen. 'What we found was that he was very isolated, and it is clearly the case . he was struggling to continue to hold on to the type of influence and . to direct operations in ways he may have been able to do in the past,' a . U.S. official said. Plans for an attack on the 9/11 . anniversary were only in the discussion phase, according to U.S. officials who added they hadn't seen any signs the plot was ready to be . carried out. The plot was one of a smattering of threats to come out of the materials seized during the raid in which Bin Laden was killed. In . those first days afterwards, intelligence officials confirmed there had . been strong evidence Bin Laden was all for carrying out attacks on . significant American dates - July 4 and September 11 for example. But this is the first time they have spoken of an actual attempt planned for this year's anniversary. Counter-terrorism staff from . half-a-dozen U.S. agencies have now raked over the entire bounty . collected from the raid, but have had little success extracting any . concrete leads from the documents. Intelligence: Documents seized in the raid indicated Bin Laden was keen to carry out future attacks on significant American dates, like July 4, left, and September 11, right . Information including phone numbers that could have led to other terrorist leaders were rendered useless almost as soon as they fell into the Government's hands, officials revealed. 'The treasure trove has not led to any big takedowns, because the bad . guys knew we had it and adapted,' a senior U.S. official told the Journal. The two phone numbers that Bin Laden had sewn into his clothing at the time of his death led nowhere, they added. Little yield: Other material gathered during the raid at the hideout in Abottabad has not led to many concrete leads . Situation room: Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, along with members of the national security team, and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton receive an update on the mission against bin Laden before he is killed by U.S Navy Seals . One connected to a public phone centre in the tribal areas of Pakistan; the other was a dead end. Other numbers scattered about the compound also led nowhere. Meanwhile relations between the U.S. and Pakistan continue to go down hill. The Pakistani government are livid about the raid, claiming not to have known anything about it before it was carried out. Historic: President Obama announces the death of bin Laden from the East Room of the White House on May 2. The Obama administration has said it has 'no regrets' about the raid despite relations with Pakistan at an all-time low . Celebration: Thousands took to the streets in New York City to celebrate the death of Bin Laden . Ill feeling: The May 2 raid has caused a lot of anti-American feeling in Pakistan and has left relations between the two nations frosty . The Obama administration, worried about leaks within the Pakistani government, didn't want  to tell Islamabad before the raid, it has been reported. Some U.S. officials believe certain fractions of the Pakistani government knew about Bin Laden's whereabouts. The CIA has met repeatedly with Pakistan's intelligence agency to try and smooth things over. The most recent meeting came today when Pakistan intelligence chief, Lt Gen Ahmad Shuja Pasha met with CIA acting Director Michael Morell to discus how the two nations could move forward in the fight against terrorism. The Obama administration announce last Sunday it was suspending $800million in aid to Pakistan, as a punishment for what it sees as not aiding the ongoing counter-terrorism threat.","Documents found at Bin Laden's lair reveal attack was in planning stages .

"When the Queen ordered a painstaking replica to be made of Queen Victoria's christening gown for her descendants, even she might not have expected to see it get so many airings. Today young Maud Elizabeth Daphne Marina Windsor, Prince and Princess Michael of Kent's first grandchild, became the latest royal baby to wear the Honiton lace robe, last sported by Prince George of Cambridge just two months ago. Like the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's son, Maud was baptised at the Chapel Royal, St James's Palace. Another royal baby in 2013: Lord and Lady Frederick Windsor with their daughter, Maud, in the State Apartments at St James's Palace following her private christening . Prince George of Cambridge was christened at St James's Palace in October in the same gown - a replica of the one passed down the royal generations from Queen Victoria . But as 42nd in line to the throne, the event was far more low-key, with no senior members of the royal family attending. She . was driven into the palace by her adoring parents, Lord Freddie Windsor . and his wife, Lady Sophie – also known as Peep Show actress Sophie . Winkleman. The four-month-old, also wearing an embroidered cream hat tied with ribbons, was carried to the service by her thespian mother. Baby's big day: Sophie Winkleman arrives at St James Palace with daughter Maud Windsor on her lap ready for her christening . Play time: The family keep the four-month-old amused with a Sophie The Giraffe toy . The . original royal christening robe, of fine Honiton lace lined with white . satin, was made in 1841 for Queen Victoria's eldest daughter, Victoria, . Princess Royal. The original gown was subsequently worn for all Royal baptisms, including The Queen, her children and her grandchildren. But . in 2008 it became clear that the gown was becoming increasingly . delicate and the Queen commissioned her dresser, Angela Kelly, to make a . hand-made replica in order to preserve the original. James, . Viscount Severn, son of the Earl and Countess of Wessex, was the first . member of Royal Family to wear this replica gown in April that year. Since then it is believed to have been used by the Queen’s grandson, Peter Phillips, for the baptisms of both his daughters. And . it is likely to be dusted off again next year as his sister, Zara . Phillips, is due to give birth to her first child in January. The latest wearer, baby Maud, was born in Los Angles, where the couple currently live, on August 15. Although she is 42nd in line to the throne, Maud has not been given a title, a decision that dates back almost a century. Prince and Princess Michael's children are known as Lord and Lady, and not Prince and Princess because when King George V created the House of Windsor in 1917 he ruled that only the sons of a brother of the king would be princes with the title of Royal Highness. It was also deemed that their children would have the style and title of the sons of non-royal English dukes. Proud grandfather: Prince Michael of Kent arrived with his wife and daughter Lady Gabriella Windsor, pictured . Glamorous grandmother: Princess Michael of Kent, left, looked younger than her 68 years . Lady Gabriella had a big smile for the cameras, left, while Sophie tried to ignore them . The actress's family were seen entertaining the child as they arrived at the venue with a toy that shares her mother's name - Sophie the Giraffe. Meanwhile, the baby's proud grandfather Prince Michael of Kent, the Queen's cousin, arrived with his wife and their daughter Lady Gabriella. The two Windsor woman beamed for the cameras as both had pulled out the stops to look glamorous for the occasion. Princess Michael of Kent looked much younger than her 68 years in a silver outfit and pill box hat. Her daughter, 32, looked equally stylish wearing an embellished cocktail hat, sparking diamond earrings and a blue dress coat. Ms Winkleman said she hopes to introduce her daughter to Prince George over Christmas lunch at Buckingham Palace. Maud, left and Prince George in the Honiton lace robe: It is hoped the royal babies will meet over Christmas . The prince was born a month earlier than Maud who arrived at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Centre in L.A. Ms Winkleman, who is based in the U.S. for her acting career, told Hello! magazine that the labour was 'long and hard'. The 33-year-old said: 'By the end I was begging for a caesarean thinking, I can't do this anymore - but I managed a natural birth with some wonderful doctors and midwives along with Freddie in the room with me, who were just stunningly brilliant, saying, ""You can do this!"". Their dynamic, American positivity carried me through.' She said of her financial . analyst husband being present at the birth: 'He was very brave, because . it wasn't delicate or pretty and I was horrid to him. He read me a crossword clue in the middle of it and I just wanted to throw a saucepan at his head.' Explaining their choice of name, Lord Freddie, 34, said: ‘We liked the idea of an old-fashioned English name and there are a couple of Princess Mauds in my father's family from a hundred years ago - one was the youngest daughter of Edward VII who ended up being Queen of Norway, and another was a granddaughter of Edward VII by his daughter Princess Louise. Support: Sophie said her husband Lord Freddie Windsor was 'very brave' during the labour as she 'just wanted to throw a saucepan at his head' 'It's also a beautiful, elegant name and it was always our first choice. Elizabeth is a tribute to the Queen, Daphne is Sophie's grandmother, who she was very close to and Marina is my paternal grandmother.' Speaking about his granddaughter, who is 42nd in line to the throne, Prince Michael said after her birth: 'We are absolutely thrilled by the arrival of our beautiful first granddaughter, Maud. We are both besotted with her. Not only does she have the prettiest blue eyes and adorable tiny feet, but she is also remarkably well-behaved.'","Maud Elizabeth Daphne Marina was born in L.A. in August .

"Prince William described her as 'an extremely talented British actress who I should probably call granny' following her film portrayal of Her Majesty. Now, it appears Dame Helen Mirren has had words with the real Queen about the moment the Duke of Cambridge presented her with an honorary fellowship award at the BAFTAs last night. The elegant actress, who could be seen wagging her finger at the head of state, was among around 250 stars to be introduced to members of the royal family personally at a glittering Buckingham Palace this evening. Speaking about being introduced to Her Majesty, she said: 'You're thinking ""its the Queen it's the Queen""' - and when asked if she still got starstruck, she replied: 'Of course, even more so I think because I feel self conscious, you know.'

It never fails to surprise me and again it's what everyone says when they meet her - it was what overwhelmed me the first time I met her.' Dame Helen then met the Duchess of Cambridge, whom she told: 'Your husband called me granny last night' - to which a giggling Kate replied: 'I know' and revealed he had asked her whether she thought the joke 'appropriate'. As Dame Helen and other members of film royalty met members of the . real royal family, Kate ensured she stood out at the star-studded Dramatic Arts Reception in a vibrant . red Alexander McQueen dress.

"The Duchess of Cambridge coxed a poorly young girl into a Christmas sing-a-long today - with the help of a toy frog. Kate, 31, found herself resorting to the puppet to charm some of the children at Shooting Star House Children's Hospice in Hampton, Middlesex. Even then, some were not so impressed. When one little girl, Demi-Leigh Armstrong, 5, from Ashford, Middlesex, complained that her friend was short of a musical instrument during a sing-song, Kate offered her a rattle. 'Do you want to give him this one?' she asked Demi-Leigh, who replied emphatically: 'No,' before turning her back on the Duchess. Scroll down for video .

Demi-Leigh, . helped give her a posy of roses and the Duchess wished her happy . Christmas. 'But it's not Christmas yet,' said Demi-Leigh. 'Bye then,' said Kate. 'Oh give me a hug first,' said the little girl, grabbing her leg, and the pair exchanged a thumbs up. Demi-Leigh, . who received her transplant a year and a half ago after her mother . Jayne Figgins, 33, donated a kidney will need a further . transplant at some point. 'You've just got to get on with it. You know . the kidney will fail because it will one day.

Kate, . who is royal patron of East Anglia's Children's Hospices, spent an hour . and 20 minutes touring the hospice, which has beds for 10 children and . daycare facilities for more at any one time. She seemed at ease as she met the families of the children being treated, as well as the staff and volunteers. She was smart but casually dressed for the occasion in navy blue skinny jeans and a grey . £275 Reiss jacket with £225 black wedge ankle boots from Russell and Bromley. Royal patron: Kate chatted to parents including Nicola Dasilva pictured with her son Frankie (21 months) during her tour . The hospice is run by Shooting Star Chase, a charity which cares for 650 children and young people with life-limiting conditions at its centres in Hampton and Guildford . Caring: Kate became royal patron of East Anglia Children's Hospices following her marriage to the Duke of Cambridge and regularly visits hospices to show her support . Kate spent most of her time asking parents about their children and their experience of Shooting Star Chase, which runs the hospice and one in Guildford, Surrey. But she did reveal that her baby son, Prince George, had just been introduced to 'messy play'. Mother Louise Wilks from Harefield, west London, said: 'She was so sweet, absolutely lovely and she really puts you at ease because obviously you are a little tense to meet someone so important. She was down to earth but had a real aura about her. 'She asked me about my boys and how we use Shooting Star Chase and I told her how they like messy play. She said she has just introduced George to messy play and what fun it was.' The Duchess also chatted at length to Nicola Dasilva, 25, from Merton, south London, whose 21-month-old son Frankie was so poorly he was given a week to live when he first arrived at the hospice last year. 'He's still here. He's a fighter,' said Nicola. Frankie, who is blind, fed from a tube, and dependent on oxygen due to a rare bone condition, infantile osteoporosis, is still not expected to live beyond the age of three but his mother told Kate she had found his two-month respite care at the hospice a great help. 'I've got a three-year-old girl as well,' she told Kate, who replied: 'Gosh, you've got your hands full.' During her tour, the Duchess also tried her hand at art, drawing a dog with floppy ears in a therapy session for children. Another parent Britt Armstrong-Gash, . from New Malden, Surrey, told Kate there was little support for families . outside the hospice. 'She was really lovely, very sincere, her . beauty shone from within,' she said. ,She asked about how we use the . facilities here and what life is like.  I told her how we get very . little support from outside and how important Shooting Star Chase is to . us. High Street style: Kate wore a grey £275 jacket from Reiss and £225 wedge ankle boots by Russell and Bromley . Mother Alison Buck, from East Moseley, revealed that some of the . children had been expecting another visitor. She said: 'We hadn't told . our children who was coming, we just said it was someone really special. They thought it was Mr Tumbles but they certainly weren't disappointed . when the Duchess walked in.' The Duchess also met volunteers who help out at the hospice. She . plans to launch a new initiative to encourage more people to volunteer . in hospices. A Kensington Palace spokesman said: 'The Royal . Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry is . currently developing a pilot for a volunteering programme to support . families of children with life-limiting conditions. A key component of . today's visit is for The Duchess to meet a group of Shooting Stars . volunteers, to better understand how they support the hospice and its . families.' Kate . became royal patron of East Anglia Children's Hospices following . her marriage to the Duke of Cambridge and has become involved in the . extended hospice network around the UK. In April 2013, she recorded a video message in support of Children's Hospice Week. In it, she said: 'Children's hospices . provide lifelines to families at a time of unimaginable pain. The . support they give is vital. In order to carry out this wonderful work, . our help is needed. 'With our support, those providing . children's palliative care can continue to offer these extraordinary . services. It does not bear thinking about what these families would do . without this.' Earlier this year when she was pregnant, she visited Naomi House in Hampshire to draw attention to the wide range of services offered by children's hospices. Today's visit came after Kate and Prince William attended a screening of the film Mandela: Long Walk To Freedom, as news broke of the leader's death. Turned into a sombre event: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were watching a screening of Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom as news broke of the leader's death . William paid tribute to the 95-year-old as they left the Odeon in Leicester Square last night. He said: 'I just wanted to say it's extremely sad and tragic news. 'We were just reminded what an extraordinary and inspiring man Nelson Mandela was. My thoughts and prayers are with him and his family. It's very sad.' Kate wore a bespoke ivory Roland Mouret gown but kept up her reputation as a fan of the High Street by teaming it with a £19.99 Zara necklace that has since sold out. The Duke of Cambridge has presented medals to members of the Irish Guards who have recently returned from operations in Afghanistan. William, who is Colonel of the regiment, presented operational service medals to soldiers of No. 2 Company, 1st Battalion at Mons Barracks in Aldershot, Hampshire.

"Prince George's christening went perfectly, by all accounts, with a smiling baby and a mother who could barely contain her joy. What a contrast to the christening of George’s father William 31 years ago. On that day, August 4, 1982, the ceremony took place in the ornate cream Music Room at Buckingham Palace, a far more formal choice than the Chapel Royal in St James’s Palace where George was christened yesterday. Relaxed affair: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge smiled throughout the ceremony, while the circumspect baby prince appeared to follow proceedings with interest . 'A trial'@ A radiant Diana later admitted she found William's christening exhausting . Princess Diana, just 21 and wearing a fuchsia pink, blue and white floral dress with a pink hat set at a rakish angle, looked radiant. But she later confided to friends that it had been a trial. ‘No one consulted me as to whether 11am would fit in with William’s schedule,’ she said. ‘I was totally excluded, totally exhausted and the photos went on and on. I blubbed my eyes out.’ She wasn’t alone. Her son – William Arthur Philip Louis, 44 days old – may have uttered only three small cries as the then Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie, poured water over his head, but he grumbled his way through the subsequent photo session. Formalities: Diana holds William in the official photo from his christeningm accompanied by the Queen, Prince Philip and the Queen Mother . Future king: The three month old Prince George, at Chapel Royal in St James's Palace, before the ceremony began . Prince Charles dabbed at his son’s tears with a handkerchief and Diana tried to soothe William by popping her finger in his mouth to suck. But every time she took it away, he cried some more. Most of the senior royals were in attendance for William’s baptism, whereas just five attended yesterday’s event: the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall and Prince Harry. Prince Andrew has missed out on both occasions. He wasn’t invited to George’s baptism, and couldn’t go to William’s because he was still in the South Atlantic after the Falklands conflict. Nor did the late Princess Margaret attend William’s baptism. She was in Italy, combining a holiday with official engagements. Mother's pride: There were some similarities between the two events . Matching outfits: Kate carries her son after the christening, accompanied by the Duchess of Cornwall  and Pippa Middleton . Prince George was incredibly well-behaved during the day's proceedings. Queen Elizabeth called the event a 'very nice' family occasion . Proud grandfather: The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall leave the Chapel Royal . The Queen Mother was there, of course – the date was chosen to coincide with her 82nd birthday – as was Earl Spencer, Diana’s brother (another notable exception yesterday). The Queen wore an outfit of periwinkle blue with white spots, and yesterday she was in blue again. In contrast to Diana’s vividly coloured frock, Kate went for neutral cream. Once the 25-minute ceremony to baptise William was over, the party moved into the White Drawing Room next to the Music Room for the photographs, which were taken by Kent Gavin, a Daily Mirror photographer of the ‘old school’. Finally there was a formal lunch. There was no such formal sit-down meal . yesterday. Instead, the proud parents hosted an informal tea party at . Clarence House. The whole event, declared the Queen, was a ‘very nice’ family occasion. Queen Victoria: In profile, the family characteristics are clear to see. Right, a chubby-cheeked William at his own christening in 1982 . Some things, however, don’t change. Those rounded cheeks, that thoughtful gaze... whether it be Prince . George, his father William, or his great, great, great, great, great . granny, Queen Victoria, the family resemblance is uncanny. There . are no photographs showing Victoria’s christening, but the undated . photograph below of the elderly widowed monarch still shows that Prince . George Alexander Louis has inherited many family characteristics.","Heir to the throne's perfect day was far cry from his father's .

"Pippa Middleton arrived for Prince George of Cambridge's christening yesterday in a couture coat that colour coordinated with Kate's outfit - as well as her nephew's christening gown. The Middleton sisters both chose to wear cream for the historic occasion, with Pippa opting for a 'trapeze' coat and 'Paris' dress by British designer, Suzannah Crabb. That Pippa, 30, matched her sister and nephew's gown was no coincidence. Suzannah revealed that the socialite had worked with her over the last few months to create the perfect outfit. Scroll down for video . Months in the planning: Pippa asked British designer Suzannah Crabb to help create her outfit for yesterday's historic occasion .

Proud grandparents: Pippa arrived with Carole and Michael Middleton . Magic Moment: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge with their young son, but the Middleton's business has been accused of cashing in on this relationship . The designer said she undertook 'hours of research into the history of royal christenings' to create something truly fitting of the occasion. She . said: 'We aimed for understated beauty, drawing inspiration from a . 1960s coat dress that I bought in LA, among other vintage looks and . archive pieces. 'The outfit had to be both . beautiful and appropriate from the length of the hem, to the style of the millinery and the subtle colour and cut. 'Lace has . been a popular fabric choice by significant guests at royal christenings since . 1926 and a dress in a style similar was worn by Princess Victoria of Sweden to . the christening of her daughter Princess Estelle in 2012.' The . designer worked with Pippa to create a bespoke version of the cream . coat, made from Italian wool with a blush pink trim and oyster silk . lining. But a similar version is on sale for £750. Suzannah also designed a cream version . of her lace 'Paris' dress for Pippa to wear yesterday. A similar navy style . costs £950 from her website. For an event the royals had been at pains to describe as ‘intimate’, low key and private, it was all rather, well … public. Within ten minutes of Pippa Middleton’s arrival at her nephew’s christening, the designers who made her outfit issued press releases about where the items could be purchased. British designer Suzannah spoke of the ‘hours of research’ that had gone into Miss Middleton’s outfit. Not far behind was a triumphant announcement from designer Catherine Walker that the Duchess’s mother, Carole, was sporting one of her coat dresses. Spokesmen for both companies declined to say yesterday whether the women received a discount – directly or indirectly – in return for generating publicity for their brands. A spokesman for Catherine Walker said: ‘This is not something that is ever commented on or discussed.’ The designer describes the dress as 'a modern shift, with a suitably high neckline and simple, clean lines, . finished in French lace.' Pippa teamed her outfit with a jaunty hat by British milliner Edwina Ibbotson, shoes by Emmy and carried a peach clutch bag - all put together with Suzannah's expert eye for style. Suzannah is a favourite designer of Pippa as she has worn her dresses on numerous occasions including society weddings. The designer said it was a 'dream come true' when Pippa approached her about her outfit for the christening. Pippa was saw the outfit take shape over several bespoke fittings and Suzannah said she was a joy to work with.

Special occasion: The Duchess of Cambridge carries her son Prince George after his christening . Popular choice: Kate, Pippa, George and Camilla, right, all wore cream but the Queen brought some colour to the proceedings in a blue coat and matching hat . She said: 'Creating a couture dress and frock coat not only for the occasion of the royal christening, but for Pippa Middleton, who is so naturally elegant and stylish is a commission that every designer dreams of. It's so exciting that British fashion has such a champion.' As well as Pippa, Suzannah has designed for Princesses . Beatrice and Eugenie and pop stars Paloma Faith and Marina and The . Diamonds. As Pippa arrived for the service yesterday, she stopped to chat and shake hands with the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev Justin Welby, who will baptised the three-month-old prince. She smiled broadly for the cameras as she arrived at St James's Palace with her parents, Carole and Michael Middleton, and brother, James. Pippa smiles for the cameras as she's driven from the service . The magazine columnist, whose brunette hair was swept off her face in a half-up style, was not joined by her stockbroker boyfriend Nico Jackson, 35. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were keen for yesterday's service to be an intimate, family affair  - despite the worldwide interest - and only 24 guests were invited. Pippa is not one of the prince's godparents but will take a prominent role in his upbringing as his only aunty. Along with Prince Harry, she was given a key role during the service as the Duke and Duchess asked their brother and sister to give readings at the christening. Pippa read the first lesson, from the Gospel of St Luke, Chapter 18, verses 15-17. Pippa gained notoriety as maid of honour at the royal wedding after causing a stir in her figure-hugging bridesmaid's dress that saw her dubbed 'her royal hotness'. 'It's startling to achieve recognition on account of your sister, brother-in-law and bottom,' she admitted in her party book Celebrate. James Middleton risked comparison with his nephew’s namesake, King George V, by showing off a bushy beard at the christening yesterday. But not everyone was convinced that the Duchess of Cambridge’s brother mastered the beard as well as the Queen’s grandfather. On Twitter, it was described as ‘vast’ and ‘prolific’, while one user wrote: ‘James Middleton. What is that beard?!’. Another user wrote: ‘You’d think James Middleton would have shaved his beard, not look like he’s just spent three months at sea.’ The 26-year-old was seen with a full beard last month while out with girlfriend Donna Air. Observers suggested Mr Middleton, who owns a cake-making business, could be trying a more mature look for television presenter Miss Air, who is eight years his senior.

"As he worked the room at a swanky cocktail party for the great and the good in Colorado over the weekend, Prince Harry was handed a glass of Pimm’s by a waiter. Eyeing his drink, a smiling Harry innocently told a fellow guest: ‘I didn’t realise you had Pimm’s in America.’ Quick as a flash, his principal private secretary, Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, moved in and spirited the glass away. It was a telling vignette. Having a ball: Prince Harry plays volleyball at the opening of the Warrior Games in Colorado Springs . Down and out: Harry was playing for the UK against an American team . Grinning and winning: Harry's easy laughter has wowed America . With those naked pictures of Harry in Las Vegas – taken during a drunken game of strip billiards – still fresh in the memory, courtiers are anxious that he jettisons his ‘party prince’ image on his current week-long official tour of America. Being photographed clutching a glass of alcohol does not sit well with this picture of the new, mature Harry. No wonder, perhaps, one stateside newspaper has cheekily christened the trip ‘The Rehab Tour’. In truth, however, Harry seems to be doing a perfectly good job of charming the pants off America without the help of his royal image-makers. Already, the 28-year-old prince has managed to turn First Lady Michelle Obama – who Harry privately describes as ‘a very cool lady’ – into something resembling a giggling teenager during a hugely successful visit to the White House. Meanwhile, amid scenes of pop star-like hysteria, the world’s most eligible bachelor was greeted by 500 screaming girls when he paid a visit to the Senate in Washington for an event to publicise the HALO Trust, the landmine charity supported by his late mother Princess Diana. The prince has also won many admirers across the pond for his quiet dignity during a sombre wreath-laying ceremony at the Arlington military cemetery. Home turf: Prince Harry said he would like to see the Warrior Games come to Britain . Sell-out: The young royal believes the Games would fill an 80,000 capacity stadium . He was similarly impressive as, in his combat fatigues, he displayed the genuine empathy and warmth that comes so naturally to him when meeting severely injured servicemen at a rehabilitation centre in Maryland. Later, he gamely got stuck in during a game of volleyball with wounded soldiers at the Warrior Games, a sports event for injured servicemen in Colorado Springs. Prince Harry found himself sitting on the floor during the match, before being chased Benny Hill-style round the court by US Olympic gold medal-winning beach volleyballer Misty May-Treanor. Army medic Stacey Byrne, 26, who was injured in Afghanistan in 2007, said: ‘It was a good first effort, but it would have been better if he had stayed on his bum for longer. Caring: Prince Harry displayed genuine empathy for the wounded soldiers he met . ‘It would be great if he could take it up as a sport.’ Harry called for the Warrior Games to be brought to Britain and said he couldn’t think of a better use for the Olympic Stadium in London. He said: ‘I only hope in the future, the near future, we can bring the Warrior Games to Britain and continue to enlarge this fantastic cause. ‘I don’t see how it wouldn’t be possible to fill a stadium with 80,000 people, not to watch Olympics, not to watch Paralympics, but to watch wounded servicemen fight it out amongst each other – not on a battlefield but in a stadium.’ Tomorrow, Harry is due to ride into New York on an iconic Routemaster London bus to plug a British government drive to promote Britain as a place to live, work and, above all, invest in. And a planned polo match featuring Harry this Wednesday in wealthy Greenwich, Connecticut – hosted by billionaire Peter Brant and his supermodel wife Stephanie Seymour in aid of the prince’s African charity – has become the hottest ticket for years. All in all, Harrymania has well and truly hit the States. And suddenly his rather childish high-jinks at his £5,000-a-night suite in Sin City last summer seem a long time ago. Could it be that Harry, who had teenage brushes with cannabis, brawls with photographers outside nightclubs and once donned a Nazi outfit for a fancy dress party, is finally growing up? If so, the transformation could hardly come at a more welcome time with the Queen’s recent announcement that she is scaling back on commitments that involve long-haul travel. Privately, Apache helicopter pilot Harry says he expects increasingly to fill his grandmother’s shoes on official trips to foreign shores, though he is adamant he will keep ‘one foot in the Army Air Corps and one foot in the Royal world’. Sir Peter Westmacott, the British ambassador to the US, speaks glowingly about Harry’s maturity and the way he has stepped up to the job this week. And the simple truth is that others in the Royal Family, including his brother William, can only look on with admiration and, occasionally, envy at the apparently effortless way Harry wows everyone from maimed soldiers to titans of big business. Serious competition: Prince Harry was dressed in a UK uniform as he took on the American team . Stiff competition: Prince Harry was playing against U.S. gold medallist Misty Mae-Treanor . The only lingering question is whether Harry’s self-destructive impulses will trip him up again. Certainly, the five-strong team travelling with him on this long-planned trip are rubbing their hands together in glee at its unalloyed success thus far, but there is still the unspoken fear that Harry is never far away from another mishap. Significantly, although Harry publicly professed he let his family down over the naked pictures furore last August, he remains privately unrepentant, complaining that he sees no tension between his growing official role and his insistence on letting his hair down once he is off-duty. And even as he approaches his 30th birthday next year, Harry remains prone to occasional outbursts of petulance that do not sit well with the more mature image his advisers are seeking to foster. A rather ill-tempered television interview after he arrived back from a 20-week tour of duty in Afghanistan in January, in which he moaned that he never wanted to give up being a foot soldier on patrol to fly helicopters, and complained he was ‘gawped’ at by fellow soldiers during mealtimes at Camp Bastion, made him sound spoilt. He also ill-advisedly let slip that he had killed Taliban fighters in his role as a helicopter gunner, raising fears among his advisers that this could make him a terrorist target. Room for improvement: Army medic Stacey Byrne said the royal needs to stay 'on his bum for longer' Wowing the crowds: Prince Harry has gained praise for his ease at talking to injured military and business leaders . Publicity: Prince Harry is promoting his charities during his tour . But increasingly, he is keen to display a more thoughtful image. Harry even proved himself to be a chip off the old block by upbraiding the female chief executive of a renewable energy company at a drinks reception hosted by the British consul in Colorado last week over the ‘visual impact’ of wind farms – a subject long close to the heart of his father Prince Charles, who once branded them ‘a horrendous blot on the landscape’. This trip has been facilitated by Harry’s aide Lowther-Pinkerton, who has spent months planning the tour with the help of Sir David Manning, the former British ambassador to the US, who acts as the Prince’s unpaid adviser on foreign matters after the Queen asked him to throw a protective arm around her errant grandson. But the trip was very much Harry’s idea. It is something of a swansong for Lowther-Pinkerton, a quietly intense man with an occasionally Goonish sense of humour, who is quitting the post to return to work in the private sector and to spend more time with his four young children at home in Suffolk. The highly decorated former SAS soldier will be a sad loss to Harry who views Lowther-Pinkerton as sort of father-confessor. Joining Harry in America this week is Lowther-Pinkerton’s replacement as his Private Secretary, Edward Lane Fox, a former officer in the Blues and Royals who is a distant relative of Baroness Martha Lane Fox, the internet businesswoman; and Harry’s new press secretary, Ed Perkins, who hitherto had the unenviable job as PR man to the gaffe-prone Prince Andrew. Quite patently Harry is a much easier sell than his uncle. Indeed, his polished performance in the States has helped dispel fears, once expressed by senior members of the royal household, that he was going down the ‘Prince Andrew route’ and risked being seen as a rather pointless ‘spare’ to his brother’s ‘heir’. Certainly, this is just the sort of trip, which is partly about boosting British business and investment, that would have gone completely ignored if it had been Andrew rather than Harry pressing the flesh. High five: Prince Harry met Lcpl Maurillia Simpson and British soldiers competing in the Warrior Games . Having a laugh: Prince Harry was relaxed among fellow armed forces veterans . And for all his impetuousness, Harry, who is dating dance student Cressida Bonas, is undoubtedly a breath of fresh air when set against the usual starched formality of the royals on tour. By way of illustrating the point, he is travelling without a valet or equerry and is getting his own clothes ready for his busy list of official functions in America (something his father or, for that matter, Andrew, would find unthinkable). And he flew across the Atlantic on a commercial flight, albeit in the Upper Class section of a Virgin jet. Even so, alongside the genuinely warm welcome he has received across the pond, there are cynical voices in the US media who think the new, responsible Harry is rather too good to be true. The New York Post sniffily asked its readers: ‘Can Dirty Harry really clean up his image?’ He has also unfairly come in for flak for supposedly using his planned visit to victims of Hurricane Sandy in New Jersey tomorrow as a PR ploy. ‘Prince Harry has quite an agenda to clean up his act,’ says Manhattan rebranding expert Leslie Singer. ‘But the US is the global thermometer of what’s in and what’s out. If the Americans love him and can forgive him, then hopefully everyone else will too.’ The only question now for the new responsible Harry is whether he can ride this wave of popularity without shooting himself in the foot again.","Prince Harry competed for Britain in Warrior Games sitting volleyball match .

"The sun may not have made it out in time for the annual Buckingham Palace garden party, but that didn't stop the Duchess of Cambridge debuting a beautiful summery look. Wearing a round-neck Emilia Wickstead coat in canary yellow silk, Kate brought a ray of sunshine to the proceedings today. She accessorised the coat, which neatly skimmed her by now very evident bump, with a cream Jane Corbett hat with rippled bow and large pearl drop earrings (and, it goes without saying, her trusty nude pumps). The party, when the Queen hosts a tea for 8,000 esteemed members of the public in the gardens of her London residence, is considered to be one of the highlights of the royal summer calendar. Scroll down for video . Sunny delight! Kate brightens up the Buckingham Palace Garden Party in a canary yellow coat . Royal bump watch: The duchess's tall, athletic physique has meant she has remained slender throughout - only now is her bump really beginning to show . In-laws: Kate spent much of the afternoon in the company of Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall . Kate spent much of the afternoon in the company of Prince Charles and Camilla, both of whom seemed to be predicting rain - they each clutched their trusty Fulton umbrella - but thankfully hadn't had to put them into use. Camilla wore a beautiful brocade coat by Fiona Clare topped off with a flamboyantly feathered hat, while Prince Charles looked elegant in dove grey tails. The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester and the Duke of Kent were also in attendance. This was the second year that Kate had attended the Queen's garden party, which the monarch uses as a way of thanking people who have contributed to public life or their local community. Kate attended the party for the first time last year, something which at the time was said to be a real rite of passage for the fledgling royal. This was also the second year that Kate attended alone. Last year William was tied up with duties on Anglesey, where he serves as a helicopter rescue pilot, and this time round too prior engagements kept him away. Spectacular: Buckingham Palace provides a beautiful backdrop for the uplifting event . Making her way through the . 8,000-strong crowd on the lawn to the rear of the palace, Kate, 31, . chatted with well-wishers including Marie Curie nurse Susan Bradley who . said afterwards; 'She instantly recognised my uniform and the daffodil . in my lapel and told me that she had great admiration for the work the . charity does as our staff cared for her own grandfather in his home when . he was terminally ill.' Another guest called out to Kate 'you . look lovely in yellow' to which she smiled and thanked him, gently . smoothing her hand over her swelling belly. She also chatted with guest Juliet Rogers about the affect the weather was having on her pregnancy, . 'She said that the one benefit of the . weather was that it was keeping her temperature down. She said she was . thankfully rather cool.'

It was only the second garden party . the Duchess had attended but is clearly learning fast, as she chatted . easily with several dozen guests as she slowly made her way to the green . and white stripped royal tea tent where the other members of the family . were slowly gathering. Among the guests was British Olympic . swimmer Rebecca Adlington, looking summery in a floral dress by, . appropriately, The Pretty Dress Company and Topshop shoes. She said: 'Everyone told me to wear . my Olympic uniform but how often do we get the chance to dress up for . something like this? I have been here a lot over the last year - we have . been milking the Olympics a lot, I know - but it is always a real . honour.' Julie Roberts, one of the founding . members of the Military Wives Choir was among those who chatted to the . Queen, resplendent in a sugar pink Karl Ludwig coat and dress and Angela . Kelly hat. Mrs Roberts was accompanied by her husband, Captain Tommy Roberts of the . Royal Marines, and sons Captain Thomas Roberts, also a marine, and . student son Ciaran. She said: 'We have sang for the Queen a number of times and it was a delight to meet her in person.'

Hostess with the most: At 87, the Queen at 87 still knows how to throw a great party - one of three garden events she will host this summer . The Queen, wearing a Karl Ludwig coat and Angela Kelly hat, met a member of the Military Wives Choir along with her military husband and two sons. On her lapel the Queen wore the star-shaped Jardine Star brooch, an eight-point diamond piece that was left to her by Lady Jardine in 1981. The Queen has since worn the piece many times . Kate chose a bespoke version of the Marella coat by high society design darling Emilia Wickstead. Kate has worn a number of garments by the much-admired designer, including a dusky pink dress worn at a garden party this time last year. This yellow silk coat is said on the website where an off-the-peg version can be found to be 'elegant and classic with a hint of playfulness' and is inspired by 1950s 'society swan' Marella Agneli.

Corbett has long been a trusted milliner to the Middletons and made the tilt-brim hat that Carole Middleton wore to the Royal Wedding in 2011. Corbett, who  has a studio in Hungerford, Berkshire, was trained under Rose Cory, milliner to the Queen Mother. Corbett also created headgear for Carole for Royal Ascot, the Derby, Trooping the Colour, for Pippa for various society weddings and for Kate, who wore a royal blue Jane Corbett at the Duke of Edinburgh's 90th birthday celebrations - and of course, Kate wore today's cream creation for the Order of the Garter. 2013: Kate today at the Buckingham Palace garden party. 2011: Kate at the Order of the Garter in Alexander McQueen coatdress . The Queen’s garden parties are quintessentially British and a chance to celebrate the achievements of people who have contributed to public life or their local community.They have been held at Buckingham Palace since the 1860s when Queen Victoria instituted what were known as public 'breakfasts', although they took place in the afternoon.In the 1950s the number of garden parties held at Buckingham Palace was increased from two to three a year, taking the place of presentation parties attended by debutantes.They have since evolved into a way of rewarding public service and are attended by people from all walks of life, invited on the recommendation of a variety of national organisations including the Government, Civil Service, Armed Forces and the Diplomatic Corps as well as charities and local Lord Lieutenants.The parties normally take place in June and July but have been brought forward this year due to the Jubilee celebrations. Esteemed guests: Attendees of the party are thanked by the Queen for their contribution to society . The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, accompanied by other members of the Royal Family, enter the palace gardens at 4pm to the sounds of the National Anthem played by as military band.Each member of the Royal family then circulates among the guests through 'lanes' which are peculiar to Royal garden parties. Random presentations are made so that everyone has an equal chance of speaking to Her Majesty and members of her family before they arrive at the Royal tea tent to meet VIP guests.Tea and other refreshments are served in enormous quantities. At a typical garden party, around 27,000 cups of tea, 20,000 sandwiches and 20,000 slices of cake are consumed with 400 waiting staff involved in the serving.Last year guests were treated to tea, iced coffee and organic apple juice along with cucumber and egg mayonnaise sandwiches, mini strawberry scones, coffee éclairs and tiny chocolate mousse cakes embossed with a gold crown.In recent years, the Queen has been forced to try and make savings elsewhere in her budget to meet the bill for greedy guests who devour an average of 14 tea-time treats each.At 6pm the Queen and the Royal party leave the garden and are escorted into the palace by the Yeoman of the Guard, Gentlemen at Arms and Gentlemen Ushers.","Kate attending Queen's annual tea party for second year running .

"He had just been dematerialised in the Tardis – and so, by the look of it, had his suit. For as Prince Charles toured the Doctor Who set yesterday, his jacket showed the clear signs of a running repair just below the left pocket. His spokesman was keen to scotch rumours that the Anderson and Sheppard suit had been caught in the crossfire from a Dalek, insisting the patch was a ‘temporary repair’ that would be ‘repaired less visibly in due course’. Scroll down for video . Fibre attack: The patch (bottom right) was clearly visible on the jacket of the Prince's suit . Royal tour: Matt Smith and co-star Jenna-Louise Coleman gave the future king and his wife Camilla a tour of the Doctor Who set in Cardiff where they met the famous Daleks . The Prince, known for having his . expensive clothes patched and darned rather than throw them away, has . been a Doctor Who fan since his teens. And Doctor Who has a new adversary of royal proportions after the Prince of Wales lent his voice to one of the Daleks. Charles tried his hand at being a sci-fi baddie during a visit to the BBC’s studios in Cardiff today. Using . a microphone plugged into a voice modulator, he uttered the Daleks’ famous 'exterminate' catchphrase - leaving the show’s writer Stephen . Moffat thoroughly impressed. He said: 'I haven’t thought about how I could weave a meeting between the Doctor and the royal family. But Prince Charles’s attempt at being a Dalek was great. 'There would be a part in the show for him if he wanted it.' According to actor Matt Smith, who is due to stand down as the current Doctor, the Prince has been a secret fan of the show since he was 15.

Impressed: Prince Charles was given the thumbs up by actor and sound technician Nicholas Briggs, who voices the Daleks . 'The other thing which stood out for me is he had fantastic shoes. Smith joked: 'He’s got the makings of a future Doctor!' Also giving the Prince the thumbs up was actor and sound technician Nicholas Briggs, who voices the Daleks. The Lyndhurst-born performer, who began practising Dalek voices at the age of five, said: 'The Prince has got a history of performing and has done stuff with The Goon Show previously, so he really stepped up to the plate. 'Apart from a couple of giggles at the end, he did really good.' The . royal couple were also shown around the props department, chatting with . set decorator Adrian Anscombe, who handed the Prince a sonic . screwdriver. 'He got it to work first time, which doesn’t usually happen,' he said. 'As it’s a custom-built prop it can take a bit of getting used to but the Prince has the knack.' Making friends: The Duchess of Cornwall and the Prince of Wales with a Cyberman and member of The Silence and an Ood as they visited Roath Lock Studios . Charles also came face-to-face with some of the show's other famous monsters - such as a Cyberman and a weeping angel. Following . the visit - which had BBC staff and journalists chuckling throughout - . the Prince then toured the new headquarters of his charity Prince's . Trust Cymru and met with volunteers and youngsters. A Clarence House spokeswoman said Charles was very passionate about the organisation. 'The . new Prince's Trust Cymru headquarters will support 3,500 vulnerable . young people across Wales this year, giving them the skills and . confidence to turn their lives around and move into jobs. 'It's . significant because in Cardiff alone, more than one in four young people . (30 per cent) are struggling to find a job (Office for National Statistics). 'The . Prince's Trust Enterprise programme is celebrating its 30th birthday . this year. 'It has helped 80,000 young people become their own boss since . 1983.

During the official opening, Charles addressed young people, staff, volunteers and supporters of The Prince's Trust. He said: 'I hope some of you here . today are beginning to benefit in a small way and I am also incredibly . proud of the difference the Trust can make to so many lives.' One of the young people who met the Prince was 27-year-old Sarah Hillier, from Pontypool. She is about to launch a custom-made teddy bear business with support from the Trust. She presented Charles with a bear created for his soon-to-be-born grandchild. Mrs Hillier decided she wanted to run her own business after running a successful cafeteria at her partner's workplace. She had to leave when her husband was made redundant and she found herself unemployed. But her entrepreneurial spirit meant . she was determined to find an idea that would work, and then her . nine-year-old daughter gave her just that - custom made teddy bears. Describing the bear she created for . the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's baby, she said: 'The bear is one of . my favourite designs and I have chosen a soldier's outfit for it. I just . hope this little bear is fit for a prince - or a princess!' The charitable theme also continued . for Camilla - who earlier in the week threw a tea party for seriously . ill children - as she visited the Emmaus Charity shop in Porthcawl, . Bridgend. It supports homeless people by giving them accommodation and work experience in a bid to turn their lives around.

A Royal spokeswoman added: 'The . tradition of physic gardens stretches back a number of centuries.

Taking control: The qualified helicopter pilot got to grips with its controls, while the Duchess of Cornwall pulled a lever to activate it . And completing an action packed day, the Prince headed to Ebbw Vale - where the Queen was met with a rapturous welcome during her Jubilee tour last year. He paid a visit to the offices of education charity Teach First, of whom he is a patron. Teach First, which launches in Wales in in September, aims to increase the number of teachers from less well off backgrounds. It has been given a three year contract by the Welsh Government and officials hope it will see 150 trainee teachers recruited on to the programme.

Town council member Nigel Burgess said locals now viewed the Prince as of one of their own. 'It's not only put us and local good causes on the map, but it's given us a tremendous sense of pride,' he added. 'It means all the more because this is supposed to be the Prince's holiday - but he's never put his feet up and locked himself in his holiday home.

But the real star of the show was the Duchess of Cornwall who cut a glamorous yet unassuming figure by the side of her husband, the Prince of Wales. While she dazzled last night in a flowing floor-length evening gown, she today opted for a more simple, yet nonetheless stylish look as she attended the inauguration ceremony for King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands. Style credentials: Camilla looked stunning in a powder blue gown at the inauguration of King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands at Nieuwe Kerk . Glamorous: Camilla showed off her glamorous side today in a chic pale blue dress with dazzling peal accessories . The 66-year-old donned a chic pale powder blue dress by one of her go-to designers Bruce Oldfield, which she teamed with an array of dazzling accessories. Her blonde hair was layered and voluminous and she wore an intricate feathered headpiece by Philip Treacy to match her dress. Grand arrival: Prince Charles of Wales and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall arrive to attend the inauguration ceremony for King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands at Nieuwe Kerk . Making an entrance: Camilla cut a stylish figure as she accompanied Charles to the inauguration this afternoon . Taking their seats: Prince Charles and his wife Camila took their seats at the Nieuwe Kerk or New Church in Amsterdam for the inauguration of King Willem-Alexander . The standout piece of her outfit was most certainly her pearl necklace - a Parker Bowles family heirloom- which she teamed with matching pearl earrings, a look she has made her signature style. While it is not unusual to see royal males wearing a cabinet-full of medals, Camilla was also sporting a vast array of regalia. On her left shoulder was her Family Order, a portrait of the Queen as a young woman set in diamonds and suspended from a ribbon. George IV started the formal practice of presenting Family Orders and the practice has been continued by his successors. Each sovereign commissions a unique portrait of themselves which is suspended on a different coloured ribbon - George V used white, George VI favoured rose pink while the Queen's is chartreuse yellow. The Orders are now worn on formal occasions by female members of the Royal Family only, although more than one Order can be worn at the same time. For example, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother wore the Orders of both The Queen and George VI. Camilla’s royal blue sash with a cross suspended from it and the bejewelled star pinned on her waist are all part of the insignia of a Grand Dame Cross of the Royal Victorian Order . Celebration: Dutch King Willem-Alexander and his glamorous wife Queen Maxima, centre, sing hymns at the Nieuwe Kerk or New Church in Amsterdam . Lady in blue: Queen Maxima looked stunning during the investiture ceremony with her husband . The Queen awarded her daughter-in-law . her highest personal honour last year to mark her seventh wedding . anniversary to Prince Charles. The Order was founded in April 1896 . by Queen Victoria and honours are in the Queen's personal gift, . independent of Downing Street. They are given by the head of state to . people who have served her or the monarchy in a personal way. As a Grand Dame Cross Camilla boasts . the letters GCVO after her name (as do several other senior female . royals including Princess Anne, the Countess of Wessex and the Duchess . of Gloucester). Announcing the news last year palace . sources told the Mail that the award recognised the Duchess's hard work . as a member of the monarchy. A glamorous affair: Denmark's Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary arrived . At a time when most women her age . would be looking forward to a slower pace of life, she now carries out . hundreds of royal engagements each year. Camilla has also taken on a wide range of patronages and travelled extensively overseas with the prince on official visits. Of course Charles was no slack in the . style stakes today either, wearing the Admiral of the Fleet Full . Ceremonial Uniform with sword, medals and the Cross of the Order of the . Crown (the Cross of the Order of the Crown is awarded by the Dutch . Sovereign for service to the Dutch Royal Household). Queen Maxima also upped the glamour . stakes in an eye-catching electric blue gown and matching floor-length . draped coat as she stood by her husband, King Willem-Alexander during . their investiture ceremony at Nieuwe Kerk or New Church in Amsterdam. Camilla really shone in the style stakes . last night when she and Charles joined Queen Beatrix Of The Netherlands . as she hosted a Gala Dinner ahead of her abdication. Camilla, 66, looked young beyond her years in a sweeping floor-length gown and dazzling tiara. Donning . a stylish Bruce Oldfield dress and diamond headpiece, Camilla stood by . her husband's side at the dinner with members of the Dutch royal family at Amsterdam's Rijksmuseu. Signature headwear: The Duchess of Cornwall wore a similar headpiece to the wedding of her son as well as to her own wedding to Prince Charles . Dazzling: Camilla, the dazzling duchess wowed onlookers as she turned out to celebrate the crowning of King Willem-Alexander of Holland as Queen Bea steps down . She looks the part: Donning a stylish Bruce Oldfield dress and diamond headpiece, Camilla stood by her husband's side at the dinner with members of the Dutch royal family at Amsterdam's Rijksmuseu . Her hair was voluminous in layers and the Boucheron honeycomb tiara she wore was loaned to her by the Queen. Often worn by the Queen Mother, the dazzling item comprised diamonds set in platinum and gave her outfit a dazzling edge. Camilla has been an unlikely source of . fashion and beauty advice for the Duchess of Cambridge. After advising Kate on who to see for . facials, Camilla, suggested that she had her hair coloured by . her top stylist Jo Hansford. When Kate was considering wearing . flowers in her hair on her wedding day, Camilla intervened and suggested . a tiara was more appropriate. Shine bright: Her hair was voluminous in layers and the Boucheron honeycomb tiara she wore was loaned to her by the Queen . And judging by Camilla's style credentials both today and last night, it really seems that she is taking her own advice. Camilla and Charles joined Prince Felipe and Princess Letizia of Spain and Denmark's Crown Prince Frederik and his wife. This morning, an emotional Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands signed over her throne to her eldest son Willem-Alexander as thousands poured on to the streets of Amsterdam to welcome their first king in more than 100 years. The 46-year-old gripped his mother's hand after they both put their signatures on the abdication document  at the Royal Palace in Amsterdam. Dashing couple: Prince Charles of Wales and Camilla looked dashing as they attended a dinner at the National Museum last night . The much-loved Beatrix ended her . 33-year-reign as thousands of orange-clad people cheered outside and . millions more watched on national television . The 75-year-old looked close to tears as she then appeared on a balcony overlooking some 20,000 of her subjects. 'I am happy and grateful to introduce to you your new king, Willem-Alexander,' she told the cheering crowd. Moments . later, in a striking symbol of the generational shift, she left the . balcony and the new king, his wife and three daughters - the children in . matching yellow dresses and headbands - waved to the crowd. Royal banquet: Queen Beatrix of The Netherlands  was flanked by Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte as she hosted a dinner at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam . 'Dear . mother, today you relinquished the throne. 33 years moving and . inspiring years. We are intensely, intensely grateful to you,' the new . king said. With her abdication, she becomes Princess Beatrix and her son ascends the throne as King Willem-Alexander. The . father of three's wife becomes Queen Maxima and . their eldest daughter, Catharina-Amalia, becomes Princess Orange and . first in line to the throne. Willem-Alexander, a 46-year-old water . management specialist, is expected to bring a less formal touch to the . monarchy together with his wife, a former investment banker from . Argentina. He has pledged to be a 21st century king, close to his . nearly 17 million subjects, and not a 'protocol fetishist'. Wearing . a sober purple dress, Beatrix signed the abdication document in front . of the Dutch cabinet, Willem-Alexander and Maxima, who wore a pale . rose-coloured dress with a shimmery skirt and enormous bow on her left . shoulder. 'Today, I make way for a new generation,' said Beatrix. A moment in history: The much-loved Beatrix ended her 33-year-reign as thousands of orange-clad people cheered outside and millions more watched on national television . Waving to the crowds: Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands with King Willem Alexander (L) and Queen Maxima (R) appear on the balcony of the Royal Palace to greet the public after her abdication . On what is a national holiday in Amsterdam - known as Queen's Day (likely to now become known as King's Day) Queen Beatrix handed over reign of Holland to her son, Prince Willem-Alexander Of Orange. He is said to be a jolly man with a great sense of humour. He has proved himself militarily - only stepping down yesterday from his role in order to take over from his mother. Shown great interest in affairs of the state. Very happily married to Queen Maxima since 2002. The pair met in 1999 in Sevilla, Spain, during the Seville Spring Fair. In an interview, they explained that he introduced himself only as Alexander because he didn't want her to know he was a Prince, she later found out the truth and thought he was joking. The couple have three daughters: Princess Catharina-Amalia, 10, Princess Alexia, 8, and Princess Ariane, 6.","Duchess of Cornwall joined Princes of Wales at inauguration ceremony for King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands .

"A woman photographer has been placed under formal criminal investigation in connection with pictures taken of the Duchess of Cambridge as she sunbathed in France, it emerged tonight. Legal sources in Paris said she is Valerie Suau, who admits taking images of Kate in the south of the country in September. She describes her pictures, published in France's La Provence regional newspaper, as 'all decent'. But she is now facing a criminal trial . along with a man believed to be Ernesto Mauri, the publisher of French . Closer magazine, which first ran the pictures. Both are being prosecuted . under strict privacy legislation. Probe: Legal sources in Paris said the photographer facing an investigation was believed to be Valerie Suau (left), who took images of Kate (right, pictured tonight in London) in the south of France in September . Kate, 31, and 30-year-old Prince . William took legal action against Closer in September, as their lawyer, . Aurelien Hamelle, described the Duchess as a 'a young woman, not an . object’. He said the royal couple had suffered a . 'grotesque breach of privacy' and felt 'violated' during a 'highly . intimate moment during a scene of married life'. Ms Suau, whose name is pronounced . 'sewer', has kept a low profile ever since the case, but police are . believed to have arrested her earlier this month. She took the photos on September 5 as the couple relaxed at Viscount Linley's retreat, Chateau d'Autet, in Provence. Referring to Princess Diana's death in . 1997, Mr Hamelle said it was 'just six days after the 15th anniversary . of the cynical and morbid hunt which led to the death of William's . mother'. Mr Hamelle told the court William and . Kate could not have known they were being spied on and a photographer . would have needed a long lens, even if he or she was on a public road. Controversial images: The French magazine Closer showed topless pictures of Kate in an issue last September . Mr Hamelle said that if the original . digital images were not handed in, the Mondadori group - which publishes . Closer - should be fined £8,000 a day for non-compliance. The Duke and Duchess also launched . criminal proceedings against the then unnamed photographer under . France's strict privacy laws. The French media are protected from . having to name their sources - including photographers - but the royal . couple are said to have made it a personal crusade to discover who took . the images. Ms Suau has denied being responsible . for taking any indecent images. She says she took pictures of Kate in . her swimsuit but not topless. Yet, despite her claims, no other photographer has been identified, nor even been placed in the area at the time. Delphine Pando, representing the . magazine, told a court case in the Paris suburb of Nanterre last year . that topless photographs were no longer considered shocking. She denied that the chateau was . inaccessible to public view and claimed the magazine did not hold the . rights to the pictures, so it could not be proved that it intended to . republish them. Photography spot: Some pictures were shot from a public road on a hill less than half-a-mile from the former hunting lodge, close to the medieval village of Viens, although it is possible to get closer on foot . Ms Suau, who lives close to Chateau . d'Autet, deep in the Provence countryside east of Avignon, told friends . there was no sign of British or French police anywhere, so allowing 'any . photographer who wanted' to take images. Some were shot from a public road on a . hill less than half-a-mile from the former hunting lodge, close to the . medieval village of Viens, although it is possible to get closer on . foot. The road, and nearby path, offers . clear views of the Chateau's raised swimming pool and its sun loungers, . where Kate and William spent most of their four day break. It was from here that a set of . intimate images were captured and later published in the French Closer . magazine, which is now being sued by the couple for invasion of privacy. Ms Suau produced one set of pictures . on Friday September 7th - the day the couple left. This is the same day . that the Closer pictures were taken. She aimed her camera at the pool at . around 1.30pm, where she saw William wearing just a pair of swimming . shorts and sunglasses as he read his I-pad. Kate, meanwhile, was in a . bikini. A Paris prosecutors source confirmed . that 'a female photographer' working for La Provence, and 'the publisher . of Closer' had both been placed under formal criminal investigation . over the topless pictures. St James's Palace said tonight the case was a matter for the French authorities.

"In the line of fire: Princess Diana campaigned vigorously for overseas development - but not necessarily on immigration . The Princess Diana Memorial Fund, to which millions of her admirers donated money, has been hijacked by Left-wingers to fund a pro-immigration propaganda campaign. Directors of the charity set up a secretive project called Changing Minds and then channelled hundreds of thousands of pounds into a string of associated organisations. The aim of the scheme is to alter British attitudes to immigration – which are currently in favour of far stricter border controls. Among some of its most successful achievements, it lists the establishment of a new ‘independent’ think-tank – criticised by a Labour MP as a front for Left-wing views on immigration. The Migration Observatory is advised by a senior journalist on the Left-wing Guardian newspaper, and the husband of its star columnist, Polly Toynbee. Last night Rosa Monckton, a close friend of Diana, described the decision as ‘outrageous’. She said: ‘I don’t ever recall Diana expressing any interest in this issue to me, and we spoke a great deal about her passions and concerns, particularly at the time that she was cutting down her charitable commitments. ‘She never wanted to be a figurehead or to be used overtly for lobbying purposes. To the extent that she remained involved in charitable work, it was of a purely practical nature, such as the removal of land mines, and the care of people with AIDS. ‘She was also always extremely careful never to get involved in anything that was remotely divisive along party political lines.’ The Diana Fund was established within days of Diana’s death in 1997, in response to the unprecedented outpouring of public grief. Its coffers were filled with £38million from the sale of the Elton John record Candle in the Wind (Goodbye England’s Rose) – which sold five million copies in the UK alone. Another £34million was raised from individual donations from a distressed public, community groups and companies. Donations included individual 50p pieces sent by pensioners. Later, a further £66million was raised through investments and commercial partnerships.Initially, many of the grants from the Fund were paid to organisations closely associated with the Princess, such as Great Ormond Street Hospital. But, in 2007, its directors and trustees – who include a campaigner against the Government’s benefit cuts – dramatically changed direction. Outrage: Diana's fund is said to have been hijacked to promote migration into the UK . Since then, the Memorial Fund has spent a total of £7,195,575 on 91 grants, made to 79 different organisations working on behalf of immigrants and asylum seekers. One of the biggest beneficiaries of this new strategy was the Changing Minds project, elements of which have received at least £820,0000. The Observatory has been paid £350,000 over the last three years. It does not mention Changing Minds in its self-description or output, and there has been little public mention of the ‘propaganda’ project. According to strategy documents written by the Diana Fund, Changing Minds exists to address ‘the plight of asylum seekers and their children in the UK by seeking to track, inform and influence public attitudes towards migrants, refugees and asylum seekers’. Not what she would have wanted: A close friend of the late Diana Rosa Monkton (left , sitting at the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain in Hyde Park, has blasted the latest revelations . But last year, a conference of the Association of Charitable Funders said the work was designed to achieve ‘attitudinal change’ on ‘negative attitudes’ to all migrants. It described changing attitudes towards migrants as an ‘example of the sort of “wicked” social problem that foundations are increasingly likely to encounter’. Opinion polls in Britain have repeatedly shown the public’s desire for a sharp reduction in net migration. This has infuriated the Left-wing establishment, which is a long-standing champion of large-scale economic migration. The Diana Fund supports Changing . Minds in tandem with a string of other charities and pro-immigration . organisations. They include the Barrow Cadbury Trust – itself a . recipient of a £40,000 grant from the Diana Fund so it could help fund . Changing Minds – and a New York-based group named Unbound Philanthropy. Unbound . Philanthropy, which has given the Observatory £342,000, says it wants . to ensure migrants ‘can ultimately thrive in a society that is . comfortable with the diversity and opportunity that immigration brings’. It is ploughing huge sums into pro-immigration groups – including the . Migrants’ Rights Network, the new British Future think-tank and  the . Observatory. Labour MP . Frank Field says the Observatory, part of the COMPAS think-tank at . Oxford University, has been set up ‘to try to undermine’ MigrationWatch, . a campaign group for stricter immigration controls. He . said it was ‘trying to use the status of Oxford University to peddle . Left-wing views on immigration’, adding: ‘People who gave money to the . Diana Fund would be very surprised to learn it has donated huge sums to a . propaganda effort to change public opinion on immigration.’ The . Observatory’s media advisory board includes Zoe Williams, a writer on . the Guardian, and David Walker. It is chaired by Mr Walker, a former . communications director at the Audit Commission and Guardian journalist, . who is married to Polly Toynbee – the paper’s leading columnist and a . vocal critic of the Royal Family. Pro-immigration: There is the feeling that Diana's work abroad have been blown into a falsehood that she wholeheartedly supported migration . On . the day of the wedding of Prince William to Kate Middleton, Miss . Toynbee described the event as Britain’s ‘Marie Antoinette moment’. Of . the day itself, she asked: ‘Is this what Britain is and who we are? Here . was a grand illusion, the old conspiracy to misrepresent us to . ourselves.’ Other . groups involved in the Changing Minds project include the . pro-immigration Institute for Public Policy Research, and the Migrants’ Rights Network. Both IPPR, an advocate of the benefits of economic . migration, and MRN get money from the Barrow Cadbury Trust. The . directors of the Fund, until it was wound up at the end of last year, . were headed by Lady Sarah McCorquodale, Diana’s eldest sister. Something fishy going on? The Observatory's media board is chaired by Guardian journalist David Walker . The . others were David Isaac, the former chairman of the gay rights campaign . group Stonewall, and Tahera Aanchawan. Mr Isaac is also a trustee of . British Future, another major player in Changing Minds and which itself . received £470,000 from the Diana Fund. Miss Aanchawan publicly signed a . petition for Iain Duncan Smith to live on £53 a week, as demanded by a . protester against benefit cuts. Sir . Roger Singleton, former chief executive at Barnado’s, stockbroker Terry . Hitchcock, Dr Diana Leat, described as a leading voluntary sector . researcher, and John Whitaker, who has worked within the charity sector . for 20 years, were the other directors. The different groups it has been . supporting are intrinsically linked. Don Flynn, a key figure in the . MRN, sits on the Observatory’s expert advisory board. The . Diana Fund was wound up at the end of 2012 and passed to the charitable . foundation set up for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince . Harry. A Palace spokesman said the foundation had not played any part in . the controversial grant-giving. He made clear any residual income . received for the Fund will go to the foundation – which will not . continue the Fund’s grant-making in any way. A . spokesman for the Migration Observatory said: ‘The Migration . Observatory was designed to provide accurate data and information to all . contributors to the migration debate. Our work has been used and cited . as a reliable source by politicians and newspapers across the political . spectrum, including in multiple stories in the Daily Mail. This is a . testament to our success in providing data and evidence that are useful, . accurate, and non-partisan.’ Sir . Roger Singleton said of Frank Field’s comments: ‘I am surprised to hear . that. It is not my understanding of what the Observatory is all about.’","Secret project saw hundreds of thousands of pounds towards pro-immigration campaigns .

"Pippa Middleton's jaunt in the Big Apple continued today as the Duchess of Cambridge's younger sister spent the afternoon skating with friends in a New York park. Pictured on the street outside The Carlyle, the Upper East Side hotel where she has been staying since she arrived at the weekend, Pippa made the most of the sunny weather Stateside. She has certainly made the most of her stay, packing a constant stream of glittering engagements into a few short days. This is how we roll! Pippa Middleton and two friends enjoy an iced coffee after a skating session in New York . Fit: Sporty Pippa dressed casually in a heart-print red top and pale jeans - and kept the sun off her face with an NYC cap . Last night she dined at fashionable Le . Bernardin restaurant, which brought to an end a heady few days where . she had been whisked out by private plane to the exclusive Hamptons . resort by one of the richest men in the country and enjoyed dinner at . some of the city’s top restaurants. Yesterday . the 28-year-old arrived at the US Open in Flushing Meadows with a . pass for the tennis courtesy of Wimbledon champion Roger Federer. Dressed in a colour block shift dress, . tortoiseshell shades and her favourite nude wedges, she looked every . inch the confident Park Avenue princess. There is speculation that party . planner Pippa, who is due to celebrate her 29th birthday on Thursday, . may also attend New York Fashion Week. Pippa – an assiduous networker who . once shared a flat with the sons of two Dukes – began her trip on . Saturday by checking in to the Upper East Side’s Carlyle Hotel (where . suites can cost up to £10,000) with a couple of girlfriends. High-profile guest: Pippa Middleton, pictured left in London, is in New York for meetings about her upcoming book and has been enjoying the company of millionair hotelier Andre Balazs, right . Travelling in style: Pippa and her friends were taken to Balazs' resort at the Hamptons on his seaplane, which costs $525 for a one-way trip or more than $3,200 to commission a personal flight . Luxury: They played pingpong and dined at his resort, Sunset Beach, on Shelter Island, pictured . High life: Pippa and two friends are reportedly staying at The Carlyle Hotel, where rooms start at $600 . Pippa . Middleton arrived in New York City this weekend and has enjoyed the . city's more luxurious perks, although it is unclear what exactly she has . paid for. Among her expenses: . The following day she met up with . fabulously rich hotelier Andre Balazs, who flew her on his pillar-box . red sea plane to his Sunset Beach boutique hotel on Shelter Island. Dressed in red jeans and a white . cleavage-enhancing shirt, Pippa was seen walking through the hotel, . laughing and giggling at the perma-tanned 55-year-old divorcee’s jokes. Balazs, who is said to be worth . £300million and has been romantically linked with Uma Thurman, owns . eight luxury hotels across the US including the Chateau Marmont in LA . and The Mercer in New York. He and Pippa were photographed playing . table tennis together and rode around in his cream and red VW van . snapping photographs with four companions. That night the group shared an . intimate dinner, with fellow diners saying there was a ‘definite . chemistry’ between Pippa and Balazs. ‘They didn’t seem like a couple but . there was a lot of flirting going on and when dinner ended he gave her a . friendly European-style double kiss on the cheek,’ said one. According to the New York Post, the . pair talked a great deal of ‘business’.  Pippa is, after all, about to . bring out her first book on entertaining entitled Celebrate: A Year of . Festivities for Families and Friends. ‘She shares his interest in hospitality,’ a source told the newspaper. When ‘fans’ recognised her, Pippa . apparently agreed to pose for pictures and was, by all accounts, ‘really . nice and very friendly’. There was no sign of her on-off . boyfriend Alex Loudon, who reportedly dumped Pippa last year after . becoming uncomfortable with the growing publicity around her. Friends . say that in recent months they have begun to slowly rekindle their . romance. After parting company with Balzas, Pippa made a trip to the Electric Room at Dream Downtown in the Meatpacking District, where she was seen chatting to former New York Ranger Sean Avery, the New York Daily News reported. 'She was only there for a short time,' a source told the paper, adding they were there with Mazdack Rassi, owner of photography company Milk Studios. She also reportedly met Gossip Girl actor Chase Crawford, 27, at the bar, with a witness telling Us Weekly the pair 'spoke for 10 minutes'. The trip to the beach-side resort . came a day after Pippa and two friends popped by their pricey Upper East . Side hotel, the Carlyle, where rooms cost as much as $15,000 a night. Stepping out: On Tuesday, Ms Middleton was pictured attending the U.S. Open tennis tournament in New York . They . went to Meatpacking District seafood hotspot Catch, where they enjoyed . Chef Hung Huynh's rice cakes, crispy shrimp, salmon carpaccio, scallop . dumplings and sushi, People reported. Just . over an hour later, Pippa, who was wearing a sleek green dress, went . for quiet drinks before hailing a cab and returning to the hotel. Pippa, who was pictured cheering . alongside her sister at the Wimbledon tournament earlier this year, also . squeezed in a spot of tennis as she visited the US Open on Tuesday. She wore a close-fitting orange, lime . green and navy blue knee-length dress - that showed off her famous . derriere - with a basket handbag and beige wedge heels as she arrived for the tournament. She finished off the outfit with a pair of £120 Bosworth Rosewood Sunglasses from FINLAY & CO. There is also speculation that Pippa might make an appearance at New York's . Fashion Week, which started on Monday at the Lincoln Center. The stylish set are keeping her name . on any show or party guest lists, should she wish to attend, the New . York Daily News reported. Former flame: Pippa Middleton was dating former England cricketer Alex Loudon until last November . New friends: Balazs previously dated comedian Chelsea Handler, left. Pippa was also reportedly seen chatting with former New York Rangers player Sean Avery, right, while out at a Meatpacking District bar . Dining out: Pippa and her friends enjoyed seafood at Catch, pictured, on Saturday after arriving in NYC . Her trip, during which she . is apparently courting the perks of fame, comes despite her demands to . remain out of the public gaze. While newspapers have respected her request to be recognised as a private citizen, she still very much seems to be enjoying the high-flying life of a socialite. Despite her request, US news sites chose to publish photographs of her playing table tennis with Balazs, but MailOnline has respected her wishes. Pippa is in town for meetings over her new book, which is out on October 30. She will not be holding any publicity events for the book while she is here, Viking publishers said. Billed . as a 'comprehensive seasonal guide to simple and creative . entertaining', it is a book she hopes will cement her credentials as a . party planner, and industry observers believe it could net her a small . fortune in the process. Into the spotlight: Pippa became a household name after her sister's wedding, right, last year. Even though she has requested privacy from the press, she has put out a new book featuring her picture, left . Connections: Pippa with her sister Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, while at Wimbledon earlier this year . The cover's patchwork quilt-style design of pictures of Pippa may come as a surprise to some readers, however, as Miss Middleton has strongly defended her right to privacy in recent years. Whether Miss Middleton will be able to maintain her position that she is a private citizen following the book's release remains to be seen. Her first tome is expected to generate much publicity, and it was reported last month that she has negotiated a six-figure book deal with publishers Michael Joseph, the branch of the Penguin Group that deals with ‘highly commercial’ properties. Miss Middleton's book deal has attracted criticism, with some observers accusing her of cashing in on her sister Kate's position as a senior Royal.","Duchess of Cambridge's younger sister spent afternoon at skate park .

"Prince Andrew came under renewed fire yesterday over his continued links with one of the most corrupt regimes in the world. His friendship with Azerbaijan’s billionaire dictator Ilham Aliyev was one reason why the duke stood down from his role as UK trade envoy last year. But it has emerged that last week he held a private meeting at Buckingham Palace with Britain’s ambassador to the oil-rich state. Questionable friendship: Prince Andrew (left) has faced criticism for his continued relationship with Azerbaijani despot Ilham Aliyev (right) since stepping down as the UK's trade envoy . Palace officials say his discussion with Peter Bateman was instigated by the diplomat. But the meeting raised fresh . questions about links with the former Soviet state’s president – who has . been accused of torturing political opponents and election rigging – . and angered critics of the regime. Natalia Nozadze of Amnesty . International said: ‘We can only hope that Prince Andrew, who no longer . has an official role in promoting trade, is instead using these . “private” talks at Buckingham Palace to persuade the ambassador to raise . serious concerns about the numerous human rights abuses in Azerbaijan. ‘These include the routine use of . excessive and brutal force by police, restrictions on public protest, . and the censorship imposed on bloggers and journalists who are beaten . and imprisoned for criticising the government.’ Andrew has visited Azerbaijan’s . leader, who is said to be a close friend, eight times in six years. His . dealings with the despot range from official trips and private holidays . to throwing a luncheon for president Aliyev at Buckingham Palace in . 2009. The Duke was forced to stand down as the UK's trade envoy in July 2011 amid a political storm over his friendship with US billionaire Jeffrey Epstein (right), a convicted sex offender . He even made a detour to the country . the following year on the way home from an official tour of the Middle . East just to attend a dinner held by the president. During one stay he . was reported to have visited a luxury spa owned by Mr Aliyev, which . employs a blind Russian masseur described as having ‘the best hands in . the world’. The regularity of Andrew’s visits to . Azerbaijan – where he is referred to as ‘the dear guest’ – has led to . speculation in the country’s media that he may have business links to . the state, including a golf resort on the Caspian Sea. However, . Buckingham Palace has denied this. The duke stood down as the UK’s . Special Representative for International Trade and Investment in July . 2011 amid a political storm over his friendship with US billionaire . Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender. Dogged by claims of lavish spending . as he jetted around the world, ‘Airmiles Andy’ was also criticised for . his friendships with leaders such as president Aliyev. Andrew in Azerbaijan in 2009 with Mr Aliyev's wife Mehriban . Andrew courted controversy last . November when, despite standing down from his globe-trotting trade role, . he made four taxpayer-funded foreign trips in eight weeks – including . an unexplained detour on a private jet for a visit to Azerbaijan. In January this year he provoked more . criticism during a trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, . Switzerland, where taxpayers faced a bill of almost £13,000 for his . eight-bedroom ski chalet.

He travelled there on a further three . occasions in a semi-official capacity.

"There was no mistaking where Prince William gets his dance moves from as he last night launched into an embarrassing routine in front of a giggling Duchess Of Cambridge. William entertained Kate and numerous onlookers by throwing a few shapes on a visit to Centrepoint’s Camberwell Foyer homeless centre in Camberwell, south-east London. He was chatting with resident Vanessa Boateng, 18, when he asked her whether the uniform he wore to his wedding looked 'dapper'. Scroll down for video . Just like his father: Prince William entertains the Duchess Of Cambridge and Vanessa Boateng, 18, by throwing a few shapes on a visit to Centrepoint's Camberwell Foyer homeless centre in south-east London yesterday . Giving his all: Prince Harry might have cringed at his older brother's urban dance moves . 'Nooooo,' she replied, 'your swag looked on point' - which is street slang for pretty damn good. William, 29, looked pleased as punch and started doing a hip-hop style . dance, brushing the shoulders of his jumper twice on each side. While it is likely his brother, Harry, would have cringed at his attempts, Kate and Vanessa both looked delighted. The prince was so chuffed at the reaction that he called Vanessa over to do it again at a reception later. He also let slip his and Kate's future plans when he discovered that his new friend was training to become a nursery nurse. 'He said he was going to make his children come and I could discipline them,' she revealed. 'He is fantastic, he is great, I love him... We are friends.' William's enthusiastic dancing was . reminiscent of his father Prince Charles's regular attempts to blend in . with local traditions via some questionable moves. In the groove: Prince Charles dances the samba with 20-year-old Nayara as he visits the Maguari Community's village in Brazil's Amazonian rainforest in 2009 . Most famously, during his first visit . to Brazil in 1978, Charles took to the dance floor with a Samba dancer . during a party staged by the mayor of Rio De Janeiro. And as recently as 2009, Charles was twirling with a scantily-clad village girl in the centre of the Amazon rainforest. William was already familiar with the . Camberwell centre he toured with his wife yesterday, having made a private . visit in 2003 when he was 21. The couple were suitably dressed down . for the occasion - Kate sported a . Ralph Lauren olive green jersey dress, clinched at her tiny waist with a . thick black belt, and knee-length black suede boots. The prince also . abandoned his habitual suit for blue cords and a jumper and shirt. During . their engagement the couple viewed a group session on Centrepoint’s . ‘Workwise’ programme, which enables participants to prepare themselves . in order to find a job. William and Kate also took part in a cookery class making low fat festive mince pies and gingerbread. In . organising the event shortly before they headed off for the . traditional royal Christmas at Sandringham, the royal couple were . following in the footsteps of Princess Diana. Affectionate: William offered his bride-of-eight-months a guiding hand during the visit .

"He can overcome any obstacle on screen with ease, but George Clooney must have been daunted by his latest real-life challenge: meeting his mother-in-law to be. But, strolling through the airport with her daughter Amal, 36, Baria Alamuddin, 66, looked in high spirits after the Oscar-winning actor flew her out to his villa on Lake Como, Italy. The visit comes two months after Clooney popped the question to Miss Alamuddin. Strolling through the airport with her daughter Amal, 36, Baria Alamuddin, 66, looked in high spirits after the Oscar-winning actor flew her out to his villa on Lake Como, Italy . The Hollywood star whisked Mrs Alamuddin out to his £25million holiday home – where the couple have been relaxing – for what is believed to be their first meeting. Clooney may be known for his relaxed charm but, given Mrs Alamuddin’s stature as an award-winning journalist, the long-time bachelor must have been braced for a grilling. However, Mrs Alamuddin – only 13 years Mr Clooney’s senior – is said to have enjoyed her time with the Hollywood star. While it was only a short overnight trip, a source told People magazine: ‘They were outside, and Amal and her mom were smiling. It was going pretty great. ‘Amal’s mom left the next day, and at the airport they just looked so happy.’ Amal is one of Mrs Alamuddin’s four children, along with her other daughter Tala and sons Samer and Ziad. She is the foreign editor of Al Hayat, a popular Arab newspaper, and has appeared numerous times as an expert on Middle Eastern affairs on CNN, Al-Jazeera, CNBC, the BBC and Sky News. The couple are believed to be planning a September wedding which is rumoured to be taking place in Italy . She has interviewed political figures ranging from former Egyptian president Hosni Moubarak to former prime ministers Tony Blair and Margaret Thatcher and was the last journalist to speak to Indian prime minister Indira Ghandi before she was assassinated. Along with her husband Ramzi – a retired professor of business studies at the American University of Beirut  – she fled her native Lebanon for the UK when Amal was two, escaping the civil war that raged in the country between 1975 and 1990. While Ramzi moved back to Lebanon in 1991, Baria – who was once described as the country’s answer to Elizabeth Taylor because of her striking looks – has remained in the UK and now lives on a leafy ave-nue in Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire. George Clooney’s mother, Nina, 74, has already met her daughter-in-law several times and is fully be-hind their relationship. She has previously said: ‘You can say I’m extremely happy. Amal’s a lovely girl. I like her very much.’ Prior to Mrs Alamuddin’s arrival, Mr Clooney and Miss Alamuddin had been enjoying a relaxing stay at the Oscar-winner’s £25million 30-room Italian villa. The source told People: ‘George and Amal looked very much in love all weekend. They were all smiles, holding hands. There was an air of romance.’ The couple are believed to be planning a September wedding which is rumoured to be taking place in Italy.","Baria Alamuddin, 66, looked in high spirits on arrival in Lake Como, Italy .

"Patrick Vieira expects another team to one day emulate Arsenal's Invincibles and go unbeaten throughout a full Barclays Premier League campaign. It is 10 years this month since the Gunners' incredible 49-game unbeaten streak was finally ended by title rivals Manchester United in an emotionally-charged showdown at Old Trafford. Arsene Wenger's men had not tasted a league defeat at all in the 2003-04 season and in doing so matched a feat which had only been achieved once before in the top flight - by the Preston side of 1888-89.

Former midfielder Vieira, who was speaking at Manchester's National Football Museum where he was being inducted into the English Hall of Fame, told Press Association Sport: 'Yes, I think it will be matched one day.

"Hairy Biker Si King has spoken for the first time of a ‘life or death’ dash to surgery after suffering a serious brain aneurysm. King, who presents the popular food show with Dave Myers, said he had battled severe headaches for four days before seeing a doctor three months ago. And the TV chef, 46, found himself being rushed into surgery. Now recovering at his home in Newcastle he said: ‘I thought, “Oh, my god, I am in trouble here”. So I went and had a procedure. It was a life or death thing. Scroll down for video . Si King, left, who has spoken for the first time after having emergency surgery for a serious brain aneurysm . ‘It was critical when I went into hospital but now it’s not. It’s good they have fixed it.’ He has nothing but praise for the staff at Newcastle’s Royal Victoria Infirmary, where he was rushed for treatment, saying: ‘They were the most incredible staff and it is an incredible hospital. Hats off to the NHS.’ Mr King is keeping in good spirits and while his weight is creeping up due to the incident – undoing his work to lose 3.5 stone on his Hairy Dieters series – he is exercising to keep help with his rehabilitation, cycling, gardening and walking at least two miles a day. In the deeply personal interview, he said his recovery is going well: ‘There have been no lasting effects – none that you’d notice other than I am slightly madder than I was before. No deficit, as they say’. Mr King, who is married with three children, said he was not quite ready to resume TV work with Myers, 56, who was a Strictly Come Dancing contestant last year. ‘I’m not back at work yet. I want to keep myself right,’ he said. ‘The last thing I want to do is fall over on a shoot. I want to make sure I am 100 per cent fit. And I’m getting there. ‘Dave just wants me to get better so we can get back on the road.’ Mr King, along with Dave Myers, have been making programmes under the banner of the Hairy Bikers since 2004, bridging the gap between a cookery show and a travelogue . Mr King told the Daily Mirror the only silver lining in the horrible ordeal is being able to spend more time with his wife Jane and three sons Alex, James and Dylan. And, as his TV commitment often keep him away from home for long periods of time, his wife is also enjoying having him around more too. He said: ‘She’s not fed up. I think she secretly quite likes it. We haven’t done it for such a long time. We go, “Oh, this is quite nice”. ‘I have been home for James, my middle son’s, birthday for the first time in four or five years. Those little family dos are very special at the moment.’ He has been making programmes under the banner of the Hairy Bikers since 2004, bridging the gap between a cookery show and a travelogue as he and Mr Myers drive around on their motorcycles. Mr King was working as a location manager and assistant director of projects such as the Harry Potter series when he met Mr Myers and says launching their show changed his life. He said: ‘It was great and we have never looked back. We have a loyal fanbase which we are very privi-leged and proud to have. ‘[Dave’s] great – we are like two brothers. He just wants me to get better so we can get back on the road.’ Their last show, The Hairy Bikers Asian Adventure, saw them travel around the continent trying local food.","Si King was rushed to hospital after suffering from severe headaches .

"Sales of DNA tests for everything from the risk of developing life-threatening diseases to catching out cheating partners are booming. The number of British websites offering home testing kits and services has doubled to 38 in just two years, research has revealed, with companies charging fees of up to £300. DIY paternity and genetic ancestry tests are the biggest sellers, however sales of tests claiming to reveal a predisposition to certain diseases are up 14 per cent a year. DIY: Paternity kits such as this one, being bought from a U.S. clinic, are among the most popular products . The revelation by Angelina Jolie that she had a double mastectomy because she had a greater genetic risk of developing breast cancer triggered a spike in tests. Genetic tests also now exist for a host of serious inherited illnesses, such as Huntington’s disease or Parkinsons. However, the advances open up potentially devastating consequences for people who get bad news about their risk of developing a fatal illness. Taking out life insurance to provide for loved ones or getting approval for a mortgage could become impossible if consumers are required to divulge information on application forms. Interest in ancestry testing has been sparked by endorsement from celebrities who claim it has allowed them to trace back their origins through the generations. For example, the actor Tom Conti spoke of his shock – and pleasure – on discovering, via DNA tests, that he is related to Napoleon. Comedian Eddie Izzard, meanwhile, made a TV programme about how he traced his family tree back 10,000 generations, with the help of DNA analysis. Sales spike: Angelina Jolie's revelation that she chose to have a double mastectomy because she had a genetic risk of breast cancer increased interest in testing kits . However, scientists have raised serious questions about the accuracy and value of such testing. DNA testing also has a more sordid side as seen on controversial TV programmes like ITV’s controversial Jeremy Kyle show, which uses DNA paternity tests as the main tool to settle family disputes. Some firms also allow customers who are suspicious of husbands or wives to send off underwear to discover whether other human DNA is present and if so, the number and gender of people found. There are also serious questions about the accuracy of DNA tests to establish a disease risk, which could mean consumers are being seriously misled about their health. The commercial potential of DNA testing has been identified by Anne Wojcicki, the wife of Google entrepreneur Sergey Brin. She is co-founder of a company called 23andMe , which is selling services and kits via mail order around the world, including the UK. A new British website – Dnatestingchoice.com – claims to offer a Trip Advisor style review system for DNA tests and websites selling them. It is the brainchild of biology scholar and online marketing expert, Craig Macpherson, who highlighted the fact that the Government supports the idea of creating an anonymised DNA genetic database of the nation to understand what the NHS should be spending its money on. Mr Macpherson said: ‘Our DNA is a map of our family history and in particular a key to understanding our risk of predisposition to certain diseases. ‘I share the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt’s view that Britain should become the first country in the world to routinely sequence people’s genomes to help the NHS plan for our futures. ‘This information is invaluable for helpings a new industry of genetic counsellors, which I believe is required, to recommend lifestyle changes and treatments to enable patients to stay healthy for longer.’ He added: ‘The internet is full of companies selling over 900 different tests with no standard pricing structure.  We aim to show people what is available and what are the best buy, allowing consumers to share their experiences and make informed choices after reading public and expert reviews alongside the very latest information on genetics.’ He said the most unusual genetic tests currently being offered include one that claims to find an ideal partner based on DNA characteristics. Testing of pets, to establish the breed mix, are also being offered. Many scientists are sceptical about the value of DIY home DNA testing, suggesting it could cause real harm. Dr Helen Wallace, of GeneWatch UK, said: ‘There are major concerns about the private genetic testing market. ‘It is unregulated, much of the information people get is misleading or unreliable and genetic tests are a poor predictor of the big killer diseases. ‘And there is also the danger of people receiving scary surprises without the presence of a doctor for which they are not prepared.’ The organisation Sense About Science has published a leaflet highlighting the pitfalls of using ancestry tests. Steve Jones, emeritus professor of genetics at University College London, said: ‘In a long trudge through history, two parents, four grandparents and so on, very soon everyone runs out of ancestors and has to share them. ‘As a result, almost every Briton is a descendent of Viking hordes, Roman legions, African migrants, Indian Brahmins, or anyone else they fancy.’ Mark Thomas, professor of evolutionary genetics at UCL, said: ‘Ancestry is complicated and very messy.  Genetics is even messier. The idea that we can read our ancestry directly from our genes is absurd. ‘This is business, and the business is genetic astrology.’","38 British websites now offer home testing kits - which can cost up to £300 .

"A thrillseeker has travelled the globe capturing the world's most exciting rollercoasters with his camera. With no big rides in Austria, Wolfgang Payer, 57, took time out of his office job in Vienna to travel the world on an amusement park tour. And the Austrian photographer found the perfect screaming subjects when he captured adrenaline-junkies riding the enormous 'Goliath,' at the Six Flags Over Georgia theme park in the US. Scroll down for video . Favourite shot: Wolfgang snapped this unusual viewpoint of the Goliath ride at Six Flags, Georgia . Standing 200ft tall, this monumental ride reaches speeds of 70mph and cost $11.8m (£20m) to build in 2005. Wolfgang says the shot of this ride is his favourite because of the innovative angle he captured. He said: 'It is not a normal view, it wasn't easy to take this photo and actually only a few people get the idea to take a photo like this. Reach for the sky: The Austrian has also visited Thorpe Park in the UK to ride the speed-coaster Stealth . Six Flags Over Texas has its own adrenaline-fuelled ride - the Titan hypercoaster which has a 255ft drop . 'When taking a photo, I look for a view which has never existed before.' While in America, Wolfgang visited Hershey Park in Pennsylvania. Taken on a glorious summers day, Wolfgang captured a stunning shot of the park's tallest and fastest ride, 'Skyrush.' He also made trips to amusement parks in Texas and New England. In a bid to seek more thrills, Wolfgang travelled to the UK and sampled some of the biggest rides Thorpe Park has to offer. He managed to catch thrill-seekers while they were on speed-coaster, 'Stealth', and the park's latest edition, 'The Swarm.'

The Austrian usually spends three to four hours in the theme parks taking around 30 pictures of each ride with his Nikon D800. Before taking pictures tries out the huge roller coasters, adding: 'Normally, at first I ride on the coaster one or two times and then I take the photos. 'After the ride, I have more of an idea of how to get the right photos. 'With a ride on a roller coaster I really know the machine and I can see the whole track.' He added: 'You must find your inspiration to take photos, whether they are of models, landscapes or roller coasters.' Riders hurtle along the swirling tracks of Six Flags New England's scariest ride . BUzzing success: The Swarm at Thorpe Park has been a favourite of thrillseekers since it opened in 2012 .

"Overdose: Scott Sterling, 32, pictured, was found dead after an apparent overdose . The son of billionaire Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling has been found dead at his home in Malibu. Detectives discovered the body of Scott Sterling, 32, on New Year's Day after they were called to his beachside apartment on Pacific Coast Highway at around 11:29 p.m. to check on his welfare. Police are blaming his death on an apparent drug overdose, though an autopsy is scheduled for Thursday to confirm the cause of death. According to the Los Angeles Times, . Sterling had not been seen for at least two days before his body was found alone at the lavish home, which property records show is one of thousands owned by his father. Sheriff’s Department spokesman Steve Whitmore said it would be several weeks before a cause of death is determined, pending toxicology tests. KTLA.com reported that Sterling had a drug problem and had been in and out of rehab. Neighbors told the TV station that the billionaire's son was trying to get clean. He also suffered diabetes, which may have been a factor in his death. It was not immediately known who reported the death to police, though reports suggest it was a friend. Scott Sterling made headlines in 1999, when he shot his 19-year-old childhood friend, Philip Scheid, who he claimed . attacked him with a knife. The incident, which was reportedly over 'Saved By The Bell: The New Class' actress Lindsey McKeon, happened at Donald Sterling's home on Beverly Drive in Beverly Hills, though neither he nor his wife were home at the time. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Crime scene: Los Angeles County Sheriff's officers were still investigating on Wednesday at the Malibu apartment, pictured, where Sterling's body was found . However, the 77-year-old was caught up in the shooting, with prosecutors citing the transcript of a phone call in which he seemingly attempted to intimidate or influence a detective. More than a year after the incident, prosecutors decided not to file charges, saying the victim was not credible, according to KTLA.com. The result frustrated police as . medical records showed that Scheid was shot from behind from at . least 15 feet away, yet Sterling claimed self-defense. 'No . rational person would entertain the possibility of his story being . true,' Beverly Hills Det. Sgt. Jack Douglas wrote in a memo to . prosecutors. Donald Sterling is a real estate mogul with $1.9 billion in assets, according to Forbes. He got into the basketball business . in 1981, when he paid $12.7 million for the San Diego Clippers and three years later moved the team to Los Angeles. Death: The son of billionaire Clippers owner Donald Sterling, pictured, has been found dead at a home in Malibu . Clippers: Donald Sterling, pictured right, bought the San Diego Clippers in 1981 and in 1984 moved them to LA . The . team has enjoyed little success ever since, but it currently owns the . best record in the NBA and became just the third squad in league history . to complete an undefeated month in December. Apart from his ownership of the Clippers, the elder Sterling has a somewhat sketchy past. The notoriously frugal billionaire has made headlines for a number of sexual harassment court cases and has also been sued for discrimination by tenants at one of the 150 buildings he owns across Los Angeles, Orange County, San Diego and Las Vegas. In 2003, 19 tenants at the Ardmore . Apartments in Beverly Hills and the nonprofit Housing Rights Center . brought a discrimination lawsuit against him, according to ESPN. According . to a testimony from a former property supervisor, Sterling was on a . mission to evict or push out any tenants that didn't 'fit his image.' The supervisor, Sumner Davenport, said that meant blacks, Mexican-Americans, children whom he called 'brats' and government-housing-subsidy recipients. Davenport said Sterling . refused to do repairs for black tenants and harassed them with surprise . inspections, threatening residents with eviction for alleged violations . of building rules. Home: Sterling's apartment, shown here from the back, belonged to his father, according to property records . Apartment: Detectives discovered Scott Sterling's body at an apartment on Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, pictured . He . refused to fix the apartment of an elderly blind woman after it flooded, she said. The woman asked for compensation for her ruined belongings, . to which, according to Davenport, Sterling responded: 'Is she one of . those black people that stink? I am not going to do that. Just evict the . bitch.' The dispute ended with a settlement in 2005 - the largest ever obtained in such a case, according to the judge. In 1996, a former employee named Christine Jaksy sued Sterling for sexual harassment. The two sides reached a . confidential settlement but according to testimony Jaksy gave under . oath, Sterling touched her in ways that made her uncomfortable and asked . her to visit friends of his for sex. Sterling also repeatedly ordered . her to find massage therapists to service him sexually. In another case, he was taken to court by a prostitute he had given a $1 million apartment to before taking it back. 'When you pay a woman for sex, you . are not together with her,' Sterling testified in 2003, according to . ESPN. 'You're paying her for a few moments to use her body for sex. Is . it clear? Is it clear?' While his father's character is questionable, a resident of the Malibu Beach Villas, where Scott Sterling was found dead, told the LA Times that the 32-year-old was a 'nice guy' who would wave when she saw him walking his dog. 'He said hello,' the neighbor said. 'It's a sad day here.' Another friend and neighbor described the man as 'intelligent and kind.'","Scott Sterling, 32, was discovered dead at his beachside apartment at around 11.30pm on New Year's Day .

"Australian holidaymakers have been warned to check the fine print on their travel insurance policies after a Perth woman was left to pay $135,000 for surgeries when she was shot in the face in the US. Amy Matthews was enjoying a night out on the famous bar and nightclub strip Bourbon Street in New Orleans when she was caught up in a shooting incident that left one dead and eight others injured. The 21-year-old university graduate from Mount Hawthorn in Perth is desperately trying to raise $135,000 to pay for a number of facial reconstruction surgeries and a new set of teeth, because her travel insurance does not cover the procedures. Ms Matthews told Daily Mail Australia her insurance policy for medical emergencies covered the cost of getting her 'fit to fly', but did not extend to the cosmetic and dental surgeries she requires. Scroll down for video . Amy Matthews, 21, was shot in the face in New Orleans in July. She split her tongue, shattered her jaw and lost all but 10 of her teeth . A victim lies in the streets of New Orleans after a shooter injured ten people in June . Justine Davies, spokeswoman for financial research company Canstar, said this was a little-known condition of 'unlimited medical cover' for travel insurance policies sold in Australia. 'Something that many travellers might be surprised about is that travel insurance is generally for emergency care only, such as accident or pain-relieving procedures,' Ms Davies said. 'The standard cover is basically to get you into a condition of health where you can either fly home or you're patched up to a certain extent. 'But of course there's a lot of medical treatment that is optional such as, for example, extensive dental work, or plastic surgery if you've suffered some sort of disfigurement.' Michelle Hutchison, Money Expert at comparison website finder.com.au said if a policy says it has 'unlimited' cover there can still be a catch. 'Some exclude unlimited medical cover for medical evacuations, funeral services, pregnancy, if you have been hospitalised or even been to a dentist before your trip,' Ms Hutchison said. 'Some also state that there is no ongoing cover if an appointed doctor deems that you're capable of returning home. Others also state that they won't cover your return flight home if you don't have a return ticket.' Ms Matthews was one of 10 people who were shot in the early hours of June 29. A 21-year-old US woman, Brittany Thomas, was killed. She was shot in the right cheek and the bullet exited from her upper lip. Ms Matthews lost all but 10 of her teeth, had to have her dead gums removed, her tongue stitched up and a metal plate inserted to support her shattered jaw. Ms Matthews said that if the bullet had hit her four centimetres higher or lower she likely would have died . The university graduate was enjoying a gap year holiday in the US when she got caught up in the incident on Bourbon Street which saw one girl killed and nine injured . She said that if the bullet had hit her four centimetres higher or lower she likely would have died. The 21-year-old was enjoying a night out on Bourbon Street when she heard a gunshot, then another, and then she saw people screaming and running so she started running too. After making it to the next street she stopped to take shelter when she noticed her face felt like it was on fire. 'We were in the main bars and clubs area and it was packed,' Ms Matthews told New Idea. One of the shooting suspects, Trung Le, is facing manslaughter and second degree murder charges . 'I never felt in any danger until I heard those shots.' Her mouth was filling up with blood and when she opened it a number of her teeth fell out. Two off-duty soldiers noticed she was severely injured and rushed to help her. Using their medical training Gunnery Sergeant William McDaniel and a Naval Corpsman named Josh looked after her for half and hour until an ambulance arrived. 'It was only when they started talking about entry and exit wounds I realised I'd been shot,' Ms Matthews said. 'It was pretty scary but I think I was in too much shock to scream.' Video footage of the street fight shows Ms Matthews and her friend walking past a bar on the busy street when gunshots send the crowd of people running. One of the shooting suspects, Trung Le, is facing manslaughter and second degree murder charges. He has pleaded not guilty. Last week in court a prosecutor acknowledged Le was not the person who shot and killed Ms Thomas. His attempted murder charge relates to his firing on another unidentified shooter. Almost three months since the shooting Ms Matthews is desperately trying to raise $135,000 to pay for multiple face reconstruction surgeries and a new set of teeth, because her travel insurance will not cover the procedures. 'It feels so unfair we have to pay for something someone did to me for absolutely no reason,' she told New Idea. But she has been overwhelmed by support from friends and total strangers since the tragic incident. A friend set up a Facebook page called Repair Amy's smile to help raise money for Ms Matthews' surgeries, and it has been flooded with get-well-soon wishes from New Orleans locals and others. 'I don't love the way I look but I can deal with it. I won't let this stop me. I'll go travelling again when I'm better,' she said.

"Thirty-something men invest more in beauty products than any other age group, spending three times more on anti-ageing beauty and indulgent treatments than going the gym. These metrosexual men spend more on male grooming products than those in their 20s and 50s combined, research reveals today. Pressures to maintain their looks paired with the influence of well-groomed celebrities such as Ryan Gosling and Brad Pitt are thought to have led to the recent increase in spending habits. Thirty-something men invest more in beauty products than any other age group, and David Beckham is cited as their top celebrity inspiration . The average 30-something man now admits to spending over £100 per month on expensive eye creams, luxury moisturisers and trips to the spa, which is three times as much as a standard gym membership. Of the 1,000 British men surveyed by Debenhams, those aged between 20-29 spent on average £35 per month on grooming products. The figure doubled for males in their 40s who spent an impressive £70, while those in their 50s seemed to have a more relaxed approach to male grooming at around £45 per month. The survey also revealed that men in their 30s were willing to spend up to £50 on a moisturiser and up to £40 on wrinkle busting eye creams. Clinique's Age Defence for Eyes, Elemis Deep Cleansing Facial Wash, Clarins Moisture Balm and YSL's Touche Éclat were rated as the most wanted beauty products. Women, in turn, reportedly spend just £11.12 on a moisturiser on average, according to a Superdrug study from September. The average thirty-something man now buys expensive eye creams and luxury moisturisers . Male respondents to the latest research also confessed they would purchase a male grooming product if it was endorsed by a celebrity with David Beckham, 38, ranking the highest in terms of influence. 'Our survey shows there is a steady increase in male grooming spending habits over the years.' said a spokesperson for Debenhams. 'In . your teens, grooming consists of a splash of water with a hint of soap - . if you're lucky. The introduction of electrical shavers and on the spot . treatment products in your mid-late twenties means there is a definite . increase in spending. 'But . it's all change as soon as you hit your 30's when the focus shifts to . products that maintain and prevent and money is no object. The spending . cycle declines at 50, almost returning to the amount spent in your 20's . as grooming takes a back seat and is seen as less of a priority and more . of a necessity.' The male UK skincare market is worth an estimated £600m and beauty experts at Debenhams believe this figure is set to rise as the festive season approaches and men scramble to look their best for office Christmas parties. 'The stigma associated with male grooming has finally disappeared and men are not only willing to spend money to maintain their looks, they are also recommending products to one another and frequently visiting salon's and spas, sometimes in groups' 'With the festive season drawing near, you will see a definite shift in the way men present themselves, look out for extra groomed eyebrows, glowing, flawless complexions and manicured nails.' British men are spending more time and money glamming up this party season than women. According to a new study by Travelodge, out today, men will be splashing an average £78.24 on grooming, clothing and beauty products for their festive night out - including make-up. Women are spending just £72.72 in turn. Men confessed they will also invest one hour and 28 minutes sprucing themselves up ahead of their big Christmas night out, whilst women will take just one hour and 16 minutes. One in ten men will wear make-up and 70 per cent of those will be using concealer . The study surveyed 2,500 British adults and found as 76 per cent are set to party this December - with the average reveller going to three Christmas dos. British men will be spending £35.49 on beauty products and treatments, more than women who will be forking out £34.15. More than one in ten (11 per cent) of British men are planning to wear make-up at their Christmas party this year - with 70 per cent of these men reporting that they will be using concealer. Another 61 per cent of make-up wearing men reported that they will be using lip gloss or balm. More than half (51 per cent) of make-up wearers will be using eyeliner in order to look good. Over a third (34 per cent) of men surveyed reported that they will be using a fake tanning product or have a spray tan to help them look healthier during the Christmas party season. The research also revealed that Northern men are the vainest when it comes to looking good at the Christmas party. Newcastle males will be spending the most money this party season, splashing an average £89.68 to look good for their Christmas party, and spending over an hour and a half getting ready. When it comes to spending time in front of the mirror, men in Manchester are the fussiest, taking one hour an 41 minutes to get ready. Mancunian men are also the most likely to wear make-up, with 14 per cent saying they will use some form of make-up this Christmas. Location . Average spend . % wearing make-up .

A wounded friend testified that Le likely saved his life after a still-unidentified man pointed a pistol at their group. 'I still feel like he's a hero, to this day.

Benvenuti was shot four times but survived wounds to his leg, foot and buttocks.

"The family of William Tyrell have penned a heart felt plea to help bring the toddler home, thanking everyone who has participated in the major search operation which is now entering its ninth day. Hundreds of gruelling man hours have spent scouring hectares of state forests, roads, residential and commercial properties around the NSW mid north coast town of Kendall - but still no clues have been found to suggest the whereabouts of 'Spiderman William.' And while the search must go on - his family say they are forever grateful for the way the tight-knit community and those from afar have banded together to help locate  try locate the boy who one day dreams of becoming a firefighter. Scroll down for video . Police said William's family are doing it very tough in light of the fact there has been no trace of him . 'It's emotionally distressing for them': Police say the search for William has taken a huge toll on his family . 'Thank you does not seem like the right sort of word to express our gratitude and heartfelt warmth we feel towards each and every one of you,' a statement from the family reads. 'We have been completely overwhelmed with the way the public, SES, Surf Life Saving, RFS and the Police have rallied together to find our little Spiderman William.' As the search enters its ninth day about 70 people are now concentrating on a section of bushland at Middle Brother area, 45km south of Port Macquarie. Equally as clueless about William's disappearance as is family, police Superintendent Paul Fehon said 'someone, somewhere' must know something about where William is. 'There must be someone out there who knows something about William’s unexplained disappearance,' he said. Immediate members of William's family have not been heard from publicly since the toddler disappeared from his grandmother's garden last Friday. A close friend, known only as Nicole, has spoken about the struggle and the toll the search has had on everyone- most notably the family. On Friday, police moved their inquiries onto the region's roads to stop and quiz motorists whether they'd seen any suspicious vehicles the time that William went missing. But like those that went before it, the questioning uncovered no trace of William or any leads into his mysterious disappearance. Now all the family ask is that their son be 'desperately' brought home. Friends of the Tyrell family have said how hard the week has been on everyone taking part in the search . 'William is a much-loved and cherished little boy,' said the friend of the family who wanted to be known only by her first name Nicole . It is now eight days since the Kendall boy missing as police confirm they are broadening their inquiries . The search has taken a huge toll on the SES and the family of William Tyrell said there work has not gon unnoticed . 'We have seen you day and night searching for William' a statement from the Tyrell family reads . Police  stopped passers-by as they investigated the disappearance of missing toddler William Tyrell last seen at his grandmother's home in Kendall . The eight-day search has  uncovered no trace of the toddler, who was last seen in the garden of his grandmother's property on Beneroon Drive . Police hope questioning  motorists will help locate any suspicious vehicles seen in the Kendall area . The massive search shifted from bushland near his grandmother's home to a state forest nearby on Thursday . Police are trying to trace  the movements of motor vehicles which were seen in the area last Friday . 'William is only three years and three-months-old and really still a baby, he has so many more years to live and we desperately want him home.' 'Up until a month ago (he) was obsessed with all things Fire Engine and would tell us his name was “Firefighter William”… a future he deserves to fulfil.' Mr Fehon earlier earlier said that William's family were struggling with the fact that there were still no leads in relation to his whereabouts - and this plea confirms their frustration. 'They are doing it very tough,' he said. State Emergency Service crews and police searched roadsides in the nearby Middle Brother State Forest last week for evidence as they focused on the possibility William was picked up by a car. More than 200 volunteers and residents have scoured kilometres of bush surrounding the property in the eight days since he disappeared. A number of tips, including reports that a 'well-dressed, well-spoken' man stopped at a local shop on Friday morning to ask directions to Batar Creek Road, which leads to Benaroon Drive where William was last seen, have uncovered nothing. Forensic tests performed on a patch of blood found near a creek just over 2km from William's grandmother's house were also negative. Test results showed it was not human blood. Bush trackers have found clues such as a knife sheath and a set of small footprints, but tip-offs from bush searches, investigations of CCTV and interviews with neighbours and local businesses have not uncovered a solid lead. But despite the lengthy search efforts Supt Fehon said police were aiming to broaden their investigation. 'We are following every possible avenue of inquiry that is being provided to us, be it CCTV, be it information regarding persons that may have been in the area, and we're asking the public if they know of anything to provide that information to Crime Stoppers,' he said. A special task force was set up on the fifth day of William's disappearance . The toddler was dressed in his favored Spiderman costume when he was last seen .

"Penis-shaped lollies have been taken off the shelves in New Zealand after a local father complained that they were 'offensive'. Barrie Aburn, from Dunedin on the South Island, was surprised when the mixed bag of lollies his young daughters bought him as a birthday present contained the lewd confectionery. Mr Aburn's partner Jacqui Hawkins was the first to notice them when she picked one randomly out of the bag of Dragon Sweets, The New Zealand Herald reported. Barrie Aburn, from Dunedin on the South Island, was surprised when the mixed bag of confectionery his young daughters bought him as a birthday present contained penis-shaped gummy lollies . 'I don't find anything amusing about it at all. I find it disgusting,' she said. The bag also contained gummy babies with penises. The Dragon Sweets were imported from China six weeks ago by confectionery company Dutch Rusk. Dutch Rusk managing director Willem Van de Geest said 7200 bags of mixed gummy lollies were distributed around the South Island, but said he was unaware they contained the inappropriate sweets. They have since been recalled. The Dragon Sweets were imported from China six weeks ago by confectionery company Dutch Rusk .

Mr Van de Geest added that the lollies would not be considered offensive in Asia, where the shape is a sign of health and fertility. 'They wouldn't even blink an eyelid. We see it as offensive.

"A six-month old baby girl has died from meningococcal disease in Adelaide and four other people have been diagnosed with the infection this month. A one-year-old, two-year-old, and two women in their 40s have been identified as the other four SA patients battling the disease. South Australia Health has issued a public health warning after the tragic death on Monday and a spike in cases of meningococcal, including 16 so far in 2014, compared to 17 at the same time last year. A six-month-old baby girl has died from meningococcal disease. This photograph show a baby with a meningococcal septicaemia rash . Chief Public Health Officer Dr Stephen Christley said that 'meningococcal infection numbers tend to be higher when there are more respiratory infections around, such as influenza'. Dr Stephen Christley, Chief Public Health Officer for South Australia Health, issued a warning about meningococcal disease on Thursday . 'As we have experienced increased numbers of cases in the past few weeks we're asking the general public to be aware of the symptoms of meningococcal disease and seek medical advice if necessary,' Dr Christley said. Around 10 per cent of the population carry the meningococcus bacteria around in the nose and throat of but it is usually harmless. Dr Christley issued a reminder on the symptoms, stating they 'may include fever, headache, vomiting, stiff neck and sore muscles, followed in some cases by a rash of red and purple spots'. 'Babies or young children with meningococcal infection may also be fretful, refuse feeds or be difficult to wake,' he added. People who are particularly at risk in SA will be given antibiotic chemoprophylaxis as a preventative measure. Meningococcal bacteria can cause meningitis, an infection of the membranes covering the spinal cord and brain, and septicaemia, an infection in the bloodstream . The infection can develop quickly and lead to serious illness or even death. Early diagnosis and emergency treatment with antibiotics are vital. Across Australia, over 250 cases of meningococcal disease are diagnosed each year. Most most cases are seen in infants, young children, teenagers and young adults but people of any age can be infected. Symptons 'may include fever, headache, vomiting, stiff neck and sore muscles, followed in some cases by a rash of red and purple spots' The infection can develop quickly and lead to serious illness or even death . In August, Daily Mail Australia revealed how a Sunshine Coast toddler, who was just 13 months old when he contracted the disease and spent two and a half weeks in a coma fighting for his life, has taken his first ever steps after doctors fit him with a new set of prosthetic legs. Brave little meningococcal survivor Finn Smith, now 22 months old, had to have both feet and one of his hands amputated after they were badly affected by bruising. Last month he went to his final fitting at Sunshine Orthopaedic Services in Nambour where prosthetist Dewet Heyns gave Finn his 'click clicks' - the nickname the toddler has given his new legs because of the clicking noise they make when he puts them on. On November 22 last year Sunshine Coast toddler Finn Smith was raced to hospital he was given antibiotics to fight the meningococcal, but all of his internal organs had shut down and he went into a coma for two and a half weeks . Finn Smith has made a remarkable recovery and now has new legs . Finn's mother Sarah Smith said she had to hold back tears as she watched him take his first steps forward with the aid of a walking frame. 'It just gives me that hope that he'll be able to do everything he would have been able to do before the illness,' Ms Smith said. Finn's new legs mark an important step in his recovery journey, but it has been a long nine months for his parents Sarah and Jason Smith. On the night of November 21 last year, Finn had been up all night with flu-like symptoms and every once in a while he would get the shakes. Finn calls the legs his 'click clicks' because of the clicking noise they make when he puts them on . The couple had an on-call doctor visit at 1am, who diagnosed him with a viral infection and told them to get him antibiotics in the morning. The next day during a car trip to Brisbane, they noticed three bruise-like dots on his forehead. They raced to the nearest hospital, which was seven minutes away at Redcliffe, and when they arrived Finn was admitted straight away. 'Within half an hour he was pretty much unrecognisable,' Ms Smith told Daily Mail Australia. Finn was crying tears of blood, blood was coming out of his mouth and his body had puffed up. 'The meningococcal had done its incubation time the night before,' she added. 'You don't know until the spots come out and once the rash comes out the damage is done - your little boy is fighting for his life.'","Baby girl died on Monday in Adelaide, SA .

"Denver Marchant was the police officer in charge of the crime scene in 1965 when a dead baby was found packed and posted to Darwin in the mail . Almost 50 years ago retired policeman Denver Marchant stood in a Darwin post office, investigating the shocking case of a dead newborn baby who had been posted in the mail. The case was never solved, but it always stayed in the back of Mr Marchant's mind. Last Friday, the 73-year-old who now lives in Queensland returned to Darwin for a rugby league reunion, and his partner Marilyn booked him into a hotel on Knuckey Street in the city centre. He was shocked. It was at the exact same address of the old post office, built on top of the crime scene of one of Darwin's most notorious cold cases. The scene unfolded on May 3 in 1965, when postal worker John Polishuk noticed a foul smell coming from a package that had been sent from 'JF Barnes' in Mentone, Victoria. He opened the uncollected package, sent to 'J Anderson', and was horrified to find a dead baby boy that still had part of his umbilical cord attached. For Mr Marchant, returning to the same spot so many years later brought all his old frustrations back. 'I've witnessed hundreds of post mortems over the years,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'But for some reason that one stuck with me because it was so bizarre. 'I guess it shocked us and something like that I think is unparalleled in Australia.' He has decided to speak out for only the second time since 1965 to reveal a new detail about the case, in the hope it will inspire someone to come forward with information that will solve it. The dead baby made headlines when it was discovered in 1965 . Melbourne and Darwin police worked together to try and solve the mystery . Clippings from museum archives show the inquiry into the babies death in the 1960's . Mr Marchant said the baby boy was found with a stocking wrapped tightly around his neck, ruling out the possibility that he was stillborn. 'It was as tight as you could get it, it took a long time to get it off,' Mr Marchant said. 'For that child to have been murdered it must have taken a breath. 'There was no reason to put that stocking around the child's neck if it was stillborn.' Mr Marchant also still has photos of the badly decomposed body, but he says they are too gruesome to make public. He remembers the day he got the call to attend an incident at the post office just 200m away from the police station in central Darwin. 'You just take your camera and walk down, you have no idea what you're going to find,' he said. 'When I got there the post office staff had already opened it up but not fully up, it was only partly opened. Mr Marchant pictured (left) in 1962 when he first started working for the Darwin police and (right) in 2013 . 'The first thing we did was put it in a plastic bag and send it straight to the morgue.' A couple of days later the post mortem was carried out, and Mr Marchant watched on but he suspected the doctor performing it was inexperienced. 'I got a feeling that the doctor had not done many post mortems,' he said. 'That's not decrying what the gentleman did, he did his best. 'It's probably a fair comment to say the doctor was very distressed - he was not a young man and my bet was he had kids as well.' The case was eventually passed onto Victorian police, because the crime was committed there and not in Darwin. Mr Marchant said many people had come up with theories over the years, but he thinks it was most likely a crime committed by a mother with post-natal depression. Inside the Darwin Central Hotel on Knuckey Street, which is built on top of the crime scene of one of Darwin's most notorious cold cases . He remained a superintendent in Darwin until 1995 when he retired, and spent some years as an advisor to the rural Papua New Guinean police before eventually settling in Hervey Bay in Queensland. Mr Marchant said times had changed since he was a police officer and he was aware that the public now is able to play a more active role in solving crime. 'At one stage policing was a closed shop and you didn't tell anyone anything,' he said. 'But with social media out there and all sorts of things you never know, it might jog someone's memory. 'You might have someone make a confession on their death bed – it's not likely but it can happen.' Mr Marchant is cautiously optimistic the case might get solved after all these years. 'You've got to remain positive with these things, you can't just say nothing will ever happen,' he said. 'I guess it's probably the copper in me but you really do like to see something happen. 'It's a matter of personal satisfaction.'","In 1965 postal worker John Polishuk opened a foul-smelling package .

"Police are scaling back their search for missing three year old William Tyrell and instead focus their efforts on how he might have disappeared. After nine days of scouring bushland in Kendall, NSW, emergency services and hundreds of volunteers from the town have failed to find any sign of the toddler, who vanished from his grandmother's property while wearing his favourite Spiderman costume. The focus will now move to examine the many pieces of information received concerning William's unexplained disappearance - all but giving up hope of finding his body. Scroll down for video . Police said William's family are doing it very tough in light of the fact there has been no trace of him . 'It's emotionally distressing for them': Police say the search for William has taken a huge toll on his family . The news comes a day after William's distraught parents broker their silence over the disappearance and penned a heartfelt plea to help bring the toddler home, thanking everyone who has participated in the major search operation. Hundreds of gruelling man hours have spent scouring hectares of state forests, roads, residential and commercial properties - but still no clues have been found to suggest the whereabouts of 'Spiderman William.' And while the search must go on - his family say they are forever grateful for the way the tight-knit community and those from afar have banded together to help locate  try locate the boy who one day dreams of becoming a firefighter. 'Thank you does not seem like the right sort of word to express our gratitude and heartfelt warmth we feel towards each and every one of you,' a statement from the family reads. 'We have been completely overwhelmed with the way the public, SES, Surf Life Saving, RFS and the Police have rallied together to find our little Spiderman William.' On day nine, about 70 people concentrated on a section of bushland at Middle Brother area, 45km south of Port Macquarie. Equally as clueless about William's disappearance as is family, police Superintendent Paul Fehon said 'someone, somewhere' must know something about where William is. 'There must be someone out there who knows something about William’s unexplained disappearance,' he said. Mr Fehon also paid tribute to the dedication and commitment shown by all those involved in the search as well as those individuals and businesses who provided food and support for the searches. Immediate members of William's family have not been heard from publicly since the toddler disappeared from his grandmother's garden last Friday. A close friend, known only as Nicole, has spoken about the struggle and the toll the search has had on everyone- most notably the family. On Friday, police moved their inquiries onto the region's roads to stop and quiz motorists whether they'd seen any suspicious vehicles the time that William went missing. But like those that went before it, the questioning uncovered no trace of William or any leads into his mysterious disappearance. Now all the family ask is that their son be 'desperately' brought home. Friends of the Tyrell family have said how hard the week has been on everyone taking part in the search . 'William is a much-loved and cherished little boy,' said the friend of the family who wanted to be known only by her first name Nicole . It is now eight days since the Kendall boy missing as police confirm they are broadening their inquiries . The search has taken a huge toll on the SES and the family of William Tyrell said there work has not gon unnoticed . 'We have seen you day and night searching for William' a statement from the Tyrell family reads . Police  stopped passers-by as they investigated the disappearance of missing toddler William Tyrell last seen at his grandmother's home in Kendall . The eight-day search has  uncovered no trace of the toddler, who was last seen in the garden of his grandmother's property on Beneroon Drive . Police hope questioning  motorists will help locate any suspicious vehicles seen in the Kendall area . The massive search shifted from bushland near his grandmother's home to a state forest nearby on Thursday . Police are trying to trace  the movements of motor vehicles which were seen in the area last Friday . 'William is only three years and three-months-old and really still a baby, he has so many more years to live and we desperately want him home.' 'Up until a month ago (he) was obsessed with all things Fire Engine and would tell us his name was “Firefighter William”… a future he deserves to fulfil.' Mr Fehon earlier earlier said that William's family were struggling with the fact that there were still no leads in relation to his whereabouts - and this plea confirms their frustration. 'They are doing it very tough,' he said. State Emergency Service crews and police searched roadsides in the nearby Middle Brother State Forest last week for evidence as they focused on the possibility William was picked up by a car. More than 200 volunteers and residents have scoured kilometres of bush surrounding the property in the eight days since he disappeared. A number of tips, including reports that a 'well-dressed, well-spoken' man stopped at a local shop on Friday morning to ask directions to Batar Creek Road, which leads to Benaroon Drive where William was last seen, have uncovered nothing. Forensic tests performed on a patch of blood found near a creek just over 2km from William's grandmother's house were also negative. Test results showed it was not human blood. Bush trackers have found clues such as a knife sheath and a set of small footprints, but tip-offs from bush searches, investigations of CCTV and interviews with neighbours and local businesses have not uncovered a solid lead. But despite the lengthy search efforts Supt Fehon said police were aiming to broaden their investigation. 'We are following every possible avenue of inquiry that is being provided to us, be it CCTV, be it information regarding persons that may have been in the area, and we're asking the public if they know of anything to provide that information to Crime Stoppers,' he said. Investigators repeat their appeal for anyone with information on William’s unexplained disappearance to contact them via Crime Stoppers. William has been described as being of Caucasian appearance with dark hair and hazel eyes. He was last seen wearing a Spider Man suit. A special task force was set up on the fifth day of William's disappearance . The toddler was dressed in his favored Spiderman costume when he was last seen .

"Simone Buchanan was just a teenager when her Hey Dad! co-star Sarah Monahan first told her she was being sexually abused. Robert Hughes' assault on young girls eventually became one of the most high profile cases of child sex abuse in Australian history, culminating in him being jailed for at least six years in May this year. But back in the late 1980s when Ms Monahan first confided in Ms Buchanan about what he was doing, Ms Buchanan was just 17 and didn't know what to do. Scroll down for video . Former Hey Dad! star Simone Buchanan posts a selfie for White Balloon Day's #whoRUprotecting campaign . Ms Buchanan (left) was just 17 when her co-star Sarah Monahan (right) confided in her about Robert Hughes' sex abuse. Ms Monahan is also an ambassador for child protection charity Bravehearts . 'In the early days when it was just this and that I'd say just ""Stay away from him"", that's all I could do,' she told Daily Mail Australia. Ms Buchanan, 46, tried to raise the issue with one of the show's producers, but says she was told to keep quiet about it. 'It was very, very grey,' she said. 'It was only later that it became more serious, and at my age it was not in my mind to go to police it was to go to my boss. I did what I thought was right.' Now a Bravehearts ambassador, Ms Buchanan is speaking out ahead of White Balloon Day on Friday to encourage others to take action if they suspect a child they know is being abused. 'I think a lot of victims don't speak up until they're adults,' she said. Hughes (pictured bottom left) was found guilty of 10 child sex offences committed between 1983 and 1991. He is pictured in a cast photo with Ms Monahan (bottom centre) and Ms Buchanan (bottom right) 'What [Hughes] was doing to the others girl was worse but we didn't know about that. 'It was really when Sarah came forward all these year later that they finally spoke out.' Hughes, 65, was sentenced to a maximum of 10 years and nine months in prison after he was found guilty of 10 child sex offences committed between 1983 and 1991, relating to four girls aged between seven and 15. Former Hey Dad! star Robert Hughes leaves the Downing Centre Courts in Sydney is July 2013 . His victims included the daughter of a family friend, who he touched inappropriately in her family swimming pool, and two of his daughter's friends, whom he exposed himself to or sexually assaulted as they lay in bed during sleepovers. Ms Buchanan is happy Hughes' trial is now behind her. 'It was a difficult time for everyone and I'm just glad that basically it is over,' she said. 'I think awareness has been raised through that particular time and I think it's just time that people realise just how prevalent [child sex abus] is and I think high profile cases like that help. 'What's come of this a lot of people have come forward, it has a ripple effect, and that's a positive thing.' Ms Buchanan says she is still friends with Ms Monahan following the ordeal. 'She's doing well, she supports Bravehearts as well, and she's trying to move on with her life and make this a positive like everyone else,' she said. Ms Buchanan said the whole experience has taught her how prevalent the issue of child sex abuse is. 'I had a lot of people write to me after the trial and tell me their stories,' she said. 'It's opened my eyes to how big the issue is and how massive the problem is globally, and it's been swept under the rug for so long.' Her advice to people who suspect a child they know is being sexually abused is to talk to them, or involve a third party counsellor. The cast of Hey Dad! on the set of A Current Affair in the wake of Robert Hughes being found guilty on child abuse charges . 'They're one step removed and sometimes that's easier,' she said. 'It's a difficult one because often these kids are too scared to speak out because the perpetrator has threatened them and the safety of their family members. 'If you are someone whose noticing it I think most definitely speak to that child and try and help them to open up.'

Crossbows, a firearm and electronic data were seized when about 180 Queensland Police and AFP Police officers executed the nine search warrants. AFP national manager counter terrorism Assistant Commissioner Neil Gaughan said police found no intelligence to suggest the two men were planning a terrorism attack in Australia. There was also no suggestion they were planning to target the G20 Summit which will be held in Brisbane this November. He said there were no other suspects in Australia in relation to the year-long investigation, codenamed Operation Bolton, but he said there were links to Syria and the investigation was ongoing.

Omar Succarieh, who is connected to the bookshop, is the brother of Australia's first suicide bomber to die in Syria, Ahmed Succarieh. The centre also raised money for two 'sermons' by Perth-based Islamic preacher Mohammed Junaid Thorne, who has posted support for terrorist group ISIS on social media and has been monitored by the federal government, The Courier Mail reported. The 25-year-old, who was deported from Saudi Arabia last year for protesting his older brother Shayden's imprisonment on terrorism-related offences, has previously been accused of being a radical preacher for allegedly praising militants responsible for beheadings and mass killings in Iraq in June. The centre reportedly raised money for 'sermons' by Perth-based preacher Mohammed Junaid Thorne, who has posted support for terrorist group ISIS on social media and has been monitored by the federal government . A centre Facebook post on September 6 rejected reports it was promoting extremism. 'Islam and this centre does NOT tolerate extremism but not what the disbelievers portray extremism is,' the post read. 'We do not discriminate either, so we have allowed many speakers to come and give lectures and share their views here.' Last month, the centre was a signatory to a statement from the wider Muslim community denouncing proposals to strengthen Australia's counter-terrorism measures. The Abbott government's proposed laws will make it easier for authorities to identify, charge and prosecute people who have been engaged in training, fighting or supporting terrorist activities overseas. A Facebook post made by the iQraa Islamic Centre (pictured) on September 6 rejected reports it was promoting extremism . The group statement, signed by iQraa and others, described the proposals as 'unjust and unjustified'. 'The primary basis of these laws is a trumped up 'threat' from 'radicalised' Muslims returning from Iraq or Syria,' the statement read. 'There is no solid evidence to substantiate this threat.'

"The makers of kitchen appliance Thermomix have finally responded to the global backlash they have received over the launch of a new model without warning their customers - including those in Australia - saying they were not allowed to pre-promote it as part of 'distribution arrangements'. Customers who recently purchased the old model TM31 for $1,939 say they feel tricked and would have waited to purchase the new generation TM5, which came out in Australia on Saturday and is only $50 more expensive, had they been informed. The older model is now $250 cheaper in Australia. In a statement to Daily Mail Australia, the manufacturer said they were 'deeply sorry' the September 6 launch had 'resulted in some of our very valuable customers feeling disappointed'. Scroll down for video . The new model Thermomix, which was released in Australia on Saturday, has 10 per cent more capacity and a touch screen . The company said it had not touted the coming product because the practice was 'in line with global brand compliance' and 'in accordance with our distribution arrangements which did not allow for any pre-promotion of the new product'. 'We value every one of our customers and recognise that this is not an ideal situation for everyone involved,' the statement said. 'We understand the position of our customers that recently purchased a TM31 and are taking this issue very seriously. 'The TM31 is and always will be an excellent appliance and will continue to be supported just as we have with the previous model the TM21 which is still supported today, ten years after its launch into the market.' Thermomix also added they were working on addressing the concerns of customers who had recently purchased a TM31 model and were committed to providing the best level of service to their 'very passionate customer base'. The Facebook pages of Thermomix in Australia, Thermomix UK, Thermomix Deutschland (Germany), Thermomix Spain, Thermomix Polska (Poland) and Thermomix France are among those that have been hit with complaints. Consumer group Choice spokesman Tom Godfrey said the organisation had been flooded with complaints. 'I think $1900 is a lot of dough to pay for an old mixer and clearly consumers can feel let down by Thermomix,' Mr Godfrey told Daily Mail Australia. 'We don't think they've broken any laws but clearly they have broken trust with a very loyal customer base and I think they're going to pay a price.' The German-designed 'twelve appliances in one' device has an almost cult-like following. They cannot be bought in stores, and shoppers hold 'Thermomix parties' similar to Tupperware parties where a Thermomix consultant comes out to a customer's home and demonstrates how it works to a group of their friends. There are more than 3000 Thermomix consultants across Australia. In Australia angry shoppers have set up a 'Thermomix unhappy customers' Facebook page which has almost 1,700 likes. Lea Fowler, 58, from Bullsbrook in Perth, feels misled by Thermomix . Others have complained to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and state Fair Trading departments, and a change.org petition started by Georgina Shelley from Brisbane has received more than 1,350 signatures. In her petition statement Ms Shelley claims customers and consultants were kept in the dark. 'Many like myself, asked the question before purchasing, if there was a new Thermomix on the way,' she wrote. 'My consultant told me that she hadn't heard anything about it.' She continued: 'Thermomix AU have misled customers by saying they didn't know about the new model and couldn't disclose this information to customers but as of Saturday when the new model was launched, they had updated their website and were holding training sessions around Australia for their sales teams, using the new TM5. To say they didn't know is an out and out lie.' Lea Fowler, 58, from Bullsbrook in Perth, bought a Thermomix for herself on August 4 and another for a friend on August 14. 'That really riles me because I've bought her a gift that's already an old model,' Ms Fowler told Daily Mail Australia. 'It's really frustrating, I had the consultant come out and I was very specific about asking her about new models.' Ms Fowler said customers like her are so angry because $2000 was a lot of money to spend. 'That's why they're copping so much flak, it's not that machine's not worth that kind of money, it's purely that they weren't transparent with what was coming into the market,' she said. 'It was a deception of Australian customers.' Ms Fowler said she spent years wanting a Thermomix before she finally bought one. 'If you're making risotto you chuck the onion, the butter and the garlic in and it chops the onion, sautés it with the garlic and then your add your rice and stock and set it to cook and it does it all,' she said. 'You come back after 10 minutes and it's done.' The old model TM31 is now retailing for $250 cheaper . Peta Sargent, 40, from Dee Why in Sydney, is an admin on the 'Thermomix unhappy customers' Facebook page and said some customers who ordered their device after August 20 had been offered a refund or upgrade to the new model. But Ms Sargent, who ordered hers on August 18, has been told she does not qualify. An email from Thermomix Customer Service told her: 'Your Thermomix consultant did not know about the new product at the time of your demonstration and has been presenting the Thermomix of proven quality and value. 'Decisions about the release of new models are not made by Thermomix but are made by our overseas manufacturer and are confidential until Thermomix in Australia are officially notified to release such information to Customers and the public.' It continued: 'The Thermomix Model 31 is an amazing kitchen appliance that will live up to all that you were shown at the demonstration which lead you to your purchase. 'I understand with all the talk and hype of a new model this can make you feel let down, but please think back to the reasons you purchased the Thermomix, as the TM31 has certainly not been superseded by the new model and will live up to all that it is designed to do as per your presentation.' An ad spruiking the new model claims it has 10 per cent more capacity, a new locking system 'for better handling', a touch screen, a new measuring cup and says it is quieter and more powerful than the old model. The company website claims home cooks can throw ingredients in their Thermomixes and are able make 'salads in 6 seconds', 'cake mix in 30 seconds', 'sauces and gravies in five minutes' and 'soups in 20 minutes'.","Makers of kitchen appliance Thermomix are facing a customer backlash .

"Emma Mullings, 33, from Mascot in Sydney's south east, conquered her battle with depression . On the surface, there was nothing wrong with Emma Mullings. She was 29 years old, had a supportive husband, two beautiful young children and an established career in the media. But every day Ms Mullings was fighting the desire to kill herself. She first realised something was seriously wrong when someone she knew committed suicide and her first thought was 'how did they do it?' 'Then I started Googling to find out more about how she had done it and I think that was the first time I thought ""Hang on Emma, this is not cool"",' Ms Mullings told Daily Mail Australia. 'But there was something about that point, I was in such a dark place that I thought if someone else can do it I can too.' Her husband Terrence noticed Ms Mullings was different, but she was too ashamed to talk to him about her depression or tell him how extreme it had gotten. 'I guess I didn't want to say it out loud, I felt like ""What's wrong with me, how can I even be having these thoughts?""' It had been six months of numbness, with Ms Mullings going through the motions at work and taking care of her children without really feeling present. Then one day at work a little Gmail chat icon popped up on her computer screen. Scroll down for video . Ms Mullings with her husband Terrence and her two children, whom she does not want to identify . When Ms Mullings was 29 years old she was constantly fighting the desire to kill herself. The idea of leaving her young children without a mother was the only thing stopping her . 'Hey, how are you today?' it read. It was her friend Tamara McDonald, who she had been close friends with in her early 20s, but had lost touch with since having children. At first Ms Mullings gave short, cheery but dishonest answers. 'I'm fine,' she would reply. But Ms McDonald was persistent, and kept checking in with Ms Mullings every day. 'It was pretty random, but if you ask her now she just says she felt like something wasn't right,' she said. Eventually Ms Mullings' replies became more honest. In the middle of her depression Ms Mullings' old friend Tamara McDonald asked her how she was out of the blue over Gmail chat . She lied at first, but they kept chatting and over the next four months Ms Mullings eventually told her friend about her suicidal thoughts . 'Because she was a chat icon it just felt safer,' she said. 'I think I just started saying things like, actually I'm finding things a bit challenging, sometimes I just feel really flat and I don't want to get out of bed.' Before long she had become brutally honest, and would say things like: 'I want to die the only thing that's stopping me is how it will affect my children'. Ms Mullings said up until that point, the idea of leaving her young children without a mother had been the only thing stopping her from acting on her suicidal thoughts. 'My mum died of cancer when I was four, so I was very aware of what that feels like.' But one night, about four months after Ms Mullings and Ms McDonald first started chatting, she had a dark dream. Emma Mullings pictured with author and TV presenter Tara Moss. Ms Mullings is a radio host and TV presenter . 'In my dream it was almost like I was making a strategy to commit suicide,' she said. 'Something was there telling me ""You can write them a letter explaining that mummy's mind is sick"".' The next day, she spoke to Ms McDonald and told her all about it. 'I was almost excited because finally I had a plan, and I had a way out,' she said. With her friend's support, Ms Mullings eventually sought counselling and conquered her battle with depression . This was the most serious that Ms Mullings had ever been, and Ms McDonald knew it was time to take action. 'She called my husband and booked me in to see someone,' Ms Mullings said. 'They were all things she was suggesting for ages but she just took the action.' Ms Mullings started seeing a counsellor, kept talking with her friend, and slowly her suicidal thoughts started to diffuse. 'It takes a lot of energy to push through but I just kept pushing through,' she said. 'I guess with her encouragement I felt like I had a renewed determination. 'I know it might sound weird but I know she had a lot of people praying for me, and it just slowly started to lift.' She started living a healthier, more active lifestyle and started choosing to banish negative thoughts from her head. In July 2012, after more than a year of counselling, it was her 31st birthday and Ms Mullings was sitting at a café with some of her closest girlfriends overlooking the beach at Manly when it struck her that she was feeling really positive and strong on the inside. 'That was the first time I thought wow, I actually made it out, I might be on the other side,' she said. Now 33, she is sharing her story ahead of R U OK Day on Thursday in the hope that she will inspire others who are battling with depression. 'I actually want them to know that they can get better, that it's not permanent,' she said. 'People say you'll always struggle with it and I actually don't believe that, I think you can get 100 per cent healed.' Now 33, she is sharing her story ahead of RUOK Day on Thursday in the hope that she will inspire others who are battling with depression . She also hopes to inspire those who suspect a friend or relative is suffering from depression, because it was so important for her to have someone constantly checking in . She also hopes to inspire those who suspect a friend or relative is suffering from depression, because it was so important for her to have someone constantly checking in. 'Once she cottoned on to what I was going through that she continued to follow up,' Ms Mullings said. 'Now that I'm out of it I feel like that was really clear and strategic, but at the time I was in such a cloud that I wasn't really aware.' Her advice is to simply start a conversation. 'Make it a safe space for them to be able to talk about how they're feeling,' she said. 'And be patient, even though sometimes it can be frustrating.

Extremists who hope to fight with the Islamic State but have already had their passport cancelled by ASIO are thought to be of high concern. 'It's like (they're saying), ""we've got to do something, we can't go to Syria"",' a source told the paper. 'It's gone beyond bravado, they are seriously talking about it.' On Tuesday, outgoing ASIO chief David Irvine said the spy organisation was actively considering raising Australia's terror threat level, from medium to high, for the first time in 11 years. Now it is believed the change will be put in place this week. On Thursday, Brisbane man Omar Succarieh, 31, appeared in court  accused of funding the terrorist organisation Jabhat al-Nusra in Syria. He is believed to be the brother of Ahmed Succarieh, an Australian reported to have committed a suicide bombing in Syria. Kruezi, 21, is also charged with recruiting people for incursions into Syria and weapons-related offences. Neither applied for bail and their cases were adjourned to October 17. Crossbows, a firearm and electronic data were seized when about 180 Queensland Police and AFP Police officers executed the nine search warrants . Police say there is no suggestion the men were planning a terrorist attack in Australia, nor was there any threat to the G20 Leaders Summit in Brisbane in November. On Thursday, Kruezi and Succarieh's lawyer Dan Rogers said he was in the process of taking instructions from his clients and requested both matters be adjourned to the commonwealth callover court. Both men were remanded in custody. A crossbow and a firearm were among items seized by officers from the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and Queensland Police during nine raids in Brisbane and Logan on Wednesday. The iQraa Islamic Centre in the Logan suburb of Underwood, which has come under fire for promoting extremist views, was among the premises searched following a year-long AFP investigation. On Wednesday, Immigration Minister Scott Morrison told ABC radio there was a 'specific' threat to Australia. 'I think these things get specific to Australia and I'm not at liberty to go beyond a statement such as that,' he said. 'The fact that there are Australians involved ... and there is ambitions that go well beyond just the establishment of the [Islamic] State and, as I said, there are many other terrorist organisations that fit under this umbrella of what is occurring in the Middle East.' One of four bullet holes is seen in the rear window of the iQraa Islamic Centre in Underwood, in Brisbane's south, on Wednesday . Police markings identify bullet holes at the iQraa Islamic Centre in Underwood . Former counter-terrorism NSW Police Detective Sergeant Peter Moroney, who was one of a group of investigators who monitored Australian terrorist Khaled Sharrouf when he lived in Sydney's west, told Daily Mail Australia in August that revoking suspects' passports is not the answer to preventing terrorism. 'It might stop them from going overseas and fighting but they can still plot attacks from Australia,' he said. Police carried out a raid at an Islamic bookstore, a gym and seven other premises in Logan and Brisbane on Wednesday. Crossbows, a firearm and electronic data were seized when about 180 Queensland Police and AFP Police officers executed the nine search warrants. AFP national manager counter terrorism Assistant Commissioner Neil Gaughan said police found no intelligence to suggest the two men were planning a terrorism attack in Australia. He said there were no other suspects in Australia in relation to the year-long investigation, codenamed Operation Bolton, but he said there were links to Syria and the investigation was ongoing. Australian Federal Police found the  bullet holes at the rear of the Islamic centre . Two men have been taken into custody following the raid at iQraa Islamic Centre on Logan Rd in Underwood . Police have also raided a Logan gym as well as seven homes in the area . Last year al-Qaeda released video of a man standing on a truck packed with explosives, claiming he was Australia's first suicide bomber . Australian Federal Police conducted a raid at iQraa Islamic Centre on Logan Rd in Underwood on Wednesday morning and bullet holes were found in one of the windows. The centre raised money for two 'sermons' by Perth-based Islamic preacher Mohammed Junaid Thorne, who has posted support for terrorist group ISIS on social media and has been monitored by the federal government, The Courier Mail reported. The 25-year-old, who was deported from Saudi Arabia last year for protesting his older brother Shayden's imprisonment on terrorism-related offences, has previously been accused of being a radical preacher for allegedly praising militants responsible for beheadings and mass killings in Iraq in June. The centre reportedly raised money for 'sermons' by Perth-based preacher Mohammed Junaid Thorne, who has posted support for terrorist group ISIS on social media and has been monitored by the federal government . A centre Facebook post on September 6 rejected reports it was promoting extremism. 'Islam and this centre does NOT tolerate extremism but not what the disbelievers portray extremism is,' the post read. 'We do not discriminate either, so we have allowed many speakers to come and give lectures and share their views here.' Last month, the centre was a signatory to a statement from the wider Muslim community denouncing proposals to strengthen Australia's counter-terrorism measures. The Abbott government's proposed laws will make it easier for authorities to identify, charge and prosecute people who have been engaged in training, fighting or supporting terrorist activities overseas. A Facebook post made by the iQraa Islamic Centre (pictured) on September 6 rejected reports it was promoting extremism . The group statement, signed by iQraa and others, described the proposals as 'unjust and unjustified'. 'The primary basis of these laws is a trumped up 'threat' from 'radicalised' Muslims returning from Iraq or Syria,' the statement read. 'There is no solid evidence to substantiate this threat.' The iQraa Islamic Centre is believed to have hosted a lecture this year on what followers should do if they were contacted by ASIO.

"The makers of kitchen appliance Thermomix are facing a global customer backlash with customers from Germany to the UK to Australia furious at the company after they released a new model without giving adequate warning. Customers who recently purchased the old model TM31 for $1939 say they feel tricked and would have waited to purchase the new model TM5, which came out in Australia Saturday and is only $50 more expensive, had they been informed. Thermomix has yet to respond publically to accusations they misled customers by telling them no new model was on the way, despite facing a growing international public relations nightmare. The Facebook pages of Thermomix in Australia, Thermomix UK, Thermomix Deutschland (Germany), Thermomix Spain, Thermomix Polska (Poland) and Thermomix France are among those that have been hit with complaints. Scroll down for video . The new model Thermomix, which was released in Australia on Saturday, has 10 per cent more capacity and a touch screen . The older model is now $250 cheaper in Australia. Consumer group Choice spokesman Tom Godfrey said the organisation had been flooded with complaints. 'I think $1900 is a lot of dough to pay for an old mixer and clearly consumers can feel let down by Thermomix,' Mr Godfrey told Daily Mail Australia. 'We don't think they've broken any laws but clearly they have broken trust with a very loyal customer base and I think they're going to pay a price.' The German-designed 'twelve appliances in one' device has an almost cult-like following. They cannot be bought in stores, and shoppers hold 'Thermomix parties' similar to Tupperware parties where a Thermomix consultant comes out to a customer's home and demonstrates how it works to a group of their friends. There are more than 3000 Thermomix consultants across Australia. In Australia angry shoppers have set up a 'Thermomix unhappy customers' Facebook page which has almost 1700 likes. Others have complained to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and state Fair Trading departments, and a change.org petition started by Georgina Shelley from Brisbane has received more than 1350 signatures. In her petition statement Ms Shelley claims customers and consultants were kept in the dark. 'Many like myself, asked the question before purchasing, if there was a new Thermomix on the way,' she wrote. 'My consultant told me that she hadn't heard anything about it.' Lea Fowler, 58, from Bullsbrook in Perth, feels misled by Thermomix . She continued: 'Thermomix AU have misled customers by saying they didn't know about the new model and couldn't disclose this information to customers but as of Saturday when the new model was launched, they had updated their website and were holding training sessions around Australia for their sales teams, using the new TM5. To say they didn't know is an out and out lie.' Lea Fowler, 58, from Bullsbrook in Perth, bought a Thermomix for herself on August 4 and another for a friend on August 14. 'That really riles me because I've bought her a gift that's already an old model,' Ms Fowler told Daily Mail Australia. 'It's really frustrating, I had the consultant come out and I was very specific about asking her about new models.' Ms Fowler said customers like her are so angry because $2000 was a lot of money to spend. 'That's why they're copping so much flak, it's not that machine's not worth that kind of money, it's purely that they weren't transparent with what was coming into the market,' she said. 'It was a deception of Australian customers.' Ms Fowler said she spent years wanting a Thermomix before she finally bought one. 'If you're making risotto you chuck the onion, the butter and the garlic in and it chops the onion, sautés it with the garlic and then your add your rice and stock and set it to cook and it does it all,' she said. 'You come back after 10 minutes and it's done.' The old model TM31 is now retailing for $250 cheaper . Peta Sargent, 40, from Dee Why in Sydney, is an admin on the 'Thermomix unhappy customers' Facebook page and said some customers who ordered their device after August 20 had been offered a refund or upgrade to the new model. But Ms Sargent, who ordered hers on August 18, has been told she does not qualify. An email from Thermomix Customer Service told her: 'Your Thermomix consultant did not know about the new product at the time of your demonstration and has been presenting the Thermomix of proven quality and value. 'Decisions about the release of new models are not made by Thermomix but are made by our overseas manufacturer and are confidential until Thermomix in Australia are officially notified to release such information to Customers and the public.' It continued: 'The Thermomix Model 31 is an amazing kitchen appliance that will live up to all that you were shown at the demonstration which lead you to your purchase. 'I understand with all the talk and hype of a new model this can make you feel let down, but please think back to the reasons you purchased the Thermomix, as the TM31 has certainly not been superseded by the new model and will live up to all that it is designed to do as per your presentation.' An ad spruiking the new model claims it has 10 per cent more capacity, a new locking system 'for better handling', a touch screen, a new measuring cup and says it is quieter and more powerful than the old model. The company website claims home cooks can throw ingredients in their Thermomixes and are able make 'salads in 6 seconds', 'cake mix in 30 seconds', 'sauces and gravies in five minutes' and 'soups in 20 minutes'. Daily Mail Australia has contacted Thermomix for comment.","Makers of kitchen appliance Thermomix are facing a customer backlash .

"A senior Belgium diplomat specialising in protocol has been arrested for tearing off the full-face veil of a Qatari princess after she asked him for directions. In the latest example of the difficulties involved in imposing a so-called ‘burka ban’, Jean-Marie Pire did not know the identity of the massively wealthy VIP before attacking her. She approached him with two other women in broad daylight in central Brussels last week, asking for directions to the famous Grand Place. Scroll down for video . Jean-Marie Pire, Chief of Protocol for the city of Brussels, allegedly left a woman with cuts and bruises after pulling the full-face veil, which is illegal in Belgium, from her face . The kind of full face veils favoured by some Muslim women are  banned in Belgium, just as they are in neighbouring countries including France. ‘I said I don’t talk to anyone if I can’t see their face,’ said Mr Pire. ‘With this reply, I wanted to make it clear that the veil is banned in Belgium. ‘Because the person asking me a question didn’t seem to hear me, I lifted her veil. I know I shouldn’t have done that, but what she did wasn’t legal either!’ The woman, who has not been named, said she suffered cuts and bruises after her earrings were violently dislodged, along with her veil. Stock image: A woman wears a full-face veil like the one Jean-Marie Pire ripped from the Qatari princess' face . She has made an official complaint to Brussels prosecutors, who may now charge Mr Pire with assault. The woman herself faces a fine of around £115 and up to seven days in prison for wearing the veil in public. Some onlookers have claimed that Mr Pire was drunk at the time of the incident, although he denies this, saying it was ‘three o’clock in the afternoon’, adding: ‘Besides, I don’t drink much.’ As the Chief of Protocol for the city of Brussels, one of Mr Pire’s main jobs is to welcome foreign dignitaries, including many from the Middle East. France, which is home to some five million Muslims, was the first European country to ban the full-face Islamic veil in public places in 2011. Belgium followed suit soon afterwards, and in December 2012 Belgium's Constitutional Court rejected appeals for the ban to be annulled, ruling that it did not violate human rights. There is no veil ban in Britain, but Conservative MP Philip Hollobone is among politicians who have called for one. ‘We will never have a fully functioning, fully integrated multi-cultural society if growing numbers of our citizens go around with their faces covered,’ Mr Hollobone said.","Jean-Marie Pire allegedly left the woman with cuts and bruises on her face .

"Gable Tostee was covered in scratches on his face and all over his body after having drunk and rough sex with New Zealand woman Warriena Wright on the night she died, court documents say. Documents tendered to the Brisbane Supreme Court on Monday state Tostee had marks on his face, neck, back, leg and hand when he was examined by forensic medical officer Dr Nelle van Buuren, the Courier Mail reported. This comes as a judge has said the charge of murder against Gold Coast man Gable Tostee is 'weak' and 'difficult' because the 28-year-old was not on the balcony when Warriena Wright plunged to her death from his Surfers Paradise apartment last month. Scroll down for video . New Zealand citizen Warriena Tagpuno Wright was on a two week holiday in Australia when she plunged 14 storeys to her death, after organising to meet with Gold Coast man Gable Tostee through dating app 'Tinder' Police documents allege that an audio recording from Tostee's phone reveal the sounds of a struggle, during which someone is choked and taunted. Tostee has been charged with Ms Wright's murder. Police documents have been filed in the Supreme Court ahead of Tostee's bail application on Monday . Considering Tostee's bail application in the Brisbane Supreme Court on Monday, Judge Debra Mullins asked Crown Prosecutor Sarah Farnden, 'The prosecution case is that the applicant wasn't on the balcony that Ms Wright fell from?'. 'That appears to be the most likely scenario,' Ms Farnden said. Police will allege Tostee and Ms Wright had violent sex, and afterward a scuffle took place inside his Gold Coast apartment before the 28-year-old forced Ms Wright onto his balcony and locked her out. Ms Wright then fell to her death. Tostee allegedly recorded over three hours of audio during the time he spent with Ms Wright, who he met via the dating app Tinder, on August 7 and in the early hours of August 8. Court documents also state that neighbours living in the apartments one and two floors below Tostee told police they heard 'thudding and scuffling' and loud bangs like furniture was being dropped on the floor on the night Ms Wright died. Gabriele Collyer-Wiedner, who lives on the floor under Tostee, said she woke up at 2am to the loud noises, the Courier Mail reported. 'A short time after that I heard a female person shout the words ""no, no, no"",' she said. Emergency crews at the scene of Ms Wright's death at the foot of the highrise Avalon apartments in Surfer's Paradise in Queensland, where Tostee resided. Ms Collyer-Wiedner told police she went out onto her balcony where she saw two legs dangling from above. 'The person did not say anything and neither did I,' she said. 'In a matter of seconds I saw the person fall from the balcony above mine... I screamed when the person was falling and I think that the person screamed as well.' Tostee has been in custody since mid-August when he was arrested and charged with murder. In court on Monday, Justice Mullins told the accused's barrister, Anthony Kimmins: 'If your client was not on the balcony, it makes the murder case a lot more difficult . 'But in the context of what happened in the apartment, I would think a manslaughter case is not weak.' Justice Mullins postponed the bail application, requesting more information after she read sworn statements by police, Tostee and Tostee's parents about his autism diagnosis. She said his previous diagnosis of being on the autism spectrum was referenced in the Crown's material, but was not addressed in defence documents. Tostee's high-rise apartment is investigated by detectives. The secret recordings ultimately led the police to arrest Tostee on August 15. Police have opposed bail for Tostee, saying he contacted more than 250 girls on Tinder in the months before he allegedly murdered Warriena Wright. Police say Tostee would immediately go back on Tinder if released and contact young women and, given his 'propensity of violence' would pose an 'unacceptable risk' to the community. A document filed in the bail application in the  says an examination of Tostee's mobile phone 'has identified that he has been in contact with over 250 female persons using the Tinder application since March 2014'. 'Police hold a strong belief that if Tostee is granted bail, he will recommence his using social media,' a document filed in the court said. 'Police believe Tostee's blatant disregard for human life and his propensity of violence displayed in this instance would place the safety of the community at an unacceptable risk.' Documents filed to the Supreme Court claim the Gold Coast man charged with murdering his New Zealand Tinder date told the young woman 'you're lucky I haven't thrown you off the balcony' before she plunged 14 storeys to her death. Ms Wright was a 26-year-old, visiting Australia for a two week trip to attend the wedding of friends . Tostee maintains his innocence and will fight the charge, after he was arrested on August 15 for Ms Wright's death on August 8. Documents, filed in the Supreme Court on Monday, allege a recording on Mr Tostee's phone captured three hours and 19 minutes of audio from the night that Warriena Tagpuno Wright died. The documents claim the recording started just before 1am, and 20 seconds into the recording a male voice says 'F*** me', Brisbane Times reported. Sounds of groaning can be heard, then the male tells the woman she is being too rough during sex, and says 'I don't like being beaten up'. The documents assert that an fight erupted at around 2.13am, and the male tells the woman 'That is enough. You have worn out your welcome. You have to leave.' The female, who sounds out of breath, says 'OK'. A male voice allegedly says: 'I thought you were kidding and i have taken enough. This is f***ing b***s***, you are lucky I haven't chucked you off my balcony you goddamn psycho little b****'. The male then tells her he is going to walk her out of his apartment without her belongings. She says 'I am so sorry' to which he replies 'I don't care'. There are sounds of a struggle and the male says 'Let it go' repeatedly before a metallic object is dropped. A door can be heard opening and the woman tells the male, 'no, no, no'. The male then says: 'You tried to kill me huh? Well why did you try and hit me with that huh? Shut your filthy mouth.' The woman then says 'No, no, no, no, no' repeatedly and a door is heard slamming shut. The female then says 'Just let me go home' before faint screaming is allegedly heard. A phone call is then reportedly made to a lawyer and to Tostee's father. Police claim that CCTV captures Tostee leaving the building. It is alleged that the Gold Coast man then ordered pizza within an hour of Ms Wright's death. Neighbours earlier reported hearing an altercation and the sound of a woman screaming at around 2:30am. Ms Wright and Tostee contacted each other through dating app Tinder and met in Cavill Mall in Surfers Paradise, before returning to Tostee's apartment. Ms Wright lived in New Zealand's Lower Hutt region and was in Australia for a two-week holiday to attend a wedding. Tostee maintains his innocence and says he will fight the charge.

"Marianne Faithfull has revealed her drug-dealing ex-boyfriend 'killed' legendary rockstar Jim Morrison by giving him heroin which was too strong. Mystery has long surrounded the death of The Doors lead singer after he suddenly collapsed and died in his Paris apartment in 1971. More than 40 years on, singer Faithfull has claimed that her then-partner - a drug dealer called Jean de Breteuil - supplied Morrison with drugs which  led to an overdose. In an interview with MOJO magazine, she said of de Breteuil: 'He went to see Jim Morrison and killed him. Scroll down for video . Marianne Faithfull has claimed her drug-dealing ex-boyfriend Jean de Breteuil (pictured here) supplied Jim Morrison with drugs which led to an overdose . Singer Marianne Faithfull (left) says her ex-boyfriend supplied  Jim Morrison (right) with heroin that was 'too strong' for the rock star hours before he collapsed and died . Faithfull was 24 at the time of Morrison's death and says she had travelled to Paris with her then-boyfriend, Jean de Breteuil, who visited Morrison's flat and supplied him with drugs . 'I mean I’m sure it was an accident. Poor B******d. The smack was too strong? Yeah, and he died. 'I didn’t know anything about this. Anyway, everybody connected to the death of this poor guy is dead now, except me.' Morrison was found dead in the bathtub of a rented flat on Rue Beautreillis in the Marais district of Paris aged just 27. An autopsy was never carried out on his body and the official French death certificate solely states he died of 'natural causes'. Faithfull, who was 24 at the time and was battling her own drug problems, said she had stayed away from the flat where Morrison lived and had taken some 'downers'. She added: 'I could intuitively feel trouble. I thought, I’ll take a few Tuinal and I won’t be there.' De Bruteuil himself died of an overdose later the same year in Morocco. Faithfull (right) was living in Soho and battling her own drug addiction at the time of Morrison's death . Faithfull, an ex-girlfriend of Rolling Stones frontman Sir Mick Jagger, said she did not witness the drugs' sale . Morrison had just finished recording what was to become The Door's most popular album, LA Woman, when he first arrived in the French capital in March 1971. He lived a notoriously wild life, abusing both alcohol and drugs, and soon became a regular at the Rock 'n' Roll Circus, a club frequented by the Beatles, Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix. In 2007, French-born former New York Times journalist Sam Bernett claimed Morrison died of a massive heroin overdose in the toilet of a nightclub he was managing, the Rock 'n' Roll Circus on the French capital's Left Bank. Bernett claimed the death was then covered up by two drug dealers who transferred Morrison's body from the club to the singer's apartment and dumped it in the bath. Ms Faithfull said De Breteuil told her he had to pay a visit to Morrison's apartment, but she chose to stay in her own hotel room taking 'downers'. 'I could intuitively feel trouble,' she said. 'I thought, I'll take a few Tuinal and I won't be there. And he went to see Jim Morrison and killed him. 'I mean I'm sure it was an accident. Poor b*****d. The smack was too strong? Yeah. And he died. And I didn't know anything about this. 'Anyway, everybody connected to the death of this poor guy is dead now. Except me.' Morrison was found on July 3 by his then girlfriend, Pamela Courson, who was played by Meg Ryan in the 1991 biopic about the incident called, The Doors. Val Kilmer played Morrison. Courson died of a heroin overdose in her apartment three years later, also aged 27, while Breteuil died of an overdose in 1971. Ms Faithfull, best known for her hit As Time Goes By, also spoke of singer Amy Winehouse, who also died aged 27, saying she was 'appalled' at the circumstances. 'Amy was very, very wary of me,' said Ms Faithfull. 'She knew that I knew and she didn't want me to say anything. 'There's a level of narcissism which is all mixed up with self-hatred. I know it well. It's like a glass wall between you and the world, so that all the love that everybody pours onto you, you don't feel it.' Ms Faithfull also co-wrote the song Sister Morphine, which is about heroin, with Jagger and guitarist Keith Richards. Twenty seven is a common age for rock stars who die young, with Nirvana front man Kurt Cobain, guitarist Jimi Hendrix, singer Janis Joplin and Rolling Stones founder Brian Jones all dying at the same age. Morrison is buried in Pere Lachaise cemetery in Paris – still a site of pilgrimage for thousands of music fans from all over the world, including many from the singer’s native America. Faithfull, now 67, still lives in Paris, and has a new album, Give My Love To London, out in September.","Legendary lead singer was found dead in bath of Paris flat in 1971 aged 27 .

"Australian jihadist Mohamed Elomar has warned on Facebook that the Islamic state will hold its position in Iraq and Syria 'by victory or martyrdom'. This comes as ASIO director-general David Irvine said he is seriously considering lifting the terrorism threat alert level in Australia because of the number of people returning from fighting in Iraq and Syria. Security agencies were aware of more than 20 people in Australia who had fought in the Middle East and posed a threat to national security, he told the ABC on Tuesday. Scroll down for video . Mohamed Elomar, a former boxer from western Sydney who left to fight in Syria late last year, poses with severed heads . Elomar said: 'Islamic State still holds its position either by victory or martyrdom' This comes as Elomar, a former boxer from western Sydney who left to fight in Syria late last year, dismissed US military operations in Iraq and Syria. When asked about media reports that Islamic State fighters are trying to return to their home countries, Elomar told News Corp: 'Maybe it's true, maybe it's propaganda. But Islamic State still holds its position either by victory or martyrdom. Besides, what can a bunch of planes do?' Director-General of Security David Irvine . Elomar, using the Facebook pseudonym 'Al Australi Abu Hafs', also claimed that American air strikes only 'hit civilians, not the Mujahideen'. He then began referencing Chapter 9 of the Quran, which contains the 'Verse of the Sword' passage terrorists often cite to justify jihad. 'And when the forbidden months have passed, kill the idolaters wherever you find them and take them prisoners, and beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them at every place of ambush. But if they repent and observe Prayer and pay the Zakat, then leave their way free. Surely, Allah is Most Forgiving, Merciful,' the verse reads. This comes as ASIO chief Irvine warned that the terrorism threat to Australia was now 'a very elevated level of medium'. 'I'm certainly contemplating very seriously the notion of lifting it higher because of the numbers of people that we are having to be concerned about here in Australia,' he said. Mohammad Ali Baryalei, a former Kings Cross bouncer who played a bit part in Underbelly, has been identified as a senior military commander in the Islamic State. He recruited Elomar . The 'medium' threat rating means a terrorist attack could occur in Australia and the 'high' level is used when government and agencies believe an attack is likely. Australia's four-level alert system goes to extreme, when an attack is imminent or has occurred. In announcing plans to strengthen anti-terrorism laws in August, Prime Minister Tony Abbott stressed the terrorist threat to Australia had not changed. Australia has been at the 'medium' alert level since the four-tier system was introduced in 2003. Mr Irvine retires at the end of this week. Khaled Sharrouf is wanted by the Australian Federal Police for alleged terrorist activities in the Middle East after he fled the country in December with Elomar on his brother's passport . He hands Australia's top security job to Duncan Lewis, a diplomat, former government national security adviser, defence department secretary and special forces soldier. Mr Irvine said Australia had been named as a target for several years in publications from al-Qaeda and other terrorist organisations. 'We are certainly aware of people wanting to conduct terrorist attacks in the West and in Australia,' he said. 'Whether it's a little bit more or a little bit less than 2001, I think we are facing a persistent threat.' Sharrouf posted a picture of himself posing with a severed head to Twitter .","Mohamed Elomar has warned the Islamic state will hold its position in Iraq and Syria 'by victory or martyrdom'

"Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy was recorded offering to meet Prince Albert of Monaco to 'set up' a plum job for a judge, it was today claimed. In telephone intercepts which allegedly expose the politician as a corrupt liar, the 59-year-old is heard speaking to his lawyer, Thierry Herzog. He is reportedly recorded telling him he will 'set up' Judge Gilbert Azibert with a well-paid job in Monaco in return for information about one of six corruption enquiries. Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy (left, with wife, Carla Bruni) was recorded offering to meet Prince Albert of Monaco (right, with wife Princess Charlene) to 'set up' a plum job for a judge, it was today claimed . Referring to Prince Albert II, the head of the tax haven on the French Riviera, he says: 'Call him today and tell him I will sort it out. I am going to Monaco and I will see the Prince.' It is the latest scandal for Mr Sarkozy who was arrested and charged with a number of corruption allegations on July 1. Judge: In telephone intercepts, the politician was reportedly heard saying he would 'set up' Judge Gilbert Azibert (above) with a well-paid job in Monaco . He faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted of the charges, which are related to accepting millions in illegal cash from benefactors, including the late Colonel Gaddafi. Speaking yesterday, Mr Sarkozy insisted he was the victim of a 'grotesque' set-up, saying that left-wing judges are trying to destroy his career. But today, Le Monde newspaper published extracts from telephone calls in which the politician reportedly tells Mr Herzog - who has also been charged with corruption - he will help out Judge Azibert in return for the information. The conversations apparently took place in February on a mobile phone Mr Sarkozy bought using a false name because he knew his calls were being tapped. Judge Azibert has already been charged with illegally passing on information in relation to an enquiry into money being received by billionaire L'Oreal heiress, Liliane Bettencourt. In another part of the phone tapes, Mr Sarkozy is also heard saying he will meet with Michel Roger, Monaco's chief of government. Mr Sarkozy later discovered that his phone was being bugged, and so did not end up sorting out the job for the judge, it was reported. Mr Herzog, meanwhile, can be heard telling the politician that he has 'access to unpublished information' on the so-called Bettencourt Affair, and had 'worked really hard' to get it.

"French police are losing their battle to clear hundreds of UK-bound illegal migrants from Calais, they admitted yesterday. It follows the arrest of up to 600 mainly young men in the Channel port on Wednesday by riot squads. Police used tear gas and batons in a dawn raid which ended up with a makeshift settlement being bulldozed. Scroll down for video . French policemen expel illegal migrants from their camp in Calais . Those taken into police custody had their personal details recorded, and were then offered advice about how to claim asylum in France. ‘The vast majority said they wanted to get to Britain, and in these circumstances there was very little else we can do,’ said a senior officer involved in the clear-out. ‘Most of those apprehended were released and allowed to get on their ways. ‘Many destroy their identify papers so we don’t even know who they are or where they come from.’ Technically, the migrants can be deported to their first European port of arrival, but in practice it is not worth the trouble as they just come back again. A spokesman for Alliance, the French police union, said: ‘Police don’t have the means to tackle the people-trafficking networks behind all this, and so the migrants will keep coming.’ Many of those apprehended on Wednesday had been staging a hunger striker ever since three other camps were destroyed in May. Denis Robin, the Prefect for the Pas-de-Calais, also admitted that the tough measures had not solved the problem. ‘The . Calais migrants are today in a geographic and judicial impasse,’ said . Mr Robin. ‘The British government will not let them break the law and . circumvent our security measures, and the migrants are not accepting the . measures we offer them.’ Up to 600 mainly young men were arrested in the Channel port of Calais on Wednesday by riot squads (file picture) Despite riot police doing everything possible to disperse the migrants, Mr Robin said around 900 were still hanging around his region, the vast majority in Calais itself. Despite action which has been attacked by human rights groups, Mr Denis insisted that the ‘French government is ready to hold out a hand, to make a national effort’ to help the migrants. He said any asylum demands would be ‘dealt with urgently’ and that ‘shelters would be offered’, although far away from Channel ports like Calais. Mr Denis insisted there would be no repeat of the Sangatte Red Cross refugee centre which acted as magnet for thousands of illegal migrants before being shut down in 2002. Charity workers helping refugees from wars in Syria and Afghanistan have reacted with outrage to the clear-outs, blaming them on a shift to the far-right in French politics. Most of the migrants play a nightly game of cat and mouse with the police and border officials as they try to reach Britain in the back of lorries. Once in the UK they will claim asylum, which entitles them to generous benefits, or disappear into the black economy. Calais Mayor Natacha Bouchart has long argued that Britain’s ‘generous welfare system’ is the real cause of the migrant crisis in her town.","French police admit they are losing the battle to clear UK-bound illegal migrants from Calais .

"Eight cavers were today missing inside a maze of Alpine tunnels and underground waterways likened to Hell. The men set off on Monday lunchtime to explore the Cuves de Sassenage, near the eastern French city of Grenoble. They were due back at midnight, but when they failed to return an emergency operation was launched by the local authorities. Emergency services near the entrance to caves in the French Alps where eight people went missing today . This afternoon specialist teams were using sound detectors and other equipment to try and locate the party, whose names and nationalities have not been released. The area is hugely popular with British tourists, including cavers and mountaineers, especially during the summer months. Rescuers working around the cave entrances feared that flooding may have caused problems for the cavers. A spokesman for the local Isere prefecture confirmed that an ‘emergency plan’ had been launched, and that rescuers were ‘at work’. He said there was ‘extreme concern’ for the men’s safety. He said all of the cavers were ‘highly experienced’, and had travelled to Sassenage, the nearest village to the caves, especially for the expedition. The area is hugely popular with British tourists, including cavers and mountaineers, especially during the summer months . Emergency: Eight cavers have gone missing in the Alpine tunnels known as the Cuves de Sassenage (pictured) Many parts of the limestone caves, which were fashioned by the underground river Germe over some 80 million years, are only accessibly through tiny gaps, which people have to squeeze through. The Cuves, or cisterns, are named after two giant ‘cauldrons’ worn into the rock at the caves entrance – the so-called Hell Gallery and Tomb Alley. Both are said to have inspired the Medieval Italian poet Dante in his description of Hell in the Divine Comedy. A class of school children went missing in the same place in 2002, but were later rescued. Cavers – or potholers as they are traditionally known in the UK – are encouraged to carry a range of equipment, including first aid kits and emergency supplies.","The men set off on Monday lunchtime to explore the Cuves de Sassenage .

"Furious: Nathalie Iannetta hit back at speculation that she only got a job advising Mr Hollande on the 2016 European football championships because the president is interested in her romantically . A sports presenter drafted in as advisor to the French government was yesterday the latest woman to be named a potential lover of the country’s bachelor president. Nathalie Iannetta, 42, is said to have got her prestigious role thanks to her closeness to the notoriously philandering Francois Hollande, 59. He infamously dumped his live-in-girlfriend earlier this year after being caught out cheating on her with a divorced TV actress. Now Mr Hollande is said to have had his eye turned by the glamorous Ms Iannetta, who is married with two children to Jean-Charles Sabattier, another Canal Plus sports reporter. But Ms Iannetta is furious at speculation that she only got a job advising Mr Hollande on the 2016 European football championships, which will be held in France, because the president is interested in her romantically. Ms Iannetta told Paris Match magazine: ‘I’ve probably got a lot of faults but I am faithful in every way. My family, my man, my children, they are the biggest success in my life.’ She was particularly annoyed at the way Paris Match noted her resemblance to Julie Gayet, the actress whom Mr Hollande left his then first lady Valerie Trierweiler for in January. Ms Iannetta first met Mr Hollande in a park 12 years ago, when they began talking about watching football. They have remained in touch ever since, with Ms Iannetta suggesting that Mr Hollande turn Euro 2016 into a feelgood factor before the 2017 presidential election. ‘We mustn’t get this event wrong,’ said Ms Iannetta. ‘We must use it to modernise French football and turn it into a shop window for what France can do.’ Such words hugely appealed to Mr Hollande, whose presidency to date has been an unmitigated disaster. The bumbling Socialist has noted how well France is doing in the World Cup in Brazil, and is hoping that there will be similar celebration in 2016. Former flame: Mr Hollande with then first lady Valerie Trierweiler in 2013. He left her for actress Julie Gayet. Now Mr Hollande is said to have had his eye turned by the glamorous Ms Iannetta . Socialist Party sources have indicated that Mr Hollande’s bachelor status will also lead to rumours about women like Ms Iannetta, who comes from an Italian background. ‘France is used to having a first lady, and it is perfectly acceptable that people speculate about who will be the next one,’ said one party member. Mr Hollande once lived with his current Ecology minister Segolene Royale, who is the mother of his four grown-up children, but dumped her for Ms Trierweiler. He also caused controversy by appointing a second woman, 45-year-old Laurence Boone, to his staff, as financial and economic adviser. Although she is known as an expert analyst, Ms Boone has infuriated leftwingers because she worked as chief economist for Europe with Bank of America, and for Barclays Capital, where she was chief French economist. Emmanuel Macron, a leading Socialist MP, said her appointment was a ‘two- fingered salute’ to the French left, many of whom despise the rich and wealth creation.","Married presenter Nathalie Iannetta, 42, is furious at speculation of an affair .

"Furious family members today continued to rally around alleged criminal Nicolas Sarkozy – but there has not been a word from his wife Carla Bruni. The 46-year-old former supermodel has not been seen since the former President of France was arrested and charged with a range of corruption allegations on Wednesday. It follows reports that Mr Sarkozy, 59, and his third wife, who is now a pop singer, have been experiencing problems in their marriage. Since being released from police custody following 15 hours of questioning, Mr Sarkozy has been out in public with his grown up sons, including visiting a Paris restaurant on Wednesday night. Scroll down for video . Corruption charges: Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy arriving with police by car at the financial investigation unit in Paris to be presented to a judge . Mr Sarkozy smiled and posed for photographs with supporters after appearing in a recorded TV broadcast in which he accused judges of trying to ‘destroy’ his reputation. But the normally massively high-profile Carla was nowhere to be seen. Instead it was left to her mother, Marisa Bruni Tedeschi, and his son, Louis, to speak up for the diminutive politician. Ms Bruni Tedeschi said judges had ‘cut the legs’ off Mr Sarkozy, adding: ‘The real scandal is the theatrical flourish – the means and the moment chosen to bring the accusations against Nicolas.’ She added: ‘Strange that the enquiry is happening now – it’s the moment chosen which suggests a vendetta…Those who are close to him are scandalised.’ The normally massively high-profile Carla was nowhere to be seen after her husband was arrested. She's pictured here leaving a hotel in Barcelona, Spain, on June 19 . Happier times: Sarkozy and supermodel-turned singer Carla Bruni pictured on a visit to the Pyramids in 2007 . His 17-year-old son, Louis, meanwhile, tweeted: 'They want to sabotage my father's comeback while France is in the s***.' According to a front page story in the latest edition of the glossy ‘Ici Paris’ (Here, Paris) magazine the former president and his one-time first lady are separating. ‘Carla and Nicolas: the end of a great story’ reads the splash headline, accompanied by gloomy looking pictures of the couple. Mr Sarkozy has accused judges of ‘humiliating me’ after being charged with 'active corruption', 'influence peddling', and 'violating the professional secrecy of an active judicial enquiry'. Now facing up to 10 years in prison and a £400,000 fine, he said France should not have to put up with left-wing judges who wanted to scupper his possible return to power. Furious: Ms Bruni Tedeschi said judges had ‘cut the legs’ off Mr Sarkozy . The Paris home Sarkozy shares with Ms Bruni was first raided by anti-corruption officers in 2012, within days of him losing that year’s presidential election to the Socialist Francois Hollande. There has been a steady stream of corruption allegations aimed at Sarkozy ever since, with Sarkozy’s lawyer, Thierry Herzog, and Azibert Gilbert, a judge implicated in the corruption case, also charged. Sarkozy, who was president for five years from 2007, is suspected of having tried to pervert the course of justice through his contacts in the judiciary He is said to have offered an attractive job in Monaco to Judge Azibert in return for inside information about the progress of the so-called Bettencourt affair. This was a case in which Sarkozy was accused of accepting millions in illegal cash from Liliane Bettencourt, the l’Oreal heiress and France’s richest woman, towards his election campaign in 2007. Investigators also believe Sarkozy was illegally tipped off that his phone was being tapped as part of investigations into another matter, the so-called Gaddafi Affair. This is said to have involved Sarkozy receiving millions more from the late Colonel Gaddafi – the former Libyan leader. Sarkozy, who was immune from prosecution while in office, insists that he is innocent of any wrong-doing.

"The legislation comes as opinion polls continually portray Mr Hollande as by far the most unpopular leader in the history of modern France . Workers in Socialist France can now ignore telephone calls and emails from their bosses when they are at home. It is all part of a new legal agreement which confirms President Francois Hollande’s country as arguably the laziest in Europe. As well as enshrining the 35-hour working week as a cornerstone of French life, his party has cut the retirement age by two years since coming to power two years ago. The French also enjoy six weeks paid leave, and extremely generous sick leave and striking rights. Now employers will no longer be allowed to contact staff during the 133 hours of the week designated for rest. It is all part of a new agreement signed by employers’ federations and trade unions in the digital and technology sectors. The law specifically makes it illegal for workers in the digital and consultancy sectors - including the French offices of Google, Facebook, Deloitte and PwC – to respond to emails or phone calls after 6pm. Staff will be ordered to switch off their work phones, and companies must ensure that their employees come under no pressure to look at work-related emails or documents on their devices. Strict French labour laws have already seen Apple fined for making staff in France work nights. This is because the law forbids shifts between 9pm and 6am unless the work plays an important role in the economy or is socially useful. Now the 35-hour week, introduced by the Socialists in 1999, has come under threat from the increasingly widespread use of smartphones and other mobile devices. The chairman of the General Confederation of Managers, Michel de la Force, said: ‘We must also measure digital working time. Even companies like Google are to adhere to the new laws regarding ignoring messages, e-mails and phonecalls from bosses . ‘We can admit extra work in exceptional circumstances but we must always come back to what is normal, which is to unplug, to stop being permanently at work.’ France is notorious for having a vast, pampered public sector enjoying some of the best civil servant benefits in the world. It comes as opinion polls continually portray Mr Hollande as by far the most unpopular leader in the history of modern France. This is mainly because of his disastrous economic policies, which have seen the unemployment rate soar above the 11 per cent mark. His entire government was forced to resign last month, with new ministers appointed in a reshuffle.","Employers not allowed to contact staff during the 133 hours of the week .

"A prominent lawyer has had his court-ordered payments to his ex-mother-in-law reduced so he can avoid going bankrupt, however last week a court heard he must instead pay contributions towards his ex-wife's rent and car repayments. High-profile Sydney barrister Alexander 'Sandy' Street is currently embroiled in an expensive dispute with his ex-wife Sally Street's mother, Helen Jenifer McDonald, over money she lent her daughter's  estranged husband when they were married. Mr Street was told in court despite having his payments to Ms McDonald reduced he must pay part of the rent on his ex-wife Sally Street's Watsons Bay apartment and $2000 per month towards the lease on her Porsche, Sydney Morning Herald report. The NSW Supreme Court heard Mr Street couldn't afford to pay his many debts if he was to continue paying the same contributions towards Ms Street's car loan and was granted permission to keep more of his barrister's income. Scroll down for video . Sally Street left a high-flying career as a lawyer to pursue her dream of being a jazz musician . Mr Street also said he was struggling to meet his Tax Office debt while also paying his credit card bills and child support payments to Ms Street. He now lives at home with his own mother and owes money to his own superannuation account and various other creditors. Mr Street is also obligated to pay $1300 per month to Ms Street in child support and $8600 towards his ex-wifes $1150 per week Watsons Bay apartment. In July a garnishee order which meant the entirety of Mr Street's income went to Ms McDonald was implemented so he could begin to pay back more than $500,000 he owed her. Changes to this were made recently so half of the barristers income goes towards to his $230,000 Tax Office debt and the remainder is distributed between Ms McDonald and himself. Mr Street admitted he borrowed money from his former mother-in-law to pay the mortgage on the Vaucluse home he shared with Ms Street, and believes his ex-wife should foot half the bill. However a court heard Ms Street is practically broke earning only $600 per month from Centrelink payments and an extra $200 for her musical performances after she gave up her career to raise the couple's children. The judge, Justice Harrison, said he wanted an outcome that meant all parties involved could survive financially. If this situation becomes a reality then it is likely that Sandy Street would not be able to pay Helen McDonald's judgment debt as he may face bankruptcy. It is likely that none of the parties would be able to meet their day-to-day costs of living', he said. Mr Street has been ordered to pay $2000 per month towards the lease on his ex-wife's Porsche . Earlier this year Ms Street - formerly a lawyer but now pursuing a career as a jazz singer - told Daily Mail Australia the messy legal dispute between her mother Helen Jenifer McDonald  and estranged husband has left her with no money in the bank and just $3 in her wallet. Ms McDonald is suing Mr Street for $836,989.39 plus damages over loans she says she made to him to help him pay the mortgage on his Vaucluse home, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. Following Ms Street's split from high-profile Sydney barrister Alexander 'Sandy' Street, SC last year, Ms Street's mother Helen Jenifer McDonald and her ex-husband have become embroiled in a legal battle over a disputed loan worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Mr Street is the son of former NSW Chief Justice Sir Laurence Street, and his grandfather and great-grandfather were also NSW Chief Justices. Ms Street says she is joined on the claim against her estranged husband 'as a matter of procedure' but insists that her mother is not suing her to force her to pay up. Appearing in court in July, Ms Street said she could not afford a lawyer and told Justice Peter Hamill she had zero dollars in the bank. 'I went and hawked a ring after the court proceedings,' Ms Street told Daily Mail Australia. Alexander 'Sandy' Street (left) and his father, former NSW Chief Justice Sir Laurence Street (right) Ms Street's estranged husband is being forced to sell his share in his barristers chambers in order to pay more than $500,000 he owes Ms Street's mother Helen Jenifer McDonald and a $230,000 tax bill. The NSW Supreme court ordered Mr Street to pay Ms McDonald $540,729.92 in May. In July Mr Street asked the court to stay a garnishee order which currently sees all his income paid to Ms McDonald, arguing he could not afford his repayments to the ATO, $1300 per month maintenance payments to Ms Street and his own living costs. Justice Peter Hamill agreed to stay the order until August 27, provided 50 per cent of his income goes to the ATO and his child support payments are covered. The remaining money is to be split 70:30 between Ms McDonald and Mr Street. In court on Tuesday Ms Street said she had been told her husband intends to stop paying maintenance payments to cover rent and bills when their divorce is finalised next month. Ms Street's estanged husband and mother are involved in a messy legal battle . Ms Street used to be half one of the Sydney law community's most high-profile couples, before her split from estranged husband Alexander 'Sandy' Street, SC, in September last year . 'Which mean I'll be out on the streets,' Ms Street told Justice Hamill. 'I have zero dollars in my bank account; I have $3 in my wallet.' Ms Street also said she could not afford a lawyer. Justice Hamill made a recommendation to the NSW Bar Association to provide her with legal advice. Ms Street – a former lawyer turned jazz and pop musician – said she did not know anything about litigation because when she practiced she was a mergers and acquisitions lawyer. She officially left the profession in 2007. Ms Street said she believed the judge's decision yesterday was 'unfair' because she was not allowed to sit in on negations which she said 'documents without any doubt affected my legal rights'. Ms Street's estranged husband is being forced to sell his share in his barristers chambers in order to pay more than $500,000 he owes Ms Street's mother Helen Jenifer McDonald . In the mid-2000s Ms Street was a senior associate at a top Sydney law firm specialising in private equity . 'They covered my child maintenance but completely disregarded any rent or bills,' she said. 'It's my livelihood that I have a roof over my head but I wasn't allowed to participate.' In the mid-2000s Ms Street was a senior associate at a top Sydney law firm specialising in private equity, working for clients such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. But her high-flying legal career is worlds away from her new occupation as a jazz and pop singer, which sees her playing regular live gigs in Sydney nightspots and singing 'flirty' songs on stage with her diamante-encrusted keytar.","Sally Street split from high-profile barrister 'Sandy' Street last year .

"The unelected ex-girlfriend of French president François Hollande was today made a senior minister in his government. Ségolène Royal’s appointment as Ecology and Energy Minster as part of a panicked reshuffle caused widespread astonishment and anger. Not only has the 60-year-old been widely rejected by the French people at recent elections, but she is a leading lady in the Hollande soap opera surrounding his personal life. An eye for the ladies: French actress Audrey Tautou meets François Hollande . A poll in a Parisian newspaper just before today’s announcement showed more than 70 per cent of French people were against Mlle Royal returning to power. M Hollande was barely allowed to speak to Mlle Royal, the mother of his four children, while he was living with his previous girlfriend, Valerie Trierweiler. The two women detested each other, but M Hollande effectively sacked Mlle Trierweiler in January after his secret affair with an actress was exposed. This paved the way for Mlle Royal’s appointment today, as part of a desperate attempt to change the fortunes of a failing administration. In government: Ségolène Royal’s appointment as Ecology and Energy Minster as part of a panicked reshuffle caused widespread astonishment and anger . France’s entire Socialist government resigned following meltdown in local elections on Sunday, when the far-right National Front made dramatic gains across the country. M Hollande’s immediate reaction was to sack his prime minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, 64, who had announced a ‘defeat for the government’. M Ayrault was replaced by Manuel Valls, the tough-talking former interior minister who is fiercely anti-immigration. M Valls, who was born in Barcelona, Spain, in 1962 and is on the right of his party, caused outrage in his own party last year when he said Roma gypsies ‘did not want to integrate’ and should be deported. Beyond the appointment of Mlle Royal, today’s reshuffle contained few surprises, with ministers such as Foreign Secretary Laurent Fabius keeping their previous jobs. Socialist mismanagement was blamed for more than 150 town halls swinging to opposition parties in the weekend’s local elections. Les femmes d'Hollande: Valérie Trierweiler (left) was the French president's live-in lover when he was elected; M Hollande's secret mistress Julie Gayet (right) is on the verge of being dumped say reports . Polls show that M Hollande is by far the most unpopular head of state in recent French history. There have been claims this month that he is on the verge of dumping his secret mistress, Julie Gayet, while spending more time with Mlle Royal. The unemployment rate in France is now above 11 per cent, with the cost of living also soaring. M Hollande has become synonymous with a top rate of income tax of 75 per cent, but this week pledged that his government would become more business friendly.","Hollande reshuffles government after disastrous election results .

"Day of defeat: Last night socialist President Francois Hollande admitted to mistakes and said his priority was now to cut taxes . France’s socialist prime minister resigned along with his entire government yesterday following a meltdown in local elections. Jean-Marc Ayrault admitted that a huge swing to the Right, including to the extremist National Front, was down to him and his Left-wing government. And last night socialist President Francois Hollande – whose rule has become synonymous with a 75 per cent top rate of income tax – admitted to mistakes and said his priority was now to cut taxes. The government’s resignation is a huge blow to the president, who was elected to a five-year term in 2012 but whose first two years in power have seen him become the most unpopular head of state in recent history. And it is an embarrassment for Ed Miliband, who has lauded the Paris government for its economic policies and its refusal to follow George Osborne’s austerity measures. While Britain’s economy is on the road to recovery, unemployment in France is at record levels and growth is sluggish. In a TV address to the nation last night President Hollande spoke of a ‘moral crisis’, adding: ‘It’s legitimate after what happened to change things.’ He said boosting the economy was now the priority and added: ‘It is essential for our country to produce more, to produce better, to produce French.’ Mr Hollande also said a key objective for the new government would be pursuing the so-called ‘responsibility pact’ to lower employers’ costs in order to spur job creation. Out: France's socialist prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault resigned along with his entire government yesterday . He also pledged to lower taxes and said France would have to persuade EU partners to take into account its efforts to boost the economy when examining its commitments to Brussels. Mr Hollande also confirmed a plan to cut 50billion euros in government spending. On a day of high drama in Paris, Mr Ayrault said: ‘There is no getting away from it – this vote is a defeat for the government. I take my part of the blame.’ All 38 of his ministerial colleagues also quit ahead of a government reshuffle. Blow: The government's resignation is a huge blow to Hollande, who was elected to a five-year term in 2012 . Mr Hollande replaced Mr Ayrault with . Manuel Valls, the tough-talking interior minister – the French version . of home secretary – who is fiercely anti-immigration. The president said . Mr Valls would lead a ‘combative government’. Mr Valls, 51, who was born in Spain, caused outrage in his own party last year when he said Roma gypsies ‘did not want to integrate’ and should be deported. 'Huge victory': France's far right National Front leader Marine Le Pen has seen unprecedented success - taking control of 11 key constituencies . He is the most popular socialist among conservatives. He wants, for example, to rethink the 35-hour working week, a socialist initiative. More than 150 town halls swung from the socialists to opposition parties in the weekend’s local elections. The far-Right National Front enjoyed unprecedented success – taking control of 11 key constituencies, and up to 1,200 municipal seats. Most gains were in areas of high unemployment and immigration. ‘This has been a huge victory for us,’ said National Front leader Marine Le Pen, who believes her party will do even better in the EU elections. She claimed Mr Valls was a ‘dangerous’ politician with ‘no respect for public freedoms’. The conservative UMP opposition also did well, winning towns which have been in socialist hands for decades. The only good news for the socialists was the election of Anne Hidalgo as first woman mayor of Paris. She pledged to turn the capital into a truly global city to rival London.","France's socialist prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault resigned yesterday .

"It doesn't seem that long since Manchester United's capitulation at Everton last April signalled the end of David Moyes' unhappy tenure at Manchester United. Now, as Everton prepare to visit Old Trafford on Sunday, it is perhaps time for Louis van Gaal's new United team to reveal its true self. Such has been the scale and speed of change since that awful day on Merseyside less than six months ago that only two players selected by Moyes at Goodison Park - David de Gea and Juan Mata - can expect to start on Sunday. Six members of the 18, meanwhile, no longer play for the club. It has been a remarkable period at Old Trafford. A club for which stability became a byword during Sir Alex Ferguson's years has perhaps not seen a time like it since the great Scot himself arrived in the mid-1980s and began dismantling what he believed had become a glorified social club under Ron Atkinson. It is time for Louis Van Gaal's team to start showing the 'philosophy' he has spoken about . Manchester United's last game against Everton was David Moyes' last match in charge . David Moyes (right) replaced Sir Alex Ferguson (left) in the United hot seat but only lasted 10 months in charge . Van Gaal has a top heavy team with a wealth of talent in attacking positions, but lacking in defensive options . On his arrival this summer, new United manager Louis van Gaal asked for a little time. Three months, he said, and, though we are not at that self-imposed deadline yet, it is perhaps time that we began to see a little more of a 'philosophy' that Van Gaal often talks about but has thus far not been convincingly revealed by his team's football. To look at United's first team these days is to look upon a forward line that can look as though it has been hewn from a fantasy football league. They can play like that, too, even if this weekend's line-up will miss Wayne Rooney through suspension and Ander Herrera through injury. United's first game post-transfer window was at home to QPR. Initially a game scheduled to feature supporter protests about a lack of spending, United's late flurry of August spending was ultimately reflected by a 4-0 victory featuring cameos from Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao. Elsewhere in their squad, though, United still look paper thin, especially at centre half. This has been reflected in a startling 5-3 defeat at Leicester (that sentence still doesn't sound right) and a 2-1 home win over West Ham that began vibrantly and ended with nerves shredded. Captain Wayne Rooney will miss out after he was sent off against West Ham on Saturday . Ander Herrera (left) will also miss out with a broken rib but 19-year-old Paddy McNair (right) will start his second successive first-team game . It's this contrast between performances that Van Gaal has not yet managed to reconcile. United can look a completely different team within the space one match, never mind one week, and the reasons for this go deeper than an injury crisis that once more found Van Gaal scrabbling around for fit defenders at Carrington on Friday. For all the technical quality of United's offensive players – Herrera in particular looks a fine footballer – United continue to have difficulties retaining possession for long periods. Ferguson used to talk about suffocating opponents with possession but that trait began to slip away during his later years and it's problem that went on to afflict Moyes' United and is now causing difficulties for Van Gaal. Against West Ham, for example, United were already beginning to pedal backwards prior to Rooney's sending off after an hour. A team that can look as devastating as any when it moves forward still spends too much time without the ball, despite the endless passing drills that Van Gaal asks his coaches to organise on a daily basis during first ream training. A very uncharacteristic Manchester United performance against Leicester City saw Van Gaal's side lose 5-3 having lead 3-1 . Manchester United players look dejected as the Red Devils lose to Leicester City at the King Power Stadium . 'I don't know when we will see a total of 90 minutes [good football] from the team,' said Van Gaal on Friday. 'You never know because it's a question of time. 'You will see for example in the first half against QPR, also in the first half in the last match, very attacking and creative football but I want to improve that we don't lose the ball so easily. 'That is our problem, not our defence. 'We are too easily losing the ball. 'That is the character of our team because we have a lot of creative players and they need more discipline. 'So we are looking for a balance in attacking football without thinking too much in only attacking but also guarding.' Perhaps United's venerable coach will not be able to fix this issue until another transfer window or two has passed. Maybe the return of Michael Carrick will help on the other side of the forthcoming international break. Whatever the case, with Everton's visit on Sunday followed by games against West Brom, Chelsea and Manchester City, it would appear that United's Barclays Premier League season is about to begin in earnest.

"Eric Cantona today spoke for the first time about his fight with a photographer outside a London pub, saying he was ‘used to it’. The 47-year-old retired French footballer turned actor was arrested and cautioned for assaulting the man on Wednesday. Cantona was back in Paris today, and told RTL radio it was ‘a simple fight with a paparazzi’, adding: ‘I’m used to it’. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

The Manchester United legend, who is . married with children, was particularly angry at references to an . attractive brunette pictured alongside him in the The Queens pub in . Primrose Hill. He said that the person he punched in the face was not just ‘a man’ but ‘a paparazzi’. ‘I had a fight with a paparazzi whom I considered too intrusive,’ said Cantona. ‘I . spent three, four hours at the police station and I returned to Paris . as planned. So they were bothering me, but I’m used to that.’ Football legend Eric Cantona is confronted by a police officer in North London yesterday .

Cantona has made a living as a model and actor since retiring from professional football in 1997 . Cantona . was upset that the incident was made to sound worse that it was, mainly . because nobody identified his victim as a photographer, but solely as . ‘a man’. ‘So we get into a fantasy’ said Cantona. ‘If it was that violent, I wouldn’t only have been kept for three to four hours.' Justifying . his decision to speak out, Cantona said: ‘It just allows me to clarify . things for my family and friends, and those who love me, who were very . concerned. You have to think about them sometimes.’ Cantona . did not mention the woman he was with, who did not speak to police and . who was later seen leaving the pub by a side door.

Cantona . lives with his second wife, the French actress-director Rachida Brakni, . 37, in the Paris suburb of Fontenay-sous-Bois. It is not known whether . she was in the pub. The couple, who have two children, a boy and a girl, met on the set of the film ‘l’Outremangeur’ (the Overeater) in 2003. Cantona has become well known for his philosophical one-liners. Here is a selection of some of his best:- . On . his achievements: 'I am searching for abstract ways of expressing . reality, abstract forms that will enlighten my own mystery.' On life: 'He who has regrets cannot look at himself in the mirror.' On his looks: 'If someone is too perfect they won't look good. Imperfection is important.' On education: 'I didn't study; I live.' On . his career: 'My best moment? I have a lot of good moments but the one I . prefer is when I kicked the hooligan (at Crystal Palace).' On Wednesday afternoon, Cantona appeared deep in conversation with the mystery woman as they drank beer in the sunshine. But police were called when he attacked the photographer, who did not require a doctor. A Metropolitan Police spokesman confirmed Cantona ‘was taken into custody and subsequently cautioned for common assault.’ Cantona . was convicted of assault in 1995 for a kung-fu attack on a Crystal . Palace fan who abused the player after he was sent off for kicking . defender Richard Shaw in a 1-1 draw at Selhurst Park, in south London. He received a two-week prison sentence, although that was later reduced to 120 hours community service on appeal.

"First lady Valerie Trierweiler is reported to be in hospital with depression following revelations of her husband's affair with an actress . French first lady Valerie Trierweiler was rushed to hospital following news of President Francois Hollande’s alleged affair, it was reported today. News of his apparent romantic liaisons with an actress made her so depressed when she first heard about it on Thursday that she immediately sought medical treatment. Today she was still in hospital, Le Parisien newspaper reported, citing sources close to the 48-year-old. They said she had been prescribed 'lots of rest' and was not likely to come out of hospital 'for a few days'. A spokeswoman for the first lady confirmed that Ms Trierweiler was admitted to hospital on Friday – the day Closer magazine came out. Ms Trierweiler was ‘undergoing tests’ and being ‘left to rest’, the spokeswoman added. Elysee Palace sources also confirmed the hospitilisation, saying Ms Trierweiler was likely to come out of the unnamed central Paris hospital on Monday. It came as a news poll showed the vast majority of French people want President Hollande to separate from Ms Trierweiler. This would result in her becoming the first Premiere Dame in history to be kicked out of the Elysee Palace. She would be replaced by Julie Gayet, a 41-year-old actress who has allegedly been conducting a secret affair with the Socialist head of state since last year. Le Point, the respected political weekly, is running an online poll which today shows 89 per cent of the French think Mr Hollande ‘should announce his separation from Valerie Trierweiler’. The figure reflects mounting anger that the already deeply unpopular Paris Match journalist continues to maintain her own office at the Elysee Palace, and ‘represent’ France abroad. MP Jean-Christophe Lagarde said: ‘She is not the wife of the president of the Republic, she plays the role of the first lady of France, when it appears that there is another first lady. The situation needs to be clarified very rapidly.’ Ms Trierweiler has made no formal comment since news of Mr Hollande’s apparent cheating was made public on Friday, but sources to her say she is ‘incensed and humiliated’ by the scandal. There are claims that she and Mr Hollande have been living separate lives for months, and that the president is keen to ‘formalise’ his relationship with Ms Gayet. This week French Closer magazine published pictures it claimed were of resident Francoise Hollande, Trierweiler's partner, sneaking into the apartment of Juliet Gayet . Mr Hollande’s relationship with Ms Gayet seemed to be exposed by a series of pictures in French Closer magazine which showed him travelling to see her on a moped. But beyond a new romance, opponents claim the scandal exposes publicly-funded deceit, security lapses, and the enormous cost of a first lady who no longer has any legitimacy. Mr Hollande, who turns 60 this year, was today said to be preparing a statement which would ‘clarify’ the position of Ms Trierweiler, a divorcee. She currently has five staff working for her at her own office, as well as numerous other taxpayer-funded perks, including homes across France, and private jets and limousines at her disposal. Catherine Nay, a leading political commentator and biographer, said ‘the question is whether Valerie Trierweiler can stay at the Elysee’, suggesting that her extreme ‘jealousy’ would make the current situation intolerable for all parties. Photographers who watched a Paris flat a few hundred yards from the Elysee for several days said Mr Hollande regularly met Ms Gayet there, always wearing a crash helmet while entering and leaving the building in a weak attempt at disguise. Julie Gayet, 41, who has starred in several racy films, is rumoured to be having an affair with president Holland . Laurence Piau, the editor of Closer magazine, which broke the story, joined other commentators in saying that Mr Hollande was ‘clearly in love’ with his new girlfriend, and wanted a future with her. Ms Gayet, who has two children with her estranged husband, 51-year-old Argentinian film director Santiago Amigorena, is very popular figure in France, having acted in around 20 films made for cinema and TV. Ms Trierweiler has, in turn, been a deeply controversial figure since moving into the Elysee following Mr Hollande’s presidential election win in 2012. Within a few months, she tweeted support for a politician standing in an election against Segolene Royal, the mother of Mr Hollande’s four children. Ms Trierweiler and Ms Royal are not on speaking terms – causing huge problems for Mr Hollande, who was said to have taken Ms Trierweiler on as mistress while still living with Ms Royal. It has also been well documented that Ms Trierweiler was at one stage still married when she became the shared mistress of both Mr Hollande and the conservative politician Patrick Devedjian. The magazine front page, along with six pages of lurid details, left Ms Trierweiler 'incensed and humiliated' Last year, businessman Xavier Kemlin made a formal criminal complaint against Ms Trierweiler, saying she was ‘embezzling’ public funds because she had no real status as first lady. However, judges later dismissed the allegation as being politically motivated. Ms Trierweiler, a political affairs journalist, has been on the staff of the glossy Paris Match magazine for most of her career, yet regularly takes legal action over her private life. Both Mr Hollande and Ms Gayet have pledged to take action over alleged breaches of privacy following the claims of their affair, though neither denies it. Today’s Le Point poll is based on 12,888 people being asked if Mr Hollande should announced his separation from Ms Trierweiler. 11,500 answered ‘yes’.","Valerie Trierweiler, the partner of French president Francois Holland, is said to be in hospital in Paris suffering from depression .

"Two French schoolboys have travelled to Syria to become Al Qaeda fighters, it emerged today. The 15-year-olds, from Toulouse, in the south west, are believed to be the youngest ever Jihadists to emerge from a country increasingly associated with Islamic radicalism. It comes after two British men were arrested in connection with Syria-related terror offences. Two French schoolboys (not pictured) have become the country's youngest Jihadists after joining Al Qaeda rebels fighting in Syria . Yusuf Sawar and Mohammed Ahmed, both 21, from Handsworth, Birmingham, have been charged with planning and travelling to Syria for terrorism. The French boys, who cannot be named for legal reasons, did not turn up for school on January 6, instead using a family credit card to fly to the war-torn Middle East. An increasingly radicalised group of rebels are trying to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad, who is accused of using poison gas against his own civilians . One of the boy's father launched an appeal for their return, saying his son had been lured into extremism on the internet. He told La Depeche newspaper: 'From the start of December, my son was brainwashed online. 'There were exchanges on Facebook, and he watched videos about the war in Syria. 'With his computer and on his phone, he was always on social media with his friend.' The father said he spoke with his son on Tuesday, saying: 'He said we wouldn't hear from him for a month, if he was still alive. 'He was with Al Qaeda fighters. During his last phone call to us, he was talking about the fighters as his brothers.' Thousands of foreigners have travelled to Syria since the Arab Spring revolt against President Bashir al-Assad in 2011 turned into a full-blown civil war. While pro-democracy campaigners originally led the uprising, it is now also involves Al Qaeda militia. Inspired by the late global terrorist Osama Bin Laden, they view al-Assad's regime as heretical. In his new year press conference last week, French president Francois Hollande said some 700 Frenchmen were suspected of being in Syria. He said the country was witnessing a wave of recruitment which had not been seen for other conflicts with ties to the Muslim world, such as Afghanistan and Iraq. Most are young Muslims men who have been . radicalised on housing estates around big cities including Paris and . Marseille, but this is the first time that children have been associated . with overseas Jihad, or holy war. Two British men detained at Heathrow on Monday have been charged with travelling to Syria for terrorism (file picture) There is very little the French can do once its nationals actually arrive in Syria, although if and when they return they will be put under police surveillance. Mohammed Merah, a 23-year-old from a Toulouse housing estate, trained with Al Qaeda fighters in Afghanistan before returning to France to shoot dead seven people, including off-duty soldiers, in 2012. Merah was himself killed by police following the atrocities, which led to the French authorities pledging to clamp down on youthful radicalism.","French schoolboys have travelled to the Middle East to fight for Al Qaeda .

"Manchester United's injury woes have continued with news that midfielder Ander Herrera will be out for up to a month with a fractured rib. The Spanish international suffered the injury in the 2-1 defeat of West Ham at Old Trafford last Saturday to joined United's long injury list. United manager Louis van Gaal could have as many as 10 players missing for this Sunday's home game with Everton even though the likes of Phil Jones and Michael Carrick are getting closer to fitness. Ander Herrera is consoled by Juan Mata after being taken off injured in Man United's match with West Ham . Herrera holds his rib as he leaves the Old Trafford pitch following his injury . Herrera has been excellent for United since his summer arrival from Athletic Bilbao . Nine United first-team players are out through injury or suspension. They are: . Ander Herrera, Jonny Evans, Phil Jones, Chris Smalling, Michael Carrick, Marouane Fellaini, Ashley Young, Jesse Lingard and Wayne Rooney. With captain Wayne Rooney suspended, Darren Fletcher could start in the centre of the field while Juan Mata should move off the substitutes' bench. Last night a United statement confirmed: 'Ander sustained a fractured rib during the match against West Ham. (He) was substituted in the 74th minute and the club will continue to monitor his progress over the next few weeks.' Herrera himself tweeted: 'A real shame this injury, but now's not the time to feel sorry for myself. I'm already working to be back as soon as possible!' A fractured rib usually takes up to four weeks to heal, though the recovery period can be as long as six weeks. With an international break looming after this weekend's fixtures in the Barclays Premier League, United hope Herrera will miss just three games – against Everton, West Brom and Chelsea – but the 25-year-old must be a doubt for the Manchester derby on November 2. Herrera has scored twice for United this season, including in the 4-0 victory over QPR at Old Trafford .","Ander Herrera fractured his rib in Man United's 2-1 win over West Ham .

"It's almost eight months to the day since Liverpool and Everton last met and, like bickering siblings, the disagreements go on. Liverpool won 4-0 at Anfield in January, which really should have ended all arguments before they began. This is Merseyside, though, and different rules apply. As such, Everton’s Roberto Martinez has never accepted that result as a hiding while Brendan Rodgers of Liverpool also believes the scoreline wasn’t representative of what went on. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers will urge his players to get on the front foot in the Merseyside derby . Roberto Martinez will not sacrifice his attacking principles against the Reds despite his side leaking goals . Liverpool have lost their last two matches in the Premier League and sit in 11th position after a poor start . Everton have  won only once in the Premier League this season and are just a point above the drop zone . ‘They were fortunate not to go away from the game losing seven or eight,’ said Rodgers rather pithily this week. 222: In 222 derbies, Liverpool have won 89, Everton 66, with 67 draws. 11: The highest-scoring match came in 1933, when Liverpool won 7-4 at Anfield. 13: The number of own goals in this fixture - three by Liverpool and 10 by Everton. 566: The number of Merseyside derby goals - Liverpool with 311 and Everton 255. On the one hand it’s good to know these things still matter that much. It will be a sad day if they ever don’t. On the other hand, however, both clubs go into Saturday’s lunchtime fixture with broader things to ponder, namely rather indifferent starts to the  Premier League season and defensive records more suited to life at the bottom end of the table. It could be argued that the only club from last season’s top end with anything like satisfactory form so far is Chelsea. From that point of view, Liverpool and Everton are not alone. Steven Gerrard scored in Liverpool's 4-0 mauling of Everton when the sides last met, eight months ago . Daniel Sturridge also scored that night, and he is in line to make his return from injury against the Toffees . As well as winning more of the derbies, Liverpool have spent a great deal more than  Everton in recent years . Nevertheless, it is odd to see both teams in the wrong half of the table with just three league wins between them. Everton have conceded 15 goals in five league games. The last time this happened was 20 years ago and manager Mike Walker was not offered the opportunity to stick around and redress the balance. Liverpool conceded three at Manchester City, three at West Ham and have also thrown in a home defeat by Aston Villa. Martinez, at least, was prepared to admit this week that such risks come as a side-effect of the way he sets teams up to play. ‘I’m not going to hide anything,’ said the Everton manager. ‘I know there are managers who are from a school of wanting to win through keeping a clean sheet and having a team that’s difficult to beat with their main goalscoring threat coming from set-pieces. Reds defenders Martin Skrtel (left), Dejan Lovren (centre) and Mamadou Sakho have  looked shaky this season . Martin Keown believes Rodgers needs to rotate his squad better and Everton must focus on their defending . ‘I say this with respect, but I’m from a philosophy of always wanting to win through scoring goals and if that’s going to leave you open, you need to score more goals than the opposition. ‘That’s the top and bottom of it. That’s the only way you can be good enough to win titles and achieve more than people would expect from your team. ‘I feel as hurt losing 1-0 as losing 6-0 but, if you lose 6-3 trying and having a positive from the performance that helps you to take something into the next game, I’ll accept that.’ Contrary to what Martinez believes, it is possible to win titles on the back of clean sheets. Meanwhile, losing 6-3 — as Everton did at home to Chelsea in August — will get you nowhere apart from the opening slot on Match of the Day. With Everton's defence leaking goals, Romelu Lukaku will need to perform if Martinez's side are to get a result . The Spaniard’s approach is clear, though, and we should not begrudge him that. As for Rodgers, he refuses to accept that his own style of play is of the risk-and-reward type, even though Liverpool finished second last season while conceding more goals (50) than Crystal Palace, who finished 11th, and at least as many away (32) as all of the top 17 teams apart from Stoke and Sunderland. This would appear to point to a problem, one perhaps exacerbated so far this season by an uncertain early contribution from summer signing Dejan Lovren. Everton last celebrated a win at Anfield on September 27, 1999 - 15 years ago. Kevin Campbell scored the only goal as red cards were shown to Everton’s Francis Jeffers and Liverpool’s Sander Westerveld and Steven Gerrard. Campbell  said: ‘The thing which surprised me was seeing so many Evertonians celebrating in the Kop!’ Gerrard recalled. ‘I had a gut-wrenching pain in my stomach after that.’ ‘It is probably an easy assumption to make when coaches set up to play an attacking game,’ said Rodgers. ‘The way we set up, it is about having the balance. We look to impose our style on the game, but you always have to respect your opponent.’ All managers defend their teams and their tactics and Rodgers is no different. Looking at the two teams objectively, perhaps Martinez has more to worry about. His defence is pretty much the same as last year. Rodgers, at least, can point to the problems with bedding new players in. Whatever the case, at Anfield  on Saturday the wider arguments don’t matter, only the result. Given the way football often works, this one will probably end up goalless. Kevin Campbell wheels away in delight after scoring the winner in 1999 when Everton last won at Anfield . Gerrard was one of three players sent off in the match where tempers reached boiling point . Everton striker Francis Jeffers and Liverpool goalkeeper Sander Westerveld were also sent off in 1999 .","Liverpool and Everton have both struggled defensively this season .

"There is life after the Barclays Premier League after all. So insular have we become amid the fanfare that surrounds English football that it is easy to forget this. Here at the Etihad Stadium last night, we expected an Ashley Cole sideshow. Back in England for the first time since leaving Chelsea, the best left back of his generation looked unfamiliar in Roma colours. But it was not the 33-year-old defender who caught the eye in an ominously impressive Roma display. Indeed, his was not even the most notable performance by a former Arsenal player. Ashley Cole made his first playing return to English soil since leaving Chelsea over the summer to join Roma . Gervinho was impressive throughout Roma's trip to Manchester City in his attacking role . That honour went to Gervinho, who looks to have become an entirely different footballer since he left the care of Arsene Wenger in the summer of 2013. At the age of 27, the Ivorian striker should be at his peak. What is interesting, though, is that during his difficult two seasons at Arsenal he looked like a player who would probably never have one. His contribution to Arsenal’s Premier League efforts was just nine goals. Throughout his stay, he looked ill-equipped for the English game. Weak, erratic and unreliable, Gervinho came to represent what appeared to be wrong with Wenger’s transfer strategy for strikers. Here on Tuesday night, however, he showed himself to be rather better as Roma provided Manchester City with one of the sternest examinations they have had here in the Champions League — a bold statement given the tough nights Bayern Munich and Barcelona have given the Premier League champions in recent years. Gervinho runs past Manchester City defender Martin Demichelis during the Champions League tie . The former Arsenal player has looked a different prospect since moving to Italy in 2013 to join Roma . Cole tweeted his pleasure at the Roma performance and result but admitted it was strange to be back . Cole certainly contributed. Always a defender who could have made a career as a left-sided midfield player, he remains technically proficient and bright. Towards the end of the first half he was a toe-end away from what would have been a memorable goal as he arrived a fraction too late to meet a low cross. Gervinho was more prominent and that was largely because Roma saw so much of the ball for the first hour. Despite City beginning the evening with a goal, Roma terrified them at times and Gervinho’s searing pace was at the heart of the threat. Manuel Pellegrini and his team should not have been surprised. It is only two weeks since Roma scored five in Moscow, with Gervinho contributing two of them. ‘Wow,’ was City goalkeeper Joe Hart’s response when told of that scoreline following defeat in Munich on the same night. Now Cole’s great friend has experienced first-hand what the Serie A team are capable of when they have possession. The Ivory Coast striker scored nine Premier League goals during his three years at Arsenal . But Gervinho was better known for a string of unfortunate misses and rarely played up front for Arsenal . Hart could no nothing when former City player Maicon struck the underside of his bar early on and was similarly helpless when a rapier Roma thrust provided Francesco Totti with the equaliser not long after. Gervinho brought a super save from the City keeper after turning on the burners to flash past Gael Clichy and Martin Demichelis just before half-time and it was the pace of the Italians — both with the ball and in the mind — that was the cause of the home team’s troubles throughout. City can be devastating when they have the ball. In the Premier League, they break as quickly as any team. There are times, though, when Pellegrini’s midfield can look ponderous and flat-footed if they don’t have control of the game — and so it was on Tuesday night. The striker celebrates with Francesco Totti after the vetera Italian had scored Roma's equaliser . Cole stops Jesus Navas with help from Gervinho. Both former Arsenal players impressed on Tuesday night . Sergio Aguero puts Manchester City ahead from the penalty spot in the fourth minute at the Etihad Stadium . With Yaya Toure having one of ‘those’ nights — when he looks more omnibus than blunderbuss — City struggled to hold Roma at bay. At times in the first hour it was reminiscent of Chelsea’s domination of City here last February and on European nights at home it has to be better than this. This is only the group stage, after all. As the game wore on, City did find a little more of their true selves. Gervinho’s influence waned and Cole was asked to spend substantially more time in his own half. City were the better team for the last 20 minutes. There was enough here, though, to concern Pellegrini. Cole, Gervinho and Co await in Rome for the final group game in December and, on this evidence, City would not wish to go there needing too much. Aguero celebrates giving City the perfect start after their defeat to Bayern Munich on the opening match-day .

"The true cost of trying to lure Cristiano Ronaldo back to the Premier League can be revealed to be more than £140million after it emerged that the former Manchester United star’s advisors have been asking for astonishing wages of £20m a year. Ronaldo is understood to be willing to listen to offers after becoming unsettled at Real Madrid and new United manager Louis van Gaal did not rule out a move for the World Player of the Year last weekend. Cristiano Ronaldo scored another hat-trick for Real Madrid this week to take his goal tally to 264 . However, any club wishing to buy Ronaldo would have to come up with mind-boggling sums after it emerged that the player’s representatives set the bar at £385,000 a week when they put feelers out regarding their client 18 months ago. At that time United were interested in a move for their former golden child as the club’s owners the Glazer family looked to add the ultimate signing to the squad David Moyes had inherited from Sir Alex Ferguson. Ronaldo was hawked around Europe’s top clubs that summer before eventually signing a new five-year deal at the Bernabeu. Ronaldo was hawked around Europe’s top clubs that summer before eventually signing a new five-year deal . Ronaldo is understood to be willing to listen to offers after becoming unsettled at Real Madrid . ‘It simply wasn’t worth having the conversation at those numbers,’ said one top Premier League source on Thursday night. Despite Ronaldo’s success at Real — he now has 264 goals for them — he is expected to look to leave once again next summer. Sources in Spain point to Ronaldo not feeling loved and indicate he may be president Florentino Perez’s one high-profile departure of 2015. Manchester United were interested in signing Ronaldo last summer but he opted to stay in Spain . A group of United fans plan to fly a 'come home Ronaldo' banner over Real Madrid's next game . VIDEO Ronaldo return to United could cost 140m . By then Ronaldo will be past his 30th birthday and there are serious questions as to whether United — or anyone in England — could find the money to sign him, even if his wage demands were to drop slightly. With Perez sure to want around £60m for someone who continues to produce world-class displays, even a four-year deal for Ronaldo would take the total investment to over £140m — for a player heading towards his 35th birthday by the time that contract ran out. Last month United did decide to go the extra mile to sign another Real Madrid player, Angel di Maria, in a transfer worth more than £120m. Ronaldo could be reunited with Wayne Rooney if he decides to return to Old Trafford . They also agreed to pay loanee striker Falcao £265,000 a week between now and the end of the season. However, a move for Ronaldo would blow those salaries out of the water and cause potential problems. Another Premier League executive said: ‘Even when you have a dressing room full of well-paid players, you are always taking a risk when you introduce a player who earns so much more than the rest.’ Like our Manchester United Facebook page.

"New York City FC will oppose any move from Manchester City to keep Frank Lampard at the Etihad Stadium for longer than his agreed loan spell. Lampard has been a hit at City since his loan from their sister club in the MLS started recently, scoring once against Chelsea and twice in the Capital One Cup rout of Sheffield Wednesday. The 36-year-old’s impressive form has prompted suggestions that he may prove useful to City boss Manuel Pellegrini beyond the length of his current loan spell that is due to end in January. Frank Lampard is scheduled to return to parent club New York City FC from Manchester City in January . City boss Manuel Pellegrini has been impressed with Lampard and hopes he stays at the Etihad for longer . The midfielder scored against his old club Chelsea on Sunday, and has found his stride at  City . Lampard also scored twice in the 7-0 Capital One cup win against Sheffield Wednesday at the Etihad . Pellegrini has not ruled out the possibility of Lampard staying but sources in America stressed on Thursday that New York City FC expect their marquee signing to be in the States for pre-season training in the new year after building a marketing strategy around him and selling tickets due to his transfer. While there is no suggestion that City and the MLS franchise it established last year are pulling in opposite directions, it would appear that City fans will have to make do with just five months of the former England star. Asked about the Lampard stories on Tuesday this week, NYCFC coach Jason Kreis said: ‘There is no truth in this rumour at all.’ Frank Lampard poses for a selfie with a fan during  City's Capital One cup clash with Sheffield Wednesday . The MLS season doesn’t start until March and there is an argument that Lampard won’t need a pre-season if he has been playing with City. However, it is understood that officials in New York see Lampard as their big sell this season — even more so than fellow summer signing David Villa — and want him available for their training camp and a series of warm-up games. Lampard steered clear of the issue on Thursday, saying he would let the two clubs make the decision. ‘I’m contracted here until the start of January and that is how it is at the moment,’ he said. ‘More than that, I don’t know. The argument (about me staying) has only come up since I scored at the weekend. The important thing for me is to train well, play well and then see what happens. ‘I signed on here until January so that is all I can say. When I signed for Man City on loan, six weeks or so ago, it was always until January and that is the way it remains so I wouldn’t want to get too far ahead of myself. The former England star signed for New York City FC in July but went on loan to City almost immediately . ‘It is not my place to do that. It would be a club decision, first and foremost. I will train and play as well as I can and the rest is up to the club.’ Lampard enjoyed a memorable night on Wednesday and found himself in an embrace with a young fan who ran on to the field five minutes from the end to take a ‘selfie’ with his favourite player. The 15-year-old was released on bail by Greater Manchester Police until October 19 after being arrested on suspicion of encroachment of the pitch. He is expected to be banned for three games by City. Lampard had been at Chelsea for 13 years prior to joining City and it has clearly been a challenge to adjust to a new environment. ‘Yes, it’s been very different,’ he admitted. ‘I was at Chelsea such a long time you just go along on auto-pilot in the end. You know how it is, you drive in every day, you know everybody behind the scenes. The 36-year-old was hugely emotional after scoring against his old club Chelsea on Sunday . ‘It was a tester for me to come here. I didn’t have to make this decision but it was a very good opportunity for me to train and play at this level which arose. ‘And it is a personal test to come up to Manchester and be up here for this six months, or five months, whatever it is. I was very much in a comfort zone at Chelsea. I worked at Chelsea for 13 years, trained there, played there and now it is different. It is good to test yourself in life and all I can say is that I am enjoying it. ‘I’m very fortunate. Not many players at the age of 36 get the opportunity to come and play among these players. When you look around the dressing room there is so much quality and that is a real honour for me to come and play amongst that.’ VIDEO Lampard City deal extended .","New York City FC say that Frank Lampard will return to them in January .

"Bayern Munich star Arjen Robben has backed his former manager Louis van Gaal to turn Manchester United into a European force. Robben, who was on Van Gaal’s list of summer transfer targets, has no doubt his Bayern and Holland boss will do the restructuring job that is required at United. ‘I was very happy for him that he won the game against QPR last weekend,’ said Robben.

"Louis van Gaal has challenged Roy Hodgson after the England manager suggested Manchester United’s teenage left-back Luke Shaw has always had problems with his fitness. Shaw, 19, is one of 10 crocked United players missing Saturday’s Barclays Premier League game at Burnley after injuring his hamstring in pre-season.

Having words: Louis van Gaal put Shaw on a special fitness regime during pre-season .

On Friday night, Van Gaal said: ‘I want to say something about Shaw. I read nasty articles about him when we were in the USA. 'I said to him he needed to train and I changed his programme and he did everything he had to do to be fit. He is training fantastic. 'He is not fit now because he is injured but Roy Hodgson cannot judge at this moment. He can’t judge him because I have never seen him at one of our training sessions.

"Although he seemed to have forgotten all about it on Friday, Louis van Gaal has been here before. It was in May 1992 that the Dutchman took his young Ajax team to Turf Moor for a post-season friendly to mark Burnley’s success in winning the English Fourth Division. For the Lancastrians it was an afternoon of celebration. For Van Gaal, though, it was just another step on the way to building his great Ajax team. The Amsterdam club had just won the UEFA Cup - Van Gaal’s first trophy at the club - but it was to be another two years before he guided them to the Dutch championship and three before they lifted the European Cup. VIDEO Scroll down Louis van Gaal: I have given every player a fair chance . Bold prediction: Louis van Gaal (right) believes Manchester United can lift the Premier League title this season . All smiles: Winger Angel di Maria (centre) will make his United debut against Burnley at Turf Moor on Saturday . Primed and ready: Manchester United train on Friday ahead of Saturday's lunch-time clash with Burnley . As Van Gaal likes to say so much, it was the start of a process and the similarities with his current situation at Manchester United are quite clear. Van Gaal had to be prompted to remember the game but then said: ‘It’s a long time ago but yes, I know about that game as I was there. We won. I remember that. More importantly, though, it was also a step in the process for me with Ajax. ‘That is what I talk about here. We won the UEFA Cup in the first year but had to wait for other things. Then we won the domestic cup, another step in the process. ‘This game at Burnley will be difficult for us. It’s not a big stadium or a big pitch so it will be a fantastic atmosphere and I believe the supporters shall stimulate the players of Burnley. ‘It’s also a derby, they will play with a lot of passion, a lot of long balls. You have to fight against it. ‘It will be a very difficult game but we have to show we can play football, that we can pass the ball in spite of the pressure of Burnley.’ Skills: Angel Di Maria will showcase his talent during his Manchester United debut against Burnley on Saturday . Van Gaal was in bullish mood despite the fact that his squad will arrive at Turf Moor on Saturday missing 10 players through injury and new defender Marcos Rojo because of work permit issues. The Dutch coach’s message remains the same. If he is given time and shown patience then he will bring success to United. On Friday he even challenged the media to get behind him. ‘We can be the champions still in England now, in my first year,’ said Van Gaal. ‘Maybe you shall laugh, but also in my former clubs I have started like this, so for me it’s not big news or different, because I have already said that. ‘But you have to survive as a trainer-coach, as a manager. You have to survive, because, nowadays, the fans are asking for results and this is the question: Can I receive enough time to do all the steps we have to do? Talking tactics: Louis van Gaal gives some advice to his players during a training session on Friday . Opposition: Van Gaal and Manchester United will face Sean Dyche (pictured) and his Burnley side on Saturday . ‘Maybe you (the media) can support Louis van Gaal. Do you believe in him? Yes? OK. What a fantastic end, a fantastic end.’ There is, of course, no reason for Van Gaal to feel under undue pressure. Much has conspired against him since the season started. Nevertheless, he does need a result on Saturday after taking only a point from Premier League games against Swansea and Sunderland and losing 4-0 in the Capital One Cup to MK Dons. New signing Angel di Maria will go straight into United’s team against Burnley and may find himself alongside players such as Danny Welbeck and Tom Cleverley, even though both know they are not wanted by the new manager. Laughter: Robin van Persie enjoys a joke during training ahead of Manchester United's trip to Burnley . Surplus: The unwanted dup of Danny Welbeck (pictured) and Tom Cleverley could feature against Burnley . Asked about this, Van Gaal said: ‘I am not a short-term coach. I am thinking always for the long-term. You have to take measures that are not good for the short term but better for the long term of the club. ‘That may not be good for me as a coach. But I am not here for me myself as a coach. I am here for the club.’ Details of Ajax’s game with Burnley 22 years ago are so hard to come by that only a Burnley fans’ website threw up the attendance (a little more than 10,000) and the scoreline (1-0 to Ajax) while it is unlikely that Van Gaal himself will remember much about the goalscorer that day, one Ignacio Tuhnretus.

Return: Van Gaal (right) and his young Ajax team visited Turf Moor in a pre-season friendly in 1992 .

That’s why. Not because of other things. ‘I don’t believe my philosophy won’t work at Manchester United. I believe that at the end of the process I think everybody will be happy that I was here.

"At the end of a contest that produced the expected result, there was an unexpected moment, a hug between Manuel Pellegrini and Jose Mourinho. If the two men have decided to get along after a few years of discord then its perhaps as well. They will be seeing quite a bit of each other over the coming years. Before this season started, most people had Manchester City and Chelsea as the two teams most likely to win the Barclays Premier League. Perhaps we should go further now. After only a month of the new season, they look the only teams capable of winning it. Rival managers Manuel Pellegrini and Jose Mourinho embrace after the 1-1 draw at the Etihad on Sunday . Speaking on TV at full-time yesterday, former Liverpool midfielder Graeme Souness said eloquently: ‘These two are head and shoulders above everybody else. They don’t have weaknesses.’ On a weekend that saw Liverpool fail at West Ham and Manchester United embarrass themselves at Leicester, this was proper football. There was resilience, organisation and devastating quality. There were goals from substitutes and contributions from players operating in unfamiliar positions. There was an absence of panic from Manchester City when they fell a man, and then a goal, behind. Equally there was no complacency from Chelsea when they won a lead the general pattern of play had not pointed to. The Manchester United bench is stunned after falling to a catastrophic 5-3 defeat to Leicester City from 3-1 up . Liverpool manager instructs captain Steven Gerrard during their lacklustre 3-1 defeat to West Ham . Had Diego Costa not struck a post with the score at 1-0, they would have had a win of significance. Referee Mike Dean almost ruined the afternoon. Not by sending off Pablo Zabaleta for a second booking, but by distributing so many yellow cards in the first half that a red one always seemed possible, if not inevitable, later on. A victory for Chelsea would have felt just a little hollow. Until the sending off, they had been marginally second best in a contest that was notable at that point for some expert defending by both teams. Pellegrini attempts to reason with Mourinho during the enthralling match between their sides at the Etihad . Eliaquim Mangala, on debut for Manchester City, was magnificent alongside Vincent Kompany in defence . Despite the late drama, the pairings of Vincent Kompany and Eliaquim Mangala and John Terry and Gary Cahill were the stand-out features of this game. Partnerships like those win titles, despite the millions of pounds invested in players at the other end of the field. Happily, City were able to regain parity. Happily because it left us talking about a fair result and a remarkable Frank Lampard story rather than the referee’s influence. City’s equaliser was interesting and told us much about their qualities. James Milner had performed terrifically down the right side, providing evidence that English players can thrive at City if they are good enough. But it was from the position of left back that he advanced to provide Lampard with the opportunity to equalise. Running on to David Silva’s chipped pass, Milner was on the stretch but the touch he applied to the ball was perfect in weight and in direction. Andre Schurrle celebrates scoring Chelsea's opener but rarely starts due to competition for places in the side . Substitutes are increasingly important in the Premier League, especially to those clubs with Champions League commitments. Squads win championships, as they say. Andre Schurrle is a good one, too. The German showed this during the World Cup in Brazil. Here, he timed his far post run perfectly in the 71st minute, allowing him to make the most of a superb Eden Hazard cross that was enabled in the first place by a superb turn and pass from Costa. This is what makes these teams so impressive, so effective. Costa, for example, had endured a difficult afternoon. In trying to impose himself physically on City captain Kompany, he had failed. Lampard arrives late in the box to score City's equaliser and deny Chelsea three points at the Etihad . In essence, he had lost one of the pivotal personal duals of the game. Still, though, he was able to influence the outcome. Both clubs have benefited from long-term planning and transfer strategy. As United are finding, big money deals pushed through at the last minute will only take you so far. Mangala was immense on his debut on Sunday, only slightly less effective than Kompany. Costa also emerged to play his part, too. Chelsea and City were fine teams last season but they have improved and whether anyone else can really get near them is very doubtful. In the press conference room, Pellegrini and Mourinho reverted to type and started criticising each other. Maybe that hug meant nothing at all. Maybe it pointed at relief and satisfaction in equal measure. Lampard shakes hand with his former Chelsea team mate John Terry at the final whistle at the Etihad . Mourinho ad Pellegrini shake hands but they were far from complimentary in the post match interviews .","Rivals Manchester City and Chelsea drew 1-1 in pulsating match on Sunday .

"Louis van Gaal isn’t the type of man to look backwards when looking forwards is available. To find the early reasons why his immediate future is log jammed with problems, though, we do need to look over our shoulders, back to a time when Manchester United were winning trophies and widening cracks were being covered by shiny silver and gold paper. That was when today’s troubles really started at Old Trafford, back in the glorious days of Sir Alex Ferguson. It sounds ungrateful to say it; impertinent, rude and sacrilegious. But it’s true, nevertheless. United continued to win trophies during Ferguson’s latter years at United but the future, it transpires, was not adequately being taken care of. This is the future that Van Gaal has inherited and one reason why the current United manager has arrived at Old Trafford to find a squad so desperately short of quality. Frustrated figure: Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal watches his side lose 4-0 to MK Dons . Game over: MK Dons striker Benik Afobe scores his side's fourth goal of the night to shock United . Final triumph: Sir Alex Ferguson holds the 2012-13 Premier League trophy shortly before retiring . Tuesday night’s embarrassing defeat at Milton Keynes cannot be blamed on one individual. It contained dreadful playing errors. Nevertheless, it is impossible to view the current picture of United’s predicament without placing their greatest ever manager somewhere in it as the recruitment statistics of Ferguson’s last six years in charge make for startling viewing. During that time, United won four Barclays Premier League titles, two League Cups and a Champions League as a core of previously and expertly recruited players – Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic, Patrice Evra, Park Ji-sung, Michael Carrick, Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney - combined seamlessly with the last vestiges of the Class of ’92 to ensure Ferguson’s remarkable team remained eminent. Inspired signing: Cristiano Ronaldo gave United years of fine performances before leaving for £80million . Captaincy material: Wayne Rooney (left) ranks among Ferguson's best acquisitions during his time at United . Nani (£17m) Anderson (£27m) Ashley Young (£17m) Bebe (£7.4m) Owen Hargreaves (£17m) Tomasz Kuszczak (£2m) Zoran Tosic (£7m) Dimitar Berbatov (£30m) Gabriel Obertan (£3m) Mame Biram Diouf (£3m) Javier Hernandez (£6m) Chris Smalling (£7m) Nick Powell (£6m) Alexander Buttner (£4m) Wilfried Zaha (£15m) During those last six years, however, Ferguson, despite the restrictions of Glazer ownership, invested in the region of £160m of the club’s money on a string of players he believed would form the club’s future. Some have certainly contributed during better times but none have ultimately endured and this, in hindsight, represents the beginning of a decline exacerbated by David Moyes’ erratic season last time round. Between the summer of 2007 and the January of 2013, Ferguson’s United bought Nani (£17m), Anderson (£27m), Ashley Young (£17m), Bebe (£7m), Owen Hargreaves (£17m), Tomasz Kuszczak (£2m), Zoran Tosic (£7m), Dimitar Berbatov (£30m), Gabriel Obertan (£3m), Mame Biram Diouf (£3m), Javier Hernandez (£6m), Chris Smalling (£7m), Nick Powell (£6m), Alexander Buttner (£4m) and Wilfried Zaha (£15m). Set against those purchases is the arrival of the more successful Rafael da Silva, Antonio Valencia, Phil Jones, David de Gea and, of course, Robin van Persie. Exit door: United hope to offload midfielder Anderson (left) and sent Nani (right) on loan to Sporting Lisbon . Unveiling: Bulgarian Dimitar Berbatov poses with his shirt after signing for Manchester United in 2008 . Big money buy: Winger Wilfried Zaha was brought in from Crystal Palace for a fee of £15m . To question Ferguson’s legacy in this way is a very uncomfortable thing to do. It is more fashionable, more palatable, to blame Moyes entirely. Nevertheless it is equally difficult to examine the two lists of players above and ignore the very obvious connection between then and now. Ferguson’s incredible man management skills endured to the end but his judgement in the transfer market seemingly did not. During his latter years, United were winning. In reality, though, they were also hanging on as the world changed around them. Paul Scholes retired once and was lured back, eventually quitting for good at the age of 37. Ryan Giggs played until he was 40. There were reasons for this. Anybody who saw United play regularly during that time will have recognised the marginal regression in their football that was not always hidden beneath generally positive results. Back then, Manchester City and Chelsea were coming on strong and players like Van Persie and De Gea were never going to hold back the tide on their own. The old ones are the best: Ryan Giggs played until he was 40 - Paul Scholes quit at 37 after a second spell . Farewell: Ferguson waves to the fans after his final match in charge of United at West Brom in 2013 . Senior sources at Old Trafford have admitted that the 2013 title, Ferguson’s last, surprised them. They didn’t expect it. They had seen the quality of the squad wane. A poor summer in the market after Moyes’ appointment didn’t help and had Van Gaal’s predecessor inspired his players a little more maybe United would have squeezed another year out of Vidic and Evra. Regardless of that, Van Gaal’s first challenge now is to arrest this decline and then find first gear. Certainly, what he has found will have alarmed him. The Dutch coach has inherited, for example, a Premier League squad without a fully functioning defensive line and he must ask himself how a club of United’s standing and stature has allowed that to happen. This is why he suggested after Tuesday’s failure at MK Dons that results this season haven’t surprised him. Van Gaal does do a neat line in sarcasm but this wasn’t one of them. Get him in the engine room: Angel di Maria should be available against Burnley on Saturday . VIDEO Di Maria joins La Liga's England exodus . Looking ahead to Saturday’s Premier League game at Burnley, Van Gaal’s most pressing concern will be his system and how to fit record signing Angel di Maria in to it. Just as Juan Mata struggled to fit in to Moyes’ team last January, so Di Maria does not look a natural fit for the 3-4-1-3 formation that Van Gaal has placed so much faith in thus far. Van Gaal hinted after Tuesday’s game that he may change his tactics and indeed he may have to. The 62-year-old has attempted to engrain the system in all levels of football at United’s Carrington training ground and clearly saw a long-term future in the formation he used to great effect with Holland at the World Cup. Tough times: Van Gaal (centre rear) looks on as United are knocked out by MK Dons in the Capital One Cup . Already, though, it is looking shot to pieces. United’s defenders do not look comfortable with it and Di Maria arrives as a player seemingly ready-made to slip in to 4-3-3. Van Gaal will surely be a big enough man to perform a volte face if he needs to but any move away from his current formation would leave him with a problem connected not with dented pride but where to play his captain Rooney and indeed the aforementioned Mata. Sketch a United starting XI on to paper and it will look competitive enough. Injuries are currently hurting them to the extent that they appear worse than they actually are. Van Gaal is not fooled, though. There are fissions in this squad that will not be solved in one transfer window. The cumulative effect of six years of questionable judgement now weighs heavy.","Louis van Gaal has arrived at Old Trafford to find a squad desperately short of quality .
The recruitment statistics of Ferguson's last six years in charge make for startling viewing .

"And so it was true, after all. When Manchester United chief executive Ed Woodward conceded, under questioning from reporters in Los Angeles this summer, that the ailing Premier League club were prepared to eclipse the British transfer record this summer, he meant it. This week’s imminent acquisition of Angel di Maria will cost the club in the region of £60million, and more than £100m when £200,000-a-week wages over five years are added to the bill. As a statement of intent by United, Woodward and new manager Louis van Gaal, it’s significant. Di Maria is a top player approaching his peak years and in persuading him to leave Real Madrid for a club with no Champions League football on offer, United and their much-criticised chief executive will feel they are pulling off a proper transfer. Big statement: United are signing one of Real Madrid's best players and  last season's Champions League hero . Creative: The winger should bring a new spark to Louis Van Gaal's side, which has been lacking this season . Whether Di Maria is what this United squad really needs remains to be seen. Nevertheless, the financial details of the transfer serve to indicate that, for once, United have been prepared to put their money where their mouth is and back their manager. A heavily incentivised package that will net the 26-year-old just over £10m-a-year, it eclipses the money offered to him by mega-rich PSG and indeed the £6.3m-a-year after tax that his representatives told Manchester City they would take when they tried, without success, to draw them into bidding recently. At United, the deal will put Di Maria second in the financial pecking order, behind Wayne Rooney and just ahead of Robin van Persie. Perhaps that’s right, given that Rooney is captain and Van Persie — for all his talents — is 31 and, unfortunately, rather injury-prone. On the look out: Di Maria peers out of his United car as he arrives for the completion of his transfer . Spotted: Di Maria is on the left hand side of the back seat on his way into United's training ground . Van Gaal and Woodward must now only hope that this transfer works for both of them. Certainly, Di Maria is a fine player. The rangy, free-striding forward was looked at by both Manchester clubs and Chelsea during his earlier years at Benfica. Then, he was considered a little physically immature, not a good fit for the Premier League. In Spain, however, Di Maria has trained on. He was terrific last season and during the recent World Cup in Brazil he looked a thoroughbred, playing a significant part in Argentina’s path towards a final he was to miss through injury. At United the question focuses on where he will fit into the Dutch boss’ 3-4-1-2 formation. It is difficult to see him as a wing back — he hasn’t played there before — which leads to the thought that he may be used as one of Van Gaal’s centre forwards. Maybe this is why Danny Welbeck has been told to find a new club. Still number one: New United captain Wayne Rooney is the only man at the club to earn more than Di Maria . Stifled: There may be a worry that Adnan Januzaj's development may be blocked by the arrival of Di Maria . When the deal goes through, United will have spent around £100m on Di Maria and Juan Mata, who they took from Chelsea in January. Many would argue that money would have been better thrown at a world-class holding midfield player. That, above all, is what this fragile United team appears to need. It may also be the case that his arrival could block the development of young Adnan Januzaj. Nevertheless, United are close to delivering the stellar player fans have demanded since last season’s disappointing campaign. His first engagement is likely to be at Burnley’s Turf Moor on Saturday lunchtime. We will all look forward to that.

"Remarkable moments often win big matches but Leeds Rhinos winger Ryan Hall claims he will never remember his. Hall is one of rugby league’s most incredible athletes. Built like a prop forward, the England international possesses a dexterity that belies his enormous frame. Sometimes, though, it’s brute strength and force of will that get you through and that is how it was on Saturday at Wembley as two bulldozing tries — both from standing starts — enabled Leeds to end a run of six Challenge Cup final defeats by beating Castleford in the sport’s showpiece. Match-winner: Ryan Hall scores his second try in a man of the match-winning Challenge Cup performance . Champions: McGuire holds the Challenge Cup aloft after the Rhinos' win on Saturday . ‘Out there you don’t think about individual things, you just want to do what is best for the team,’ said Hall. ‘I can’t remember the second try. I will have to watch it on video to realise what really happened. ‘At the time you do it and then you are, like: “What’s going on? How have I done that?”,’ Hall, 26, is one of the brightest players in Super League. He knows, therefore, that when coach Brian McDermott calls him a ‘freak’ it’s a compliment. Clincher: Leeds captain Kevin Sinfield (centre) celebrates a late drop goal in their 23-10 knockout final win . One of the best: Hall, dubbed among the world's finest wingers say his team-mates, described scoring tries at Wembley as 'magical' ‘He has called me that before,’ he smiled. ‘Everyone has attributes and these are mine. I play the hand I have been dealt. I am a robust guy and I make the most of it.’ Hall pipped team-mate Danny McGuire to the Lance Todd Man of the Match trophy. While Hall honoured his media commitments, McGuire lay in hospital with three busted ribs. Castleford were not at their best on their big day and coach Daryl Powell will always regret that. ‘We got rattled and I don’t know why,’ he admitted. Leeds led early through Tom Briscoe and were never caught. A try from second row Oliver Holmes brought Castleford to within six points early in the second period but Hall left three opponents on the floor to stretch Leeds’ advantage again in the 67th minute and a McGuire drop goal finished things off. Rhinos forward Jamie Jones- Buchanan said: ‘Sometimes it’s good to have no common sense. Ryan hasn’t got any. 'He just steamrolls everybody and puts that ball down. He is phenomenal. He’s a world-class athlete.’ Man of steel: Danny McGuire ignored broken ribs to score a superb solo try in the win over Castleford .","Hall scores twice as Leeds win Challenge Cup final .

"On June 24 in Natal, Luis Suarez contributed the single most memorable act of this summer’s World Cup when he bit Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini. It set off a chain of events that ultimately saw the Uruguayan sold to Barcelona . By coincidence, also playing that day was the man who has now transpired to be Suarez’s unlikely replacement at Liverpool and it is the evidence of that hot afternoon in north-east Brazil that, as much as anything, goes to show just how big a gamble Brendan Rodgers is taking in bringing Mario Balotelli back to the Barclays Premier League. VIDEO Scroll down to watch the biggest, badest and best moments of Mario Balotelli . Anfield bound: Liverpool think flamboyant Italian striker Mario Balotelli is good value at £16million . World Cup drama: Former Liverpool striker Luis Suarez bit Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini . Super Mario: Balotelli left the Premier League in 2013, but now seems to be on his way back with Liverpool . How it's going to be: Balotelli mocked up in a Liverpool shirt in anticipation of his move to Anfield . Drive to succeed: Balotelli leaves Milan's training ground in his red Ferrari . Change of heart: Rodgers had previously said he would not be signing the Italian striker . Stats: Balotelli's Premier League record (via Opta) In arguably the biggest game of his year, Balotelli was dreadful against Uruguay in a contest that was to decide Italy’s destiny. Fouled early on, he contributed almost nothing, was booked for dissent and substituted at half-time. In some ways, Balotelli’s World Cup mirrored his career. He scored against England in the first game to briefly threaten a genuine impact. Two totally ineffective games later, he was heading home. This is what should perhaps give Liverpool supporters pause for thought today. Balotelli’s colourful private life may well be manageable by someone like Rodgers. What is open to question, though, is whether the 24-year-old has improved enough as a footballer since he left Manchester City one-and-a-half years ago to merit an investment of £16millon plus wages. On the surface the evidence would appear not. Balotelli was a million miles away from being a Premier League footballer during his time at City. Even Roberto Mancini’s own coaching staff felt that. A dreadful trainer with an inability — or unwillingness — to listen and to process information, he could rarely be relied upon in game situations largely because of his tendency to disregard instructions and therefore disrupt team shape and tactics. On the training pitch, Balotelli used to antagonise team-mates when he grew restless and feign injury whenever he made a mistake. It was not a particularly effective combination. On the field, he provided occasional moments of inspiration but they were relatively rare. Striker: Balotelli scored 30 goals in 80 games for City before moving back to Italy . Flashpoint: Balotelli had a number of run-ins during his explosive relationship with Roberto Mancini . Difficult footballers — Suarez, for example — are often worth the trouble if they contribute on the field. If they don’t then they just become an expensive waste of time. Having returned to Italy, Balotelli scored 14 Serie A goals last season, a decent return in that competition. It is tempting to wonder, though, why Milan have been so keen to sell him back to an English club, even if international team-mate Andrea Pirlo does think he is a much-changed individual. ‘Mario has matured since he has been back in Italy,’ said Pirlo. ‘He will be the first to admit when he was younger he made some mistakes — but he is not that player anymore.’ Rodgers has already improved a good number of players at Anfield. Suarez was a better player when he left, Daniel Sturridge — who he had huge reservations over — has trained on while Raheem Sterling is a far better player and person after two years working with Rodgers. The Northern Irishman clearly has flair for this part of the job and maybe he can prove the sceptics wrong. If he does, it will be some achievement. Balotelli will need love and attention and, just as importantly, will expect to play every week as a through-the-middle No 9. He is not a flexible footballer.

"Barcelona are facing a struggle with Louis van Gaal and Manchester United for Thomas Vermaelen and Juan Cuadrado, according to Spanish daily Sport. They picture the Dutchman on their front page and suggest he could be about to 'torpedo' the Catalan side for both the Arsenal defender and the Fiorentina winger. Colombian Cuadrado, 26, is on the verge of joining United for a fee of £36m, the paper reports. Bidding war: Barcelona and Manchester United are going head-to-head for the signatures of Fiorentina winger Juan Cuadrado and Arsenal centre-back Thomas Vermaelen, according to Sport. Barcelona are confident of tying up a deal for Vermaelen over the weekend . And they say Vermaelen, 28, is the subject of a sizeable bid from United which Arsenal may find hard to refuse, even though they would prefer he joined Barca. However, it does appear Vermaelen will join Barca this weekend after Arsenal were unable to agree a swap deal with United involving Chris Smalling going the other way. Elsewhere in the Spanish press, Marca are licking their lips at the prospect of Real Madrid in the season to come. 'A Madird made up of cannons,' is their front page headline as they predict plenty of goals from outside the box. Summer acquisitions James Rodriguez and Toni Kroos join long-range specialists Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale in the side, meaning the Bernabeu faithful can expect plenty of spectacular goals. Cannons: Marca say the addition of James Rodriguez and Toni Kroos to the Real Madrid line-up means fans will see more spectacular goals from outside the box this season than ever before . They add that Madrid were already the team that scored the most goals from outside the box last season. One superstar that won't be moving to Madrid is Radamel Falcao, they report, with the vice-President of his club Monaco saying: 'We have spoken with Madrid many times this ummer and they have never asked about Falcao.' And another player potentially staying put is Angel Di Maria, according to AS, after his move to Paris Saint-Germain 'hit the brakes.' The PSG owner Nasser Al-Khelaifi is quoted as saying: 'We have stopped negotiations because it's too expensive.' The French champions were expected to complete a deal worth in excess of £50m for the Argentine winger, who also interested Man United, but that now appears to be off. It's off: Angel Di Maria's prospective move to Paris Saint-Germain looks to have hit the buffers after Nasser Al-Khalifi said he was 'too expensive' Atletico Madrid, meanwhile, are going to make another bid for Torino striker Alessio Cerci, with the Italian club resigned to losing him. Catalan paper Mundo Deportivo predict a reduction in Luis Suarez's four-month ban from 'all football-related activity' following his World Cup bite on Giorgio Chiellini. Barcelona's new £75m striker is due at the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne on Friday for an appeal hearing. The club expect the ban to be cut back to the end of August and to be able to officially present him as a Barcelona player in the next week or two.

He told Sky Sports: 'What I really like about Rooney is his attitude towards playing for United. 'Wherever the manager tells him to play he will do that with a smile on his face.

"Roberto Martinez is determined rising star Ross Barkley won't have his head turned by the trappings of fame and fortune. The 20-year-old has been exceptional for Everton over the past year and his manager has pledged to keep him on the straight and narrow for the good of club and country. Barkley rounded off his breakthrough campaign with a call up into Roy Hodgson's England squad for the World Cup in Brazil and the midfielder, who has just signed a four-year contract, is set to have an even bigger impact in the season to come. 'Complete player': Roberto Martinez has praised Ross Barkley after the 20-year-old agreed a four-year contract at Everton this week and has promised to keep him on the right path . Excellent: Barkley celebrates his goal against Manchester City at Goodison Park last season . In a summer when Jack Wilshere was caught smoking at a Las Vegas pool party and Ravel Morrison was charged with assault, Martinez says the next great English hope will not be led astray. He told the Sunday Mirror: 'It is a problem we have in the modern game and society in general, so it is really important to make sure that we are there for him and and, when he needs support and guidance, we must commit ourselves to do that. 'He lives at home with his mum at the moment, but he has a good balance in his life. He loves playing football and being at home too. 'His lifestyle is pristine, he lives for the game and his family and wants to learn. Call up: Barkley's reward for his fine season with Everton was a place in the England World Cup squad . Statement of intent: Everton have spent £28m on Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku, who had a brilliant season on loan at the club last year . 'He is a young man, but he does everything in moderation, with the real focus of knowing that the next day he will be on the football pitch training. 'He has an incredible balance to his life, but I am sure he will be tested in the next few years and we have to make sure we are all around him to help whenever that is needed. 'But I have never seen a young man with things so clear in his mind, so humble and someone who won't have his heads turned by fame.' Martinez describes Barkley as the 'complete footballer' and admits that he is building his team around him next season as Everton pursue qualification for the Champions League.

"Laurent Koscielny was sent home from the France squad with an achilles problem in a fresh injury scare for Arsene Wenger . Arsenal are the most injury-prone club in the Premier League – with Mesut Ozil's knee ligament damage the 890th separate injury they have had since 2002. In research that won't surprise long-suffering Gunners fans, specialist website premierinjuries.com have gone through every pulled muscle and broken leg over the past dozen years and revealed that Arsene Wenger's men have suffered an injury nearly every five days and 100 more different knocks than their closest 'challengers', Manchester United. Ozil, a World Cup winner with Germany, has been ruled out for up to 12 weeks with a partial knee ligament tear sustained in Sunday's 2-0 defeat against Chelsea. VIDEO Scroll down to look back at Walcott and Ramsey's recoveries from injuries . Mesut Ozil's knee ligament injury was Arsenal's 890th since 2002, according to a specialist website .

He is one of eight Arsenal players currently unavailable for the first-team alongside Olivier Giroud, Mathieu Debuchy, Aaron Ramsey, Theo Walcott, Serge Gnabry, Yaya Sanogo, Mikel Arteta and David Ospina. Laurent Koscielny was on Thursday sent home by France following an injury scare and may also be unavailabe for Arsenal's game against Hull on October. Wenger has ordered an investigation into the number of injuries his side have had recently. There was particular bewilderment how influential midfielder Aaron Ramsey could have sustained a hamstring problem after last month's draw with Spurs having been trained lightly and rested from other games. The Arsenal manager revealed: 'We are getting things together, getting a report on all the different opinions – what happened to him, because it’s a real concern.' Aaron Ramsey is out of action with a hamstring strain and Wenger admitted it's a 'real concern' THEO WALCOTT . Called into the England squad at 17, Walcott's career has been dogged by injuries since. He hasn't played since January after rupturing the anterior cruciate ligament of his left knee against Tottenham, and missed the World Cup in Brazil. Theo Walcott is currently out after rupturing his anterior cruciate ligament against Tottenham . TOMAS ROSICKY . Averaged fewer than 20 games a season for Arsenal since signing in 2006 with ankle and hamstring problems a major factor. His worse spell out came when he limped off against Newcastle with a hamstring tear in January 2008 and didn't play again until the September of the following year. Tomas Rosicky has been plagued by injuries since he joined Arsenal in 2006 . JACK WILSHERE . Had a stop-start career at Arsenal due to injuries despite making his debut for the club at 16. Missed the entire 2011-12 season after a stress fracture ankle injury sustained in a pre-season friendly against New York Red Bulls. Jack Wilshere missed the entire 2011-12 season and still seems susceptible to niggling injuries . AARON RAMSEY . Arsene Wenger claimed it took Ramsey three years to fully get over the double-break of his leg after a challenge by Ryan Shawcross of Stoke City in 2010. The fall-out caused bad blood between the two clubs with Stoke arguing that Shawcross had become a scapegoat when it was an honest challenge for the ball. **GRAPHIC CONTENT** Aaron Ramsey broke his leg in a challenge with Stoke's Ryan Shawcross in 2009 . EDUARDO . Suffered a sickening broken leg against Birmingham City in 2008 that ended Arsenal's title challenge that season and effectively Eduardo's career at Arsenal. Although the Brazilian-born Croatia forward did return to play for the first-team, he never reached his previous heights and was sold in 2010. **GRAPHIC CONTENT** Eduardo was also the victim of a horror challenge, this time from Martin Taylor . ABOU DIABY . Supposed to be the long-term successor to Patrick Vieira, Diaby's career was damaged when he broke his ankle after a bad tackle on him by Sunderland's Dan Smith in 2006. Still to make his 100th Premier League start for the club despite being the club's longest-serving player. Abou Diaby is yet to make his 100th Premier League start despite being the club's longest-serving player . But the underlying statistics hint at a longer-term problem at the club. Since they won the Double in 2002, Arsenal have picked up nearly two fresh injuries a week during season-time with some of their stars particularly affected, notably Walcott, Jack Wilshere, Tomas Rosicky and Abou Diaby. Their total number of injuries, 890, compares unfavourably to other clubs over the same time period. Manchester United have had 794, Tottenham 788, Everton 666, Chelsea 622, Manchester City 596, Aston Villa 578 and Liverpool 553. Newcastle United have had 777 injuries in the Premier League over the period since 2002 and that doesn't include their one season in the Championship in that time. Mathieu Debuchy has been missing for Arsenal since picking up an injury against Manchester City last month . While Wenger is keen to improve the injury situation, he and Arsenal would argue that some of the more serious problems have been unavoidable. Ramsey didn't play again for the Gunners for 13 months after infamously breaking his leg against Stoke City in February 2010. Diaby's problems seemed to start when a bad tackle by Sunderland's Dan Smith caused a broken ankle that kept him out of Premier League action for nine months.

Bookmakers drop their odds on Van Gaal leaving Old Trafford every time United concede, and that has happened 13 times in seven games so far.

"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers felt Everton's Gareth Barry was lucky to stay on the field at Anfield – and most neutral observers would agree with him. Barry was cautioned in the second-minute for a foul on Adam Lallana and then blocked Raheem Sterling's shot with his arm inside the penalty area after eight minutes. Referee Martin Atkinson waved away the penalty appeals and then spared Barry again after 10 minutes when he clipped Mario Balotelli. Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers has questioned Martin Atkinson's decision to not send off Gareth Barry . Barry was booked in the second minute after a reckless challenge on Liverpool's Adam Lallana . The Liverpool boss felt Barry should have been penalised for handling the ball inside the penalty area . The Liverpool playmaker looked in some pain after the challenge but was able to carry on playing . Barry raised his hand to block a shot from Liverpool's Raheem Sterling in the ninth minute . Rodgers said only half in jest: 'Gareth Barry grabbed it with both arms. It was nearly a save! And Martin (Atkinson) had a good look at it. 'For us it was a clear penalty. If the ball strikes your hand around the waste, that is one thing, but his arms were up above his head. If the penalty had been given, he (Barry) would have gone and maybe that was in the referee's mind.' Rodgers also praised Balotelli for refusing to react to some heavy Everton tackling. 'I think it is important for him to focus on his game. You only have a chance to win if you have 11 players on the field,' said the Reds manager. 'I thought his work rate was excellent.'","Everton ace Gareth Barry was lucky to escape a second yellow card .

"Everton have discovered they are surprisingly popular in the southern Russian city of Krasnodar, where Roberto Martinez is expected to play a number of his big-hitters in the Europa League on Thursday. Martinez and a travelling squad boasting Romelu Lukaku, Leighton Baines and Tim Howard were pleasantly taken back to find dozens of fans who call themselves Russian Toffees greet them at the local airport after a four-hour flight from Merseyside. 'I saw them all with blue shirts on and thought they had travelled from Liverpool,' said Martinez. 'But they told me “No, we are Russian”. They told me the club has had big support in the country ever since Andrei Kanchelskis played at Goodison.'

Everton's Phil Jagielka jumps over a pile of balls in Krasnodar . Everton's line up and how things stand in Group H . To keep up the charm offensive, Everton's Republic of Ireland international Aiden McGeady, who spent three years at Spartak Moscow, then addressed a part of his pre-match media conference in near-fluent Russian, earning a round of applause. 'I was sitting there thinking I couldn't go through the whole thing in English,' smiled McGeady. 'Some of the Everton lads did tell me when we landed “I don't know how you could have played out here” but I enjoyed playing and living here. 'Krasnodar are like a lot of Russian clubs, they have signed quite a few foreign players and are technically quite good. I think it's good for British and Irish players to go away sometimes and experience new things. 'I was 24 when I left Celtic to come here and I don't regret it at all, the only time things went sour came in the last few weeks when I was told to train with the youth team because I didn't want to sign a new contract.' Everton boss Roberto Martinez and Aiden McGeady speak at press conference on Wednesday . Martinez poses with a young fan after Everton landed in Russia on Wednesday . The long journey facing Everton this week . Russian authorities, hit by a number of scandals ahead of their hosting of the 2018 World Cup, will be glad that Everton are held in high affection given that any repeat of the racial abuse aimed at Manchester City's Yaya Toure by CSKA Moscow fans last season will make unwanted headlines around the world. On the field of play, Martinez has tapped into McGeady's knowledge of Russian football, and also that of striker Samuel Eto'o, who played briefly for Anzi. McGeady played with two of Krasnodar's players at Spartak – Brazilian striker Ari and goalkeeper Andriy Dykan. He revealed: 'The manager has asked me about their strengths and what sort of players they are, but I think he (Martinez) knows all about them anyway – you what he's like when it comes to football! Everton's Aiden McGeady can speak near-fluent in Russian after spending three years at Spartak Moscow . Everton currently lie 15th in the Premier League having won just one game this season. But their Europa League campaign began with a comprehensive 4-1 victory over Wolfsburg. Martinez has brought a strong squad for the 4,800-mile round trip unlike manager of some English clubs in the past, including Martin O'Neill who fell out with Aston Villa fans after fielding a weakened team in Moscow. Those Everton players left behind this week Kevin Mirallas, Steven Pienaar, Seamus Coleman and James McCarthy all have knocks and veteran Sylvain Distin is being rested to avoid any muscular problems. Everton keeper Tim Howard was in the squad which made the trip to Russia for the game . 'Everton have a long history in Europe and we were desperate to qualify,' said Martinez. 'This is our first time in Europe and we want to show what we can do.' The club haven't faced an away game in Europe since they lost to Sporting Lisbon under David Moyes in 2010 and Martinez is looking at some stage to use the experience of Samuel Eto'o, a Champions League winner with Barcelona and Inter Milan, against opponents who are unbeaten this season and fourth in their domestic league. 'Samuel is more than a player in the dressing-room, he sets the standards for the others,' said Martinez. Everton have taken a strong squad including Romelu Lukaku to Russia for Europa League tie . Everton defender Leighton Baines was keen to keep a low profile at the airport . The Spaniard, whose glass is always half-full, refuses to blame Europe for the club's current injury list. Indeed, he thinks all his missing players have a chance of making Sunday's game against Manchester United – except Mirallas who pulled up with a hamstring injury against Liverpool on Satuday. 'He's had a couple of scans but we won't know the true extent of the injury for 48 hours because of the inflammation. But he could be kept out for a while,' said the Everton boss.","Everton were greeted by dozens of Russian Toffees when they landed in Krasnodar on Wednesday .

If goalkeeper Tim Howard faces Krasnodar on Thursday he will become the club’s record appearance maker in Europe. Sylvan Distin, who has not played since the 3-0 League Cup defeat at Swansea, and midfielder Steven Pienaar who collected a groin injury at the end of August were also left behind on Merseyside.

"The presence of 33-year-old Gareth Barry in southern Russia for Thursday night's game against Krasnodar underlines that Everton and their manager Roberto Martinez are taking the Europa League seriously. Barry was one of the Aston Villa players controversially left out of a tie in the same competition against CSKA Moscow in 2009 – a move that backfired on manager Martin O'Neill who was pilloried by fans thereafter and resigned the following year. Yet, despite being sandwiched between big Premier League clashes against Liverpool and Manchester United, Barry has been asked to travel nearly 5,000 miles by Martinez – as have other big-hitters Tim Howard, Leighton Baines, Phil Jagielka and Romelu Lukaku. Roberto Martinez wants to win the Europa League and has selected a strong squad to face Krasnodar . Martinez, in his first European campaign as a manager and already with three points on the board after beating Wolfsburg, says emphatically: 'Of course we are taking this seriously. I don’t think it is a question mark. 'We got in Europe because we worked hard for 12 months. If we want to carry on developing and growing we need to develop a winning mentality and to do that we need to be ready for the next game. 'I think the squad is big enough, we have had a few injuries and they are going to put a bit of pressure in terms of demands on certain players and we maybe have to regenerate them further down the line in the season. 'In terms of taking the game seriously, I expect every game to be a real test to go as far as we can go and I want that to be the mentality in the club. We cannot afford to dismiss any game this season, it is the opposite. Garteh Barry was left out of the Aston Villa  squad for their 2009 UEFA Cup tie against CSKA Moscow . 'I always felt that European football is part of our DNA, we started back in this competition in the 50s and every opportunity to create a good memory we take it with both hands. 'It is the first time we have come to Russia, yes we will make changes but that does not mean we don’t want to win. We expect that everyone on the pitch knows what it means to play for Everton and wants to win. And they will be able to cope with this club wanting to win every game, that’s the mentality.' If Howard gets the nod over Joel Robles, it will be the American goalkeeper's 21st game in Europe for Everton – a club record. Kevin Mirallas is out of the match and will be on the sidelines for around eight weeks with a hamstring injury . Manchester United await on Sunday lunchtime and three players with injury problems James McCarthy, Seamus Coleman and Steven Pienaar have stayed at home for treatment. It is possible all three will be able to face United, with Pienaar considered likeliest. Belgian international Kevin Mirallas is also missing with a hamstring injury that is likely to keep him out for several weeks. Krasnodar, formed as recently as 2008, are unbeaten in the Russian League this season after nine games though they are also something of draw specialists and got a 1-1 result in Lille in their opening group game. Everton's 500-strong army of travelling fans will be supplemented by a group of Russian Toffees, a fan club set up after former Russian international Andriy Kanchelskis played at Goodison Park.

"CLICK HERE for your ultimate stats with our Match Zone from the Kuban Stadium, including a look at how Everton conceding the first goal . Samuel Eto’o rolled back the years to spare the blushes of his Everton captain Phil Jagielka in Russia on Thursday night. Eto’o, a Champions League winner with Barcelona and Inter Milan and one of the greatest strikers of his generation, can’t run around like he used to but at 33 he still has the instinct and sense of timing of a genuine star. With eight minutes left and Everton lucky to be only one behind against lively Russian opponents, Leighton Baines fired in a cross from the right having stayed up from taking a corner. Until that moment, Krasnodar had dealt with Everton’s threat but this time Eto’o ghosted ahead of their back line and finished with a left-foot volley from close range that typified composure and class. Samuel Eto'o (5) wheels away in celebration as the former Barcelona striker scores Everton's equalising goal against Krasnodar on Thursday night . Eto'o holds a fist towards the Everton fans after scoring in a game which looked destined to end as a 1-0 victory for the Russian side . The former Cameroon forward got a slight touch on a Leighton Baines cross, but it was enough to put Everton level in the 82nd minute .

Subs not used: Robles (Gk), Browning, Alcaraz, Oviedo, Besic, Naismith . Booked: Lukaku . Goal: Eto'o 82' Referee: Huseyin Gocek (Turkey) 7 . *Player rating by JOE BERNSTEIN at the Kuban Stadium . Manager Roberto Martinez had given Eto’o a rare start partly because of past experience playing in the Russian League for Anzhi — and he felt the decision paid off. ‘Sometimes, you know what to expect when you’ve played in a certain country. Samuel knew the way the game is played in Russia, you have to wait for certain moments. I thought he was very composed and was waiting for that moment when an opportunity came. The finish was of the highest quality.’ ‘I was surprised how well Krasnodar played. I knew they were good but they kept their energy levels high for an hour. For us, the pleasing thing is how hard we had to work to get the result, which we did. ‘We didn’t have enough attacking play to see how good our strikers were but Samuel has great experience in European football and if anyone was going to score, it was him.’ Although second-best on Thursday night, Everton are now well-placed to qualify for the knockout stages of the Europa League, having beaten Wolfsburg 4-1 in their opening group game. Martinez picked a strong side to please the 400 Everton fans who had made a 4,800-mile round trip to southern Russia. But Krasnodar were quicker and hungrier in the first hour with Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard having to make fine saves from Marat Izmailov and Artur Jedrzejczyk. Howard’s luck ran out after 43 minutes though the goal was self-inflicted from an Everton point of view. Odil Ahmedov clipped a pass over Jagielka’s head towards Mauricio Pereyra and when the Everton skipper tried to hook the ball away he knocked it straight to Brazilian forward Ari, who took advantage of the gift with a cracking finish from 18 yards. It marked a sudden downturn in Jagielka’s fortunes after his spectacular injury-time equaliser against Liverpool in the Merseyside derby on Saturday. Martinez responded quickly and threw on £28million record signing Romelu Lukaku at the interval for Christian Atsu.

Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard (above) gestures to his team-mates as Everton play out the 1-1 draw in Russia . Chelsea loanee Christian Atsu (centre) was substituted for Romelu Lukaku at the break after a disappointing first half . ‘Romelu gave us a focal point,’ admitted the Everton boss, though his side nearly went 2-0 down after 64 minutes when Krasnodar substitute Wanderson went round three defenders, including Jagielka, before hitting the crossbar. It looked gloomy for Everton but you can never write off a team that has Eto’o up front. Although his link-up play with Lukaku was non-existent, the Cameroon striker is still a great fox-in-the-box and when Baines got his delivery right, he needed no second invitation. It was probably more than the Merseysiders deserved — but Lukaku even had a chance for a late winner, his header lacking the power to beat Andriy Dykan. Their thoughts now turn to the Premier League where they travel to Manchester United on Sunday. And Martinez must hope James McCarthy, Steven Pienaar and Seamus Coleman, all injured for the trip to Russia, are fit enough to play a part. Russia's soldiers supporters of FC Krasnodar get behind their team for the the UEFA Europe League group H clash . Phil Jagielka attempts to get past Krasnodor's Ricardo Laborde (right) during the second half in Russia . Aiden McGeady, who used to play with Krasnodar goalscorer Ari at Spartak Moscow, admitted: ‘They have strengthened since I left Russia and looked a good team. ‘It is never easy to come here, after a four-and-a-half-hour flight, legs were heavy. But not having ideal preparation is part of European football and we have four points.’ One pleasing aspect for everyone was that there was no discernible racial behaviour from Krasnodar fans towards Eto’o and Atsu following recent high-profile cases in Russia which have seen Yaya Toure and Christopher Samba abused. Indeed, most of the jeering from Krasnodar fans fell to McGeady because of his Spartak connections.

"Eight of Liverpool's starting line-up were signed by Brendan Rodgers, confirmation of the impact he's had in little over two years at Anfield. The three he inherited weren't too shabby either; Steve Gerrard (homegrown), Raheem Sterling (signed by Rafa Benitez) and Jordan Henderson (Kenny Dalglish) The match against Ludogorets was Brendan Rodgers' first as a manager, and Liverpool's first in five years . More people at Anfield than in whole of Razgrad . There were a few empty seats at Anfield but the 43,307 crowd was still larger than the entire population of Razgrad, the north-eastern Bulgrian town that Ludogorets come from. That is estimated at around 38,000. There were more than 43,000 people at Anfield, more than the entire population of Razgrad . Henderson's first match as vice-captain . Jordan Henderson led by example in his first outing since being named the club's official vice-captain to Steven Gerrard. It wasn't the easiest evening for Liverpool but Henderson showed incredible energy and always tried to make himself available for the man on the ball. He might not be another Gerrard, but he'll be a good captain in years to come, possibly for England too. It was former Sunderland midfielder Jordan Henderson's first game as Liverpool's vice-captain . Is Adam Lallana the new Joe Allen? Early days yet but Brendan Rodgers will be hoping Adam Lallana isn't this year's Joe Allen. Fine player and all that but so far he just seems a bit overawed. He scuffed a great chance to put Liverpool ahead, at which point the camera rather unkindly panned to the injured Daniel Sturridge, sitting in the stands. Liverpool signed Adam Lallana for £23million from Southampton but he has failed to impress thus far . Steven Gerrard sets new milestone . At 34 years, 109 days, Steve Gerrard became the sixth-oldest Liverpool player in Europe, following Gary McAllister, Ian Callaghan, Jamie Carragher, Bruce Grobbelaar and Sami Hyypia. He was a player Brendan Rodgers felt he couldn't leave out despite the ageing skipper having faced Aston Villa 72 hours earlier.

"David Beckham has hailed new Three Lions captain Wayne Rooney as the ‘most respected player in the England team’ and says leading his country will be the greatest honour he’ll ever have in football. Beckham, who skippered England on 59 occasions to become the country’s most iconic football captain since Bobby Moore, gave his blessing of the changing of the guard from Steve Gerrard to Rooney on a visit to The FA’s training base at St George’s Park. Ahead of England’s first Euro 2016 qualifier against Switzerland on Monday, Beckham said: ‘It’s no surprise to me at all that Wayne has been made captain. He is one of the most experienced players in the team and the most respected player in the team. Pinnacle: Wayne Rooney, training here at St George's, will not have a higher honour than captaining England . We go again! Roy Hodgson prepares England for their opening Euro 2016 qualifier against Switzerland . ‘Young players will look up to him for inspiration; he’s a player who wears his heart on his sleeve. ‘People want to see that passion; you fight for every ball and celebrate every goal you score, or every goal you set up. That’s what Wayne’s all about. Wayne’ s such a great talent, such a great player, people love him, fans love him and it’s great to see him with the armband. It’s something I know he’ll cherish.’ Beckham played with a young Rooney at Euro 2004 and advises the Manchester United striker to enjoy being England captain, admitting it’s the thing he misses most since retiring from football. The former United, Real Madrid and LA Galaxy star, who was capped 115 times by England and was at one time the most famous sportsman on the planet, said: ‘Being captain means more in England than any other country. You really know how important it is when you are part of the squad. Good start: Rooney scored the winning goal against Norway in his first game as captain . Greece is the word: David Beckham rates being named England captain as his proudest moment . ‘As a kid I was a Manchester United fan but my dream like like every kid was to play for England. ‘I got the opportunity and to be captain 59 times was incredible. When I look back at my career since retiring, playing for England was the thing I’ve really missed. It was my proudest moment to get the armband.’ Beckham, now 39, popped into St George’s Park on a family trip at the weekend and admitted he was stunned by the facilities to all England squads, from women’ s and junior teams to the senior side under Roy Hodgson. Rooney poses with former England striker Michael Owen (L) during England training . ‘It is really amazing, I’m so impressed, ‘ he said. ‘It’s peaceful, and you can feel it respects the history of our game even though this particular facility has only been open for two years. ‘It’s nice to hear rooms are named after certain players and the fans have voted for like the ‘Paul Gascoigne Room’ or the ‘Bobby Moore Room’. It’s special. ‘Obviously we always played on nice pitches, but to have pitch like this to train on every day is incredible. I’ve not been to many facilities around the world as good as this. “For our players, it’s place where you can rest and prepare. It’s great for young players to come and aspire to be great England players in the future.’ What's next? Beckham, ambassador for Sainsbury's Active Kids, has not ruled out a management career . Beckham is busy trying to build a new MLS franchise in Miami but hasn’t ruled out trying to coach one day in the future. ‘At the moment I am happy doing what I am doing, but you never know, in a few years I might change my mind,’ he said. ‘It is great for coaches to get the chance to come to St George’s and do their qualifications.

"If Martin Demichelis had asked for a new contract six months ago, you would have heard the groans from Manchester City fans all the way down to his native Cordoba in Argentina. It was only a man-of-the-match performance against Hull City on March 15 following Vincent Kompany’s dismissal that belatedly gave City fans a glimpse of the real Demichelis, who had previously looked slow, cumbersome and earned a red card against Barcelona that killed City’s Champions League prospects. Since then, he’s hardly put a foot wrong from playing in a World Cup final for Argentina to scoring City’s crucial equaliser at Arsenal on Saturday. Martin Demichelis has grown into playing centre-half for Manchester City over the last six months . The Argentine had an excellent World Cup and was a standout performer for the runners-up . Demichelis was a rock at the back for City during their 2-2 draw against Arsenal on Saturday . So, when at the age of 34 and on the eve or a return to his former club Bayern Munich whom City face in the Champions League on Wednesday night, Demichelis hints he’d expect a renewal of his contract when it runs out this summer, the reaction from fans is wholehearted agreement rather than laughter. After all, Demichelis has played so well alongside Kompany this season, Manuel Pellegrini’s £32million marquee summer signing Eliaquim Mangala hasn’t been given a look in so far. He may have chopped off his ponytail for the World Cup but unlike Samson, it hasn’t mean losing any of his strength. Demichelis is following in a long line of centre-halves from Manchester United’s Gary Pallister to Per Mertesacker at Arsenal who have suffered terrible starts with new clubs before winning fans over and being fondly remembered. Pellegrini, who also had him at Malaga, won’t be surprised in the transformation. He’s always claimed Demichelis ‘is a very important player for us.’ Demichelis is set to be handed a new contract by Manuel Pellegrini at the Etihad Stadium . The 34-year-old's luck changed during a sterling performance against Hull City back in March . The City boss keeps his cards too close to his chest to explain exactly why, but in a Sportsmail interview, Barcelona and Spain legend Xavi, who faced Demichelis many times, offered an insight. ‘Demichelis has been criticised but he can bring the ball out well from the back in order to get the team playing football. That is want Pellegrini wants to do,’ said Xavi. A commanding figure who is good on the ball and in the air, Demichelis’s form was noted back home in South America, leading to his World Cup call up with manager Alex Sabella saying: ‘He had a great season in the English league which is extremely difficult competitive and physical. He responded well and I could not afford to leave him out,’ said Sabella. And while some players have suffered post-World Cup hangovers, Demichelis has taken off this season where he left off. Hence his appeal to be given a new deal by the club, who have already signed up Kompany, Samir Nasri, Sergio Aguero and David Silva. Vincent Kompany was awarded a new five-year contract by the Premier League champions last month . Sergio Aguero has also committed himself to Manchester City for the foreseeable future . ‘I am playing every game, every two to three days,’ said the popular defender. ‘I would be happy to stay this year and then one more year because I think I will still have the quality to play at this level.’ ‘The people who criticised me need to be more respectful of me and what I have done in my career.’ That career includes a Champions League final appearance for Bayern although they lost to Jose Mourinho’s Inter Milan. It will be a special return for him in the Olympic Stadium on Wednesday, where City won last season in the group stages though Pellegrini was criticised for not knowing one more goal would have allowed them to win the group and avoid Barca in the last-16.

"Everton enjoyed their first European night since 2009, seeing off German side Wolfsburg 4-1 at Goodison Park. A Ricardo Rodriguez own goal set Roberto Martinez's side on their way, before full backs Seamus Coleman and Leighton Baines each scored. Kevin Mirallas added a fourth late on after being put through by Samuel Eto'o as Martinez was given the perfect welcome to European football, and not even a brilliant stoppage-time Rodriguez free kick could dampen the high spirits at Goodison Park. Sportsmail's Joe Bernstein was there and rates the Everton players' performances below. Steven Naismith celebrates Everton's first goal which came when his shot was deflected in by a defender . Tim Howard 7.5 . Not quite his USA World Cup heroics but an obstinate barrier nonetheless with a particularly fine diving stop from Luis Gustavo. Seamus Coleman 7.5 . Had the legs to face up to the challenge of facing former Chelsea winger Kevin De Bruyne, and even popped up in the opposition penalty area to nod Everton'a second. Seamus Coleman heads in Everton's second goal during a clinical performance against Wolfsburg . Seamus Coleman defended solidly against danger man Kevin De Bruyne and popped up with a goal . John Stones 6.5 . Been quite a season for the England new-boy and this was another no-nonsense display belying his years. Phil Jagielka 6.5 . Captain led by example, constantly encouraging and digging out colleagues. Not in his best form bit certainly not hiding. Leighton Baines 8 . There is no finer sight than Baines roaring forward from left-back. His surge and supply to Naismith led to the opening goal and as usual he made no mistake from the spot for number three. Star man. Leighton Baines tucks away his penalty during an excellent performance that saw him star for Everton . Gareth Barry 6 . Just his presence is reassuring for Roberto Martinez given his experience. Provided the security so Baines and Coleman could bomb forward. James McCarthy 6 . Ditto Barry. Didn't try anything spectacular but that is what Martinez wants, covered the hard yards to help keep Wolfsburg out. Aiden McGeady 6 . Technically gifted, it was one of those evenings where a lot of his best work went unrewarded until he was fouled outside the area - and the referee awarded a penalty! Steven Naismith 7.5 . On Scottish referendum day, it was almost inevitable he should have a stormer. The Everton faithful chanted his name after his shot led to Ricardo Rodriguez's own goal. Steven Naismith runs at the Wolfsburg defence during a typically tenacious display at Goodison Park . Kevin Mirallas 5.5 One of four Belgians on show but it didn't inspire him. Ran down too many blind alleys. Booked but did partially redeem himself by scoring a well-taken late fourth. Romelu Lukaku 6 . It's not quite happening for the £28million striker. Had a wild slash into the sidenetting with a decent chance and failed when he took a free-kick in Leighton Baines territory. Romelu Lukaku was unable to produce his best play but worked hard as Everton's target man . Subs: . Samuel Eto'o (for Lukaku 69) 6 . Multiple Champions League winner worked hard enough while slumming it in the Europa League. Darron Gibson (for Steven Naismith 82) Manager: Roberto Martinez 7.5 .

"For all the moves before 11pm, click here . The Fabio Borini saga is not dead with Liverpool wanting to reach a deal where the Italian joins Sunderland on a permanent basis. AC Milan are interested in a loan for the Italian striker but Liverpool would prefer to recoup the £12million they paid for the striker in 2012.

"Liverpool have agreed to let defender Sebastian Coates join Sunderland on a season-long loan to link up with fellow Uruguayan Gus Poyet. Sunderland have sorted out terms for the 23-year-old central defender who faced England at last summer’s World Cup and the move is to be confirmed officially on deadline day. Coates becomes the fourth defender allowed to leave Anfield this summer following Daniel Agger, Martin Kelly and Jack Robinson, with manager Brendan Rodgers pinning his faith in Martin Skrtel, Mamadou Sakho, Dejan Lovren and Kolo Toure at the heart of the defence. Loan ranger: Uruguayan defender Sebastian Coates will join Sunderland on a season-long loan deal . Fellow countryman: Sunderland boss Gus Poyet has agreed a deal with Liverpool to sign his compatriot . The blonde defender was signed by Kenny Dalglish in 2011 who said ‘we are looking for him to have a long career here’. But he has made just six Premier League starts in three seasons. With Sunderland willing to pay a loan fee and grant him regular first-team experience, Liverpool have been happy to sanction his departure. He is the second Uruguayan to leave Anfield this window following Luis Suarez's high-profile move to Barcelona. Ironically, Coates replaced Suarez soon after the striker had scored what turned out to be the winning goal against England in Uruguay’s 2-1 World Cup victory in Sao Paulo. Poyet, who had also been linked with Manchester City defender Micah Richards, was anxious to shore up Sunderland's defence after failing to win any of their first three league games this season.

"Such is the strength of Manchester City’s squad this season, even the most expensive defender in the Premier League, £32million Eliaquim Mangala, acknowledges he isn’t guaranteed a regular starting place. Mangala will miss out when the champions kick off their title defence against Newcastle United having only arrived at the club from Porto on Monday. But even when fully up to speed, the Frenchman faces competition from club captain Vincent Kompany and World Cup finalist Martin Demichelis in the centre of defence. Matija Nastasic, 21, has already won 13 caps for Serbia. Transfer: French defender Eliaquim Mangala joined Manchester City for £32m from Porto . ‘Guarantees don’t exist, what really counts is how I play in training sessions and games when I get the chance. Everybody in the squad wants to play and you can only put 11 players in the side,’ said Mangala. ‘The only thing you can do as a player is make your own guarantees by doing well in training and giving the manager a difficult decision. There are plenty of games this season and I am sure I will get my chance.’ Pellegrini has added Mangala, goalkeeper Willy Caballero, right-back Bacary Sagna and midfielders Fernando, Frank Lampard and Bruno Zuculini to a squad already good enough to win the league. He now has two top-quality players for every position which means he can choose between England No1 Joe Hart and Caballero in goal, or Stevan Jovetic, Edin Dzeko and Sergio Aguero up front. The canny Chilean even has the resources to rest some of his World Cup stars for their Premier League opener in the north-east. Competition: Managala faces stiff competition if he wants to partner Vincent Kompany in defence . Pellegrini had seven of his players from Argentina, Brazil, France and Belgium reach the knockout stages in Brazil. Some of them, like Kompany, may be asked to face Newcastle after last Sunday’s 3-0 defeat in the Community Shield - but not all. ‘The most important thing is for players to have the rest that they need particularly between one season and the next,’ said the City boss, who will be wary of throwing in Aguero after his muscular problems last season. ‘Most summers you have the World Cup or European Championship or Copa America, it is very difficult. That’s why I think players have so many injuries. Not only in our team, in every team. ‘If I put all the World Cup players in together, maybe after 50 minutes they would not continue. We will try to make a mix. Of the eight who arrived late to pre-season, we will see which of them are in the right condition to play.’ New boys: Bacary Sagna and Eliaquim Mangala train for Manchester City . Pressure: The 23-year-old says he isn't worried about his price tag as he didn't set it . Mangala glimpsed the size of his new club on Thursday evening when he joined his team-mates at a glamorous event called City Live, in which 5,000 fans turned up to see the new signings and hear a musical set from legendary Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr. The 23-year-old isn’t daunted by the size of his price tag which eclipses the record amount paid by Manchester United for Rio Ferdinand in 2002. ‘The price wasn’t set by me and it’s something I don’t pay attention to. If you can’t live with that sort of pressure, football isn’t the job for you. Stay at home and do another type of job,’ he said. ‘I’m here because it’s a chance to play alongside other quality players. From a career development point of view and to progress as a player, City were the club for me.’ Right move: Mangala said that Manchester City were the perfect club for him after leaving Porto . He is setting his targets high, and not just domestically. ‘As current champions, the first thing is to hold onto that title. And the big picture for City has always been to try and ultimately win the Champions League, so I think it has to remain a big target for us.’ Mangala thinks he will be fit enough to fight for a place by the end of the month. Today, some of the scrutiny will be on the dug-outs following a bust-up last season between manager Alan Pardew and Pellegrini. The Newcastle boss apologised for swearing at his counterpart and was later banned after headbutting David Meyler of Hull City. International: Eliaquim Mangala comforts Antoine Griezmann after they lost to Germany at the World Cup . Pellegrini bears no grudge and says he personally finds it helpful to stay calm after being more hotheaded earlier in his career as a player. ‘The most important thing is to be winning the game, not to be fighting with other managers,’ he said. ‘I think if you are not calm, you are nervous, then you are not in the right mood at the right time. ‘I was another character when I was younger. More explosive and wanting to fight with other players. ‘After I finished my career as a player and started as a manager, I realised you must talk to all the other players in a calm way.’","Manchester City signed Eliaquim Mangala for £32m .

"Nemanja Vidic continued his nightmare start to his Inter Milan career - giving away a penalty as the Nerazzurri crashed to a humiliating 4-1 defeat to bottom-of-the-table Cagliari at the San Siro. Cagliari had lost its last three matches but gained an advantage when Inter captain Yuto Nagatomo was sent off in the 27th minute following two yellow cards. Albin Ekdal, who had scored three goals in 87 appearances for Cagliari, doubled his tally for the club with a 15-minute hat trick.

It would have been worse for Inter if Samir Handanovic had not saved a penalty after Vidic's mistake. 'I made some mistakes when evaluating the squad rotation,' Inter coach Walter Mazzarri said. 'When we were down to 10 men we should have acted differently: an experienced team would've sat back, not conceded four in the first half and tried to come back in the second.' Napoli won 1-0 at Sassuolo in the lunchtime kickoff, while 10-man AC Milan was held to a 1-1 draw at Cesena. Fiorentina also drew 1-1 at Torino as did Chievo Verona at home to Empoli. Juventus and Roma both maintained their perfect start to the season with victories on Saturday. Inter Milan manager Walter Mazzarri reacts during the match in what was a very hard-to-take defeat . Cagliari took the lead in the 10th minute when Nagatomo failed to deal with a long ball and headed straight at Marco Sau, who fired home. But Inter was back on level terms eight minutes later when Rodrigo Palacio took a free kick quickly and set up Pablo Osvaldo. The turning point came shortly afterward when Nagatomo picked up two yellow cards in as many minutes and was dismissed. Cagliari immediately restored its advantage as Handanovic did well to parry a fierce strike from Daniele Dessena, but Ekdal pounced on the rebound. Ekdal doubled his tally five minutes later, tapping in Victor Ibarbo's cross after a great run from the Colombia winger who had bamboozled the Inter defense. It almost got worse shortly before halftime when Vidic mistimed a sliding tackle on Sau in the area. However, spot-kick specialist Handanovic saved Andrea Cossu's penalty. Napoli's Jose Callejon celebrates after scoring the only goal of the game against Sassuolo . But Cagliari did get a fourth moments later when Ekdal completed his hat trick after Inter failed to clear a corner. Osvaldo thought he had pulled one back for Inter shortly after the interval but his effort was ruled out for offside. City rival Milan was also forced to play at a numerical disadvantage after Cristian Zapata was sent off in the 73rd minute for denying Gregoire Defrel a clear scoring opportunity. Cesena had taken a shock lead in the 10th minute when Christian Abbiati - replacing the injured Diego Lopez - fumbled a simple attempt from Guido Marilungo and Davide Succi was on hand to tap in the rebound. Jeremy Menez almost recorded his fourth goal of the season but it was struck off after Fernando Torres was adjudged to be offside. Milan did level in the 19th when Adil Rami headed in Keisuke Honda's corner. Adil Rami celebrates with Fernando Torres on his shoulders after grabbing AC Milan's equaliser in Cesena . Stefano Lucchini thought he had snatched all three points for Cesena at the death, but the referee had already stopped play for Emmanuel Cascione's push on Mattia De Sciglio. In the early match, Jose Callejon scored the only goal of the game in the 28th minute when he was on hand at the back post to tap in Gonzalo Higuain's cross. Sassuolo almost snatched a late equalizer but Federico Peluso's deflected effort crashed off the crossbar. The pressure had been mounting on Benitez, who had guided the southern club to just two wins in seven matches in all competitions this season. Napoli had just one point in its last three Serie A matches. In Turin, the home side broke the deadlock shortly after the hour mark when Bruno Peres' pull back set up Quagliarella, who carved out space for himself under pressure and drilled into the far bottom corner. Khouma Babacar leveled 12 minutes from time after a delightful through ball by substitute Federico Bernardeschi with his first touch.","Nemanja Vidic conceded a penalty in Inter's heavy defeat to Cagliari .

"Sol Campbell rubbished Arsene Wenger's complaints about Tottenham's defensive style - instead blaming his side's slow build-up play for their 1-1 draw in the North London derby. Former Arsenal and Spurs centre back Campbell was speaking as a pundit on Sky Sports and refused to accept Wenger's excuse that Tottenham 'didn't play' as the Gunners lost more ground on early title favourites Chelsea. Arsenal held an impressive 69 per cent of possession - something Wenger pointed out - but had to rely on Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's late equaliser to deny Tottenham an away win after Nacer Chadli's opener. Sol Campbell makes his point as he talks on Sky Sports during the Arsenal vs Tottenham coverage . Campbell sat alongside Jamie Redknapp as he gave a unique insight into the North London derby . And Campbell was unimpressed with his former manager's decision to blame a lack of ambition from Spurs on Arsenal's failure to take three points from Saturday's late kick-off. 'Arsenal should have realised that spurs wanted those two banks of four, to keep it tight,' Campbell said. 'Once Spurs moved it into the middle of the field that’s when they could counter-attack very quickly. But some of the buildup play was very lethargic and they were taking their time so that’s why Spurs got the result today. Arsene Wenger was unimpressed with Spurs' stubbornness in defence during the 1-1 draw at the Emirates .

"English referee Michael Oliver has been called up to a FIFA seminar for Europe's top young officials as football's governing body begin their early preparations for the 2018 World Cup in Russia. The 29-year-old ref, who took charge of Arsenal's 1-1 draw with Tottenham on Saturday, is the only English representative in a select group of 24 promising young officials earmarked as 'prespective referees' for future FIFA tournaments. Howard Webb - widely regarded as England's top referee after taking charge of 2010's World Cup and Champions League finals - retired this summer, allowing other Englishmen to step up including Mark Clattenburg, who was overlooked for this summer's finals in Brazil.

Callum Connolly scored twice as England's Under-18 side showed the future is bright with a 3-1 win over Holland at Bury's JD Stadium. Chelsea's 16-year-old centre forward Dominic Solanke grabbed the other goal to put a young Oranje side  to the sword on Thursday night - with Alessio da Cruz's strike not proving enough. Solanke has been earmarked as a future full international by Jose Mourinho and the young striker lived up to his reputation by converting a rebound to win England the game. Happy days: Dominic Solanke is all smiles after scoring the goal that won the game for England . Poacher: Solanke prepares to unleash the shot that led to his goal against Holland . The young lions started strong but it took them until three minutes before the break to open the scoring. Liverpool's Sheyi Ojo sent in a corner and after Taylor Moore knocked the ball down Everton academy man Connolly pounced from inside the six-yard box to give England the lead. Solanke went on to double the lead with the goal that proved to be the winner on 56 minutes. After latching onto Spurs' Josh Onomah's intricate through ball Solanke saw his first strike at goal saved but it wasn't held by Yanick van Osch and Solanke was on hand to convert the rebound. Alessio da Cruz halved the deficit from 20 yards but it was not enough and Connolly grabbed his second from left-back after Josh Sims ball into the box.

"England Under 19s kept their 100 per cent record in Euro 2015 qualifying with a hard-fought 4-2 win over Belgium as both sides reached the elite round. Fulham's Patrick Roberts and Middlesbrough's Bradley Fewster grabbed first-half goals before Brandon Barker and Fewster's second secured the win after half-time. It was a third win in four days in the Luxembourg mini-tournament after England's victories over the hosts (8-0) and Belarus (3-0) had secured qualification.

Chelsea defender Ola Aina then smashed a long range effort of his own against the crossbar as England went in search of a winner before Barker and Fewster secured the win with the help of Roberts. First the Fulham forward combined well with Barker to let the latter finish past the keeper, before Fewster wrapped up the win by converting a Roberts cross.

"Chelsea playmaker Oscar has praised Cesc Fabregas' impact at Stamford Bridge - and already feels his partnership with the Spaniard can guide Chelsea to the Premier League title. Fabregas arrived in a £30million deal from Barcelona this summer and was seen by some as a replacement for Oscar in attacking midfield - but instead the pair started Chelsea's two opening games together before the Brazilian missed out at Everton through injury. And Oscar is already pleased with the way things are going, holding the belief that the similarity between himself and Fabregas makes them the perfect partnership to power Chelsea's midfield. VIDEO Scroll down to see Oscar's Brazilian show boat . Perfect pair? Oscar is enjoying playing alongside Cesc Fabregas in Chelsea's midfield this season . Pass master: Oscar reckons that he and Fabregas are very similar - and that helps Chelsea to win games .

'He plays very similarly to me – but we have worked very well together in the first games of this season and we also get on very well. He came into the team and immediately he fitted in very well. 'Coming deeper to get the ball is something that I’ve always done, but it is also something that the manager likes me to do and, in the same way, Fabregas and Willian also do it. Impressive: The Brazilian playmaker looked back to his best against Burnley in Chelsea's opening game . Club and country: Oscar identified Willian as another player who likes to drop back to find space .

"England's stars might have left the sparse Wembley crowd unconvinced against Norway - but the Three Lions stepped it up a notch in training in a video that will give fans travelling to Switzerland confidence. The behind closed doors clip shows Jack Wilshere and Wayne Rooney showing some of the sublime skill fans want to see as England open up their European Championships qualifying campaign on Monday in Basel. Wilshere is seen chipping balls into a bag as the players clear up after the session at St George's Park, while Rooney fools Joe Hart with a sublime chip. Hart is also seen volleying balls with his heel - although it's probably for the best he doesn't try that in a game England will want to take three points from. Skillful: Jack Wilshere flicks the balls up from the goalmouth before knocking them into a bag . Clear up: Wilshere made the job easier for those who had to clean up after England's training session . Don't try that on Monday!

With Daniel Sturridge out, the pressure will be on Wilshere and Rooney to provide flare through the middle in Basel, and judging by this video it shoudn't be a problem.

"Drugs cheats in athletics are running out of ways to escape their fate, according to a leading anti-doping authority. Abby Hoffman from the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) says that new innovations in technology means cheats who beat the system now will be caught in the future - with no place to hide after samples are retested. The use of archived samples has already seen 15 athletes retrospectively charged - and Hoffman believes that the new prospect of being caught in future should help stop athletes doping now. Speaking out: Abby Hoffman hopes that the changes in drug testing will help stop athletics cheats . Talking it through: Having spent years on fighting drugs, four-time Olympian Hoffman has seen a lot . And with competitors facing longer bans as the new four-year penalty for doping offences comes into effect in January - those who try to gain an unfair advantage need to watch their backs. 'The retesting is a really important innovation; the IAAF has been maintaining – that is retaining – samples since 2005, so we have samples from all of the medallists from our major events since 2005,' Hoffman said. And with reanalysis soon to be allowed up to 10 years (from eight) - there are more opportunities to stop cheats. Something to get sorted: Drugs in athletics are still a big problem but the changes could put off potential cheats . Innovation: Hoffman spoke about the retesting of samples that will stop today's cheats in years to come . 'The purpose of this is as testing science improves we are going back to samples that originally tested negative but now we have new methodology and we’re getting positive test results so this is absolutely critical, she added. 'I think it’s sending a very strong message to any athlete who is tempted to dope that the fact that you might not get caught today is not going to provide you with assurance about something that may happen in the next decade and given the rate of scientific progress I’d be thinking twice myself about doing something if I thought sometime in the next 10 years my sample might be retested.' The only route out for cheats is admission - as in the case of Tyson Gay, which saw the sprinter have his sentence reduced in a trade-off for information. Gay ended up with a one year ban. Returning: Tyson Gay only suffered from a one year drugs ban due to his willingness to provide information . Plea: Hoffman and the IAAF are hoping that the changes in the way tests are handled will stop doping . 'It sticks in my craw that Tyson Gay only gets the one-year penalty,' Hoffman said. 'There’s a trade-off: If we want to get information and intelligence that will help us better manage and curtail doping, then we’re going to have to bite our tongue, hold our nose, and a guy like Tyson Gay is going to get a penalty that is going to be reduced to one year. 'Under the new code he might not get a penalty all the way back to a single year.' Changing times: If Gay was caught next year under the new rules he might not get off as lightly .","Abby Hoffman says innovations in the industry are making it impossible for cheats to escape - whether that happens now or in the future .
The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) are keeping back old samples to test with new technology .
So far 15 athletes have lost out after their samples were later tested .
Science - in particular biological profiling - is evolving fast and making a difference as detection completely changes .
January 2015 will see new four-year penalty for doping offences come in .
Hoffman wants to see the likes of Tyson Gay get longer sentences even in a trade-off for information about doping ."

The Spain hitman picked up the problem while on international duty and left the Spanish squad ahead of their Euro 2016 qualifier against Macedonia to recover. Costa has four goals in his first three Premier League games, making a lightning start to his career at Stamford Bridge, but it was feared he could miss the trip to Everton last weekend with an injury and this new blow is a problem he suffered last season with Atletico Madrid.

"Ronald Koeman has backed his new goalkeeper Fraser Forster to snatch the England No 1 shirt from Joe Hart by impressing at Southampton. The Saints boss has been working with Forster for less than a week since the 26-year-old completed a £10million from Celtic - but already ranks him as having the ability to succeed Hart between the sticks. The Manchester City stopper faces a battle for his place at club level with Willy Caballero this summer and Koeman is backing Forster to shake up the order with the national team too - starting away at Liverpool on Sunday. Chance to impress: Ronald Koeman is backing Fraser Forster to challenge for an England starting spot . Lion's roar: Koeman reckons Forster could give Roy Hodgson something to think about in goal . 'It's a big challenge to play in the Premier League but, if he well, it's easier to be first choice for England,' Koeman said. 'He's got a good personality. He's very tall. If you see him in goal you'd think it's difficult to beat him. He's also a very good passer,' Koeman said in The Sun.

"Paul Scholes believes Raheem Sterling and Jack Wilshere should follow the lead of Juan Mata and play in next summer's European Under 21 Championship, should England qualify. Gareth Southgate's Young Lions take on Croatia in the first leg of their play-off at Molineux on Friday night and head into the match in fine form having won nine of their 10 group games. But former England and Manchester United midfielder Scholes writes in his Independent column that there needs to be a culture change if England are to succeed at Under 21 level. Jack Wilshere - man of the match against San Marino - will be eligible to play for the Under 21s next summer . Liverpool attacker Raheem Sterling should also go the European Under 21 Championship, says Paul Scholes . 'There are too many young players who, having made a senior debut, see a move to the Under 21s as a demotion,' Scholes argues. 'Calum Chambers is a prime example. He went from the Under 19s to the senior team. Then he was in the Under 21s squad this week until the injury to John Stones meant that he returned to the seniors. 'I have no reason to doubt that Chambers would have taken the Under 21s seriously. But if any player needs a reminder, they only have to look as far as Juan Mata. He was part of the Spain squad that won the World Cup in 2010 in South Africa and then went back to the Under-21s the following summer and won the European Championship. Manchester United playmaker Juan Mata celebrates with the World Cup trophy in 2010 . Mata with his Bronze Boot award after helping Spain to the European Under 21 title in Denmark in 2011 . Scholes says that Calum Chambers (above) should not consider an Under 21s call-up a demotion . 'If it is good enough for Mata, why not English lads, too? Should Southgate’s team make it to the tournament, I would advocate taking Raheem Sterling and Jack Wilshere to the tournament next summer, even though they are well-established in the senior team.' Scholes highlights the counter-argument to his point; namely that dropping players who had played in qualifiers for those who haven't would be inherently unfair. But he retorts: 'Does the Football Association want to win something? If the answer is 'Yes', then it is time to be ruthless about getting the best team on the pitch.' Scholes played 66 times for England but never made an appearances for the Under 21s .","Paul Scholes says an England Under 21 call-up for a senior player such as Calum Chambers shouldn't be considered a demotion .

"Roma captain Francesco Totti all but accused Juventus of match-fixing after his side's 3-2 defeat in Turin on Sunday night. Juventus were awarded two dubious penalties, both converted by Carlos Tevez, as Roma's 100 per cent start to the Serie A season was ended. The 'Old Lady' were stripped of two Serie A titles and relegated to Serie B after the 2006 Calciopoli scandal embroiled them in match-fixing.

'Juventus ought to have their own league, as by hook or by crook they always win,' the 38-year-old told Sky Italia. 'Are we back to the same doubts? I am not the only one saying this, as these are things everyone in Italy should discuss. 'With Juventus when there is any doubt whatsoever, it’s always a penalty. I have to stop now, as if I keep talking then I’ll get suspended.' Totti scores from the penalty spot to make it 1-1 just after the half hour mark . The veteran Roma captain celebrates in front of the away fans after his equaliser . Juventus sporting director Giuseppe Marotta responded furiously to Totti's allegations. He said: 'I have great respect for Totti as a player. It’s understandable that he’s upset about the result but what he said was unacceptable. 'In the past Juve have had to bear the brunt for others' mistakes, but when the team has won it has won legitimately and deservingly from a footballing point of view. 'Every year Juventus are accused of being favoured in dubious or unclear situations, but I believe that these decisions even themselves out over the course of a season. 'When we won the penalty it reminded me of the Juventus v Roma match that was played at the Olimpico in Turin. That year Roma got the decision and this year it was our turn to get a penalty.'

"There's something quite remarkable happening down at Swindon this season. It's newsworthy enough that a team on a shoestring budget with a little-known manager and no household names are second in the League One table.

At 28, common wisdom has it that Andy Williams is in the prime of his career, yet the Swindon striker must feel like a veteran among Cooper's kids. His next-youngest team-mate is Jonathan Obika, 24. In fact, of the 24 players Cooper has used in all competitions this season, only three are above the age of 23. Cooper is best remembered for his ill-fated spell at Peterborough in the 2009-10 season. He won just one of 13 games in the Championship and was soon back in non-league, where he had made his name with Kettering, and seemingly on the managerial scrapheap. Fate gave the 45-year-old an unlikely second bite at the cherry in Football League management, albeit in a caretaker role, when Kevin McDonald resigned as Swindon manager in July 2013. Ex-Peterborough manager Mark Cooper has rebuilt his reputation at Swindon in the last 14 months . Nathan Thompson, defender, 23 . Versatile club captain already pushing 100 first-team appearances. Wes Foderingham, goalkeeper, 23 . Infamously subbed by Paolo di Canio after 21 minutes of a league game. Massimo Luongo, midfielder, 23 . Failed to make the grade at Tottenham. was in Australia's World Cup squad. Louis Thompson, midfielder, 19 . Younger brother of Nathan. Bought by Norwich in the summer and loaned back. Michael Smith, striker, 22 . Six goals in all competitions this season. Imposing figure at 6ft 4in. An impressive start to last season convinced the Swindon board to make Cooper's step up from assistant to manager permanent and their faith was justified with an eighth-placed finish last season. For a club walking a financial tightrope after 18 months of over-spending under Paolo di Canio that was quite an achievement, especially given the mass exodus of players that Cooper oversaw. But, although it may not have seemed that way when Cooper was given the job 14 months ago, there was a plan in place to secure Swindon's future by putting faith in a strong crop of academy players and loaning youngsters from Premier League clubs. They couldn't have imagined it would go this well though. Cooper has Swindon playing a possession-based game using the same 3-5-2 system we saw so often at the World Cup. Against Orient, they had 62 per cent of the ball. It's a joy to watch, or as Cooper said himself on Saturday: 'Some of the football was amazing. They're young players and they're getting better and better.' Captain Nathan Thompson looks to diffuse the situation as tempers flare at Brisbane Road . If last season exceeded expectations, then this campaign could well go down in footballing folklore if Swindon can maintain their form and win promotion. To repeat: the average age of Cooper's starting line-up is under 22. There are no veterans hiding away on the bench or in the reserves either. The average age of Cooper's 24-man squad? 21.1. There is much debate to be had over whether there are 'right' or 'wrong' ways to do things in football, but however you like your bread buttered, you can't help but admire what's going on at Swindon. Good week for... CARLISLE. The Cumbrians are off the foot of the League Two table after a 3-0 win at Hartlepool saw Keith Curle's side leapfrog their opponents. The relegation hangover may finally have gone after two wins on the spin. Bad week for... BOLTON. It seems the majority of Wanderers fans were glad to see the back of Dougie Freedman when he left the club last week. But Saturday's 2-1 defeat at home to Bournemouth shows there's no quick fix to Bolton's problems. Talent scout: Eoin Doyle (Chesterfield) Doyle's incredible goalscoring run continued on Saturday as he scored his 13th goal in 11 games as Chesterfield ran out 3-2 winners over Sheffield United in League One.

"Paul Scholes believes Raheem Sterling and Jack Wilshere should follow the lead of Juan Mata and play in next summer's European Under 21 Championship, should England qualify. Gareth Southgate's Young Lions take on Croatia in the first leg of their play-off at Molineux on Friday night and head into the match in fine form having won nine of their 10 group games. But former England and Manchester United midfielder Scholes writes in his Independent column that there needs to be a culture change if England are to succeed at Under 21 level. Jack Wilshere - man of the match against San Marino - will be eligible to play for the Under 21s next summer . Liverpool attacker Raheem Sterling should also go the European Under 21 Championship, says Paul Scholes . 'There are too many young players who, having made a senior debut, see a move to the Under 21s as a demotion,' Scholes argues. 'Calum Chambers is a prime example. He went from the Under 19s to the senior team. Then he was in the Under 21s squad this week until the injury to John Stones meant that he returned to the seniors. 'I have no reason to doubt that Chambers would have taken the Under 21s seriously. But if any player needs a reminder, they only have to look as far as Juan Mata. He was part of the Spain squad that won the World Cup in 2010 in South Africa and then went back to the Under-21s the following summer and won the European Championship. Manchester United playmaker Juan Mata celebrates with the World Cup trophy in 2010 . Mata with his Bronze Boot award after helping Spain to the European Under 21 title in Denmark in 2011 . Scholes says that Calum Chambers (above) should not consider an Under 21s call-up a demotion . 'If it is good enough for Mata, why not English lads, too? Should Southgate’s team make it to the tournament, I would advocate taking Raheem Sterling and Jack Wilshere to the tournament next summer, even though they are well-established in the senior team.' Scholes highlights the counter-argument to his point; namely that dropping players who had played in qualifiers for those who haven't would be inherently unfair. But he retorts: 'Does the Football Association want to win something? If the answer is 'Yes', then it is time to be ruthless about getting the best team on the pitch.' Scholes played 66 times for England but never made an appearances for the Under 21s .","Paul Scholes says an England Under 21 call-up for a senior player such as Calum Chambers shouldn't be considered a demotion .

"Wasps are expected to confirm on Tuesday that they have bought a majority share in the company that owns the Ricoh Arena, allowing them to move to Coventry on a permanent basis. According to the Daily Telegraph, the playing staff at the Aviva Premiership club have already been informed of a proposed move from Adams Park in time for the start of next season. It is hoped the move - expected to cost in the region of £30million - will secure the long-term future of Wasps, who were rescued from potential bankrputcy last year after a period of financial instability. Wasps are set to move into Coventry's Ricoh Arena (above) on a permanent basis from next season . Wasps full back Rob Miller (centre) is congratulated after his try against Newcastle last weekend . The Ricoh Arena, opened in 2006, is owned by Arena Coventry Limited, whose operating company is jointly owned by Coventry City Council and the the Alan Edward Higgs charity. The council will vote on whether to approve Wasps' proposed takeover at a meeting Tuesday. Coventry City Football Club recently started playing their matches at the Ricoh Arena again after they were forced to temporarily move to Northampton Town's Sixfields over a pay dispute.

Wasps are currently based at the home of Wycombe Wanderers Football Club, where they have been since 2002 after moving from Sudbury, Middlesex. The club have won the Heineken Cup twice as well as lifting four Premiership titles, but they have struggled to compete with England and Europe's elite in recent years due to their financial troubles.","Wasps expected to confirm permanent move to Coventry on Tuesday .

"Manchester United’s £16million signing of Marcos Rojo came amid pressure from outside influences for Sporting Lisbon to sell, according to their president Bruno de Carvalho. Due to third-party ownership laws in the United Kingdom, United had to also buy out Doyen Sports’ stake in the Argentina international defender when they agreed a fee with Sporting. The 24-year-old eventually made his United debut last month but De Carvalho insists Sporting never wanted Rojo to leave and that the move was instigated by Doyen. Marcos Rojo posted this picture on Instagram on Thursday ahead of Sunday's clash against Everton . Rojo joined Manchester United from Sporting Lisbon for £16million in August . Sporting chairman Bruno de Carvalho says he did not want the Argentine to leave the club . ‘We did not want Rojo to leave. He was an important player for us,’ he told the BBC World Football Show. ‘The pressure was so big, they [the third-party owners] started to speak to the clubs and come here to the meetings. ‘The directors thought they were people from the clubs because they were speaking in English although they were Portuguese. They believed it was a person from a club but it was a person from the funds.' De Carvalho insists that Sporting were under pressure from third-party owners to sell Rojo . Third-party ownership is banned in the UK and last week FIFA agreed to a worldwide ban, though it could take up to four years for that to fully come in to effect. A KPMG report last year revealed around a quarter of players in the Portuguese top flight had third-party owners.

"British and Irish Lions star Leigh Halfpenny could have his bumper Toulon contract ripped up before he has made an appearance for the European champions. The Wales full back became the latest superstar to join Mourad Boudjellal's revolution on French Riviera side when he left Cardiff Blues at the end of last season. But a groin injury picked up in pre-season has led the Toulon owner to threaten to terminate Halfpenny's contract. Leigh Halfpenny could have his bumper Toulon contract ripped up before he has made an appearance . Cardiff Blues are interested in re-signing Halfpenny should he leave big-spending Toulon . 'Today, we must address this issue because we need a world-class goalkicker. We're awaiting the medical update,' Boudjellal told Varmatin. 'He should be out for another two or three weeks. But the problem that we have now is that we think he may have arrived at Toulon with that injury. Now we have the impression that yes, he was injured when he signed for Toulon. 'If this is the case, we haven't ruled out terminating his contract. 'We pay enough for players (when they're away) for their national teams. We don't feel like preparing Halfpenny for the Rugby World Cup for Wales. 'We're conducting an investigation. I will know the whys and hows this week.' Blues chief executive Richard Holland confirmed the region's interest in Halfpenny should he become available. 'Cardiff Blues offered Leigh Halfpenny a contract prior to his departure to Toulon, and of course, we would be interested if he became available, be that on a dual contract or a regional deal,' Holland told Wales Online. 'We will be speaking to his representatives to find out the state of play regarding his contract situation and we will take things from there.

"Shinji Kagawa says he has ‘nothing to prove’ to English football fans as he gets ready to face Arsenal on Tuesday night. Kagawa rejoined Borussia Dortmund last month after two unsuccessful seasons at Manchester United. The 25-year-old attacking midfielder arrived at Old Trafford with a big reputation after helping Dortmund to two successive titles. Shinji Kagawa says he has ‘nothing to prove’ to English football fans as he gets ready to face Arsenal . The Japan international scored on his second Dortmund debut against Freiburg on Saturday . But Kagawa never cemented a first-team place and returned to Germany where he scored on his second Dortmund debut on Saturday. ‘I had a feeling when I left Dortmund that it would not be a door that was shut forever,’ Kagawa said. ‘I had a real ambition to play in England - but now I feel I am back where I belong. ‘Being back with Dortmund feels like being back with family - and as a player there is no better feeling than that. ‘I don’t feel like I have anything to prove to the fans in England - but I know that in England they did not see the best of me. ‘Already I am feeling that I am on the way back to the level I want to be. ‘It will take time - but I am finally on the right path.’ Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal had no qualms in allowing Kagawa to leave Old Trafford . Kagawa is set to start for Jurgen Klopp’s side as they welcome Arsenal to the Westfalenstadion. The Japanese knows Arsenal well from his time in England and he is wary of the trheat posed by Arsene Wenger’s side. ‘It is a big game against Arsenal,’ Kagawa added. ‘I know they are a very strong team - but it is important that we open our European campaign with a win. ‘We have some big players unavailable, but we also have a very strong squad - and feel we still have enough to beat Arsenal. ‘There is no feeling like playing Champions League football - and I am grateful Dortmund have given me the chance to play in this competition again. ‘I think over the last years Dortmund have shown they are not there just to make up the numbers - but to try and win it.’","Louis van Gaal allowed Shinji Kagawa to leave Manchester United .

"As is often the case with Football League clubs, MK Dons have only entered the headlines this season when they have been the support act to a Premier League story - namely their demolition of Manchester United in the Capital One Cup and Tottenham's proposed groundshare at stadium:mk. But back in the bread and butter of League One, Karl Robinson's side are quietly putting forward their strongest case yet for promotion to the Championship. Robinson, still only 34, has been at the club since 2010, making him the fifth-longest serving manager in the country. In that time the Liverpudlian has turned down several approaches from Championship clubs, and with his side's league finishes steadily worsening in those four seasons - coming fifth, fifth, eighth and tenth consecutively - it looked as though he may have missed the boat to manage at a higher level. MK Dons manager Karl Robinson looks delighted after his side's 5-3 win at Barnsley on Saturday . Benik Afobe (hidden) is mobbed by his team-mates after scoring the opening goal at Oakwell . stadium:mk has been expanded to a 30,500 capacity with Tottenham eyeing a ground share . But Saturday's emphatic 5-3 win at Barnsley - their fourth victory in six league games this season - has cemented MK Dons' place firmly in the running for automatic promotion. If Robinson's side are promoted it will be a vindication of a patient approach to football they have shown both on and off the pitch over the last four years. Much like Arsene Wenger at Arsenal, Robinson has sat tight while his board have got their house in order - expanding stadium:mk's capacity to 30,500 and selling prized academy products such as Sam Baldock, Sheyi Ojo and Brendan Galloway to balance the books. Even with those departures, now fewer than eight players who came through the ranks at the club were named in Robinson's matchday squad of 18 on Saturday. On the pitch, Robinson is very much and advocate of a patient, possession-based game, as his side showed in their classy dismantling of United last month. In addition, Robinson - who has had John Gorman, Ian Wright, Alan Smith and Mick Harford on his coaching staff before - looks to have made an astute move in bringing in former Portsmouth, Crawley and Bury manager Richie Barker as his first-team coach. Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal looks dejected after losing 4-0 at stadium:mk last month . Arsenal loanee Afobe celebrates scoring one of his two goals against United . Saturday's result means MK Dons are now League One's highest goalscorers with 14 goals in six games. While Benik Afobe - whose loan from Arsenal is a compliment to Robinson by Wenger in itself - and Will Grigg have been putting the goals away, it is the midfield dominance asserted by teen sensation Dele Alli alongside the likes of Mark Randall, Ben Reeves, Darren Potter and Samir Carruthers that best encapsulates Robinson's philosophy. Robinson has smartly fed off the scraps of Premier League academies to build a young, hungry side. Where Randall (Arsenal), Reeves (Southampton), Potter (Liverpool), Carruthers (Aston Villa) and defender Jordan Spence (West Ham) lacked opportunities in the top flight, they have found a new lease of life in League One. Of course, there is a sub-plot with MK Dons. They are one of the most disliked clubs in the land due to their 'theft' of Wimbledon's history and league status, but that was nothing to do with Robinson and his squad, and they are doing all they can to build bridges with their stylish play. Goalkeeper David Martin and chairman Pete Winkelman celebrate after the win over United . All three sides relegated from Championship in May find themselves in the bottom half of the League One table at this early stage of the season. That presents a great opportunity for the likes of MK Dons, Bristol City and Peterborough to win promotion, and that trio already look like they will take some catching. Forget Spurs, there may be another side in white filling out stadium:mk in the upper echelons of English football before too long. Good week for ... BURTON ALBION. Just seven games into the League Two season and Gary Rowett's side have already opened up a five-point cushion to the play-off places following Saturday's 2-0 win over York. Rowett, a former Premier League defender with Leicester and Charlton, has coached his side to five clean sheets already this season and will be looking for a sixth when Burton travel to Wimbledon on Tuesday night. Burton Albion celebrate John Mousinho's goal on their way to another win in League Two over York . Bad week for ... LEYTON ORIENT. The east London club headed into the season full of optimism, with a new owner prepared to splash the cash and a squad that - on paper at least - looks better than last season's group, who finished third and lost the play-off final at Wembley. But Saturday's 2-0 home defeat by lowly Colchester has left Russell Slade admitting he has been told he is just one game from the sack. That game comes on Tuesday night at Notts County. Talent scout: Teddy Bishop (Ipswich) Ipswich have a proud record of bringing through youngsters and midfielder Bishop is the latest academy product to have established himself in Mick McCarthy's squad.

"As managers up and down the land were frantically trying to make final adjustments to their squads on deadline day, Wolves boss Kenny Jackett could afford to put his feet up. Heading into the international break, Jackett’s side sit third in the SkyBet Championship having won four of their first five games back in second tier. Inheriting a club in total disarray last summer, Jackett has shown himself to be an expert in squad building. Means business: Kenny Jackett has revamped a Wolves since taking over at Molinuex . In little over a year in the Black Country, he has transformed a playing squad with no coherence, direction or belief into a well-drilled machine that looks capable of back-to-back promotions. Jackett has overseen a clearout of massive proportions, with 15 players leaving Wolves since he joined. In his own methodical and calm way, he has rejuvenated the club, giving it a clear identity and direction in building his side around a first-rate academy that was criminally ignored by predecessors Stale Solbakken, Dean Saunders and, to a lesser extent, Mick McCarthy. Jackett has fielded the same starting XI in each of Wolves’ five league games so far this season. Of that side, David Edwards is the oldest player at just 28, while three academy products - goalkeeper Carl Ikeme, centre back Danny Batth and full back Matt Doherty - have been key, with a further three home-grown Wanderers on the bench. Chief executive Jez Moxey and owner Steve Morgan have invested total faith in the former Millwall manager to turn their club around (in fairness, they gave the same backing to Solbakken and Co, just this time the manager knew what he was doing). All smiles: Wolves sit third in the Championship after winning four of their opening five fixtures . There are still five more players on the transfer list and training away from the first-team in the shape of defenders Roger Johnson, Kevin Foley and Georg Margreitter, winger Razak Boukari and striker Kevin Doyle, though Jackett has not let that disrupt his building of what is now very much his team. The signings along the way have been in keeping with his vision of a young, hungry group of players. This summer, Dutch winger Raymond van la Parra, midfielder George Saville and versatile former Peterborough captain Tommy Rowe have enhanced a squad stregnthened last season with the additions of the likes of Kevin McDonald, Nouha Dicko, Michael Jacobs and James Henry. What is has left Wolves with - excluding the exiled five - is a squad of 26 which includes no fewer than 13 academy graduates, with a further two in Zeli Ismail and Jake Cassidy impressing out on loan in League One with Notts County. Another out on loan is talented teenage centre back Kortney Hause, signed this summer from Wycombe. Shrewd move: Wanderers landed Peterborough United skipper Tommy Rowe in the summer . Remarkably, captain Sam Ricketts is the only player in Jackett’s squad over the age of 30, while there are only four over the age of 27. Jackett has not backed youth for youth’s sake, just as he hasn’t sold for the sake of it either. Bakary Sako, for example, fitted in to the bracket of high-earners signed by Solbakken, yet Jackett recognised the brilliant talent he had on his hands and has moulded Wolves’ attacking structure around the French winger. Sako is probably the best wide man outside the top flight and has been rewarded for his loyalty - as may Wolves fans be come May. With no standout side coming down from the Premier League, the promotion race looks set to be wide open and there is no reason why Wolves can’t emulate the recent achievements of Southampton and Norwich in earning back-to-back promotions. Good week for ... PETERBOROUGH. Having lost top scorer Britt Assombalonga and captain Tommy Rowe over the summer, Posh looked like they could struggle to make the top six in League One heading into the start of the season. But following Saturday’s 3-1 win at Colchester, Darren Ferguson’s side sit top of the third-tier tree. Peterborough had a similarly strong start last season, however, and can’t afford to fall away like they did if they are to win promotion. Missing? Peterborough lost striker Britt Assombalonga to Nottingham Forest but are still scoring goals . Bad week for ... CARLISLE. Time has run out for Graham Kavanagh following Saturday’s 5-0 defeat by Cambridge. After an up-turn in fortunes following Kavanagh’s appointment in September last year, it has been a miserable 2014 for the Cumbrians. Despite boasting one of the strongest squads in League Two they are yet to win this season and an immediate return to the third tier already looks like wishful thinking. That's your lot! Graham Kavanagh was sacked as manager of Carlisle United on Monday morning . Talent scout: Cameron Lancaster (Stevenage) Did he mean it? Probably not, but Lancaster’s debut goal for Stevenage following his release by Tottenham was one to savour. The 21-year-old forward earned three points for Graham Westley’s side with a curling 40-yard effort from the touchline to seal a 3-2 win at AFC Wimbledon. Lancaster’s career has stalled badly since making his Spurs debut in the Premier League in January 2012 but with time on his side and first-team opportunities available in League Two, he can add plenty more to his goal tally.

"It is perhaps a sad indictment of the English game that no Premier League side came in for Britt Assombalonga this summer, but their loss is very much Nottingham Forest’s gain. The £5.5million Forest’s Kuwaiti owners forked out to sign a 21-year-old striker who had never scored above League One level was a risk clearly no top flight side was prepared to take. But in his three appearances so far for Stuart Pearce’s outfit, Assombalonga is already looking like a Premier League striker, let alone a Championship one. Prolific: Assambalonga has scored three goals in his last two games for new side Nottingham Forest . Worth the risk: No Premier League club came in for Assombalonga despite his impressive goalscoring record . From a tap-in to a long-range effort, left foot, right foot or header, the ex-Peterborough and Watford man is capable of any type of finish, as he showed on his way to scoring 33 goals in all competitions for Posh last season. He has three already this campaign. The English transfer market is an inflated one, of that there is no doubt, but when put into the context of Ross McCormack’s £11.5m move to Fulham, Assombalonga looks a relative snip. It is, however, easy to see why Wigan manager Uwe Rosler felt the need to bemoan the Championship transfer market after his side’s 1-0 defeat by Cardiff - no slouches themselves when it comes to opening the coffers - on Tuesday night. ‘The transfer market is destroyed this year, in terms of the money that has been paid for certain positions,’ he told BBC Radio Manchester. ‘We have a strong team but where we lack is up front so we need to strengthen in that area. It’s not easy, especially when you’re driving a football club in a responsible way like we do.’ Assombalonga is not alone in learning his trade outside the top flight due to a lack of willingness from Premier League clubs to sign young, home-grown strikers. Jordan Rhodes cost Blackburn £8million two years ago and has proved to be worth that outlay with a prolific goal return, yet he is still in the Championship. Rhodes’ Scotland international team-mate, Derby’s Chris Martin, as well as Bournemouth’s Callum Wilson and Norwich’s Lewis Grabban are all of an ability that would see them playing top flight football by this stage of their careers in any other era. Expensive: Ross McCormack's £11m move to Fulham is a risky one . VIDEO McCormack completed Fulham move . Highly-rated: Jordan Rhodes has proved to be a quality striker in the Championship . What the current climate does do though is make the Championship increasingly relevant for the English national team. With a dearth of English strikers currently playing regularly in the top flight, Roy Hodgson may well look to the second tier and specifically Assombalonga to add firepower to his ranks. But he needs to hurry, earlier this month Assombalonga, who moved to England aged eight months, was put on the provisional list for DR Congo’s 2015 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying campaign. The Congo-born striker has not yet declared his international allegiance but is still eligible for England’s Under 21 side. ‘Having those two options does give you a bit of relief,’ Assombalonga told Sportsmail last year. ‘If you have got parents from different countries then you do wonder who you should play for.’ One thing is for sure though, regardless of his international future, if Assombalonga can keep up his goalscoring record he will find himself in the Premier League before too long. Forest sit top of the Championship tree following Tuesday night’s 2-1 win at Bournemouth and on the evidence of the first three games of the season they look to have the best striker in the division too. Cod Army flying high . Fleetwood Town maintained their 100 per cent start to the season in League One with a 2-0 win at Scunthorpe on Tuesday night. Graham Alexander’s side, who were promoted in May via the play-offs, have conceded just once in their opening three games and already look like contenders for back-to-back promotions. Top dog: Graham Alexander has done a superb job at Fleetwood Town since taking over in 2012 . The only other two sides in the Football League with a perfect record so far are Morecambe and Burton Albion in League Two. Morecambe’s 1-0 win over Oxford United on Tuesday night consigned the Us to a third consecutive defeat and they already find themselves nine points adrift of Jim Bentley’s side despite the polarised pre-season predictions for both clubs. Talent scout: Jed Wallace (Portsmouth) Portsmouth are living up to their billing a pre-season favourites for promotion from League Two after collecting seven points from their opening three games, and Wallace has played a key role so far. The attacking midfielder only turned 20 in March but has already scored 15 goals in 75 appearances for Pompey, including two in their first three league games of the season. A goal from the former England Under 19 international and one from Craig Westcarr were enough to see of Northampton Town on Tuesday night.

"The third tier has housed a clutch of former Premier League sides in recent seasons including a couple of English football's heavyweights, with Leeds, Wolves, Southampton, Sheffields United and Wednesday, Leicester, Norwich and Charlton all dipping their toes in League One waters. Only three of those - Norwich, Leicester and, last season, Wolves - were promoted back to the Championship at the first time of asking, with Leeds spending three years in the third tier. This season, Sheffield United go one better, or worse, than Leeds as they embark on their fourth successive season in League One, and it is a stay they will be quadruply determined to end. Rebuilding: Nigel Clough has overhauled the Sheffield United squad since taking over in late October . Returning to League One after just one season in the Championship are Doncaster and Yeovil, while Barnsley's eight-year stay in the second tier came to an end in May. Coming up from League Two are three familiar faces to this level in Chesterfield, Scunthorpe and Rochdale, and one not so familiar one in Fleetwood, who start only their third season in the Football League. Intriguingly, no club in the division has changed their manager this summer - though that statistic is bound not to last very long once the new season kicks off. Here, Sportsmail previews the League One season ahead of the opening fixtures... The favourites . If Sheffield United replicate the form they showed in the second half of the last campaign they will surely be in the automatic promotion places. Nigel Clough has reshaped the Blades squad to give it a younger feel and despite losing star man Harry Maguire to Hull this summer they have clearly improved on the whole. Case for the defence: Maguire only turned 21 in March but made 166 appearances for the Blades . Similarly, Leyton Orient have lost a key player in winger Moses Odubajo to Brentford but look a better unit. Orient just missed out on automatic promotion last season and look well set for another push for the top two after signing several players proven at Championship level. The 85 points fifth-placed Preston had racked up last season would have been enough to win League One the campaign before. While he has not made any eye-catching signings, manager Simon Grayson has managed to cling on to his key men and Preston are therefore again likely to challenge for automatic. Bristol City flirted with a second successive relegation last season but had a revival once Steve Cotterill took charge in December. They have also strengthened and if they can keep hold of their strikeforce of Jay Emmanuel-Thomas and 23-goal Sam Baldock they will be in the automatic promotion hunt. Top of the charts: Baldock scored more goals than anyone else in League One last season . Doncaster are lacking strength in depth at the moment but their starting XI is as good as any at this level and with a few additions they will be ready to challenge for an immediate and automatic return to the Championship. Dark horses . The relegated duo of Barnsley and Yeovil have rebuilt sufficiently over the summer to render them both promotion contenders but neither have the personnel nor the resources to have aspirations of dominating the division as Wolves did last season. They will both, nonetheless, be targeting promotion, but may have to settle for the play-off route. Peterborough flew out of the blocks last season before falling away badly and eventually being beaten in the play-off semi-finals by Orient. Automatic promotion looks a bridge too far again for Darren Ferguson's side but if they can reinvest some of the £5m paid by Nottingham Forest for star striker Britt Assombalonga they should be assured another top-six finish. Britt of all right: Peterborough striker Assombalonga (middle) has moved to Nottingham Forest for £5m . MK Dons finished in the top six in 2011 and 2012 but have missed out in the last two seasons after selling many of their prizes assets. But Karl Robinson has been able to improve his squad over the summer for the first time in years and they look in a position to challenge again. Fleetwood's financial clout has seen them improve what was already a very strong squad after their League Two play-off final win over Burton and a third promotion in four years is not entirely out of the question. Coventry, free from the 10-point deduction that hampered them last season, will have one eye on the top six despite losing top scorer Callum Wilson to Bournemouth. Relegation battle . League One is the most treacherous division in the Football League by virtue of the fact that four go down rather than three in the Championship and two in League Two. That being said, Notts County, who survived on the final day of last season, would have been relegated in League Two with their 50-point tally. The Magpies won six of their last nine games under Shaun Derry last season and should survive more comfortably this time around with a mix of youth and experience added to the squad. Great escape: Shaun Derry (left) with his new player-coach and former England international Alan Smith . Conversely, fellow strugglers from last season Crewe look to have gone backwards over the summer and their fans will be fearing the drop unless they can unearth another gem or two from their academy - which history proves is not entirely out of the question. Scunthorpe and Rochdale - promoted automatically from League Two in May - have both lost vital goals with Sam Winnall and Scott Hogan moving to Barnsley and Brentford respectively. They could be joined in a relegation fight with League Two champions Chesterfield, who have been frustrated in the transfer market so far. Elsewhere, Walsall and Crawley have been hit hard by summer departures and look set for a relegation battle along with perennial strugglers Colchester and Oldham.

"By its very nature as the lowest professional division in the country, the goings on in League Two are all too often an afterthought in the frantic world of English football. But at the bottom of the Football League you will find the very essence of our game. League Two in the past housed seasoned veterans and long-ball football, but now it is the home of some of the best young talent in the country, forced to try and forge a career from the bottom up due to the influx of foreign talent in the top flight. Clubs like Hartlepool United, Plymouth Argyle and Exeter City have set a new and encouraging trend of focusing on development rather than recruitment. The only way is up: Fleetwood Town celebrate after winning the League Two play-off final in May . What the FA implore the big clubs to do is already being done in League Two. Twelve of Exeter's squad of 20 have come through their academy, eight of Hartlepool's squad of 19, and seven of Plymouth's squad of 22. Refreshingly too, financial gulfs are nowhere near as wide in League Two than they are higher up the pyramid, creating a level playing field and a truly unpredictable league. Bristol Rovers were surprisingly relegated last season alongside Torquay, while the quartet of Carlisle, Tranmere, Shrewsbury and Stevenage who have come down from League One will find no easy games. On the flip side, Luton and Cambridge, promoted from the Conference, can take solace in the fact that no side has gone straight back down from the Conference since its inception. A remarkable statistic. So you get the picture then - what League . Two lacks in prestige it makes up for in its fluid, combustible and . refreshingly English nature. Champagne moment: Luton Town captain Ronnie Henry lifts the Skrill Conference title . Squad overhauls are far more commonplace, with the vast majority of transfers being signed for free on one-year deals - Shrewsbury have been the busiest of the lot so far, with 16 players coming in. That being said, managerial changes are less frequent in League Two than in the leagues above. Only three clubs changed managers in the summer, with Michael Appleton coming in at Oxford, Rob Edwards at Tranmere and Micky Mellon at Shrewsbury. League Two also houses the second-longest serving manager in the country. Paul Tisdale's eight years at Exeter is bettered only by Arsene Wenger's near-18-year stay at Arsenal. Tisdale and the rest of the league will be back in action this weekend when the season kicks off at 3pm on Saturday. Here, Sportsmail previews the battles to win promotion and to stay in the Football League... High profile: Former Premier League winger Liam Lawrence has joined Shrewsbury Town . The favourites . Bury and Portsmouth finished last season strongly after changing managers and, having both recruited well, look capable of automatic promotion. Bury boss David Flitcroft managed to persuade prolific veteran striker Ryan Lowe to come back to Gigg Lane, while goalkeeper Shwan Jalal, midfielder Tom Soares and winger Kelvin Etuhu have impressed at higher levels in past seasons. Andy Awford was given the Portsmouth job full-time at the end of last season after remaining unbeaten during his caretaker spell, when Pompey won five of their final seven games to avoid relegation. That has given the former Pompey captain a mandate to manouevre in the transfer market and he has added the experience of goalkeeper Paul Jones, left back Nicky Shorey and Danny Hollands to a squad full of young talent from their academy. New arrival: Former England international left back Nicky Shorey (right) is now at Portsmouth . Oxford could also be in the automatic promotion shake-up, with a hungry Michael Appleton eager to prove his managerial credentials after a frustrating start to his career. Appleton's first three jobs were all in difficult environments at Portsmouth, Blackpool and Blackburn, so he will appreciate being in relatively serene surroundings, even though he has had to drop into the fourth tier. All four relegated sides will be expecting promotion challenges, but that may be a bridge too far for a Stevenage side who have been going backwards for the entirety of Graham Westley's third spell in charge. Like Stevenage, Carlisle stuck with their manager despite relegation. Graham Kavanagh will be under immediate pressure to challenge at the top, but he has the squad to do so. Bossing it: New Oxford manager Michael Appleton (left) and his Accrington counterpart James Beattie . Likewise, Tranmere have not been weakened too much by relegation and have a side that hould be in the automatic promotion race right to the end. Shrewsbury's reaction to relegation was in stark contrast to that of their rivals, with a new manager and 16 players coming in. Micky Mellon needs to get his squad gelled quickly, but he will be hungry for success in League Two having been harshly sacked by Fleetwood shortly after leading them to the Football League two years ago. The signing of former Stoke and Sunderland wideman Liam Lawrence could prove to be an inspired piece of business by Mellon and Shrewsbury. Dark horses . Such is the nature of League Two, all 24 sides know that promotion is not beyond their reach, even if they are not expecting it or planning for it. Burton Albion were the losing play-off finalists in May, and while their squad will have been hit hard by that defeat it has been strengthened over the summer. They have a top young manager in Gary Rowett who will be confident of a third successive top-seven finish. Pointing the way: Southend goalkeeper Daniel Bentley will hope to be part of another top-seven finish . As a big-name club for this level, Luton's odds for promotion are artificially short, but back-to-back promotions from the Conference to League One have been achieved in recent history by Crawley and Stevenage. The loss of striker Andre Gray to Brentford will be hard-felt though and they may take a mid-table finish. York and Southend, losing play-off semi-finalists in May, will in the hunt for the top seven again and could be challenged by a cluster of improving sides from last season's also-rans, such as Wimbledon, Hartlepool, Exeter and Plymouth. Relegation battle . The stats prove that this is traditionally the tightest relegation scrap in all four of England's professional leagues. With little to choose between all 24 clubs in terms of financial clout, and with the fact that only two teams go down, there often arises a scenario like last season, when Bristol Rovers were relegated on the last day despite being just nine points adrift the top half of the table. Promising: Burton manager Gary Rowett (right) chats to Derby's Steve McClaren before a friendly . The team that escaped that day, Wycombe, could well find themselves in another relegation battle after a difficult summer in the transfer market for manager Gareth Ainsworth. Cambridge have a very inexperienced side and unless they address that they could become the first side to be relegated back to the Conference the season after promotion. If Cambridge and Wycombe are to stay up they will be looking to finish above the likes of Morecambe and Newport, who finished last season poorly. Bury 6/4, Portsmouth 13/8, Luton 15/8, Shrewsbury 11/5, Northampton 7/2, Burton Albion 7/2, Plymouth 4/1, York 4/1, Carlisle 9/2, Southend 9/2, Stevenage 9/2, AFC Wimbledon 11/2, Oxford Utd 11/2, Newport 6/1, Tranmere 6/1, Cambridge 7/1, Cheltenham 8/1, Hartlepool 8/1, Mansfield 8/1, Dag & Red 9/1, Accrington Stanley 11/1, Morecambe 14/1, Wycombe 14/1, Exeter 18/1 .","League Two season kicks off with 12 fixtures on Saturday, August 9 at 3pm .

"Roy Keane has revealed his dismay at hearing Abba’s hit record Dancing Queen played in the Sunderland dressing room just before the players headed out for a match. Keane makes the claim in his new autobiography, The Second Half, saying he feared it showed he lacked leaders in his team. And he also explains why he was so disappointed to hear the Swedish quartet’s 1976 hit being played before a match. VIDEO Scroll down to watch  Somethin' Stupid parody of Keane and O'Neill . Roy Keane was shocked when none of his players objected to Abba (right) as a pre-match music choice . ‘It might seem strange but you find out about characters when you look to see who’s in charge of the music,' he said. ‘A young lad might want to put on the latest sound; an older player might say, “I’m the senior player” and put himself in charge. ‘But I noticed none of the players (at Sunderland) were in charge of the music and this was a concern for me. A member of staff was in charge. ‘I was looking at him thinking, “I hope someone nails him here.” The last song before the players went on to the pitch was Dancing Queen by Abba. Keane worried about a lack of leaders in his Sunderland team after the Abba incident . ‘What really worried me was that none of the players – not one – said, ‘Get that s*** off.’ ‘They were going out to play a match, men versus men, testosterone levels were high. You’ve got to hit people at pace. F****’ Dancing Queen. ‘It worried me.

"England head coach Stuart Lancaster has settled on 80 per cent of his World Cup squad, but refuses to dismiss Sam Burgess' prospects of inclusion. Burgess' union debut for Bath has been delayed until December at the earliest after he broke his cheekbone in the NRL Grand Final just over a week ago. The powerful 25-year-old has told Lancaster he has targeted a spot in his 31-man squad for England 2015, the majority of which the head coach insists has already been inked in. Sam Burgess has been an rugby league star, and hopes his code switch will ready him for the union World Cup . Stuart Lancaster will name his latest England squad for the autumn internationals on Wednesday . Kyle Eastmond, Luther Burrell, Billy Twelvetrees and Brad Barritt are contenders at inside centre, the position earmarked for the opening phase of Burgess' transition from league. Lancaster also identifies Owen Farrell as a possibility at 12, enabling the in-form George Ford to be accommodated at fly-half, and warns Burgess that the competition for places is fierce. When asked if there is enough time for Burgess to force his way into his World Cup plans, Lancaster told Sky Sports News: 'I guess we'll see. It will be fascinating to see how he goes. 'The break is probably a good thing for Sam, it'll give him a break that he probably needs. 'He can get across here and can learn the game in a quieter environment rather than being thrown straight into the spotlight. 'Having spoken to him, his mind-set obviously is to make the World Cup squad. 'We have some very good centres who I'm sure will have something to say about that and he will have to learn the game quickly, but he's mentally strong. 'If he can learn the game he will bring an invaluable amount to the group. Sam Burgess fractured his cheekbone and eye socket playing his last match for the South Sydney Rabbitohs . Sam Burgess (left) lifts the NRL trophy after leading his Rabbitohs side to victory in the Grand Final . 'Obviously he has got to learn the game first, but he is a very, very good player and an impressive person. 'What stands out for me is his mental toughness and strength, the desire to dominate his opposite number. 'He's played against some huge stars in rugby league, he's taken the decision to go out to Australia at 18 years old because he wants to test himself and that's a big thing to do. 'He's done that, he's achieved it and now he sees another challenge in front of him and you've got to admire someone who has that sense of mental strength.' Lancaster names his elite player squad for the autumn Tests on Wednesday week with the visit of New Zealand to Twickenham on November 8 launching the series. The position provoking most debates is inside centre with Eastmond's dazzling start to the season at Bath identifying him as the Aviva Premiership's form player. Counting against Eastmond is his struggle against the All Blacks in the third Test in Hamilton in June with his defensive shortcomings resulting in his half-time substitution. 'Kyle is rather good and he has really developed this season,' Lancaster said. 'He had a great first Test against New Zealand and then things didn't go for us as a backline in the third Test. Kyle Eastmond in action for Bath against Wasps at Adams Park on Sunday afternoon . Kyle Eastmond of Bath in skips away from Wasps prop Matt Mullan in the Aviva Premiership . 'I had a good chat with him afterwards and he had a steely determination in his mind. I could see him at that point saying ""right, I'll be back next season and I'll be ready"". 'He said the same thing to Bath and he's been outstanding for Bath this season, so he's really putting a marker down for the November internationals.' England were whitewashed 3-0 by New Zealand and have yet to win any silverware under Lancaster, who has presided to successive runners-up finishes in the RBS 6 Nations. 'We'd like to have won something and it is really frustrating for all of us that we haven't achieved that,' Lancaster said. 'But sometimes going through the pain of losing channels your motivation. 'No one would choose losing as an option, but for us as a group, the pain of losing certainly drives us.'","League convert Sam Burgess is targeting England's World Cup squad .

"Luther Burrell ran in the only try as Northampton crept back to the summit of the Aviva Premiership after labouring to victory over London Irish at the Madejski Stadium. Just hours after Bath had underlined their title credentials with an empathic victory over Saracens, Saints toiled to their fourth win of the season. England centre Burrell's 36th-minute try was the solitary touch down of a drab spectacle short on highlights. Luther Burrell ran in the only try as Northampton crept back to the summit of the Aviva Premiership . Burrell showed strength to breach the whitewash, but it was an otherwise disappointing afternoon notable for some poor handling that will not have strengthened his claims to selection in this autumn's QBE Internationals. Fly-half Stephen Myler finished with a 14-point haul made up of four penalties and a conversion. Northampton led 10-0 at half-time but resurgent Irish hit back through the kicking of Shane Geraghty, who finished with four penalties, to secure a deserved losing bonus point. Samu Manoa showed his power with a muscular early run through the heart of the Exiles' defence, but when Saints sought to exploit an overlap Burrell flung out a poor pass. Northampton, who were missing injured England forwards Tom Wood and Dylan Hartley to injury, turned the screw at the scrum before Myler landed his first penalty. Shane Geraghty finished the game with four penalties to secure a deserved losing point for London Irish . A scruffy quarter continued with Geraghty missing a simple three points and the former England fly-half was flattened by Courtney Lawes shortly after. Ken Pisi's thunderous midfield hit enabled the champions to turn defence into attack, but the Exiles recovered quickly and the deadlock continued. Once again Northampton began pounding at the Irish 22 and once again they were let down by their handling with Burrell culpable. But the England centre then made amends, showing his strength to slide over and touch down after the speed of a Saints counter-attack that began with a loose kick outwitted the Exiles. Northampton's James Craig beats his London Irish rival to take a catch at the lineout . Myler, Ken Pisi and George North were involved before Burrell chose to go it alone with Lawes outside him and he had the tenacity to stampede over Geraghty and ride a despairing tackle from Tomas O'Leary. The third quarter was dominated by a kicking duel from the tee between Geraghty and Myler as a poor match continued to disappoint. North and Andrew Fenby collided, but the Irish full-back came up with the ball after plucking a superb catch from the air. The third quarter was dominated by a kicking duel from the tee between Geraghty and Myler . There appeared to be little chance of a second try being added to Burrell's touch down with a fourth Geraghty penalty keeping the scoreboard ticking over. Irish continued to snap at the heals of Northampton, although their cause was not helped when Geraghty failed with a simple drop-goal and long-range penalty. At last the game opened up with Burrell almost forcing his way over for a second time before his poor pass butchered a chance for Ben Foden. Fittingly, the final act of the afternoon was a penalty from Myler.","Northampton beat London Irish 19-12 .

Owen Farrell is clear favourite to pull the strings at next year's World Cup, but the Saracen is currently struggling with a thigh strain and has also been hampered by a knee injury this year. Snapping at his heals are George Ford, Freddie Burns, Danny Cipriani and Myler, who believes the chance to add to his solitary cap will enable him to press his own claim. 'I'm craving the opportunity. Once you get that opportunity it's up to you, but that's all I want,' Myler said. 'I'm not sure what's going on in the minds of the selectors, but I'm just playing the best rugby I can for my club.There are a few players who have been doing well in my position.

You wouldn't say that his main attribute, but he can move for a big man, so it's nice having him in the team.'","Owen Farrell is England's No fly-half but is struggling with a thigh injury .

"Premiership Rugby chief executive Mark McCafferty rejects the argument that increasing the salary cap will create an uneven playing field. Aviva Premiership clubs will be able to spend up to £5.5million on their wage bill for the 2015-16 season, a £500,000 rise on the current figure. It has also been agreed that they can sign a second marquee player whose salary falls outside the cap. Harlequins director of rugby Conor O'Shea insist that clubs may to ratify a second salary cap . Sir Ian McGeechan is among those who have voiced concerns that the increase will create a two-tier Premiership. McCafferty stresses that while inequality will always exist, all clubs will be able to compete because of the way revenue is allocated. ""The salary cap is linked as a percentage to the money we distribute centrally from TV rights and the big sponsorship deals,"" said McCafferty, who was speaking at the Nolan Partners Sport Industry Breakfast Club. ""It's geared in such a way that as the business grows, so too does the salary cap. ""Because the business is growing, more money is being distributed to the clubs and they get an equal share of that. ""The only difference then is the scale of a club's business. If you have bigger revenue from bigger attendance, then you'll be in a slightly more advantageous position. ""But it was ever thus, you can't level the playing field in everything. ""In fact we believe it is the reverse of an unlevel playing field - the extra money will allow the clubs to continue developing, particularly their academies."" McCafferty added that the future introduction of a third marquee player is unlikely. Premiership Rugby is confident that the off-field support offered to players will prevent large numbers departing for France after next year's World Cup. England's Steffon Armitage was forced into moving to France to chase the money at Toulon . England have a policy of only picking stars based overseas in 'exceptional circumstances', so persuading them to turn down lucrative offers from the Top 14 is in the interests of club and country. While the financial rewards in France are great, club budgets are spent on recruitment and wages at the expense of medical support and development. Ireland fly-half Jonathan Sexton is to rejoin Leinster when his two-year contract at Racing Metro expires at the end of the season, while the Welsh exodus has produced mixed fortunes. ""It's not a big worry, we just want to make sure we're in the best possible position to make sure we retain the talent we have,"" McCafferty said. ""The salary cap is one aspect that helps us do that, but there's also the player welfare stuff we do off the field such as post career development. ""For most players it's a package, not just what they're paid. ""A lot of players who have been to France, which is the natural market, have come back with some pretty poor experiences off the pitch. ""Wales have made a few comments about a few of their players currently playing in France who aren't coming back into international camp in the best condition. ""The players are aware of these and for some of them it makes sense to move, for others it doesn't. Hopefully those who don't are in the majority.""","Mark McCafferty says everyone will still be able to compete with salary cap .

The two-times European champions have acquired a 50 per cent interest in the Ricoh Arena after Coventry City Council voted in favour of selling their controlling interest in Arena Coventry Limited (ACL). Wasps will continue to play at their existing ground at Adams Park, which is shared with Wycombe Wanderers, until December. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sharks v Wasps highlights . Wasps will stage their first game at their new home in Coventry against Castres or London Irish in December . Wasps play Castres in the European Rugby Champions Cup on both December 5 and 12, with the home and away tie yet to be decided, and will face London Irish on December 21 in the Aviva Premiership. The decision to move the club to Coventry has angered supporters, but chief executive Nick Eastwood insists it was taken in the best interests of the club. 'This is a watershed moment in the history of Wasps and the professional game,' Eastwood said. 'It will help us realise our ambition to re-establish ourselves as one of the best teams in Europe and will guarantee the long-term success of the club. 'We fully appreciate this move will unsettle many of our supporters and I would like to stress that this decision has not been taken lightly.'

Wasps willmove home games from Adams Park, home of Wycombe Wanderers, to Coventry . 'It’s always dangerous to try and project what other people feel, but it’s obviously a massive change and people are very sceptical of change, it’s human nature,' Haskell said. 'But look at the situation we were in - we were an hour away from going bankrupt. We were losing £3million per year for a long period of time. '(Owner) Derek Richardson came in and absorbed £10million worth of debt. 'Our deal at Adams Park meant that for every £1 spent we got 50p. There was no other option than to move. 'I’ve been a Wasps fan since the age of 12 and am their longest serving player. 'I have intimate knowledge of where this club has been and how close we were to disappearing. 'Players should be solely focused on the rugby and on performance, but at Wasps at times it’s been ‘are we getting paid and where are we living?’. As of now that’s changed. 'It’s difficult to explain that business side of it to a young fan because of the emotion involved, but Coventry isn’t a million miles away. 'This stadium, facility and the matchday experience - the whole set up will only make the club better.

"James Haskell has targeted Chris Robshaw's England place after welcoming the chance to play his way into Stuart Lancaster's autumn plans. An agreement has been reached with the Aviva Premiership clubs for Lancaster to delay naming his squad for the QBE Series against New Zealand, South Africa, Samoa and Australia until October 22. Moved from its original date in July, the change enables England's head coach to select players on form while offering a series of intriguing sub-plots to the early rounds of league combat. James Haskell has targeted Chris Robshaw's England place ahead of the autumn fixtures . Robshaw has been involved in two early season duels with Will Fraser of Saracens and Haskell himself, who performed well in Wasps' defeat at Harlequins on Saturday. 'I'm good friends with Chris, I've known him for years and I have the utmost respect for him. He's been a fantastic captain and is a great player,' Haskell said. 'But I want his shirt, it's as simple as that. I want Tom Wood's shirt and any of those in the back row. People like Will Fraser are coming up on the outside as well. 'So of course when you play these guys you want to win the game and win the individual battle. Haskell said Robshaw was a 'good friend' who h respected but he wanted his place in the side nontheless . 'I wasn't disappointed at all with the way I played against Harlequins on Saturday. 'Putting back the squad announcement has been great, it's really opened up the competition for everyone. 'It means players are picked on form. The England shirt is never yours and it's a level playing field.' Haskell has filled all three back row positions in a nomadic cub career that has included spells in France, Japan and New Zealand, but identifies openside as his preferred post. Stuart Lancaster has delayed the naming of his squad for the QBE Series until October 22 . The 29-year-old believes he can offer the turnover threat missing from England's established loose trio of Robshaw, Tom Wood and Billy Vunipola and insists you do not need a low centre of gravity to be an effective poacher. 'My favourite position over the last three or four years has been at seven, it's where I've played most of my rugby,' he said. 'The people I respect in the game play in that position. In terms of turnovers and impact I'm consistently up there in the Premiership. I fulfill a role there. 'The perception people have of an openside is of a squat guy getting over the ball, but size is irrelevant really. Haskell has filled all three back row positions in a nomadic cub career that has included a spell in Japan . 'If you have someone who has the skill set to do the job, gets around the park and has high involvement, that's what it's about. 'It's the balance of the back row that's most important, it doesn't matter what number you're wearing. 'I just don't buy into this squat thing....(Australia openside) Michael Hooper is an example of someone like that, but he hits like he's bigger than he is and carries like he's bigger than he is, but just happens to be that size.

"Harlequins rebounded from their surrender to Saracens by completing a stormy 26-23 Aviva Premiership victory over Wasps at Twickenham Stoop. Eight days after their players apologised to supporters for a dramatic 39-0 collapse on home soil, Quins drew on their reserves of character to dispatch another London rival. England internationals Chris Robshaw and Mike Brown ran in second-half tries after a 13-9 interval deficit was transformed into a 26-13 lead. Chris Robshaw responded to speculation surrounding his England captaincy with a solid performance . Robshaw's try and committed performance ended a week notable for speculation over his future as England captain and openside after being outfought by Saracens' Will Fraser. Fly-half Ben Botica, deputising for the injured Nick Evans, landed three penalties and two conversions and scrum-half Danny Care weighed in with a drop goal. Wasps were resurgent in the final quarter with tries from Tom Varndell and Thomas Young reeling in their opponents, but their fightback ran out of time. The result was the reaction Quins director of rugby Conor O'Shea was seeking after admitting his players were 'shot to pieces' after the Saracens rout. It is hard to see them challenging for the Premiership title, but it was a creditable win against opponents armed with a confidence boosting defeat of champions Northampton six days earlier. Harlequins rebounded from their surrender to Saracens by completing a stormy 26-23 victory over Wolves . Quins were criticised for their lack of intensity against Saracens and they clearly wanted to restore their reputation at the expense of Wasps. A fiery opening saw locks Charlie Matthews and Joe Launchbury grapple on the floor in the second flashpoint between the packs in as many minutes. But Wasps succeeded in absorbing the pressure and snatched a crucial turnover close to their goalline after a smart pass from Joe Marler sent George Robson rampaging forwards. And when they were offered sight of the whitewash themselves in the 15th minute they took their chance with Guy Thompson touching down. Varndell, try-scorer against Northampton on Sunday, opened up Quins' defence before the blindside was skillfully exploited with Elliot Daly sending Thompson over. Successive Botica penalties narrowed the gap in an absorbing contest between well-matched teams, but Andy Goode replied with six points to make amends for his poor kicking out of hand. Robshaw and Mike Brown ran in second-half tries after a 13-9 deficit was transformed into a 26-13 lead . Botica had the final say of the first half by steering the ball between the posts and six minutes into the second Quins exploded into life. Waves of runners were launched at a backpeddling defence that was beginning to splinter until Care varied the tactics by chipping over the top. Christian Wade should have touched the ball down over his own line - and replays suggest he may have applied downward pressure - before it squirted out to Robshaw who scored the simplest of tries. Four minutes later and Quins surged further ahead with Brown collecting Botica's chip via a rebound off the uprights and spinning over. Botica, who had slotted both conversions, was tripped by Kearnan Myall after his kick so the Wasps lock was dispatched to the sin-bin. Quins were now in full stride, playing with tempo and intent, and kept the scoreboard moving with a well-taken drop-goal from Care. The 2012 champions lost concentration in the 59th minute, however, allowing scrum-half Joe Simpson to turn a three-on-one overlap into a try for Varndell. A grandstand finish was set up when Wasps brought their forward power to bare at a line-out catch and drive that ended when Thomas Young barged over in the 77th minute, but Quins clung on to their lead.","Harlequins beat Wasps 26-23 at Twickenham Stoop .

"Travelling Galatasaray fans caused chaos by lighting up the Emirates with flares during their Champions League clash on Wednesday, but the trouble started well before they reached the stadium.

"Jack Wilshere insists Arsenal will recover after being outclassed by Borussia Dortmund in a disturbing start to their Champions League group campaign. Ciro Immobile and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang struck in a 2-0 victory for the Bundesliga club, but the winning margin should have been a landslide after the Gunners were overwhelmed at Signal Iduna Park. It was clearly their toughest fixture in Group D but the dismal performance has raised concerns over their ability to make any meaningful impact in Europe this season. Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere shows his frustration during the Gunners defeat to Borussia Dortmund . The Arsenal midfielder looks to get the better of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang during the game on Tuesday . Adding to the despondency is the ankle injury that forced Wilshere off in the closing stages. Arsene Wenger played down the severity of the sprain, but a more informed assessment is expected ahead of Saturday's Barclays Premier League trip to Aston Villa. 'We'll bounce back. Our next Champions League game (against Galatasaray on October 1) is at home and hopefully we'll get the three points,' Wilshere told the London Evening Standard. 'It's never nice to lose a game - we wanted to come here and win - but that was our first Champions League group game. 'We have got five more so we have an opportunity to try and get 15 points and that is what we'll try to do. 'It hasn't quite clicked for us yet but we've got a lot of quality players and I'm sure it'll come right.' Arsenal's shortcomings have left Wenger open to criticism on multiple fronts and the Frenchman faces some tough decisions. Dortmund ran amok in midfield, exposing club captain Mike Arteta's inability to shield the defence against bright opponents who think and act quickly. Once again Mesut Ozil drifted anonymously around the pitch, playing a couple of sublime passes but otherwise contributing little and his substitution on the hour mark was barely noticed. Danny Welbeck races past Erik Durm during the Champions League encounter but to no avail . Wenger will hope to have full-backs Nacho Monreal and Calum Chambers available for Villa after they missed out against Dortmund through injury and illness, but problems persist in defence. Misfortune has robbed Arsenal of Mathieu Debuchy for two to three months - the Frenchman has ankle ligament damage - but Laurent Koscielny and Per Mertesacker were poor at Signal Iduna Park. Wenger's refusal to add quality defensive cover other than Chambers and Debuchy over the summer has now returned to haunt him, placing his transfer policy under renewed scrutiny. And the manager must hope striker Danny Welbeck begins hitting the target as soon as possible after his second outing for Arsenal was against notable for wasted opportunities. 'It was disappointing against Dortmund. They are a good team and we have got to be a bit smarter when we come to places like this,' Wilshere said. 'With their gameplan, they wanted to press us high up the pitch and we let them do it in the first half. 'We started the second half quite brightly in the first couple of minutes and then unfortunately it was the same thing again on the counter attack and then the game is over. 'We knew what they were going to do. We should have played maybe a little bit longer in the first half than trying to play our football in our half of the pitch because once you lose it there, they are straight onto us. 'We had a few chances and even at 2-0, Danny had a chance and if he had scored that maybe the last 10 minutes would have been a different game.'","The Arsenal midfielder is confident his side will recover from being outclassed in their opening Champions League .

"The dispute over World Cup compensation between the Rugby Football Union and Premiership Rugby has been settled after a package worth up to £13million was agreed. The 2015-16 league season will start from the weekend of October 17 after the International Rugby Board granted dispensation for club games to be staged during the knockout phase of the tournament. Alarmed by the possibility of five income-free months because of England 2015 and the off-season, the Premiership clubs sought £14million in lost revenue from the RFU. Prince Harry, the England Rugby 2015 honorary president, holds the ball for World Cup ambassador Jonny Wilkinson during a photo call at the Rugby School . Head coach Lancaster says he has instilled a strong sense of national pride in his players . Some owners threatened to flout IRB regulations by playing throughout the entire World Cup if their demands were not met, but a complex agreement that is part-incentivised has now been reached. As part of the settlement, England head coach Stuart Lancaster will name his next elite player squad on October 22, delayed from its traditional slot in August. The additional time enables Lancaster to select from those players who are in form for November's QBE Series against New Zealand, South Africa, Samoa and Australia. 'It's a reflection of the strength of the partnership that once again we have managed to come to an arrangement that benefits both the RFU and clubs,' RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie said. 'We're very happy to continue to invest significant sums into Premiership Rugby and to support their desire to be successful on and off the pitch.' The agreement is made up of two parts with £6million generated by the re-allocation of match revenues for both union and clubs to increase income for 2015/16 and £7million in payments for the absence of Premiership rugby during the group stage of the World Cup. Whether the entirety of the £7million will be paid is subject to World Cup ticket sales and gross profit targets being met and on the signature of a new heads of agreement that covers areas such as player release and season structure. England players wear the new England rugby home kit, which has caused controversy over its design . England's players model the alternative red kit they will wear, with Victoria Cross design on the top half . 'By the very nature of the deal, the more successful the RFU is, the more the clubs benefit, while it is good that Premiership Rugby continue to use Twickenham to develop their competition,' Ritchie said. 'It is also significant that there is an incentive to conclude negotiations swiftly around a new long-term 'heads of agreement' that has proved so successful to date.' It has yet to be decided how England's 12 top-flight clubs will divide the income generated from the package. 'We have resolved a challenging issue in a mutually beneficial way through productive discussions over the last few months, largely behind the scenes,' Premiership Rugby chief executive Mark McCafferty said. 'This announcement underlines the partnership between Premiership Rugby and the RFU to help England's bid to achieve our goals in 2015 and beyond, as well as to support our clubs. 'The delay of the announcement of the elite player squad until October 22 has allowed the first six rounds of the Premiership to be a live trial for players striving to make that EPS.'

"James Haskell admits he will be inspired by Lawrence Dallaglio when he leads Wasps throughout the 2014-15 season. Haskell's first taste of captaincy will be Saturday's opening match of the traditional Aviva Premiership London double-header against Saracens at Twickenham. England great Dallaglio presided over the most successful period in Wasps' history, a reign that included four league titles and two Heineken Cup crowns. Stand and deliver: James Haskell will be the Wasps captain ahead of the 2014-15 Premiership season . Haskell played alongside Dallaglio for six years and while determined to forge his own path, he knows he will be influenced by a man he regards as the complete skipper. 'To me Lawrence was everything you want in a leader,' Haskell said. 'When he spoke you always felt he cared about what he was saying and he always backed it up, leading by example. 'He had the respect of the guys around him and that is all you can ask for. 'I'm not trying to be Lawrence and I won't copy him, but you can't help but be inspired by a guy who was a natural leader and had respect from people.' Haskell is one of the game's more colourful personalities, but he understands the need to be economical with his words when required. 'The last thing you want is to be someone who just talks,' he said. 'The boys find out pretty quickly if you are covering for your inefficiencies by putting great Churchillian speeches together. If that happens, you'll fall flat on your face. 'As long as I perform on the field and get the respect of the guys, then that is key.' It's mine to keep right? Haskell poses with the Aviva Premiership trophy before the start of the season . Wasps have been lifted by the return of Christian Wade - a potential solution to England's problems on the wing - from the foot injury that has kept him sidelined since November. Will Fraser's own injury problems are over, so he is restored at openside by Saracens as he begins his quest to challenge for Chris Robshaw's England jersey. Robshaw's load in World Cup year has been lightened by Harlequins' decision to relieve him of the captaincy after four seasons and give it to Joe Marler, who will lead the side against London Irish on Saturday. Tough act to follow: Lawrence Dallaglio won the Heineken Cup as Wasps captain in 2007 . Marland Yarde makes his debut following his summer move from the Exiles and despite the England wing's arrival, Quins have been widely tipped to miss the play-offs this season. 'We want to be the best we can be individually and collectively. If we manage that, we'll be hard to beat,' director of rugby Conor O'Shea said. 'Anyone can finish in the top four. We've been written off as the team that will drop out this season, but we were written off last season but still got in. 'Anyone who writes us off is deluded if you look at the quality of the team we can put out.' Fly-half George Ford returns from shoulder surgery to pull the strings for Bath against Sale and will duel with England rival Danny Cipriani at the AJ Bell Stadium.

"Northampton’s devastating start to their Aviva Premiership title defence is now a distant memory after they crashed to a 20-16 defeat against Wasps at Adams Park. As an otherwise dull contest entered its final quarter, Saints’ 9-3 lead built on three penalties from Stephen Myler was transformed into a 17-9 deficit. Tries from flanker Ashley Johnson and wing Tom Varndell in two minutes placed Wasps in a commanding position in a match where every point was a battleground. London Wasps flanker Ashley Johnson escapes the tackle of Northampton's Stephen Myler . Ashley Johnson crosses for the first of Wasps' two tries as they upset Northampton 20-16 at Adams Park . Full-back Ben Foden crossed with two minutes remaining to salvage a bonus point as a late surge from Saints was repelled. For Northampton it was an almighty comedown after the reigning champions had routed Gloucester 53-6 nine days ago, scoring eight tries in the process. They failed to capitalise on a glut of possession and were devoid of ideas with gamebreakers such as George North and Luther Burrell barely involved. Wasps, who saw Andy Goode, Ruaridh Jackson and Rob Miller contribute points from the kicking tee, were worthy winners and will draw enormous confidence from the result. It was a hard watch at times, most noticeably in a grim first half that began with Myler and Goode exchanging penalties. Northampton had spent most of the opening quarter trying to breach a robust home defence but while they had plenty of ball, the gaps were not appearing. Winger Tom Varndell crosses for Wasps second try within two minutes as they claim the lead . Tom Varndell celebrates his try as Wasps claim victory over the Aviva Premiership defending champions . Goode was marginally wide with a long-range penalty and a half that was passing without event produced fireworks at a 30th-minute line-out. Johnson took out Alex Corbisiero and as the two lay on the floor the England loosehead threw a punch. After consulting the TMO, referee Luke Pearce issued yellow cards to both players. Stephen Myler kicks one of this three penalties . The pressure should have increased on the home whitewash when Saints won a five-metre scrum, but Wasps responded by forcing the penalty. On the next phase of play Wasps attacked with purpose for the first time, James Haskell, Varndell and Nathan Hughes making yards until full-back Andrea Masi was penalised for holding on to the ball. Any excitement quickly subsided as the match continued its uneventful path. With the score so tight points were at a premium, so Northampton must have cursed when Myler struck the right upright with a very kickable penalty. North had to wait until the 49th minute for his first touch of the ball, but the TMO intervened to deny him a try for being in front of Ken Pisi when the wing chipped ahead. Successive penalties from Myler appeared to give Saints some breathing space but that lasted only until Wasps plundered two quickfire tries. The first came when Johnson picked off Burrell’s pass intended for North and won the race to the right corner. Before they had the chance to compose themselves Saints conceded a second after a piece of magic from Varndell. Wasps worked the ball to their left wing and with little space to exploit he chipped ahead, gathered the kick and dived over. Replacement fly-half Jackson landed both conversions, but then had to be helped from the pitch with what appeared to be a significant injury. But Miller picked up where Jackson left off by landing a penalty that swept Wasps out of reach with Ben Foden’s late try proving too little, too late.","Ashley Johnson and Tom Varndell scored for Wasps to take control .

"Australia's Jason Day moved joint top of the leaderboard alongside overnight leader Ryan Palmer following the second round at the Deutsche Bank Championship. The 26-year-old, in search of his third PGA Tour triumph, carded a 68 to add to his opening 66 in Boston to move into a one-shot lead with Palmer on eight under par. Day recorded a flawless front nine where he claimed five birdies, but his back nine let him down and he could have taken the outright lead at the halfway stage had he not suffered with bogeys on the 12th, 14th and 18th holes to go three-under for the round. Charge: Jason Day shares the lead ahead of the third round of the Deutsche Bank Championship . American Palmer also endured a mixed round and a double bogey on the second could have meant trouble, but he claimed five birdies among three bogeys to finish level on par and in the lead for the second day. One shot further back are Palmer's compatriots Matt Kuchar and Billy Horschel, who both enjoyed an impressive round of 66 to stay in contention. Kuchar, who hit a 69 on Friday, admitted he was struggling on day one after hearing of the sudden death of his caddie Lance Bennett's wife Angela two days earlier after suffering a seizure. He told www.pgatour.com: 'Today was easier. I think that's the natural progression of how these things work. (I) still felt like Angela was on my mind almost every hole, every shot. But yesterday I had a hard time following through a couple of times.' Horschel's round was almost flawless, a bogey on the eighth the only blemish among six birdies.

World number one Rory McIlroy was two under ahead of the third round, the PGA Championship and Open Championship winner improving his first-round score by one shot with 69 on a scorecard including three birdies and a bogey on the front nine, but a double bogey on the 14th set him back before he ended the round with two further birdies.

"Gary Lineker believes it is 'essential' Arsenal sign a new striker during the transfer window if they want to challenge for major silverware. Gunners boss Arsene Wenger is refusing to panic buy a replacement for Olivier Giroud, who has been ruled out until the New Year with a broken tibia. Giroud's injury has limited Wenger's striking options to Alexis Sanchez, who is more effective as a winger, and the inexperienced Yaya Sanogo and Joel Campbell. Pain game: Olivier Giroud looks set to be out of action until the new year with an ankle injury . Lukas Podolski can play up front but has been linked with a move away from the Emirates Stadium, while another possibility, Theo Walcott, is sidelined with a knee problem. Former England marksman Lineker believes Wenger must add firepower to his squad before the transfer window closes on Monday. 'Arsenal needed to sign a forward whether Giroud was injured or not,' said Lineker, who was speaking as part of Walkers' 'Do Us A Flavour' campaign. In the goals: Giroud scored Arsenal's equalizer against Everton at the weekend . 'Now that he's injured it's essential for them really if they're to compete for major titles . 'Forward is one position where they needed to strengthen. You could say in midfield too, but particularly up-front. 'If they could add a player who could guarantee 25-goals a season that would be hugely beneficial to them. 'Arsene has showed a lot of faith in Giroud and he's a good player who will score goals, but he's not hugely prolific and lacks a bit of pace to be that.' Taking his chance: Arsene Wenger could decide to use Joel Campbell instead of buying a striker . Sanchez operated as lone striker in Wednesday night's 1-0 victory over Besiktas and rewarded Wenger's faith by opening his Arsenal account with a goal that secured the Gunners' place in the Champions League group stage. However, Lineker shares a widely-held belief that the £35million signing from Barcelona is better suited to a wider role. 'Striker isn't Sanchez's natural position, he prefers it out wide, certainly on the right-hand side of a three,' Lineker said. Stepping up: Wenger believes new signing Alexis Sanchez can play in a more forward role . 'I'm sure he can play striker because he's a terrific player, but I'm not sure it brings out the best in him. 'He's better when he's facing people and going at them, rather than having his back to goal.' Sanchez was superb against Besiktas with a glaring second-half miss failing to devalue an energetic performance full of desire and commitment.","Olivier Giroud has been ruled out until the beginning of next year .

"England head coach Stuart Lancaster admitted he was forced to read his under-performing team the riot act at half-time of Saturday's 36-13 rout by New Zealand. The All Blacks had amassed a 29-6 interval lead after exploiting a passive defence with Julian Savea and Aaron Smith plundering two tries each. Disaster beckoned in the second half of the climax to the series at the Waikato Stadium, but an improved England responded with a touch down from Marland Yarde. Disappointed: England head coach Stuart Lancaster read the team the riot act at half time . 'We had some pretty sharp words at half-time and we showed a lot more urgency and intensity in the second half and that was reflected in the performance,' Lancaster said. 'There's two or three opportunities that we missed and we scored the try.' Narrow losses in Auckland and Dunedin had already placed the series beyond reach, leaving England with the goal of salvaging some pride from the final Test. Instead, they were blown away as the All Blacks registered a record-equalling 17th successive victory with the deadly Savea claiming his eighth try in four games against the Red Rose. 'We fought hard for two Tests and fought hard in the second-half of the third, but we are behind them in all areas at the moment,' Lancaster said. 'For us to win at this level we need to be better and we know that. 'The . objective ultimately was to come and win the series and we haven't . achieved that, so in that regard we are hugely disappointed. Hat-trick hero: Julian Savea was just too good for England today . 'But we've shown enough to demonstrate we are a young team on the up and we have a lot of growth still in us.' England's feeble first-half tackling was punished by the brilliant All Blacks, who should have scored at least two more tries with their head coach Steve Hansen admitting they became 'greedy'. Kyle Eastmond repeatedly waved New Zealand's midfield through and as a result was replaced by Luther Burrell at half-time. Assistant coach Andy Farrell offered an honest assessment of England's shortcomings and reflected on Eastmond's ordeal just two weeks after the Bath centre had starred in the first Test. 'Our defence started poorly and it got worse. We were reactive instead of going and getting them, which our defence has always been about,' Farrell said. 'We certainly weren't anywhere near 80 per cent and you need all hands on deck to play an international game. 'The . first half wasn't good enough and we have something in black and white . now for what intensity looks like and what it definitely doesn't look . like. Bleak: Marland Yarde was the only try-scorer on a dismal night for the England side . 'I chatted with Kyle for 10 minutes and he's disappointed. Two or three weeks ago we were talking about the progress he's made and everyone was raving about his performance in Auckland. 'You don't become a bad player overnight by any. It's the intensity part that he struggled with. 'Kyle's got all the skills, he was just a bit off the pace as far as getting set and being ready to go were concerned.' New Zealand became the third team to string together 17 Test victories and have the opportunity to break the record when they face Australia in Sydney on August 16. Talk of the achievement was banned by the All Blacks in the build up to Saturday's showdown in Hamilton, but captain Richie McCaw finally admitted his team have set it as an objective. 'You don't make a big deal of the record but it's something we're keen to achieve. We want it outright,' McCaw said. 'We acknowledge it and then work out how to achieve it. It's about preparing well and getting ready to perform. If we get that right we'll add the win we want.'","England coach read his team the riot act after Kiwi's first-half onslaught .

"New Zealand head coach Steve Hansen claims England are facing a dilemma over their tactics after discovering they are unable to match the All Blacks at a fast-paced game. Stuart Lancaster's tourists enter the series finale at Waikato Stadium hoping to salvage some pride after slumping to defeat in the first two Tests. They were blown away in the third quarter of the 28-27 loss in Dunedin, conceding three tries in 11 devastating minutes as New Zealand delivered a lesson in the art of finishing. Blown away: Ma'a Nonu (centre) celebrates scoring the first of three New Zealand tries in 11 minutes . England entered the series hoping to develop the high-tempo gameplan that served them well during the RBS 6 Nations, but Hansen insists they are now overcome with doubt. 'They are in a bit of a quandary really because they took us on in Dunedin playing a game of real pace and worked out they couldn't,' he said. 'So what are they going to do now? I've seen Lancaster mention in the paper that maybe they shouldn't play too much rugby down their end, so maybe they're going to kick a wee bit more. 'But they will have a good plan because they are good coaches, so we've just got to make sure we've got a good one to counter it. 'England are a determined bunch so they'll want to put in another performance they can be proud of, so I don't think we've broken their spirit. Re-jig: Head coach Stuart Lancaster has made seven changes to the side that started in Dunedin . Stoking the fire: All Blacks head coach Steve Hansen has questioned England's selection . 'They're a group of people who believe in themselves, so they'll get up again for the last Test.' England arrived in New Zealand outlining their intent to win the series but have been outplayed by the world champions over the first two Tests. In the 20-15 victory at Eden Park the All Blacks produced the match-winning try two minutes from time and in Dunedin they emerged convincing winners, even if the scoreline suggests otherwise. A 2-1 series defeat would be viewed as an acceptable return and head coach Stuart Lancaster admits their summer tour should be deemed a success or failure based on Saturday's outcome. 'The series will be judged ultimately by the scoreline. We desperately want that win and that's why we need to put in a high-quality performance,' Lancaster said. Try time: Marland Yarde was one of three Englishmen to touch down in the second Test . 'We will judge the tour by results but also the knowledge and experience we've learned about our players. 'The ability to learn who can and who can't deliver at the highest level has been absolutely invaluable. 'You can watch as many DVDs and games as you like, but it's only when you get your hands on players week in week out that you really learn the true strengths of individuals. 'That's been the most invaluable part of the tour because that's what you need leading up to a World Cup.'

"England have overhauled their backline for . Saturday's final Test against New Zealand in Hamilton with Kyle . Eastmond and Manu Tuilagi reunited in the centres. The . experiment of playing Tuilagi on the wing has been abandoned after just . one match, although head coach Stuart Lancaster insists it will be . revisited in the future. Making his . first start since the autumn, the revitalised Chris Ashton returns in . the number 14 jersey for the Waikato Stadium encounter. Central Line: Manu Tuilagi will return to his favoured position when England meet New Zealand in Hamilton . Demoted: Luther Burrell (L) and Billy Twelvetrees have been sacrificed to make changes . The Billy Twelvetrees and Luther Burrell partnership that flourished throughout the RBS 6 Nations has been disbanded following the 28-27 defeat in Dunedin that completed a series triumph for the All Blacks. Instead, Eastmond and Tuilagi have been offered the stage to reproduce the fireworks that lit up Eden Park in the first Test in a selection Lancaster insists is based on form. Twelvetrees has paid for his erratic display at the Forsyth Barr Stadium with Lancaster admitting it was a 'big step' for him to play his first match since May 3 in that game. Fitness was an issue for Twelvetrees having been sidelined by an ankle injury for six weeks, and while he will be given another chance at a later date, there is a sense that England are losing patience with the Gloucester playmaker. 'This is a reflection of us feeling that the centre partnership worked better in first Test than in he second,' said Lancaster, who has picked Burrell on the bench. Diving in: Chris Ashton will take over Manu Tuilagi's place on the wing against New Zealand . 'We are still finding out which players can and can't really deliver at the highest level. 'We've had a good chance to look at Billy during the course of the season. 'Kyle's had one opportunity and he's taken it. Now's the right time to give him a second chance. 'Billy wasn't that far off it at the weekend, but when I look at the two games I thought Kyle edged him.' Owen . Farrell's tour-ending knee problem means Freddie Burns, another . standout player at Eden Park, starts at fly-half with Ben Youngs holding . off a strong challenge from Lee Dickson in the absence of . shoulder-injury victim Danny Care. In a spin: England coach Stuart Lanacster denies that his seven personnel changes are excessive . 'Freddie played well in the first . Test and the challenge for him is to back that up with a comparable . performance,' Lancaster said. Following a fine display in Tuesday's . 38-7 victory over the Crusaders, Danny Cipriani has been chosen ahead of . Stephen Myler to provide specialist cover at 10. Lancaster admits he . made the decision on the strength of Cipriani's game management at . Christchurch's AMI Stadium as the once-troubled Sale playmaker continues . his climb back up the pecking order. 'I was really pleased with . Danny's 45 minutes against the Crusaders,' said Lancaster, who admitted . Myler had been a victim of the fixture congestion that marred . preparations for the first Test. 'I needed to see Danny start and . needed to see whether he could control and run a game as well as do the . other bits and pieces. I thought he did that really well.

"England look set to name Kyle Eastmond at inside centre for Saturday's opening Test against New Zealand after Billy Twelvetrees lost his race to be fit for the series opener at Eden Park. Twelvetrees' ankle injury prevented him from training on Tuesday in the final practice session before head coach Stuart Lancaster names his team on Wednesday night. The Gloucester back has been out since May 3 and his lingering fitness worries offer Eastmond the chance to win a third cap. Incoming: Bath's Kyle Eastmond looks set to replace Billy Twelvetrees for England against New Zealand . Crocked: Twelvetrees is the first choice inside centre but has failed to recover since being injured in May (right) Chance: Eastmond impressed with two appearances in Argentina last year but has not played since April 27 . England head into the three-match series with a much depleted squad but they can take heart from their last two performances against the All Blacks. Lancaster's side beat New Zealand 38-21 - a record margin - in November 2012 before narrowly losing to the All Blacks 30-22 at Twickenham last year. Eastmond, a rugby league convert, impressed during last summer's tour to Argentina but recently fell out of favour at Bath and has not played since April 27. Operating inside the 24-year is expected to be another player who is fourth choice in his position - Leicester-bound Freddie Burns. The fly-half has been desperately short of form when picked by Gloucester, but he appears to have edged out Danny Cipriani in the triple absence of Owen Farrell, Stephen Myler and George Ford. Headache: England head coach Stuart Lancaster is having to pick a side from a much depleted squad . In from the cold: Danny Cipriani looks likely to feature on the bench for England after a fine season for Sale . England will otherwise select a familiar backline with Danny Care at scrum-half, Manu Tuilagi outside Eastmond at 13, Marland Yarde and Jonny May on the wings and Mike Brown at full-back. The key decision in the forwards concerns who will partner Joe Launchbury in the second row, with Geoff Parling's line-out expertise likely to see him chosen ahead of the more abrasive Dave Attwood. The front row picks itself with Rob Webber, who has overcome a knee problem, packing down alongside Joe Marler and David Wilson. In the back row, the trio that finished the RBS 6 Nations will almost survive intact with the physicality of James Haskell likely to see him fill the shoes of Tom Wood, with Chris Robshaw at openside and Ben Morgan at No 8. New Zealand also name their 23 on Wednesday, with Jerome Kaino in pole position to replace No 8 Kieran Read, who has been ruled out with concussion. Record: England beat New Zealand 38-21 in November 2012 but will field a much weakened side at Eden Park .

"Stuart Lancaster declared that England are making progress despite slumping to a series defeat following New Zealand's 28-27 victory at the Forsyth Barr Stadium. The rivals produced three tries apiece in a breathtaking second Test in Dunedin but it was a devastating third-quarter spell that enabled the All Blacks to extend their triumphant run to 16 matches. Ben Smith, Julian Savea and Ma'a Nonu crossed to establish a 28-13 lead after England had entered the interval 10-6 up, a scoreline which failed to fully reward their dominant first half. Agonising: Manu Tuilagi (right) and England lost both matches narrowly to give New Zealand the series . Positives: England head coach Stuart Lancaster (left) and Andy Farrell (right) remain upbeat despite defeat . Mike Brown darted over in the 72nd minute to offer hope of a fightback that quickly faded and Chris Ashton's injury-time try merely offered pride in defeat. 'We're disappointed to have come away with nothing having worked so hard. We put ourselves in a position to win after the first half,' Lancaster said. 'We have high expectations on this tour and having lost the first game so narrowly we wanted to level the series and take it to a decider in Hamilton. 'But they are high-quality opposition and after another week together you could see the improved cohesion in their performance. 'There were one or two errors in our game which presented them with opportunities, but overall the positives far outweigh the negatives. 'Overall I felt the backline created a lot of opportunities as a group. The frustration for us is not finishing the opportunities. Try: All Black centre Ma'a Nonu (centre) races away to score one of three New Zealand tries . Close: Marland Yarde scored the first of England's three consolation tries against New Zealand . 'Scoring three tries in Dunedin is not a bad return so we are moving in the right direction but still, we didn't quite finish the deal. 'It's decision-making at the highest level that we need to look at and that's probably the next step we need to take with the team.' England were magnificent in the first half and established an early 10-0 lead through Marland Yarde's try and five points from Owen Farrell. Yarde's pace and strength troubled the All Blacks, as did Billy Twelvetrees' distribution and vision, but the tourists' dominance was not reflected on the scoreboard. And when New Zealand eased through the gears in a clinical 11-minute spell started when Twelvetrees gave the ball away, enabling the magnificent Smith to score, they had cantered out of sight. 'We were pushing the pace in the first half and in the second half the All Blacks showed why they're the world champions,' defence coach Andy Farrell said. 'Their speed of thought and the speed at which they played the game was outstanding. Defeat: England captain Chris Robshaw looks dejected following the 2-0 series loss to New Zealand . Fierce: New Zealand perform the Haka before the second Test against England in Dunedin . 'Their core skills are excellent as well. That we got ourselves back into the game when we could have conceded a barrage of points says everything about us.' The experiment of playing Manu Tuilagi on the wing was unsuccessful on this occasion with the Leicester Tiger, who was tackled by Smith just short of the line after a 60-metre run, failing to make an impact. When asked whether he would persevere with Tuilagi in the number 14 jersey, Lancaster said: 'We'll wait and see really, we'll have to assess the game. We won't make the decision until Wednesday.'

"Former England centre Shontayne Hape has announced his retirement from the game after sustaining repeated concussions that led to a range of debilitating symptoms, including depression. Hape played his final match for French club Montpellier last year, but only this weekend revealed he was forced to hang up his boots because of the head trauma incurred during his league and union careers. The 33-year-old, who won 13 caps for England between 2010-11, suffered more than 20 concussions and was frequently knocked out, including several times in succession during the 2012-13 season at Montpellier. Calling it a day: Former England centre Shontayne Hape has announced his retirement from the game . Subsequent scans revealed his brain function had been reduced to just above that of someone with special needs and he was advised to retire. 'Things got so bad I couldn't even remember my pin number - my card got swallowed up twice. My memory was shot,' Hape told the New Zealand Herald. 'The specialist explained that my brain was so traumatised, had swollen so big, that even just getting a tap to the body would knock me out. I had to retire immediately. 'I was thinking I'd rest for a year and then make a come back. That's why I never told anyone I was retired. I still couldn't accept it was over.' Among the symptoms Auckland-born Hape felt were constant migraines, sensitivity to light and sound, irritability, depression and memory loss. Concussion: Hape's brain function had been reduced to just above that of someone with special needs . 'There was constant pressure from the coaches (to play),' the former New Zealand Warriors, Bradford, Bath and London Irish back said. 'Most coaches don't care what happens later on in your life.

"England's prospects of delivering an unlikely victory in Saturday's first Test against New Zealand have improved after Kieran Read was ruled out of the series opener at Eden Park. All Blacks head coach Steve Hansen revealed that Read, who has been sidelined since April with concussion, woke up on Monday morning 'not feeling the best'. The reigning International Rugby Board player of the year made his comeback for the Crusaders on Saturday only to subsequently suffer a recurrence of the symptoms that have troubled him for the last month.

Read’s loss will be keenly felt with the free-roaming back row among New Zealand’s most influential players, but Hansen refuses to overstate the impact his absence will have. 'Losing players is only disruptive if we allow it to be. Rugby is a contact sport, we’re going to have people get injured and we just have to deal with that,' Hansen said.

"New Zealand head coach Steve Hansen regards Stuart Lancaster's England as the most improved team in Test rugby and refuses to view their series opener as a foregone conclusion. Preparations for the first Test at Eden Park have been undermined by a debilitating injury list and the absence of players from Aviva Premiership finalists Northampton and Saracens. It has weakened England for the toughest assignment in the game, but the All Blacks, who on Sunday named a 31-man squad for the series, are ready to face a growing force in the international arena. Respect: Speaking to the media New Zealand coach Steve Hansen (centre) said his team respects England . Missing: The Aviva Premiership Final meant a lot of players have been missing from the England squad . 'England have been the most improved side in world rugby in the last two years,' Hansen said. 'Stuart Lancaster has built depth in his side and a strong culture, so they will be a formidable opponent and one we are very excited about playing. 'Those who think England will be fielding a weak side in the first Test are completely underestimating the quality of depth in the England squad. 'Make no mistake, England have a very strong desire and belief that they can win this series. Having said that, so do the All Blacks. Hansen (right) said that it would be unwise to underestimate England . Strong: Hansen called Stuart Lancaster's side as the most improved in the world .

"David Wilson insists England's first Test underdogs are refusing to accept their roles as victims in waiting for world champions New Zealand. The tourists enter Saturday's series opener at Eden Park without players from Aviva Premiership finalists Northampton and Saracens and hamstrung by an extensive injury list. Head coach Stuart Lancaster names his team on Wednesday night and is poised to pick those who are third or fourth choice at hooker, fly-half and inside centre. Optimistic: England's David Wilson believes his team can compete with New Zealand despite a long list of absentees . Arrayed against them will be a vastly experienced All Blacks line-up that won all 14 of their Tests last year and have triumphed in every match at Eden Park since 1994. But Wilson, who will be making his first start but fifth appearance against New Zealand, is adamant England can cause an upset. 'If you look at the world rankings we'd probably be underdogs, but coming to New Zealand that's to be expected. We'll thrive on that and give it everything,' the Bath tighthead said. 'You have to believe you can win every game. It's a big challenge because they're the best team in the world, but we're here to test ourselves against the best leading up to the World Cup. Driving on: Wilson says England will thrive on the underdogs tag when they face the All Blacks in the first Test at Eden Park, Auckland on Saturday . 'We have belief within the camp and what we've done in the past. 'It's a brilliant opportunity for everybody involved. As a schoolboy I used to dream about playing in New Zealand. And here I am. 'You know they're a class act, but they're 15 men and so are we. We did actually beat them two years ago and we can remember that.' In the 27 matches of Lancaster's reign, England have lost by more than nine points on only one occasion - the 30-3 rout by Wales last year. Hard to beat: England have only lost one match by more than nine points during Stuart Lancaster's tenure . That spirit will be essential if they are to avoid a morale-draining heavy defeat just one Test into the series, and Wilson outlines the expectation for Saturday. 'We've come here hoping to compete with New Zealand in their own back yard,' Wilson said. 'If we're in the game around the 70-75 minute mark when it can go either way, that's where we aim to be.'","England head into first Test at Eden Park with extensive injury list .

Less than 24 hours after it emerged that Bath fly-half George Ford will miss the tour to undergo shoulder surgery, Brown insisted he will be ready to face the All Blacks. The 28-year-old sustained a hip injury in Harlequins' Aviva Premiership semi-final defeat by Saracens on Saturday, but is on track to resume training on Monday. Ready: Mike Brown (left) has declared himself fit for England's first Test against New Zealand . England depart for New Zealand the following day and by the time they run-out at Eden Park, Brown expects to be fit to continue an outstanding season. 'It's a deep hip muscle injury,' said Brown, winner of England player of the year at the Rugby Players Association awards dinner on Wednesday night. 'I gave everything a big yank when I was twisted in the tackle on that turf. I overstretched it all.'It's feeling good each day. A bit more recovery and on Monday I'll be ready to rock and roll in training. It's definitely looking good for that first Test. 'I've had the same problem before after tough games, but to a lesser extent, so I know how to get rid of it and what I need to do. 'I've got great people around me to help me get fit and I can't wait to get out to New Zealand.'Brown's improving fitness will be greeted with relief by head coach Stuart Lancaster, who has seen his plans for the first Test continue to unravel amid Ford's withdrawal. Official confirmation that the 21-year-old requires an operation is expected after Friday's night's Amlin Challenge Cup final against Northampton in Cardiff, his final game of the season. Ford was destined to start at Eden Park as Owen Farrell and Stephen Myler are involved in the Premiership final on May 31 and will be unavailable until the second Test.Lancaster must choose between the recently returned Danny Cipriani, out of form Freddie Burns or Billy Twelvetrees, who is struggling with an ankle injury, at fly-half. Winner: Brown (centre) receives the England Player of the Year award . Adding to Lancaster's concerns, besides the absence of players from Premiership finalists Northampton and Saracens, is a crisis at hooker where potentially his first three choices in the position will be unable to tour. Tom Youngs has been ruled out for personal reasons and Dylan Hartley and Rob Webber are struggling with respective shoulder and knee problems. Furthermore, British and Irish Lions forwards Alex Corbisiero and Tom Croft have been given the summer off after returning from long-term injuries, while prop Dan Cole and wing Jack Nowell are in the treatment room. Against this bleak backdrop England will attempt to complete a maiden series victory in New Zealand having posted only two previous victories there in 12 attempts dating back to 1963. Missing out: Bath fly-half George Ford (right) will miss the tour to undergo shoulder surgery . History and circumstance, however, are unable to dim Brown's belief that the 2015 World Cup hosts are capable of toppling the all-conquering All Blacks. 'I don't see why we can't win this series. We've put in two good performances against New Zealand, beaten them once and narrowly lost once,' he said. 'It will be unbelievably tough playing the number one team on their home patch. 'They'll come flying into us and the fact we're missing a few guys for that first Test makes it even harder for us. 'But there are guys who will come in and will be desperate to show what they can do in an England shirt.'","England full-back Mike Brown is fit to face New Zealand .

"Glasgow laid a strong marker with a confident five-try defeat of Premiership side Bath that clinched a double winning start to the new European competitions for Scottish clubs. After Edinburgh's win at Bordeaux in the new European rugby Challenge Cup the night before, the Warriors launched their European Rugby Champions Cup with a comprehensive demolition of one of England's form sides of the season. Three tries in the first half was the response to a fortunate early Bath score and, after soaking up some pressure in the third quarter with a solid defence, the Warriors added to their lead with a flurry of late points. Glasgow had beaten Bath at home before, but for the first time in 18 years of European rugby, the Scottish team headed into the main tournament with genuine belief of competing with Europe's form sides as opposed to mere hope. Glasgow fullback Stuart Hogg beats Bath centre Jonathan Joseph to a high ball . In a pool featuring Toulouse and Montpellier, the quarter-finals remain some distance away, but this was as convincing a start as coach Gregor Townsend could have hoped for. Bath had won four of their first six Premiership matches, while Glasgow came into the game on the back of a first defeat in six Guinness Pro12 games. The visitors came shorn of several backrowers, notably Springbok Francois Louw, while Glasgow were also without tal ismanic No8 Josh Strauss, and the Warriors took advantage by dominating the breakdown and set-piece. Bath's Ross Batty is well tackled by the Glasgow duo of Leone Nakarawa (right) and Chris Fusaro . That ensured that the Bath danger-men, fly-half George Ford and centres Kyle Eastmond and Jonathan Joseph, had precious little ball and territory in which to cause the kind of havoc in which they have revelled this season. Ford did put the first points on the board, with a penalty from the Warriors' 10-metre line after just three minutes, awarded for a scrum collapse blamed on home loosehead Gordon Reid, and England's 'new Jonny Wilkinson' was at the heart of Bath's astute kicking game. Only stern defence, prop Euan Murray stopping Fijian/England A wing Semesa Rokoduguni and Peter Horne getting fingers to a Ford pass 15 metres from the line, kept them at bay early on. It did not take long for Glasgow to respond once they grasped the ball. Tommy Seymour made the first crucial break, rolling Anthony Watson backwards, and play was taken on into the Bath 22 wi th composure and momentum before Mark Bennet t showed hi s dancing feet to step two defenders and go in under the posts. Bath fly-half George Ford gets into a tangle with Duncan Weir during the clash at the Scotstoun Stadium . However, the capacity Scotstoun crowd was still celebrating when Bath hit back, Ford's high up-and-under being lost by Stuart Hogg's fingertips and Joseph pouncing to sprint in behind the home posts for a simple try. That handed Bath a 10-7 lead after just 12 minutes, but home fly-half Duncan Weir shifted momentum back Glasgow's way with two penalties either side of the 20-minute mark. The Warriors provided the perfect riposte, however. The defence was solid, the forwards produced superb work at the breakdown to turn over Bath and from a Pyrgos high ball, Seymour regained possession on the visitors' 22 to launch an attack that ended with Maitland crashing over on the right-hand side with 29 minutes on the clock. Eastmond was then crunched in a tackle that left the centre in obvious rib pain, and while he opted to continue - for a few more minutes - the Warriors were soon back at the Bath line. From a free-kick Pyrgos fed Hogg and he found Seymour who dived into the lefthand corner. The Scotland winger required treatment, having taken a heavy knock to the leg in scoring, but he hobbled back into position to an ovation from the stands and duly claimed the restart. Glasgow scrum-half Nico Matawalu dives over to clinch his side's fourth try and a precious bonus point . Glasgow went inside 23-10 up, and it could have been more had Weir been successful with the conversion and a penalty just before half-time. Seymour was replaced by DTH van der Merwe at half-time and Bath strived to regain parity in the forward exchanges, sending on experienced front rows Rob Webber, Paul James and David Wilson and also replacing backs Gavin Henson and Micky Young with Horacio Agulla and Peter Stringer. It stemmed the Glasgow momentum but failed to change the outcome. Glasgow's defence was opened up twice by Rokoduguni and Ford, and only a last-ditch tackle by Pat MacArthur and Murray denied Bath skipper Hooper from scoring, but the Warriors soaked up that period of Bath pressure and lifted the tempo again in a pulsating final quarter. A huge cheer greeted the introduction on the hour of Niko Matawalu, for skipper Pyrgos who was voted Man of the Match, and within minutes he showed why. Weir and substitute Finn Russell (right) celebrate a job well done at full-time . The Fijian magician had seized on a turnover, chipped the ball through the Bath defence and reacted first to Bennett's hack forward to snatch up the ball and score in the right-hand corner - even throwing in a cheeky dummy to Maitland before doing so. Weir converted from the touchline for a 30-10 lead, but that only fired the Warriors further and superb inter-play by Bennett and van der Merwe ended with another chip ahead and Bennett touching down with 10 minutes to go. Bath's spirited attempts to finish with a flourish foundered on the Glasgow rocks, too, which left the home support toasting their team's most impressive home win in Europe.","Tries from Mark Bennett (two), Sean Maitland, Tommy Seymour and Nico Matawalu ensure stunning triumph over in-form Bath .

"Just 48 hours after England had finished runners-up in a dramatic climax to the 2014 RBS 6 Nations, Stuart Lancaster retreated to Tenerife to enter his 'cave'. Needing to balance the demands of performing an all-encompassing job alongside raising a young family, Lancaster agreed with wife Nina that he would spend two days alone on the Canary Island. Holiday makers were surprised to spot England's head coach sitting at poolside as he reflected on an encouraging Six Nations, while daughter Sophie greeted his decision to dine alone with the message 'weirdo'. Loner: Stuart Lancaster took some time out to collect his thoughts following the Six Nations . Having organised his thoughts, he returned home to Leeds to resume a family life currently being interupted for five weeks by the impending summer tour to New Zealand and that will continue to dwindle as the 2015 World Cup looms. 'Sometimes I need space to think things through and that's always the biggest challenge of the job because there are so many moving parts,' Lancaster told Press Association Sport. 'You've been away in camp and you need some space to think and reflect, plan and review, but you also want to spend time with your family. 'The kids are 13 and 14, so quite formative years. My teaching background tells me that dad needs to be around as much as possible. 'There's a lot of scrutiny around the job, but it's the time away from home that's the biggest pressure. 'It worked better after this Six Nations when I told my wife that I needed a day and a half, which she described as me going into my cave. 'She said she didn't mind as long as I came out at the end of it! 'It was a bit of thinking time in the sun, a couple of beers. I was on my own, sat at poolside. I needed to do some work and the review. 'Loads of people recognised me and kept asking ""what are you doing on your own?!"". 'I sent a text to my daughter on the Monday evening and said ""I'm just having a meal in this restaurant"". 'She asked who was I with and when I replied no-one, she text me back saying 'weirdo' and turned the phone off! That's the price of fame! It was quite funny really. 'It was what I needed - I did my work, got back and was out of my cave.' Turnaround: Lancaster has turned England into challengers for the 2015 World Cup after 2011's disaster . The two years of Lancaster's stewardship have seen England emerge from the wreckage of their dismal 2011 World Cup to become a force capable of challenging for the Webb Ellis trophy next year. Alongside the overhaul of a team that had lost its way during successive failed regimes, Lancaster has established a squad culture that makes a repeat of the reputation-damaging visits to New Zealand in 2008 and 2011 unthinkable. England's progress has brought with it greater recognition for the 44-year-old Cumbrian, an element of the job with which he is becoming increasingly comfortable. 'I don't get recognised wherever I go because I didn't have that high a profile when I was a player,' he said. 'I'm not in the public eye all the time, but it is growing with every campaign. 'The attention takes a bit of getting used to when you've never had it before, but it's always good. 'I enjoy talking to people about rugby, I love that part of the job.' Lancaster's passion for the sport extends to coaching son Daniel at West Park Leeds under-13s, with his presence on the sidelines often noticed by trophy-hunting opposition coaches. 'When I started coaching them I was England Saxons coach and none of them knew what the Saxons were,' he said. 'They were only six at the time, so they've never known any different than me coaching them. 'It's more the opposition who notice it. The local teams are used to it, it's more when you go away they think, ""Oh my God"". 'Then if we lose, their coach wants photos with his thumbs up claiming victory!' The second year of Lancaster's reign has been pockmarked by occasional criticism. Although at ease with his own media duties, Lancaster believes his future will remain on the training ground. 'I don't know what will happen next, so you never look too far ahead. But I'm most motivated by helping coaches improve as coaches,' he said. 'I enjoy working with people to help them get better and that doesn't matter if it's my son's under-13 team, or spending time with the England Under-20s or sevens. I like adding value and building teams.' Comfort zone: Lancaster is most at ease on the training pitch coaching players and building teams .","England coach spent time alone to review Six Nations .

"Felix Magath confesses to being 'afraid' as Fulham's increasingly desperate quest to secure another season in the Barclays Premier League reaches a critical point. While Magath is convinced victories over Stoke at the Britannia Stadium on Saturday and at home against Crystal Palace the following weekend will result in survival, he is still racked by nerves. The veteran German manager has never experienced relegation during his 19-year coaching career and knows Fulham are close to ending that proud record. Afraid: Magath, who has never been relegated, admits he fears failing at Fulham . 'For me, it (keeping Fulham in the Premier League) would be my most successful achievement,' the Whites boss said. 'I have never been relegated and I'm a bit afraid of the situation, I don't know how it feels to be relegated. I am afraid. 'I am always nervous, without nerves you can not bring 100 per cent. 'The mental side is always the most important thing - the players know how to kick, mentality is what we are fighting for.' Fulham are one point adrift of safety with two matches remaining and Magath accepts only two victories will clinch a 14th successive Premier League season. 'I still believe two wins will be enough,' he said. Tough times: Magath has been through a lot already in his short time at Fulham - now his side need to win . Not giving up: Magath knows Hughes (above) will not allow Stoke to let up now they are safe . 'There is no doubt, we need three points to have the chance to not be relegated. That is the situation. 'We know Stoke are a very good team at home, but we are confident that we have developed in the last few weeks and showed against Hull last weekend that we are able to play good games. 'Away from home we won at Aston Villa and we are confident we can manage it. 'The atmosphere is very good and the players want to show people we are still alive.' Both Stoke and Palace have climbed out of the relegation battle, leaving them with nothing to play for this season, but Magath denies mid-table opponents signpost an easier route to safety. 'I don't think so because if you are safe you have a lot of confidence, so it could be that their payers do better than before,' he said.","German boss says staying up would be 'most successful achievement'

"Ken Owens hopes to turn his recovery from a 'freak' neck injury into the start of his long quest for Rugby World Cup 2015 selection. The Scarlets hooker expects to be sidelined for 12 weeks after undergoing surgery to repair a prolapsed disc in his neck. The 27-year-old will miss Wales' autumn Test schedule, but is steeling himself for a makeshift pre-season as he eyes Six Nations action. Scarlets and Wales hooker Ken Owens is to see a neck specialist following an injury . The Camarthen-born front-rower battled back from a first bout of neck surgery to make Wales' 2011 World Cup squad, and is now aiming to make history repeat itself. 'It was obviously frustrating but injuries are part and parcel of rugby,' said Owens. 'It was just a freak injury towards the end of a scrummaging session in training to be honest. 'I've had it now: maybe that's one way to look at it. 'So I can get good rest, good rehab and conditioning, then the boys, some of the players will have a big couple of months of rugby leading into the Six Nations and what have you, while I'll hopefully be fresh. 'But you can never predict these things. 'In the last World Cup year, I had my neck operation in the January and thought I wouldn't be able to get back in contention for the World Cup. 'But then some of the other boys started picking up injuries towards the end of the season and I ended up going to the World Cup. Owens (left) at the 2014/2015 European Rugby Champions Cup & European Rugby Challenge Cup Launch . 'Things happen for a reason but you've got to look after your own health and wellbeing as well. 'Thankfully it is only just a 12-week injury, so hopefully I'll have chance to get back and try to get a bit of form to prove to the international selectors I deserve a spot. 'It's just part and parcel of rugby, you've just got to make sure your body's right and healthy, then look at the rest of it after that.' Owens described neck and back problems as par for rugby's front-row course, playing down the 'light shave' surgeons performed on his problem disc. The 26-cap hooker believes the increasing media spotlight in rugby's professional era accounts for a perceived rise in injury rates. 'I don't think there are more injuries,' he said. 'Rugby's more scrutinised now, there's more media interest, right across the board it's highlighted more. 'I wouldn't say there are any more injuries now than when I first started: you just hear about them. 'When one or two players pick up several injuries on the bounce I think it makes things generally sound worse than they really are. 'But we play a contact sport with big athletes playing it, and inevitably there are going to be some injuries. 'Something's got to give at the end of the day - and it tends to be necks and shoulders!'","Owens underwent surgery after a neck injury .

"Jonny Sexton helped Racing Metro to a narrow win against 2011 Heineken Cup finalists Northampton Saints. The Ireland international kicked two penalties and a conversion and had a big hand in Racing’s only try to get their European campaign started with a victory. Racing have never got out of the pool stages of Europe’s premier club cup competition but ground out a deserved win on Saturday. Jonny Sexton kicked two penalties and a conversion in Racing Metro's win over Northampton . George Pisi had Saints’ best chance to steal a victory in the second half but they will now need to beat the Ospreys at home next weekend to get their campaign back on track. Racing took the lead when Sexton pinned Saints right back in their own half with a well-struck kick. Saints lost the line-out five metres from their own line and, having shifted the ball out wide, centre Alexandre Dumoulin was bundled over. Racing Metro full back from France Brice Dulin tries to break through Northampton's defence . Northampton forward Courtney Lawes catches the ball in a line out during the clash in Paris . Outside-half Stephen Myler brought Saints back to within four points with a penalty after 30 minutes as the visitors managed to weather a period of pressure. A second Sexton penalty three minutes before the interval took Racing’s lead back to seven points but Myler again reduced the deficit with a penalty at the beginning of the second period. Racing went down to 14-men when prop Julien Brugnaut saw yellow after taking a scrum down and shortly after this, Pisi intercepted a pass and raced clear only to drop the ball 10 metres from the line because of an apparent hamstring injury. But Sexton added a penalty 11 minutes from time to secure the win for Racing at the start of the campaign.
