"(CNN) -- What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas -- unless you're Prince Harry and TMZ publishes pictures of you cavorting naked during a game of strip billiards. The tabloid website posted the photos online Tuesday night. It said the romp featuring the royal, who is third in line to the throne, took place four days earlier at a ""high rollers hotel suite"" on the Las Vegas strip. Nude Harry photos: How UK tabloids lost their sting . One photo shows Harry, stark naked but for a wristwatch and a necklace. His hands cup his genitals. His face is turned toward the television set in the suite. And his body partially shields that of another person, also naked. A second picture shows him hugging a woman from behind next to a pool table. Both are naked. Palace officials confirmed the photos are of the prince. ""Prince Harry has been on a private holiday before he resumes his military duties,"" said a palace official, declining to be named in line with protocol. Britain's Daily Telegraph newspaper website said the publication of the photographs ""risks embarrassing Buckingham Palace and raises questions about the prince's security arrangements."" The website of the Daily Mail, a middlebrow tabloid, suggested that ""Harry needed a rest after all that Olympic duty but it appears the fun may have got out of hand."" Naked Harry scandal a watershed moment for UK press . Neither website ran the photos, but the images quickly circulated worldwide, providing plenty of fodder on Twitter. ""The Queen must be sooo proud that Prince Harry showed us his crown jewels!!!! Lol,"" said Danielle Monaro, part of the Elvis Duran And The Morning Show, a syndicated radio program. The 27-year-old Harry is no stranger to controversy. In 2002, he faced accusations of under-age drinking and cannabis use. The young prince was a 16-year-old schoolboy at the time of the alleged incident . The allegations were made in the UK tabloid News of the World newspaper, which also reported his father, Prince Charles, had taken Harry to a drug rehabilitation clinic to alert him to the dangers of drug abuse. Embarrassing pics could harm a soldier's career several ways . He did not faces charges because police found no evidence to support them. In 2005, photos of Harry wearing a Nazi soldier's uniform to a fancy dress party were splashed across the front page of The Sun newspaper, accompanied by the headline ""Harry the Nazi."" He later apologized for the incident. ""I am very sorry if I caused any offense,"" Harry said. Four years later, Harry issued another apology after videos surfaced showing him using offensive language to describe members of his military unit. In one clip, a voice said to be Harry's calls a soldier a ""Paki,"" a derogatory term for people of South Asian descent. In another clip, the voice tells a soldier wearing a cloth on his head that he looks ""like a raghead,"" another offensive term for someone who wears a headdress. Now comes this latest controversy -- one that certainly gives a whole new meaning to the phrase ""hanging out."" How 'soldier prince' Harry tore up royal rule book . Harry is a captain in the Army and served briefly in Afghanistan four years ago, but was hurriedly withdrawn when news of his deployment leaked. Since then, he has qualified as an Apache helicopter pilot, doing some of his training in the United States, and is expected to deploy to Afghanistan again. A tale of two brothers .

"(CNN) -- Ahh, yes, February 15, the joyful day when singletons can finally collapse in exhaustion after weeks of maintaining a nonchalant front. Finally, you think, finally, the incessant stream of hearts and cupids and reminders that romantic partnership is the apogee of human achievement will come to a merciful end. And then you voluntarily read to the second paragraph of our weekly netiquette column, silly! That's right, we're here to take you waist-deep into that cesspool of romantic endeavors and bad decisions: online dating. Because if you survived yesterday single, you might be gunning to circumvent a repeat performance in 2013 (i.e., another year of you listening to Alanis Morissette and sobbing softly in your bedroom or, conversely, having a faux-peppy who-needs-men night with your gal pals, swilling salmon-colored drinks and shooting hateful glances at the couples in the bar). And if you're in a relationship right now, don't rest on your laurels quite yet: Breakups spike right after Cupid's big day, according to unofficial Facebook data, so you just might be back on the market soon. We've told you what not to do with your first message to a prospective date. We've told you what not to do with your photo. Yet real, live online daters continue to find bizarre and almost impressively original ways to turn us off. Read on for three totally boneheaded online dating moves we've actually encountered (AKA, weird things no one warns you about when they're persuading you to make a Match.com profile). Watching you on the street . ""Not to be creepy, but ..."" began an actual first message from an actual online dater. ""... were you sitting on a bench at such-and-such intersection at about 6:15 last night? I'm not hitting on you, I just like to think of online dating as a city-wide game of Guess Who."" Yes, we were at said corner, and we were unaware we were being watched by a peeper on the street. The incredible thing is not that said dater recognized a human from the site -- in an urban area, where folks are bumbling around in their own overlapping circles, of course you'll spot people whom you recognize from their profiles. The key is to not acknowledge it in a creepy way. (A clue that you're not adhering to that guideline: You begin a message with, ""Not to be creepy, but ..."") In this instance, for example, if the dude wanted to go on a date, he could send a friendly first message (not mentioning the unwitting run-in). Then, if things were rolling along after a few dates, he could mention it in a fun, ""You won't believe how serendipitous this was!"" kind of way. Or if he couldn't wait that long, he could send a cute Missed Connections-style message: ""I think I walked by you in Union Square yesterday! Your purple peacoat was stunning. I see you're a big fan of 'Parks & Recreation' -- have you checked out 'Party Down'?"" But just announcing, apropos of nothing, that he has superior facial recognition skills? Kind of weird. A friend told a tale of a girl he'd been messaging who eventually stopped responding. A few weeks later, a new note in his inbox: ""Hey, were you at the Caveman concert last night?"" (Indeed, he had been. Without the benefit of knowing a girl was watching him like Mel in Flight of the Conchords). If she was loving his vibes in person, she certainly could have walked up to him in between sets and said hello. But since she'd already dropped the message volley like a hot potato, probably best to let sleeping dogs snore. Another friend stopped messaging with a dude online when she got a weird feeling about him from his notes; a few weeks later, he spotted her at a Thai restaurant and marched right in. With apparent disregard for all social mores, he sat down at the table with her friends and asked when they could plan a proper date. The recommended course of action here is obvious: Since she had already rejected him online, he should've respected that and let the girl and her friends finish their pad thai in peace. Moral of these stories? Don't be scary. Online dating is nerve-racking enough when you're all squirmy-scared of rejection and awkward first-date conversations. Having to worry about weirdos jangling up to you at the supermarket? Not necessary. (Oh, and if you're the creep-ee: Block 'em on the site, or if they're approaching you in person, make an excuse and hightail it out of there. Safety first!) Revealing nothing about yourself . It's a strange power play, leaving your profile free from pictures and with only the pithiest write-ups; it says, ""You may need to advertise yourself like a heifer all gussied up for the state fair, but I ... I will make no attempt to sell myself to you. Instead,"" it tacitly blathers on, ""I will decide whether you look interesting enough for me."" Maybe that works for some people (probably those seeking the weakest and most damaged goods). Our take: Having an online dating profile and leaving it totally unpopulated just makes you look like you have no good qualities to trumpet. Oh, and sending along a photo with your first message? Still silly. How come everyone else has to show their cards from the start, while you get to keep yours close to your chest? It reeks of insecurity, a gross, musky smell reminiscent of Axe Body Spray and tears. Choosing a stupid user name . A recent German study found that people with ugly names have less success on online dating sites. Researchers came to that conclusion by tracking profile views on a gloriously German-looking dating site where users go by their real first names. But thank God you live in a country where you're free to pick your JDate handle! So why, why, why would you pick something ugly (MoldyBill) or embarrassed sounding (JustBrowzin228)? There are so very many cards stacked against you in finding love (see: a montage of your February 14), so pick a simple username, write an honest profile, and pray to the good god Eros for better luck next year.","Breakups spike right after Cupid's big day, according to unofficial Facebook data .

"(CNN) -- In the aftermath of a failed relationship, jilted lovers have been known to lash out by posting sexually explicit photos or videos of their exes online. Called ""revenge porn,"" or the less-salacious ""cyber revenge,"" the trend has been around for years, spawning entire websites that profit off these images. But now, state laws could make this illegal. Opinion: 'Revenge porn' should be a crime . This week, the California Legislature is debating a new bill that would make it a misdemeanor for people to distribute sexually explicit photos or videos they'd shot in order to cause others humiliation or distress. It has already passed the state Senate. A similar bill was under consideration in Florida this year that would have made the act a felony, but it failed to muster the votes to become law. New Jersey is the only state that already has such a law on the books. Advocate Holly Jacobs, a graduate student in Florida, began pushing for stronger laws after naked photos and videos of her were posted online that she had shared with an ex-boyfriend while they were together. The images went viral and were re-posted on hundreds of websites, along with identifying details such as her name, e-mail address and employer. Jacobs suspects her ex was responsible, although she told CNN that he has denied any involvement. She spent years fighting to get the images removed from various websites. A gray area . The reason it was so difficult is that these acts of vengeance frequently fall into a gray legal area. In California, very few variations of revenge are already covered under state law. If a subject is under 18, such an act is covered by child pornography laws. It's already illegal to shoot a video or photograph secretly of someone without permission anywhere there's a reasonable expectation of privacy -- in a bedroom or a store dressing room, for example, but not in a public park or on the street. However, these laws don't apply in most ""revenge porn"" situations, where the injured party gave permission to be photographed or videotaped during happier times. There are cyberstalking statutes, but they require a pattern of behavior (multiple offenses) and implied threats that make the victim fear for his or her safety. Uploading a single nude photo to embarrass an ex wouldn't apply. As a final recourse, the man or woman shown in an explicit video could pursue a civil case against their ex or the sites hosting the images, but those cases can be costly and difficult to win. The California bill, Senate Bill 255, targets anyone who photographs or records a sexual image with consent and then ""subsequently distributes the image taken, with the intent to cause serious emotional distress, and the other person suffers serious emotional distress."" Under the new law, distributing these types of videos and photos would become a misdemeanor, punishable by up to six months in jail or a $1,000 fine for first violation. A second offense could result in a year in jail and a $2,000 fine. The perpetrator would not become a registered sex offender. ""This is a very precisely drafted and narrowly drafted bill,"" said UCLA law professor Eugene Volokh. Legal pitfalls . The California bill is so narrow, in fact, that it doesn't cover one of the more common revenge-porn situations: images originally shared through sexting. The law only applies when someone is the both the person who shoots the original image and the one who distributes it. If someone takes a photo of himself or herself, texts it to a girlfriend or boyfriend, and then the recipient later posts it, that act wouldn't be considered a crime under this legislation. Critics such as the American Civil Liberties Union have also expressed concerns about the bill, arguing such a law could have a negative impact on free speech. ""It's possible in extremely unusual situations that this kind of speech might have serious value -- you can imagine a political context or a video that reveals something criminal,"" Volokh said. There are other potential holes, such as when images are distributed for bragging rights or money instead of revenge. ""It does require intent to cause serious emotional distress,"" Volokh said of the bill. ""In certain situations, the reason people distribute this material is for money."" Once an image is online it can spread quickly. The bitter ex could be charged with a crime, but getting websites to take down the image would still be a separate battle. The hope is that making distributing the images a crime will deter people from pursuing this type of revenge in the first place.","California debates a law that would make posting what's known as ""revenge porn"" illegal .

"(CNN) -- Valerie Wood-Harber's brother, Quinten, needed a lot of special care. He was born with a rare chromosomal abnormality, which meant even as a teenager, he needed help doing things that most people take for granted. Getting dressed could be a challenge. So could eating. But Quinten was also a happy child, who loved water, hugs and the music duo Daft Punk, his sister said. He smiled and laughed about everything. ""Honestly, my biggest worry about him was that he was going to outlive the people that were able to take care of him,"" said Wood-Harber. ""That was my biggest fear. He was healthy."" Quinten Douglas Wood, 15, died on January 4. A medical examiner's report lists his cause of death as acute pneumonia. The manner of death was ruled natural. Despite the report, Wood-Harber, 28, says she has questions, and she's not alone. Wood-Harber has started an online petition, calling for the governor to investigate schools and the Oklahoma Department of Human Services over her brother's death, which she says was caused by negligence. More than 250,000 people have signed it. Quinten passed away less than a month after Wood-Harber says she called DHS to report their father, who took care of Quinten and the boy's younger brother in Oklahoma City. Wood-Harber lives in Fayetteville, Arkansas. In keeping with its policy following the death of a child when there is an open or pending referral, DHS initiated an investigation. The department is working alongside the Oklahoma City Police Department, the Oklahoma Commission on Children and Youth, the Oklahoma Medical Examiner's Office and The Children's Hospital. Their investigations are ongoing. The goal is to find out exactly what happened, said Sheree Powell, director of communications and community relations at DHS. Who knew what and when? And what, if anything, could have been done to prevent Quinten's death? ""I think the biggest thing we would like to emphasize right now is just how heartbreaking this whole situation is and that we're working very, very diligently to try to find justice for this boy,"" Powell said. 'Wouldn't live to see a year' When his son was born, Michael Wood says that doctors thought he wouldn't live to be a year old. Unlike his daughter, he recalled the various health problems his son suffered. Wood, 47, said Quinten had so many ear infections that antibiotics rarely worked. He had been hospitalized at least nine times with pneumonia, and each time took its toll, he said. A single working dad, Wood needed help to care for his disabled son. He said he went to DHS three times, starting in 2010, to ask for it. ""They bounced me to another department, and they said well, somebody will come out. And nobody ever came out,"" Wood said. ""I finally said, forget it, I'll do it on my own."" ""I'm not real big on every time I have a problem, go to somebody else to fix it,"" he said. Powell, with DHS, declined to comment on whether Wood had ever approached the department and if so, what happened. That sort of information, if it exists, would be included in a report DHS plans to issue at the end of its investigation. Without help at home, the responsibilities of feeding and changing Quinten fell to his other son when Wood was at work. The brothers were only a year apart and best friends. They were together when Quinten died. Their father left work early that day because he felt under the weather. Already sick, Quinten's brother was home from school. ""I was going to take both of them to the doctor that afternoon,"" Wood said. Quinten stopped breathing before he got the chance. His father started CPR and told his other son to call 911. Quinten was transported to The Children's Hospital, where he was pronounced dead shortly after arrival. ""As a parent, no matter how your kid dies, you feel guilt,"" said Wood. ""Would he have been alive if I'd taken him to the doctor the day before? Probably, maybe not, I don't know. People die of pneumonia in the hospital."" He said he thinks about things he could have done differently. He wishes he'd spent every second with Quinten that he could. But sometimes, life gives you a bad hand, and there's nothing you can do. ""There are some people that when they're hurting, they have to put blame somewhere. Personally, I was raised a Christian, and personally I put the blame on God,"" said Wood. He lashed out at his daughter and others who say he wasn't a good father. ""If I didn't care properly for Quinten, he wouldn't have lived 15 years, especially when we were told that he wouldn't live to see a year."" 'The system, it doesn't work' Wood-Harber says she 100% believes that her brother would be alive if her father had taken better care of Quinten. But, in her mind, others are responsible for his death as well. Parents might fail, but that's why there are agencies in place to pick up the slack. Specifically, she said she told teachers and administrators at the boys' schools -- Jarman Middle School and Midwest City High -- to be on the lookout for signs of potential abuse or neglect. She thinks they failed to notice Quinten lost a substantial amount of weight. ""They're called mandatory reporters for a reason. If you even suspect something is going on, you're supposed to report it,"" said Wood-Harber. Stacey Boyer, director of community relations and records management at Mid-Del Schools, which includes both of the boys' schools, declined to comment on the case, citing privacy laws. She said no one from the Wood family has contacted the Mid-Del Board of Education. Besides the schools, Wood-Harber blames DHS and the police. She says she called to report her father to DHS on December 17. A worker went to interview Quinten and his brother at their schools almost immediately, she said. The worker promised to make a home visit the next day, but never showed up, and stopped returning her calls, according to Wood-Harber, who says she also reached out to police. The Oklahoma City Police Department received a report from an anonymous caller on December 17, requesting that officers check on Quinten and his brother, said Sgt. Jennifer Wardlow. Officers checked the home, but there was no answer at the door. No report was generated. Not 'just a cautionary tale' Far away and frustrated, Wood-Harber considered at one point just going to Oklahoma City and taking the boys. ""Of course if I could trade a pair of handcuffs, and sitting in a jail cell serving time for kidnapping, for my brother being alive, I would do it in a heartbeat. But at the same time, I know that with the resources and the information that I had at my disposal, I did everything that I could. ""I relied on the system to work, and that's just the problem. The system, it doesn't work. It's very much broken,"" she said. Wood-Harber started a petition at Change.org, which has so far collected more than 250,000 signatures. In it, she calls for the governor of Oklahoma to investigate DHS and the schools. She hopes it will help ensure that what happened to Quinten won't happen to another child. ""This isn't just a cautionary tale. We could actually change things and prevent this from happening on a larger scale,"" she said. Alex Weintz, a spokesman for Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin, told CNN that her office was aware of the petition and monitoring its progress. The governor's staff has requested more information from DHS. In the meantime, Quinten's sister says she'll continue speaking out about her brother, and on behalf of other children. ""That's the only way that I can make sense of it. Maybe if what happened to Quinten can save somebody else's life, then there'll be a little bit of justice in this world,"" she said. CNN's Kevin Conlon contributed to this report.","Quinten Douglas Wood, 15, died on January 4 .

"(CNN) -- Humanitarian organizations have been unable to meet the ""massive needs"" of civilians facing brutal attacks in northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, a medical aid group said Wednesday. Hundreds of thousands of Congolese have been displaced by years of violence in the region. Extreme violence against civilians is spreading from Haut-Uele into Bas-Uele, as well as into neighboring southern Sudan and eastern Central African Republic, according to the international humanitarian organization Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders). The civilian population in that region has been the target of attacks by the Ugandan rebel group the Lord's Resistance Army, known as LRA, and the Ugandan and Congolese offensive against the LRA, the doctors organization said in a news release. Hundreds of thousands of civilians have fled. The organization said it has more than 150 people working in the Haut-Uele and Bas-Uele districts, where it has provided help to about 16,000 displaced people and treated thousands of patients. ""The local population is the target of violence: murder, kidnapping and sexual abuse,"" said Luis Encinas, coordinator of Medecins Sans Frontieres operations in Central Africa. ""We are talking about tactics of violence aimed at instilling fear in the people. Our patients have told us the most brutal stories -- about children who are forced to kill their parents and people burnt alive inside their homes."" To the south, a joint operation has been waged since January by the Congolese army and Rwandan troops against the Rwandan Hutu militia Democratic Liberation Forces of Rwanda. On Tuesday, 84 humanitarian and human rights groups in the Congo Advocacy Coalition spoke out against the operation in eastern Congo, known as Kimia II and backed by U.N. peacekeepers since March. The operation has resulted in an ""unacceptable cost"" for the civilian population, the coalition said. Since the action began, more than 1,000 civilians have been killed and 7,000 women and girls have been raped, the coalition said. Some of the militia leaders participated in the genocide in Rwanda in 1994, member groups said in a report on the Human Rights Watch Web site. Sexual violence has grown increasingly brutal in the Kimia II operation, one observer said. ""We're seeing more cases of mutilation, extreme violence and torture in sexual violence cases against women and girls, and many more of the victims are children,"" said Immaculee Birhaheka of Promotion et Appui aux Initiatives Feminines (Promotion and Support of Women's Initiatives). More than 6,000 homes have been burned down in the provinces of North and South Kivu, the coalition said. Nearly 900,000 people have been forced to flee their homes and live in desperate conditions with host families, in forests or in displacement camps with limited access to food and medicine, it said. The American Association for the Advancement of Science says satellite imagery shows that in Busurungi, one of the main towns in North Kivu, and the surrounding 100 square kilometers (about 260 square miles), 1,494 homes and structures have been destroyed, some as recently as September. That is a destruction rate of about 80 percent. U.N. peacekeepers have provided millions of dollars worth in tactical expertise, transport and aviation support, food rations, fuel and medical supplies to Congolese army soldiers. ""Despite such support, U.N. peacekeepers have not used their leverage to get the government to remove commanders with known track records of human rights abuses from participating in the operations,"" the coalition said. ""The human rights and humanitarian consequences of the current military operation are simply disastrous,"" said Marcel Stoessel of Oxfam, a coalition member. ""U.N. peacekeepers, who have a mandate to protect civilians, urgently need to work with government forces to make sure civilians get the protection they need, or discontinue their support,"" he said. According to the coalition, 3,000 additional U.N. peacekeepers authorized by the U.N. Security Council in November are just arriving, and helicopters and other support has not materialized. After the Rwandan and Congolese governments began their joint campaign against the Democratic Liberation Forces of Rwanda, ""no provisions were made for the protection of civilians, despite the FDLR's long and brutal track record of attacking defenseless communities when provoked,"" said John Prendergast, co-founder of the Enough Project. Enough, a project of the Center for American Progress, works to end genocide and crimes against humanity.","Rebel groups target civilians in northeastern section of country .

"(CNN) -- Stanislas Wawrinka used to refer to himself as ""the Swiss tennis player who loses."" But no longer. While the 29-year-old has spent most of his career in the shadow of his friend Roger Federer, the most successful male player of the modern era, the 2014 season has brought a new world order. Not only has Wawrinka won his maiden major at January's Australian Open -- earning him the new moniker of ""Grand Slam Stan"" -- but he has now ticked off another box after claiming his first Masters title. The celebrations were muted on Sunday as he and Federer hugged over the net in Monte Carlo, but deep inside Wawrinka was buzzing after coming from behind to triumph 4-6 7-6 (7-5) 6-2 against the 17-time grand slam champion. Such is their close relationship, it had been dubbed ""the friendly final"" as Federer went into the match with a 13-1 advantage in their meetings. ""It's amazing for me. It's always special to play against Roger, my best friend and the best player ever. It's always difficult to play him, especially in the final,"" Wawrinka told CNN World Sport after claiming the $550,000 first prize. The 1,000 ranking points that came with it will put him top of the Race to London standings for the season-ending championships. ""I'm really, really happy with my match today. I did a great job and I'm enjoying it a lot,"" added Wawrinka, who received the trophy from Monaco's Prince Albert and Princess Charlene. Not only did he beat his Davis Cup teammate, on Saturday the world No. 3 also defeated sixth seed David Ferrer -- who upset top-ranked Rafael Nadal in the quarterfinals. ""I'm really confident with my game. I know that I can beat all the players,"" said Wawrinka, who appeared to step up a gear after a brief rain delay at 3-2 up in the second set. ""I did an amazing job this week, beating some amazing players. Physically, when I'm at my best, I have a chance to beat all those guys. ""I'm going to enjoy this, I think that's important. It feels great, winning on clay, winning against Roger, it's really special."" With Nadal's invincibility on clay seemingly having slipped a little, and second-ranked Novak Djokovic awaiting a scan on the injured wrist that hampered him in Saturday's semifinal defeat by Federer, it leaves the way open for Wawrinka to contemplate further success at the upcoming French Open. Federer's participation at Roland Garros is in some doubt as he awaits the birth of his third child, but the former world No. 1 can take some heart from his showing in the principality despite losing the final there for the fourth time. ""Of course, I'm very happy for Stan,"" the 32-year-old told reporters. ""To take the opportunities when they're there, that's key in a tennis player's career. ""I think it's one of the those finals that I could have won. But Stan was tougher at the end. I think he deserved it just a little bit more."" Meanwhile, Germany will face the Czech Republic in the final of the women's Fed Cup teams competition in November. The Germans will contest the title match for the first time in 22 years after taking an unassailable 3-0 lead against Australia in Brisbane on Sunday as Angelique Kerber beat former U.S. Open champion Samantha Stosur 4-6 6-0 6-4. The home team then won the dead doubles rubber, as Kerber and teammate Andrea Petkovic prepared for the long flight back home for this week's WTA Tour event in Stuttgart. The Czechs crushed defending champions Italy 4-0, with former Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova clinching a home final as she won the third singles rubber 6-3 7-5 against Roberta Vinci. Klara Koukalova and Andrea Hlavackova then won the doubles, avenging last year's 3-1 semifinal defeat by Italy. Also on Sunday, Croatia's Donna Vekic became the youngest player to win a WTA Tour title in eight years as she upset Australian Open runner-up Dominika Cibulkova at the Malaysian Open. The 17-year-old won 5-7 7-5 7-6 (7-4) against the top seed in her third top-level final. She is two months older than Vania King was when the American won a 2006 tournament in Bangkok.","Stanislas Wawrinka denies Roger Federer his first title in Monte Carlo .

"(CNN) -- Rapper Gucci Mane was charged in federal court Tuesday with two counts of possessing a firearm as a felon after two September incidents during which he showed a gun and threatened police, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia. Reports at the time indicated that the ""Lemonade"" rhymer was arrested in Atlanta on September 14 after a friend flagged down police to say he was concerned about the rapper's behavior. After Gucci Mane became ""increasingly agitated"" and threatened officers, police said, he was taken into custody and charged with disorderly conduct, marijuana possession and carrying a handgun. The federal prosecutor's news release indicates, however, that there were two incidents in September, two days apart and on the same week that Atlantic Records reportedly dropped Gucci Mane, 33, whose real name is Radric Davis. ""On September 12, 2013, Davis, who was a felon at the time, was found in possession of a firearm,"" the release said. ""Then, just two days later, on September 14th, he again possessed a firearm different from the earlier gun. On both occasions, Davis displayed the loaded firearm, acted erratically, and made threats to individuals, including police and his attorney."" Atlanta police and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, who are investigating the incident, applauded the arrest. Atlanta Police Chief George Turner said in a statement, ""We cannot tolerate convicted felons ignoring the law by carrying firearms and endangering our citizens."" Added U.S. Attorney Sally Quillian Yates, ""This is how people get hurt, and we are committed to ensuring that convicted felons not have guns."" A federal grand jury indicted Davis on November 19. He made an initial appearance before Magistrate Judge Linda T. Walker and was detained in custody pending trial. Each charge of being a felon in possession of a firearm carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. In March, Davis was arrested for hitting a man over the head with a champagne bottle at an Atlanta nightclub. The man told police the incident occurred after he tried to strike up a conversation with the rapper. In 2010, he was arrested in Atlanta for violating a number of traffic laws, but the charges were dismissed. In 2005, Davis was charged with murder in the shooting death of a man, but the charge was dropped because of insufficient evidence.","Rapper was charged with 2 counts of being a felon in possession of a firearm .

"(CNN) -- Tom Perkins, a well-known venture capitalist, got himself in hot water when he compared the ""progressive war on the 1%"" with Nazis' treatment of Jews in World War II. Although Perkins apologized for his comments, he stood by his main point that anger at the rich is a wrong and dangerous attitude. It's easy to dismiss Perkins' sentiment as nothing more than the ill-advised ravings of a cantankerous, thin-skinned old man. But it also illustrates just how bizarre things have gotten for some wealthy people, who find themselves in a new socially constructed category and on the wrong side of a resurgent but elusive political ideal, facing off against mesmerizing populist adversaries. How can the ""1%"" make the best of the situation they're in and reduce the likelihood of more embarrassing Perkins-like incidents? Here's my advice. First, remember that the 1% is an almost meaningless moniker for a multifarious bunch of people who differ greatly in political leaning, wealth, occupation and ethics. Yes, you are luckier, better educated and perhaps a little bit smarter than the rest, but that hardly makes you a monolithic class. And while there are certainly scoundrels, sociopaths, wealth addicts and Ayn Rand-devotees in your midst, these bad apples are far from the norm despite the attention they garner. You're really just like everybody else, only richer. However, as ""welfare moms,"" ""urban youth"" and ""unionized teachers"" have long since discovered, resistance is futile once a pejorative new category bursts onto the scene. And you'll only make things worse by trying to introduce something better (Perkins tried ""successful 1%,"" which is even more objectionable because it implies the ""unsuccessful 99%""). So you're stuck with the 1% label. But rather than wax nostalgic for the honorific categories of yesteryear - ""global elite,"" ""electronic herd"" and ""mass affluent"" -- try to remember that ""sticks and stones may break your bones but names will never hurt you"" while waiting calmly for the rhetorical storm to pass. And please don't succumb to self-pity for suffering the indignity of guilt by association; name-calling is nothing like stop-and-frisk, job discrimination or profiling. Toughen up! Second, for all the easy talk about reducing inequality, its corollary -- equality -- is the most complex and controversial social ideal. Is it equality of opportunity or income? At a moment in time or across generations? Why is it important over and above the goal of helping those at the bottom? But what makes equality difficult to define philosophically makes it expedient politically, because its vagueness and complexity allow it to be offered as a panacea for almost any problem. Just accept that while it's possible to be pro-gun or pro-choice, it's impossible to be pro-inequality. And when cornered at a cocktail party, please don't ask opponents to tell you what equality really means or to offer a coherent explanation of its causes and effects. Equality is the zeitgeist for a period when many people feel under pressure and shafted by a system that they think you represent. If you sympathize, show it. If you don't, keep your mouth shut. Third, you need a grass-roots strategy for dealing with Elizabeth Warren, Bill de Blasio and the other emerging populist rock stars. It simply won't do to continue relying on the octogenarian trinity -- Warren Buffett, George Soros and John Bogle -- to be your friendly faces. Nor can the job be outsourced to Third Way staffers or lefty celebrities. To meet the populist media challenge will take some courage by a younger generation of 1% Democrats with charisma and a willingness to seek common ground with the populists even though by doing so they'll be viewed by many friends and colleagues as traitors to their class. Rather than put your head in the sand or stay safely in the limousine, get out there and make your case in the street, on TV, in bars and on the Internet. But be realistic, for in the current environment the best you can do may be to get yourselves thought of as humble, competent people on a level with dentists. Finally, be invigorated by this moment in the spotlight! You have status to engage politically simply by virtue of your membership in a category - the 1% - that did not even exist until 2011. But political winds are fickle and may soon blow you off the stage. As Oscar Wilde said, ""the only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.""

"(CNN) -- Police are investigating after two UNICEF staff members went missing in Karachi, Pakistan, a United Nations spokesman said Sunday. The staffers went missing on Thursday evening, United Nations spokesman Vittorio Cammarota said. Police are in close contact with the UNICEF employees' families, he said. The port city of Karachi is Pakistan's financial capital. On Saturday, gunmen wounded a prominent Pakistani TV news anchor there. His brother linked the attack to the nation's government, drawing a denial from military officials. Hamid Mir was shot three times by gunmen in a car and on two motorcycles near Karachi's airport, his network Geo News -- a CNN affiliate -- reported. Amir Mir -- the targeted news anchor's brother and a journalist himself -- said his brother believed ISI, Pakistan's powerful intelligence agency, had plans to assassinate him. The Pakistani military public relations agency ISPR said that ""raising allegations against ISI or the head of ISI without any basis is highly regrettable and misleading."" In the same statement, a spokesman for that agency condemned the attack and ""prayed for (Mir's) well-being and quick recovery.""

"(CNN) -- Once again, the news from Afghanistan fills us with sadness and suggests that perhaps we should despair, that maybe it's time to give up hope for the country. On Thursday morning, an Afghan guard allegedly opened fire at the gates of a hospital in Kabul, killing three Americans, including Chicago pediatrician Jerry Umanos and a father and son, also doctors, visiting the medical facility. Civilians have suffered the brunt of Afghanistan's decades of turmoil, but when the killers target aid workers, people who have left their lives behind to come and help, their message is loud and painfully clear: ""Go away!"" In the anger, frustration and heartbreak that follow these attacks, I've heard it many times, people declare: ""That's it. It's time to leave."" In today's incident, the guard opened fire on a group of five doctors as they walked from the gate to the building housing the hospital run by CURE International, a Christian charity that says it came to Afghanistan in 2005 at the invitation of the Afghan government. CURE says it treats patients without regard to religion, gender or ability to pay. The hospital specializes in child and maternity care. Umanos had worked in Afghanistan since 2005. His colleagues say he loved the country. In addition to treating Afghan patients, Umanos helped train Afghan physicians, a key requirement for building a country that eventually can become independent and self-sustaining. Attacks against foreigners have been on the rise in Afghanistan. Earlier this month, two journalists from The Associated Press were shot. Photographer Anja Niedringhaus was killed. In January, a Taliban suicide bomber blew himself up in a restaurant popular with foreigners, killing 21 people, most of them expatriates working for the local university, the United Nations, and the International Monetary Fund -- all trying to help Afghanistan rebuild. Last month, Taliban gunmen burst into the restaurant in Kabul's Serena Hotel, killing nine people, including women, children and several foreigners, some in the country as international observers for the April 5 presidential elections. What to do? There is no more difficult decision for a humanitarian organization than pulling up stakes under fire. It's a choice each group makes considering its own circumstances, just as individuals choose how much risk to take for a cause they believe worthwhile; just as news executives anxiously decide how close to the line of fire to send their journalists. You could hear the pain in the voices of Doctors Without Borders (MSF) leaders last year, for example, when the group announced it was leaving Somalia after 22 years as ""a direct result of extreme attacks on our staff,"" occurring while, the organization said, civilian leaders were tolerating and condoning the killing and kidnapping of aid workers. Over the course of more than two decades, MSF staff had endured enormous risks. But, they said, ""We have now reached our limit."" What makes these decisions particularly difficult is that they victimize the people who suffer the most and they reward the brutality of perpetrators, people who blow up schools, shoot doctors, and massacre civilians. The latest tragedy in Kabul will undoubtedly prompt emergency meetings and anguished soul searching. Organizations working in Afghanistan will weigh the desperate needs of the Afghan people against the dangerous reality for their workers. Some may pull out. Others will strengthen security, while conscious that the latest victims were killed by their supposed protectors. There is no shame in leaving or cutting back. But there is one thought all who have worked in Afghanistan should keep in mind. There is one point that those who have been hurt there and the families of those who died in Afghanistan should always remember: It has not been in vain. Afghanistan is still a place where terrible things happen, and it is a country with a long and steep road ahead. But it is not what it once was. At the turn of the century, Afghanistan was a ruin of a state, a maelstrom of suffering ruled by the Taliban, who were succeeding in their effort to move their country to their pre-medieval ideal. The ""government"" held public executions, often by stoning, in the local stadium. Afghanistan had become an international terrorist base, a place where modernity and freedom were banished. In 1998, Physicians for Human Rights described Kabul as ""a city of beggars,"" where women who had been doctors and nurses and teachers moved through the streets ""like ghosts"" in their all-enveloping Burkas selling everything they owned to feed their children. PHR declared the Taliban's threat to women's rights as ""unparalleled in recent history."" Today, the Health Minister who described the attack to CNN is a woman, as are other cabinet members. Women can be found -- albeit in small numbers -- in most sectors of the country. And, incredibly, Afghanistan surprised even itself with a successful presidential election on April 5. The results won't be known for a few weeks, a second round of voting will likely follow, but the verdict from the people is in with enormous force. Despite threats from the Taliban to punish anyone who participated, despite terrible or nonexistent roads and awful weather, Afghans went to the polls by the millions. One member of Parliament, Shukria Barakzai, told CNN, ""As much as they killed our children, our journalists and innocent women, we say now, we will go and vote. ... We want to see real change."" The next president, elected by the men and women of Afghanistan, will face a mountain of overwhelmingly difficult challenges. And he will do it while American troops pull out. He, and the people of Afghanistan, will continue to need help against individuals who are willing to shoot doctors to keep foreigners out, throw acid in girls' faces to keep them from going to school, and massacre civilians in order to take power. There is no doubt that we will hear more sad news from Afghanistan. More people will die. But we should remember that those who have sacrificed have done it for something important, worthy. They have alleviated suffering and helped bring the prospect of a lasting, better future for the people of Afghanistan. It's no time to despair.","Three American doctors killed by Afghan guard at Kabul hospital .

"(CNN) -- Not long ago, attending international oil and gas conferences, East Africa was the graveyard session. All the smart money was on the Gulf of Guinea and I and a few other analysts would sit through almost empty sessions more out of courtesy than curiosity. No longer, East Africa is the new oil and gas frontier, and the meetings are packed. Three statements released in March by international oil and gas companies prospecting in Eastern Africa demonstrate this - a fourth impressive gas find in Tanzania by BG Group and London-listed Ophir Energy saw their shares soar. Italian energy company ENI also announced new gas reserves in Mozambique, and Anglo-Irish Tullow Oil, announced an oil discovery in Kenya, that ""is beyond our expectations and bodes well for the material programme ahead of us."" How times have changed. Kenya's President Mwai Kibaki, couldn't contain his excitement on 26 March and interrupted a scheduled speech to announce the find by Tullow in the country's north-western Turkana region. You could feel his relief as he called it a ""major breakthrough"". Ever since independence Kenyans officials have been wondering why their geology has been less generous than others, and in recent years the pressure has been on, gold, Tanzanite and now significant gas finds in Tanzania and oil in Uganda. Read more: Oil discovered in Kenya . Kenya has a strong agribusiness base, exporting tea, coffee, flowers and vegetables. It also enjoys a major tourism industry and Nairobi is a regional hub, providing financial and other services and is a continent leader on telephone banking. If significant oil reserves are found, this could be transformative for its economy. It will also embolden Kenya, that has ambitions to become a leading regional power, but as a columnist in Kenya's Business Daily wrote, 'Kenya's economic and diplomatic clout had largely suffered from a lack of known natural resources that are of strategic importance to the rest of the world'. Kenya's politicians will need to keep a close eye on this, as regional co-operation within the East African Community rather than head-on competition makes better economic sense. Kenya has already been positioning itself to develop regional oil facilities for exports of oil from Uganda and South Sudan. Work started in March on building a huge deep-water port in Lamu, to service a pipeline across northern Kenya to connect to the port. The West sees Kenya as a regional anchor state although its reputation as a stable democracy, took a knocking with the surge of violence that followed the presidential elections in 2008. New presidential elections are scheduled late 2012 or 2013, and oil will additionally raise anticipation of the spoils of billions of future oil dollars for the victorious. The stakes in these elections have just risen, and the resilience of Kenya's institutions to ensure a fair election, but also its politicians to gracefully accept defeat is critical. President Kibaki, himself will not be running and has a golden opportunity to secure his legacy by working tirelessly to ensure credible and peaceful elections take place. See also: Ghana's oil discovery: blessing or curse? The greatest worry about oil finds in Kenya is that oil money might further blight an already corrupted political class that many Kenyans complain about. Kenya has a poor reputation for corruption, especially by its political class. A former anti-corruption tsar, John Gitongo fled the country in 2005, fearing for his life and lived in exile in Britain. He returned to Kenya in 2008 and has set up Kenya Ni Yetu (Kenya is Ours), a campaign aimed at mobilizing ordinary people to speak up against corruption, impunity and injustice. If Kenya is to effectively benefit from oil, and avoid the resource curse that many other oil producers have experienced it needs to learn from the mistakes of others. The lessons are clear, strengthen independent institutions and oversight; publish all the taxes and royalties from oil; do not rush into prestige projects and extravagant consumption and don't neglect creating meaningful employment for Kenyans. Kenyans need jobs, but the oil industry itself never employs many. The key is to use any oil funds, to build up a competitive economy - Kenya's luck is that it already has a successful base from which to build from. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Alex Vines .","Alex Vines, an expert on Africa says East Africa is becoming the new oil and gas frontier .

"(CNN) -- In his first television interview, Ariel Castro's son said Monday that his dad belongs in prison for the rest of his life and he doesn't plan on ever visiting him. Last week, Ariel Castro pleaded guilty in an Ohio court to 937 counts, including murder and kidnapping, in connection with imprisoning three women in his home for nearly a decade. Castro is set to be sentenced Thursday. A plea deal he agreed to recommends that he get life in prison without parole. The deal would allow Castro to avoid the death penalty. Read more: Ariel Castro agrees to plea deal . Anthony Castro, in an exclusive NBC ""Today"" show interview, said he thinks that sentence is ""the best possible."" ""I think that if he really can't control his impulses and he really doesn't have any value for human life, the way this case has shown, then behind bars is where he belongs for the rest of his life,"" the son said. NBC's Savannah Guthrie asked the son what he would have thought about his father receiving the death penalty. ""It would've been tough to accept just because death penalty cases are ... you end up in court a lot ... and so they come back a lot more often. I think this way is a lot better, because, you know, he's put himself away, and he will be away for the rest of his life,"" Castro responded. Anthony Castro went on to say that his father ""has been lying to his family for the past 10, 11 years, at every possible turn."" ""I have no trust in him,"" the son said. ""I can't see myself going to visit him and giving him the opportunity to face me and lie to me again."" The abductions and escape . Castro abducted Michelle Knight, Amanda Berry and Georgina ""Gina"" DeJesus separately in a two-year period starting in 2002, authorities say. Snapshots: Who are the three women? The women and Berry's 6-year-old daughter were held in Castro's 1,400-square-foot home. DNA tests have confirmed that Castro is the child's father. They were freed in May after one of the women shouted for help while Castro was away. Neighbor Charles Ramsey said he heard their cries as he was sitting down to eat. ""I see this girl going nuts trying to get out of a house,"" he told CNN affiliate WEWS. ""I go on the porch and she says, 'Help me get out. I've been in here a long time.' "" Finally free, Berry pleaded for a phone. ""Help me, I am Amanda Berry,"" she frantically told a 911 operator. ""I've been kidnapped, and I've been missing for 10 years. And I'm here, I'm free now."" Thankful for support . Lately the women have spoken out. In early July, Berry, DeJesus and Knight released a YouTube video offering their thanks to all those who have helped them since they were freed. ""I want to thank everyone who has helped me and my family through this entire ordeal. Everyone who has been there to support us has been a blessing,"" Berry said in the video. ""I'm getting stronger each day."" DeJesus talked to CNN affiliate WEWS on Sunday. She was excited that the last pieces of wood were being placed on a privacy fence around the DeJesus home. ""I really wanted it. It meant a lot to me,"" the young woman said. ""The difference is privacy, of her being able to come out, walk out and do what she wants."" DeJesus' grandmother Nancy Ruiz told the station. The fence was donated. Also over the weekend, Berry surprised concert-goers in Cleveland when she took the stage with family and friends and waved to a cheering crowd. Rapper Nelly dedicated his hit song, ""Just a Dream,"" to her, HLN reported. Happiness gives way to disappointment . The news of the women's freedom initially made Anthony Castro happy, he said on NBC on Monday. He was like many in Ohio familiar with their longstanding disappearances. But when his father's name and photo made media reports, and he heard Berry say his father's name, he was stunned and shaken. ""I was shocked because of the magnitude of such a crime,"" Anthony Castro said. ""I don't think I can imagine anyone doing that, let alone to find out it was my own flesh and blood, my father. However, I did grow up in a house with a lot of fear and a lot of violence. And so, the fact that this was a violent case, no, it didn't surprise me."" Guthrie pointed out that Anthony Castro has spoken out about abuse that he and his mother suffered at the hands of his father. Ariel Castro was ""incredibly strict,"" Anthony Castro said. ""He had a temper. He wasn't a monster 24/7, but if you crossed him, there would be consequences. And those, more often than not, would be physical consequences. ""I remember crying myself to sleep when I was a kid because my legs were covered in welts from belts. Seeing my mom getting beat up in our own home, and no one should ever have to see their mom crumpled up in a corner on the floor the way I did so many times."" In a way, his father's imprisonment is a kind of justice for his mother, he said. ""I think that she will be there the first morning he wakes up in prison ... and the sun shines down -- that's going to be her justice."" Mixed emotions: horror, gratefulness . Had Anthony Castro been inside the house where the women were held? Had he seen any signs? Anthony Castro had been in the house, and he always entered through the back door. ""That's where my father would flag me in,"" he said. There were locks on the doors to the attic and basement, and the windows were nailed shut, Anthony Castro said. But that wasn't unusual. There were places he just wasn't allowed to go, he said. But he and his dad would talk in the kitchen for a short while, he said. His family has endured a ""nightmare"" since May, Anthony Castro said, but he was quick to add, ""nothing to compare to what the girls went through."" ""What's horrifying is I have the same first and last name,"" he said. ""I look in the mirror and I see the resemblance and I think about what he did and how horrible it was, and I just can't help sometimes just being overcome."" Anthony Castro wants his friends and co-workers to know that's he's grateful that they've supported him. ""Because of all this, my father will never be able to hurt anyone again,"" he said. ""I have nothing to say to him.""","Anthony Castro recalls Ariel Castro abusing him and his mother .

"(CNN) -- A high school senior who sued her mother and father for financial support and college tuition dropped the lawsuit Tuesday, according to a decision by a Superior Court judge in Morristown, New Jersey. Rachel Canning, 18, who returned home and reunited with her parents in Lincoln Park a week ago, appeared in court and testified that she decided to dismiss her complaint. Judge Peter A. Bogaard ruled that Canning's ""decision to dismiss the litigation was a knowing and voluntary decision."" Canning's parents, Sean and Elizabeth, also were in court. Canning alleged in her lawsuit that her parents forced her out of their home and that she was unable to support herself financially. The lawsuit asked that her parents pay the remaining tuition for her last semester at her private high school, pay her current living and transportation expenses, commit to paying her college tuition and reimburse her friend's parents for legal fees. Her parents said Rachel left home because she didn't want to obey their rules. A judge denied the teenager's request for high school tuition and current living expenses from her parents two weeks ago, and a date had been set for April on the other issues in the lawsuit. Canning, an honor student and cheerleader at Morris Catholic High School in Denville, said in court documents that she had to leave her parents' home because of emotional and psychological mistreatment. She alleged, among other things, that her mother called her ""fat"" and ""porky"" and that her father threatened to beat her. Canning was suspended from school for truancy in October, according to court documents filed by her parents' former attorney, Laurie Rush-Masuret. Her parents told the teen that she could no longer see her boyfriend, who was also suspended from school. Car and phone privileges were also taken away. Once she learned of the punishment, Canning cut school again and then decided to run away, her father said in court documents. After receiving allegations that Rachel was being abused, New Jersey's Division of Child Protection and Permanency interviewed the teen, her parents and her two younger sisters, but it ultimately ""determined that allegation of emotional abuse was unfounded,"" a letter from the agency states. CNN's requests for comment from Tanya Helfand, the attorney representing the younger Canning in the lawsuit, were not returned Tuesday. A request for comment from John Inglesino, whose family had been paying Rachel's legal fees and housing her for the past four months, also was unanswered. Angelo Sarno, the attorney representing Canning's parents, said in a written statement Tuesday that some level of normalcy has returned to the family. ""The case is over. It's time to move on. The Cannings want nothing more than to resume their lives as a family,"" Sarno said. Neither Rachel nor her parents were at last week's news conference to announce that she had returned home. Her parents' attorney, Angelo Sarno, did not comment on what brought the reconciliation or whether Rachel was still in a relationship with her boyfriend. Canning's case attracted national attention, which Sarno said would probably continue to affect Rachel. ""Nothing good could have come from this case. Absolutely nothing good. This kid is going to be affected long term from the attention,"" Sarno said last week. CNN's Chris Welch contributed to this report.","NEW: ""The case is over.

"(CNN) -- In the end, it was all too familiar. Arsenal went out, Bayern went through -- same story, different season. For all the talk of Arsenal being able to emulate last season's famous victory at the Allianz Arena, there was one thing sorely lacking. Goals. That it managed to secure a 1-1 draw will provide some comfort to manager Arsene Wenger, whose club has gone nine years without winning a trophy. A 3-1 aggregate defeat means Arsenal will now have to shift its focus to the Premier League and FA Cup while Bayern continues its quest to dominate this competition. Last year, Arsenal arrived in Munich trailing 3-1 after a first leg where it had been taught a footballing lesson by the German giant. On that occasion, written off by every football expert on the planet, it produced one of its finest performances of recent times to win 2-0 only to exit the competition on away goals. A year on, Arsenal once again walked into the cauldron facing a two-goal deficit against a Bayern team 20 points clear at the top of the Bundesliga and determined to become the first club to successfully defend the Champions League title. Wenger's side, without several injured players including Theo Walcott and Aaron Ramsey as well as the suspended Wojciech Szczesny, was always going to find the going tough. After a rather turgid first half where neither side really managed to find its rhythm, the game exploded into life nine minutes after the interval. Bayern broke down the right and when Arsenal failed to cut out Franck Ribery's cross, Bastian Schweinsteiger took advantage by firing home from close range. That should have seen Bayern out of sight, but Arsenal had other ideas. Lukas Podolski, once of Bayern, chased down Philipp Lahm and after the defender stumbled under pressure, the Arsenal forward took possession and rifled the ball past Manuel Neuer. That signaled a period of Arsenal pressure but while the visiting side found extra space going forward, it was unable to make the breakthrough. It was Bayern which should have won the tie in stoppage time when Arjen Robben went down in the penalty area under the challenge of Laurent Koscielny. Thomas Muller stood up to take the spot kick but his effort was parried by Lukasz Fabianski, who then beat the Bayern forward to the loose ball. Not that it mattered to Bayern though, which qualified for the last eight for the 13th time. ""On the day 2-0 wasn't the best result in the first leg but we still had a chance to give it our all and to get a result,"" Arsenal midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain told ITV. ""Bayern has weaknesses like any other team and when you score anyone can get nervous. When we did that we thought we had a chance but we just couldn't do it. ""Maybe we lacked a bit of quality with the final ball. At the top level you need that. The boys put in a great shift but we can be proud of our efforts."" Arsenal's misery was compounded by an injury to record signing Mesut Ozil, who was withdrawn at halftime with a hamstring problem. In the night's other game, Atletico Madrid sealed its place in the quarterfinals for the first time in 17 years following a 5-1 aggregate victory over seven-time champion AC Milan. Leading 1-0 from the first leg, Atletico, second in in La Liga, took a third minute lead through the prolific Diego Costa on its way to a 4-1 win win. Milan equalized courtesy of former Real Madrid star Kaka but further goals from Arda Turan, Raul Garcia and Costa's second sealed the win. ""We are grateful for the support of the fans, and the truth is that the team deserves congratulating for the way it has played,"" Costa told Spanish television. ""We have done ourselves proud. All teams who reach the quarterfinals are very good. For now we'll just enjoy."" Manager Diego Simeone was part of the last Atletico side which reached the quarterfinals of the Champions League in 1997. Here, he watched on as his team cruised past a troubled Milan team which has struggled so badly in Serie A this season. Milan's defeat means there will be no Italian club in the last eight of the competition for the first time since 2009. Costa, who made his debut for Spain last week, was the hero at the San Siro in the first leg and once again it was he who tormented Milan. His spectacular opener set the home side on its way and even when Kaka leveled, Atletico refused to buckle. Turan netted a classy second before Garcia headed home Koke's cross to give his side a two-goal cushion. Costa then wrapped up the win late on with his seventh goal in five Champions League games.","Bayern Munich through to last eight of the Champions League .

"(CNN) -- The London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games were delivered £377 million ($601 million) under budget. Figures released by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport show the forecasted cost of the two quadrennial events at £8.921 billion ($14.236 billion), a reduction on the predicted figure of £9.298 billion. Overall the government says savings of £1.032 billion have been made across all areas of the Games, including £47 million on the Olympic Delivery Authority's construction and transport programs. ""London 2012 was a tremendous success, and it is a significant achievement to deliver this large and complex program on time and under budget,"" said minister for sport Hugh Robertson. ""The work of the construction and delivery teams, from the ODA and LOCOG (London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games), has set a very high standard and I have no doubt that London 2012 has set a new benchmark for the management of Olympic and Paralympic Games in future."" With £480 million of the budget set out for the Games unspent, the government will now be under scrutiny as to whether the 2012 Games will deliver a lasting legacy. The process of transforming London's Olympic Park in the east of the Britain's capital from a world-class sporting venue into a brand new area of the English capital has already begun in earnest with the handover of the site to the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC) from LOCOG. The LLDC has already removed many of the temporary structures around the Park. ""The UK hosted a spectacular Olympic and Paralympic Games this summer,"" LOCOG chairman Sebastian Coe said in a statement. ""We have now begun the first chapter of the lasting legacy we promised when we bid for the Games. ""We began our work straight after the Games to transform the venues, parklands and facilities in the Olympic Park to ensure generations to come will benefit from a golden summer. ""I congratulate my team for taking out all the temporary structures so quickly so that the job of transformation continues quickly."" Opinion: Did the U.S. tune out for the Paralympics? The area, which will be known as the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, will now undergo a £292 million ($467 million) redevelopment, including the creation of 2,818 news houses and apartments in the former Olympic Village site. ""This will take some time, but the wait will be worth it,"" explained LLDC interim chief executive Dennis Hone. ""Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park will be a fantastic new place to live, work and visit and enjoy. This really is an opportunity to create a legacy of the type we have never seen before."" The LLDC has now taken control of the Aquatics Centre, the Velodrome and the Basketball Arena, with handball venue the Copper Box to come under its jurisdiction in November before the Olympic Stadium and press and broadcast centers are handed over in December. A decision on the Olympic Stadium's new tenants has yet to be reached. A total of 250,000 temporary seats, 165,000m2 of tents and 140 kilometers of fencing have already been removed from venues across London, including the beach volleyball arena at Horse Guard's Parade and the Equestrian Arena at Greenwich Park. The process is scheduled to be completed by January 2014, with 8,000 jobs, five new neighborhoods, three new schools, nine new nurseries, three new health centers and a new library to be created at the Park. The legacy of the Games will spread beyond construction projects within the Park. London also hopes to host a one-day road cycling race, similar to the prestigious Paris-Roubaix event, which would be open to both professionals and amateurs. Organizers hope the inaugural race can be staged in August 2013, cashing in on Britain's recent domination of cycling. Bradley Wiggins became the nation's first Tour de France winner earlier this year, while Team GB collected a total of 12 medals, eight gold, in the Olympic Velodrome.","British government says London 2012 delivered $601 million under budget .

"(CNN) -- Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir arrived in neighboring South Sudan on Monday for talks on unrest in the latter nation that has left hundreds dead. He flew into the airport in the capital of Juba before heading to the presidential palace to meet his South Sudan counterpart, President Salva Kiir. The two later held a joint news conference with al-Bashir stressing readiness to support South Sudan, according to the official Sudan News Agency. Al-Bashir's visit comes as rival parties in the South Sudan power struggle work to find a solution to the violence. Meanwhile, talks between South Sudan's government and rebels began Monday in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Those negotiations were delayed last week. ""The two delegations appreciated the gravity of the situation and the need and urgency of resolving the crisis in South Sudan. They reminded themselves of the long-drawn liberation struggle that culminated in the independence of their country. They regretted the unfortunate situation which the current conflict has brought,"" read a statement from the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, an East African trade bloc helping to mediate between the parties. Talks are expected to pick up again on Tuesday. The negotiations ""come not a moment too soon,"" African Union Chairwoman Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma said in a statement. ""Not a single day can be lost in the search for peace in South Sudan. Stopping the fighting in South Sudan is not only a humanitarian imperative but also a strategic necessity, in order to halt the rapid descent of Africa's newest nation into collapse."" South Sudan erupted in violence on December 15 when rebels loyal to ousted Vice President Riek Machar tried to stage a coup. Since then, militia members loyal to the ousted leader have battled government forces. Violence quickly spread with reports of mass killings emerging nationwide. As teams from both sides are negotiating, fighting rages. Three weeks of fighting have left more than 1,000 people dead and forced 200,000 from their homes, officials say. South Sudan seceded from Sudan in 2011 after decades of war, making it the world's youngest nation. Despite the split, al-Bashir has a stake in the talks. Though South Sudan and Sudan divorced, they still have unresolved oil issues. Prolonged fighting has cut South Sudan's oil output, affecting both economies.

"(CNN) -- A former Akron, Ohio, police captain who was convicted of murdering his wife in 1997 has been cleared of the crime and released after more than 14 years in prison. Douglas Prade walked out of the Madison Correctional Institution around 4:30 p.m. Tuesday, CNN affiliate WOIO reported, a few hours after Summit County Common Pleas Judge Judy Hunter ruled he was innocent of the crime and ordered him released. County officials said they will appeal the decision. Margo Prade, a popular doctor, was found dead of multiple gunshot wounds in her vehicle in her office's parking lot in November 1997. Douglas Prade was indicted for aggravated murder the next February and convicted in September of that year. He was sentenced to life in prison. The case dominated local headlines for months and was the subject of crime shows on national TV. Although DNA tests conducted at the time were inconclusive, the main evidence against the captain was a bite mark on the victim's arm and lab coat that a prosecution expert matched to her husband's teeth. No weapon was found and prosecutors produced no one who witnessed the killing. With help from the University of Cincinnati's Innocence Project, Douglas Prade appealed the conviction and eventually won a ruling from the Ohio Supreme Court in 2010 that allowed the DNA evidence to be retested using newer methods. When the results came back, none of the DNA evidence could be matched to Douglas Prade. ""The defendant has been conclusively excluded as the contributor of the male DNA on the bite mark section of the lab coat or anywhere else,"" Hunter wrote in her 26-page ruling Tuesday. Hunter also cast serious doubt on the reliability of bite-mark evidence, leaving the prosecution with little to go on. ""The DNA results prove what Prade has said all along, that he is 100% innocent,"" Carrie Woods, Prade's Innocence Project lawyer, said after a hearing last summer. ""The Court is not unsympathetic to the family members, friends and community who want to see justice for Dr. Prade,"" Hunter wrote. ""However, the evidence that the defendant presented in this case is clear and convincing. Based on the review of the conclusive Y-STR DNA test results and the evidence from the 1998 trial, the court is firmly convinced that no reasonable juror would convict the defendant for the crime of aggravated murder with a firearm."" She ordered that Prade be released from prison ""forthwith."" Summit County law enforcement officials were dismayed at the decision. ""This is a gross misapplication of the law, and we will be appealing Prade's exoneration,"" county Prosecutor Sherri Bevan Walsh said in a news release. ""All of the evidence clearly points to Prade as Dr. Margo Prade's killer,"" Akron Police Chief James Nice said in the same release. ""He was proven guilty in front of a jury using a substantial amount of other evidence."" If Ohio's Ninth District Court of Appeals reverses Hunter's ruling, the state will have 30 days to file a motion seeking a new trial, Walsh's office said. ""I feel like my life is in danger and my family's life is in danger now. (Dr. Prade and her mother) are probably turning over in their graves, but God will have the final say,"" Tony Fowler, Margo Prade's nephew, told CNN affiliate WEWS. ""The decision is unfair and unjust, in my opinion,"" Tammy Fowler, a niece, told the station.","Judge in Akron, Ohio, finds man innocent of crime for which he was convicted in 1998 .

"(CNN) -- A once fat cat is now almost broke, literally. Not the Wall Street-type, but the four-legged, furry variety. A 7-year-old tabby called Puddy Cat is at the center of an extensive embezzlement case out of Suffolk County, Massachusetts. Puddy Cat once stood to inherit part of a trust fund worth at least $450,000, until its owner fell victim to a couple of swindling neighbors, prosecutors said. Puddy Cat belongs to a 74-year-old Brighton woman who is suffering from progressive dementia and living in a nursing home. The woman created the ""Puddy Cat Trust"" in her will and specified that upon her death, the tabby was to be cared for through the trust and that all remaining assets would benefit animal welfare groups. The Suffolk County district attorney said Thursday in a news release that several years ago, the two neighbors, who were roommates, befriended Puddy Cat's owner and offered to take care of the beloved cat. Those two neighbors, Randi Berkowitz, 63, and Patricia DiGiacomo, 58, pleaded not guilty in court Thursday to a 63-count indictment accusing them of raiding the victim's financial accounts. They are accused of using Puddy Cat to swindle the ailing victim out of her life savings and the tabby out of its inheritance. District Attorney Daniel F. Conley said the pair used Puddy Cat, under the guise of caring for the feline, to gain access to the victim's bank accounts and financial assets. ""This is one of the most startling cases of elder exploitation we've seen in years,"" Conley said. Berkowitz and DiGiacomo are charged with a laundry list of crimes, including embezzlement, larceny, intimidation and perjury. Beginning in late 2012, Berkowitz persuaded the victim to give Berkowitz her power of attorney and name her the administrator of her will, granting Berkowitz authority to make financial and other decisions in the victim's name, according to Assistant District Attorney Michele Granda. ""The defendant had unrestricted access to the victim's finances and even got the victim to sign blank checks."" Granda said that within 12 months of Berkowitz being given power of attorney, the neighbors had drained the victim's bank account of $175,000. They allegedly used the money to buy a $27,000 Mini Cooper car, an iPad, exercise equipment and specialty kitchen items, among other purchases. Granda said authorities were able to recover some of the stolen money. Prosecutors also accuse Berkowitz and DiGiacomo of gaining ownership of the woman's condominium. Berkowitz's attorney, Susan Rayburn, told CNN her client is innocent of the charges. Rayburn said Berkowitz has felt ""hunted and harassed"" by authorities. ""What it feels like to me, in my experience, is more of a witch hunt than anything else. It's been really vindictive,"" Rayburn told CNN affiliate WBZ. In response to an e-mail, DiGiacomo's attorney, Srikanth Reddy, said Monday that his law firm had no comment on the case, other than to say ""DiGiacomo maintains that she is innocent of the State's allegations."" After the not guilty pleas at the arraignment Thursday, the judge released the pair on their own recognizance on the condition that they stay away from the nursing home where the alleged victim is living and that they avoid the kennel where Puddy Cat lives.","Two Massachusetts women charged with stealing $450,000 from elderly neighbor .

"Washington (CNN) -- This year's first day of reckoning for President Barack Obama's signature domestic initiative is fast approaching. The second is seven-plus months away. The big question: Will the math on the first have anything to do with the math on the second? March 31 is the first benchmark: the first big enrollment deadline for what Democrats prefer to call the Affordable Care Act. The second is Election Day in November. The administration is all but certain to fall short of its stated enrollment goal of 7 million. But after a disastrous initial rollout, crossing the 6 million mark by the March 31 deadline appears within reach, and the White House will make the case that it is a policy success that leaves the program on a firm footing. But whether the improving numbers can be used to reshape the political climate as it relates to the health care law depends on whether Democrats on the ballot this year in competitive races have the courage to more forcefully rebut the Republican argument that the health care law is a disaster. Justices to hear 'Hobby Lobby' case on Obamacare birth control rule . Nancy Pelosi sees a shifting tide. ""I believe that it's a winner,"" the House minority leader said Thursday. But she then added the critical part: ""That is a case we have to make."" Some of Pelosi's point is personal: She was House speaker when the health care law passed, and it is a proud piece of her legislative legacy. Some of her appeal, though, is raw politics: She believes that Democrats who run from the health care law only help Republicans who are making it their focus in the midterm campaign. She is at the moment a lonely voice in making the case that Democrats should celebrate the law, not distance themselves from it. And the latest polling underscores her challenge in persuading Democrats in tough races -- especially statewide Senate contests -- to be more open, and aggressive, in promoting the law. A Pew Center survey released Thursday found that 53% of Americans disapprove of the 2010 health care law; 41% approve. Here's a nugget in that survey that Pelosi could use to make her case: A majority of those who oppose the Affordable Care Act think politicians should enact fixes to make it work better. But most of the data suggest the issue will remain a potent one for the GOP. Though 72% of Democrats support the law, only 37% of independents and 8% of Republicans do. And the potency of the health care issue for the GOP comes into stark focus when you dig deeper into the demographic splits in the Pew data. Obama: Democrats get 'clobbered' in midterms . In a midterm year, turnout among African-Americans and Latinos tends to drop significantly, something Obama lamented yet again Thursday night at a Democratic fundraising dinner. ""In midterms, we get clobbered,"" the President said, ""either because we don't think it's important or we've become so discouraged about what's happening in Washington that we think it's not worth our while."" History suggests the midterm electorate will be older and whiter than in a presidential year, something that would tilt the scales -- on health care and other issues -- in the GOP direction. Consider this from the Pew health care survey: Seventy-seven percent of blacks support the law, as do 47% of Hispanics. But just 33% of whites support the law. And just 35% of those over the age of 65 support the law; 56% oppose it. In presidential years, when more younger voters and people of color turn out, the demographics favor Democrats. But this year, the GOP appears likely to have a demographic advantage and one magnified by the fact that those most likely to vote in November are least likely to support the President's health care law.","March 31 is big deadline for Obamacare enrollment, but November elections are true test .

"(CNN) -- Russian President Vladmir Putin says everyone will be welcomed to next year's Winter Olympics in Russia, regardless of sexual orientation -- comments that come on the heels of a controversial Russian law on homosexuality. Putin made his latest assurances on the matter on Monday as he welcomed International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach and other sports officials to his summer residence in Sochi -- the Black Sea resort town where the Games will happen in February -- state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported. ""We are doing everything, both the organizers and our athletes and fans, so that participants and guests feel comfortable in Sochi, regardless of nationality, race or sexual orientation,"" Putin said, according to RIA Novosti. Putin in June signed a law that prohibits in Russia the distribution of information to minors that promotes same-sex relationships. The legislation gives authorities the power to impose fines as well as detain and deport foreigners who are deemed to have breached the law. The law sparked global outrage and a wave of protests demanding a boycott of the Games. In September, pop singer Cher said she had refused an invitation to perform because of the legislation. Putin also said in an interview on state television in September that gay people would not be discriminated against at the Sochi Games. But that appeared at odds with statements made by government officials that the anti-gay propaganda law would be enforced. The IOC in August said it received assurances ""from the highest level of government in Russia"" that the law would not affect people attending or taking part in the Games. The next month, the IOC said the law did not violate the Olympic Charter . In August, U.S. President Barack Obama rejected calls for his country to boycott the Games, saying such a move would hurt American athletes who trained and sacrificed to qualify.

"(CNN)  -- On the heels of the passage of Arizona's racial profiling law, tens of thousands of people from all over the country have marched in support of human rights and against the legislation. That law, SB 1070, requires Arizona law enforcement agents to determine the citizenship status of people they stop if the officer has an undefined ""reasonable suspicion"" that the person is not in this country lawfully. The ACLU and a coalition of civil rights groups filed a lawsuit this week challenging the unconstitutional law. There is little doubt among experts that the new Arizona law will lead to increased racial profiling. Civil libertarians have criticized the law as a violation of basic constitutional rights because it transforms Arizona's Latino community and other people of color -- who may be presumed by law enforcement officers to be in the country ""unlawfully"" -- into potential criminal suspects. Constitutional scholars have criticized the legislation by invoking the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution, which prevents states from usurping the federal government's authority to regulate immigration. But what has been largely absent from the public debate about the legality and morality of SB 1070 is Arizona's blatant violation of international human rights law, as underscored by several U.N. experts. The law flies in the face of Arizona's human rights obligations, particularly the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD), which the United States ratified in 1994 and which is binding on all levels of federal, state and local governments, including Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, who signed the bill. ICERD obligates federal, state and local governments to guarantee that laws and policies do not discriminate, in purpose or effect, on the grounds of race, color, descent or national or ethnic origin. Under ICERD, all noncitizens, regardless of their immigration status, are entitled to equal protection and equality before the law. Federal, state and local governments are barred from employing or carrying out racial or ethnic discrimination against individuals or communities. The treaty states ""each state party undertakes to engage in no act or practice of racial discrimination against persons, groups of persons or institutions and to ensure that all public authorities and public institutions, national and local, shall act in conformity with this obligation."" Last summer, the ACLU and the Rights Working Group released a human rights report that compiled data from across the United States. It revealed that law enforcement agencies investigate, stop, frisk or search racial minorities based upon subjective identity-based characteristics, rather than identifiable evidence of illegal activity. The report found that racial profiling remains a pervasive problem around the country. The report, which was submitted to the U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD), highlighted profiling in 22 states. In Arizona, it showed that African-American and Latino drivers were 2.5 times more likely than white drivers to be searched after being stopped by the highway patrol. Native American drivers were 3.25 times more likely to be searched, even though they were less likely to be found with contraband. The report also documented the many human rights violations committed by the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office, under the direction of Joe Arpaio. The office has received national and international attention for its practices of profiling and harassment of Latinos. In early 2009, Arpaio's actions resulted in a Department of Justice investigation based on ""alleged patterns or practices of discriminatory police practices and unconstitutional searches and seizures ... and on allegations of national origin discrimination.""  So SB 1070 exacerbates an already poor human rights record. In September, the CERD committee sent a letter to the Obama administration conveying concerns about the lack of progress in addressing racial discrimination and urging it to pass the End Racial Profiling Act and end immigration programs that foster racial profiling. Since that time, as evidenced by Arizona's law, profiling has actually gotten worse. Despite the language in the bill cited by proponents as evidence of its design to prevent profiling, there can be no doubt that SB 1070 invites law enforcement agents to stop people on the street based upon how they those people look, as opposed to any verifiable evidence of criminal activity, or, alternatively, to stop them for a legitimate reason and then demand their ""papers"" based on appearance or race. It is inevitable that there will be an increase in racial profiling and harassment of minorities. As a party to ICERD, the U.S. and the state of Arizona have a legal and moral obligation to end all programs and policies that disproportionately discriminate against racial or ethnic minorities. At the state level, Arizona must repeal this discriminatory legislation. At the federal level, the Obama administration should take legal action against Arizona to stop this law from taking effect in its entirety. It is encouraging that Attorney General Eric Holder is considering all options, including bringing legal action against Arizona or joining lawsuits filed by other parties. Congress must also take action to bring this country into conformity with both the Constitution and international human rights obligations by passing the End Racial Profiling Act. This act would ban the practice of racial profiling by federal law enforcement agencies and provide federal funding to state and local police departments if they adopt policies to prohibit the practice. Also, the United States should create a concrete program of action for full implementation of the treaty, making sure state governments are protecting and promoting human rights. A concrete ICERD implementation plan would educate state and local officials, such as Brewer, about their legal obligations under U.S. treaties and international law and serve to educate the public, as well. President Obama called Arizona's law ""misguided"" and said that it ""threatened to undermine basic notions of fairness that we cherish as Americans, as well as the trust between police and their communities that is so crucial to keeping us safe."" Recently, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stated that ""Human rights are universal, but their experience is local. This is why we are committed to holding everyone to the same standard, including ourselves."" They have it right. But words are not enough. It is time for the U.S. government to match its human rights rhetoric with action and for our elected leaders to protect and defend the basic human rights of all people. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Chandra Bhatnagar.","Chandra Bhatnagar: Experts say Arizona law will lead to increased racial profiling .

"(CNN) -- Crisis club Racing Santander has been thrown out of next season's Copa del Rey after its players staged a bizarre on-pitch boycott of a quarterfinal tie against Real Sociedad. The protest Thursday saw Racing players link arms on the center circle and refuse to play the second leg. They needed to pull back a two-goal deficit to earn a last four clash with Catalan giants Barcelona, but months of frustration over unpaid wages boiled over. The match was quickly abandoned but the Spanish football federation (RFEF) reacted Friday by imposing the penalty and a fine of â‚¬3,000 ($4050) on the stricken Cantabrian club. A statement on the federation's official website said its competitions committee had awarded the tie to Basque side Real Sociedad, who had led 3-1 from their home leg. ""The non-appearing club will not be able to participate in the next edition of the Copa del Rey,"" it read. The Racing players, who were applauded by their home fans in the El Sardinero, had warned before the match that they would take action unless club president Angel Lavin and his board resigned. Substitutes and staff -- including coach Paco Fernandez -- who has reportedly not been paid for sixth months -- performed the same gesture of defiance on the touchline before the referee Gil Manzano called a halt to the proceedings after less than a minute. Fernandez told a post-match press conference that he was proud of his players for the stance they had taken and the support they had received. ""We feel touched. We regret having to make this decision but we have done it out of respect to football, the sport that we love, and to ourselves,"" he said. ""I want to thank my players for their bravery. Today was the biggest game of our lives and we have done it for our dignity. Without the fans' support, today's decision would have been very difficult to take."" Racing had reached the quarterfinals of the Copa del Rey after upset victories over La Liga top-flight sides Sevilla and Almeria, despite languishing in Spain's third division. The majority of the club's 101-year history has been spent in the top division of La Liga themselves with a sixth-placed finish as recently as 2008. But plagued by debt, Racing suffered two straight relegations as well as entering administration.","Racing Santander players stage boycott of Copa del Rey quarterfinal .

"(CNN) -- Reports that Schapelle Corby could earn millions of dollars for her first post-jail media interview have triggered howls of protest that crime will have paid for the Australian drug trafficker. But legal experts say Australia's proceeds of crime laws could ultimately make it a challenge for her to hold on to any profits made from selling her story. A high-profile breakfast host for Australian television network Seven -- the broadcaster tipped to be the front-runner to secure the Corby interview -- spoke out on-air Tuesday voicing his disapproval at unconfirmed reports his bosses were set to pay A$2 million (about $1.8 million) for her story. ""I reckon we should have nothing to do with her as a network. Totally disagree with paying a convicted drug smuggler A$2 million,"" said David Koch, co-host of the Sunrise program. ""I know Indonesia's corrupt and all that sort of stuff, but you know, she's convicted, so why pay the money?"" Seven did not respond to CNN's request for comment, but in Bali, Seven journalist Mike Willesee told reporters outside the luxury compound where Corby has been staying with her family that the network was paying for security guards attached to her since her release. He said a deal had not yet been struck to secure the interview, but disputed the amounts cited by Koch. Corby, 36, was released on parole from a prison in Bali, Indonesia, Monday after being convicted almost nine years ago of smuggling 9 pounds (4.1 kilograms) of marijuana into Bali's Denpasar International Airport. She has maintained she was the victim of a set-up and many Australians sympathize with her cause. Her case has attracted immense interest from Australian media, and on her release she was mobbed by a throng of reporters chasing an interview. But Jenna Price, senior lecturer in journalism at the University of Technology, Sydney, said forking out big dollars for the Corby interview ""could backfire"" on the network that successfully bid on her story this time. She said there was a long tradition of ""checkbook journalism"" by Australia's highly competitive commercial broadcasters, stretching back to the Lindy Chamberlain case in the 1980s. But while popular sentiment surrounding certain stories, such as the Beaconsfield mine collapse survivors, held that subjects were entitled to financially benefit from their experiences, public sympathy for, and interest in, Corby appeared to have waned in the years since her conviction. ""I just don't think people feel very fondly about Schapelle Corby. They just don't,"" said Price. ""They did, and then they got bored with her."" On social media, many were critical of the reports of an impending big payday for Corby. ""I see a line of pot smugglers heading towards Bali, thinking 'In 10 years, I'll be rich!'"" wrote Twitter user @milesb. ""That's 200k per year her jail time... Plus other money she's going to make... Not a bad wage,"" wrote @Crafterxxx. Checkbook journalism by television networks has been under scrutiny in Australia recently, after Seven reportedly paid a significant sum for an interview with the partner of Simon Gittany, subsequently sentenced today to 18 years for having murdered his former girlfriend. Price said the negative public response to Corby's potential paycheck were in part ""a response to being bored to tears"" by the saga. ""The entire time she's been in prison, every bit of Schapelle's life has been thoroughly explored. What more could she possibly tell us?"" She said unimpressive ratings for a telemovie based on Corby's story were evidence of the public's fatigue. ""It's staggering to me that Seven is doing this because they must have had some indication that the audience was tiring of the story."" Hugh McDermott, senior law enforcement lecturer at Charles Sturt University, said Corby could find it difficult to hold on to any money earned for an interview, due to Australian laws allowing the government to seize assets acquired through the proceeds of criminal activity. Australian authorities had previously used those provisions to seize Corby's earnings from a magazine interview, he said. ""There's a real question as to whether there would be an appetite to go after her, because she is so popular here in some sectors, but there are people in Indonesian law enforcement who would very much like to go after her if she's paid that money,"" he said. Under an agreement between Australia and Indonesia, Indonesian authorities could request that their Australian counterparts act to recover the funds. However, Corby could attempt to put the money beyond reach of officials by placing it in an offshore bank account or trust, he said. ""If she's smart, she will put the money offshore so it can't be touched,"" he said. The first clear picture of Corby since her release appeared in Australian media Tuesday, a picture of her toasting her freedom with a beer alongside her brother. The picture was subsequently removed from websites amid a dispute over who owned, and who had been paid for, the photo.","Australian TV networks are chasing an interview with drug trafficker Schapelle Corby .

"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- A second round of talks Thursday between Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and opposition leaders were fruitless, but both parties decided to keep talking. Ukrainian anti-government protesters observed a truce of several hours with police to give the negotiations room for success. Hundreds of protesters, who have been clashing with police in the capital, Kiev, since Sunday heard from boxer-turned-opposition-leader Vitaly Klitschko after the talks with Yanukovych. ""He said no to his resignation and cabinet resignation."" Klitschko told opposition supporters who want the government to resign and start early elections, among other demands. ""It does not make sense to negotiate with someone who intends to cheat,"" Klitschko said. The sharp rhetoric was echoed by the President's press office, which issued a statement after the talks. ""Unfortunately, for the second time, leaders of the opposition refused to declare the statement condemning extremist actions,"" it said. The president's statement goes on to say that ""negotiations will be continued."" On Wednesday Klitschko told supporters that he would lead them in an ""attack"" if their demands for snap elections were not met. He accused Yanukovych's government of having the blood of protesters on its hands after four reported deaths in the clashes. ""When we talked about canceling the new laws that make each of us here a criminal, we heard that maybe this can be a point of negotiations,"" Klitschko said Wednesday. ""I will be with the people. If I have to fight, I will fight. If I have to go under bullets, I will. I will stand up for the people, because I want to live in a different country."" He added, amid the chants of supporters: ""If tomorrow the President does not make a step forward, we will attack."" Meanwhile, Prime Minister Mykola Azarov declined Thursday to apologize for the violence unfolding during the protests and told CNN's Richard Quest that law enforcement officers acted within the law and did not have firearms. Police were merely responding to an effort to overthrow the government, Azarov said, adding that Ukraine was not in Russia's pocket. Thousands of protesters have been braving the freezing cold to voice their anger against the sweeping new anti-protest laws. Old and young, they have been building makeshift barricades and weapons in the snow as they take on riot police. Foreign governments voice concern . Washington has condemned the growing violence -- particularly against journalists and peaceful protesters -- and, alongside the European Union, has urged all parties to exercise restraint and find a democratic solution to the political crisis. The U.S. ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul, tweeted Wednesday that he was ""watching with sadness"" the events in Kiev. The U.S. Embassy in Kiev said in a prepared statement that it has ""revoked the visas of several Ukrainians who were linked to the violence"" in response to actions taken against protesters in November and December. ""We are considering further action against those responsible for the current violence,"" it said. Poland and Germany said their foreign ministers had spoken by phone to their Ukrainian counterpart, Leonid Kozhara, voicing their concern about the escalating violence. German Chancellor Angela Merkel issued a statement urging the Ukrainian government to hold discussions with the opposition. ""We expect that the Ukrainian government secures its people democratic freedoms, especially to allow for peaceful demonstrations, to protect lives -- and that the use of force does not take place. We are not just concerned but appalled in the way certain laws were pushed through that would put into question such freedoms,"" she said. Controversial law . The clashes are an escalation of weeks of largely peaceful public protests prompted by Yanukovych's decision in November to spurn a planned trade deal with the European Union and turn toward Russia instead. The controversial new protest laws have sparked concerns they could be used to put down demonstrations and deny people the right to free speech. They include provisions barring people from wearing helmets and masks to rallies, from setting up tents or sound equipment without prior police permission, and from traveling in convoys of more than five vehicles without authorization. A separate Interior Ministry order allowing riot police to use firearms came into force Tuesday, according to the official Ukrainian legislation website. Ukraine's Institute of Mass Information, an organization promoting media rights and freedom of speech, said 36 journalists had been injured while reporting on the clashes in recent days. Ukraine's national union of journalists called on the Interior Ministry on Wednesday to issue an order forbidding police from using violence against journalists. Ukraine's future ties . In December, despite weeks of protest by anti-government demonstrators, Yanukovych agreed to a deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin for Moscow to buy Ukrainian debt and slash the price Kiev pays for its gas. The tumult in Ukraine goes to the heart of its future ties with Russia and the rest of Europe. Ukraine is split between pro-European regions in the west and a more Russia-oriented east. The protests have unfolded since November 21, when Yanukovych changed his stance on the EU trade pact, which had been years in the making. The demonstrators say an EU agreement would open borders to trade and set the stage for modernization and inclusion. Ukraine's government says the terms needed to be renegotiated to protect Ukrainians better. CNN's Anna Maja Rappard, Laura Smith-Spark and Susannah Palk, Christopher Williams contributed to this report.","NEW: Second round of talks between protesters and government ended without deal .

"(CNN) -- Twenty-five years ago, America discovered ""one of England's loudest bands,"" courtesy of documentarian Marty DiBergi and his film, ""This Is Spinal Tap."" Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer will perform Spinal Tap and Folksmen songs on tour. It was all parody -- DiBergi was director Rob Reiner, and cohorts Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer played the heavy-metal musicians in Spinal Tap -- but for a fictional band, Spinal Tap has had a long afterlife. The film gave birth to several catchphrases, including one -- ""up to 11"" -- that's made it into the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary. There are Web sites devoted to the Tap, including at least one, http://tap-albums.s5.com/, that offers a complete discography of the fictional band's nonexistent albums. And Guest, McKean and Shearer have never left their spandexed alter egos behind. The band reunited for a 1992 album, ""Break Like the Wind,"" and again for a 2001 tour. For the latter, the opening act was another Guest-McKean-Shearer collaboration, the Folksmen from Guest's film ""A Mighty Wind."" Now Shearer, McKean and Guest are hitting the road again, but not as Spinal Tap or the Folksmen. They're playing ... themselves. ""We're trying very hard to get across the idea that this is us, and only us,"" says Shearer in a phone interview discussing the trio's ""Unwigged & Unplugged"" 30-date acoustic tour, which kicks off Friday in Vancouver, British Columbia. ""And because we don't often appear as ourselves -- because we most often appear as characters -- we're trying to dress it up as a treat, a rare treat, to see us as ourselves."" The group will be performing both Spinal Tap and Folksmen songs, though, Shearer adds, ""[we'll be] doing these songs kind of in a different way because we're approaching them as ourselves and not as these characters."" Have no fear, however, Tap fans: A new album, ""Back from the Dead,"" is due out in June. Shearer took some time out from tour preparations to talk about Spinal Tap's origins, the similarities between Tap and Metallica, and how ""Start Me Up"" became more closely identified with the Folksmen than the Rolling Stones. The following is an edited version of that interview. CNN: It's been 25 years since ""This Is Spinal Tap,"" but it's been much longer since Spinal Tap came together. Do you remember what brought it about -- and who it's based on? Shearer: You know, I would like to make a little book composed of all the bands that people have guessed Spinal Tap actually is -- there would be a lot of bands in there. And in fact it is about a lot of bands -- it's never been about one band. When we did this, the Pythons had already done [the Beatles parody] the Rutles, so there had been a piece that ... was a really specific spoof of a really specific band. That was something we didn't want to do -- that had been done. Our notion was to ... sort of encapsulate everything we know about rock 'n' roll -- and everything we found funny or amusing about bands -- into one band. So it was a process of smooshing all that stuff into this fictional band. CNN: Are you familiar about this new movie called ""Anvil""? [The documentary, about a real heavy-metal band, has been compared to ""This Is Spinal Tap.""] . Shearer: I've been reading about it and hearing about it a lot, but I haven't seen it. ... It sounds interesting. The last thing I've seen along that line was ""Some Kind of Monster."" ... Was that amazing. That was stupefying. ... I heard they had a therapist. But it wasn't really a therapist -- it was a life coach. Which is different -- and worse (laughs). Even more humiliating. It's one thing to have somebody who's a therapist, but ... did you ever see ""Starting Over""? The daytime series on NBC? CNN: No. Shearer: Oh, four or five women in a house with two life coaches. Oh my God, it was just shocking. Well, ""Some Kind of Monster"" is in that vein. CNN: How do you guys go about writing songs? The songs on the first album were wonderful pastiches of various heavy metal-type things. On the second album you had more styles and brought in guest musicians, including [renowned session pianist] Nicky Hopkins for ""Rainy Day Sun."" Shearer: My God, yeah. Nicky had actually come in, I think, to audition for the movie but couldn't do the movie or something, but we'd always dreamed to work with Nicky. How we write the songs -- ... every one is a different experience. In the case of Tap, it's what seems like a funny idea sort of leads to a riff or some lyrics. In the case of the Folksmen, I think there was more -- at least the stuff Michael and I wrote together -- a sense these certain kinds of songs that became clichés in that era of folk music, and we sort of have to touch each of these bases. CNN: Like ""Blood on the Coal,"" a combination of coal mining and train song. Shearer: Yeah! We saved you the time. It was a twofer. ... There were a lot of songs in that era that were kind of based loosely or less loosely on the Bible, so we wrote ""The Good Book Song,"" and then of course the great cliché of folk music is the rambler or wandering song, so we wrote ""Never Did No Wanderin',"" about a guy who just stayed home. CNN: Since you're going to be performing as you, are you worried that people will show up wondering where the costumes are, or perhaps yell out, ""Hey Harry, I want to hear Smithers,"" or ""Hey Chris, do Harlan Pepper""? Shearer: Each seat will be [affixed] with Taser equipment to discourage that. ... Hopefully, we'll be so entrancing that they won't be even thinking of talking to us, except if we ask for questions. But as to what people are expecting, we're trying very hard to get across the idea that this is us, and only us, and because we don't often appear as ourselves -- because we most often appear as characters -- we're trying to dress it up as a treat, a rare treat, to see us as ourselves and doing these songs kind of in a different way, because we're approaching them as ourselves and not as these characters. CNN: Are you planning to do covers on the order of ""Start Me Up""? [The Folksmen covered the Rolling Stones song on the ""Mighty Wind"" soundtrack.] . Shearer: ""Start Me Up"" is actually the only song that we didn't write that's in the show. I can't resist [it] -- none of us can -- but I have a personal affection for it. After the Super Bowl a few years ago in Detroit, where the Stones played halftime, a few weeks later I met somebody who said that ""the soundtrack record of 'A Mighty Wind' is my 6-year-old son's favorite CD, and at the Super Bowl that day during halftime, I was in the kitchen making lunch for him and his sister, and the 6-year-old ran into the kitchen as excited as I'd ever seen him in his life and said, 'Daddy daddy daddy, they're doing a Folksmen song on the Super Bowl!'

"(CNN) -- For nearly 11 years, the family of Nelta Jacques has awaited word on her fate, as well as that of her two daughters, ages 5 and 7. The three disappeared on a rain-soaked night in June 1999 as they were traveling from Jacques' father's home in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to their home in Tampa, a drive of about 260 miles. But a grisly discovery Wednesday in a Florida canal -- a submerged minivan with human remains inside -- might provide some long-sought answers. ""It's hard. It's just some closure right now,"" Valbrun Chevalier, Jacques' brother, said Thursday. The algae-covered minivan was found Wednesday morning during a Broward County Sheriff's Office training exercise at the canal, located in a wildlife management area along I-75, authorities said in a news release. The sheriff's office has not released further details or said whether there are remains of more than one person. But Chevalier, of Port St. Lucie, Florida, said Thursday that police had notified his family that the minivan -- an older-model Dodge Caravan -- was registered to Jacques. He said he did not know whether the remains of all three had been found, but relatives were providing authorities with DNA samples Thursday. Jacques was 27 when she was last seen June 2, 1999. She had worked at a Wal-Mart and at toll plazas in Florida, along with other odd jobs, Chevalier said. She had just returned from a visit with relatives in Haiti, and had picked up her daughters -- Johanna St. Louis, 7, and Juanita Jacques, 5, from her father's home. She left for Tampa, driving her 1996 green Dodge Caravan minivan, about 11:30 p.m. in the rain, despite family members' pleas not to, Chevalier said. She never arrived. Relatives reported her and the children missing, but police had little to go on, he said. ""There wasn't anything they could do. They said, 'Wait it out.'"" ""She was about eight months pregnant,"" Dinorah Perry told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel in a story published Thursday. Perry runs Missing Children International Ministries in Pembroke Pines, Florida, and campaigned for greater police efforts in the search for Jacques. ""Her father begged her not to drive that car alone. She said, 'Daddy, I'm grown.' "" The Broward Sheriff's Office said its divers routinely conduct training exercises to recover vehicles in canals. ""Usually, cars that are stolen, abandoned or dumped for insurance fraud are found,"" the police news release said. ""About 1 in 100 vehicles yield human remains."" Detectives collected evidence and processed the scene Wednesday afternoon while divers searched the water for additional remains, authorities said. The minivan was taken to the county medical examiner's office. Before finding the minivan about 11 a.m. Wednesday, police divers had pulled two other cars out of the water without incident, the release said. While Chevalier said he is brought to tears thinking of his relatives' last desperate moments in the minivan, he hopes the police investigation turns up no foul play. ""I hope that's what happened, they got into an accident,"" he said.","Nelta Jacques and her two daughters disappeared in June 1999 .

"(CNN) -- The driver of a train that jumped the tracks last month at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport -- after having reportedly ""dozed off"" -- has been fired, a transit authority spokeswoman said Friday. The early morning incident at one of the nation's busiest airports was the operator's second serious safety violation, according to Chicago Transit Authority spokeswoman Tammy Chase. That said, Chase said the woman was primarily terminated because of the severity of that crash, which injured 32 people. The development came the same day the transit authority announced several policy changes aimed at enhancing safety. They include requirements that train operators not be working at least one day in a seven-day period and must have at least 10 hours off between shifts (up from the previous 8-hour mandate). Train operators also can't work more than 12 hours (including layover times and non-driving duties) in a 14-hour period. Fresh restrictions were also placed on those in their first year of operating trains: They can't do so more than 32 hours a week, though these employees can ""work other rail-related duties besides operating trains in their other work hours,"" the transit authority said in its statement Friday. These revised guidelines are ""nearly identical"" to those used by other transit agencies, according to Chase. She said ""nothing about the operator's work schedule suggests that fatigue should have played a factor in her performance."" The driver had a day off four days before the incident, hadn't worked for 18 hours before coming to work that day and worked 55.7 hours in the seven previous days (less than 44 of those as a rail operator), according to the transit authority spokeswoman. That said, Chase acknowledged, ""The O'Hare incident prompted us to take a closer look at our scheduling."" The wreck occurred at 2:52 a.m. on March 24, when an eight-car train failed to stop at the end of the Blue Line when it arrived at the airport station, a Chicago fire official said. The lead car appeared to have climbed an escalator adjacent to the passenger platform. ""I've investigated many accidents and trains do different things,"" National Transportation Safety Board investigator Tim DePaepe said of the train climbing the escalator. ""It's all about kinetic force. I have not seen an accident like this, personally."" A union official told reporters last month that the train's driver may have fallen asleep, CNN affiliate WLS reported. ""There are indications that she dozed off, yes,"" Amalgamated Transit Union Local 308 President Robert Kelly said, according to WLS. CNN's Alan Duke and Jennifer Feldman contributed to this report.","NEW: Official: No reason, based on schedule, that fatigue should have been a factor .

"(CNN) -- Most success-hungry entrepreneurs would tell you there's not enough hours in the day -- try saying that to Buken Makokha. Hailing from the impoverished slum of Gatina on the western outskirts of Nairobi, the 23-year-old's daily tasks include running a delivery service company, owning a barbershop and selling energy efficient stoves -- all the while putting himself through university. Makokha's typical day starts when everyone else is still deep in their sleep. By 3am, he's already up, studying and preparing his school assignments for later in the evening; by 7am, he enters the green doors of ""Clean Touch,"" the barbershop he set up three years ago at the heart of his local community. By 8am, he leaves the shop to an employee to start running his SkyHighSwiss courier service -- jumping on his motorbike, Makokha spends most of his day making personal deliveries all across the bustling Kenyan capital, whilst checking every now and then his Facebook page for any orders for his latest business venture: selling EcoZoom clean burning cook stoves. By 4.30pm, Makokha parks his motorbike, only to head to the Maasai Mara University where he is a first-year student of community development. Lectures last from 5.30pm to 8.30pm and by 10pm he's usually at bed -- only to wake up at 3am again the next day to do it all over again. Exhausting, no? ""It's a matter of determination and being focused,"" explains the enterprising businessman. ""It's only the passion that I have to work in the community,"" he adds, when asked how he juggles time to manage it all. Risk-taker . Growing up in Gatina, Makokha became a multitasking entrepreneur out of necessity to pull himself out of poverty. One of the biggest challenges, he says, was feeling alone. ""We youth in the slums are not supported,"" says Makokha. ""So you have to struggle with everything,"" he continues. ""You don't have a mentor, you have no place to run for help -- that is what is making me work every day very hard."" Read more from inspiring African entrepreneurs . Makokha says he always wanted ""to become an entrepreneur and a risk-taker."" Determined to make it, he started ""Clean Touch"" to earn money by shaving his clients and allowing them to charge their phones. Then, about a year ago he got a driver's license and launched SkyHighSwiss. ""The courier is different than the barbershop,"" says Makokha, who employs one staff member for each business. ""Because the barber I target the people I live around with and the courier I target people outside because they are busy,"" he adds. ""It's people from the whole town, people who are much more richer, they don't have time to do shopping or run for errands -- I took advantage of their busyness to make my business, so I deliver parcels, I deliver food, I deliver drinks."" 'I want to inspire' Thanks to his hard work and determination, Makokha can now afford to pay for his own living space and also attend university. But the self-made entrepreneur wants to better the lives of people in his community too. On weekends, he spends most of his time with children in Gatina, putting his community development skills into practice by mentoring young people and helping them put on theater performances. ""After my studies I want to start a project to help people where I am living,"" says the spirited entrepreneur. ""To identify their needs, to realize their potential and help them achieve their goals,"" he continues .

"(CNN) -- A whistle-blower whose research on athletes' literacy caused a firestorm of controversy at the University of North Carolina is leaving, she told CNN on Monday. Mary Willingham said it's her choice. She said she hasn't yet turned in a final letter of resignation but simply informed her boss that she plans to leave before the end of the semester. ""It's been a hostile work environment the entire year,"" Willingham told CNN. ""I stuck it out because I wanted to make good on promises to my students, but it has not been fun."" UNC spokesman Joel Curran said he was aware of Willingham's public comments, but he was ""unaware as to whether or not she has formally tendered her resignation."" Willingham was one of the original UNC staff members to publicly call attention to a system of ""paper classes"" at UNC. She told the The News & Observer newspaper in nearby Raleigh that athletes were pushed into classes that required very little work and no attendance. This year, she told CNN that during the course of her research, she personally worked with athletes who were functionally illiterate. Her research was disavowed by the university. UNC: Experts find flaws in whistle-blower's findings . UNC said three independent experts in adult literacy conducted a university-commissioned review of Willingham's research and found flaws in her claims that some athletes were reading at elementary-school levels. Willingham's research, described to CNN in January, was based on a sampling of about 180 athletes with whom Willingham worked during an eight-year period. Each had taken a 25-question reading vocabulary test on the Scholastic Abilities Test for Adults. The aptitude test used by many universities to gauge the learning level of incoming students. Last month, a Washington whistle-blower group wrote a letter to UNC, demanding the university apologize to Willingham and launch an investigation into the way it says she has been publicly smeared, most specifically by Provost Jim Dean. The group said it was possible that North Carolina whistle-blower laws were broken. Since the CNN report aired, UNC has asked for a new investigation into the yearslong paper class scandal, in which student-athletes allegedly were taking classes in which the only requirement was completing a single paper. Attorney Kenneth Wainstein, who had worked at the U.S. Justice Department for 19 years, is reviewing whether it was widely known among staff in athletics that players were sent to no-show classes where little or no work was required. U.S. Rep. Tony Cardenas, D-California, is also demanding the NCAA address why UNC was never sanctioned. Willingham told CNN that the paper classes were widely known and talked about in athletics, where she worked for seven years. She also said the paper classes were used to keep eligible some of the athletes who were reading at low levels. Some college athletes play like adults, read like 5th-graders .","Mary Willingham said her research exposed some athletes' poor reading ability .

"(CNN) -- ""Ouch!"" is what most of us think when we think of jellyfish. They sting. They're slimy and they have no brains. So who would've predicted that the lowly jellyfish could emerge from the shadows as a destroyer of fisheries and ecosystems and even as a threat to penguins and whales. Far down in Antarctica -- the last pristine wilderness, some might say -- the balance is shifting from krill to jellyfish. In this harsh land, just about everything bigger than a krill eats krill: whales, seabirds, fish and penguins. But krill are disappearing, thanks to us and the jellyfish. We fish out vast amounts of krill for our omega-3 supplements; the jellyfish eat vast quantities of plankton, leaving little for the krill to eat. All over the world, from the Bering Sea to the Sea of Japan, from the Mediterranean to the Gulf of Mexico, from China to the Chesapeake, from the Black Sea to the Baltic to the Benguela off Namibia, any place oceans are in trouble, jellyfish are taking over. Jellyfish do well in warmer waters. Our carbon dioxide emissions are both warming the water and causing it to become corrosive. Warmer water -- even a fraction of a degree -- holds less oxygen than cooler water and shifts the balance of who survives and who perishes. News: Jellyfish taking over ocean, experts warn . A strange type of jellyfish-like creature called a salp is particularly taking advantage. Salps are surely one of the world's most bizarre critters. They can grow 10% of their body length per hour and go through two generations in a day. They are more closely related to humans than to most other types of jellyfish, though they certainly don't look like it. Their bodies look like clear, gelatinous barrels. Salps don't sting, but they do their damage in their staggering numbers. Ask the operators of Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant on the coast of central California. In April 2012, Diablo was plunged into emergency shutdown because of salps clogging up the seawater intake pipes for the cooling system. This might seem freakish, but jellyfish have caused many dozens of such shutdowns at nuclear power plants, coal-fired power plants, desalination plants -- pretty much any type of industry that draws seawater. Even seawater-cooled data centers such as Google's Finnish facility are at risk. Different types of jellyfish have caused mass fish kills at salmon farms all over the world. Ireland, Scotland, Chile, Australia, New Zealand... you name it. If salmon are being farmed, you can bet there are terrible jellyfish problems. Jellyfish have also taken over Lurefjorden, one of Norway's beautiful fjords and previously one of its best fishing spots. There is nary a fish to be found. Recently, two more fjords have also become colonized by jellyfish as their fisheries have declined. The stings and emergency shutdowns are bad -- and let's face it, that whole slimy thing is a bit off-putting -- but the real problem with jellyfish is in their predator-prey dynamic with fish. On the face of it, fish are obviously the superior predator: They are smarter, faster and often bigger. Think of sharks and stingrays and largemouth bass: It's hard to imagine that jellyfish could possibly hold their own against these fighters. But jellyfish are sneaky. They eat the eggs and larvae of fish, and the plankton that the larvae would eat. And through this double whammy of predation and competition, they can cripple an ecosystem at the ankles. But jellyfish do other harm, which is only just beginning to be appreciated. They flip the food chain upside down. Normally as you go up the food chain, the energy value increases. For example, shrimp pack more energy than their plankton prey, but big fish that eat shrimp are better still. Hower, jellyfish, a very low-energy choice compared with shrimp or fish, are sequestering the higher energy of these species into their own low-energy bodies. They are, in essence, spinning gold into straw, or turning wine into water. In a healthy ecosystem, fish are superior competitors and predators over jellyfish. But the things we humans do -- we fish, we pollute, we dam, we build, we translocate -- are making life harder for fish and better for jellyfish. And so, as we look around the world, we see that many of the most heavily disturbed ecosystems have ""flipped"" to being dominated by jellyfish instead of fish. Moon jellies and comb jellies in the Inland Sea of Japan. Sea nettles in the Chesapeake and the Benguela current off Namibia. Comb jellies in the seas of Europe. Santa's hat jellies in the fjords of Norway. Refrigerator-sized jellies growing in the seas of China and drifting into Japanese and Korean waters. And once in control, they don't seem to be letting go. So, we find ourselves in the unimaginable position of being in competition with jellyfish -- and make no mistake, they have the home-court advantage. So, what can we do? What should we do? That's the problem. The ocean is our life support system -- it's where we get our food, our oxygen, many of our industries and often our inspiration. But we don't have a solution for the damages we are causing. We need to buy time, so solutions can be innovated. We need to invest in research to slow down the damage as well as to cope with our rapidly changing world. And we need to begin serious dialogue about what we value and what we are willing to do to preserve it. We could start by legislating a clean-to-intake standard in which any air or water discharged by industry must be at least as clean as it was going in, or the industry is not permitted to operate. Sure, there would be great gnashing of teeth, but quite quickly, polluting industries would have to innovate ways to be cleaner to stay economically viable. This is just one example, but we must think of many more. And we must do something. I read somewhere recently that we in all likelihood will go down in history as the generation that could have saved the ocean but chose not to. It made me cry, because I fear it is true.

"(CNN) -- Although many people think of a heart attack as a painful, sometimes fatal event, there are some heart attacks that go entirely unnoticed. Some people may have had heart attacks without knowing it, studies show. Undiagnosed, or ""silent,"" heart attacks affect nearly 200,000 people in the United States annually. As many as 40 to 60 percent of all heart attacks are unrecognized, studies show. By definition, a heart attack usually happens when a clot gets in the way of blood flow from a coronary artery to the heart. This may cause symptoms such as severe chest pain, shortness of breath, fainting and nausea. Anyone who believes that he or she is having a heart attack should seek emergency medical attention. But sometimes a heart attack is not painful, or the person experiencing it does not recognize the symptoms as heart-related, so he or she does not go to a hospital for treatment. Cardiologists have only recently become attuned to the prevalence of these silent heart attacks, and research on treatment is limited. The risk factors for silent heart attacks are the same as for regular heart attacks, experts say, and include smoking, diabetes, stress and family history.  Watch CNN Health Files: Heart attacks » . A new study from Duke University Medical Center shows that these silent heart attacks may occur more frequently than physicians thought. Even if a heart attack occurred in the distant past, it may still leave a signature called a Q-wave on an electrocardiogram. But there are silent heart attacks that do not have associated Q-waves. Researchers used a relatively new technique called delayed-enhancement cardiovascular magnetic resonance and then followed up with patients after about two years. The study was done on 185 patients who had never had a diagnosed heart attack but were suspected of having coronary artery disease. The researchers found that 35 percent of patients had evidence of a heart attack and that silent heart attacks without Q-waves were three times more common than those that had Q-waves. Patients with non-Q-wave silent heart attacks also had 11 times higher risk of death from any cause and a 17-fold risk of death from heart problems compared with patients without any heart damage. But experts do not recommend that people generally be screened for silent heart attacks unless they have other heart-related problems. ""Currently, there has not been a study that has demonstrated that early identification and therapy changes how patients with unrecognized heart attacks do in the future,"" said Dr. Han Kim, a cardiologist at Duke University and lead author of the study. ""If you don't know when an actual event occurred, it becomes difficult to prescribe therapy."" Although the study was done on a relatively small sample of people at risk of coronary artery disease, meaning the results may not apply to the general population, other cardiologists say the study has merit in adding to the knowledge of silent heart attacks. ""Ultimately, we're going to need trials to really establish what treatment works and what doesn't,"" said Dr. Eric Schelbert, a cardiologist at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine who was not involved in the study. Treatment for someone who has had a silent heart attack is usually the same for someone who came to the hospital immediately after a heart attack, Kim said. This may include beta blockers, statin drugs, aspirin or other medications, Schelbert said. Schelbert said he has seen plenty of patients who have had silent heart attacks; in fact, he has treated some of his own colleagues who have experienced them. ""It's an incredibly important thing that the physician scientist community needs to explore further,"" he said. Researchers noted that patients with non-Q-wave silent heart attacks were also generally older and were more likely to have diabetes. There needs to be more of a focus on prevention among these risk groups, said Dr. David Wiener, a cardiologist at the Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, who was not involved in the study.","Silent heart attacks affect nearly 200,000 people in the United States annually .
Researchers studied 185 people at risk of coronary artery disease .
Treatment for ""silent"" heart attacks is similar to that for regular attacks .

"(Mental Floss) -- If you believe the talking heads, it sounds like the worst of the worst is over for the ""Great Recession."" Joseph Kennedy, Sr., left, and son John F. Kennedy in 1938. Whether or not that's true, it doesn't mean that everyone is suffering or has suffered. Even during our country's worst economic downturn, some folks still knew how to make a buck -- many bucks, in fact. 1. Babe Ruth . The Sultan of Swat was never shy about conspicuous consumption. While baseball players' salaries were nowhere near as high in the '30s as they are today (adjusted for inflation), Ruth was at the top of the heap. While possibly apocryphal, when Ruth found out that his $80,000 (more than $1 million today) a year salary was $5,000 more than that of President Hoover, he is reported to have said, ""Well, I had a better year than he did."" 2. John Dillinger . While not using methods we'd endorse, John Dillinger and his compatriots managed to compile more than $3 million in today's dollars. Robbing dozens of banks and killing police officers in the process, Dillinger is not exactly what we'd call ""successful,"" but the brash, charming, and audacious Dillinger became just the type of anti-hero that the bedraggled, unemployed masses loved. He was shot to death in Chicago by FBI agents in 1934. 3. Michael J. Cullen . A man unfamiliar to most, yet whose modern ideas revolutionized American life, Cullen changed our retail landscape by creating the modern supermarket. A former executive at Kroger Grocery & Bakery Co., Cullen struck out on his own in 1930 after higher-ups rejected his ideas for more suburban, larger, self-serve food markets with room for automobile parking and allowances for new-fangled home refrigeration. Within two years, Cullen's stores (known as King Kullen Grocery) were doing more than $6 million in revenue (more than $75 million today). His motto: ""Pile it high: sell it cheap."" Mental Floss: How the Depression gave rise to soap operas . 4. James Cagney . The diminutive song-and-dance man turned tough guy turned song-and-dance man rose like a rocket through Hollywood in the 1930s. He went from a $500-a-week contract player in 1930 to one of the top ten moneymakers in Hollywood during 1935. In 1933 he was making the equivalent of $40,000 a week. His rise was so fast that he offered to do a few movies for free just to get out of a five-year contract with Warner Brothers. 5. Charles Darrow . Finding himself out of work after the crash of '29, Darrow spent a few years perfecting -- though some would say pilfering -- a little parlor game that eventually came to be known as Monopoly. Within a year of registering the patent, Parker Brothers was selling 20,000 units a year, and Darrow became the world's first millionaire game designer. 6. J. Paul Getty . An amazing beneficiary of good timing and great business acumen, Getty created an oil empire out an inheritance of $500,000 received in 1930. With oil stocks massively depressed, he snatched them up at bargain prices and created an oil conglomerate to rival Rockefeller. Throughout the 20th century he became a billionaire many times over. Mental Floss: The kidnapping of Getty's grandson . 7. Glenn Miller . The King of Swing may have been Benny Goodman, but the King of Pop in the 1930s was Glenn Miller. From his humble beginnings as a traveling trombone player -- and superb high school football player being named ""best left end in Colorado"" -- Miller rose to put together his first band in 1937. The band fell apart. Undaunted as any good left end would be, he reorganized a new group in 1938 and quickly found success. With hits like ""In the Mood,"" ""String Of Pearls,"" and ""Moonlight Serenade,"" Miller and his band found themselves on radio, in the movies and commanding a salary of nearly $20,000 a week. In 1942, just at the height of his popularity, Miller disbanded his group and volunteered for the U.S. Army, where he formed a military band to help build morale during the war. He was lost during a flight over the channel from England to France in 1944. The plane was never found. 8. Howard Hughes . Sure, all we remember of Hughes is the insanely long fingernails, Kleenex box hats, and storing his own urine in mayonnaise jars, but there was a whole crazy stellar career before that. After the '29 crash, seemingly unfazed, he made ""Hell's Angels"" -- then the most expensive movie ever -- at a cost of $3.8 million. In 1932, at the height of the nation's economic woes, he formed the Hughes Aircraft Company. He built the company into a major-league defense supplier and by the time he died in 1976, his fortune totaled a reported $2.5 billion. Maybe there's something to that whole urine saving thing. 9. Gene Autry . The Great Depression was Gene Autry's golden era. Rising from a local radio yodeler (nearly every station had their own yodeler back then) to a hit machine throughout the decade, Autry appeared in over 40 movies, becoming the top western draw at the box office. The singing cowboy, not content to be just a yodeler, albeit a very successful one, later created a TV and radio broadcasting empire in the Western United States and bought the California Angels. Mental Floss: 7 ridiculous products licensed by MLB . 10. Joe Kennedy . Joe Kennedy, Sr., patriarch of the Camelot clan, built up a tidy sum in the 1920s with a hearty amount of speculation, peppered with insider trading and market manipulation. Unlike many other of his ilk who helped to create the unstable markets that brought about the financial calamities of the '30s however, Kennedy knew when to get out. Out of the stock market, Old Joe invested his money in real estate, liquor, and movie studios, generating gaudy profits and cementing his family's place in the highest financial echelon of American society.

"Washington (CNN) -- A former commander of the elite Blue Angels is being investigated by the Navy for allegations that he tolerated a work environment that violated military policies against sexual harassment, the Navy said in a news release Wednesday. Capt. Gregory McWherter left the Navy's elite flight demonstration squad, based in Pensacola, Florida, in 2012. More recently, he was relieved of his duties as second-in-command at a California naval base and reassigned as the Navy looks into the allegations that reportedly occurred more than two years ago, the Navy said. McWherter is being investigated for allegedly allowing -- and sometimes encouraging -- ""lewd speech, inappropriate comments, and sexually explicit humor"" at work, the statement said. There were also allegations that pornographic pictures were shared at the office and in electronic correspondence. CNN has reached out to McWherter for comment but had not heard back early Thursday morning. The case is the latest involving a U.S. military commander being investigated for violating sexual harassment policies and comes at a time when many have accused the military of not doing enough to address sex crimes and harassment targeting women. ""All Navy leaders, whether assigned to a highly visible unit like the 'Blues,' or to our installations, squadrons, ships and submarines, are held to the highest standards,"" said Vice Adm. David Buss, commander of the Naval Air Forces. The Washington Post first reported McWherter's reassignment Wednesday. The Navy's statement said someone filed a complaint with the Navy inspector general, though it didn't specify when. McWherter was relieved as executive officer of Naval Base Coronado in San Diego on Friday after the investigation ""revealed additional details"" about the alleged atmosphere around the Blue Angels while McWherter was their leader. The McWherter investigation comes to light about a month after a former top U.S. commander in Afghanistan was ordered to pay thousands of dollars but avoided prison time in a case that put a spotlight on the military's handling of sexual misconduct among troops. Army Brig. Gen. Jeffrey Sinclair was told in late March that he'd get a reprimand, and he must forfeit $20,000 and pay restitution of $4,157 related to travel fraud charges, his lawyer, Richard Scheff, told CNN. The most recent Pentagon report on sexual assaults showed that there were estimated to be 26,000 incidents of assault and unwanted sexual contact in 2012, and just over 10% of those were reported.","Capt.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A U.S. destroyer has entered Somali territorial waters in pursuit of a Japanese-owned ship loaded with benzene that was hijacked by pirates over the weekend, military officials said Monday. The destroyer USS Porter, shown in 2006, sank pirate skiffs tied to the stern of the hijacked vessel. The guided-missile destroyer USS Arleigh Burke entered Somali waters with the permission of the troubled transitional government in Mogadishu, U.S. officials said. In recent years, warships have stayed outside the 12-mile limit when chasing pirates. The ongoing operation was confirmed to CNN by two military officials familiar with the details. Gunmen aboard two skiffs hijacked the Panamanian-flagged Golden Mori off the Socotra archipelago, near the Horn of Africa, said Andrew Mwangura, a spokesman for Kenya's Seafarers' Assistance Programme. The Golden Mori radioed for help Sunday night. The Burke's sister ship, the USS Porter, opened fire and sank the pirate skiffs tied to its stern before the Burke took over shadowing the hijacked vessel. When the shots were fired, it was not known the ship was filled with highly flammable benzene. U.S. military officials indicate there is a great deal of concern about the cargo because it is so sensitive. Benzene, which U.S. authorities have declared a known human carcinogen, is used as a solvent and to make plastics and synthetic fabrics. U.S. and NATO warships have been patrolling off the Horn of Africa for several years in an effort to crack down on piracy off Somalia, where a U.N.-backed transitional government is struggling to restore order after 15 years of near-anarchy. In June, the destroyer USS Carter Hall fired warning shots in an attempt to stop a hijacked Danish cargo ship off Somalia, but the American vessel had to turn away when the pirated ship entered Somali waters. In May, a U.S. Navy advisory warned merchant ships to stay at least 200 miles off the Somali coast. But the U.S. Maritime Administration said pirates sometimes issue false distress calls to lure ships closer to shore. The pirates are often armed with automatic rifles and shoulder-fired rockets, according to a recent warning from the agency. ""To date, vessels that increase speed and take evasive maneuvers avoid boarding, while those that slow down are boarded, taken to the Somali coastline and released after successful ransom payment, often after protracted negotiations of as much as 11 weeks,"" it advised. The agency issued a new warning to sailors in the Gulf of Aden, between Somalia and Yemen, after Sunday's hijacking was reported.

"(CNN) -- On Monday, news broke that about 200 girls had been kidnapped from their school in Chibok, in the northeastern state of Borno -- a region at the center of Nigeria's five-year terrorist insurgency. The very next day, the Nigerian military announced that all but nine of the girls had been rescued. This turned out to be untrue. The school's principal and the girls' parents complained that the girls were still missing. In August last year, a military spokesman announced the death of Abubakar Shekau, the leader of Islamist extremist group Boko Haram, at the hands of the military. But like the news of the release of the schoolgirls, it proved to be fiction. 'Misleading sources' Incidents like this have come to shape the way the military is perceived in the wildly unpredictable battle against Boko Haram. Posts on the military's social media accounts regularly boast of ""smoking out"" or ambushing terrorists or recovering weapons -- often written in way that brings to mind Iraq's infamous former information minister under Saddam Hussein, dubbed ""Comical Ali,"" who claimed coalition forces were in retreat even as American tanks rolled almost unchallenged across the country in 2003. Like him they've also ended up pinning the blame for inaccurate reporting on ""misleading"" sources. Even when there is truth to its narratives -- and there have been major successes, including a crackdown that started in early 2013 that killed several top Boko Harem commanders and driven others across the border into Chad, Niger and Cameroon -- the triumphalism seems odd when juxtaposed with the harsh reality of events like the Chibok abduction, or the one at another government school in neighboring Yobe State in February, in which more than fifty schoolboys were murdered in their dormitories, with nary a soldier in sight until several hours later. Perhaps the military resorts to this impulsively buoyant tone because it believes it cannot afford to sound anything otherwise. Or perhaps it's simply because it can get away with it -- because the Nigerian authorities have a long and remarkable history of getting away with anything they say. That tenuous relationship with fact makes it relatively easy for senior government officials to publicly dispute government finances to the tune of billions of dollars; and for an assortment of newspaper headlines to display wildly differing casualty figures the morning after a bombing incident. Death 'cheap and plentiful' And then there's the scale of Nigeria's tragedies. For a country that is not at war, death is cheap and plentiful. So cheap and so sweeping in its audacity that Nigerians readily make jokes about it. That might help explain the trademark blunted edge of Nigerian outrage. If it happens often enough, the mind is soon inured, and eagerly accepting of the sense of resignation that might offer the best protection against the emotional impact of the next cycle of negative breaking news. All of the above combine to create the context in which the Nigerian military -- wielding political power for 29 of Nigeria's first 39 years after independence -- has learned to operate. Not since the civil war, almost 50 years ago, has it been tested this much. The closest it got were the lengthy tours of duty in Liberia and Sierra Leone, in which it played a prominent role at the head of the West African ECOMOG Force, intended more as a ""peacekeeping"" unit than a combat force. Indeed what we are seeing may be evidence of its struggle to adapt to new rules of engagement, fighting an enemy driven by convictions much deeper than those displayed by the pro-democracy activists and diamond-obsessed rebels it contended with in the 1990s; possessing access to sophisticated weapons, and operating in terrain far better suited to insurgents than conventional armies. Abuse claims . The increasing militarization of the troubled zones has since spurred accusations of human rights abuses, from local and international observers. An International Crisis Group report from April 2014 has called for an end to the use of ""heavy-handed military and police methods that risk pushing yet more restless, jobless and frustrated youths into violence and extremism."" Communication strategies also require overhaul. In the age of social media, the military needs to realize that propaganda is now a lot more likely to be found out and discredited. News reports suggest that the military, long hampered by aging hardware, is now acquiring new weapons and equipment. That's heartwarming. In a country where institutional graft is the rule and not the exception, it is crucial to ensure that the military budgets are spent to boost the military's capability, and troops' morale -- and not pocketed by bigwigs. International cooperation also needs to be stepped up; and it does seem that the government is now more willing than ever to work with Europe and America. Nigerians have long been wary of allowing the American military the sort of foothold it has in countries like Yemen and Pakistan, but there's certainly room for more intense cooperation that does not involve abdicating total control. Finally the military will need to prepare to adapt itself to the reality of the government's planned shift to a ""soft"" counter-terrorism strategy, embodied in a document unveiled by National Security Adviser, Sambo Dasuki, a retired Army Colonel, in March. Amid the backlash it has faced recently, the beleaguered military can count on the support of a growing number of Nigerians, who think that it is being under appreciated for the work it is doing. Just this week a ""Support The Nigerian Military"" page launched on Facebook, in honor of ""our military men and women on the field who risk their lives daily to keep us safe.""","Ogunlesi: Nigeria's military has issued incorrect statements in fight against extremists .

"(CNN) -- Eight years after troops in Afghanistan were outfitted with new uniforms, the Army is shopping for a different camouflage for its fatigues and equipment. The move to a different uniform comes after soldiers, many of them redeploying to Afghanistan, began voicing their criticism in the summer of 2009 of the ""universal"" camouflage pattern, introduced in 2004 and meant to be used in all types of battle environments. ""They were saying that they didn't think the color selection was very effective for the terrain in Afghanistan,"" says Col. Bill Cole, the project manager for Soldier Protection and Individual Equipment.  ""Afghanistan's a really diverse country in geographical terms. There are lots of sandy desert areas, but it also has mountainous areas that you would see up in the Alps. It has green irrigated fields that look like Iowa in the summer. It's a very diverse environment and soldiers would often traverse these different areas in one patrol."" The one-size-fits-all approach of the universal pattern wasn't working. Cole says the Army probably knew at the time that the universal pattern wouldn't be perfect for every environment, but didn't realize how much of a compromise it would have to make. Out of the negative feedback came a congressional charge for the Army to find a pattern that was ""suited to the environment of Afghanistan."" Testing began in 2009 and the Army Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC) found that the universal pattern ranked ""in the bottom 10"" compared to the four backgrounds it was tested against. A different brand of camouflage called ""MultiCam"" ranked at the top in the testing, pushing the Army to quickly outfit soldiers with the new uniform pattern. Most soldiers in Afghanistan today are wearing the MultiCam pattern, which has more green and tan hues, according to Cole. Despite the positive results of the MultiCam pattern, the Army thought it could do even better, Cole says. The Army purchase, however, isn't about the latest design in camo fashion, but rather the color coordination and specific pattern placement manufactured by advanced science. ""The direction that we got from the secretary of the Army and the chief of staff of the Army was, 'Yes, answer the congressional direction, but take a more comprehensive look at the Army camouflage need to operate anywhere in the world,'"" Cole says. This time around, the Army is looking for a family of camouflage patterns that can be used across the globe -- one for the desert, another for a wilderness/jungle environment, and a third transitional variant for ""places in the middle,"" Cole says. The patterns would be similar in design but different in color palettes. One leading camouflage designer is hoping his bid to create the family of patterns will be the winning one. When most people look at a military uniform, they probably see a bit of green here, some tan there and a splash of gray to finish it off -- basically, a mixture of colors with no obvious thought to placement or shape. But that perception couldn't be further from the reality of the science behind an advanced camouflage pattern. Although most detail of what goes into making a successful camouflage pattern is proprietary, Guy Cramer says he uses a mathematical equation, or fractal, to trick the eye into thinking it is seeing something else. ""The brain will pick up shapes and it basically categorizes anything it sees,"" Cramer says. ""It says that's a tree. I know what it is and ignore it. The brain does this in milliseconds. So we insert these fractal patterns into the camouflage so that the brain recognizes it and doesn't think what it's seeing is an anomaly. It basically sees the fractal as background noise. Something that belongs in the environment but doesn't need any extra attention."" But camouflage as a science wasn't always so evolved, having started only about 100 years ago.  Even during World War I, some units began the conflict in brightly colored uniforms, making them easy targets for the enemy. ""It started as naturalistic observation, looking at zebra stripes and leopard prints in the wild and trying to figure out what their purpose was,"" says Dr. Timothy O'Neill, a camouflage expert advising the Army on the technical aspects of their search. ""Very gradually over the years the focus shifted in military camouflage to how the human visual system works."" Industry bids for the Army uniform project have been submitted and will be put to the test against current Defense Department camouflage patterns such as those already used by the Marines and the Navy. Cole says that, after extensive testing, his office should be able to present Army leadership with a recommendation by September 2012. Research is expected to cost less than $10 million and is covered under the existing budget, according to Cole. But he could not estimate how much developing the new uniforms would cost, saying it would depend on how quickly the new uniforms were given out.","""Universal"" pattern is not conducive to the varied terrain of Afghanistan .

"(CNN) -- Prepare to meet the young apprentices to China's Masters sensation Guan Tianlang. The 14-year-old stunned the golfing world when he made the halfway cut as the youngest player to enter the prestigious major, finishing as Augusta's leading amateur. But Guan is likely to be just the start as China prepares to unveil its next crop of golfing prodigies at this week's China Open in Tianjin. China's brat pack is led by 12-year-old Ye Wocheng, who tees off as the youngest player in the history of the European Tour on Thursday. Alongside him will be15-year-old Bai Zhengkai, who earned his place in the field after winning the China Junior Match Play Championship, as well as qualifier Dou Zecheng, a relative old-timer at 16 years of age. That trio will all be hoping to follow the headline-grabbing example set by Guan at last month's Masters. ""We're always all helping each other out, and turning to one another for advice,"" explained Ye, who at 12 years and 242 days will beat the record for the youngest competitor at the China Open set by Guan last year. ""I think the main reason for the success of young Chinese players is that we pick up the game at an early age, and we practice really hard. Hopefully that practice can pay off this week."" The Chinese youngsters will be up against the likes of Europe's Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley and Scotland's Ryder Cup player Paul Lawrie at the Binhai Lake course, but if Ye finds that youth is not quite a match for experience he has a secret weapon to hand. ""I always wear my lucky hat out on the course, because it helps me shoot lower,"" Ye, who lives in the industrial city of Donggaun in Guangdong province, explained. ""I played really well the first time I wore it, and have worn it ever since. Hopefully the luck continues this week. ""I'm very happy to be the youngest player on the European Tour, and also a little nervous at the same time. ""My main aim this week is just to go out there and enjoy it; I don't really want to think too much about the result."" Ye is coached by Englishman David Watson, who as a junior played alongside future Ryder Cup players Justin Rose and Lee Westwood. Watson has been coaching in China for the last decade and has been working with Ye since he was nine, describing the teenager's potential as ""limitless"". ""At the moment, I don't believe that Ye has too many close rivals of the same age,"" Watson told the European Tour website. ""The China Open will be tough for him, but we will be ready."" Bai is aiming to be around for the whole weekend at the China Open. ""Hopefully I can make the cut this week -- that is my goal. I've played many practice rounds on the course, and it's very difficult. Some holes against the wind will be very tough to make par on, but all I can do is try my best."" South Africa's defending champion Branden Grace, who tied for 18th in the Masters, is only 24 but is in awe of Chinas' burgeoning talent. ""It's amazing,"" he said. ""I only started playing the game at 11, so I wouldn't like to think what handicap I was playing off when I was 12! ""I spoke to [Ye's] coach and he told me he's been winning almost every amateur tournament he's played in this year. ""So I'll be looking out for his results here this week, as I'm sure will most other people. It's a great story, great for him and for the game of golf in general."" Reprieve for Singh . Meanwhile, the Professional Golf Association (PGA) has cleared three-time major winner Vijay Singh of infringing the Tour's anti-doping policy. The 50-year-old admitted earlier this year to using deer antler spray which contains small extracts of growth hormone IGF-1, a substance listed on the PGA's list of banned products. The PGA sanctioned Singh but the Fijian golfer appealed, saying he did not know the product contained banned substances. The World Anti-Doping Authority (WADA) has since said it no longer considers using deer antler spray to be prohibitive unless it resulted in a positive test. That statement led the PGA to rule that Singh should no longer face a ban, ruling: ""Based on this new information, and given WADA's lead role in interpreting the prohibited list, the Tour deemed it only fair to no longer treat Mr.Singh's use of deer antler spray as a violation.""","Ye Wocheng to make history as the youngest player on the European Tour at China Open .

"(CNN) -- A shipment of Patriot missiles that Finnish authorities found and seized was legal and authorized, the German government said Thursday. A Germany Defense Ministry official said the missiles, found on board the Thor Liberty, were part of a German delivery for South Korea under a longstanding agreement. This was to be the last such delivery, said Lt. Col. Holger Neumann. Earlier, a customs official familiar with the case told CNN the shipment departed December 6 from the German port of Emden. ""The exporters had all necessary permissions, including an export authorization and a special authorization for the export of war weapons,"" the source said. Finnish authorities said Wednesday they had impounded the 69 Patriot missiles and were investigating. Police said they also found explosives and propelling charges aboard the British-flagged cargo ship at the port of Kotka, about 75 miles east of Helsinki. Police said the shipment was headed for Shanghai, China, but Neumann and the customs official said the destination was South Korea. The Patriot is a surface-to-air missile system manufactured by the U.S. company Raytheon and has been sold to various nations. Finnish authorities found the defense materials during a customs search. Authorities found 150 tons of explosives, Finland's National Bureau of Investigation said. In a statement, the bureau said that on Wednesday evening, ""customs apprehended two persons on a suspicion of an export offense"" involving ""defense supplies."" Defense forces were asked to assist in securing and guarding the materials, the bureau said. CNN's Rick Noack and Diana Magnay contributed to this report.","NEW: German Defense Ministry says the shipment was part of a military agreement with South Korea .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Hickory Ridge landfill was once a mountain of trash sitting idle on the outskirts of Atlanta, Georgia. But now, with its 10 acres of solar panels, the old landfill has been given a new lease of ""green"" life. ""When a landfill is (finished with) taking waste, it basically is dormant and there's not a lot of uses for the property,"" says David Stuart, area environmental manager of landfill owners, Republic Services, Inc. ""But its natural attributes -- being a tall structure, out of the shadows of the tree line -- gives it a unique advantage as a solar project,"" he added. The Spectral PowerCap designed by the Carlisle Energy Services is lined with 7,000 flexible solar strips which produces one megawatt of energy. The electricity generated is collected in each panel much like a solar calculator would, says Stuart. But rather than powering a keyboard it goes towards helping power the local grid. Beneath the solar panels, gas pumps have been driven deep into the ground collecting methane gas, which is also used for power production. The liner made of thermoplastic polyurethane is similar to that used on commercial rooftops and is designed to keep water out and methane gas in. As the waste breaks down the liner flexes to maintain a snug fit. Installing the solar panels is initially more expensive than the usual method of closing landfills, but the solar liner pays off with lower maintenance costs. And if there are any problems that happen with the landfill liner system its very visible and very easy to repair. A similar solar landfill project is underway in Madison County, New York where the energy generated from the eight acres of panels is being used to run the recycling center next door. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency there are around 100,000 closed landfills in the U.S. providing thousands of acres of property that could be used for renewable energy development. Many are close to urban areas and power lines. Landfills are a constant reminder of the waste we produce but projects like these could help dispose of the view that they are simply costly eyesores.","Former landfill in the U.S. using solar sheets to power local homes .

"NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN)  -- Quint Davis drives around the fairgrounds in his golf cart. The producer/director checks every nook and cranny the way a field commander checks his troops. Quint Davis is the producer and director of the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival. Davis has been doing this 40 years; he was one of the co-founders of the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival. If you were there the first year of the festival, count yourself among the elite; there were just a few hundred people. This year, organizers expect 400,000 over the two weekends. Despite the sour economy, Jazz Fest remains one of the areas economic mainstays, Davis said. CNN talked with Davis about the festival's early years and its local artists. The following is an edited version of that interview: . CNN: Tell me about the whole evolution of this, 40 years now. What it started out as, how big it was to the community back then, because now it's synonymous with New Orleans. Quint Davis: We really set out to be an indigenous self-celebration [of] the culture -- like the world's greatest backyard barbeque... to celebrate the tradition of New Orleans. And now, after 40 of these festivals, we really have become one of those traditions. We have three generations of festival-goers and now three generations of musicians and cooks whose grandkids are coming out here and playing music. CNN: In the early years, what was it like? Davis: Well, we started the festival in a place called Congo Square, which is very ironically historical because that was the birth of African music in the North American continent and really the birth of the beat that became everything else we know in American music. It was very small; it was the same sort of guts and bones. We had a Cajun-Zydeco stage; we had a little bitty tent with gospel singers in it. Right on the grass, there wasn't even a stage for that one. The Same concept, marching brass bands, Mardi Gras Indians, a little culture fest that was stuck onto a concert hall. We had Mahalia Jackson; we had Duke Ellington; we had big names. We were there for two years, and then we moved out here to the fairgrounds. CNN: And that was a great time in music, 40 years ago. Davis: An interesting thing about the evolution of this festival, being that it's 88 percent New Orleans music. Back in those days, the great musical thing about this festival was discovery. You know, you say, ""Oh, I'll come down. I heard all these great bands. I've never heard of any of them. I'll walk from stage to stage."" Now 40 years later, New Orleans music is at the forefront. Our blues musicians, jazz musicians, Cajun-Zydeco -- even they play at festivals all around the world. CNN: Many artists and fans have described Jazz Fest as a spiritual experience. Is that how you view it when organizing every year? Davis: This festival always has been this sort of battery to recharge yourself, your spirit and your heart and soul. We saw the spirit that was out here after 9/11 [and] Katrina -- four years ago, our entire city was destroyed by a flood. And now more than ever, our festival did what it does, and it showed people the healing power of music. And people came here in a way that was some sum that was greater than the parts, because people here really live on what music does to you. Music is not as much entertainment here as it a medium to make you feel good.","Quint Davis is the producer/director of the New Orleans Jazz Festival .

"Editor's note: In our Behind the Scenes series, CNN correspondents and producers share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events. Tony Acevedo, right, meets with a governor of Mexico in 1945. It was Acevedo who first inspired CNN users. ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- I'll never forget holding World War II medic Tony Acevedo in my arms. He wept and convulsed for more than 10 minutes, his body constricting and tightening in a way I'd never seen before. ""I'm sorry,"" he said, repeating, ""I'm sorry. I want to say more, but I can't."" I held his hand and hugged him until he calmed. I had asked what I thought was a simple question. ""When I say the name Erwin Metz, what comes to your mind?"" That's when the demons of 1945 took over. Metz was one of the Nazi commanders who headed a slave labor camp known as Berga an der Elster, where 350 U.S. soldiers -- 80 of whom had been targeted for being Jewish -- were beaten, starved and forced to work in tunnels at a secret V-2 rocket factory. They worked 10 to 12 hour days with only 400 calories of food, mostly bread made from sawdust. More than 100 soldiers died at the camp or on a forced death march of more than 200 miles. Other Berga survivors had described Metz: ""A real bastard."" ""Butcher of the Earth."" They said he talked with a high-pitched lisp. Behind his back, the soldiers called him Donald Duck. But he wreaked hell on the men. He shot one soldier, Morton Goldstein, through the head, execution-style, according to the survivors. Acevedo described seeing Metz dump ice water on one emaciated soldier. The soldier died of shock moments later. Acevedo catalogued the atrocities in a diary he kept hidden in his pants, using a Sheaffer fountain pen to record what he saw all around. When the soldiers were on their forced death march, Acevedo asked to use his pen for a tracheotomy to save a soldier named George Buddeski. Metz refused.  Flip through the pages of Acevedo's diary » . ""You're going to kill him then,"" Acevedo responded. Metz grabbed a rifle from a guard and cracked the young medic across his face. Acevedo suffered permanent nerve damage from the blow. Buddeski died April 13, 1945, on the death march on what the soldiers call Hell's Highway. The soldiers learned of another death that day: President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. ""Your Jew president has died,"" the Nazis said mockingly. There, in the middle of Germany, the American soldiers bowed their heads. ""We held a prayer service for the repose of his soul,"" Acevedo's diary says. Amid the chaos and death all around them, these men -- these soldiers who suffered so much -- took the time to stop and pray for their president. When CNN first reported Acevedo's story in November, I had no idea it would lead to what I witnessed this weekend: The U.S. Army reversing course on six decades of silence and recognizing the Berga soldiers for what they went through. It's always been a touchy subject for the Army. The U.S. government in 1948 commuted the death sentences of Metz and his superior, Hauptmann Ludwig Merz. The men walked free in the 1950s, one of dozens of convicted war criminals whose sentences were commuted as part of an effort to bolster Germany, which was facing the threat of Soviet expansion. In explaining its decision on the Berga commanders, the War Department said, ""Metz, though guilty of a generally cruel course of conduct toward prisoners, was not directly responsible for the death of any prisoners except one who was killed during the course of an attempt to escape.""  Read the War Department's explanation for commuting their sentences » . That prisoner was Goldstein, the one shot through the head. When you read that document, it doesn't sit too easy. The government excuses the killing of one soldier. Berga soldiers will tell you they were never called to testify against Metz or Merz. They say they could've told of many other atrocities. When Metz and Merz were freed, the survivors felt the Army betrayed the war ethos of ""leave no soldier behind."" They eventually got on with their lives. Many went on to the top of their professions. They're all the most patriotic Americans you'll ever meet. As the survivors reached their 70s and 80s, many began wondering why the government still refused to recognize them. It nagged them. It angered some of them. No ranking Pentagon official had described Berga as a ""slave labor camp."" Heading into last weekend, the six Berga survivors present knew a two-star general was being sent to meet with them. Many were skeptical: What can a general do at this point to make us feel better? Surely, a two-star won't call it a ""slave labor camp"" after all this time. Nah, he'll toe the company line. These were men who'd been disappointed before. They didn't want to set expectations too high this time. But there at the Rosen Centre Hotel in Orlando, Florida, something magical transpired.  See photos of the Berga men being honored » . U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Vincent Boles did a sit-down interview with me, while six Berga survivors -- Samuel Fahrer, 86; Morton Brooks, 83; Sidney Lipson, 85; Peter Iosso, 83; Wallace Carden, 84; and Edward Slotkin, 84 -- watched. ""It wasn't a prison camp. It was a slave labor camp,"" Boles said.  Watch the general set the record straight after six decades » . I was stunned in that moment. I'll even admit I got choked up. I knew history had just been made, the legacy of the Berga soldiers preserved for all time. The men looked on stoically and I knew what they were thinking: ""Drash, pull yourself together! We got a two-star in our presence!"" I was thinking about all that transpired in the last eight months. I thought about Bernard ""Jack"" Vogel and Izzy Cohen, who were forced to stand without food and water for days, pushed to their deaths. Cohen was a 32-year-old father of two young children. I had met with his 90-year-old wife, Florence, and their daughter, Nomi, months before. Florence is a diminutive woman, the epitome of class and grace. She told me a story I'll never forget. When Izzy left for war, he kissed his family goodbye at a train station in California. He looked at her and said, ""Whatever happens happens."" Those were the last words he ever spoke to her. When she was notified Izzy was a prisoner of war on March 16, 1945, one relative shouted, ""That's just like Izzy to take the easy way out of war."" Izzy Cohen died three weeks later, a victim of the Holocaust. Tears filled Florence's eyes as she spoke. She changed the family name, so her son would never be targeted as a Jew. I thought about Martin Vogel, the brother of the man who died with Izzy. Martin called one day in November, crying his eyes out. ""Are you the one who did the story on the medic, Tony Acevedo?"" he said, struggling for words. ""My brother is the one who died in his arms."" Martin Vogel adored his older brother. They were best friends. He entered the Army so he could be just like his brother. They were 19 and 17. He had searched for decades for answers to Bernard's death. ""A month doesn't go by that it doesn't come up in the course of my own thoughts,"" he said. ""But to me, it's always there."" At the time his brother died such a horrific death, Martin Vogel was just a few hundred miles away. He was guarding a POW camp inside Germany where U.S. troops treated their Nazi captives under the Geneva Conventions. To this day, Martin, now 82, can't speak about his brother without crying. More than a dozen other families of Berga victims have reached out. I've listened to each one and put them in touch with Acevedo for answers about their loved ones. I'm not the first to report on Berga. Authors Mitchell Geoffrey Bard, Flint Whitlock and Roger Cohen have written books on it. The late Charles Guggenheim made a documentary about Berga. But what happened in recent months, I can only attribute to the power of online media and the ease of access to communicate. You can scroll through Acevedo's diary and read the War Department document explaining why Metz and Merz were set free. Millions of you read the pieces, e-mailed them around and rallied around these weathered war heroes. It took on a life of its own. Hundreds of you lobbied Rep. Joe Baca, D-California, and Rep. Spencer Bachus, R-Alabama. The two congressmen then pressed Army Secretary Pete Geren to recognize the soldiers. It was humbling when Boles, the two-star general, told me that my reporting and my colleagues on CNN television preserved the men's legacy, culminating with the Army recognizing them. That feels mighty good. It was even more humbling talking with the fellas. They all survived the Battle of the Bulge, when a million young men went head-to-head on the battlefield. It was an honor to see the six survivors present in Orlando receive flags flown over the Pentagon in their honor; Samuel Fahrer was awarded the Bronze Star, one of the nation's highest medals. ""Just as they never left their fallen comrades, we will never leave them,"" Boles said. ""You were good soldiers and you were there for your nation."" I wished the other Berga survivors were there, especially Acevedo. But Acevedo didn't make the trip. His wife is ill. If he was going to leave her side, he felt the right thing would be to get honored in Washington. A soldier with pride. A medic to the end. My final message is to my generation and the next. Don't be so quick to shove grandpa and grandma into a nursing home. Sit down with them. Listen to them. Hear their stories. The greatest generation. They're cut from a different cloth and we're losing them too fast.","Two-star general credits CNN's online reporting in preserving WWII legacy .

"New York (CNN) -- Most New Yorkers believe the city's police act appropriately in dealing with Muslims, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released Tuesday. In the poll, taken amid a tumultuous public debate surrounding the police department's surveillance of Muslims, 58% of respondents found no fault with police actions toward Muslims. And 82% said they believe the antiterrorism efforts of the NYPD have been effective. Overall, 63% said they generally approve of the way the department does its job. The survey questioned 964 registered voters across New York's five boroughs from March 6 through Sunday. ""Voter approval of the way police are handling terrorism is through the roof and overall approval for police in general and for (Police) Commissioner Ray Kelly is undented by criticism,"" said Maurice Carroll, director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. Poll respondents also gave Kelly a 64% approval rating for his leadership of the NYPD, while Mayor Michael Bloomberg got a 67% approval rating for the way he is handling crime. But when asked about the controversial ""stop and frisk"" tactic of police, responses were split: 59% of self-identified white voters approved of the practice, while 68% of self-identified black voters and 52% of self-identified Hispanic voters disapproved. The department's ""stop and frisk"" policy has prompted its own debate over the years, with some claiming it is nothing less than racial profiling targeting minorities. Critics of NYPD treatment of Muslims claim the police are denying Muslims basic civil rights, and perpetrating ethnic and religious profiling. ""It's one of these situations where people are OK with other people being targeted with tactics they would never approve of themselves,"" said Ibrahim Hooper, a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations in response to Tuesday's poll. Polling numbers show that most New Yorkers, 54%, have a positive opinion of Islam, with 65% of those polled saying mainstream Islam is a peaceful religion. Hooper said those numbers are positive, but added, ""Our basic position is that civil and legal rights are guaranteed by the Constitution, and not subject to the changing nature of public opinion in times of crisis and national security."" He added, ""I'd like to see polling data of how people felt about the internment of Japanese-Americans just after Pearl Harbor."" Last month, Kelly addressed reporters amid a flurry of questions about NYPD tactics. ""Our efforts are to protect everyone in New York City, no particular group,"" he said. ""We are continuing to do what we believe necessary to protect the city, pursuant to the law."" The Quinnipiac University poll is based on a random sample of people 18 years of age and older, with a sampling error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points.","58% of respondents to Quinnipiac University poll back NYPD's surveillance of Muslims .

"NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN) -- At 71, two painful back surgeries have left Art Neville walking with a cane and a stiff gait. But if you put him down in front of a keyboard, his eyes light up and his fingers are as nimble as ever. Musician Art Neville relaxes in his longtime home on Valence Street in New Orleans, Louisiana. The name Neville is synonymous with New Orleans sound, the artist having performed on records including the Hawketts' ""Mardi Gras Mambo,"" the Meters' ""Cissy Strut"" and, of course, dozens of recordings with his siblings in the Neville Brothers. Neville has performed at every New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival but one -- and he missed that one only because of a management snafu. CNN caught up with him recently at his longtime home on Valence Street. He was listening to a box set of Sam Cooke, playing some iTunes and bragging about 27-year-old son Ian, who plays guitar. The following is an edited version of that interview: . CNN: You have played everywhere. Is there any place you haven't played that you want to? Art Neville: I don't remember where I played. Going as far as back as I go, I don't remember two days ago. (laughs) CNN: What do you tell people when they [ask], what is the city like? Neville: New Orleans is my home, good, bad, bittersweet. New Orleans is my home, and eventually everything will be straightened out. CNN: When Jazz Fest kicked off 40 years ago, it was for the city, it was for the people. There were New Orleans bands. Do you have memories of these early bands? Neville: It kind of runs together. I don't know if this was Jazz Fest or not, but we were the first band to play Tipitina's. It was before they called it Tipitina's. We were the first band that played in there. And it was the Meters. CNN: The Meters ... so you broke it in with the funk? Neville: Oh yeah, and it was good. I enjoy all the groups that I was involved with. After the Hawketts, the Meters came about. And the Meters turned out to be one of the best groups I played with, back in those days. CNN: What do you think Jazz Fest means to this area? Neville: It's obvious that it means something real serious. [When] it first started out, it was just ... jazz. It was New Orleans artists and people from around this area. Now you have bigger, out-of-state artists coming in, and it turned out to be real good. I just enjoy playing it every year. CNN: How important is Jazz Fest for lifting people's spirits in this economic climate? Neville: The reaction that I see from the crowds ... I'm going through the same thing that they are going through. So we play the music for them, to try to make them smile for a little while or make them laugh or dance. That's great. [I] can't really, I can't explain it. You just feel good. The crowd feels good. I feel good. CNN: One thing about the Jazz and Heritage Fest is the great food. What are some of your favorite Jazz Fest foods? Neville: I like red beans [and rice] with everything in them -- greens, corn bread, potato salad. That's what I used to get for Sunday dinners. That was our Sunday dinner. Both my grandmothers used to cook, they did a great job. Oyster loafs, shrimp loafs, gumbo, stuff like that.","Art Neville has performed at every New Orleans Jazz Fest except for one .

"BANGKOK, Thailand (CNN) -- Fourteen sailors are still missing from a Thai trawler that was sunk last week by the Indian navy as a suspected pirate ship, the vessel's owner said Tuesday. The Indian navy frigate INS Tabar was reported to have battled a ""pirate vessel"" last week. One crewman was found alive after six days adrift in the Gulf of Aden, and one is confirmed dead, said Wicharn Sirichaiekawat, owner of the Ekawat Nava 5. Last week, India's navy reported that the frigate INS Tabar had battled a pirate ""mother vessel"" in the gulf November 18, leaving the ship ablaze and likely sunk. Wicharn said that vessel was his ship, which was in the process of being seized by pirates when it came under fire. Indian authorities insisted that their ship had acted against a pirate vessel that had threatened to attack the Tabar. ""We fired in self-defense and in response to firing upon our vessel. It was a pirate vessel in the international waters, and its stance was aggressive,"" said Commodore Nirad Sinha, a navy spokesman. He said the ship the Tabar fired upon was laden with ammunition.  Watch more about the piracy threat in the region » . Wicharn said the Ekawat Nava 5 was headed from Oman to Yemen to deliver fishing equipment when it was set upon by pirates off the Horn of Africa. The pirates were seizing control of the ship when the Tabar moved in, he said. Wicharn said he learned the fate of his vessel from a Cambodian crew member who survived the gunfire and drifted in the ocean for six days before he was plucked to safety by a passing ship. The sailor was recovering in a hospital in Yemen, he said. Wicharn said his ship made a distress call November 18 as it was chased by pirates in two speedboats, but the connection was lost midway. The owners, Sirichai Fisheries, had not heard from the crew since then. Later that evening, the Indian navy said it encountered a suspected pirate ""mother vessel,"" with two speedboats in tow about 285 nautical miles (525 km) southwest of the Omani port of Salalah. ""Mother vessels"" are often used as mobile bases to ferry pirates and smaller attack boats into deep water. When the Tabar's crew hailed the ship and demanded that it stop for inspection, the pirates threatened to destroy the Indian ship, the ministry reported. ""Pirates were seen roaming on the upper deck of this vessel with guns and rocket-propelled grenade launchers. The vessel continued its threatening calls and subsequently fired upon INS Tabar,"" the ministry said. The Indian frigate returned fire, setting the pirate ship ablaze and setting off explosions on board, the statement said. An international fleet has been patrolling the waters off the Horn of Africa in an effort to crack down on pirates based in largely lawless Somalia.  Map of piracy incidents in 2008 » . Pirates have attacked more than 90 vessels off East Africa this year, according to the International Maritime Bureau's Piracy Reporting Center, which monitors piracy around the world, including a Saudi supertanker captured this month. The latest ship seized was a Yemeni freighter Adina taken last week with a crew of seven on board, including two Yemenis, two Panamanians and three Somalis, security sources in Yemen told CNN. The government is in direct contact with officials in Somalia to work on rescuing the ship, for which the hijackers are seeking a $2 million ransom. Although the pirate takeover of the Saudi supertanker highlights the dangers facing cargo ships navigating the Horn of Africa, marine security experts are warning that racing boats, private charters and luxury yachts can be far easier pirate targets: Rich people usually carry cash and jewels.

"NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN)  -- Of all the amazing New Orleans, Louisiana, musicians, my favorite could be Troy ""Trombone Shorty"" Andrews. Troy ""Trombone Shorty"" Andrews performs on the Gentilly stage at the New Orleans Jazz Festival. He cut his teeth at age 4 playing with legends like Bo Diddley. At 19, he toured with Lenny Kravitz. And now, at age 23, Trombone Shorty is getting ready to play with Aerosmith and release his latest CD. He's played every venue in New Orleans you can think of. I had the chance to catch up with him at the 40th annual New Orleans Jazz Festival this week. The following is an edited version of that interview. CNN: You can't ask for better weather, better crowd, and to be the face of Congo Square. How does it feel? Trombone Shorty: Well, it feels great. I'm happy to be in my city and get a warm reception like that from the audience. And I'm honored to be on the poster this year, because when they first called me, I thought it was a joke. I thought I had to put in at least 20 more years of work. So for me to be one of the youngest on there ever, I'm happy. I'm like a kid in a candy store. I just want to find ways to help the city, and one of the ways to do it is right here at the Jazz Festival. CNN: What does it mean to be here, especially this kind of crowd, on the 40th anniversary [of the festival]? The economy has been bad, but can you put a price tag on what it does to the spirit? TS: Everywhere I go around the world, we have fans of New Orleans. Sometimes we go places, and people don't really know who we are, but they know New Orleans, and once we say we are from New Orleans, we have a lot of supporters. To be here on a wonderful day and to have a big crowd of people coming out to help New Orleans is a wonderful thing. CNN: Tell me about your band, the education you got and these young guys playing with you. What you are going to mean to the city as you age and get the recognition that you deserve? TS:  I just want to spearhead and lead a new style of New Orleans music. A lot of people have been doing the same thing for years, and I just want to be one of the people who create the next 50 years of New Orleans. And my band, most of them I got from NOCA (New Orleans Creative Arts), where Wynton Marsalis, Harry Connick and most of those guys graduated. Some of them I met from Loyola, and we all got together. I was a natural musician first, then I went to school, and I got the best young musicians I saw around town, and we have been playing in this band for nine or 10 years now. CNN: I've seen you the last several years, and you seem much more comfortable as a front man. Not just playing the horn great but leading the crowd, singing. Am I right reading into that? TS:  I wanted to become a better entertainer, and I learned from my brother James Andrews. And I've been studying some tape of James Brown and different people. I've just wanted to see what I could do. I just wanted to make people comfortable with seeing a horn. Because if you see a horn on a poster with some guy, you automatically think it's a sit-down jazz thing. And coming from Treme [New Orleans], everything has been about dancing and second-lining and partying and everything. That's where I am from, so I just wanted to take that and put it with this style of playing. CNN: Tell me what your favorite food is. Do you get to sample a lot of it? TS:  I gotta say the crawfish monica and the crawfish bread. I like that. I eat it every day. Last year I got sick from eating like 10 of them!","Troy ""Trombone Shorty"" Andrews performs at the New Orleans Jazz Festival .

"(CNN) -- Barcelona soccer coach Tito Vilanova is recovering in hospital following surgery to remove a regrown cancerous tumor. The Spanish league leaders' website reported on Thursday that the operation ""went ahead according to schedule."" ""The manager's post-surgery recovery will determine his stay at hospital. In line with the patient's wishes, please respect the privacy and confidentiality of the process,"" the club said. In November 2011, Vilanova had a tumor removed from his parotid gland -- which is at the back of the mouth -- when he was assistant to his predecessor as Barca boss, Pep Guardiola. That operation was thought to have been a success and when Guardiola went on sabbatical, Vilanova took over as coach of the team -- seemingly in good health, but more cancerous cells have been discovered. Vilanova is expected to be hospitalized for three to four days after his surgery and will then have chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment lasting around six weeks, according to Barca's website. Club doctors have said he will still be able to work while his treatment takes place and there are no plans for him to step down. His assistant Jordi Roura will take charge for the weekend clash with Valladolid. At a press conference, club president Sandro Rosell said: ""I want to thank everyone for their support on behalf of the team and Tito. We have complete confidence in the team. The club is very strong and very united, we're capable of overcoming adversity. ""Tito is strong, very strong, he's shown us that and we're convinced that he'll be back with us soon."" Vilanova had told the Barca website earlier this week: ""Being a head manager is difficult, but being an assistant manager isn't easy either. I would say it's more difficult to be an assistant manager than it is to be a head manager."" Under Vilanova's guidance, Barcelona have been unbeatable in the Spanish league -- dropping just two points -- and hold a nine-point lead over second-placed Atletico Madrid, with close rivals Real Madrid 13 points behind the Catalan side. Real responded to the news by expressing their support for Vilanova, in a statement on their official website. They said: ""Real Madrid wish to express their heartfelt support to Barcelona coach, Tito Vilanova, to whom we wish a prompt recovery. Real Madrid extend this support to his club and family."" Barca also finished top of their European Champions League group, suffering just one defeat in six matches. Key to their success this season has been the number of goals Lionel Messi has scored, with the Argentine netting 25 times during the current campaign and 90 times during the calendar year. As a youngster Vilanova was at Barcelona's youth academy -- La Masia -- with Guardiola, though unlike the former Barca captain he failed to graduate to the first team. Vilanova went on to play for some of Spanish football's lesser known clubs -- Figueras, Celta, Badajoz, Mallorca, Lleida, Elche and Gramenet -- before retiring as a player in 2002 and turning to coaching. When the 44-year-old Vilanova was appointed, Barca sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta argued it was ""a logical decision"" because he ""represents the same style of play and the same philosophy."" ""Tito has been working here with us, so why not Tito? He puts in all the hours until he sleeps and he has the personality that we need to lift us. He's different to Pep, but Tito's the one,"" said Zubizarreta. ""We've always looked in house. We have Tito -- it's simple. We needn't go out on the market."" Between 2008 and 2014 with Guardiola and Vilanova as coach and assistant, the Catalan club won 14 trophies, including two Champions League titles. That recent success has been fostered on a tradition of developing their own players at their youth academy. ""Our style of play is so different from the rest of the teams that it's just easier to send out a guy that grew up playing our style football,"" said Vilanova. ""These players train their whole lives as Barca players, with the Barca system. If they play for the first team, it's because we think we can win with them on the pitch."" Since taking charge of Barca, Vilanova has won 23 of his 27 matches in all competitions, suffering just two defeats.","Barcelona coach Tito Vilanova suffers tumor relapse but will stay in post .

"(CNN) -- Three Palestinians, including a Hamas operative, were killed and seven were injured during a confrontation with Israeli military forces in a Jenin refugee camp early Saturday, Palestinian security sources said. A large number of Israeli troops and undercover operatives raided the refugee camp and surrounded a suspected militant's house inside the camp. The troops shot at the house, the sources said, and the suspected militants returned fire. The Israeli military said it was an operation by the Israel Defense Forces and Israel Security Agency to arrest Hamas operative Hamza Abu Alhija. Abu Alhija was wanted for alleged involvement in shooting and bombing attacks against Israel, the Israeli military said. According to Israel, it was Abu Alhija who fired first. ""During the mission, Abu Alhija barricaded himself with other operatives in his house,"" the Israeli military said. ""Abu Alhija opened fire at the forces, wounding two security personnel, and then attempted to escape while continuing to shoot. The security personnel responded with fire."" Abu Alhija was killed in the shooting, Israeli forces said, along with two others. Three of the injured are in critical condition, Palestinian medical sources said.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The famed Roxy Theatre in West Hollywood, California, is filled to capacity on a Wednesday night, and it's only 8:30 p.m. What kind of star could bring out this kind of crowd -- and at such an L.A. early hour? Zee Avi posted her songs on YouTube and attracted the interest of a record label. How about a Malaysian Internet sensation with a debut album that was released one day earlier? Such is the buzz around Zee Avi, a 21st-century chanteuse in the most literal sense. Her spot-on Billie Holiday phrasing and honey-sweet voice would have had her entertaining in a café in the 1930s. In this era, she was discovered on YouTube by an indie rocker -- Patrick Keeler of the Raconteurs -- and is on Jack Johnson's record label, Brushfire, which has partnered with Monotone Records to produce her. Avi's set of engaging acoustic offerings included an enthralling cover of Interpol's ""Slow Hands,"" and was delivered with self-assurance and poise. In an interview two days earlier, she credited her parents and grandfather for inspiring her love of music -- sometimes through karaoke. ""Got to love that,"" she says. Avi, 23, also acknowledges the influence of her native Malaysia, which kept her open to new ways of thinking. ""It's a big melting pot of different cultures. We get a good mix of East and West,"" she says.  Watch the video of ""Bitter Heart"" » . Her love of music -- and of the Malay melting pot -- is reflected in her debut album, ""Zee Avi"" (Brushfire Records). The album, which was released mid-May, fuses early 20th century American standards with modern sounds on songs such as ""Kantoi"" and ""Just You and Me."" CNN spoke to the singer-songwriter just before the album's release. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: You can hear influences on your album from a wide range of artists and eras, from Billie Holiday to Cat Power. How did all of that find its way to you? Zee Avi: Music is universal. With the media and the Internet you can gain access to everything. By listening to many different types of music it gives me many ways to fuse it with my own [ideas] and then I play whatever comes naturally to me. CNN: How did you develop a love for music and develop your particular style? Avi: I think if it's in your blood, it's in your blood. If you love golf, then you would find which wood is good for this and which putter is good for that. It's a passion altogether. Same with music. CNN: What made you want to put those songs on YouTube? Avi: One of my friends missed my first gig. I played my first [original] song ""Poppy."" He's a poet and a writer and I wanted his feedback because I respect his work. So he said to send the song over to him. I didn't know [how to send it], but I did have this webcam on my dad's laptop and one of those call center headsets. So I ended up putting it on YouTube and he watched and I said, ""OK, I'm going to delete it now."" He said, ""No, let it nest there and see what happens."" I remember I got one comment and I was so happy (laughs). Then I put my second video up and got three comments. It just went on from there. CNN: And you got a call from Monotone Records. Avi: One of the guys who worked there messaged me on YouTube. He said, ""Hey, we represent White Stripes, M.I.A., the Shins"" ... and I went ""gasp-gasp-gasp."" He said they were interested in talking to me. Next thing I knew we had a rough draft of the recordings. CNN: What would you be doing right now if there was no Internet? Avi: What would [""Leave Britney alone!"" YouTuber] Chris Crocker be doing right now? (huge laughs) Before the music thing happened, I wanted to study creative writing and philosophy. When I put these songs on YouTube I certainly never meant it to be a marketing tool. I had no expectations of [what it became]. CNN: Musically, the album is almost wistful, but darkness permeates the lyrics. Avi: Everybody has that side of their personality that they don't show anybody. Music is my outlet for that. I also have a positive side -- let's not be a wet blanket. It's not my intention for a song to be [overly] emotive or anything like that. Velvet Underground's ""Who Loves the Sun"" plays a very important part in how I write songs. That song is very ironic. If you're singing along to that song, you're singing this happy melody but you're actually singing about someone with a broken heart. It's sarcasm too, in a way. It's made such an impact on me, like the fact that you can do that [with songwriting]. CNN: Where does the darkness come from? Avi: Most of my songs are about relationships, and as anyone knows relationships aren't always sunshine and rainbows. Even when it's good sometimes it's bad. I try to capture the reality of it. It can be a fairy tale, but it doesn't always end up happily ever after. Fine -- prince marries princess and they live happily ever after. But what's ""after""? CNN: As a self-described woman of simple pleasures, how are you dealing with this new whirlwind lifestyle? Avi: If there's one thing my parents have taught me it's to stay grounded. I always keep that in mind. Whatever success I achieve ... I'm grateful. But I don't expect anything from it.","Zee Avi posted her songs to YouTube, developed following .

"National Harbor, Maryland (CNN) -- It would be a mistake to read too much into the speeches, breakout sessions and late-night parties that took place at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference. Thousands of right-leaning activists made the pilgrimage here this year, to a convention hall outside the nation's capital. They were greeted, as they are every year, by a bevy of candidates, bloggers, political operatives and more than a few hucksters out to make a buck. But it's tough to glean any sweeping insight into the state of the conservative movement just by hanging out at CPAC for a few days and talking to its most rock-ribbed and outspoken partisans. And yet: The confluence of big name Republican speakers -- many of them potential White House contenders -- makes the three-day event impossible to ignore. CPAC crowd chants, 'Run, Sarah, run!' Here are five big takeaways from CPAC 2014: . 1. This is Rand's house: Rand Paul's blowout win in the presidential straw poll Saturday -- he won more than a third of the vote, easily besting second-place finisher Ted Cruz -- cemented his place as the King of CPAC. Rand Paul convincingly wins CPAC straw poll . Paul's address here on Friday, unapologetically heavy with libertarian sentiment, was far and away the best-received speech of the weekend. The room was packed and Paul, wearing jeans, was interrupted repeatedly by standing ovations. After his appearance, he joined his wife, Kelley, across the street from the convention center at a packed restaurant for an open bar happy hour with fired-up supporters. Does his showing mean that Paul will be the GOP nominee in 2016? No. But it does affirm what reporters here had been saying all week: that CPAC is now, without question, his turf. CPAC crowd treats Paul like a rock star . The face of CPAC has become younger in recent years -- it feels a little like spring break for College Republicans -- and more libertarian in the process. Paul also won the straw poll in 2013, and his father, Ron Paul, won in 2010 and 2011. The younger Paul was aided in his win this year by Young Americans for Liberty, which boasted that it recruited almost 500 activists to come to the event and cast ballots. Almost half of the straw poll vote came from 18- to 25-year-olds. Paul's showing this weekend will only add to the perception that he's a top-tier Republican presidential contender who should be taken much more seriously than his father if he runs (and no one thinks he isn't running). The downside? The dominant straw poll raises expectations for his performance next year, when the GOP race for the White House will be in full swing. 2. Obama still conservative enemy No. 1: The national political conversation is already drifting toward 2016. But at CPAC, President Barack Obama was anything but a lame duck. Obama foreign policy target of opportunity at CPAC . Speaker after speaker listed Obama's unforgivable sins: taxes, spending, Obamacare, the IRS scandal, NSA surveillance, and on and on. Strikingly, Hillary Clinton -- the Democratic Party's apparent nominee-in-waiting for 2016 -- went mostly unmentioned until Friday afternoon, the conference's second day. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee criticized the former secretary of state's handling of the 2012 attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya. Her name popped up twice more from the main stage on Saturday. Rep. Michele Bachmann said Clinton will face ""tough questions"" if she runs in 2016. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich called Clinton a ""prison guard"" of the past. But Obama was far and away the chief bogeyman of CPAC. Even as pundits scrutinize Clinton's every move in the context of the next presidential campaign, conservatives aren't yet ready to look beyond the man who still occupies the White House. Perry: Time for a little rebellion . 3. Pragmatists vs. purists: There's always a lot of chatter at CPAC about the various wings of the Republican Party that seem at odds with one another: the free market adherents, the national security hawks, the social conservatives. The growing influence of libertarianism has scrambled how the conservative movement sees itself. But political parties in this country have always been uneasy coalitions of various interests and ideologies. Squabbling is to be expected. The biggest battle in the Republican Party is the one between its pragmatists and its purists. There were hints this year that the pragmatists were gaining ground. In the Obama era, CPAC has earned a reputation for fire-breathing rhetoric and divisive commentary, but some of this year's biggest speeches had a softer edge. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie led the charge in calling for party unity in pursuit of winning elections. He was well received. Perry hoping for a second chance from voters . Paul has called on the party to reach out to minorities and has proposed policy ideas -- including sentencing reform and economic ""freedom zones"" for low-income areas -- to achieve that goal. In a session about libertarianism, one panelist said children would be better raised by gay couples than single parents. No one booed. Even Utah Sen. Mike Lee, a tea party darling, urged the conservative faithful to be more open-minded. ""We as conservatives have got to be far more engaged in finding converts than discarding heretics,"" Lee said on Thursday. But the happy talk couldn't paper over the fact that conservative hard-liners, including several eyeing a 2016 presidential run, don't want conservative ideology to take a back seat to anything. And CPAC still booked a number of divisive and provocative speakers like Donald Trump and Bachmann. Former Sen. Rick Santorum inveighed against win-at-all-costs Republicans -- a comment widely seen as a jab at Christie. And Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas warned Republicans against compromise, painting former GOP presidential nominees Bob Dole, John McCain and Mitt Romney as moderate squishes who lost nationally because they veered from conservative principles. His words drew a stern rebuke from McCain -- and a rare statement from Dole telling Cruz to check his facts. 4. Christie's move to the right has begun: We didn't learn anything new about Christie from his Thursday speech. But it was how he presented himself that mattered -- and the Christie who showed up at CPAC was a far cry from the Christie who ran for re-election in blue-leaning New Jersey last year, winning in resounding fashion. Christie gets warm reception from gathering of the right . That Christie was all about bipartisan legislative compromise, post-Sandy healing, and outreach to voters who don't traditionally feel comfortable with the GOP. His invitation to last year's CPAC was lost in the mail. Christie didn't mind. This year's Christie more resembled the tea party hero of 2009, when he first won the governorship, and 2010, when he traveled the country in rock star fashion campaigning for GOP candidates. Christie reminded the crowd of his opposition to abortion, calling himself ""proudly pro-life."" He bashed unions and the media. He praised the Koch brothers. His speech should put to rest any doubts about his willingness to pivot to the right as he mounts a Republican presidential bid, even as he continues to be dogged by multiple controversies and investigations back home. Christie and his team took his CPAC showing seriously. His top political advisers made the trip with him -- and they presumably left happy. Christie placed fourth in the CPAC straw poll, a finish that beat expectations and made for a nice talking point as he begins the work of repairing his tarnished relationship with conservatives. 5. What's wrong with CPAC? The question popped up again and again in conversations with veteran conference-goers: What's wrong with CPAC this year? The stakes at this year's event felt low -- and so did the energy. There were, of course, the usual hordes of earnest, lanyard-wearing 20-somethings brimming with youthful enthusiasm. But the main ballroom at the Gaylord Convention Center in suburban Maryland was rarely full. Something felt off. CPAC 'Las Vegas' for young conservatives . Maybe it's because the conference is at its most exciting during presidential campaign years, when GOP candidates are jostling for attention from the conservative base. Cruz's comments draw fire from Dole, McCain . Or maybe it's because the tea party activists who arrived here in 2009 and 2010 as conquering insurgents are now just the regular cast of characters and movement hangers-on who show up every year, hawking their wares, snapping pictures with conservative celebrities, recording their podcasts and delivering a familiar litany of warmed-over attacks on Obama. Whatever the reason, there were still plenty of journalists on hand to drink it all in. Thanks to CPAC's proximity to Washington, there always are. But the diplomatic standoff in Ukraine snuffed out the event's usual ability to command the Beltway news cycle. And when Democrats tried to make hay of some of the wackier comments made by speakers, few reporters seemed to care. The headlines instead focused on the potential 2016 candidates who came here road-testing their messages. But aside from Paul, with his happy hour for young activists, the White House wannabes weren't doing much behind-the-scenes to court activists. ""This year is more subdued and doesn't have the kind of vibrant atmosphere of past confabs -- a result of conservatives being lost in the political wilderness for six years without a unifying conservative leader,"" said Dennis Lennox, a GOP activist and operative from Michigan who helped Mitt Romney line up support for the CPAC presidential straw polls in 2007 and 2008. ""It doesn't help that there is not a concerted effort by a likely presidential candidate, especially a dark horse who needs a boost in their profile among the foot soldiers who would be critical to carrying their candidacy in a primary that will be fully under way a year from now,"" he added.","Confluence of big-name Republican speakers makes CPAC impossible to ignore .

"(EW.com) -- When Cameron Diaz, a type-A corporate attorney — you know this because she wears power skirts and taps officiously on a laptop in a skybox office the size of a swimming pool — gets swept off her feet by a dashing businessman (""Game of Thrones'"" Nikolaj Coster-Waldau), it all seems too good to be true. Because of course, it is: It turns out he's got a wife in Connecticut (Leslie Mann) and a barely-legal blond (Sports Illustrated model Kate Upton) in the Hamptons. Mann, a maniac in floral capri pants, actually makes her mannerisms work here; she's so stunned by her husband's betrayal that she latches onto Diaz like a kewpie-doll barnacle, and the movie becomes an inspired oddball buddy comedy for a good half hour, until the pair track down Upton and all three — ''the wife, the lawyer, the boobs'' — join forces to take Coster-Waldau down. That's when the movie (directed by Nick Cassavetes, probably best known for ""The Notebook"") gets sillier, and a lot more slapstick. Yes, the guy's a cheating a**hat, but do we really need Wile E. Coyote tricks like laxatives in his Scotch and female hormones in his morning smoothie? Nikki Minaj, as Diaz's ruthlessly bodacious assistant, and Taylor Kinney, as Mann's sane, handsome brother, both have nice turns, but ""The Other Woman"" really is, in its own broad-strokes way, about just these women, and female friendship. Sisterhood comedies, as rare as they are in the testosterone glut of sequels and superheroes, have been done smarter and better. Still, this one has its own wonky charm and intermittent moments of genuine, depraved hilarity; it's like ""Bridesmaids"" drawn in crayon. Grade: B- . See the original story at EW.com.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- ""Bolt"" is Disney's first animated feature since Pixar guru John Lasseter took over the company's animation division, so it's no surprise the voice cast is loaded with top talent. John Travolta makes his voice actor debut in the title role, ""Hannah Montana"" star Miley Cyrus plays Bolt's owner and friend, and then there's 13-year Disney veteran Mark Walton. Mark Walton poses with his furry alter ego, Rhino, at the ""Bolt"" premiere. Who? Walton provides the voice of Rhino, an irrepressibly gonzo hamster who's Bolt's biggest fan. But he's an animator, not an actor. A story visual development guy, not the star of the show. Portly and balding, Walton is hardly a glamorous Hollywood figure, and yet he's doing press with stars Travolta and Cyrus, walking the red carpet with them and drawing the film's biggest laughs. Walton's journey from schlub to star surprised him as much as anybody, he told CNN.  Watch how Walton brought Rhino to life » . Before the big-name voice actors go into the recording studio, he explained, animators do a kind of rough draft of the film, with temporary voice tracks provided by volunteers within the animation division. ""Some people who had known me here ... [and] knew my personality and my voice decided that I might be a funny match for this crazy, enthusiastic hamster,"" he said, seemingly at ease with a half-dozen camera techs and studio publicists surrounding him at the movie's press junket. ""But, of course, the assumption was always that some professional, big-name actor would be brought in to do the real voice."" Not this time. One by one, name actors were brought in and matched to their characters: Travolta for the earnest, lovable dog star; teen icon and devoted pet owner Cyrus as a dog-loving young actress; wisecracking Susie Essman from ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" as a streetwise cat; and Malcolm McDowell as TV show villain Dr. Calico. But as the film continued to progress from the drawing boards to finished product, Walton stayed in the picture. ""We got to the point where it's like, we can't find an actor to come even close to how good this is,"" recalled Lasseter. ""So of course we're going to give it to him, because ... it's not important how big of a name an actor is, it's about how great the character that's being created, how it jumps off the screen and becomes memorable. That's what it's about."" And Walton's take on Rhino, the creation of his pal and character designer Joe Moshier, was certainly memorable. ""He's seen how I go to the buffets,"" Walton joked about Moshier. ""And he knows how hamsters can stuff a lot of food into their cheeks. ... And I think that knowing how I like food kind of informed the round, kind of chubby, inflated shape of the character, as well as the uneven, kind of crazy, slightly psychotic and googly eyes. I say, you like something about Rhino, I'll take credit for it."" He's getting lots of credit. ""When I heard Rhino, I was like, this guy's hilarious. Who is it?"" said Essman. ""I wanted to know who the actor was, if it was somebody I knew. And they told me it wasn't. I thought that was so cool, that he's just, he's one of the story artists."" Audiences think it's cool too, judging from the reaction at a preview screening filled with kids and adults. Walton's Rhino steals every scene he's in. Walton, who has worked on Disney animated features since 1999's ""Tarzan"" and provided minor voices for ""Home on the Range"" and ""Chicken Little,"" said he'd gladly have stepped aside if a big-name actor had come in and done a better job. ""That's the best thing for the movie,"" he said. ""But there was something very satisfying about knowing that yes, one of us, the little people behind the scenes, who don't always get a lot of attention or notoriety or visibility, could do the part, and that people recognized that.""","Mark Walton was Disney animator who did temporary voice track for ""Bolt""

"(CNN) -- Talk about a ""Transformer.""

Photos from the set show that the 42-year-old has become noticeably skinny in order to portray a literature professor with a gambling problem. The actor's leaner physique was first noticed in January, and he confirmed to ""Extra"" at the time that he was losing the weight for a role. ""I'm trying to get as thin as a possibly can,"" Wahlberg said. ""I was at 195 when I was doing 'Transformers,' and right now I'm at 158. So maybe (I'll go to) 150, 149, (1)45."" Obviously, in order to drop that much weight while filming, Wahlberg's had to commit to a different diet -- one that he admittedly struggled with. ""Anytime I smell food, I get crazy,"" he told ""Extra's"" Maria Menounos. ""My daughter was eating this blueberry scone, and I wanted to like -- I was going to jack her for it. I was literally going to rob my almost 4-year-old daughter for her little blueberry muffin."" Judging from the on-set photos, it looks like Wahlberg was able to stick to his guns.

"(CNN) -- Stephen Kiprotich was born 17 years after Uganda won its first Olympic gold medal. Fast forward another 23 years, and he has the honor of being the African nation's second athlete to triumph on sport's biggest stage. ""I never saw John Akii-Bua run, but there are a lot of memories of him,"" Kiprotich told reporters after claiming a surprise victory in the men's marathon on the final day of London 2012. ""I have been dreaming, 'Can I be like John Akii-Bua?' There is a time for everything, a time to train and a time to relax. I think today I joined the champions, so I am happy."" The late Akii-Bua won Uganda's first Olympic gold at Munich '72, when he triumphed in the 400-meter hurdles. Leo Rwabwogo won boxing silver at the same Games, having won bronze four years earlier in Mexico when Eridadi Mukwanga took home silver. The greatest Olympic distance runner? But until Kiprotich's success on Sunday, its only other podiums were another runnerup placing in the ring for John Mugabi at Moscow '80 and bronze for 400m runner Davis Kamoga at Atlanta '96. Coached by Benjamin Longiross, who placed 62nd for Uganda in the marathon at Seoul '88, Kiprotich denied Kenya -- a country where he has trained in recent years -- a second successive men's title. Two-time world champion Abel Kirui had to make do with silver, while fellow Kenyan Wilson Kipsang claimed bronze. Kiprotich made his move after 38 of the 42 kilometers, bursting clear before taking a Ugandan flag from the crowd as he crossed the finish line in a time of two hours, eight minutes and one second. ""When the race started I thought the Kenyans would win,"" Kiprotich said. ""I kept in touch and then I thought, 'Let me move', so I moved. ""When we came to within three miles, then I started to go on strongly."" Kipsang, who won the London marathon in April, opened up a 21-second lead at one stage but later suffered in the hot conditions. ""When Kipsang and I were together, I thought we were the only ones who would fight for the gold,"" said Kirui, who finished 26 seconds behind Kiprotich. ""I thought I was going to sprint with Kipsang in the final kilometers. Surprisingly, I saw Stephen with us and it was difficult to make a move. ""He stayed with us for a long time and he made a stronger move in the end. We were closing the gap but couldn't catch him. I am happy for him."" The race also featured U.S.-based South Sudanese runner Guor Marial, who finished 47th after entering as an independent competitor.","Uganda wins second gold medal of its Olympic history in men's marathon on Sunday .

"Edmonds, Washington (CNN) -- For Michael Reagan, the portraits always start the same way. ""I do the eyes first so I get this connection with the face,"" he said. ""I am pretty exhausted after a picture. Just try staring at a photograph for five hours without any distractions."" Reagan, a professional artist for 40 years, is known for his vivid etchings of politicians, celebrities and athletes. Today, he has a new subject: fallen members of the military. It all started three years ago when the wife of a Navy corpsman who was killed in Iraq asked Reagan to draw her late husband. Reagan insisted on doing the portrait for free. Then he had a realization. ""I looked at my wife and told her what happened and said, 'Now we need to do them all,' "" Reagan remembered. ""Doing them all"" meant closing his art gallery and reaching out to the families of fallen service members. Most of the troops Reagan draws are U.S. service members killed in Iraq and Afghanistan.  He has recently started drawing portraits for family members of British and Canadian troops killed in those conflicts. Many families were unsure why someone would offer to do a portrait for them at no cost. They wanted to know why someone would volunteer to, as Reagan puts it, ""participate in the worst time of their life."" Slowly, word among military families spread and requests for portraits began pouring in. Reagan, a Vietnam veteran, grew to know the faces of hundreds of troops lost to war. ""It breaks my heart to see young people who have died,"" he said. ""It makes me proud that I get a place in their life."" It is a punishing regimen. Before Reagan puts pencil to paper, he researches the person by reading letters from his or her family and studying the pictures and videos that the family has provided. A portrait takes between five and six hours, not including the research. He tries to complete two each day. So far, Reagan has done more than 2,000 portraits. Keeping up with the requests wears down Reagan, 62, at a time he thought he would be getting ready to retire. A small volunteer group of military families and friends helps him coordinate the portraits and has set up a foundation to bear some of the costs involved. Drawing celebrities and athletes allowed him to make a good living, he said, but with the military portraits, Reagan says he has found his ""true calling."" ""I work with dead people every day,"" Reagan said with a deep sigh. ""A different two every day who have stories, whose families love 'em, whose families are going to miss 'em forever. ""It's what I have assumed as my task."" More than 1,000 U.S. military personnel have been killed in Afghanistan, and more than 4,300 have died in Iraq. The portraits have a profound impact on the families that defies a simple explanation. ""It's not for me, it's for my daughter,"" Astrid Santini said shortly after receiving Reagan's portrait of her daughter and late husband.  ""For her to have in her house someday."" Sgt. Ed Santini was killed by a roadside bomb in Baghdad, Iraq, in 2007, leaving behind Astrid and their 4-year-old daughter, Nayomi. The day the portrait arrived in the mail, Santini was overwhelmed with emotion. ""It's magical,"" she said while gazing at the picture with Nayomi. ""How can one picture make him look alive? Just for one moment, I thought he was here."" Reagan said the impact of his portraits transcends the politics and controversy surrounding war. He is reminded of that every Tuesday when Joe Colgan pulls into Reagan's driveway in a truck decorated with bumper stickers calling for the pullout of troops from Iraq. Reagan, on the other hand, supported the removal of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. Despite their political differences, the two men are friends and close collaborators on the portrait project. Every week, Colgan drives 70 miles round trip to pick up and mail Reagan's portraits.  He carries with him the framed portrait that Reagan drew of Colgan's son Ben, an Army lieutenant killed by a bombing in Iraq in 2003. ""Somehow, the spirit of the person comes through, the soul of the person is right there with the drawing,"" Colgan said. ""I can't explain it."" Reagan also can't explain the effect of his portraits or why a successful artist would suddenly decide to begin drawing pictures of an intensely painful subject, free of charge. It is a journey, he says, that began years ago with his own experience on the battlefield as a young Marine in Vietnam. ""I love drawing pictures, I have always loved it,"" Reagan said.  ""In Vietnam, a lot of the pictures I drew came home when the soldiers and Marines didn't."" He said his personal war experience changed his perspective on life. ""I think anybody who served in combat knows what that is: You come home with the nightmares that never go away,"" Reagan said.  ""Doing this is finally allowing me to come home."" CNN's John Couwels contributed to this report.","Artist Michael Reagan draws portraits of military members killed in Iraq, Afghanistan .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan's military launched a series of airstrikes Thursday against suspected militant hideouts, killing at least 37 people and injuring 18 others in the northern tribal area, the military said. In a statement, the military accused the suspected militants in the Khyber Agency of involvement in recent Islamabad bombings and attacks on Peshawar's police force Tuesday. Fighter jets from the Pakistan air force began the mission early Thursday, and the strikes were ongoing in the afternoon. On April 9, a blast at a fruit market in the Pakistani capital of Islamabad killed at least 26 people and injured dozens more. The blast was close to a bus stop at the entrance of the morning bazaar where vendors arrive early and set up. On Tuesday, six assailants fired on a police van, killing five officers, Pakistan's Geo TV news reported. The attack injured 11 more people.

"Moscow (CNN) -- Of Russia's 12 million immigrants, about 2-3 million of them live in Moscow, according to the U.N. It's a high proportion for a city of 11 million people. In 2013 tensions turned violent with mass street protests and several killings believed to be motivated by nationalist sentiment. Egged on by ethnically Russian residents demanding justice after an Azeri migrant allegedly killed a young Russian man, police made mass arrests of people from the Caucasus or Central Asia. Nationalist groups followed suit, hunting for people with non-Slavic faces, though they planned to do more than just detain them for questions. For a month, police conducted raids at markets throughout Moscow where illegal immigrants were believed to be working. The biggest raid was in October at the Sadovod market, when about 1,000 workers were rounded up by police. The incident was widely covered by Russian media. I saw the opportunity to do something I have always wanted to do -- see what life is like in Russia for migrant workers, or, as they are called here, ""gastarbaiters"". Many of these workers are from my homeland, Tajikistan. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Tajikistan was the hardest hit of the former republics. That fact is still evident today. Nearly half of Tajikistan's GDP comes from money sent home by migrant workers in Russia. The abundance of workers from Tajikistan stems from the ease with which Tajiks can find employment in Russia. All that is required is medical insurance and a work permit. So I pretended to be a migrant from Tajikistan in desperate need of a job. I found a guy named Firuz who worked at the Sadovod market where the biggest raid happened. He agreed to help me get a job as a guest worker. He also told me what the police raid was like, saying that even he was taken to the police station, despite his Russian passport. Police had taken everyone without asking questions, he said. When the detained workers arrived at the station by the busloads, policemen said anyone who did not want to go into the building could give them a bribe and leave. Three people allegedly paid 5,000 rubles ($140) and left, as Firuz and other workers at the market later told me. I repeatedly called Moscow police to check these allegations but the media office refused to give me a reply. Most of the migrants from Central Asia who were caught apparently were released the next day, as they were all working legally, and police had just neglected to check documents before detaining them. It seemed that the raids were more for show than anything else, a bid to show the public that authorities are taking action against illegal immigration. Once I started my job at the market, I had three options: to become a sweeper, a porter or a vendor. I decided to be a porter because it meant more interaction with people. I had to find clients on my own, take their luggage and bring it where they wanted. I got introduced to an elite porter, Sakhovat. I was shocked to discover he could earn 5,000-6,000 rubles (U.S. $170) a day. Most Russians with a higher education don't earn that much. In theory, Sakhovat could get up to 150,000 rubles a month (U.S. $4,500). The key to his success is that he was one of the first porters at Sadovod when it opened and he built up his own client base. It was surprisingly difficult to get a job at the market without connections. My supervisor told me that if he had not known Firuz, he would never have hired me. During the interview, I did my best to be a Tajik, but I spoke Tajik with a thick Russian accent that was hard to disguise. I had spent all my 23 years in Russia and am considered Russian. Fortunately, those 23 years did not give me away. I spent about $100 on a uniform, a permit and a trolley, then got to work. Unfortunately, my cover was blown and guards at the market figured out I was a journalist. I spent only two days there and earned just 500 rubles ($14). I would have never thought that working as a simple porter at the market was so competitive and hard. But it was harder to find a person willing to pay for the service. I was wandering through the aisles, shouting offers of assistance, but nobody responded. It was a rough feeling: you're angry and aching, you feel cold, you want to sleep. You feel devastated. When I came back empty-handed, Firuz started laughing at me. It was funny for him: a Muscovite with a higher education could not cut it as a porter. He told me that it took most migrants several weeks or months to start earning money. He said: ""I am a Russian citizen but nobody hires me because I am Tajik. I have a higher education here, but when they ask about my nationality and I answer honestly, they just hang up."" It must be said too that people at the market were really courteous to each other while I was there, sweepers, vendors, shoppers, porters, everyone. I didn't see anybody fighting or quarrelling. I asked about rights violations but Firuz couldn't recall any. The security guard worked well, punishing those who violated the market's rules. Articles about my experiences appeared in the Moscow Times and also in Russian Reporter magazine. The piece was republished in Tajikistan and even in the Vietnamese press (lots of Vietnamese work in Russia as labor workers too). It was the first undercover report from the market which depicted a real migrant's life by a guy from Central Asia who spent all his life in Moscow. While the debate on illegal migration dominated Moscow, I was able to see the situation from the perspective of the migrants, many of whom end up caught in the crossfire despite being here legally and just struggling to survive like everyone else. If it was hard for me, what about the 17-year-old migrants from Central Asia who don't speak Russian, don't know anyone, who have no money or support? Perhaps we should think about them when we hear politicians calling for tighter restrictions on immigrants, or see nationalists staging rallies in Red Square. The question of illegal migration in Moscow seems nonsense when the difference between a fake and original work permit is just $30. It is a question of prejudice. Unfortunately, a guy from Central Asia is seen the same as illegal migrant, even if he has spent his whole life in Russia. The media sometimes ignites this prejudice. According to the Russian science magazine Scepsis, for the last 10 years the image of undesirable migrants from Central Asia has been cultivated by journalists as an enemy or an interloper. Articles about migrants have been written with a negative focus -- crime, fraud, murder. Migrants were blamed for coming to Russia, for taking jobs that ""belong"" to Russians and living in apartments where Russians should have lived. But migrants themselves are just pieces on a big chess board. The Russian government needs a cheap workforce of migrants, and Tajikistan authorities need Russia because there are no jobs at home. It's a question of mutual aid for two countries. Yet, as long as everybody continues to relate to migrants as mere pawns, the issue will never be resolved. The views expressed in this article are Eradzh Nidoev's alone.","Journalist Eradzh Nidoev pretended to be a migrant worker in a Moscow market .

According to a Facebook Page that appears to be promoting the profile pic switch, this is the Campaign to End Violence Against Children -- Childhood Cartoon Faces.

And not that you need to limit child abuse awareness to a certain time of year, but, at least in the U.S., National Child Abuse Prevention Month isn't until April. Some Facebook commenters have also pointed out the perhaps misdirected effort, posting messages skeptical of any tangible outcomes.

"Philadelphia (CNN) -- Attorney General Eric Holder said Monday that it has become clear new strategies are needed to deal with how police respond to ""active shooter"" situations -- those in which someone with a gun is still on the scene and firing at victims. Shootings like last month's at the Washington Navy Yard have tripled in recent years, Holder told the International Association of Chiefs of Police Conference, and there have been 12 already this year. And he said such shootings have become more deadly -- a 150% increase in the number of people killed over the past four years. ""Although research methods and results vary, it's become clear that new strategies -- and aggressive national response protocols -- must be employed to stop shooters in their tracks,"" Holder told the police chiefs. In the Navy Yard shooting, the police response time was considered extremely fast. D.C. Metro Police Chief Kathy Lanier said her officers were on the scene in seven minutes, which is about half the national average response time. But still, 12 people were killed. Experts say that despite a quick response time, the first officers on the scene often must wait until more highly trained special weapons and tactics teams arrive, and in the interim lives could be lost. Holder said that years of analysis reinforces the need for ""an immediate, aggressive response to active shooters. In order to prevent additional casualties, it is often patrol officers -- not necessarily SWAT teams -- who serve as the tip of the spear in responding to these incidents."" Security consultant Chris Grollnek describes current tactics as, ""Respond once your backup arrives, and use a contact-cover approach so you are not on a suicide mission."" Holder said that police don't always have the luxury to take the time to get their best-trained, best-equipped officers to the scene. ""To save lives, the first officers to arrive must sometimes be the ones to directly engage an active shooter,"" Holder said. ""That's why all law enforcement officers must have the best equipment and most up-to-date training to confront these situations. We owe these officers nothing less."" Grollnek focuses on training regular people how to protect themselves before police arrive at the scene. He says people who work in places where a shooting could happen could use some training, too. ""Get up and move -- do not become a victim, don't be a stationary target,"" he said. ""React by escaping the target."" Holder said the Justice Department has partnered with groups like the IACP to train more than 50,000 front-line officers, more than 7,000 on-scene commanders and more than 3,000 local, state and federal agency heads on how to respond to active shooter situations. And it has joined with other federal agencies, local partners and outside experts to develop guidance for schools, churches, colleges, universities and private citizens on how to prepare for such incidents. Holder also said that the Justice Department has placed an increased emphasis on evaluating threats with the goal of disrupting potential shootings and other violent attacks. The FBI's Behavioral Threat Assessment Center has successfully disrupted hundreds of potential shootings --including 150 this year --Holder said. While Holder pointed to partnerships with the IACG in active shooter response and prevention, there is disagreement on other issues: IACG President Craig Steckler, retired chief of police in Fremont, California, said in his introduction of Holder that the group's membership ""profoundly disagrees"" with the Justice Department's decision not to challenge laws legalizing marijuana in Colorado and Washington state and not taking a stand against legalizing marijuana in California, as that state's Proposition 19 would do. ""This decision by the U.S. Department of Justice, in our view, will open the floodgates for those who want to legalize marijuana throughout the country, those who have the resources to place initiatives and referendums on state ballots and those who've continued to profit from the sale of this unlawful drug,"" Steckler said to applause. Holder said the Department of Justice and law enforcement agencies need ""marriage counseling"" in dealing with some issues.","Holder says tactics for approaching ""active shooter"" situations should change .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A man using a metal detector in a rural English field has uncovered the largest Anglo-Saxon gold hoard ever found -- an ""unprecedented"" treasure that sheds new light on history, archaeologists said Thursday. A gold strip with a Biblical inscription was among the 1,500 pieces unearthed in an English field. The hoard includes 5 kilograms (11 pounds) of gold and 2.5 kilograms (5.5 pounds) of silver. That is more than three times the amount of gold found at Sutton Hoo, one of Britain's most important Anglo-Saxon sites, said the local council in Staffordshire where the latest haul was found. It's an ""incredible collection of material -- absolutely unprecedented,"" said Kevin Leahy, an archaeologist with the Portable Antiquities Scheme, a voluntary group that records finds made by members of the public. ""We've moved into new ground with this material."" Because the find is so large and important, experts haven't been able to say yet how much it is worth. They hope to make a valuation within 13 months, Staffordshire Council said. Watch report on discovered treasure » . The hoard was discovered in July by Englishman Terry Herbert, who was using a metal detector he bought more than a decade ago in a jumble sale for only a few pounds (dollars). He belongs to a local metal detecting club in Staffordshire and was just out enjoying his hobby when he made the find. There was so much gold at the site that Herbert said he was soon seeing it in his sleep. ""Imagine you're at home and somebody just keeps putting money through your letterbox. That's what it was like,"" Herbert told Britain's Press Association. ""As soon as I closed my eyes I saw gold patterns. I didn't think it was ever going to end."" Herbert found 500 items before he called in experts, who then found a further 800 articles in the soil. Officials aren't saying exactly where the gold was found, other than to say it was in Staffordshire, in north-central England. ""Pieces were just literally sat at the top of the soil, at the grass,"" said Ian Wykes, of the county council. He said the hoard had been unearthed by recent plowing. Most of the pieces appear to date from the 7th century, though experts can't agree on when the hoard first entered the ground, Staffordshire Council said. The pieces are almost all war gear, Leahy said. There are very few dress fittings and no feminine dress fittings; there are only two gold buckles, and they were probably used for harness armor, he said. Sword hilt fittings and pieces of helmets, all elaborately decorated, are among the more remarkable finds. ""The quantity of gold is amazing but, more importantly, the craftsmanship is consummate,"" Leahy said. ""This was the very best that the Anglo-Saxon metalworkers could do, and they were very good. Tiny garnets were cut to shape and set in a mass of cells to give a rich, glowing effect; it is stunning."" The items belonged to the elite -- aristocracy or royalty, he said, though it's not clear who the original or final owners were, why they buried it, or when. ""It looks like a collection of trophies, but it is impossible to say if the hoard was the spoils from a single battle or a long and highly successful military career,"" he said. More work will help determine how the hoard came to be buried in the field, Leahy said. Many of the objects are inlaid with garnets, which Leahy called ""stunning"" and ""as good as it gets."" The filigree on the items is ""incredible,"" he said. Some are decorated in an Anglo-Saxon style consisting of strange animals intertwined with each other. That decoration appears on what is believed to be the cheek-piece of a helmet, decorated with a frieze of running, interlaced animals. A strip of gold bearing a Biblical inscription in Latin is one of the most significant and controversial finds, Staffordshire Council said. One expert believes the lettering dates from the 7th or early 8th centuries, but another is sure it dates from the 8th or 9th centuries. The inscription, misspelled in places, is probably from the Book of Numbers and reads: ""Surge domine et dissipentur inimici tui et fugiant qui oderunt te a facie tua,"" or ""Rise up, o Lord, and may thy enemies be dispersed, and let them that hate thee, flee from before thy face."" Regardless of the exact date, the hoard is certainly from a period of great turmoil, when kingdoms with tribal loyalties battled each other in a state of perpetual warfare, experts say. The land was also split along religious lines. Christianity was the principal religion, having gained ground at the expense of local pagan forms of worship, experts said. At least two crosses are among the items in the hoard. The largest is intact, though it has been folded, possibly to make it fit into a small space prior to burial, Staffordshire Council said. The folding may mean it was buried by pagans who had little respect for the Christian symbol, but it may have also been done by Christians who had taken it from someone else's shrine, experts said. The hoard will likely help rewrite history, experts said. ""Earlier finds will be looked at in the context of what we find amongst this mass of material,"" Leahy said. Said Leslie Webster, the former keeper of the Department of Prehistory and Europe at the British Museum, ""This is going to alter our perceptions of Anglo-Saxon England."" Excavation of the field where the hoard was found is now complete, and all items that were found are being held at the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery. The most important objects will go on exhibit from Friday until October 13, after which they will go to the British Museum in London for valuation. Once the items have been valued, Staffordshire Council said it hopes a selection of the pieces can go on temporary display at the Potteries Museum and Art Gallery in Stoke-on-Trent. Once the hoard is sold, the market value of the find will go to Herbert and the owner of the field where the hoard was discovered. The pair have agreed to split the amount.","Amateur metal detectorist found treasure in a field in Staffordshire, England .

"(CNN) -- The backlash over Rolling Stone's cover photo of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev led to the release of new photos of his capture Thursday, images a police photographer said show ""the real Boston bomber."" In contrast to the tousle-haired, placid-looking 19-year-old on the front of the magazine, the new pictures show Tsarnaev emerging from the boat where he was cornered -- his face smeared with blood, his skin ashen in the laser glow from snipers' gun sights. In one, he pulls up his shirt, apparently showing he has no weapon underneath; in another, he slumps across the deck of the trailered boat, his bloodied arm hanging down. The pictures were taken by Massachusetts State Police Sgt. Sean Murphy and published online by Boston Magazine on Thursday afternoon. Boston Marathon Terror Attack: Fast Facts . In a statement accompanying the photos, Murphy called the Rolling Stone cover ""an insult"" and ""hurtful"" to survivors of the April 15 bombings. ""This guy is evil,"" Murphy said. ""This is the real Boston bomber. Not someone fluffed and buffed for the cover of Rolling Stone magazine."" John Wolfson, Boston Magazine's editor in chief, said the magazine has hundreds of similar photos and will publish more in its September issue. He said Murphy was ""conflicted on some level"" about releasing the photos, but ""genuinely worried"" about how the Rolling Stone cover will affect the victims' families. ""I think he was also worried that certain impressionable people might be lured to replicate that by the kind of glamorous-looking photo that is on the Rolling Stone cover,"" Wolfson told CNN's ""The Situation Room."" Woman gets new leg - and new life - after Boston bombings . A Massachusetts State Police spokesman said that the agency had not authorized the photos' release. ""Today's dissemination to Boston Magazine of photographs of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokar Tsarnaev and police activity related to his capture was not authorized by the Massachusetts State Police,"" spokesman David Procopio said in a statement issued Thursday night. ""The department will not release the photographs to media outlets. The State Police will have no further comment on this matter tonight."" Procopio told CNN late Thursday night that Murphy had been relieved of duty for one day and will have a status hearing to determine whether he will be on full duty, restricted duty or suspended during an internal police investigation. The hearing will likely be next week, Procopio said. Murphy could not be immediately reached for comment. Tsarnaev is awaiting trial on federal charges in the Boston Marathon bombings, which killed three people and wounded more than 260 on April 15. In addition, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer was shot to death during the dramatic pursuit of Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan, who was killed during a gun battle with police. Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty. Did missed connections in murder case open door to Boston bombings? Rolling Stone has defended its decision to profile Tsarnaev, whom the same cover called a ""monster."" The magazine said the story ""falls within the traditions of journalism and Rolling Stone's long-standing commitment to serious and thoughtful coverage of the most important political and cultural issues of our day."" But the cover photo has sparked fury on social media and prompted several retail chains to pull the issue from their racks. Still, some people seemed eager to sell it. By Thursday, the eBay auction website listed dozens of copies of the controversial edition of Rolling Stone for sale.

"(CNN) -- Normal service was resumed at the Etihad Stadium on Monday night as Manchester City overcame West Bromwich Albion 3-1 in the English Premier League. After taking one point from their last two matches, City snatched all three to rekindle their title challenge and deepen West Brom's relegation woes. A frantic first 15 minutes saw three goals with Pablo Zabaleta opening the scoring with a diving header in the third minute. The Argentine right-back responded first after goalkeeper Ben Foster had palmed away Sergio Aguero's rasping drive to steer the ball home. Seven minutes later City were two up as Aguero played a neat one-two with Samir Nasri before thumping home a precise low shot past a helpless Foster. Graham Dorrens showed that Sunderland could also finish in style with a superb goal in the 15th minute -- the Scottish midfielder flicking the ball over his shoulder before hitting a volley past keeper Joe Hart. But the Sky Blues restored their two-goal cushion nine minutes before the break when Martin Demichelis was gifted a simple tap-in following a corner kick. In the second half, City continued to dominate but couldn't add to their tally -- a fact that wasn't helped by the departure of David Silva who was stretchered off with an ankle injury in the 65th minute. ""I think we made a very good first 45 minutes -- we scored three goals and had more chances to score,"" City manager Manuel Pellegrini told Sky Sports. ""The second half we were not so clear with the ball but we (got) the result and that's what is important."" The win means City now have 74 points and trail league leaders Liverpool by six points, but they do have a game in hand. Defeat for West Brom keeps them perilously close to the relegation zone in 16th place with 33 points and only four games remaining with West Ham United up nest at the Hawthorns. City, meanwhile, have two testing away fixtures to contemplate. On Sunday, they travel to in-form Crystal Palace who have won their last five games before heading to Goodison Park to face Everton on May 3. Roberto Martinez's side sent David Moyes' Manchester United packing with a 2-0 defeat on Sunday. Several reports in the British media on Monday suggest that Moyes, who took over from Alex Ferguson last year, is on the verge of losing his job with The Telegraph reporting that the 50-year-old Scot has lost the support of owners, the Glazer family. When CNN contacted United for a response to the reports, Phil Townsend, the club's director of communications, said: ""Nothing has happened at all. I don't know where the suggestion has come from.""

"AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (CNN) -- A Dutch shipping company has been in contact with Somali pirates who hijacked a ship with nine crew members as it traveled through the Gulf of Aden on Sunday, a spokesman said Tuesday. Last month French commandoes landed in Somalia and captured a group of pirates. Lars Walder, of Reider Shipping BV, which owns the MV Amiya Scan, revealed the company has been in contact with the hijackers and that none of the crew had been harmed. ""Everybody was fine under the circumstances,"" he said, speaking from Winschoten, Netherlands. ""They were all fine ... [and] were treated quite well."" The ship was anchored off the coast of Somalia, within Somalia's 20-kilometer (12-mile) territorial limit, Walder said. He would not comment on the pirates' demands out of concern for the crew of four Russians and five Filipinos, and would not say whether the shipping company was negotiating with them. He said he assumed the pirate gang was armed but they have not told him how many they are or whether the are associated with any group. The ship, carrying parts of an old oil rig, was chartered by Scan-Trans Shipping, and was traveling from Kenya to Romania, Walder said. It flies under an Antiguan flag. ""Of course, we hope we get our people,"" Walder said. He said that the shipping company had contacted all relevant countries for help, including the Netherlands, Russia, and Somalia. Wary of previous hijackings near the Somali coast, Walder said the MV Amiya Scan had not been traveling within the country's 12-mile (20-kilometer) territorial limit when it was seized. There have been 24 attacks on ships near the Somali coast and in the Gulf of Aden this year, said Capt. Pottengal Mukundan, director of the International Maritime Bureau, which tracks pirate attacks. Of those 24, he said, seven have been successful hijackings. Cyrus Mody of the same bureau said that Somali pirates seem to take ships ""purely for financial gain."" In the seven cases this year, most were resolved with a ransom payment, Mody said, adding that the pirates in Somalia typically treat the crews on the hijacked ships well. Mody added there are at least four distinct pirate groups in the country and it is difficult to tell which group is responsible for which hijacking. A draft resolution introduced to the U.N. Security Council last month would combat Somali hijackings by allowing foreign governments to pursue pirate vessels into Somalia's territorial waters and make arrests. The resolution, sponsored by the United States, Panama, France and Britain, noted that Somalia's transitional government welcomes international assistance. Maritime groups say they hope the resolution is adopted and expanded to other waters.","Somali pirates hijack ship and take nine crew members hostage .

"Washington (CNN) -- It's now official. Starting Tuesday, members of Congress may receive generous health care benefits -- subsidized by Uncle Sam. Most lawmakers accept this insurance -- the same perk afforded to some 8 million federal employees and their families. But Democrats are crying hypocrisy, saying Republicans who want to repeal the health care law for Americans should not accept similar benefits for themselves. ""It's hypocritical when they all voted to undo the bill we did, to repeal the bill that we enacted -- that the president signed into law -- to provide for the first time for many Americans in 2014 access to what we as members of Congress have,"" employer-provided health care, Representative Joseph Crowley, D-New York, told CNN in an interview in his Capitol office. Some 16 House Republicans are in fact opting out of health care benefits, including freshman Representative Joe Walsh, R-Illinois. He told CNN his reason is ""philosophical"" -- saying that he campaigned against the health care law, and on a promise not to accept health care benefits. ""I think that this piece of legislation that we passed is so critical and it will do such harm to our country, that I think we need a few of us to lead by example to point out some of its flaws,"" Walsh said. The Federal Employees Health Benefit Program provides federal employees a wide range of private health care plans to choose from. Though the benefit is subsidized by the government, the cost of the plans are relatively low because the pool of federal workers is so big. That's the same theory behind the so-called exchanges being set up for most Americans as part of the new health care law. Unlike most of Walsh's congressional colleagues who are turning down government benefits, the Illinois freshman did not have alternative health insurance, so he says he bought his own insurance coverage, which has a $5,000 deductible. Walsh says his wife has a pre-existing condition, so insurance would not cover her. Therefore, he says they will pay for the treatment for her ailment, which he declined to disclose, out of pocket. He says that cost is ""sizeable."" ""If I would of taken the congressional plan, I'd taken the group policy, and my wife would have been covered and life would have been a heck of a lot easier. But this is the pledge that I made, it's something my wife and I have thought long and hard about, and it's a principle, and it's important to both of us,"" Walsh said. Representative Bobby Schilling, another GOP freshman from Illinois, is also declining coverage from the Federal Employees Health Benefit plan out of principle, saying he too ran on that promise. Unlike Walsh, Schilling already has insurance that he will keep through his pizza parlor business back home. But in conversations with aides to nearly all the 16 known Republicans not taking health insurance for lawmakers, most are doing so not because of philosophical opposition to government-subsidized health care, but instead because it is most practical for them. Representative Richard Nugent, R-Florida, has COBRA with the help of his state government, since he is a retired sheriff. Others, like Representative Bill Johnson, R-Ohio, are veterans and already receive government benefits through the Veterans Affairs department. And some, like Representative Mike Kelly, R-Pennsylvania, and Representative Daniel Webster, R-Florida, are not accepting the congressional health care benefit because they already have insurance through their own businesses back home. But that decision is costing people like Webster a lot more money. According to his chief of staff, Webster pays $1,200 a month for health insurance for his family, and would only be paying about $400 monthly if he accepted government benefits offered to him as a congressman. ""They all have Plan Bs,"" noted Democrat Joe Crowley. ""The 46 million Americans who don't have insurance today don't have a Plan A."" Still -- regardless of their reasoning -- only a fraction of Republicans who voted to repeal the health care law are forgoing government-subsidized insurance for themselves. Florida Representative Allen West, a Republican freshman elected with significant Tea Party support, is accepting the federal health care benefit. He dismisses Democratic accusations that he and other lawmakers like him are hypocrites. West calls that Democratic ""propaganda."" GOP leadership aides insist there is nothing wrong with lawmakers, including House Speaker John Boehner, accepting government-subsidized health care benefits, since the government is their employer. ""The speaker, like President Obama, Senator Harry Reid and tens of millions of other Americans, gets his health coverage through his employer. That has nothing to do with opposition to Washington Democrats' unconstitutional, job-destroying health care law,"" said Michael Steel, spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner. They may be small in number, but some of Boehner's freshmen GOP colleagues disagree. They say their opposition to the health care law is in fact connected to the government-subsidized insurance offered to them. Representative Paul Gosar, R-Arizona, is a freshman declining the federal benefits for philosophical reasons. According to spokeswoman Stephanie Zimmerman, Gosar has a health savings account for his family, and has seen his premiums increase 30% in the last year. Zimmerman said if Gosar were to opt in to federal health benefits, he would be able to cover his entire family for about $300 a month. Under his current plan, he has to pay approximately $1,700 a month out of pocket. ""He made a promise to his constituents that he would not take members' health benefits because he wanted to live like everyone else in his district,"" Zimmerman said.","16 in GOP won't take federal plan .
But some are already covered .
Democrats call it hypocritical .
Republicans rebut charge ."
"Washington (CNN) -- As Democrats in Congress celebrate a historic number of women elected to their ranks, the White House's top ranks reflect a very different picture -- one that is largely male. CNN has learned President Barack Obama is expected to nominate White House chief of staff Jack Lew as treasury secretary. The likely contenders to replace Lew -- including Ron Klain, who once served as Vice President Joe Biden's chief of staff, and Denis McDonough, a deputy national security adviser -- are all men. Then there's the president's recent choice for defense secretary: former Sen. Chuck Hagel. The preferred choice to replace Hillary Clinton as secretary of state is another man: Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry. The trend troubles those who study the role of women in government. ""What you're hearing is that as new openings come up, there are missed opportunities to bring women in at that level,"" said Debbie Walsh, director of Rutgers University's Center for American Women and Politics, which tracks women in elective office. ""It is concerning at a time when you have a gender gap that put (Obama) over the top, and that gap was a diverse gender gap,"" Walsh said. Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, was believed to be the front-runner for Clinton's job but withdrew her name from consideration. She took heavy criticism from Republicans over her public statements about the deadly attack on the American diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, in September. Obama's Cabinet: Who's in, who's out? Others candidates, such as Michele Flournoy, who served as undersecretary of defense, and Lael Brainard, an undersecretary at the Treasury Department, were bypassed in favor of Hagel and Lew, respectively. Moreover, there are more men than women among names being considered for other Cabinet positions in Obama's second term. The White House stresses a commitment to diversity and points to a number of women named to big jobs led by Clinton, Labor Secretary Hilda Solis, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. Solis on Wednesday resigned from her position and is expected to leave the department around Obama's inauguration later this month. But the administration is looking for a woman to fill the commerce secretary position, two sources familiar with the nomination told CNN. Rebecca Blank is acting commerce secretary but is not expected to be the permanent choice. How women ruled the 2012 election and where the GOP went wrong . The administration also says that more than half of the White House staff is made up of women, many in key senior leadership roles. Contenders for Lew's job, the most powerful staff position in the administration, are both men. Obama's two Supreme Court appointments so far have been women, and White House spokesman Jay Carney said the president speaks with a number of diverse candidates for various positions and selects who he thinks is the right person for the job. ""It's not uniform, it's a broad sentiment and he believes the country is served by a process that does seek out the diverse talent in this country for different positions,"" Carney said this week. Labor Secretary Hilda Solis resigns . Obama has a stronger record so far in this area than his immediate predecessor, Bush. Roughly 36% of Obama's Cabinet are women compared to 19% for Bush in his first term, according to the Women and Politics center at Rutgers. While Obama's record on diversity is also better than the much-discussed 20% female representation in the Senate, he would have to appoint more women to match Bill Clinton's record. Women represented 41% of his Cabinet in his second term. But diversity is more than numbers. It is also about ensuring that female candidates are being considered for a variety of positions, said Jennifer Lawless, director of Women & Politics Institute at American University. ""Nobody believes there's any overt discrimination,"" Lawless said pointing at women who occupy top posts in the Obama administration. ""Defense and Treasury: Those are male-dominated issues and frontiers, and those are the areas where woman still have to shore up their credentials and prove themselves more,"" Lawless said. ""We've reached a point in time where the Cabinets have become increasingly diverse. The next challenge is to make sure we're not pigeonholing women into those positions,"" she said.","Obama's second term Cabinet picks include Jack Lew, Chuck Hagel and John Kerry .
Some worry the trend will derail the president's previous track record of diversity .
Defense and treasury Cabinet spots still a glass ceiling for women ."
"(CNN) -- T-Mobile got aggressive in 2013, positioning itself as the ""UnCarrier"" and actively courting customers of other mobile providers to switch. According to the company, it's working -- at least in terms of adding new customers. The fourth-largest mobile carrier in the United States was also the fastest-growing in 2013, adding 4.4 million customers, T-Mobile said Tuesday during a quarterly call with investors. ""What a year it's been,"" CEO John Legere said. ""We've been extremely busy."" More than 1.6 million of those new customers arrived in the last three months of the 2013 fiscal year, marking the third quarter in a row that T-Mobile added more than 1 million paying users. But it was also the third quarter in a row that the company lost money: $20 million, this time. That reflects the money T-Mobile is spending to attract new users and expand its network, as well as some of the less-expensive plans it's offering to lure all those new customers. Not surprisingly, Legere and other T-Mobile brass weren't emphasizing that part on Tuesday. Instead, they cited the growth numbers again and again. And they do mark a turnaround from the 256,000 customers T-Mobile lost in 2012. Under Legere's brash leadership, the company has taken some unconventional tacks to lure business. In January, T-Mobile offered to pay up to $650 towards customers' early termination fees with other carriers if they switch. (Of course, that was a response to AT&T targeting T-Mobile customers with a similar deal). It rolled out Jump, a program that lets customers upgrade phones twice a year for a small monthly fee, and announced new plans that don't require an annual contract. And it didn't hurt that, last March, T-Mobile became an approved carrier for the iPhone for the first time. ""We changed the way this industry operates and customers responded,"" Legere said. While acknowledging that the highest number of customer defections came from AT&T, the No.1 carrier in the United States, T-Mobile declined to give more detailed figures. ""We're not trying to be too cute about where the customers are coming from,"" Legere said. ""That's not something we're going to get into anymore. As (mobile carriers) are all getting highly competitive, we're not going to give a further road map of where they're coming from."" T-Mobile also expanded its 4G LTE network in 2013. It now covers 209 million people and is in 95 of the top 100 metro areas in the U.S. The company has plans to further expand in 2014, eventually covering more than 250 million potential customers.","T-Mobile added 4.4 million customers in 2013 .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Beneath the cherry blossoms of Shiba Park, more than 2,000 people lined up for a Sunday afternoon march calling for Japan's nuclear power stations to be shut down. A week before, a similar protest -- though in a chilly drizzle, not on a warm, sunny day -- drew about 250. And a month of frustration, desperation and anger boiled over at Tokyo Electric Power Company's headquarters Friday as officials from towns around the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant demanded to know when the crisis that has besieged their farming communities would end. ""The nuclear plant situation needs to be resolved as soon as possible. If not, we farmers will die,"" one of the officials, Iwao Suzuki, told the utility's executives. But the response from Naomi Hirose, the managing director of Japan's largest utility, offered little encouragement to the delegation or the rest of the world. ""There is a need to draw an end to the current situation as soon as possible,"" Hirose said, adding, ""We totally agree to this and are taking the utmost endeavors to contain the radiation."" Since the March 11 earthquake that ravaged northern Japan, workers at Fukushima Daiichi have been struggling to cool down three overheated reactors and keep pools of spent but still potent nuclear fuel from spreading further radioactive contamination across northern Japan. A month into the crisis, the utility acknowledges, there is no end in sight. The problems are so far ""beyond the design capacity"" of the plant that the Japanese are working in uncharted territory, said Michael Friedlander, a former senior operator at U.S. nuclear power plants. ""No nuclear power plant has ever considered the inability to get on long-term core cooling for more than a week, much less three weeks,"" Friedlander said. Some Japanese experts now say the effort is in danger of failing unless Japan seeks more help from international experts to bring it to an end. Tetsunari Iida, an engineer-turned-industry critic, said the situation is ""beyond the reach"" of Japan's closely knit nuclear establishment. ""A real exit strategy has to start with an inspection by the world's top experts on nuclear accidents,"" Iida told reporters at Japan's national press club last week. Engineers and workers so far have managed to stave off a complete meltdown in Fukushima Daiichi's reactors 1-3 and in the spent fuel pool of unit 4. But experts say the overheated fuel rods are likely to have suffered extensive damage, and there is a complication for seemingly every advance. Much of the past week was dominated by the attempt to stop water laced with massive amounts of radioactive particles from pouring into the Pacific Ocean -- water that comes out of the reactors ""screaming with radioactivity,"" Friedlander said. Tokyo Electric is now grappling with where to put the stuff, even dumping thousands of tons of less-radioactive water into the Pacific to make room for it in a reservoir for low-level waste. In a normally functioning plant, coolant water is circulated out of the reactors and chilled. Then it's pumped back in to carry more heat away from the plant's fuel rods, which continue producing energy long after the chain reaction at the heart of the units has been stopped. ""You have to get the recirculation system up and functioning so they can cool that water in the normal way,"" said Gary Was, a nuclear engineering professor at the University of Michigan and a CNN consultant. Normal cooling systems don't require the massive amounts of water -- around 7 metric tons (1,850 gallons) per hour -- now being poured into the reactors. ""That's a big problem,"" Was said. Tokyo Electric officials told CNN they can't say when they'll be able to restore those normal cooling. The first step is to get highly radioactive water out of the flooded basements of the units' turbine plants, then figure out how badly the equipment inside has been damaged. For the first two weeks of the crisis, engineers pumped seawater into the reactors. But the resulting buildup of salt inside has made it harder for coolant to circulate, U.S. nuclear safety officials advised in March. In addition, Was said, the fuel rods are likely in a state of ""partial melt,"" the extent of which will be difficult to determine. After 1979's Three Mile Island accident in Pennsylvania, it took more than two years before operators were able to get a camera into the reactor to examine its condition, he said. Satoshi Sato, a Japanese nuclear industry consultant, called the current line of attack a ""waste of effort."" Plant instruments are likely damaged and unreliable because of the intense heat that was generated, and pumping more water into the reactors is only making the contamination problem worse, he said. ""There is no happy end with their approach,"" Sato told CNN. ""They must change the approach. That's something I'm sure of 100 percent."" After the 1986 Chernobyl accident, the world's worst to date, the Soviet Union encased the plant's damaged reactor in a massive concrete sarcophagus. Iida said Fukushima Daiichi's reactors remain too hot to pour concrete, but he suggested pouring a slurry of minerals and sand over them to carry away heat before encasing them. And Was said the reactors have to be cooled in order to let the molten fuel harden again: ""Only when it solidifies are you sure you can contain it."" He said Tokyo Electric should be in the lead -- ""It's their plant"" -- but he added, ""There's a lot of different areas in which they could benefit from international help."" Japan's government is consulting with experts from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the French nuclear fuel company Areva, said Hidehiko Nishiyama, deputy director-general of Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency and the agency's chief spokesman. U.S. Navy barges have been carrying fresh water to Fukushima Daiichi, and Tokyo's foreign ministry has asked Russia about using a Japanese-built ship outfitted as a floating decontamination plant. ""We already have quite a bit of support from outside countries and organizations,"" Nishiyama said. But he added, ""I think the most urgent issue now is support in whatever form possible with regard to how we can dispose of the cooling water and be able to build a sustainable cooling system."" General Electric which designed the reactors, and Hitachi, which built most of the plant, are also advising the government and Tokyo Electric. GE chief Jeffrey Immelt flew to Japan to consult with Japanese officials and executives last week, and Tokyo has asked Russian officials about using a Japanese-built ship outfitted as a floating decontamination plant. But for now, Japan has ""no choice"" but to continue pouring water into the reactors, Friedlander said. ""I have no doubt that the men and women working at the power plant are indeed going to exert every human effort to make sure that they resolve this,"" he said. ""What I don't know and what I can't tell and the big question mark for me is, will it be done sooner than later? ""And again, my hope is, is that it'll be done sooner. But in order for it to be done sooner, TEPCO's going to have to step up and ask for more help from the international community."" Ailing Chang and CNN's Brian Walker contributed to this report.","No timetable has been crafted for restoring normal cooling, Tokyo Electric says .

"(CNN) -- The e-mail ended with a question that belied the author's pain: ""It's a small world, isn't it?"" Michael Schofield read the message from Elizabeth Baptiste again. Baptiste worked at AT&T, just like him. She had three sons, like him. And her youngest, Michael, was the donor who had changed his life. ""It sent shivers down my body, you know, because you don't expect..."" Schofield's voice, with its lingering Liverpool accent, trails off. Schofield, 53, was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes in 1982. People who have Type 1 diabetes do not produce insulin, a hormone the body needs to convert sugar and starches into energy. Their white blood cells attack and destroy the cells that produce insulin in the pancreas. Like most Type 1 diabetics, Schofield learned to control his diabetes with insulin injections and constant monitoring. But he still experienced hypoglycemic attacks when his blood sugar levels got too low. It was like being in a fog -- one he couldn't escape until someone helped him. If it went on too long, he would lose consciousness. As he got older, Schofield's body adapted to the extreme lows; so when his blood sugar levels dropped below normal, he didn't experience the typical symptoms. In other words, he didn't know he was in danger until he passed out. ""Over time, your body just starts to break down,"" he says. ""They say (diabetes) is a slow killer, and it is."" Tiny cells offer hope . Pancreas transplants for patients such as Schofield are not typically an option because they are difficult to perform, said Dr. Michael Rickels, associate professor of medicine at University of Pennsylvania. But an experimental procedure using the pancreas' islet cells is being tested at medical centers around the country. If it's approved by the Food and Drug Administration, it could make a difference for patients who are no longer able to successfully manage their diabetes. Islet cells contain beta cells that produce insulin, as well as alpha cells that produce a hormone called glucagon. Both are used to regulate the body's glucose, or sugar, levels. In the 1990s, scientists in Alberta, Canada, figured out how to isolate these islets from a deceased donor's pancreas and transplant them into the liver of a diabetic patient. The procedure was dubbed the ""Edmonton Protocol."" Since then, researchers have been trying to improve the survival rate of the cells during transplantation. Most patients who undergo the procedure now need two infusions of islet cells to maintain normal glucose levels long-term. Rickels and his colleagues recently published a study in the journal Diabetes detailing a new protocol, which gives the extracted islets three days to ""rest"" before they're transferred to the living recipient. All of the patients in Rickels' study were able to come off insulin therapy for at least a year after a single transplant. Data from patients in other countries where the procedure has already been approved shows some patients can stop using insulin for anywhere from five to 10 years, Rickels said. Schofield had been following the islet cell research since the 1990s. One Saturday morning, after a particularly bad hypoglycemic attack, he decided to fill out a survey to see whether he qualified for a trial funded by the National Institutes of Health. Two days later, he received a message from the UCSF Medical Center in San Francisco. Schofield flew from his home in Scottsdale, Arizona, to California to learn more about the transplant. Dr. Andrew Posselt, director of the Pancreatic Islet Cell Transplant Program at UCSF, told Schofield that the procedure would take less than two hours and he would be home within two or three days. He would, however, have to remain on immunosuppressant drugs the rest of his life. The drugs prevent the patient's white blood cells from attacking the new islet cells, Posselt explained. The next year was filled with medical tests. Schofield didn't receive a donor pancreas in time to participate in the government trial. But he discovered his employer health insurance would pay for the experimental transplant. His doctors helped him submit a request to the FDA to get the private procedure approved. Now all he needed was a donor. A life cut short . Michael Baptiste was a good kid, his mom, Elizabeth, says. ""Growing up, he was my pain in the butt,"" she remembers with a laugh. ""He was my third child. He was the one who gave me the headaches."" He was also a giving person. When his mom took him to the DMV to get his driver's license, he checked the organ donor box without hesitation. At 23, he was taking responsibility for his life and his family. He was going to school to become an electrician. He worked nights at Home Depot to provide for his 5-year-old daughter, Angelina. He took his mom to Disneyland. ""He was moving up,"" Elizabeth Baptiste says. ""And it was cut short."" On March 25, 2012, Michael Baptiste was goofing off with friends in a restaurant parking lot. He fell out of a car while the driver was doing donuts, and he hit his head. Doctors kept him alive for six days before pronouncing him brain dead. A few days later Schofield, received his first infusion of islet cells. Two weeks later, he was off insulin. He looked down at his glucose monitor one day and saw a flat line for the first time in 30 years. ""That was euphoria,"" he says. He still wears his monitor to this day, enjoying the high looking at the flat line gives him. Schofield sent a note to his anonymous donor's family, thanking them for giving him a second chance at life. He then began speaking publicly about his transplant, urging the FDA to approve the procedure for others in the United States. ""People need to be aware that this is an effective alternative treatment,"" Posselt said. ""Funding is very difficult to get for this kind of procedure in the U.S.; as a result, we're falling behind other countries."" Two human clinical trials are underway in the United States. Once both are completed, researchers will submit the data to the FDA for review. Rickels hopes in the next two to three years, all his and his colleagues' hard work will pay off. Only about 5% of people with diabetes have Type 1, according to the American Diabetes Association. Islet cell transplantation cannot help those with Type 2 diabetes, Posselt said, because they already produce insulin -- their bodies just have a greater resistance to the hormone. ""I think that this procedure can definitely benefit some diabetics, but I don't think it's the panacea for every diabetic,"" he said. Saying thank you . On June 1, Schofield met Elizabeth Baptiste at Pier 39 in San Francisco. She wore a Donald Duck T-shirt to represent her son's favorite Disney character. When she saw Schofield, she waved her hand high in the air and had a flashback to the days when she used to do the same for Michael when he ran off in a crowd. The meeting was a mix of emotions for Schofield. ""It's a happy moment that I got the transplant, got to meet her, say thank you,"" Schofield remembers. ""It's a sad moment because having three children of my own, I can't imagine the pain."" But for Baptiste, it was therapeutic. She hasn't heard from any of her son's other recipients. ""I've told people, 'I know my son is dead,' "" she says. ""But I know other people have his parts, so I know he's still alive. Michael came to me at the right time. ... I needed a hug from my son, and that's what he was there for.""","Islet cell transplantation might offer hope to patients with Type 1 diabetes .

"(CNN) -- The Obama administration will allow technology companies to release more information about the number of government surveillance requests for their customer data, according to an agreement announced Monday. Microsoft, Google, Yahoo, Facebook and Linked-In sued the government last summer in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court seeking to disclose the data as a way to show customers how many snooping requests they receive and are required by court order to comply with. Apple has also made legal filings in support of the companies' lawsuit. Under the agreement, companies will be allowed to publish broad categories of data on government requests for customer information made via national security letters, and orders made by surveillance court, both for general customer data and for content of customer communications. The companies will also be allowed to say how many customer accounts are affected. The detail companies can provide will be limited to groups of a thousand, or 250, depending on which option companies choose to use. The court complaints have been dismissed, a spokeswoman for the companies said in a statement. ""We filed our lawsuits because we believe that the public has a right to know about the volume and types of national security requests we receive,"" the statement said. ""We're pleased the Department of Justice has agreed that we and other providers can disclose this information. While this is a very positive step, we'll continue to encourage Congress to take additional steps to address all of the reforms we believe are needed."" The lawsuit by the companies followed leaks by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden that made public the existence of certain NSA surveillance programs. The government has fought the corporate request, saying even broad numbers would hurt national security. The companies have argued they should be allowed to publish aggregate data, in part to reassure customers. The companies contend their businesses are hurt by any perception they are arms of vast government surveillance. Currently, they can release information on general law-enforcement requests with no specifics. In a January 17 speech at the Justice Department, President Barack Obama signaled his administration was willing to allow the companies to make data public. The night before the speech, tech company lawyers met at the White House with lawyers from the Justice Department and intelligence agencies, according to a government official familiar with the meeting. Deputy Attorney General James Cole, and his chief of staff, David O'Neil, proposed a compromise that prompted the White House to include the issue in the President's speech. Last Thursday and Friday, the company lawyers and Justice Department officials completed terms of their agreement, the official said.","Issue involves U.S. surveillance requests for customer data; controversy arose from Snowden leaks .
Microsoft, Google, Yahoo, Facebook and Linked-In sued the government .
They want to show their customers how many requests come in for information .
Government and companies reach an agreement to resolve differences ."
"New Delhi (CNN) -- Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said Friday that he will step down after his country's national elections due in May. ""In a few months' time, after the general election, I will hand the baton over to a new prime minister,"" Singh told a news conference in New Delhi. The 81-year-old Oxford-educated Singh has been prime minister for India's governing Congress party since May 2004. His move to rule himself out of the race for the top job in this year's general elections didn't surprise political observers. His party suffered a bruising defeat in regional elections in December, billed by the country's news media as an indicator of political trends ahead of the upcoming national vote. ""There's nothing surprising about it.,"" said K.G. Suresh, a political commentator. ""The way the Congress party failed in the semi-finals, it was a settled affair that Dr. Manmohan Singh will not be its face in the general elections."" A rash of corruption scandals has also undermined the reputation of Singh's coalition government over the past few years. Asked if he ever thought of quitting his job, Singh said: ""I never felt like resigning at any time. I have enjoyed doing my work. I have tried to do my work with all honesty, with all sense of integrity."" He sought to downplay allegations of corruption against his administration. ""I have every reason to believe when history is written of the period, we will come out unscathed,"" Singh said. ""This is not to say there were no irregularities. There were irregularities, but the dimensions of the problems have been overstated by the media, by the CAG (Comptroller and Auditor General), sometimes by other entities."" According to a damning report by India's national auditor, the CAG, the national treasury lost as much as $31 billion from the 2008 sale of the wireless frequencies. The scandal rocked Singh's government during its second term, when it also struggled with accusations of large-scale fraud in the sports, real estate and coal sectors. Singh, however, defended his government's record in fighting graft. ""We are deeply committed to the objective of combating corruption,"" he said. ""An array of historical legislations has been enacted to make the work of the government transparent and accountable.""","""I will hand the baton over to a new prime minister,"" Singh says .

"(CNN) -- A military judge has accepted a plea deal that drops the most serious charges against a brigadier general -- formerly one of the top Army commanders in Afghanistan -- who'd been accused of sexual assault, a Fort Bragg spokeswoman told CNN on Monday. In the final case to be resolved, Jeffrey Sinclair is pleading guilty to adultery and mistreating his accuser in a deal that will see the sexual assault and sodomy charges against him dropped, his defense team said. Sinclair earlier this month pleaded guilty to other charges, including committing adultery, engaging in inappropriate relationships with three women, conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman, and obstruction of justice. Prosecutors said he broke military law through sexual relationships -- including threats to some women involved who held lower ranks -- between 2009 and 2012 in Iraq, Afghanistan and Germany, as well as Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and Fort Hood, Texas. Sentencing in the court-martial at Fort Bragg was scheduled for Monday afternoon. Defense attorney Richard Scheff applauded the deal in the last case Sunday while attacking the Pentagon, which the defense has accused of interfering, and Sinclair's accuser in that case, an Army captain the defense has painted as a jilted lover who was upset that the general wouldn't leave his wife. ""After wasting millions of taxpayer dollars, the Army finally admitted what it's known for many months: General Sinclair is innocent of sexual assault. Two successive prosecutors agreed that these charges should be dropped, as did two successive staff judge advocates,"" Scheff said in a statement. He continued: ""The government understood that if it allowed BG Sinclair's accuser to be cross-examined, she would be caught in a thick web of her own lies. It shouldn't have taken two years for them to come to this conclusion, but they were driven by politics rather than justice."" According to defense team spokesman Josh Zeitz, Sinclair and the government agreed to a maximum cap on penalties, and the general will receive the lesser of two sentences: either the terms agreed upon by the defense and prosecution, or the sentence issued by the military judge. The deal conforms to what Zeitz earlier said was Sinclair's condition for a plea deal: None of the charges to which he's pleading guilty will land him on a sex offender registry. Scheff said that the ""reputational and financial costs"" Sinclair has suffered because of ""false rape allegations"" should be factored into his sentencing. The testimony of the general's accuser in the final case was never fully aired. She testified for several hours on March 7, telling the court that the affair started with intimate exchanges and evolved into groping and demands for sex and oral sex, CNN affiliate WTVD reported. She also said the general threatened to kill her and her family, the station reported. She was scheduled to continue her testimony on March 10, but Col. James Pohl, the presiding judge in the court-martial, dismissed the jury after 22 pages of e-mails emerged that appear to point to alleged Pentagon interference in the case. At least one of the e-mails also seemed to indicate that a senior Army official felt the accuser had a credibility issue. While Pohl said there may have been ""undue command influence"" by Pentagon officials, he declined the defense team's request that he drop charges against Sinclair. Pohl instead ordered that the general be provided a possible plea deal. The defense team said Sunday that the plea deal put a stop to all three charges that would necessitate sex offender status for Sinclair, as well as a charge of defrauding the government and a charge that alleged ""Sinclair 'coerced and compelled' his accuser to remain in their three-year, consensual relationship."" The 27-year Army veteran will instead agree that his failure to end the relationship resulted in his accuser's emotional discomfort and distress, as did his refusal to divorce his wife and marry his accuser, the defense statement said. The general will also plead guilty to mistreating his accuser, which the defense team noted is ""an infraction unique to the Uniform Code of Military Justice."" Retired Rear Adm. Jamie Barnett, the accuser's attorney, said Monday that ""our client stands by her sworn testimony in open court that Gen. Sinclair sexually assaulted her."" ""Gen. Sinclair has just pleaded guilty to multiple charges that clearly undermine his integrity and honesty for at least the last five years of his career,"" Barnett said in an e-mailed statement. ""The strength of (our client's) testimony convicted him. It is ludicrous for his attorneys to claim, completely without support, that the charges of sexual assault were false."" Once the deputy commander of the Army's 82nd Airborne Division, Sinclair was moved to the North Carolina post from Afghanistan in 2012, the same year the last alleged incidents occurred and when he was originally charged. Sinclair's attorneys filed a Freedom of Information Act request for all Pentagon e-mail communication including keywords in the Sinclair case, identifying about 10,000 e-mails among a dozen senior Pentagon officials, Zeitz said. The Pentagon was reviewing the communications and would probably release them slowly, Zeitz said last week, but if something pivotal arose in those e-mails, the defense would file another motion to dismiss charges.","Sexual assault and sodomy charges against Brig.

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Heavy gunfire reverberated in central Cairo before dawn Thursday as supporters and foes of embattled Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak continued to face off at Tahrir Square, where chunks of concretes and Molotov cocktails were employed as weapons in the escalating crisis. CNN personnel saw wounded people being carried into Tahrir Square, largely held by anti-regime demonstrators, through an entrance that leads to the nearby Egyptian Museum. Several ambulances entered and left the square shortly before 4 a.m. Thursday. The source of the gunfire was not immediately known. Voices were heard chanting a prayer after a day of violent street battles in central Cairo. Sustained automatic weapons fire, including from what sounded like a heavy machine gun, echoed around the square, the epicenter of nine days of protests calling for Mubarak's ouster. Anti-government demonstrators hunkered down behind makeshift barricades in the square and outside the nearby national museum against the onslaught, which demonstrators said included plainclothes police officers. ""They're coming in with weapons. They're spreading violence,"" human rights activist Gigi Ibrahim told CNN on Wednesday. ""We've had peaceful protests here since Friday and no violence here. Only today were we faced with this really violent reaction."" The pro-government protesters were not impeded by the army when they entered the square, CNN's Ben Wedeman said early Thursday. Anti-regime protesters are now unhappy with troops, whose commanders had promised Monday not to use force against peaceful demonstrations, for standing by, he said. Small fires burned in the square early Thursday, some spreading to trees and walls. Egypt's health ministry reported four people were killed and 829 were wounded in Wednesday's clashes, according to the state television network. Reported fatalities in the previous eight days of demonstrations ranged as high as 300, but CNN has not been able to independently confirm the death toll. In one surreal moment, whip-wielding Mubarak supporters thundered through the crowd astride horses and camels, and at least one man was pulled off his mount and beaten. A Mubarak supporter who spoke to CNN said the riders were pyramid workers who were protesting the negative economic impact of the crisis. ""What you are seeing is the demonstration of the real Egyptian people who are trying to take back their country, trying to take back their street,"" said businessman Khaled Ahmed, who described himself as ""pro-Egyptian."" But some observers said the pro-Mubarak push Wednesday was likely orchestrated by a regime bent on breaking up peaceful demonstrations. ""These are tactics that are well-known in Egypt,"" Michele Dunne, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told CNN's John King. Robert Kagan of the Brookings Institution said the ""rent-a-thugs"" were likely sanctioned and paid by the government. This is meant to create an image of chaos so the government can move in to restore order, he said. ""Mubarak has -- now, certainly, with the violence today, but even before that -- lost the confidence of the overwhelming number of the Egyptian people,"" Kagan said. As night fell, the sound of gunfire reverberated in Tahrir Square, the name of which means ""liberation"" in Arabic. People hurled verbal insults, Molotov cocktails, rocks and anything else they could find -- shards of metal, sticks, shoes -- at one another. Desperate for more ammunition, they dismantled sidewalks and picked up chunks of cement to throw. They beat each other in what rapidly spiraled into utter mayhem. Hundreds of injured people were treated by doctors and medical staff, who turned to volunteers for assistance. CNN iReporter Hunter Moore, 26, helped treat the wounded. The U.S. schoolteacher said Tuesday's crowds at Tahrir Square were mostly peaceful. ""It went downhill really, really quickly"" on Wednesday, he told CNN. It was unclear whether such confrontations were being repeated elsewhere. Other Cairo neighborhoods were calm, and rallies in Egypt's second-largest city, Alexandria, were largely peaceful. Mubarak's opponents had stood shoulder to shoulder in Tahrir Square to call for his immediate resignation in a massive rally on Tuesday. The 82-year-old president's announcement that night that he would spend the remaining seven months of his current term working to ensure a ""peaceful transition of power"" failed to satisfy them, and they vowed to keep up the pressure on him to resign. The crisis has paralyzed the Egyptian economy, as the government has closed banks, idled trains and shuttered schools. Markets are running short of basic food staples, and the situation is hurting the ability of ordinary citizens to join the demonstrations, opposition activist Ziad Aly told CNN. ""We can't get enough bread. We can't get enough food supplies,"" he said. Vice President Omar Suleiman reiterated the government stance that the people have been heard, that they should go home and that they should stop demonstrating. Protesters should respect the curfew and ""enable people to return to their jobs and their daily lives, and to allow schools and universities to reopen,"" he said in a statement. The state-run television network, Nile TV, sought to portray the unrest as a ""foreign conspiracy"" fueled by international journalists, several of whom -- including CNN's Anderson Cooper -- were attacked during Wednesday's clashes. Despite reports that shots had been fired, Nile TV's reporters denied any shooting had taken place or even that violence had broken out in Tahrir Square. The network also said that members of the opposition Muslim Brotherhood were heading to the square ""to throw balls of fire and to start acts of riots and violence."" When asked if that were true, Mohamed Morsy, a spokesman for the Muslim Brotherhood, said the action came from all segments of the Egyptian people, ""not the Muslim Brotherhood only."" Morsy told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that the time for change is now, not when Mubarak's term ends. ""We need a new era, a new regime,"" Morsy said. ""We have a constitution."" Asked whether Suleiman could lead the government until new elections, Morsy said the head of the country's supreme court should fulfill that role. In Washington, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said an end to violence was ""imperative."" ""It is our hope that what we saw today, we won't see tomorrow or Friday or into the weekend,"" he said. But Mubarak's government bluntly told outsiders to mind their own business. ""Our interactions within our country are Egyptian affairs and nothing more than that,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Hossam Zaki said. Egypt ""will continue to be a beacon of moderation and stability in our region,"" he said, but its people must settle their differences without ""intervention from the outside."" Though Mubarak's concessions were large and remarkable for a man who has held a tight grip on power for three decades, it was too little, too late for many Egyptians. ""He is unfortunately going to continue the agony for another six or seven months,"" opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei said Tuesday night. However, Mubarak supporter Waleed Tawfik told CNN that not all Egyptians agree that Mubarak should step down immediately. ""Change will not happen overnight. There's not a magical button for change. Change will take time,"" he said. The Egyptian army can't sit on the sidelines too much longer, or it could risk unraveling, said a foreign policy expert. The army needs to pick a course of action by Friday, when more mass protests are expected after prayers, Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, told CNN's ""Parker Spitzer."" The Egyptian crisis is among the aftershocks of the revolt in Tunisia that forced that nation's longtime strongman to flee to Saudi Arabia in mid-January. In Yemen, President Ali Abdullah Saleh -- who has been in office for 32 years -- said Wednesday he will not run for president nor hand over power to his son once his current term ends in 2013. CNN's Ben Wedeman, Frederik Pleitgen, Ivan Watson, Tommy Evans, Saad Abedine, Hala Gorani, Amir Ahmed, Jomana Karadsheh and Arwa Damon contributed to this report .","Several wounded people are taken into Cairo square after new gunfire .

"(CNN) -- The Lunar New Year gallops ever closer and with it the world's largest human migration. The Year of the Horse will stretch China's transport system to its limit. Officials are expecting people to go on 3.62 billion journeys -- 200 million more than last year. China's state-run news agency Xinhua says 42 million of those trips will be by air, as more cash-rich mainlanders turn their backs on the traditional extended family reunion to celebrate the most important festival of the year abroad. They're part of a sharp, upward trend in globetrotting. The Chinese travel and spend more than anyone else on the planet. They shelled out $102 billion on 83 million trips in 2012, according to the United Nations; and they'll continue to dominate the market. By 2020, more than 200 million Chinese will go overseas, according to a report from Asia-Pacific brokerage firm CLSA -- double the number that did in 2013. This explosion is due in part to higher wages, more annual leave and easier visas. ""Mainlanders are rapidly switching travel to overseas to explore new cultures, shop, gamble and escape the overcrowded domestic tourist sites and worsening pollution,"" Aaron Fischer, head of consumer and gaming research at CLSA and the report's author, told CNN. Here's a look at how some tourist hubs in the Asia-Pacific region are scrambling to capture a slice of this lucrative market. Bali, Indonesia . The number of Chinese arrivals on the island during ""Golden Week"" could reach 1000 a day, thanks to a new direct flight between Beijing and Bali. Around 30,000 Chinese tourists are expected to hop onto the Hainan Airline route -- which started on January 15 -- and pump $90 million into the economy during the festive season. Not to be outdone, hundreds of miles away West Javan provincial officials told the Jakarta Post they're prioritizing the Chinese tourist market. They're urging the local hospitality industry to improve workers' skills and upgrade infrastructure at main tourist sites, such as erecting signs in Mandarin. Attracting deep Chinese pockets is central to Indonesia's national tourism strategy. The country launched a Chinese-language website in November and aims to bump up the numbers of Chinese arrivals by 37% to 1 million by the end of 2014. Japan . Japan's weak yen, great cuisine, cultural and natural heritage are hooking wealthier Chinese. Popular items to buy include Louis Vuitton bags and $1000 rice cookers, according to TravelZoo Asia-Pacific. The website said 29% of Chinese with an annual household income of roughly $50,000 ranked Japan as their number one travel destination. But the overall number of Chinese traveling to Japan has slipped by 11% since 2012, deterred by regional animosity between Asia's number one and two economies. Critics also say that more could be made of ""Cool Japan,"" the brand that put a stamp on Japan as a cultural powerhouse in 2002. They want a concerted national strategy to hit Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's target of 30 million foreign visitors by 2020. Australia . Chinese herbal tea sachets, Chinese TV channels and disposable slippers -- just some of the things that Australian tourist officials recommend hoteliers make available to the Chinese tourist in the land of sunshine. Chinese tourists added $4.04 billion to the Australian economy last year, rivaling New Zealand as the number one source market in spending power. However, Chinese arrivals fell 9.4% in November from a year earlier, sending ripples of concern through the Australian travel industry. The government says this could be due to a law introduced by Beijing last October banning tour companies from operating low-cost shopping tours abroad. Despite the November fall, Chinese arrivals and spending are up at around 16% for the past 12 months, according to Leo Seaton, Manager of Media Relations for Tourism Australia. ""Feedback so far suggests a tale of two markets -- declines in the group market, being offset by a robust independent, higher-spending, traveler market, enjoying higher quality visitor experiences,"" Seaton told CNN. Philippines . The Philippines is also a winner, with 18% more Chinese tourists visited the archipelago in 2013 than in 2012. The country's tourism department has deemed 2015 the ""Visit Philippines Year,"" adding to the upbeat ""It's More Fun in the Philippines"" campaign. The easing of air traffic agreements between the Philippines, its regional neighbors and China may help boost numbers. Meanwhile, the Shanghai Morning Post newspaper recently named the Philippines the ""Best Tropical Island Destination."" The Philippines' Department of Foreign Affairs says the number of Chinese arrivals is growing by around 70% year-on-year. This breakneck pace of growth comes despite a territorial dispute between the two countries. Thailand . Thailand is losing some of its appeal among Chinese travelers amid anti-government protests that have disrupted life in the capital, Bangkok. The tourism authority stresses that it is business as usual in the Chinese tourist's favorite foreign destination after Hong Kong and Macao, despite a state of emergency afflicting the capital. But Bert van Walbeek, chairman of the Thai chapter of the Pacific Asia Travel Association, told CNN there are likely to be 60-70% fewer Chinese tourists landing in Thailand for the Year of the Horse. Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai and Pattaya have profited as tourists venture away from Bangkok. But Van Walbeek's overall prediction was upbeat. ""As with all crises in Thailand there has been a temporary glitch. Whatever they do to Thailand, the country will bounce back,"" he said. Last year's bumper figures may be hard to match. Around 3 million Chinese tourists trotted into Thailand, seduced by its beaches, food, shopping, nightlife and the box office hit film, ""Lost in Thailand"" about a mismatched pair on a journey of self-discovery.","Chinese tourists travel and spend more than anyone else .

"(CNN) -- A Colorado judge Tuesday threw out Tim Masters' 1999 murder conviction after DNA evidence pointed to another suspect, and Masters was freed after spending nine years behind bars. Tim Masters, center, walks out of a Fort Collins, Colorado, courthouse Tuesday with his attorney David Wymore. Cheers and applause erupted as Masters walked out of court with his attorneys David Wymore and Maria Liu. A jury convicted Masters 12 years after the discovery of the mutilated corpse of Peggy Hettrick, 37, in a field near his trailer. Masters was 15 at the time of the slaying. Now 36, Masters wore new clothes bought by his lawyers for Tuesday's hearing. He appeared dazed and elated.  Watch Masters' first minutes of freedom » . ""They did a fantastic job,"" Masters said of his attorneys at a hastily convened news conference. ""I want to go see my family,"" he said. Wymore said he would ""urge the prosecutors to dismiss all charges as soon as possible."" He added, ""It's an opportunity to do the right thing."" Wymore thanked former Fort Collins investigator Linda Wheeler-Holloway, who came forward with her doubts about the conviction. He also thanked journalists ""for not letting it sink into a dark hole."" Surrounded by police officers and his attorneys, Masters left the second-floor jury room and walked to the main floor of the Larimer County Justice Center amid a flurry of flashes and shutter clicks. Police cleared a path as the smiling Masters walked outside onto icy courthouse steps and squinted as the sunlight hit him in the face. He and his attorneys got into a waiting vehicle, which quickly drove away. A special prosecutor who reviewed how the 1999 case was handled made the request to vacate the conviction, citing new DNA evidence that points to someone else in Hettrick's slaying. Judge Joseph Weatherby quickly granted the request. Masters was freed on his own recognizance, which means his family does not have to put up any money or property. Watch Masters' first minutes of freedom » . Masters had been under investigation for the slaying for more than half his life. A passing cyclist discovered the mutilated body of Hettrick near Masters' home. Masters has said since February 12, 1987 -- the day after the killing -- that he did not commit the crime. Watch police question 15-year-old Masters . Police mounted an investigation that ultimately saw Masters jailed in 1998 and sentenced to life in prison for murder in 1999. On Friday, after months of hearings in which Masters' new defense team alleged police and prosecutorial misdeeds in the investigation and trial, special prosecutor Don Quick delivered what was likely the best news of Masters' life. A defense-commissioned DNA test -- subsequently backed by the Colorado Bureau of Investigation -- pointed to ""a potential suspect in the early investigation of Peggy Hettrick's murder,"" Quick said in a news conference. However, Quick did not say the evidence vindicated Masters, only that it met ""the constitutional requirements"" for a new trial. After the special prosecutor announced Friday that new DNA evidence in the case warranted a retrial, District Attorney Larry Abrahamson issued a statement Monday explaining it might be unnecessary to try Masters again. ""In light of newly discovered evidence revealed to me on Friday,"" Abrahamson wrote, ""I will be moving as expeditiously as possible to make the determination of whether all charges against Timothy Masters will be dismissed."" Abrahamson said he also will review all ""contested convictions"" in which advances in DNA testing may prove useful. He said he wanted to review the discovery process and that he had met with the Fort Collins police chief and his officers ""to discuss the critical flow of information with assurance that all information is available to our office and the defense."" The statement is noteworthy since Masters' attorneys allege Fort Collins police and prosecutors withheld evidence favorable to their client during his 1999 trial. Quick filed a motion this month citing four instances in which police and prosecutors should have handed over evidence to Masters' original defense team. See the key players in the case » . Among them was a police interview with a plastic surgeon who said it was improbable that a teen could have made the meticulous cuts necessary to remove Hettrick's body parts. Also, according to Quick's motion, police failed to divulge that a renowned FBI profiler warned police that Masters' penchant for doodling gruesome horror scenes did not tie him to the crime. Those sketches, along with a collection of narratives and knives, helped convince the jury of Masters' guilt. No physical evidence was found tying Masters to the crime. With charges against Masters now dismissed, the investigation likely will focus on the new DNA evidence, Quick said. Authorities have the partial DNA profiles of three men, one of them matching a full DNA profile provided by the defense. But even with the DNA evidence, many questions remain: To whom do the other partial profiles belong? How did the physical evidence arrive on Hettrick's clothing? How long has it been there? And ultimately, who killed her? ""I'm hoping for both Mr. Masters and the Hettrick family that we can answer those questions,"" Quick said.

"(CNN) -- When is a website crash not a crash? That question has been on the minds of many since the government official responsible for the beleaguered HealthCare.gov site testified Wednesday before Congress. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius apologized and took responsibility for what she called ""miserably frustrating"" problems with the site, which launched October 1. But it was a parenthetical comment that turned heads. ""We were anxious to get the website up and running and functional, which we clearly have failed to do to date,"" Sebelius said. ""Although, I would suggest the website has never crashed. It is functional but at a very slow speed and very low reliability."" Hasn't crashed, really? Critics of the site's failures -- as well as of the Affordable Care Act itself -- immediately pounced on her statement. One congresswoman pulled up the Obamacare site on an overhead projector during the hearing, appearing to show that it wasn't accessible at the time. (In fairness, it's not clear whether that problem was due to the site itself or a problem with host Verizon's servers that cropped up in the past few days. For what it's worth, it was opening for us just fine Wednesday afternoon). So, while Sebelius owned up to the errors that have plagued the site for the millions trying to use it, she seemed to be suggesting that, since the entire thing has never ground to a complete halt, it hasn't ""crashed."" Tech community, how does that sound? ""The site was crashing,"" said David Kennedy of online security firm TrustedSec. ""A crash is defined in the basic sense as an application not behaving as anticipated or not being able to handle something due to programming flaws,"" Kennedy added. ""The system doesn't work or stops serving because of the issues,"" he said. ""Basically, exactly what happened to the HealthCare.gov website."" The definition at Internet-centric encyclopedia Webopedia is similarly broad. It defines a crash as ""a serious computer failure."" ""A computer crash means that the computer itself stops working or that a program aborts unexpectedly,"" the definition continues. Kennedy said that what's been happening with the health care website is different from slowness caused by heavy traffic, which is not uncommon when sites debut to higher-than-expected popularity. Instead, Kennedy said, the site is delivering error messages and not letting people register, suggesting flaws in its coding. Technicalities aside, the wags of the Internet were having fun with Sebelius' comment. ""Depends what the meaning of 'crash' is,"" wrote conservative blogger Keith Koffler. ""Like, was it driving a car and it didn't crash into anything, so the website made it home from soccer practice? Or, does the website only go to parties to which it has been invited?"" Twitter, of course, chimed in. ""The Hindenburg didn't crash,"" wrote @ClarenceWhorley. ""It was just flying on the ground while on fire."" Michael Hayes, a reporter for BuzzFeed, wrote than Sebelius should do an AMA, the popular question-and-answer sessions on Reddit. ""That,"" replied Business Insider editor Paul Szoldra, ""would crash Reddit.""","Health secretary says Obamacare site ""has never crashed""
Kathleen Sebelius apologized for ""miserably frustrating"" problems .

"BRUSSELS, Belgium (CNN) -- Members of the European Union decided Thursday to formally lift sanctions on Cuba, a spokeswoman for EU Secretary-General Javier Solana said. Christina Gallach said the decision, made over dinner during the first day of a planned two-day summit in Brussels, Belgium, will be formally confirmed Monday during an EU council meeting. The diplomatic sanctions, which limited visits to the Communist island by senior EU personnel, were imposed in 2003 after concerns were raised about human rights in Cuba. The sanctions were suspended in 2005, so lifting them now could be considered a symbolic move. Plans call for the human rights situation to be reviewed next year. The move was seen as an attempt to encourage Cuban President Raúl Castro, who recently took the reins of power from his ailing brother, Fidel, to make progress on civil rights, officials said. At least one EU nation, Sweden, had wanted to see more evidence of progress before taking the step but agreed to go along with the move. The United States' trade blockade on Cuba, imposed almost 50 years ago, is not affected by the decision, but National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe expressed disappointment over the move. ""We think the Castros need to take a number of steps to improve the human rights conditions for ordinary Cubans before any sanctions are lifted,"" he said. State Department Deputy Spokesman Tom Casey said earlier Thursday that the United States did not support such a move by the European Union and sees no reason to shift policy. ""While we've seen some very minor cosmetic changes made by this regime, we certainly don't see any kind of fundamental break with the Castro dictatorship that would give us reason to believe that now would be the time to lift sanctions or otherwise fundamentally alter our policies,"" Casey told reporters prior to the EU's decision. ""So certainly, we would not be supportive of the EU or anyone else easing those restrictions at this time.""","The decision was made over dinner during the first day of a summit in Belgium .

"(CNN) -- Crimea's parliament has voted to secede from Ukraine and join Russia, and has scheduled a referendum for its residents to decide whether to stay or go. It is one of the biggest developments in the fast-moving crisis in Ukraine. Who is voting? The voters deciding Crimea's future would be the residents of that region. Crimea has a population of about 2 million. Crimea is known as a pro-Russian area, but it is not without its diversity. The autonomous region has a 60% ethnic Russian population, having been part of Russia until it was ceded to Ukraine in 1954 by the Soviet Union. But not everyone may be as keen on coming under Moscow's direct influence. A quarter of the peninsula's population is Ukrainian and about 12% Crimean Tatars, a predominantly Muslim group. The Tatars have shown no interest in breaking away. How much credibility will the vote have? The legality of the referendum has been challenged from the outset. While the Crimean parliament voted to hold the referendum, at the federal level, Ukrainian leaders say a referendum is illegal. It's an ""illegitimate decision,"" interim Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said Thursday. ""Crimea was, is, and will be an integral part of Ukraine."" Justice Minister Pavlo Petrenko said the Crimean parliament's decision is illegal because under the constitution, only national referendums are permitted. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe has sent a military observer mission to Ukraine, but it can only expand its mission to monitor the vote if the Ukrainian government invites it to. In Crimea, worlds collide . What's next if the referendum passes? See above. Even if the vote goes as planned, its legitimacy will continue to be questioned. Michael Crawford, a former British ambassador in Eastern Europe, cautioned that whatever the result of the vote, it may be meaningless. ""It does not follow that if Crimea votes to join Russia, that anyone will accept it,"" he said. ""For Russia to start cherry-picking bits of the former Soviet Union, cranking up referenda in Kazakhstan or Latvia or wherever you like, to try to carve off bits, would be against international law, and it would be something (that Russian President) Vladimir Putin has said he doesn't want to do."" In short, it is not clear how easily Crimea could secede from Ukraine and join Russia. Who would benefit from Crimea's secession? It is not clear. At first glance, it may appear that many Crimeans would get what they want and Russia would gain a territory, but the benefits are not so clear-cut. ""While separatism may seem emotionally gratifying to some (Crimean) residents, the practical results seen elsewhere, especially in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, have been economic isolation and a heightened dependence on Russia,"" Michael Hikari Cecire, an expert on the region, wrote recently. South Ossetia and Abkhazia are two separatist regions of Georgia that Russia occupied in 2008. For Russia, peeling off a slice of territory from Ukraine isn't productive, Cecire wrote. Its goal is to get all of Ukraine under its influence. Taking steps toward separatism has only deepened the crisis, as Russian intervention has galvanized anti-Russian sentiment in other parts of Ukraine. The referendum, scheduled for March 16, will probably just add fuel to the fire. Five possible directions in Ukraine .","Crimea is 60% Russian .
The Crimean referendum may be illegitimate, experts say .
It's unclear what will happen if the referendum passes ."
"(CNN) -- Barcelona's faltering defense of the La Liga title plumbed a fresh low Saturday with a 1-0 defeat at relegation strugglers Valladolid -- the third in the last seven league games. No matter that Barca enjoyed 80 per cent of the possession, the only statistic that mattered was a 17th minute strike from Italian Fausto Rossi. Arch-rivals Real Madrid can move four points clear of Barca with a home victory over Levante Sunday. But it was Real's city neighbors Atletico who topped the standings Saturday night as a 2-0 win over Celta Vigo saw them leapfrog both the 'big two' in Spain. David Villa scored twice to help them draw level with Real on 64 points, with a better head to head record, but having played a game more. Barcelona will be ruing the missed opportunity to keep the pressure on leaders Real, despite boss Gerardo Martino fielding a strong team after the international break. Lionel Messi was kept off the score sheet by excellent saves from home keeper Diego Marino and he was forced into action by the Argentina ace before the only goal of the match. Rossi fired home from close range past Victor Valdes after indecision in the Barcelona defense. Messi had to more efforts saved by halftime but after the break it was Neymar who missed Barca's best chance, blazing over from close range after being set up by Cesc Fabregas. The home side held out comfortably enough and might have added to their tally when Oscar spurned a fine chance. But they were left to celebrate a famous victory to move out of the relegation zone. ""We lacked ideas, movement and penetration, but I didn't in any way see a lack of attitude,"" Martino told AFP after the defeat. His side will have to regroup ahead of the visit of Manchester City Wednesday in the Champions League, but lead 2-0 from the first leg in the last 16 tie. The Catalan giants suffered a stinging 6-0 aggregate defeat to eventual winners Bayern Munich in the semifinals of last year's competition but had been in impeccable form under Martino until recent domestic setbacks. Meanwhile free-scoring Bayern have continued their all-conquering form, thrashing fifth-placed Wolfsburg 6-1 in the Bundesliga Saturday, despite the match being tied 1-1 at halftime. Bayern even trailed to a goal from Wolfsburg defender Naldo before Xherdan Shaqiri equalized by the break. Five goals in just 17 minutes continued the incredible scoring feats of the Bavarian giants with Thomas Muller and Mario Mandzukic each getting a double. Franck Ribery added the other for the defending German champions, who stretched their unbeaten league run to a record 49 matches. In 24 league matches, Pep Guardiola's team have registered an impressive 72 goals to leave them 23 points clear of nearest rivals Borussia Dortmund, who play Sunday. In France's Ligue 1, Paris Saint Germain took another big step towards retaining the title with a 3-0 win at Bastia. Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored the opener and set up Ezequiel Lavezzi for the other two goals, the first assist from a impudent back-flick. The win left PSG eight points clear of title rivals Monaco, who beat Sochaux 2-1 in a later game.","Barcelona beaten 1-0 at Valladolid .

"(CNN) -- In the tech world, paying a celebrity to love your product can sometimes backfire. On Wednesday, NBA superstar LeBron James took to Twitter to announce a nightmare of the mobile age: ""My phone just erased everything I had in it and rebooted. One of the sickest feelings I've ever had in my life!!!"" Here's the problem: That phone was, presumably, the Samsung Galaxy Note that the Miami Heat star is paid big money to endorse. His was just the most recent in a series of public missteps by celebrities who have been increasingly called upon to create buzz for tech products. James quickly deleted the tweet and soon thereafter -- presumably with some help from his friends at the Korean gadget company -- posted this: ""Close call. Wheew! Got all my info back. Gamer! Lol."" It's not the first time a celebrity, an endorsement deal and Twitter have merged to create an awkward gaffe. Just this month, Oscars host Ellen DeGeneres took the Selfie Seen Round the World with a smartphone from Samsung, a major sponsor of the awards. But, backstage, she was caught tweeting Oscars thoughts from her iPhone. Singer Alicia Keys claimed she was hacked last year (the Anthony Weiner Defense?) when she apparently sent a tweet from an iPhone just days after she was named a ""creative director"" for BlackBerry. And in 2012, Oprah Winfrey (or one of her staff) raved about the new Microsoft Surface tablet -- in a tweet using Twitter for iPad. Sometimes, competing loyalties collide when gadget endorsements are involved. In March 2013, ""The Big Bang Theory"" star Kaley Cuoco tweeted some (sponsored) praise for Dish Network's Hopper, a DVR system. Turns out, CBS, which airs ""Big Bang,"" was locked in a lawsuit with Dish and other DVR makers over the systems' ability to skip ads. She did the obligatory tweet delete. Dish accused CBS of making her. CBS denied it. And the beat goes on. Martin Lindstrom, a brand adviser to Fortune 500 companies and author of ""Buyology: Truth and Lies About Why We Buy,"" said such flubs are ""a major risk"" companies run when they sign up celebrity endorsers. But don't expect the practice to go away anytime soon. Lindstrom also said that, even in these faux-pas cases, the endorsements pay off. ""We learned that the positive effect seems surprisingly stronger than the negative effect,"" he said, citing research conducted for one of his books. ""In reality, this means that the Oscar viewers are much more likely to remember Ellen's Samsung endorsement, including the Samsung name, and (are) hardly judging on the brand if a celebrity messes around with the situation."" And while celebrity tweets make the headlines, Lindstrom said, the prevalence of social media now means they're not the only ones we look to to decide what we think about a product. ""The concept of conventional celebrity endorsement has expanded from just engaging the superstars to everyone from the 10-minutes-of-fame person to even people who have carved out some niche audience on a very focused topic,"" he said. ""We've all more or less turned into personal brands -- and thus we're all more or less likely to witness ourselves in a brand endorsement role in the future.""","LeBron James tweeted a complaint about the smartphone he endorses .

"JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (CNN) -- What do you say when you meet one of the most iconic statesmen in the world? Mandela holds baby Freya as Robyn Curnow and her husband Kim look on. For someone who makes a living out of communications, I have consistently been tongue-tied around Nelson Mandela. The funny thing is I am not particularly star-struck -- as a CNN correspondent I get to interview and profile all sorts of ""famous"" people. It's just a not a big deal for me. However, with Madiba (as Mandela is often called), I feel like every moment spent with him is a gift, a blessing that I will tell my grandchildren about one day. As a South African he has a place in our hearts that is hard to define. However, my stories about my encounters with Nelson Mandela are the stuff of comedy clubs. I've never quite managed to hold my own with him. I always land up somehow embarrassing myself when I am around him; I've slipped on shiny presidential floors, got tangled up in camera equipment and made pathetically inane comments. I first met Nelson Mandela in the early 1990s. I can't remember exactly when, but it was at the Wanderers cricket stadium in Johannesburg. He visited the VIP room, during a test match, where I was working during school vacations and everybody lined up to meet him. I stood proudly and waited my turn, he came over to me. He was tall. He said to me, ""You are so gracious, I am so humbled to meet you."" I remember thinking, if Nelson Mandela thinks I am gracious -- fantastic. I promptly turned around and ungraciously tripped on my best shoes, tumbling into the crowd behind me. I was the one humbled. Years later, I was a young reporter working for the South African Broadcasting Corporation during Mandela's presidency. I wasn't senior enough to cover the big political stories of the day so news editors only assigned me the light hearted Mandela news stories. The one I remember most was around a birthday or Christmas during which there was a photo opportunity at one of his grandson's kindergartens. Word had got out among the press that ""Twinkle twinkle little star"" was Madiba's favorite nursery rhyme, so, of course, all the children sang it for him. I sang along too, twinkle-finger actions included, it's a great song. Whether it was or not Madiba's favorite, is not something I have ever asked him. Years after that, I was taking a sabbatical from journalism and spent a year studying for my Masters degree at Cambridge University. Mandela just happened to be an honorary fellow at Magdalene College, where I was studying. He came to visit that year, giving a speech in the college's beautiful cloisters. I waved at him, as he passed by all of us students assembled in the quadrangle. Of course, he didn't wave back, but I felt gracious and humbled in his presence, protected by Magdalene's great walls. And then I turned to my awe-struck friends and said, ""Did you know his favorite song is 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star?'"" -- which kind of killed the moment. Fast forward a few more years, I reported on Mandela occasionally during my time as a correspondent at CNN London's bureau. From a distance, I saw him get older and shakier on his feet. His hair got whiter and his public engagements lessened considerably. Once in while, I would regale my friends with Madiba's stories -- yes, there are more -- like the time I sneaked into the bathroom in his presidential mansion, desperate for relief, before a long-delayed press conference and phoned a friend from within to ask whether it was morally right to steal some of Nelson Mandela's soap. ( I didn't. It isn't very gracious). Or the time, I asked Zelda la Grange, his devoted personal assistant, to take a photo of me and Madiba together before I went up to Cambridge. He agreed and came over to me, throwing his arm around me and giving me squeeze a and joking, ""Ah, I am sure your boyfriend will be jealous."" Did you know that Nelson Mandela is a terrible flirt? Again, I became self-conscious. I was carrying my handbag over my shoulder and I didn't want the photo to look like I was Margaret Thatcher or my grandmother, for that matter, constantly clutching a handbag. So with his arm still firm around my middle, I bent down to put my handbag on the floor. That's when Zelda took the photo... unfortunately; the automatic flash went off on my camera. That's a complete no-no around Mandela -- his eyes were damaged during his years of imprisonment on Robben Island and flash photography is forbidden. So they whizzed away, slightly peeved, and I landed up with a ""Me and Mandela"" photograph that showed the president grinning into camera, holding me around the waist and me half bent over, lowering my handbag, with my head half cocked and eyes half closed. It was not mantelpiece material. I never thought I'd meet him again, up close and personal, until, last year when Zelda, ever the diplomat, like her boss, invited to me to introduce my newly born daughter, Freya, to him. My husband Kim and I had just returned back to live in South Africa, after nearly six years away in London. It was oddly nerve-racking, and I did what I always do in his presence I acted incredibly gauche, stupid and clumsy. I kept on saying: ""So how are you?"" As if he'd offer me a glass of wine, and say, ""Ya know Robyn, my knees are killing me, I'm bit worried about the situation in Zimbabwe and howz about them Mets?"" I offered my baby to him, like a little sacrificial lamb. The pictures tell it all. The ones we sent to friends (and everybody we knew), show us laughing with the world's greatest statesman. The ones we didn't email to the world show our daughter freaking out and crying. Madiba tried to placate her by wagging a finger at her and telling her, ""I am your great great grandfather."" She freaked out some more. I think she takes after her mother.","Curnow first met Mandela in 1990 and has encountered him several times .

"(CNN) -- Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has become the third-straight Pentagon chief to decide against recommending a Medal of Honor for a Marine who died fighting in Iraq. Circumstances surrounding Sgt. Rafael Peralta's final moments in Fallujah in 2004 have been controversial for years. Supporters of the Peralta family and some in Congress led by Rep. Duncan Hunter, a California Republican, have advocated for the award posthumously. They believe Peralta, severely wounded by gunfire, pulled a grenade under his body and shielded other Marines from the blast. They contend he gave his life to save others, an essential element of the Medal of Honorâ€”the nation's highest battlefield award. But Hagel has joined his two immediate predecessors, Leon Panetta and Robert Gates, in ruling that medical and battlefield evidence does not rise to the necessary level of certainty. ""Secretary Hagel determined the totality of the evidence does not meet the proof beyond a reasonable doubt Medal of Honor standard,"" a Pentagon statement said, noting that he would not reopen the award nomination for Peralta. ""Three separate secretaries of defense have now examined the case, and each independently concluded the evidence does not support award of the Medal of Honor,"" the statement said. In previous reviews, some medical evidence indicated Peralta's head wounds were so severe that he would have been killed instantly, ruling out any conscious effort to smother the grenade. Peralta, 25, of San Diego, has been posthumously awarded the Navy Cross, the second-highest award.","Sgt. Rafael Peralta died in 2004 while fighting in Iraq .

"(CNN) -- On Friday, Madonna posted a photo to her Instagram account of her teenage son, Rocco, throwing a punch in a boxing ring with the caption: ""Nobody messes with Dirty Soap! Mama said knock you out!"" she wrote below the picture, adding the hashtag ""#disniâ€”a."" Yes, of course. When the inevitable public outcry began of her use of the n-word, the photo was deleted and reposted, its caption replaced with, in true Madonna fashion, ""#get off my dâ€”k haters!"" None of this furor is accidental. The pop icon is no stranger to controversy, but now it may be time to examine the consequences of her latest cultural tourism in the name of reinvention. In each of her many visual incarnations and cultural flings, Madonna has been predictably parasitic. She shamelessly moves on to the next character, having usurped all the cool or controversial parts of the previous one. Now, there is her use of the n-word. This lack of concern for the impact of her words is especially troubling because of her rainbow coalition of children, adopted and biological. But this is Madonna we're talking about. As rumors of a possible performance with BeyoncÃ© at the Grammys next month swirl, it make sense that she's crept back into the news. This is the woman who embraced her title as the Queen of Obscene decades ago. This is the woman who bared all for her widely banned coffee table book ""Sex,"" released alongside the ""Erotica"" album in 1992. She has performed hanging from a cross, criticized the Iraq War and masturbated both on stage and in movies. Lady Gaga may live for the applause, but Madge no doubt lives for the uproar. She is as adept at generating headlines as she is at churning out chart-topping albums. And she's more likely to respond with a middle finger than a heartfelt apology. She stands firm in her decisions and historically doesn't back down from her statements. I previously valued that very quality in her. Madonna: 'N-word' hashtag was 'term of endearment' to son . As a dancer and former aspiring choreographer, I appreciate the bold spectacle in Madonna's live shows. Her wildly successful Confessions Tour, for example, demonstrated the penchant for pushing creative boundaries that has kept me on board even when critics abandoned her. But even that fandom comes with reservations. It's expected that influences change as musical trends and interests shift. But Madonna? She has put in overtime to earn her status as cultural tourist-in-chief, cherry-picking the most catchy, marketable aspects of her current host culture for commercial benefit with little regard for integrity or respect of the reception to her behavior. When she offended Hindus by wearing a bindi, which is symbolic of chastity and purity, while wearing a see-through top at a VMA performance, a spokesperson told MTV that Madonna did not ""understand why [they] are upset."" She defended her use of Nazi imagery during her MDNA Tour as being used to highlight ""the intolerance humans have for one another."" Madonna has repeatedly demonstrated that she views cultural iconography, from dance styles to religious symbols, as artistic statements and sets them aside when no longer convenient. In her early days, she mimicked Marilyn Monroe. Then came her Spanish fixation in the late 1980s with ""La Isla Bonita."" In 1990, she introduced voguing to the world, a dance style made popular by gay black and Latino creators. Then came bindis, saris, funky henna tattoos and ambiguous prayer-chanting magic on her ""Ray of Light"" album. She was a butt-kicking female Che Guevera type on the artwork of ""American Life."" Each image immaculately styled, each revamp merely enduring the life cycle of her current fascination. Using the n-word on Instagram is just Madge being Madge. And her ""I'm sorry if you were offended""-style nonapology doesn't indicate that she's learned anything from the backlash. Would she defiantly brush off the same ""term of endearment"" were it directed to her black children adopted from Malawi, David Banda and Mercy James? Has she become overly comfortable, having black friends, peers and black children? This incident is less about Madonna being a racist and more about her continued lack of tact. This would make a great teachable moment for her children about mistakes and consequences, in her latest reinvention as a humanitarian and mother. But it should first be a lesson for Madonna herself. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Alexander Hardy.","Madonna's recent controversy should not be a surprise, the author says .
Hardy: This is the latest in a career that borrows from what is ""cool"" in culture .
Now, as a mother, perhaps she should consider the impact on her children ."
"Vancouver, British Columbia (CNN) -- Charmian Gooch, the anti-corruption crusader who co-founded Global Witness, called Tuesday night for action to lift the veil on who owns corporations around the world. She made that wish as she accepted the $1 million TED Prize at the TED2014 conference. ""My wish is for us to know who owns and controls companies so that they can no longer be used anonymously against the public good. Let's ignite world opinion, change the law, and together launch a new era of openness in business."" Her call to expose criminals and corrupt officials came at the end of the first full day of TED's 30th anniversary conference. Earlier, another speaker on transparency, Edward Snowden, argued his case that NSA surveillance programs infringe privacy for no real benefit. In her TED Prize wish, Gooch made the case that the identity of corporate owners shouldn't be kept private. She said the development of a public registry of corporate ownership would enable the exposure of tax evasion, terrorism, drug trafficking, conflict minerals, sanctions busting and political corruption. ""This truly is a scandal of epic proportions hidden in plain sight,"" Gooch said. In states such as Delaware, she said, it's easier to set up a company than to get a library card, and in 10 minutes of online shopping you can have a corporation to shield your identity. As examples of the need to ferret out the true ownership of companies, she cited the investigation of the assets owned by the ousted regime of Viktor Yanukovych in Ukraine and said the impoverished people of the Democratic Republic of Congo had been cheated of a billion dollars by anonymous companies. Gooch and her two Global Witness co-founders have also received the $1 million Skoll Award for Social Entrepreneurship. Global Witness was founded 20 years ago and gained fame in part from its reporting on how the diamond trade was fueling conflict in Africa. She says the UK government and the European Parliament are ""on board"" in support of the public registry, and that her group is working to get support from the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama. ""America is the next big target,"" Gooch said. ""It has to come on board."" She said the United States and United Kingdom account for a majority of the cases in which shielded corporate ownership is used to hide crime. Two U.S. senators, Democrat Carl Levin of Michigan and Republican Chuck Grassley of Iowa have introduced a bill that would require states to ask people seeking to set up corporations to disclose their true owners. ""Today, money launderers, arms dealers, drug lords, terrorists and tax evaders are too often able to conceal their misconduct behind a wall of corporate secrecy,"" Levin said in a statement. The topics of secrecy and privacy came up in a different context when Snowden told the TED2014 conference from an undisclosed location in Russia on Tuesday that ""we don't have to give up our liberty to have security."" Appearing on a small screen mounted on a rolling, swiveling robot that looked a bit like an upright vacuum cleaner, the former National Security Agency contractor said, ""I am proof that you can go up against the most powerful intelligence agencies in the world and win."" Snowden said he doesn't think of himself as a hero, but TED curator Chris Anderson asked the audience of 1,200 whether he had performed a heroic act, and many agreed. Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, was asked to come on stage and also said he would classify Snowden as a hero. A minority of those in the audience raised their hands to say they considered Snowden's release of classified government information a ""reckless"" act. Snowden endorsed Berners-Lee's argument that this year's 25th anniversary of the Web should be the occasion for a new ""magna carta"" establishing the right to online freedom. He said people deserve a right to privacy when they order a book online, call their families or travel and shouldn't be subject to how the government will interpret their acts later. Snowden argued that surveillance hasn't prevented terrorist acts and that the fight against terrorism is a cover for intrusive government agencies. The most important thing private companies can do to protect consumers is to encrypt their data, Snowden said. He said the action of someone ordering a copy of the book ""1984"" on Amazon can be discovered by intelligence agencies because the data is not encrypted. Asked about criticism by former Vice President Dick Cheney that he has done enormous damage to America's national security, Snowden said that ""going to war with people who are not our enemies, in places that aren't threats, doesn't make us safe."" Snowden, who has worked with journalists to reveal the secrets he obtained from his work with the NSA, said there will be more revelations. ""Some of the most important reporting to be done is yet to come,"" he said.","Charmian Gooch, co-founder of Global Witness, awarded $1 million TED Prize .

"TBLISI, Georgia (CNN) -- Russian forces launched an airstrike against a military airfield near the Tbilisi International Airport early Sunday, despite international calls for Russia to stand down from the escalating conflict, Georgian officials told CNN. The attack near the Georgian capital city came after a day of intense fighting in the former Soviet republic, with dozens of Russian warplanes bombing civilian and military targets in Georgia on Saturday. As many as 2,000 people had been killed in the capital of separatist Georgian province South Ossetia, according to a Russian ambassador. ""The city of Tskhinvali no longer exists. There is nothing left. It was wiped out by the Georgian military,"" the Russian news agency Interfax said, quoting the Russian ambassador to Georgia, Vyacheslav Kovalenko. Tskhinvali residents who survived the bombardment by hiding in basements and later fled the city estimated that hundreds of civilians had died. They said bodies were everywhere, according to The Associated Press. CNN could not independently confirm any death tolls, which varied greatly depending on the source. Alexander Lomaia, secretary of Georgia's National Security Council, said dozens of Georgian troops had lost their lives.  Watch Georgian minister describe fighting in South Ossetia » . ""Our losses are mounting ... as many as 40 military servicemen killed and over 100 wounded,"" he said. ""The losses are also mounting among civilian population in the cities."" Lomaia said Georgian troops in Tskhinvali were engaged in fierce ground battles on Saturday with Russian troops, whom he said were engaged in a full-scale military operation. The operation included tanks, armored vehicles, heavy artillery, soldiers and paratroopers, Lomaia said. Military aircraft were crossing the Georgian border about every 15 minutes, he said, hitting civilian, economic and military targets. He said that at least 50 military jets were being used.  Watch images of crashed Georgian war plane » . ""Frankly, we have not expected the Russian invaders to hit our residential buildings, to hit our peaceful cities, to hit our peaceful citizens,"" he said. He said he couldn't confirm whether Georgia's capital, Tbilisi, had been hit. ""From the legal point of view, our actions are absolutely justified and legitimate,"" Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said in Vladikavkaz, the capital of the Russian region of North Ossetia. ""Moreover, they are necessary."" He arrived in the region that borders South Ossetia on Saturday night. Putin's press secretary told Interfax that the premier was concerned about the flood of refugees arriving in Russia from South Ossetia. Russian officials said that more than 30,000 refugees have left South Ossetia and crossed into Russia over the past two days, Interfax reported. ""The actions of the Georgian authorities in South Ossetia are a crime, of course, primarily a crime against their own people,"" Putin said. ""This aggression led to numerous casualties, among civilians in particular, and virtually caused a real humanitarian catastrophe. And that is already a crime against the Ossetian people,"" he said. ""At the same time I would like to stress that Georgia has always been greatly respected in Russia and Georgians regarded as brotherly people,"" the premier said. Russians struck several major targets Saturday, including the Black Sea port of Poti, an airport, a major pipeline and a military base and train station in Senaki in western Georgia, Lomaia said. Georgian officials said that a center housing civilians had also been hit. Eight Georgians died in the port town, Georgian officials said. The Kodori Gorge in upper Abkhazia -- a second breakaway province in Georgia -- was also bombarded by at least 12 Russian jets, Lomaia said. Georgia's public television station reported a second round of bombings in Abkhazia at just before 11:30 p.m. Military bases at Vaziani and Marneuli also came under attack, the British Foreign Office said, and Russian aircraft bombed the Georgian town of Gori, about 35 miles northwest of Tbilisi, Georgian officials said. An Associated Press reporter who visited Gori shortly after the Russian airstrikes Saturday saw several apartment buildings in ruins, some still on fire, and scores of dead bodies and bloodied civilians. The elderly, women and children were among the victims. A Russian naval fleet was anchored in the Black Sea port of Ochamchire in Abkhazia province, Lomaia added. ""We have managed to down 10 Russian jets, and one of the pilots has been captured alive and is being treated in a military hospital,"" Lomaia said. ""We have also destroyed up to 30 Russian tanks and heavy military [vehicles]."" The situation in South Ossetia escalated rapidly from Thursday night, when Georgia said it had launched an operation into the region after its unilateral cease-fire was met with artillery fire from separatists that killed 10 people, including peacekeepers and civilians. It accused Russia of backing the separatists. Russian tanks began rolling into Georgia on Thursday night. On Saturday, the Georgian parliament approved President Mikhail Saakashvili's request to impose a ""state of war"" for 15 days, officials said. The order is not a formal declaration of war and stops short of declaring martial law, according to Georgian officials. It gives Saakashvili powers he would not ordinarily have, such as issuing curfews, restricting the movement of people or limiting commercial activities, those officials said. Saakashvili asked Western leaders to pressure Russia to agree to an immediate cease-fire. ""We are dealing with absolutely criminal and crazy acts of irresponsible and reckless decision makers, which is on the ground producing dramatic and tragic consequences,"" Saakashvili said Saturday afternoon. U.S. President Bush, speaking from Beijing, China, called for an immediate halt to the violence, a stand-down by all troops and an end to the Russian bombings. He urged the sides to return to ""the status quo of August the 6th.""  Watch Bush express concerns over situation » . ""The attacks are occurring in regions of Georgia far from the zone of conflict in South Ossetia. They mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis,"" Bush said in a statement while attending the Olympic Games, according to The Associated Press. Bush spoke Saturday evening to Saakashvili and Russian President Medvedev, a White House spokesman said. The war, Saakashvili said, ""is not about South Ossetia. It has never been in the first place. It is about destroying a small democratic nation aspiring to live in peace, freedom and liberty."" ""This unprovoked, long-time-ago-planned invasion and aggression must stop,"" he said. It was unclear which side controlled Tskhinvali on Saturday. The Georgians said fighting raged, but the Russians said they had ""liberated"" the city. ""Battalion task forces have fully liberated Tskhinvali of Georgian armed forces and started pushing Georgian units out of the area of responsibility of the peacekeeping forces,"" General Vladimir Boldyrev, commander of the Russian Ground Forces, told Interfax. Colonel-General Anatoly Nogovitsyn, a spokesman for the Russian Defense Ministry, said that Georgians had shot down two Russian aircraft, contradicting Georgian claims. Georgia, a pro-Western ally of the United States, is intent on asserting its authority over South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Both have strong Russian-backed separatist movements. Inside South Ossetia, civilians have been without water, electricity and basic services for more than a day, said Maia Kardava, a Red Cross spokeswoman in Tbilisi. She said the Red Cross was unable to reach colleagues based in Tskhinvali because their phones had lost power and they were huddled in bomb shelters.

"(CNN) -- It was conceived in secret in the 1980s but it's difficult to miss the Airbus A380 these days. The giant aircraft is a true leviathan of the sky and has just marked its fifth year of commercial service. In October 2007 Singapore Airlines became the first airline to fly the A380, the world's longest commercial airliner at the time. That title is now claimed by the Boeing 747-8 Intercontinental, but the A380 is still wider and carries more passengers. Read more: Boeing 747-8 vs. Airbus A380 . Since first taking to the skies to great fanfare, 89 A380s have come into service around the world, with Thai Airways recently becoming the ninth airline to operate the ""Superjumbo."" In total, 257 orders for new A380s are booked in, with Airbus aiming to ramp up production to as many as three aircraft per month in the coming years. Cultivating this demand is essential if the plane is to be profitable. The A380 initially arrived three years overdue and billions of dollars over budget. Other setbacks during its first five years of service -- including cracks in the wing components discovered in January this year -- have also slowed production as checks and repairs were made on the worldwide fleet. See also: What will Airbus A380 fault mean for airlines? Despite these challenges, Airbus says it expects to break even on the A380 by 2015. Key to this expansion is securing large orders in emerging markets such as Brazil, China and Mexico, the company says.

"(CNN) -- In a crackdown on football match-fixing, Singaporean authorities have arrested more than a dozen people they suspect of being members of an organized crime syndicate. The arrests come amid a global effort to uncover corruption in the sport, which European police officials believe has reached some of the world's most high-profile games including World Cup qualifiers and UEFA Champions League matches. Among the 14 people detained in Singapore during the 12-hour operation on Tuesday is the crime group's suspected leader, the Singapore Police Force and the city-state's Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau said in a joint statement late Wednesday. The statement didn't disclose the names of the arrested suspects, and authorities wouldn't say whether Tan Seet Eng, a Singaporean man also known as Dan Tan, was among them. Singapore police said earlier this year that Tan, considered to be a key suspect in the global match-fixing scheme, was helping them with their investigations. Europol, the European Union's law enforcement agency, said in February that it was investigating hundreds of games on suspicion of match-fixing. It pointed to ""a suspected organized crime syndicate"" in Singapore as masterminding the alleged scams and working with criminal networks in Europe. Singaporean authorities said some of the people they detained this week, including the suspected leader, are ""the subject of ongoing investigations in other jurisdictions for match fixing activities."" Australian soccer hit by 'disturbing' match-fixing scandal . 'An important step' Interpol, the international police organization, said it had helped to connect investigators in Singapore and Europe. ""Singaporean authorities have taken an important step in cracking down on an international match-fixing syndicate by arresting the main suspects in the case, including the suspected mastermind,"" said Ronald K. Noble, Interpol's secretary general. ""No person should doubt Singapore's commitment to fighting match-fixing."" The suspected leader and four others are being held for further investigation, the Singaporean agencies said. The nine remaining suspects will be released on bail, they added. The people arrested -- 12 men and two women -- are all Singaporean and are aged between 38 and 60, Singapore authorities said. ""Singapore is committed to eradicate match-fixing as a transnational crime and protect the integrity of the sport,"" the police and the corruption investigation bureau said. ""All cases will be pursued vigorously with a view to bring perpetrators to justice."" European police officials in February described their investigation as ""the biggest-ever investigation into suspected match-fixing in Europe.""

"(CNN) -- Everyone is familiar with Tyrannosaurus rex, but humanity is only now meeting its much smaller Arctic cousin. Scientists have announced the discovery of a new genus and species of dinosaur, based on remains found in Alaska. They are calling the species Nanuqsaurus hoglundi. This dinosaur lived about 70 million years ago, say paleontologists Anthony Fiorillo and Ronald Tykoski, at the Perot Museum of Nature and Science in Dallas. Their study, published in the journal PLOS One, is aptly called ""A Diminutive New Tyrannosaur from the Top of the World."" Researchers discovered the dinosaur's remains in 2006 in the Prince Creek Formation on Alaska's North Slope. At the same quarry, Fiorillo and Tykoski have previously uncovered other important finds, such as remnants of the horned dinosaur species Pachyrhinosaurs perotorum, whose discovery was announced in 2011. ""I find it absolutely thrilling that there is another new dinosaur found in the polar region,"" Fiorillo said in a statement from the Perot Museum. ""It tells us that the ecosystem of ancient Arctic was a very different place, and it challenges everything we know about dinosaurs."" What scientists know about Nanuqsaurus hoglundi comes from just a few fragments: The top part of a skull section, part of a lower jaw, and part of an upper facial jawbone. ""Nanuqsaurus"" loosely translates to ""polar bear lizard,"" according to the Perot Museum, and honors the Inupiat people whose territory traditionally includes where the dinosaur remnants were found. The ""hoglundi"" part honors Dallas entrepreneur and philanthropist Forrest Hoglund. A Tyrannosaurus rex would have weighed between 7 and 8 tons, with a length of about 40 feet. By comparison, an adult Nanuqsaurus might have been only 25 feet long, with a weight of 1,000 pounds. The head was probably about 2 feet long, CNN affiliate WFAA reported. ""There were features in these specimens that were unique; you didn't see them in other tyrannosaurs,"" Tykoski told WFAA. Study authors told the Perot Museum that the dinosaur may have been so small because of how isolated the area was, and how little food was likely available. At that time, planet Earth as a whole was warmer than it is today, but this particular area in Alaska would have been dark about half the year. ""Conditions in this setting were relatively warm, but there were profound to extreme seasonal changes in light regime throughout the year that would have limited resource availability and produced substantial variance in temperatures,"" study authors wrote. We know of other animals have clearly adapted to their environments by evolving in size over time, such as large Russian Arctic mammoths that evolved to be cow-sized. But why was this particular dinosaur, Nanuqsaurus hoglundi, living so far north on the globe? Scientists have many more such questions to explore. In terms of investigating this polar region for more clues, as Fiorillo put it, this is just the tip of the iceberg.

"London (CNN) -- Police investigating the disappearance of three-year-old Madeleine McCann from a holiday apartment in Portugal in 2007 say they are hunting a man who assaulted five other British girls in resorts on the Algarve between 2004 and 2006. The announcement is the latest development in a long-running and controversial hunt for the missing girl. When and where was Madeleine last seen? Madeleine McCann was a few days shy of her fourth birthday when she vanished from her family's holiday apartment in the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz on May 3, 2007. Her parents, Kate and Gerry, had left Madeleine and her younger twin siblings, Sean and Amelie, asleep while they went for dinner with friends at a tapas restaurant nearby. Kate McCann raised the alarm at about 10pm that evening when she returned to check on the children and discovered that Madeleine was missing; the window of the children's room was open. What happened next? The case sparked worldwide interest, boosted by a massive publicity campaign launched by the McCanns, who are doctors from Leicestershire in central England. A large reward was offered for information on Madeleine's whereabouts, including contributions from ""Harry Potter"" author J.K. Rowling, pop mogul Simon Cowell, and businessman Richard Branson. Appeals for help to trace the missing girl were issued by footballers including David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo. The McCanns traveled widely to publicize the search for their daughter. The couple, who are Roman Catholics, also met the then-Pope Benedict XVI in Rome to ask him to pray for Madeleine's safe return. Who were the early suspects in the case? Portuguese police named Robert Murat, a British man living in Portugal, as an ""arguido"", or official suspect, some 10 days into the investigation; Murat denied the allegations and insisted he was innocent. The case against him was later dropped, and he received an apology and damages from several UK newspapers after reaching an out-of-court settlement with them over libel claims. In September 2007, Kate and Gerry McCann were themselves named as suspects by Portuguese investigators, amid reports DNA had been found in a car they rented weeks after Madeleine vanished. They strenuously denied the allegations, and Portuguese police closed the case against them in July 2008. The couple accepted $1.1m in libel damages, and secured front page apologies from UK newspapers the Daily Star and Daily Express over reports suggesting they were involved in their daughter's disappearance. In 2011, Kate McCann told the Leveson Inquiry into theconduct of the British press that she felt ""violated"" by media coverage of the case, in particular the publication of extracts from her diary in the now-defunct News of the World. Gerry McCann told Leveson that the paper's editor verbally beat the couple ""into submission"" to make them take part in an interview. What happened after the case was closed in 2008? Portuguese investigators turned their files over to the McCanns' private detectives, who continued to follow up potential leads and tip-offs, while the McCann family and their supporters pressed UK authorities to open an investigation of their own into the case. Kate and Gerry published a book, ""Madeleine,"" about their search for their daughter in May 2011. In the same month, London's Metropolitan Police began a review of Madeleine's disappearance. In October 2013, British police issued new police sketches of potential suspects in the case, along with new lines of inquiry linked to a series of burglaries in the resort where Madeleine went missing. An appeal on the BBC TV show ""Crimewatch"" led to more than 1,000 calls from the public; two callers named the same suspect. Police in Portugal later said they would reopen the case. Have there been any sightings of Madeleine? Sightings of Madeleine have been reported as far afield as Morocco, Holland, France, Belgium, Brazil and New Zealand, but all appear to have been false alarms. What do Madeleine's parents believe happened to her? Kate and Gerry McCann believe Madeleine was kidnapped, and that she is still alive somewhere. The couple regularly appeal for information on her whereabouts. In May 2009, two years after Madeleine vanished, Kate McCann told U.S. TV presenter Oprah Winfrey that she was keeping Madeleine's room ready for her, and that she visited it twice daily, ""just (to) say hello ... just (to) tell her we're still going ... to do everything we can to find her."" Madeleine would now be nine years old, and age-progressed images showing what she may look like have been released. What are the latest developments? On March 19, 2014, British police said they were hunting a man who assaulted five other young British girls on holiday in Portugal in the years leading up to and following Madeleine's disappearance. Officers are now investigating a dozen potentially linked crimes at resorts near where the three-year-old vanished. In each of the cases, a man described as tanned and with short, dark, unkempt hair, is suspected of breaking in to vacation homes where British families were staying in the Algarve. In four of the incidents, girls between 7 and 10 years of age were sexually assaulted in their beds. READ MORE: Timeline of the Madeleine McCann case .

"(CNN) -- The drug is finally in Josh Hardy's system, but his father says his ailing son is still looking at a very tough road. Josh's parents got what they'd been praying for this week: a chance to get medicine that could help their 7-year-old son survive. The Chimerix pharmaceutical company said Tuesday that Josh would receive medicine that doctors hope will help him. He got his first dose of the drug, brincidofovir, on Wednesday. The company had previously denied calls from the family to give him the drug, arguing that spending the time to help Josh and others like him would slow efforts to get the drug on the market. The boy's story drew national attention as his parents and supporters pushed the company to change its mind, through online and media campaigns. ""Josh has a long road to recovery,"" Todd Hardy, Josh's father, told CNN in an e-mail Thursday. He said his son has stopped getting worse -- that he was deteriorating last week and now he's not. Josh is expected to take the drug for at least 12 weeks. He still isn't taking any food or drink by mouth, and his 5-year-old brother, Jude, ""is purposely torturing him by drinking carton after carton of chocolate milk that's available in the ICU break room,"" Hardy said. Josh's journey began when he was diagnosed with a rare form of kidney cancer at 9 months old. Over the years, cancer turned up in his thymus, lung and bone marrow, and each time Josh beat it. But a bone marrow transplant left Josh without much of an immune system, and in February doctors diagnosed him with an adenovirus that spread through his body. Now he's in critical condition in a Memphis, Tennessee, intensive care unit as the virus ravages his body. Josh is in heart and kidney failure. A Facebook page dedicated to the online campaign to help Josh get the medicine posted a photograph of the boy, along with the message: ""Please pray that the drug is as effective in combating this virus as we hope.""

"(CNN) -- A convicted murderer who escaped from a Michigan prison on Super Bowl Sunday used snow-white thermal underwear, hobby scissors, his belt and a dose of inattention from prison guards to sneak out, the state Department of Corrections has concluded in a newly released report. Michael David Elliot ducked away from other prisoners after dinner on February 2, slipped outside and took off an extra-large set of prison blues to reveal a head-to-toe outfit of white clothing he'd crafted from thermal underwear, according to the prison report. He used the white clothing to blend in with the snow cover at Ionia Correctional Facility in central Michigan as he crawled toward a pair of wire fences separating him from freedom, the report found. He used a hook he had taken from his locker to dig through the snow, and used the scissors and his belt buckle to pry the wire fencing open and escape. Motion detectors that should have spotted his presence hadn't been properly reset after an earlier test, so they didn't work, the agency's report said. Elliot, who was serving four life sentences for a 1994 murder conviction, slipped into woods near the prison after his escape, eventually carjacking a woman who was parked on a city street. They drove to Elkhart, Indiana, where the woman called police after locking herself in a bathroom when they stopped for gas. Elliott told the woman that he didn't want to hurt her, he just wanted to get away from Michigan and prison. Authorities later found Elliot nearby in LaPorte County, Indiana, where he remains awaiting extradition, according to the Michigan corrections department.

"(CNN) -- A staff reporter for the Agence France-Presse news agency, his wife and two of his three children were among nine civilians killed in an attack on a hotel in the Afghan capital, the news agency said Friday. The incident began when four teenagers entered the Serena Hotel in central Kabul on Thursday and started shooting randomly, according to police. AFP said journalist Sardar Ahmad started working for the news agency in 2003 and went on to become its senior reporter in Kabul, ""covering all aspects of life, war and politics in his native country"" and specializing in security issues. He also founded the Kabul Pressistan private news agency, AFP said. The hotel was hosting special celebrations at the time of the attack to mark the eve of the Persian New Year, or Nowruz, AFP said. Nowruz is a major holiday in Afghanistan. Gen. Mohammad Ayoub Salangi, the deputy interior minister, said Thursday that those killed included Afghans and foreigners, children and adults. Six people were also injured. Afghan security forces killed the four gunmen, who police said were under 18 and were ""government opponents."" Police said they believe the gunmen entered the hotel by smuggling small pistols in their shoes and then hid in the bathroom for several hours before launching their attack. The hotel also was the site of a shooting, in January 2008, that killed seven people. The Taliban claimed responsibility for that attack. Thursday's attack was the latest to claim the lives of foreigners in the Afghan capital. This month, gunmen shot and killed a Swedish journalist. In January, a bomb and gun attack by the Taliban on a restaurant in Kabul killed 21 people, most of them foreigners. Earlier Thursday, in eastern Afghanistan, Taliban militants stormed a police station in Jalalabad, the country's Interior Ministry said. At least 11 people were killed and 22 were injured in the ensuing gunbattle, and at least six attackers were killed, according to a doctor at the hospital. The militant group has threatened to carry out attacks before next month's presidential election.

"(CNN) -- Lawrence G. Foster, former Johnson & Johnson corporate vice president of public relations, died Thursday morning, according to his son, Lawrence G. Foster III. He was 88 years old. Foster was at the helm during the public relations storm in 1982 when seven people died after ingesting poison-laced Tylenol. Foster stepped in to ensure that 32 million bottles of the over-the-counter medicine were removed from shelves. He was lauded for his transparency during the crisis and the example he set is still taught in business and public relations schools. Foster died of natural causes at his home in Westfield, New Jersey, with family present, said his son. ""He was a man of uncommon generosity and faith. I think that summarizes him perfectly,"" said his son in a statement to CNN. Foster's longstanding career with the pharmaceutical company began in 1957 when he was lured to the company under the challenge of building Johnson & Johnson's first public relations department, according to the Public Relations Society of America. He worked at the company for 33 years before retiring in 1990. According to his alma mater, Pennsylvania State University, Foster was the recipient of four of the highest awards in public relations: the 1989 Gold Anvil Award from the Public Relations Society of America, for contributions to the profession; the 1998 Atlas Award from PRSA, for lifetime achievement in international public relations; the Hall of Fame Award from the Arthur W. Page Society in 1994; and the Institute for Public Relations' Alexander Hamilton Medal for lifetime achievement in 2007.

"(CNN) -- More than 160,000 people flocked to the tenth Coachella music festival in April, signaling the start of the annual summer music festival season worldwide. Bestival, on the Isle of Wight, was voted last year's ""Best Lineup"" in the UK. The equivalent of a small city materialized for three days amid the searing heat and palm tree lined fields in east California, featuring performances from Paul McCartney, Leonard Cohen, and TV on the Radio. From silent disco parties at Bonnaroo in Tennessee to all-night raves at Serbia's Exit festival, our guide prepares music fans worldwide for another year of summer music festivals in the sun. BONNAROO, Tennessee, U.S.  June 11-14 ($235) The word ""bonnaroo"" is New Orleans slang for ""the best on the streets,"" and the Bonnaroo festival has grown into that name over the past eight years, winning Rolling Stone magazine's ""Best Festival"" award in 2008. In addition to promoting mainstream and independent rock, hip-hop, and electronic groups, Bonnaroo also features a stand-up comedians' tent and a ""silent disco"" tent -- where everyone gets a pair of headphones that sync up with the music for late night dancing without the noise complaints. Over 80,000 people will head to the festival outside of Nashville to see headliners including Bruce Springsteen, Phish, and Snoop Dogg. GLASTONBURY, Somerset, England June 24-28 ($255) Glastonbury has been around since dairy farmer Michael Eavis first held a free-two day festival on his farm in 1970, and it's long been the festival in England for seeing the biggest and best bands in the world. It also may be the muddiest -- heavy rain in several years, most notably 1997, turned Glastonbury into a muddy bog. Everyone from Radiohead to Jay-Z has headlined the festival, and with over 700 acts each year, there is something for everybody, and some of the proceeds from the festival go to Oxfam and Greenpeace. This year's headliners include Franz Ferdinand, Blur, and Bruce Springsteen. ROCK AL PARQUE, Bogota, Colombia June 27-29 (free) The Rock al Parque festival, launched in 1995, has become South America's biggest rockfest in recent years -- some 320,000 people traveled to Simon Bolivar Park in 2006 for a weekend of Colombia's biggest rock bands and renowned international headliners. Funded by Colombia's culture secretary, the free festival has included some of rock's biggest names, including Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, Manu Chao, and Bloc Party. In the days leading up to Rock al Parque, the festival organizers host a series of panel discussions on music production, management, and the recording industry. ROSKILDE, Denmark July 2-5 ($220) Since 1971, the rock festival in Roskilde has hosted the biggest names in music, from Bob Marley to Bob Dylan. It is the biggest summer festival in northern Europe, and the ""Arena"" stage boasts a 17,000-capacity tent, the largest in Europe. The festival boasts a daily newspaper and a 24-hour live radio station, and is also home to the annual ""Naked Run,"" where the first naked person to cross the finish line receives a free ticket for next year's festival. Some 80,000 will travel to Roskilde to see headliners including Coldplay, Oasis and Nine Inch Nails. EXIT, Novi Sad, Serbia July 9-12 ($105) Created in 2000 by three university students as a protest against former Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic, the electro-focused festival in the heart of Serbia was named Europe's best festival in 2007. Over 200,000 people attended Exit last year, dancing at all night raves in the gorgeous surroundings of Petrovaradin Fortress, an eighteenth century castle near the Danube River. Some of techno's biggest names will be on hand to celebrate Exit's 10-year anniversary, including Moby, Kraftwerk, and The Prodigy. THISDAY, Abuja/Lagos, Nigeria Dates tbc . The THISDAY festival in Nigeria, launched in 2006 by the editor-in-chief of Thisday newspaper, Nduka Obaigbena, to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the end of slavery, is the biggest music and fashion festival in Africa. According to Obaigbena, the festival is meant to highlight the positive progress being made in Africa, and find sustainable solutions for the continent's problems. The theme of last year's festival was ""Africa Rising,"" and it showcased some of the world's biggest artists including Jay-Z, Rihanna, and Usher. Stay tuned for this year's lineup. FUJI ROCK, Naeba, Japan July 24-26 ($410) Japan's biggest outdoor festival takes its name from Mt. Fuji, the site of the first festival in 1997. Fuji Rock has been set amongst the cool forested mountains of the Naeba ski resort for the past ten years -- gondolas and hilly trails transport people from stage to stage, and the streams and forests between them are the reason why Fuji Rock has been called the most beautiful festival in the world. It's not just about the scenery, though -- over 100,000 people will trek through the mountains to see headliners Franz Ferdinand, The Killers, and Weezer. LOLLAPALOOZA, Chicago, U.S. August 7-9 ($190) Rocker Perry Farrell began Lollapalooza in 1991 as a farewell tour for his band, Jane's Addiction. The biggest grunge rock festival during the nineties disappeared for awhile around the turn of the century, but it was revived in 2005 as a more traditional ""big weekend"" destination festival in Chicago. The past few years at Grant Park have been marked by hot summers, huge crowds, and even bigger bands. The anticipated crowd of nearly 200,000 is staggering, as are this year's headliners: Kings of Leon, Tool, Depeche Mode, and Beastie Boys, just to name a few. BESTIVAL, Isle of Wight, England September 11-13 ($205) The trendy Bestival, the original boutique weekend festival on the Isle of Wight, is the best way to end the summer festival season in Europe. Bestival boasts a yearly fancy dress competition -- last year was ""30,000 freaks under the sea,"" and 2009 is the year of ""Outer Space,"" so make sure to dress accordingly. Thousands of Bestival-goers will witness an eclectic lineup including Lily Allen, Massive Attack, and MGMT in the picturesque surroundings of Robin Hill Park. For family fun, look no further than Camp Bestival, a three day family festival at a castle by the sea in July. PARKLIFE, Australia Late September-Early October . The Parklife one-day music festivals kick off the summer festival season across Australia. The dance-focused fests have featured heavyweights Justice, MIA, and Muscles over the past two years. The day-long festivals are followed by an official ""After Life"" party that runs until the early hours of the morning, so be prepared for a long one if you're one of the estimated 100,000 people attending a Parklife gig in one of capital cities across Australia at the end of September. WOODSTOCK, Cape Town, South Africa Late Fall 2009   When people think of Woodstock, Cape Town isn't necessarily what comes to mind. But for the past decade, the South African festival has been the biggest youth music event in the country, hosting a variety of both well-known and upcoming mainstream and hip-hop acts -- not to mention a variety of extreme sports stunt acts, paintballing, and flea-market stalls. Woodstock may not have the star power of the legendary American festival -- but with the wide range of music and outdoor activities it presents, its promoters aren't lying when they say that boredom simply isn't an option. SUNBURN, Goa, India  December 2009 . Sunburn Festival launched in December 2007 as south Asia's first electronic music festival, and featured heavyweights like Carl Cox and John '00' Fleming. Located seaside in Goa, on India's west coast, the festival has its roots in ""Goa Trance,"" a type of pulsing, transcendental electro music that became popular in the early 1990s. Sunburn again treated over 5,000 electro revelers to a three-day party by the beach in December 2008. The festival's founder has said Sunburn will always be free to attend, and it is not to be missed if you happen to be in India in December.","CNN has put together a list of some of the best music festivals in the world .

"(CNN) -- There was no one else like him, certainly not in our time, likely not ever. Is this an overstatement? Put it this way: How would you ever typecast Philip Seymour Hoffman? Gangster? Priest? Cop? Super villain? Spy? Schoolteacher? Sybarite? Vagrant? A president of the United States? Let's put it another way: Who could you imagine doing all these things in ways that no one else had done before? Just so. No one. Hoffman, who was found dead at 46 of an apparent drug overdose Sunday, had at one time or another played some of those above-mentioned roles and did with an open-hearted incisiveness that unsettled presumptions and awakened possibilities. When Hoffman was onscreen, you knew you were going to see a kind of person who, while you may not have personally encountered in real life, you acknowledged as a plausible human being, no matter how quirky or disorienting his personality. Whether he was playing the manipulative, abusive, but emotionally needy cult leader in 2012's ""The Master"" (to these eyes, his finest big-screen performance), a crusty, disheveled but faintly idealistic CIA operator in 2007's ""Charlie Wilson's War"" or a pampered, egocentric but observant rich boy in 1999's ""The Talented Mr. Ripley,"" Hoffman layered his technical skills with compassion, insight and sense of risk. Those skills were not inconsiderable. He packed a resonant voice that could vault several octaves above its normal deep-dyed wooly tone. (Look no further than his Oscar-winning performance in the title role of 2005's ""Capote."") 5 reasons we loved Philip Seymour Hoffman . He exercised a meticulous sense of detail, lightly tailored for each role, no matter how ludicrous (""Mission: Impossible III's"" grimy, wealthy and sadistic bad-guy-in-charge) or familiar (""Moneyball's"" blustery, seen-it-all team manager). His was the kind of versatility commonly associated with the character actor more than with the movie star. Yet it was Hoffman's broad range and penetrating compassion that made him, if not a star, a reliable brand name for movies that aimed higher than commercial cinema usually bothered. You looked forward to seeing Hoffman's name in the credits, if only to see what kind of weirdness was in store. It wasn't apparent at first how far and how fast Hoffman's oddly configured star would rise. Depending on how long you'd been going to the movies, you might have first noticed him as the petulant, trigger-happy small-town policeman in 1994's ""Nobody's Fool"" or as the swaggering, borderline-deranged craps player in 1996's ""Hard Eight."" Neither of these performances prepared you for his sweet, out-of-left-field portrayal of Scotty J, a gay, grubby-puppy production assistant for a porn-movie outfit in 1997's ""Boogie Nights."" After a while, the only thing you expected from Hoffman was the unexpected. He gave a persuasive, tender rendering in 2000's ""Almost Famous"" of the ill-fated rock critic Lester Bangs (whose premature drug-related death, not depicted in the film, deepens the poignancy of Hoffman's own). A succession of misfits, screw-ups, neurotics, thwarted dreamers and self-deluded narcissists followed offset by such complicated, intriguing characters as the tormented visionary theater director Caden Cotard in 2008's ""Synecdoche, New York."" Cotard is one of the few characters in Hoffman's curriculum vitae whose massive urges for sex, adulation and control are sated, but whose more cosmic yearnings remain unfulfilled. Even when not playing someone clinging to life's margins, Hoffman played his own worst enemy. Perhaps that's what endeared him to us the most, this unlikely icon of craftsmanship whose physical presence called to mind how Dorothy Parker once described James Thurber's cartoon characters: Having the ""outer semblance of unbaked cookies."" From this loose, somewhat baggy set of physical attributes, Hoffman sculpted vivid depictions of the human heart at its most besieged and overwhelmed. The effort he put into these renderings showed he cared about the unlucky, the awkward and (despite it all) the most dauntless among us. Is all this overstatement? Only if you can think of anyone else who will carry on in his absence. And I'm stumped ... and sad. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gene Seymour.","Gene Seymour: There was no other actor like Philip Seymour Hoffman .

"New York (CNN) -- The defendant's testimony in a stilled Manhattan courtroom Wednesday took a federal jury half a world and many years away, to a mountain cave in the desolation of Afghanistan, to the hours after the September 11, 2001, terror attacks. In that mountain cave, defendant Sulaiman Abu Ghaith testified, sat the man who had summoned him, his future father-in law: Osama bin Laden. Bin Laden invited him to sit, Abu Ghaith said, and then asked if he'd heard what happened. ""We are the ones who did it,"" Abu Ghaith, speaking through an Arabic interpreter, quoted bin Laden as saying. Bin Laden then asked for his opinion of what to expect, Abu Ghaith said. ""America will not rest until it accomplishes two things,"" Abu Ghaith testified he told bin Laden. ""To kill you, and to destroy the Taliban."" ""You're being too pessimistic,"" bin Laden responded. Abu Ghaith's testimony came on the ninth day of his trial on federal charges that he aided terrorists relating to the 9/11 attacks and conspired to kill U.S. nationals. He has pleaded not guilty to charges that could send him to prison for life if he is convicted. As he testified Wednesday, several survivors of the attacks and family members of victims sat in the courtroom just blocks away from the World Trade Center and ground zero. Prosecutors in the terror trial contend Abu Ghaith was an al Qaeda propagandist, with a crucial role in recruiting and inciting the organization's members. Prosecutors have played videos for the jury of Abu Ghaith seated at bin Laden's side, giving speeches filled with fiery rhetoric and issuing calls to ""terrorize the infidels."" The defendant said he initially met bin Laden in June of 2001, when he traveled to Afghanistan on ""a mission that you may call humanitarian,"" because of his curiosity about the Islamist Taliban government, and because he thought his skills as an educator and religious scholar could be of use there. In his native Kuwait, Abu Ghaith spent a decade working for the Ministry of Education, and was a licensed imam with a reputation in the Gulf region, he said on the stand. Shortly after his arrival in the country, Abu Ghaith said, bin Laden summoned him for the first of several meetings. Bin Laden invited him to speak at training camps, saying the men there were exposed to ""weapons, roughness, and a hard life,"" but needed spiritual focus and a lesson in mercy, testified Abu Ghaith. At the camps, he heard talk there was a big al Qaeda operation in the works, he said, but he denied knowing the specifics of the 2001 attack ahead of time. The first of the video recordings was made at the September 11 meeting, after bin Laden asked for a reluctant Abu Ghaith's help to send a worldwide message, Abu Ghaith testified. He relented only after bin Laden promised to give him ""bullet points,"" and that he'd speak on religious matters only. ""The storm of airplanes will not abate,"" Abu Ghaith said on one of the recordings, a phrase he testified Wednesday was among the notes bin Laden gave him for the speech. He maintained in court that his use of ""we"" and ""us"" in the videos referred to Muslims and not to al Qaeda, and that he was never a member of the organization. Abu Ghaith was not asked on the stand about his subsequent marriage to one of bin Laden's daughters. Abu Ghaith was captured last year after years of being among a group of alleged al Qaeda operatives sheltered in Iran. He was arrested in Turkey and deported to Kuwait via Jordan, which helped U.S. agents capture him. Testimony continues Thursday, with two remaining defense witnesses. Closing arguments in the case are expected Monday.

"Dubai (CNN) -- A Norwegian woman who was sentenced to prison in Dubai after reporting that she was raped has been given a pardon and will be heading home soon, she said Monday. Speaking to reporters in Dubai, Marte Deborah Dalelv seemed relieved and happy as she confirmed the news -- if still slightly bewildered by the swift turn of events. ""They told me that I would be pardoned and that they were going to give me my passport back, so I got it immediately,"" she said. Asked what happens next, Dalelv paused a moment before replying: ""I get to go home."" She added, ""We want to make it as soon as possible."" Dalelv has her passport in her possession and filed the paperwork for an exit visa Monday afternoon. She hopes to find out Tuesday when she can leave the country. A spokeswoman for Norway's Foreign Ministry, Ragnhild Imerslund, said Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum had said Dalelv was free to travel where she wants and can remain in Dubai if she chooses. The sheikh, who is vice president of the United Arab Emirates, also said the 24-year-old had not been and would not be deported, Imerslund said. She is expected to travel in a day or two, the spokeswoman said. Dalelv, a Qatar-based interior designer, was on a work trip to Dubai when she reported to police that she had been raped by a colleague at the hotel where she was staying. She was herself then detained and charged with having unlawful sex, making a false statement and illegal consumption of alcohol. A court last week sentenced her to 16 months in prison, prompting outrage in Norway. Dalelv's lawyer, Mahmoud Azab Abu Gareda, said the sheikh's pardon is ""effectively a royal decree,"" which wipes the slate clean, leaving no record of her conviction. This means the alleged perpetrator, who was charged with public intoxication and having sex outside of marriage, also walks free, he said. Dalelv has dropped her case against him, so it will not be pursued further, he said. Men convicted of raping Swiss tourist in India . 'Fantastic feeling' Dalelv said she had not known what to expect when she went into a meeting Monday with the Dubai attorney general, her lawyers and Norway's ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, Ase Elin Bjerke. ""I just went in with an open mind, and they said, 'Well, we are pardoning you.' This is such a good day,"" Dalelv said. ""Now I get my exit visa, and then I am going home to see my mum!"" Dalelv gave insight into the pressure she has been under, saying that she knew what had happened to her but that she had started to believe she was ""guilty emotionally."" She said it was a ""fantastic feeling"" to have her freedom back and be able to leave Dubai, but at the same time she would miss the friends she has made. Bjerke, Norway's envoy, said that her country had been working on Dalelv's behalf for several months and that she was very grateful for the decision to issue a pardon. Bjerke said the case had resonated on social media in Norway and elsewhere. ""I think people can see themselves in Marte,"" she said. ""She has done what a lot of people would do when they come and visit Dubai. You are out with your friends ,and things roll on that you are not in control of. She is happy now, and we are happy with her, and she can return free to Norway."" Norway has a ""very good"" relationship with the United Arab Emirates, Bjerke said, adding that she credited the openness between the two nations for the outcome of this case. Islamic laws, traditions . Norwegian Foreign Affairs Minister Espen Barth Eide also welcomed news of Dalelv's pardon. ""Marte is released! Thanks to everyone who signed up to help #ReleaseMarte,"" his Twitter feed said. Imerslund said ""very constructive"" dialogue between the foreign ministers of Norway and the UAE, along with international pressure and interest, led to this outcome in Dalelv's case. On Friday, Eide had called his UAE counterpart, Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, to protest Dalelv's conviction as ""contrary to fundamental human rights,"" a weekend statement from the Norwegian ministry said. While Dubai has a reputation as a cosmopolitan city that boasts Western influences, where visitors can drink at bars and restaurants and unmarried couples can share hotel rooms, the country adheres to Islamic laws and traditions. Having sex outside of marriage and public consumption of alcohol are both violations of the law in the United Arab Emirates. Women's rights violations not just a developing nation issue . Fired from her job . Dalelv no longer has a job with the company that sent her on the work assignment to Dubai. She said that a month after the rape, while forced to stay in Dubai as the case wound through the legal system, she was fired by her employer, Al Mana Interiors. A representative of Al Mana Interiors, who declined to be publicly identified, said Saturday that Dalelv and the Sudanese man she accused -- who is married with three children -- were both terminated by Al Mana Interiors for ""drinking alcohol at a staff conference that resulted in trouble with the police."" A statement released later the same day by Al Mana Interiors spokesman Hani El Korek said that the company was sympathetic toward Dalelv ""during this very difficult situation"" and that her dismissal was not because of the rape claim. The statement said that company representatives were by her side through the initial investigation, spending ""days at both the police station and the prosecutor's office to help win her release."" ""Only when Ms. Dalelv declined to have positive and constructive discussions about her employment status, and ceased communication with her employer, was the company forced to end our relationship with her,"" the statement said. ""The decision had nothing to do with the rape allegation, and unfortunately neither Ms. Dalelv nor her attorneys have chosen to contact the company to discuss her employment status."" The company is owned by Qatari billionaire Wissam Al Mana, who made headlines this year after it was revealed that he secretly married singer Janet Jackson in 2012. Raped on the job in America's fields . Rights record criticized . The United Arab Emirates has been heavily criticized by rights groups that say it condones sexual violence against women. Human Rights Watch has called its record ""shameful,"" saying it must change the way it handles such cases. In December 2012, a British woman reported being raped by three men in Dubai. She was found guilty of drinking alcohol without a license and fined. In January 2010, a British woman told authorities she was raped by an employee at a Dubai hotel. She was charged with public intoxication and having sex outside of marriage. An Australian woman reported in 2008 that she was drugged and gang-raped. She was convicted of having sex outside marriage and drinking alcohol, and she was sentenced to 11 months in prison. Amanpour: What's next for women's rights in the Middle East?

"(Time) -- No, ""six strikes"" isn't a phrase from some esoteric version of baseball played on Mars — it's a colloquialism for a new anti-piracy warning system designed to track copyright infringers and help internet service providers (ISPs) take progressively punitive measures to discourage or prevent said infringers from engaging in further copyright-violating activities. It's essentially an industry workaround, after SOPA and PIPA — bills designed to give the government increased power to battle copyright violators — failed or stalled last year. But ""six strikes"" is notably different from either SOPA or PIPA. For starters, it's not a bill. Instead of empowering the government to blacklist sites deemed illicit, it's an escalating warning system managed by ISPs independently. It employs a third-party tool, MarkMonitor, to identify users engaging in copyright-violating activities, then leaves it up to ISPs to take action. ISPs participating at this point include AT&T, Verizon, Comcast, Cablevision and Time Warner Cable. Say an IP address associated with your account is identified as a violator. Your ISP would first send you a warning, then send further warnings for each infraction, at some point rolling out actual punitive measures, from throttling your bandwidth up to — in theory, a possibility — termination of your service. The system was supposed to go live this week, but was delayed at the last minute by the Center for Copyright Information (CCI), the group working with the Motion Picture Association of America, the Recording Industry Association of America and several of the nation's biggest ISPs to roll ""six strikes"" out. According to CCI executive director Jill Lesser, the delay, due to ""unexpected factors,"" is mostly because of Superstorm Sandy, which ""seriously affected"" the group's final testing plans. CCI says it now expects what it calls the ""Copyright Alert System"" to kick off in early 2013, adding: . ""Our goal has always been to implement the program in a manner that educates consumers about copyright and peer-to-peer networks, encourages the use of legal alternatives, safeguards customer privacy, and provides an easy-to-use independent review program for consumers to challenge alerts they believe they've received in error. ""We need to be sure that all of our ""I""s are dotted and ""T""s crossed before any company begins sending alerts, and we know that those who are following our progress will agree."" Regardless of when it goes live, I'm worried about some of those I's and T's — specifically what it's going to mean for me, speaking not as a copyright violator, but as someone whose somewhat unique residential situation poses some awkward, potentially nightmarish alert management issues. My condo complex (I'm an owner) has 48 units. It was built in 2003, so it's relatively new. At the time, the builders had the foresight to wire each unit with Ethernet — a drop in each room, everything connected back to aggregate wire closets. Near my front door (and all the front doors of all the units) is a mini-wire closet with a switch/hub that connects my unit to a central switch/hub in a locked room on the property. That, in turn, plugs into a high-speed cable modem — a cable modem that's shared across all 48 units. We're technically shielded from each other using a special box that ""firewalls"" each private IP and can control how much bandwidth it's allocated, etc. Whether we elect to use it or pay for our own service instead, all 48 units have access to this shared Internet. You can probably see where I'm headed. With ""six strikes,"" any of the residents in the complex who — knowingly or unknowingly — engage in an act of copyright violation, could incur an alert. Who's going to see that alert? Probably me, as the technical contact for the ISP (that, or our property management company, at which point it'll route back to me). At this point I'm not sure what happens. The IP address MarkMonitor's software is going to see, presumably, is our public one, not the private address of the device that's been singled out on our condo complex's network. How do we identify the perpetrator? Should we identify the perpetrator? If our ISP says we're in violation, is it incumbent on us to run our own tracking software, somehow, to identify the person(s) involved? Are we supposed to somehow issue these warnings ourselves, since the ISP won't technically be able to? See the problem? Who's responsible for each infraction? Who should be punished? The entire complex, by throttling or at some point terminating our Internet service? Each unit in the complex pays for shared Internet equally as part of our monthly association fees. We're not a business — there's no CEO. The few of us who manage the Internet on behalf of the rest can't act unilaterally to preempt potential infractions by blocking aspects of the service by introducing content filters the way a private company might. It's a delicate, thorny issue. Anyone who's been on the board of a housing association knows how tough it can be to promulgate policies to owners, much less policies where the repercussions of violations can't be controlled locally, and where the punishment extends to everyone. We could put it to a complex-wide vote, but even if a majority were in favor of taking action, say somehow shutting off file-sharing activity entirely, now we're talking about an all or nothing ""fix"" that also blocks legitimate file sharing — sharing anything not copyrighted, e.g. game or application demos, some music (freely released albums, for instance), public domain materials (Project Gutenberg's texts, for instance, or public domain art). I wouldn't vote for neutering my Internet service, would you? I'm assuming this scenario applies, more or less, anywhere you'll find shared Internet provided by a ""six strikes""-participating ISP. We've heard nothing about exemptions. So what about hotels? Restaurants? Coffee shops? Fitness centers? Libraries? Bookstores? RV Parks? Airports? What about municipal initiatives to beam free Wi-Fi to anyone at all, citywide? Maybe the ""workaround"" lies in the acknowledgment portion of the process. According to reports, users found in violation of ""six strikes"" will have to somehow acknowledge they've received and read the alert explaining their account was engaged in illicit activity. Some ISPs are said to be rolling this out as pop-ups (don't ask me how). I'm not sure what that entails for shared Internet access. Does everyone get the pop-up? What happens if you ignore it? What happens if, for whatever reason, the pop-up doesn't appear in the first place? Like the proverbial tree in the forest, does an alert count as a strike if you don't see (or acknowledge having seen) it? I'd like to see the CCI and participating ISPs lay all the details about ""six strikes"" on the table, proactively, instead of letting them trickle out in leaked documents and casual interviews. Don't just backdoor the policy and expect users, especially where Internet's shared, to somehow reverse-engineer what they're responsible for, what happens if they fail to meet some new policy threshold and so forth. Be upfront with customers. Sure, they already know (or they should) that copyright violations are no-nos, per the terms of their user agreements (and the law), but they deserve to know when policies for policing those terms change, especially when those policies could seriously impact them whether they're personally responsible for a copyright violation or not. Maybe ""six strikes"" isn't designed to produce lawsuits. Maybe it really is just an ""educational"" campaign to raise violation awareness among users. Maybe it's just to remind us that someone's watching (and possibly storing information for potential lawsuits). Whatever the case, there's a transparency issue here. I'm worried that the absence of public engagement may be intentional — an attempt to manage the perception of what's about to happen by keeping it quiet (or at best, confusingly disclosed), in hopes of preventing another public relations fiasco, like the bill-killing blowup over SOPA and PIPA. If CCI really wants this to work as claimed — to educate users — then it needs to work with ISPs to lay out the parameters beforehand, addressing scenarios like the one I've described above, ""I's dotted and T's crossed."" &copy 2012 TIME, Inc.

"(CNN) -- Google might need a find new home for its giant floating showroom in San Francisco Bay. No, the company isn't the latest victim of skyrocketing Bay Area real estate costs. It seems Google is under fire from state authorities for not having the proper permits necessary to construct the barge in its current location. The four-story structure is housed at Treasure Island, a small piece of land between San Francisco and Oakland. The barge rose to fame late last year as a delightful floating enigma in the San Francisco Bay. The vessel was originally spotted by a CNET reporter and Google would not comment on its purpose. People had great fun speculating about the barge, guessing that it was a floating data center, a Google Glass shop or a luxury event space. It was dubbed the Google Mystery Barge. Eventually, Google killed the mystery, and some of the fun, by announcing the structure was going to be an ""interactive space where people can learn about new technology."" But shortly after the story picked up steam, Google hit pause on construction of the barge. The U.S. Coast Guard inspected the structure and the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC) announced it was meeting with Google about the matter in December. The opening date for the barge was delayed until late 2014, according to CNET, and the boat sat idle in its Treasure Island home. This week, the BCDC officially notified The Treasure Island Development Authority (TIDA) that it did not have the necessary permits to construct and lodge any ships at the pier where the Google barge is currently moored. TIDA manages the island on behalf of the city of San Francisco. ""We are asking TIDA to work with us so that the necessary permits can be applied for and completed to enable lawful activities to be undertaken at the site in the future (perhaps including shipbuilding and repair),"" said Larry Goldzband, executive director of the BCDC. That means that for now, Treasure Island must relocate the Google ship to another shipbuilding facility in order to comply with state law. To get its paperwork into ship shape, Google will also have to get the proper permits from the BCDC to moor its marketing vessel in an approved area in San Francisco Bay, one that is already permitted to do this type of construction. ""We just received the letter from the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission and we are reviewing it,"" said a Google spokesperson in an e-mail. Now the biggest mystery is when, if ever, the project will be finished and open its doors to the public.","Google does not have the proper permits for its showroom barge, state says .

"(CNN) -- Much as I love the Internet — and I love it thiiiiiiiis much! — it is not a physical space. And no factor so directly and causally affects us as our physical space. The temperature in your room determines which drawers you'll open when you're choosing your clothes. The location of your stove determines where you'll cook. The distance to the front door determines the magnitude of the interruption when someone knocks. The fact that stores are away from our homes explains entire concepts like ""errands."" Half of what I find annoying in life is due to things not being near me when I want them. The space we're in is deeply determinative of the lives we lead. So, when a CEO says that I can't work at home any more, it's very much like being fired from one job and hired for another without anyone asking if I agree to the deal. CEO right: Yahoo workers must show up . For me, this is ultimately the arrogance of Marissa Mayer's mandate that Yahoo employees can no longer work from home. Which is a way of saying that I want to skip two other arguments. The first is about whether letting people work from home is good or bad for a business. I think we all agree that physical proximity breeds an intimacy that online connections cannot, and it enables sustained creative development that online interactions inhibit. Policy riles workers everywhere . Except we don't all agree. For instance, I don't. I've worked at home for many years over the past couple of decades, and I don't believe I always work better in an office. After all, the main point of space is to keep things apart, whereas the Net only exists as a set of connections. And the Net as a social platform is getting so sophisticated that for many sorts of ideas at many stages of development, it makes the real world look like a big box of 404s. (Disclosure: I work in an office with hugely creative people and enjoy it.) Slightly more scientifically: The research data on this topic are hard to generalize from. For example, studies that show that dispersed coding teams work more slowly may simply be an indication that these dispersed teams need better tools or management. And perhaps in particular circumstances a balanced approach — Together Tuesdays! — might work. So, that's the first argument I don't want to have. At least not here. Who works from home and how they do it . The second is about whether Marissa Mayer is a hypocritical, entitled, privileged, spoiled 1%'er because she gets to bring her infant to work with her. The content of her character is irrelevant to whether she's made a good decision. Even entitled 1%'ers are sometimes right. So let's not have that argument either. Instead I want to ask what sort of decision Mayer has made. Point No. 1 is where we began: A change in place is one of the most profound changes one can make. Imagine you are working at home and your company gives you the choice of either working 9 to 5 in the office or moving to another state where you will be allowed to telecommute. I personally would have considered moving. Perhaps you wouldn't. But the point is that those two choices are roughly equivalent for many of us. That's how big a deal it is to be told to show up for work every day. It's a big, big deal. A work-at-home mom defends Yahoo's Mayer . Point No. 2 is that Mayer clearly has issued this edict to send a signal. Otherwise, she would have announced that Yahoo is going to re-evaluate the work-at-home folks on an individual basis. If your job passes the test, congrats, you can stay in your bathrobe. But requiring everyone to show up all the time is a signal expressed as a policy. The problem is that if you send a signal by, say, firing off a flare, you're supposed to aim the flare well over the heads of the folks in the lifeboat. If you aim it at them and set some of them on fire, it's not a signal any more. It's an assault with a bright weapon. Opinion: Allow Yahoo workers to work at home . So, while Mayer has successfully signaled that Yahoo is desperate, the signal contains other messages, as well. The first message is that she distrusts her employees, and distrusts the Net.

"(CNN) -- Sure, it's a veiled shot at stoners, but it also shows cops can have a sense of humor about marijuana legalization. The Seattle Police Department announced on its Twitter feed that officers will attend the city's Hempfest to hand out Doritos and literature explaining the new rules surrounding recreational marijuana use in the state. Minor marijuana possession has been the police department's lowest priority since 2003, but voters last year cast ballots to make recreational use legal. Before Seattle residents start farming ganja on their stoops, the police want to make a few things clear (such as, you can't grow marijuana on your stoop yet). ""Yes, we will be @seattlehempfest. But we'll be giving out @Doritos & #Marijwhatnow literature. Please make a note of it. See you Saturday!"" read the Wednesday tweet. Initiative 502 states that beginning December 6 residents over 21 years old may possess up to an ounce of pot for personal use. There are also guidelines for the possession of oils and edibles. Hempfest, which begins Friday and runs through Sunday, says its goal is ""to educate the public on the myriad of potential benefits offered by the cannabis plant, including the medicinal, industrial, agricultural, economic, environmental, and other benefits and applications."" The Wednesday tweet set off a witty back-and-forth with residents who seem charmed by the police department's light-hearted means of educating the public on a serious matter. But it didn't come without rumor and innuendo. Responding to one such vicious affont, the department tweeted, ""Please ignore maliciously false reports that we're giving out Bugles at @seattlehempfest. We would never, ever do that.""","Seattle PD tweets it will attend Hempfest to hand out Doritos, weed literature .

"Guatemala City, Guatemala (CNN) -- In a country where 20% of people live on less than a dollar a day, Richard Grinnell is doing his level best to help the impoverished people of Guatemala. Grinnell runs an American charity here called Helps International, which arranges medical procedures done by American doctors and provides stoves to the poorest of the poor. So when he heard that 15 small American charities that have nothing to do with foreign aid claimed to have sent $40 million worth of medicines to Guatemala in a single year, he was surprised, to say the least. Grinnell said his charity runs 15,000 clinics throughout Guatemala at a cost of about $300,000 a year. ""Any charity that spends even a million dollars a year would be huge,"" he said. Documents obtained by CNN show that Charity Services International, a private South Carolina company, claimed to have shipped nearly $40 million in medicines and other donations on behalf of 15 small charities to Guatemala in 2010. Those same charities also reported sending another $10 million to Guatemala the next year. According to its tax filings, one of those American charities, The Breast Cancer Society of Mesa, Arizona, claimed to have shipped $22 million of donations by itself in 2010. But a joint investigation by CNN, the Tampa Bay Times and the Center for Investigative Reporting could find no trace of even a fraction of those donations. CNN traveled across Guatemala to find these medicines, starting with the Order of Malta, which was listed as the biggest recipient of Charity Services International's alleged donations. All the American charity donations were funneled through the downtown Guatemala City office of the Order of Malta, a centuries-old charity with links to the Catholic Church that is accorded diplomatic status by some countries. At the downtown building listed as the Order of Malta's headquarters, a building manager said it had been five years since the Order of Malta had offices there. Inside another office building with an impressive sign saying it was the ""Embassy"" of the Order of Malta, an assistant said no one was inside. About an hour's drive outside the capital, a guard stood outside a gated iron fence with a sign for the Order of Malta. The guard said the fence surrounded a warehouse with donated medicines, but he refused to allow CNN access. A spokesman for the Order of Malta , Enrique Hegel, later told CNN that it received two or three shipments a month in 2010 and 2011 from American charities, ""depending on the season."" He would not respond to other questions. Robert Gramajo, who signed for some of those donations in 2010 and 2011, said he never saw any dollar amounts listed for the goods he received. He also told CNN that the Order of Malta closed a clinic that had offered free mammograms for Guatemalan women in 2011 because there were no funds to continue its operation. Gramajo, who said he left the Order of Malta two years ago, now operates his own charity. What's this all about? Charity watchdog groups said some American charities want to impress potential donors and therefore claim huge amounts of dollar values in medicines and other goods shipped abroad to poor countries. In reality, these charities send small amounts of goods and state regulators say they inflate the values time and time again. Roy Tidwell, CEO of Charity Services International, declined to say what precisely comprised the millions of dollars of goods sent to Guatemala, citing confidentiality for his clients. But he said in an e-mail that all the donations were valued by the charities and not by his shipping office. That's not so, according to a spokeswoman for the Breast Cancer Society, one of the 15 small charities that donated items to Guatemala through Charity Services International. Spokeswoman Kristina Hixson said it was Charity Services International that provided all the valuations. Hixon also said Breast Cancer Society had ""amended"" some of its IRS filings to eliminate $12 million worth of claimed donations to Guatemala.  In addition, she said the Breast Cancer Society had given ""$36 million of medicines and supplies to those in desperate need"" to other Central American countries and to West African nations. Tampa Bay Times' charity checker . Back in the Guatemalan countryside, Richard Grinnell said he has never even heard of the Order of Malta nor any of the American charities that claimed to have donated millions and millions of dollars' worth of supplies. People in rural parts of the country, he said, are so impoverished that even a few dollars a day more and free medicine would mean the world. The huge donations claimed by these American charities, he said, just don't happen in his world. Center for Investigative Reporting: More on this story .

"(CNN) -- Could a massive passenger jet slip past radar, cross international borders and land undetected? That's a key question investigators are weighing as they continue the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which vanished March 8 on a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, bound for Beijing. Radar does have some blind spots, and it's possible to avoid being spotted by flying at low altitude, analysts told CNN. But experts are divided over whether that could be what happened to the missing Boeing 777-200ER. Jeffrey Beatty, a security consultant and former FBI special agent, says someone could have planned a route that avoided radar detection. ""It certainly is possible to fly through the mountains in that part of the world and not be visible on radar. Also, an experienced pilot, anyone who wanted to go in that direction, could certainly plot out all the known radar locations, and you can easily determine, where are the radar blind spots?"" he said. ""It's the type of things the Americans did when they went into Pakistan to go after Osama bin Laden."" Information about the plane's path came into sharper focus on Tuesday, when the Thai government released data that bolsters the belief among investigators that the missing jet took a sharp westward turn after communication was lost. The Thai military was receiving normal flight path and communication data from the jet on its planned route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing until 1:22 a.m., when it disappeared from its radar. Six minutes later, the Thai military detected an unknown signal, a Royal Thai Air Force spokesman told CNN. This unknown aircraft, possibly Flight 370, was heading in the opposite direction. Malaysia says the evidence suggests the plane was deliberately flown off course, turning westward and traveling back over the Malay Peninsula and out into the Indian Ocean. The Thai data corroborate what the Malaysian military had found earlier -- that the plane did indeed turn around toward the Strait of Malacca. But the Thai contact was short-lived. ""The unknown aircraft's signal was sending out intermittently, on and off, and on and off,"" the spokesman said. The Thai military lost the unknown aircraft's signal because of the limits of its military radar, he said. Satellite signals can confirm plane's identity . On Monday, the Malaysian newspaper New Straits Times reported that the plane may have evaded radar detection by flying at an altitude of 5,000 feet or less and through mountainous terrain. The newspaper cited unidentified sources for its reporting, which CNN could not confirm. A senior Indian military official told CNN on Monday that military radar near the Andaman and Nicobar Islands isn't as closely watched as are other radar systems. That leaves open the possibility that Indian radar systems may not have picked up the airplane at the time of its last known Malaysian radar contact, near the tiny island of Palau Perak in the Strait of Malacca. Malaysian officials said Monday that they were not aware of the Malaysian newspaper's report. ""It does not come from us,"" said Malaysia Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya. U.S. officials have said they think it's unlikely the plane flew northward over land as it veered off course. If it had, they've said, radar somewhere would have detected it. It's also unlikely that the plane was landed at a remote airport, since remote airports aren't typically equipped with the long runways that the Boeing jetliner needs, the officials have said. Analysts interviewed by CNN said that it would be extremely difficult to fly such a large aircraft so close to the ground over a long period of time, and that it's not even clear that doing so would keep the plane off radar scopes. Key moments in tracking missing airliner . ""Five thousand (feet) isn't really low enough to evade the radar, and that's kind of where general aviation flies all the time anyway, and we're visible to radar,"" said Mary Schiavo, a CNN aviation analyst and former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Transportation. ""It just seems really highly improbable, unless we've been overestimating a lot of other countries' radar system capabilities,"" said Daniel Rose, an aviation and maritime attorney. Buck Sexton, a former CIA officer who's now national security editor for TheBlaze.com, said radar would have detected the plane had it flown over land. ""This is a bus in the sky. It's a lot harder to get under the radar with this kind of thing than I think most people realize,"" he said. ""So really, while the search I know has extended to this vast area stretching up into (central or south Asia), clearly there really should be much more of a search over open water -- because this is not getting past people's radars."" It wouldn't be easy to avoid radar detection, but some experts say it could be done. ""Anything like this is possible,"" radar expert Greg Charvat told CNN's ""Piers Morgan Live."" ""But to do it, you'd have to have very detailed information of the type of radars, their disposition, their heights and their waveforms to pull that off."" Different countries would likely be using different radar systems, he said, but it's unclear how advanced the technology is in many countries. ""It took a great deal of skill to do this,"" CNN aviation analyst Jim Tilmon said. ""I think somebody was at the controls who understood the value of altitude control to eliminate the possibility of being spotted and tracked on radar."" Whoever was in control in the cockpit, he said, ""really had the ability to map out a route that was given the very best chance of not being detected."" One other possibility, he said: The plane could have shadowed another plane so closely that it slipped by radar detection. Other analysts say that would require so much skill that it would be nearly impossible to pull off without getting caught. There's another possible wrinkle, experts say. Some countries may be hesitant to reveal what they've seen on radar. ""They want to protect their own capabilities,"" Beatty said. ""Their intelligence services are not going to want to publicize exactly what their capabilities are."" Pilots, passengers under scrutiny . Politician: Pilot supported me, but was no hijacker .

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- Five of six men accused of plotting terrorist acts with al Qaeda were convicted Tuesday by a Miami jury after six days of deliberation, authorities said. Narseal Batiste, 35, was the only defendant found guilty of all four conspiracy charges. The six suspects were arrested in June 2006 for allegedly conspiring to blow up buildings, including the 110-story Sears Tower, the nation's tallest building, in Chicago, Illinois; the FBI's Miami office and others. The suspected ringleader, Narseal Batiste, 35, was the only defendant found guilty of all four conspiracy charges, including conspiring to incite a rebellion against the United States, supplying materials to a terror organization and terrorists, and conspiring to destroy buildings with explosives. Another defendant, Patrick Abraham, 29, was convicted of two counts involving supplying materials to terrorists and terror groups, and of conspiring to destroy buildings with explosives. Stanley Grant, 33, Burson Augustin, 24, and Rotschild Augustine, 25, were convicted of supplying materials to terrorists, but acquitted of the other charges. The sixth defendant, Naudimer Herrera, 25, was acquitted on all four counts. ""The jury has spoken,"" Abraham's attorney, Albert Z. Levin, told CNN after the verdicts. ""And we anxiously await our day in the court of appeals."" Nathan Clark, attorney for Rotschild Augustine, indicated his client would also appeal, saying, ""The fight has only just begun."" The terror trial in Miami was the third held for the defendants. Juries have twice deadlocked on verdicts for the group of homeless men initially known as the ""Liberty City 7,"" for the Miami neighborhood where authorities say they operated. In the first trial, a mistrial was declared after nine days of deliberations in December 2007, although a seventh defendant was acquitted. The jury in the second trial deadlocked in April 2008 after deliberating for 13 days. A sticking point for the first two juries was whether the defendants were actually seriously plotting with al Qaeda as the prosecutors alleged or if they were simply struggling young men who were looking to con an FBI informant out of money, as the defense alleged. Authorities have said the men did not have explosives or weapons and that their plans appeared ""more aspirational than operational."" The investigation began after an Arabic speaker contacted authorities, saying that Batiste approached him about waging ""jihad"" in the United States. Investigators then planted among the group an undercover informant, who claimed to be an al Qaeda member who helped plan the attack on the USS Cole in 2000. A federal raid on the group's Liberty City warehouse in 2006 revealed a receipt for purchase of a gun, as well as ammunition, marijuana, two credit cards, 10 euros, three machetes, two swords, an ax, uniforms and a flight suit. On a surveillance videotape played during trial, Batiste could be heard saying he was ""very grateful"" to Osama bin Laden and ""loved"" the al Qaeda leader's work. He also said he respected bin Laden and wanted to meet him someday. In other excerpts, Batiste told the informant his people needed training, and they discussed going to Chicago because the city has underground trains and tunnels. CNN's John Couwels contributed to this report.","Men accused of plotting terrorist acts with al Qaeda .

"(CNN) -- Democratic hopes for 2014, never good, are fading fast. The New York Times reported on the mood of panic among Democratic senators. Forecaster Charlie Cook is speculating about a Democratic Senate wipeout. It's suddenly looking very possible that Republicans could regain control of both houses of Congress for the first time in eight years. What then? The main thing to expect: You're going to hear a lot less about debt and deficits from Republicans and a lot more from Democrats. It's almost a rule of American politics that the losers of the last election talk about deficits, while the winners talk about what they want to do. It happened after 2008: Barack Obama's triumphant Democrats announced huge new spending plans; the defeated and discarded Republicans fulminated about red ink. It happened after the recount election of 2000. Then it was Republicans who had plans -- tax cuts, defense buildups -- and Democrats who fretted about the impact on the budget balance. It happened after the stunning Republican sweep in the congressional elections of 1994. Abruptly, President Clinton -- who had campaigned only two years earlier on a bold program of ""investments"" -- reinvented himself as Mr. Fiscal Responsibility. The triumphant Republicans sent Clinton tax cut after tax cut. He vetoed most of them, but finally signed a reduction in the capital gains tax in 1997, as part of a bargain to secure spending programs that he preferred. And so it will be if Republicans take full control of Congress after 2014. The debt crisis that used to present such a generational challenge? The new ""red menace"" -- this time of red ink rather than the Red Army? It will suddenly take a back seat to the need to accelerate economic growth by cutting tax rates. Meanwhile the Obama Democrats -- who five years ago accepted budget deficits of nearly 10% of GDP as indispensable to economic recovery -- will suddenly decide that the country's present deficit of less than half that amount is intolerable and unacceptable. The President's latest budget proposes to reduce the deficit below 2%, thanks in large part to new tax revenues generated by the lapse of the Bush tax cuts at the end of 2012 and the new Obamacare taxes that went into effect at the same time. If Republicans win in November 2014, they will try to send that money back home. President Obama will invoke ""fiscal responsibility,"" Clinton style, in hope of thwarting them. Deficit reduction is everybody's second favorite policy, after their first favorite, ""Doing what I want."" This may explain the seeming paradox that deficits tend to shrink during periods of divided government (like the final six years of the Clinton and Obama presidencies) and to widen during period of united government (like the first six years of the George W. Bush presidency and the first two years of Clinton and Obama). To put it even more bluntly: Deficits don't shrink because politicians reach Grand Bargains. Deficits shrink precisely when politicians are least able to do anything grand. Deficits shrink not when leaders compromise, but when they squabble. Right now, the deficit is shrinking at the fastest pace since the end of World War II. Much of this improvement can be explained by economic recovery; much, but not all. And that part of deficit reduction explained by public policy has been put in place (and will likely continue for at least the next two years) by political conflict, not by deal-making. The Bush tax cuts expired at the end of 2012, as did the payroll tax holiday put in place to counter the 2009 recession. Obamacare's new taxes on high-income earners went into effect the very next day. These tax increases enrage Republicans. Yet until and unless Republicans can elect a president to sign a tax cut passed by Congress, the tax increases will remain in effect, collecting rising revenues for the government in Washington. To end the debt ceiling fight in 2011, the parties agreed to an emergency measure -- a budget sequester that mindlessly imposes spending cuts across the federal discretionary budget. The hope was that the sheer irrationality of the sequester would force the parties to agree on a more sensible plan. So much for that. The sequester continues to hack away -- and as things stand, will continue to hack away for the remainder of the decade. Health care cost inflation is slowing down, for reasons economists don't fully understand. Is the slowdown a rare positive effect of the Great Recession? Is Obamacare delivering as promised? Or is it just a manifestation of the old rule that nothing continues forever? Whatever the explanation, that explanation is likely to remain in force for some time to come. Obamacare can't be repealed, can't be expanded, and can't be fixed. Whatever Obamacare does, it's going to keep doing it for a long time to come. A friendly foreign observer of U.S. politics used to joke: ""It's never over till it's over -- and it's never over."" You could add a PS to that rule: ""And when it's over, it's not because anybody likes the result -- but because so many different people hate it for so many different reasons.""

"(CNN) -- Self-discipline and a bit of synchronicity have turned into best-selling success for author Matthew Quick. The former high school teacher describes writing fiction as taking the chaos that's happening inside him and turning it into something orderly on the page. It's working: He has turned out four best-selling books, including one, ""The Silver Linings Playbook,"" that was made into an Oscar-winning movie. Now Quick is continuing to ride his hot streak with a new novel, ""The Good Luck of Right Now,"" out this month. In ""The Good Luck of Right Now,"" Quick's narrator also turns to writing to make sense of his life. Dementia takes over in the final days of Bartholomew Neil's mother's life, and she starts calling her son Richard. He finds a ""Free Tibet"" form letter signed by actor Richard Gere, and thinking there must be some connection, Bartholomew starts writing awkward, intimate letters to the actor. ""Dear Mr. Richard Gere,"" each chapter of the novel begins. From there, Bartholomew confesses his grief over his mother's death, his insecurities about life on his own and growing doubts over his Catholic faith. Quick's quirky supporting cast includes a heavy-drinking, self-defrocked priest, a redheaded grief counselor with serious boyfriend problems, a foul-mouthed movie theater usher mourning the loss of his cat and the shy woman Bartholomew has a crush on, who he dubs the ""Girlbrarian."" This group of misfits comes together as friends, strengthening their offbeat bond on a whimsical road trip to Canada. Quick recently talked to CNN about his new book and his burgeoning success. The following is an edited transcript. Fast facts . Age: 40 . Hometown: He's originally from Philadelphia, grew up in Oaklyn, New Jersey, and now lives in central Massachusetts. Other titles: ""The Silver Linings Playbook"" and young adult novels, ""Sorta Like a Rock Star,"" ""Boy21"" and ""Forgive Me, Leonard Peacock"" Fun facts: Quick got the nickname ""Q"" from his players when he coached girls' soccer and it stuck with him. For fans of: ""The Catcher in the Rye,"" ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"" ""The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time"" Five questions for Matthew Quick . CNN: What was the spark behind your new novel? Quick: I had thought up the title, ""The Good Luck of Right Now,"" several years ago. I had no idea what it meant or what the book would be about but I thought, ""Someday I'm going to write a book with that title."" Then several years ago ... I remember coming home and my wife said, ""Somebody famous wrote you today,"" and thinking ""Wow,"" then opening the letter and realizing it was a ""Free Tibet"" form letter. I thought about the power of celebrity and the fact there are people who probably believe they're receiving a letter that Richard Gere personally signed himself. Then, in the wake of all the promotion I did for ""Silver Linings,"" I found myself in this position where I had dreamed about being ... and then suddenly I'm in a hotel room sitting on a couch with David O. Russell doing interviews or I'm standing backstage at the Katie Couric show, chatting with Bradley Cooper. While it was wonderful and I'm very grateful for those experiences, there are times when the former kid from a blue-collar neighborhood with a working-class background kept saying, ""How did you get here?"" To be honest with you, that kept me up at night. So when I started to write ""The Good Luck of Right Now,"" I wanted to approach some of life's bigger questions, but I wanted to do it in a way that would take me back to a time when I could look at things a little more simply. CNN: Your characters deal with mental health issues, you've also battled depression yourself. Is writing a way for you to deal with that? Quick: When I wrote ""Silver Linings,"" I thought I was writing a book about the Philadelphia Eagles and male bonding, but when the book came out, it was surprising to me that the mental health community embraced it. The mental health conversation is very important to me. I have friends that struggle with various mental illnesses. I've struggled with depression and anxiety. I'm very interested in how we deal with that. The problem with the stigma around mental health is really about the stories that we tell ourselves as a society. What is normal? That's just a story that we tell ourselves. CNN: Synchronicity is a concept that comes up in your new novel. Have you noticed examples of it in your own life? Quick: I'm not an expert, but I'm fascinated by the concept. Writing ""The Good Luck of Right Now,"" synchronicity just abounded. In little things, such as in the novel, the characters go on a road trip and I just arbitrarily picked the car that they rented would be a Ford Focus. After I finished writing the novel, my wife suggested we take the same road trip to do research and add details. So we rented a car and at the rental place I said, ""Give me an economy car, I don't care which model, any one will do."" About five minutes later they come back and say ""Mr. Quick, here's your Ford Focus."" My wife and I just looked at each other and started laughing.

"(CNN) -- When thousands of people converged on Madison, Wisconsin, for the Reclaim Wisconsin March this year in protest of Gov. Scott Walker, Jim Jorstad was there. Standing amongst the thousands of people at the state Capitol, Jorstad, director of technology at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse, documented the historic moment and shared it with the world through the Internet. As the Arab Spring swept through Egypt in 2011, Ahmed Raafat of Cairo captured the people demonstrating in Tahrir Square with his Nikon and uploaded his videos and photographs online for the world to see. Cynthia Falardeau of Vero Beach, Florida, was part of a personal revolution. Falardeau is an advocate for her son, who has special needs. The Internet became a place for her to meet and share her experiences with parents who are in a similar situation. Through her online presence, she was able to bring support and awareness to parents of special-needs children. Although these three iReporters have little in common, they were able to share the stories that surround their lives through technology. The ability to express oneself online has become so important in today's world that the Human Rights Council of the United Nations recently passed a landmark resolution (PDF) about expression over the Internet. In the July 5 resolution, the council states that freedom of expression over the Internet is a basic human right. The U.N. said in the document that it ""recognizes the global and open nature of the Internet as a driving force in accelerating progress."" Even China, where strict censorship of the Internet led Google to end operations in the country, signed off on the resolution. In response to the resolution, CNN asked iReporters to share how the Internet has changed their lives. The responses, which included sharing photos with friends and connecting with family overseas, came from dozens of people around the world. Raafat explained that the Internet allows him to contribute to the revolution in Egypt. ""We didn't have freedom, so the Internet served as a free space where we can express and share our views and opinions freely,"" he said. In his video, Jorstad stands in front of a multimedia presentation, with words such as ""freedom,"" ""explore"" and ""think"" flashing in the background. ""Through the Internet, we can connect with one another,"" he said. ""It's a mechanism to share your content with the world, perhaps inspiring others."" The Internet inspired Kristian Ortiz to share his story about being gay in America. The Virginia Beach resident says that through online forums, he can show people that being gay does not mean he is different from others. ""I just want to show people we are normal,"" he said. John Mollison uses technology to give a voice to combat veterans. The artist and historian interviews veterans who were pilots in World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War, and then he draws their aircraft and shares their stories through his website. ""A lot of these 'old guys' have turned into the grandfathers I never had,"" he said. ""Without the Internet, these stories would likely be locked up in memories or relegated to the geek aisle of a bookstore."" For many, the Internet is not only a place to share stories but to make a living. That's the case of Veronica Mendoza of San Juan City, Philippines. She transformed her presence on the Internet into a classroom, helping students like a group of hearing-impaired Filipino children create multimedia videos. ""I'm earning a living and doing all the things I love through the Internet,"" she said. Beth Alice Barret also found a career online. The New Yorker was part of the dotcom boom, creating an online presence with her site. ""The rapid growth of the Internet ... is exhilarating. It's a chance to express and promote a dream, an idea -- a career,"" she said. ""I'm excited to be a part of a new world."" It is the hope and promise of the Internet that inspires Omekongo Dibinga to connect with other people who aspire for global peace. The Washington resident works specifically in the area of genocide prevention in Central Africa, and through his work online, he is able to connect with people -- or, as he describes them in his video, peacemakers -- who care about bettering the world as well. ""The Internet has shown me that more people are committed to ending atrocities in places like the Congo than just my colleagues,"" Dibinga said. For some, the Internet is a place of familiarity. Hannah Jones of Dallas, a former contestant on ""America's Next Top Model,"" says that at the age of 8, she started playing games on the Internet. ""In the fourth grade, I remember caring for my virtual pet,"" the 21-year-old said. She hopes that people continue to respect the Internet as more and more people across the world gain access to the Web. ""It is the most valuable resource for information and communication,"" she said. ""It is a neutral space for us to resolve issues and concerns throughout the planet as one united force."" But perhaps the most common response from iReporters was that the Internet allows them to more easily connect with faraway people and places. Although Niena Sevilla lives and works in Saudi Arabia, she is able to stay in touch with her children who live in the Philippines. ""I am inspired by the way the Internet has impacted me in terms of my career and my personal life,"" she said. Jerry C. Gonzales agrees. As an immigrant in New Zealand, he finds that the Internet can help ease the pain of homesickness. And Nyasha Chikwekwete of Alexandria, Virginia, can connect with her family in Zimbabwe. You never have to feel lonely on the Internet, she said. ""You can always connect to someone,"" she said. Many iReporters added that it was not just the connection to people but places as well that made the Internet so powerful. Trevor Dougherty of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, used social media to help him travel to Japan. He says the conversations and connections he has made through sites like Twitter and Facebook vastly affected his life, inspiring him to become a world traveler. ""Although the Internet has some weird and unfortunate aspects, it is largely a vehicle for all kinds of creative communication and collaboration. I think we should do everything we can to keep it open and free to use for everyone,"" he said. Despite the varying ways the Internet has changed people's lives, almost everyone who participated in the CNN iReport assignment said it was the instantaneousness that made all other aspects of it possible. ""You are just a click away,"" Chikwekwete said. ""If you have never been to a place you want to go to, you can just Google it and virtually be there.""","U.N. council says freedom of expression over the Internet is a human right .

"Washington (CNN) -- A U.S. Foreign Service officer has been charged in a visa fraud conspiracy in which Vietnamese citizens paid between $20,000 and $70,000 per visa, according to court documents . Michael Todd Sestak, 41, appeared in federal court in Washington Tuesday and will remain in jail pending further court proceedings. He is charged wtih conspiracy to commit bribery and visa fraud. Sestak was visa chief at the U.S. Consulate in Ho Chi Minh City and allegedly started to approve visas for a fee beginning in March 2012. Sestak allegedly worked with co-conspirators who advertised visas for people who were unable to get them on their own or had been turned down. They also encouraged people to enter the United States on tourist visas, overstay the visas and remain in the U.S., according to prosecutors. Sestak allegedly received several million dollars in bribes for approving visas he knew were based on fraudulent information. According to a court affidavit, he moved his money out of Vietnam using money launderers and off-shore banks, and then bought real estate in Phuket and Bangkok, Thailand. In July 2012 the U.S. Consulate received a letter from a confidential source saying there was a visa conspiracy going on. The tipster said from late May until early July 2012 some 50 to 70 people from one Vietnamese village had obtained visas in the scheme. Prosecutors said ultimately hundreds of bad visas were granted. Sestak was arrested in California on May 13. Two women also have been charged in the alleged conspiracy and are in custody in the United States. They are Hong Vo, a 27-year old American citizen, and Truc Tranh Huynh, a 29-year old Vietnamese citizen. The State Department, which controls the Foreign Service, had no comment on the Sestak case. CNN's message to Sestak's lawyer was not immediately returned .","The defendant was visa chief at a U.S. consulate in Vietnam .

"(CNN) -- Officials call the attack ""massive and unprecedented."" At least 65 suspected terrorists killed. Assaults from both the ground and the sky. And elite, clandestine U.S. forces joining Yemeni commandos in targeting al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula -- considered the global terror group's most dangerous affiliate. But what would make the raid in southern Yemen most significant is if it yielded a target who Americans and Yemenis have been looking for: Ibrahim al-Asiri, the group's chief bomb maker. While U.S. officials said the operation didn't directly target him, al-Asiri is among those suspected to have been killed in the Sunday firefight, a high-level Yemeni government official told CNN. According to two Saudi government officials, authorities have taken at least one body to Saudi Arabia for DNA testing. It is that of a Saudi-born militant from al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, officials said, declining to say whether they believe it's al-Asiri. DNA test results are not due for several days. Who is al-Asiri? Al-Asiri is the alleged mastermind of al Qaeda's most creative and disturbing explosive devices. Alleged plots tied to him -- the so-called underwear bomber aboard a U.S.-bound jetliner in 2009 and printer bombs dispatched to America the next year aboard cargo planes -- almost worked. He even sacrificed his younger brother, a suicide bomber, in a failed attempt to kill Saudi Arabia's head of counterterrorism in 2009. Al-Asiri constructed a bomb like none al Qaeda had produced before: a device designed to be inserted into the rectum of a suicide bomber containing around 100 grams of PETN, a difficult-to-detect white powdery explosive. Only his brother was killed. Official: Extensive U.S. involvement in anti-terror operation in Yemen . What led up to this raid? A video and a threat. A recently released video showed about 100 suspected al Qaeda members meeting at a training camp in Yemen. In the middle of the video, the man known as al Qaeda's crown prince, Nasir al-Wuhayshi, appears brazenly out in the open, greeting followers. Al-Wuhayshi is the No. 2 leader of al Qaeda globally and the head of AQAP. In a speech to the group, he makes it clear that he's going after the United States, saying: ""We must eliminate the cross. ... The bearer of the cross is America!"" Retired U.S. Gen. Richard Myers said the video raised serious concerns. ""If that's true, then you have to go after them,"" Myers told CNN's ""The Situation Room."" ""I don't think that's sufficient in the end to defeat al Qaeda, but I think it's important that we go after them in this case."" What role did the U.S. play? A U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said no Americans took part in combat on the ground, but U.S. forces did wear night vision gear and flew Yemeni forces to a remote, mountainous spot in southern Yemen. The Yemeni helicopters that the U.S. personnel flew were Russian-made, which helped to minimize the American footprint during the operation. And CIA drones are suspected to have targeted al Qaeda fighters, weapons locations and a training camp. Pentagon spokesman Adm. John Kirby declined to detail the U.S. involvement in the operation, though he did highlight the partnership with Yemen. ""We continue to work with the Yemeni government and the Yemeni armed forces to help them improve their counterterrorism capabilities inside the country,"" Kirby said. ""That work continues, and it will continue."" Yemen strikes may target top al Qaeda leaders . Opinion: Obama's high-stakes drone war in Yemen .

"(CNN) -- An Ecuadorian appeals court upheld an $8.6 billion ruling against oil giant Chevron stemming from claims that the company had a detrimental impact on Amazonian communities where it operated. The judgment against Chevron is the latest in 19 years of litigation between Amazon residents and Texaco, which was later purchased by Chevron. A three-judge panel handed down the ruling Tuesday, nearly a year after receiving the case, the state-run Andes news agency reported. In addition, the appeals court ruled that Chevron must publicly apologize to Ecuador, and if it fails to do so, the fine will be doubled to nearly $18 billion, Andes reported. In a statement, Chevron said the appeals court ruling ""is another glaring example of the politicization and corruption of Ecuador's judiciary that has plagued this fraudulent case from the start."" The company alleges that reports and evidence against it were fraudulent, and that bribes and corruption led to the original decision against it. ""Chevron does not believe that the Ecuador ruling is enforceable in any court that observes the rule of law. The company will continue to seek to hold accountable the perpetrators of this fraud,"" the company said in a statement. When an Ecuadorian court handed down the original ruling last year, both Chevron and the Amazonian residents appealed. Chevron argued the verdict was the product of fraud and the plaintiffs said the size of the award was too small in comparison to what would be needed to do a real clean-up. The case, Aguinda v. ChevronTexaco, was originally filed in New York in 1993 on behalf of 30,000 inhabitants of Ecuador's Amazon region. The suit was eventually transferred to the Ecuadorian court and Ecuadorian jurisdiction. The lawsuit alleges that Texaco used a variety of substandard production practices in Ecuador that resulted in pollution that decimated several indigenous groups in the area, according to a fact sheet provided by the Amazon Defense Coalition. According to the group, Texaco dumped more than 18 billion gallons of toxic waste into Amazon waterways, abandoned more than 900 waste pits, burned millions of cubic meters of gases with no controls and spilled more than 17 million gallons of oil due to pipeline ruptures. Cancer and other health problems were reported at higher rates in the area, the group says. Chevron says Texaco was partnered with an Ecuadorian oil company when it operated in Ecuador, and that it spent $40 million on remediation efforts to clean up roughly one-third of the sites in which it worked -- an amount reflective of its 37% share of the oil-producing consortium with Petroecuador. It says its cleanup efforts were certified and approved by the Ecuardorian government and blames Petroecuador for any ongoing pollution at sites where it was the sole operator, according to documents on the Chevron website regarding the lawsuit and its history of operations in the South American country.","An Ecuadorian appeals court upheld the ruling against Chevron .
The fine will double if Chevron does not apologize .

"Simferopol, Crimea (CNN) -- Money, time zones, flags, water, ships: just a few of the issues to deal with when you divorce one country and prepare to join another. The pro-Russian leadership of Crimea is now issuing declarations on an almost hourly basis about the practical consequences of joining the Russian Federation, even as much of the rest of the world says the whole process is illegal. Their biggest headache is geographical: Crimea has no land border with Russia. The closest link is a windswept ferry crossing in the far north-eastern corner of Crimea that connects Kerch with the Russian mainland. The town's mayor told CNN last week that a bridge will be built across the 4.5-kilometer wide Strait of Kerch to mother Russia, as promised by Russian Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev, but that's a multi-year project. Then there are other challenges. Military . There are still thousands of Ukrainian troops based in Crimea, and for many of them it is home. Their fate is far from clear. The new Crimean authorities say they can stay in uniform if they swear allegiance to Crimea, or leave. Those wishing to ""return"" to Ukraine would be given safe passage, without their weapons. The Ukrainian government continues to insist the bases will not be evacuated. Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Vitaliy Yarema said Monday that ""if the Crimean authorities try to force the Ukrainian military out, the Ukrainian military has the right to use force."" For now there is a stand-off, with the Ukrainians saying that -- for several days at least -- an agreement has been reached that allows supplies to reach the troops still holed up in bases and surrounded by Russian troops. There's been no word from Moscow on this. The new Crimean government says it intends to take over Ukrainian naval vessels currently in Crimean waters. Some have been blockaded in a lake after several old Russian ships were scuttled. But most of the Ukrainian navy is in poor shape and would not be much of an asset. In fact, the Ukrainians admitted this month that only four navy ships were battle-ready, and the fleet's commander has already switched allegiance. Money . Currently ATMs in Crimea still dispense hryvnia, the Ukrainian currency. The ruble is little used in Crimea and money-changers would rather have your euros or dollars. Crimea plans to have its own central bank, tied closely to that of Russia, and adopt the ruble as the official currency in April. In practical terms, it's likely that some banks in Crimea will start working in rubles while others -- for the time-being -- will use the hryvnia. The new Crimean leader, Sergei Aksyonov, says he expects Crimea to be a dual-currency state for a while, and the regional parliament voted Monday to allow the hryvnia to remain an official currency until 2016. For its part, Ukraine's central bank has no plans to starve Crimea of currency, because it could wipe out the savings of Ukrainians living in Crimea, according to a bank official who spoke to CNN's Nina dos Santos on Monday. The Russian Deputy Finance Minister, Sergei Shatalov, has floated the idea of a special tax regime for Crimea while the new authorities adapt laws and tax regulations to conform with those of Russia and businesses and properties are re-registered. But Crimea will also need an infusion of Russian cash, especially if Western sanctions extend beyond visa restrictions and asset freezes for a few prominent individuals and start impacting businesses in Crimea. In the past the region has received hefty subsidies from the Ukrainian government as one of the poorer parts of the country. The average wage in Crimea is $240 a month, far lower than that of Russia, according to data from the Ukrainian State Statistics Committee. Analysts say Russia may have to pump from $1 to $3 billion each year into the Crimean government's budget if pensions and other benefits are to be raised to Russian levels - at a time when several other Russian regions are close to insolvent. Water and power . Between 80 and 90% of Crimea's water comes from Ukraine. A canal brings water supplies from the Dnieper River across the Isthmus of Perekop and into the Crimean peninsula. With warm, dry summers and low rainfall (15 inches a year), Crimea needs that water to irrigate its arable land. Ukraine says it has no intention of cutting off water supplies, perhaps because it in turn relies on Russia as a source of natural gas (and owes Russian provider Gazprom $2 billion on that debt). To cut off Crimea's water would look like a vindictive and indiscriminate gesture from a country desperate for western support. Russia could build a water pipeline under the Kerch Strait into Crimea, using water from the Kuban River, but it would be an expensive long-term project. Two-thirds of the peninsula's gas supplies come from the Ukrainian state-owned supplier Chernomorneftegaz. Crimea's coal-fired power plants supply only one-tenth of the electricity it needs. The rest comes from Ukraine. If Russia had to supply Crimea with most of its power needs, pipelines and pylons would have to be built. Which leads us to.... Energy resources . On Monday, the Crimean parliament passed a resolution to seize the assets in Crimea of two Ukrainian energy producers. One is the state-owned Chernomorneftegaz, which has drilling rigs off Crimea's west coast and in the Sea of Azov. The parliament's resolution said the takeover would include ownership of the region's ""continental shelf and the exclusive (maritime) economic zone."" This could be very problematic. While a land border would look relatively straightforward (even if rejected by Kiev), disputes on maritime boundaries would not, as Crimea's coastline is dotted by islands and spits of land. The Black and Azov Seas are estimated to hold nearly 60 trillion cubic feet of gas. Several offshore fields being developed are close to both Crimea and the Ukrainian mainland and may become a flashpoint as the crisis evolves. On Tuesday, the Ukrainian Justice Minister, Pavlo Petrenko, described the attempted confiscation of Ukrainian assets as ""an act of thievery made by those people who are part of the pseudo-Crimean government."" While losing a few railway locomotives is bearable when you are virtually bankrupt, losing oil and gas revenues is not. The crisis may also deter western oil companies from investing in exploration. Exxon has already put on hold its pursuit of one block. None will want to be associated with a government the U.S. and European Union has declared illegitimate. Flags . Already lowered and raised. The vivid blue and yellow of Ukraine is gone (though police cars will need repainting). Now the Russian and Crimean flags flutter side-by-side: both red, white and blue, but slightly different. Time zones . The new leadership in Crimea has already announced that on March 30 it will align the republic with Moscow time -- two hours ahead of Ukraine's in winter months. This would mean dark mornings in Simferopol. On New Year's Day, the sun rises at 7:22am in Simferopol. In the new time-zone it would rise at 9:22am. Food . Wander round a supermarket in Simferopol and it's soon apparent that most foodstuffs and household goods are coming from, or through, Ukraine. The profit motive and consumer demand may be enough to ensure this flow continues, but much depends on whether the new border hastily being drawn across northern Crimea becomes a regular European crossing or a grim reminder of the frontier that once divided the continent. The port of Sevastopol provides Crimea with an alternative but likely more expensive import-export hub. Its facilities are badly in need of modernization, but a $10 billion investment plan proposed by a Chinese tycoon may be disrupted by the current turmoil and/or sanctions. The future? There have been orderly separations and divisions in the past, most notably that of the Czech Republic and Slovakia in 1993, dubbed the Velvet Divorce. But that was painstakingly prepared with guidance from international experts. Crimea's rupture from Ukraine has been more sudden. Integration with all things Russian will take much longer, and cost much more, than the rapid political process playing out in Moscow. CNN's Nina dos Santos and journalist Victoria Butenko contributed to this report.","There are issues when you divorce one country and join another, writes CNN's Tim Lister .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Roland Marbaugh wrote 509 pages of his tales of war -- from the swampy Solomon Islands in World War II to the frozen Chosin Reservoir in Korea. His son typed them all up on an electric typewriter in the 1980s but unpublished, Marbaugh's stories remained largely in his mind. Until now. Marbaugh's story will soon be among 600 others on Witness to War, a virtual library of Americans in combat. When his testimony is posted in a few days, viewers will be able to hear the former Marine captain, now a spry 91, recount harrowing tales with photographic precision. Some things never dulled in Marbaugh's memory. Like how fellow Marine ""Wee Willie Wilson"" killed 19 Japanese in their foxholes on the Pacific island of Bougainville and was awarded a prestigious Naval Cross for his ""valiant fighting spirit."" ""He had 20 rounds of ammunition; killed 19 Japanese. Willy was a show-off,"" Marbaugh said of his fellow Marine. ""We don't know how he got in their bunker. He never told me."" Marbaugh might have never gotten a chance to recount his stories had it not been for Atlanta entrepreneur Tom Beaty, the founder of Witness to War. Beaty's own interest in combat tales developed rather unusually. He didn't come from a military family. Nor did he grow up like Marbaugh's children, listening to war stories from daddy. He didn't even like history lessons in school, in which he learned about the sweeping nature of war -- dates and names, but nothing that gave a boy a clear idea of what it was like to be there. Then, when he was 11, Beaty's mother gave him a pictorial history of World War II. He flipped through the pages and stared at each photograph. What was it like to be there? What did war smell like? How did it feel to be wounded or watch someone die? He earned a degree in military history at the University of North Carolina and more than anything, he wanted other Americans to appreciate the view from the foxhole as much as he did. Later in Atlanta, he began attending World War II roundtable meetings. Someone, he realized, needed to capture the veterans' stories for posterity. He bought a camera and recording equipment and launched Witness to War in 2002. Outside of his business consulting job, Beaty spent his own money and time interviewing soldiers, Marines, sailors and airmen. It was a labor of love and a project that married his personal interest with a desire to give back to those who had sacrificed. War at Home: A soldier's war on two fronts . Today, it's a searchable archive of 600 such accounts. Beaty hopes to grow the virtual library by at least a thousand more tales in two years. Eventually, he'd like to see it all in the Library of Congress. He knows he's racing against time with World War II veterans, many in their 90s, like Marbaugh, or even older. They are dying off at the rate of 1,000 per day, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs, and taking their stories to cold graves. ""Every time a veteran dies, a library burns,"" Beaty said in his suburban Atlanta office. ""What I learned in high school was the high-level view of things, not the horror of delivering freedom,"" he said. ""Our mission is simple -- to preserve, honor and educate."" Imagine, he said, if the stories of Revolutionary War or Civil War veterans had been captured on video. Beaty used to do all the interviews himself. Now he has an assistant and hopes one day to be able to deploy a team of interviewers to record veterans' stories. He has interviewed Medal of Honor recipients whose experiences are well known. But it's those who have rarely spoken who interest Beaty the most. And sometimes, it's his curiosity that leads him to them. When Beaty was visiting his father's grave in Union County, North Carolina, he noticed a dual grave with two headstones. The father had passed away, but there was only a birth date for the son. It was an unusual name: Arch de Castrique. Beaty looked up de Castrique and ended up eating breakfast at McDonald's with him, listening to stories about Japanese soldiers and their combat tactics and agreed to tell them on camera. Shortly afterwards, de Castrique developed Alzheimer's and could no longer recall his experiences. Eventually, the disease took his life. But his story lives on because of Beaty's project. Sometimes, the interviews are emotional, filled with painful pauses and tears. Others are cathartic, as it was for Glenn Gooch, who fought with the 4th Infantry in World War II. Gooch told Beaty how he had come across dead Americans during his first combat experience in France, some with their throats slit. It was meant to scare the living. Or another time, when he fired his M1 rifle at a German soldier close up in the dark. ""I can see it just as plain today as I did that night. Shooting at him so much until his body, his hips, in that area, looked like it was on fire."" All the while Gooch speaks, his eyes never meet Beaty's camera. It was the first time he had talked about his combat memories publicly. Beaty is constantly on a search for more stories. He contacted Marbaugh after he read an account of the 17 days of brutal battle in North Korea's Chosin Reservoir on its 60th anniversary. The Marines were encircled by Chinese troops. They fought for their lives. Beaty said he was struck by the accounts of hand-to-hand combat with Chinese troops. Marbaugh said many of his fellow Marines froze to death as they were forced to retreat south. When the Chinese charged down a hill, he gave the orders: a bayonet or a bullet. ""We had to do what we had to do,"" he said. ""Not too proud of it."" Marbaugh, then a captain, started off with 500 men under him. After Chosin, he was left with 75. The temperatures fell to 16 below. The dead were covered up and left to freeze. Marbaugh said ""Tootsie Rolls"" was the code name for ammunition. But somebody who loaded up the ammo for airdrops thought the Marines wanted candy. So with every case of ammo came the sweet stuff. ""You could do nothing with food or water,"" he said, referring to the frigid weather. ""But you could put a Tootsie Roll under your arm. It would get warm and soft."" Marbaugh also told Beaty a harrowing tale of napalm, when there were hundreds of Chinese soldiers coming their way and the Air Force stepped in to save the surrounded Marines. There were four planes -- one to spot and three to attack. ""The second plane dropped his napalm but not the third or fourth. At the same time Marines from all sides opened up with mortars and heavy machine guns. ""Why didn't you drop?"" the second pilot asked the others. ""There was no target left,"" they replied. ""We had massacred them,"" Marbaugh said. Marbaugh was honored to be able to share his stories. ""I'm glad they picked me,"" he said. Beaty looked at Marbaugh and his son and thought about all the lifelines that were stopped by war, all the families that never were because a man died on the battlefield. He said he felt a need to make the connection between the sacrifices that were made and the freedoms that Americans enjoy. He was thankful for men like Marbaugh, who survived to tell. They were warriors who became walking libraries.","Tom Beaty founded Witness to War in 2002 .

"(CareerBuilder.com) -- People are losing their jobs left and right these days, and it's not because of the economy. It's because of what they say. President Obama relieved Gen. Stanley McChrystal of his job as commander of all U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan Wednesday, because of negative remarks the general and his aides made about several officials in the Obama administration that were published in a Rolling Stone magazine article. The comments made were pretty clear that the general did not agree with many of the policies and decisions made about the war in Afghanistan. McChrystal isn't the first U.S. general to be sacked by a commander-in-chief. George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and Harry Truman are among those who have done the same during wartime. In a statement, Obama gave his reasons for the decision: . ""The conduct represented in the recently published article does not meet the standard that should be set by a commanding general. It undermines the civilian control of the military that is at the core of our democratic system. And it erodes the trust that's necessary for our team to work together to achieve our objectives in Afghanistan."" While not everyone is going to be the subject of Rolling Stone feature, more and more people are airing their grievances bosses to the public via Facebook, Twitter and texting ... and getting in trouble for them. For every story you see in the newspaper about this issue, I bet there are many more that aren't reported. Just this week, a friend told me she might have to let an employee go based on a Facebook post. So can you disagree with your boss without losing your job? Yes, but it's how you do it that can make or break your employment. Most importantly, you should do is address the issue directly with your boss in a respectful manner. Joseph Grenny, coauthor of ""Crucial Confrontations,"" gives some tips on how to do this. 1. Get your motives right. Sometimes we wait to bring up concerns until we're irritated. This is ineffective because at that point our goal is no longer to be constructive, it's to punish. Before opening your mouth, ask yourself, ""What do I really want?"" 2. Start with safety. Begin by clarifying your respect and your intent. Help your boss understand that your intent is to provide a different viewpoint you feel will help achieve your mutual goal. 3. Start with the facts. Once you've created safety, you start describing your concerns facts first. Don't lead with your judgments or conclusions. Start by describing in non-judgmental and objective terms the behaviors that are creating problems. 4. Don't pile on. As you lay out the facts, monitor safety. If your boss becomes defensive, pause for a moment and check in. Reassure them of your positive intentions and allow them to express any concerns they have. 5. Invite dialogue. Finally, having shared your concerns, encourage your boss to share their perspective. Invite dialogue. The result of your openness will be a greater openness on your boss's part as well. &copy CareerBuilder.com 2011. All rights reserved.

"(CNN) -- So this is Christmas. A coquettish Santa Claus, rocking a sexy version of his traditional red suit while doing his best Marilyn Monroe ""Seven Year Itch"" pose. The wide-mouthed blowup doll was erected outside a mall in Taiyuan, the capital of China's northern Shanxi province, to appeal to shoppers and tourists. Santa Monroe's face, like some other displays around the world, isn't entirely what the holiday season is all about and certainly rather extreme. China isn't Germany, for example -- a country in which you'd expect to find yourself caught up in the Christmas spirit. But not unlike other parts of the world, every November many shopping malls, hotels, restaurants and other commercial venues across China coat themselves in a sugary sweet layer of beautiful and occasionally unusual trees, festive light displays and other holiday kitsch. And they can come by the decorations cheap thanks to the Chinese city of Yiwu, often called ""The Christmas Capital of the World"" for the high number of factories producing holiday decorations that are exported globally. Though there are reports Christianity is on the rise in China, it wouldn't be accurate to say most ordinary Chinese equate Christmas with religion or the celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ. It's not a public holiday in China so all businesses and schools remain open on December 25. That hasn't stopped many locals from buying into the gift giving and party traditions of the season. It's a trend retail outlets are more than happy to cater to, piping Christmas music through speakers and laying on the tinsel to get shoppers in the mood to spend. If you really want to enjoy the season, there's no Christmas theme but China's most wintery attraction is the annual Harbin Ice and Snow Sculpture Festival. Though it doesn't officially kick off until January 5, many of the displays go up in mid-December and are open for visitors.","Santa Claus doll outside China shopping mall imitates Marilyn Monroe's famous ""Seven Year Itch"" pose .

"(CNN) -- Colleen Whiteaker's three eldest daughters looked at her with concern. They were beautiful, she thought, with their slim, athletic builds and porcelain skin. She hadn't wanted them to deal with the pain of being overweight, so she had taught them to eat nutritious foods and stay active. Now they were throwing those lessons back in her face. Miriam, Candace and Chloe tried to pitch their ""intervention"" like a fun plan. They bought their mom a gym membership and some new workout clothes. They tried to avoid talking about her weight problem directly, but eventually the truth came out. ""It was terrible,"" Candace remembers. ""It's never something you want to bring up, especially to your mom. But really it was just hurting us to see her like that. We didn't want to have to worry about her dying."" Their mother was 5 feet 2 inches tall and weighed more than 200 pounds. She had become isolated and never wanted to participate in family get-togethers. The older girls were worried their youngest sister Celeste, 5 at the time, wouldn't get to know the wonderful, energetic mom with whom they had grown up. ""They were crying. I was crying,"" Colleen says. ""It really hurt my feelings. ... I was like, 'I know I'm heavy. I know that, but I'm not unhealthy. I'm just supposed to be that weight.' ""They were like, 'Mom, I don't think that's true.' "" 'I was trying to lose weight' Colleen isn't sure how she put on so much weight. She was chubby as a child, and her weight fluctuated throughout adulthood. She didn't eat a lot of bad foods, staying away from fast food and fried fare. But she rarely exercised and says she has a slow metabolism. Shortly after Celeste's birth, Colleen and her husband divorced. Stress, combined with an unusual work schedule and a new baby, kept the pounds on despite multiple attempts at dieting. ""It was discouraging because I wasn't just pretending like I didn't know I needed to lose weight,"" she says. ""I was trying to lose weight. I wanted something to change."" Unfortunately, her daughters' intervention didn't work. It wasn't until Chloe and Candace's college graduation nearly six years later that she really took a good look in the mirror. She was thrilled for her daughters and proud to be their mother, but she wasn't proud of the way she looked. She weighed close to 230 pounds. She dreaded meeting their college friends and taking a million photos. On the way home -- embarrassed and miserable -- Colleen thought about what she could do. A few years earlier, her new husband had bought a Bowflex TreadClimber. It was sitting in their North Carolina house, practically unused. She promised herself she would start walking on it three times a week, for 20 minutes. And that's what she did. At the end of September 2011, she met her daughters at Kings Dominion, an amusement park in Virginia, for an annual trip. The girls noticed she had lost a bit of weight and complimented her. ""I was excited, but I didn't really want to ... make a huge deal of it because I didn't want her to feel like we were adding pressure,"" Candace says. The girls' comments encouraged Colleen. She added another day to her routine, then another. Soon she was walking for 45 minutes, six days a week. The more she exercised, the more she was conscious of what she was eating. She started writing down her meals in a journal to get an idea of how much she was consuming each day. Her goal was to go from a size 20 to a size 12. By May 2012, she was a size 2/4. She had lost more than 110 pounds in about 10 months. ""She was ready to take on the world,"" Candace says. ""She wanted to go out and do all these things. ... It was like having our old mom back."" Have you lost weight? Share your story on iReport . Raiding daughters' closets fun . When she was overweight, Colleen says she never felt bad physically. ""I did whatever I wanted to do, but I didn't want to do that much,"" she says with a laugh. Today she says she feels ""100% better."" ""She has more energy than we do now,"" Candace says. ""She's just very inspiring, and she just keeps going, and I love her for that."" Colleen was laid off before she jumped on the TreadClimber. She went on multiple job interviews that amounted to nothing. But her first interview after losing the weight resulted in a job offer. She's not sure if it was her new body or her newfound confidence, but she knows people treat her differently now that she's slim. ""They see you as maybe having something to offer,"" she says. Perhaps her favorite part of losing weight is borrowing her daughters' clothes. Before, she hated to go shopping to buy new clothes. Now when she visits, she doesn't even bother to pack -- instead preferring to raid their closets. Celeste just turned 13, and Candace is happy her youngest sister will get to experience Colleen as the mom she remembers. ""She's very free-spirited and encouraging and happy,"" Candace says of her mother. ""And that was being covered up by all that extra weight she was carrying around.""

"(CNN) -- A jury in Georgia found a man guilty of homicide by vessel in the death of singer Usher Raymond's former stepson. Kile Glover, 11, and a 15-year-old girl were riding on an inner tube that was being pulled by a pontoon boat on a Georgia lake when a personal watercraft hit them in July 2012, according to witnesses. Jeffrey Simon Hubbard, a 40-year-old Atlanta man, was operating the personal watercraft, investigators said. He was a family friend who was part of their group outing on Lake Lanier north of Atlanta. A Hall County, Georgia, jury Thursday found Hubbard guilty on five counts including homicide by vessel in the first degree, serious injury by vessel, reckless operation of a vessel, unlawful operation of a personal watercraft, and a boat traffic violation. Sentencing is set for next month. Kile suffered a serious head injury and died two weeks later at Children's Healthcare at Egleston in Atlanta. The boy's mother, Tameka Raymond, was married to Usher for two years. They have two children together from their marriage. They divorced in 2009. Kile's father is Ryan Glover, the president of Bounce TV, a fledgling television network targeting African-American audiences. He is also a former executive with Turner Broadcasting, the parent company of CNN. CNN's Suzanne Presto contributed to this report.","Kile Glover, 11, was riding on an inner tube hit by a personal watercraft .

"(CNN) -- A California man was arrested on terror charges early Monday morning near the Canadian border, according to the Department of Justice. In a press release issued Monday, the DOJ said 20-year-old Nicholas Teausant was arrested in Blaine, Washington, and was charged with attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. According to the release, Teausant traveled to the Canadian border with the intent of continuing on to Syria to join the terrorist organization known as al Qaeda in Iraq. On Teausant's Facebook page, he goes by a second, Arabic, name, Ased abdur-Raheem. According to the criminal complaint filed by the FBI, Teausant is a student at a community college in Stockton, California, and is a member of the U.S. Army National Guard, though he is in the process of being released by the Guard for not meeting the minimum qualifications. The arrest and charging of Teausant are the result of a joint investigation between the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Modesto, California, Police Department, along with the San Joaquin Sheriff's Office and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, according to the DOJ. According to the FBI's affidavit, Teausant used Instagram and other social media sites to connect with Islamic extremists and to express his desire to conduct violent jihad and ""to be a part of America's 'downfall'"" In one communication, Teausant detailed his ideas to bomb several public places in the United States, including the day care his infant daughter attends, calling it a ""Zionist reform church."" Teausant's communications with extremists and undercover FBI agents continued online and in person for about six months, ending in his arrest on Monday. Teausant was expected to make his first court appearance Monday afternoon in Washington. If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

"(CNN) -- A new battle has erupted on the global stage over the future of free speech. Its epicenter moved to the U.N. General Assembly, where world leaders expounded on the great issues of the day. The annual U.N. gathering came just days after a chain reaction of ferocious protests in Muslim countries against a video on YouTube insulting Islam. Reaction to the video led to the deaths, at last count, of more than 50 people, including the U.S. ambassador to Libya, Christopher Stevens. So, the hateful video and the mass violence became an inescapable topic at the United Nations. And yet there was intense disagreement about what exactly was troubling about the events of the last few weeks and what action they demand. In the view of some Arab and Muslim leaders, the time has come to draft new international rules limiting free expression for the sake of preventing insults to religions. The head of the Arab League, Nabil Elaraby, called for ""criminaliz(ing) acts that insult or cause offense to religions."" This move to impose anti-blasphemy laws should come as a call to action for democracy advocates everywhere: Freedom of speech, a most fundamental of human rights, a cornerstone of democracy, has come under international attack. Certainly, non-Muslims living in some of those countries have had nightmarish experiences with them as the bans are used to target minorities and government critics. Among political leaders, however, the idea appears popular. The anti-Islam video itself has apparently caused more anguish than the ensuing killings. Or at least it has seemed politically expedient to create that impression. Afghan President Hamid Karzai, for example, declared, ""The world is shaken by the depravity of fanatics who have committed acts of insult against the faith of over 1.5 billion Muslims. We strongly condemn these offensive acts, whether it involves the production of a film, the publication of cartoons, or indeed any other acts of insult and provocation. Such acts can never be justified as freedom of speech or expression."" The emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, noted he ""firmly"" believes in free expression, explaining, ""freedom should not cross reasonable limits and become a tool to hurt and insult the dignity of others and of religions and faiths and sacred beliefs as we have seen lately, which regrettably led to the killing of innocent people who have not committed any crime."" He thus blamed the film, rather than those who committed the killings. During a time such as this -- when new democracies are taking shape in the Middle East, and people everywhere are giving serious thought to what kind of system, what kind of laws and what kind of societies they want to live in -- the debate could hardly matter more. That's why it was heartening to hear President Barack Obama mount a spirited defense of free expression. Obama staked out a position that is generally accepted in Western democracies, and enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. ""I accept that people are going to call me awful things every day,"" he said, ""and I will always defend their right to do so."" He added, ""Americans have fought and died around the globe to protect the right of all people to express their views -- even views that we profoundly disagree with."" And he made the fundamental argument that ""the strongest weapon against hateful speech is not repression, it is more speech."" The U.S. president's professorial defense of the admittedly complex case for allowing people to say offensive things came as a refreshing change from America's international campaign of contrition for the offending video, which seems less than consistent with its belief in free speech. It is appropriate for American leaders to explain they found the anti-Islam film reprehensible. But additional steps, including the spending of $70,000 in U.S. taxpayers' money for an ad campaign in Pakistan rejecting the video, is a step too far, especially considering that the riots that followed were to a large degree a result of political manipulation. Washington's campaign blurred the basic point and confused America's position. More than anyone, that hurts the efforts of the brave advocates for human rights in Arab and Muslim countries, who have been badly outnumbered and outmaneuvered in the aftermath of the Arab uprisings. Obama's U.N. speech should mark the start of a push for more, not less free speech throughout the world. And every effort to limit it under the guise of defending the feelings of followers of any religion must be met with the strongest possible resistance. It is not coincidental that many of the same countries where large demonstrations erupted in recent weeks are places where religious freedoms do not exist, where Christians have come under attack and Jews are insulted and threatened routinely and without consequence. Muslim states have tried before to push a ""Defamation of Religion"" resolution at the United Nations, just as religious and political leaders, seeking to bolster their popularity, issued fatwas calling for the religiously sanctioned assassination of artists whose work they deemed offensive. Just as the fury over the anti-Islam film raged, the bounty for killing Salman Rushdie, the Indian-born British writer, was boosted to more than $3 million. Rushdie was sentenced to death by Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini in 1989 because the imam deemed one of Rushdie's novels, which surely the ayatollah never read, offensive enough to merit death to the writer. Blasphemy laws exist in a number of countries. One can argue it's their right to enact the laws they see fit -- even though they violate international agreements. But they most decidedly should not be allowed to alter international agreements establishing the right of free expression for all human beings. If Muslims are offended by distorted perceptions of their religion, by all means they should fight back. They should launch a campaign to educate the world about Islam. I believe their campaign would prove greatly successful. The right response to stupidity, prejudice and hatred is shining a light on the truth. That has a way of highlighting the stupidity of the bigots. It may not end all dumb and offensive films, but it will ensure that the people who espouse offensive ideas remain a despised, marginalized and powerless minority. In this new battle on the global stage over the future of free expression, the bigots will only lose if free speech wins.

"(CNN) -- A first-class return ticket from New York to Hong Kong for $43 and four air miles sounds too good to be true. And when Brian Kelly purchased such a fare -- which usually costs about $11,000 -- using United's online ticketing system last week, he knew that's exactly what it was. But he also knew from first-hand experience that ""error fares"" -- rock-bottom fares mistakenly issued by carriers -- can sometimes be recognized as good for travel by airlines. Having booked two fares at rock-bottom prices on the site, Kelly, who runs an advice website for frequent flyers called The Points Guy, alerted his readers to the ""amazing deal"" on his website, encouraging them to take advantage of the offer before United corrected the glitch -- then waited to see if the ticket would be honored. ""Everyone knew this was a mistake -- a huge one. One of the biggest I've seen an airline make,"" he said. Airlines regularly make errors resulting in mispriced fares being issued, sometimes honoring them but often not. ""I've been on a lot of crazy mistake fares in the past that did work out, the airlines did honor them,"" said Kelly, who recounts how he recently flew round trips from New York to Stockholm and Copenhagen on three consecutive weekends for $138 a trip. See also: 'Hidden' airline charges just dirty tricks? Kelly said he was optimistic that although the fares were clearly issued in error, United would be required to honor the tickets following a recent ruling on ""mistake fares"" by the U.S. Department of Transportation. The rule means that a purchase occurs once the customer pays the full amount -- and that once the purchase is confirmed, whether through an email or credit card transaction or other means, ""then the seller of air transportation cannot increase the price of that air transportation to that consumer, even when the fare is a 'mistake.'"" Kelly had received a confirmation email from the airline, suggesting the fare should be valid under the new rules. But United contacted him and others to tell them that the incorrect fares had been issued due to a ""programming error."" Customers who wished to retain the fares would be charged the full amount, or could cancel the purchase and have any fees waived. United spokesman Rahsaan Johnson said it would have been clear that the fare was a mistake as the correct amount was displayed on the same screen. On website Flyertalk, United said the fact that the correct price was displayed was a ""unique circumstance"" unlike ""other widely reported 'mistake fares.'"" However, for customers who had already begun their travel by the time the glitch was detected, the airline would honor their return fares. The airline would not say how many people booked flights for the incorrect price, or how many actually managed to travel on the cheap fares by commencing their travel before United took action. Kelly said although he ""would have liked the airline to have honored"" the fare, he wasn't going to lose any sleep over missing out. But he said it would have provided a good test case for the Department of Transportation. See also: Fliers pay more for window seats . Department of Transportation spokesman Bill Mosley said the department had received 150 complaints from customers who had bought the ""error fares"" and was still determining whether United had violated the rules. ""If we find a carrier violates our rules, we can issue fines and cease-and-desist orders,"" he said. Airline responses to pricing mistakes are unpredictable. In 2010, American Airlines refused to honor first-class return tickets from the U.S. to Australia, worth up to $20,000, it had sold for the coach price of $1,100. But it offered $200 vouchers as compensation. The previous year British Airways also failed to accept $40 flights to India, offering $300 vouchers instead. But in 2008 Swiss International honored some $0 flights booked between Toronto and destinations in Europe and India, while refusing others. Kelly polled his site users and asked them if they thought taking advantage of such mistakes was unethical. While about a quarter thought those who booked the tickets were ""bottom feeders trying to ruin a poor airline,"" he said, the majority was comfortable with opportunistically capitalizing on the mistakes of airlines. What do you think? Would you knowingly book an ""error fare"" with an airline? Or is doing so unethical? Let us know in the comments section below.","A glitch in United's ticketing system made for cheap air fares last week .

"(CNN) -- Off Peru's Pacific coast, thousands of dolphins are being slaughtered to be used solely as shark bait -- despite the practice being outlawed by the South American country. The London-based Ecologist Film Unit recently recorded one of the hunts in an undercover investigation and released its material. On a crisp, sunny day, the group joins a fishing vessel as it goes through rough water riding closer and closer to dusky dolphins swimming under the ship's bow. The crew aims to plunge a harpoon into the pod, assuring it travels all the way through the body of one of the mammals. Bleeding profusely, the dolphin is hauled on board and almost immediately dies on the deck of the vessel. With his sharpened knife, a Peruvian fisherman then peels the skin off the dolphin's back and carefully cuts the severed body into thin slices. Even though dolphin killings have been outlawed by Peru's legislature since 1996, Stefan Austermuhle, executive director of the animal conservation group Mundo Azul, said fishermen have continued to target the mammals. He estimated more than 10,000 dolphins are being killed every year in Peruvian waters. China's white dolphins headed for extinction? Despite the law prohibiting the human consumption and sales of dolphin meat, Mudo Azul asserts there's been weak law enforcement and lack of awareness. ""In recent years, there's been an upsurge in the targeting of sharks. The shark meat is predominantly consumed within Peru, but the fins we're told are being exported to the Far East for use as shark fin soup,"" said Jim Wickens, an investigative journalist with the Ecologist Film Unit. He witnessed the scene along with cameraman Alexander Reynoso who recorded the harpooning of the dolphins. Wickens, in cooperation with the Pulitzer Center for Crisis Reporting, collaborated with Mundo Azul to conduct the undercover investigation by placing informants aboard the fishing vessels for a week. ""We were living in very difficult conditions through really quite rough weather and having to eat and sleep for some days actually next to the dismembered carcass of a dolphin. It was horrendous,"" recounted Wickens. He said the vessel he was on was one of hundreds that was out to sea off Peru for most of the year targeting sharks. The fishing boat captain said all of the boats carry harpoons and aim to target one to three dolphins per trip. What's killing all those dolphins? NOAA thinks it's a virus . The fishermen knew the foreigners were journalists and allowed them on board for a week in exchange for fuel money and the protection of their anonymity, although they didn't realize the full scope of their investigation. According to Mundo Azul, violations of these regulations can be punishable with the suspension of concessions, authorizations, permits or licenses for 180 days and one to three years in jail. The Peruvian government has promised to investigate charges and is considering banning shark fishing to discourage the use of dolphins as bait. ""We're evaluating and if we find out that this is a widespread practice and the fishing of one species is affecting another, then we're going to take drastic measures. That means using tools at our disposal including banning the fishing of certain species as well as the sale of others,"" said Paul Phumpiu, Peruvian vice minister of fishing. When dolphins attack . The ban might be difficult considering dolphin hunting has financial incentives. The cost of fish bait in Peru has also gone up yearly, according to the fisherman. It seems to be part of the story around the world, Wickens said. Fewer fish in the sea means it costs more money to buy them. This isn't just an issue off Peru's coast. Since the video has been released, Wickens has been contacted by experts in Southeast Asia who've told him this practice might also be taking place close to Indonesian waters as well. He said it's hard to know how many dolphins are being killed worldwide because it happens out of sight. ""It's a conservation car crash. One apex predator being taken out of the ecosystem, being chopped up and fed to catch another,"" said Wickens, ""Whichever way you look at it, it's bad news for the ocean.""

"(CNN) -- If there were any doubts about the West's commitment to Ukraine, you can dispel them now after the European Union put forward a package of $15 billion, matching the sum initially offered by Moscow before Viktor Yanukovych was pushed out of power. The current tally is now $16 billion after a $1 billion commitment announced by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry during his visit to Kiev Tuesday. Ukrainian leaders have said they will be $30 billion in the hole by the end of 2015. About half of that debt comes due in 2014 and the country reportedly has about three months of cash reserves. Without the support from the European Union, voters would have gone to the polls in ""crisis mode"" with the state nearly out of cash. The move by the EU is also significant because it will also likely lead to funding from regional lenders: the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the European Investment Bank (EIB), both of which have deep pockets. International Monetary Fund officials are on the ground in Ukraine assessing the economic situation. Lending may prove to be more difficult in this period of transition. Shareholders in the fund, 188 member states, usually hesitate to provide money when temporary leadership is in place. It is complicated by Russian President Vladimir Putin holding the position that Yanukovych was forced out of office. Behind the scenes, commitments must also be coming from the Ukrainians to start cleaning up corruption, something that was flagged as essential by Kerry and during interviews I conducted this week. But IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde on Tuesday expressed some willingness to proceed as her team was landing in Kiev, saying in a statement ""we are ready to respond,"" and adding, ""we are also discussing with all our international partners -- bilateral and multilateral -- how best to help Ukraine at this critical moment in its history."" This is very different from the tone taken with Egypt after the ouster of Hosni Mubarak and the subsequent two years of turmoil. The $5 billion initially on the table from the IMF never materialized due to differences on how best to proceed with reforms. A crisis was avoided when Arab Gulf states filled the void with $15 billion instead. The stakes, some would say, are higher due to the Cold War history surrounding Ukraine. The next stage of the high stakes diplomacy surrounds whether G7 countries proceed with economic sanctions or not. While at a global financial forum here in Abu Dhabi, former European Central Bank President Jean Claude Trichet told me, ""economic sanctions would be appropriate of course if there is no deal"" between the U.S. and Russia. Former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker took a similar position suggesting that the G7 countries, led by Washington, are marking their support for Ukraine. ""They've sent the right signal so far which is saying 'hey wait a minute this is not acceptable; we don't like this and there is going to be some cost to it,"" Baker said.

"(CNN) -- From 1984 to 1999, Mitt Romney was in charge at Bain Capital, an investment firm that sought out small and sometimes troubled companies that, with careful management and Bain-provided cash, offered the chance for big profits. Bain, like many venture capital firms, invested in startups with the hope that the profits they made on the successes would outweigh the losses they incurred on the failures. Venture capital markets are simple things. Two groups of people who want to create new businesses come together. Venture capitalists have money but lack ideas. Entrepreneurs have ideas but lack money. When they get together, they trade and new businesses are born. We praise entrepreneurs as forming the foundation of a vibrant economy but vilify venture capitalists as money-grubbing opportunists. Entrepreneurs pour, sweat, blood and tears into their businesses, and we cheer them when it pays off. But we don't see the risk venture capitalists take by investing in entrepreneurs, and so when venture capitalists strike it rich we assume the profit is ill-gotten gains. When entrepreneurs, empowered by venture capitalists, take new ideas and turn them into new products and businesses, job creation occurs. Venture-backed businesses generate a large number of good jobs because businesses that require the financial muscle of venture capital usually require the intellectual muscle of highly skilled and educated labor. In 2008, more than 80% of the employees in the software industry, 74% of employees in telecom, 75% in semiconductors, and more than half in networking and electronics owed their jobs to venture capital, according to the National Venture Capital Association. From the end of 2009 to the first quarter of 2010, when the unemployment rate hovered stubbornly around 9%, job postings by venture-backed companies rose 16%. Venture capitalists won't always get it right though. Sometimes they'll encourage companies to take on too much debt, or they'll back ill-conceived business plans. When the venture capitalists and entrepreneurs make bad decisions, it hurts just as when the government makes a bad decision. But when venture capitalists and entrepreneurs make bad decisions, the people who are hurt are people who knowingly chose to invest, work for or do business with them. Venture capital brings together expertise and prudence. They are an experienced and hands-on bunch of people. They don't simply hand over money. They want spots on the boards of directors that give them the ability to monitor what the entrepreneurs are doing and to provide advice. And because it is often their personal money on the line, venture capitalists tend to be careful in considering the partnership of potential customers and entrepreneurs. Most politicians do not have the business experience to offer meaningful and smart investment advice. No wonder the government stands to lose more than $500 million from investing in Solyndra, a California-based solar panel manufacturer that declared bankruptcy last year. If there is any chance of our economy returning to normalcy, it will require our politicians to start putting more faith in businesses. A good way to start is to stop vilifying venture capitalists.

"(CNN) -- Bernie Ecclestone has revealed that Italian motor marque Ferrari has a veto over who will succeed him as the boss of Formula One. The British billionaire has managed F1's commercial rights since 1978 but there has recently been speculation over who could replace him as chief executive. Ecclestone turned 83 this year and is defending lawsuits on both sides of the Atlantic surrounding the sale of F1 to private equity firm CVC in 2006. Speaking before the season-ending Brazilian Grand Prix in November, Ecclestone told reporters for the first time who he would like to take over the reins. He said his ""ideal"" successor would be Christian Horner, team principal of the Red Bull Racing team which has won the F1 championship for the past four years. ""It needs someone who knows the sport. If someone comes in from outside, a corporate type, I don't think I could work with them. It wouldn't last five minutes,"" said Ecclestone. In a statement on Red Bull's official website on November 22, Horner said while he was flattered by Ecclestone's comments, he is ""fully focused"" on his role as team boss and has a long-term contract with the world champion team. Ecclestone has since explained to CNN how Horner's name was linked with F1's top job, saying: ""Somebody said to me, 'What happens when you go, what's going to happen?' ""Christian walked past and I said: 'What about him? He is a good guy.' ""Firstly CVC would never agree and secondly Ferrari would have a say,"" added Ecclestone. Ecclestone revealed that Ferrari needs to give consent to his successor, a detail that is written in the prospectus for the stalled flotation of F1 on the Singapore stock exchange. The prospectus states: ""We must obtain the written consent of Ferrari prior to the appointment of any person as our chief executive officer if, within the past five years, he or she has held a senior executive office or an ownership interest of 5% or more in any Team or automobile manufacturer which either owns more than a 5% interest in a Team or is a supplier of engines to a Team."" Ferrari's president Luca di Montezemolo also sits on F1's nomination committee, whose responsibility is to ""review and recommend candidates for appointments to the Board ..."" according to the prospectus. Di Montezemolo recently commented on Italy's RAI television about Ecclestone's anointment of Horner as his successor. The Italian commented: ""Ecclestone sees Horner as his successor? As the years go by, he more and more enjoys making jokes and I'm happy he still has the desire to do so."" A Ferrari spokesperson declined to give additional comment and told CNN: ""It is premature at the moment to discuss this topic further."" Ferrari is the only team which has competed in F1 every year since the championship was launched in 1950. Damon Hill, who won the F1 title for the Williams team in 1996, says he believes that Ferrari's power is down to its longevity. ""Ferrari has always been an exception in this sport and there may be good reason for that,"" Hill told CNN. ""Personally, I don't see how you can have a free sport where one competitor has got a special status but there seems to be some sound marketing reason. Teams that have had longer commitment to the sport have got a greater say in the sport and that is fair enough. ""That is the power Ferrari has always had over the sport."" Interactive: Do you understand F1's rule changes? As F1's controlling shareholder, CVC would also be closely involved with choosing Ecclestone's successor. Only 313 staff are employed by the F1 Group, the Jersey-based company which runs the sport. The company has only 10 members of senior management, with no chief operating officer or deputy for Ecclestone. David Campbell, the former European chief executive of entertainment group AEG, was said to be a successor for Ecclestone but left F1 just over a year after he was hired to run its corporate hospitality division in 2011. Others who have been tipped to take over from Ecclestone include Justin King, who runs British supermarket chain Sainsbury's, and Sir Stuart Rose, the former chief executive of its rival Marks & Spencer. But despite his advancing age and ongoing legal troubles, Ecclestone says he has no intention of giving up the wheel, and told CNN: ""I'm not going anywhere.""

"(CNN) -- A group of prostitutes has called on the Tunisian government to reopen a brothel in the coastal resort town of Sousse, after a court ruling shut it down more than a year ago. A delegation from the sex workers met with the vice president of the Tunisian Constituent Assembly, Meherzia Labidi, on Tuesday to appeal for her help. They handed over a petition signed by 120 women calling for the brothel to open for business once more, in a meeting filmed by Tunisian radio broadcaster Mosaique FM and shared with CNN Arabic. Labidi, of Tunisia's Islamist party Ennahda, which holds a majority of seats in the assembly, told the sex workers that deciding whether to reopen the brothel was up to the Ministry of Interior but that she would do what she could to help them. The official, who had her head covered, added, ""But we still have to recognize that any premise where prostitution commonly takes place, here or anywhere else around the world, is a real problem in itself."" A court ordered the brothel to close around November 2012, after a lawyer argued before a judge on behalf of neighbors in the area. The case came at a time when radical Islamists had launched a campaign in several parts of Tunisia against the licensed brothels. The head of the delegation told Labidi, ""There is no problem. ... We were attacked by the Salafists, radical Islamists, who attacked us and closed the premises by force."" Another woman in the group said that ""the neighbors do not have any problem with us and they already informed us that they would not mind that we reopen the brothel."" Other brothels that were shut down are operating again in the capital, Tunis, and in the city of Sfax, she said. ""We have to go back to our line of work because we are facing major financial catastrophes,"" she added. Labidi told Mosaique FM, ""These women are Tunisian and they have rights, and our duty is to serve them. I am ready to listen to everyone on the condition that I have the time and if their demands are possible and can be addressed in such circumstances; they have the right to be heard by everyone."" Although it is a conservative Muslim country, Tunisia allows prostitution in licensed brothels. Buying sex elsewhere is illegal. The country's licensed brothels date back almost a century and were first documented during the French colonial period. After independence, the Tunisian government reorganized the sector. Brothels were found in many provinces of the country, especially in areas popular with tourists from the region. Workers at a brothel are normally overseen by a woman and are subject to a regular health check. This is documented and regulated by the Ministry of the Interior, although it does not run the brothels.","Prostitutes hand over a petition appealing for the Sousse brothel to reopen .

"(CNN) -- Napoli has had a two-point deduction for match-fixing overturned following a successful appeal. The Serie A club was hit with the punishment following former goalkeeper Matteo Gianello's admission that he attempted to fix the club's game with Sampdoria in 2010. The Italian Football Federation (FIGC) judged that Napoli were ""objectively responsible"" for Gianello's actions. Napoli hit with match-fixing related points deduction . The FIGC also handed out six-month bans to defenders Paolo Cannavaro and Gianluca Grava for failing to report the approach, although both have had their suspensions lifted following the ruling. Napoli will now pay a $67,000 fine, while Gianello has had his ban reduced from 39 months to 21. The restoration of those two points also means Napoli are now joint second alongside Lazio in Serie A and just three points behind leaders Juventus. A statement from the FIGC Thursday said: ""The two-point penalty deduction has been annulled and Paolo Cannavaro and Gianluca Grava have been acquitted. ""Napoli will now pay a fine of 50,000 euros. ""There are acquittals for Paolo Cannavaro and Gianluca Grava, while the disqualification of Matteo Gianello has been reduced from three years and three months to one year and nine months. ""These are the decisions of the Federal Court of Justice following appeals against the judgments made by the Naples branch of the disciplinary committee on match-fixing."" Soccer players' union FIFPro to launch match-fixing hotline . The news came as a welcome relief for defender Cannavaro, who said he head been through ""hell"" since the original verdict was announced on December 18. He told the club's official website: ""It's an immense feeling of joy and I'm still crying with the emotion. It was a terrible month, hell. Now this is a release. ""I was in a really bad way. I won't be able to forget what I went through this month. I thank all those who were close to me. ""I want to thank the club for all that they did, the coach and my team-mates that have consoled me every day."" Grava was also in an emotional state at a press conference following the announcement. How can football tackle match fixing? ""When I heard from Paolo, we both started to cry with joy. It's the end of a nightmare,"" the 35-year-old said. ""It seemed like a nightmare from which I could not wake up. I'm feeling great joy and I am happy that justice has been done."" Head coach Walter Mazzarri felt the club had been vindicated for their stance and heaped praise on the duo. He said: ""First of all I am very happy for Paolo and Gianluca, two exceptionally honourable lads who were victims of a great injustice. ""I'm happy with the league table. We deserved those points because we earned them on the field. It would have been another great injustice if they had been stolen."" Juventus coach Conte has ban reduced to four months . The intense fight against match-fixing and illegal betting, which is known as 'Calcioscommesse', saw Siena deducted six points before the start of the season. Former Siena coach Antonio Conte, now in charge of Juventus, was handed a six-month ban for his failure to report attempts to fix matches in Serie B during the 2010-11 season. The ban was subsequently reduced to four months on appeal. .","Napoli has won it's appeal against the two point deduction for match-fixing .

"London, England (CNN) -- The shooting spree by taxi driver Derrick Bird across Cumbria, northern England has brought painful reminders of other mass shootings in the UK. The UK already has some of the toughest gun control laws in the world, introduced in the wake of two infamous UK mass shootings. In 1987, Michael Ryan, 27, killed 16 people in the southern English town of Hungerford, Berkshire, as he went on the rampage for several hours armed with a pistol, a hand grenade and an automatic rifle. Among Ryan's victims were his mother, a policeman who tried to stop him and a woman who was picnicking in a nearby wood with her two children. Ryan, who wore combat fatigues while he carried out the massacre, was eventually tracked down to an unoccupied college building, where he shot himself. The UK government introduced new legislation following the massacre under the Firearms (Amendment) Act of 1988, making it registration mandatory for owning shotguns and banning semi-automatic and pump-action weapons. Nine years later Thomas Hamilton, a former Scout leader, entered a school gym in the small Scottish town of Dunblane, Scotland. He opened fire on a group of five- and six-year children, killing 16 pupils and their teacher before killing himself. In 1997 legislation banned all pistols in the UK. Additionally after both Hungerford and Dunblane there were firearm amnesties across the UK, resulting in the surrender of thousands of firearms and rounds of ammunition. Anyone wanting to legally own a gun in the UK now has to hold a license. Police interview applicants who must disclose criminal convictions and explain why s/he wants a firearm. Checks are also made with the applicant's doctor -- sometimes to make sure the doctor does not have concerns about the applicant owning a weapon -- and sometimes independent medical advice can be sought. Calls for gun control in the UK are at their fiercest following mass shootings such as Hungerford, Dunblane and now Cumbria. Did you see anything? Send us photos, images . During the recent UK election, however, gun control barely figured amid the literature of the main political parties. The then Labour government said that: ""Homicides are at the lowest level for a decade -- gun murders are at their lowest for 20 years, and our gun laws are among the toughest in the world."" Meanwhile the Liberal Democrats, now members of the governing coalition, asked that hospitals share information on firearms injuries with police so that they could target appropriate geographical areas. Many holders of gun licenses are often affiliated to rural sports organizations. In a statement on its website the British Association for Shooting and Conservation (BASC) -- which had its origins in the sport of wildfowling -- expressed its ""deep shock"" at shootings in Cumbria. Simon Clarke, spokesman for the organization, said it was too early to comment on the shootings in Cumbria but added: ""Britain's firearms licensing system is amongst the toughest in the world and includes numerous safety and medical checks and balances. ""The UK has a well-worked approach to draw all possible lessons from any such event and we will co-operate fully where our expertise is appropriate."" CNN's Nick Hunt contributed to this report.","The United Kingdom has some of the toughest control rules in the world .
Tougher gun controls were introduced after mass shootings in 1987 and 1996 .
The recent UK election saw little discussion of gun control by political parties ."
"Boston, Massachussetts (CNN) -- Our government is utterly broke. There are signs everywhere one looks. Social Security can no longer afford to send us our annual benefit statements. The House can no longer afford its congressional pages. The Pentagon can no longer afford the pension and health care benefits of retired service members. NASA is no longer planning a manned mission to Mars. We're broke for a reason. We've spent six decades accumulating a huge official debt (U.S. Treasury bills and bonds) and vastly larger unofficial debts to pay for Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid benefits to today's and tomorrow's 100 million-plus retirees. The government's total indebtedness -- its fiscal gap -- now stands at $211 trillion, by my arithmetic. The fiscal gap is the difference, measured in present value, between all projected future spending obligations -- including our huge defense expenditures and massive entitlement programs, as well as making interest and principal payments on the official debt -- and all projected future taxes. The data underlying this figure come straight from the horse's mouth -- the Congressional Budget Office. The CBO's June 22 Alternative Fiscal Scenario presents nothing less than a Greek tragedy. It's actually worse than the Greek tragedy now playing in Athens. Our fiscal gap is 14 times our GDP. Greece's fiscal gap is 12 times its GDP, according to Professor Bernd RaffelhÃ¼schen of the University of Freiburg. In other words, the U.S. is in worse long-term fiscal shape than Greece. The financial sharks are circling Greece because Greece is small and defenseless, but they'll soon be swimming our way. To grasp the magnitude of our nation's insolvency, consider what tax hikes or spending cuts are needed to eliminate our fiscal gap. The answer is an immediate and permanent 64% increase in all federal revenues or an immediate and permanent 40% cut in all federal noninterest spending. Such adjustments go miles beyond anything Congress and the president are considering. No wonder. They are focused on limiting growth in the official debt, while ignoring what's happening to the unofficial debt. To understand the thickness of their blinders, note that the fiscal gap, after inflation, grew by $6 trillion last year, whereas the official debt grew by only $1 trillion. Hence, our leaders are looking at one-sixth of the problem. The August budget ceiling crisis deal calls for $2.5 trillion in budgetary savings over the next ten years. President Obama is unveiling plans Monday to cut the debt by $3 trillion. Both of these are peanuts compared to what's needed to start eliminating the fiscal gap. There is a way forward to deal with both our fiscal mess and the economy, which is lying on the operating table in desperate need of open-heart surgery. Such surgeries are called radical because they require radical intervention. But they are also extremely safe compared with the alternative -- administering Band-Aids and letting the patient die. At www.thepurpleplans.org, I provide five radical, but absolutely essential plans to fix taxes, health care, Social Security, the financial system, and energy policy. Collectively, they would more than eliminate the fiscal gap and get our economy out of the emergency room and onto the racetrack. The plans are called purple because they should appeal to blue Democrats and red Republicans. If neither party adopts them, I guarantee that a third-party candidate running via www.americanselect.org will. The Purple Tax Plan is of particular relevance now, given Obama's decision to push for a repeal of the Bush tax cuts for the rich and to levy a new tax on the super rich -- those with incomes above $1 million. The president wants to raise taxes. Can't argue with that. We desperately need much higher revenues along with much lower expenditures. Federal revenues measured as share of GDP are at a postwar low. And the president wants the rich to bear a bigger share of the tax burden. It's hard to disagree with this either. The rich have been getting off far too easy for far too long. But the Republicans want to ensure that more taxes don't mean more spending or smaller spending cuts than would otherwise arise. They also worry about high tax rates discouraging work, saving, and job creation by entrepreneurs. Most of us agree with both the president and the Republicans, which is possible because they're both talking past each other. But what we really want is a tax system that's simple, transparent, fair, and efficient. Neither the personal income tax, the corporate income tax, nor the estate and gift tax meet these criteria. Each is a bigger nightmare than the next. The Purple Tax Plan entails radical surgery. It eliminates the personal income tax, the corporate income tax, and the estate and gift tax. In their place it substitutes a highly progressive 17.5% federal retail sales tax plus a demogrant -- a monthly payment to each household, large enough that it reimburses the poor for the sales tax they've paid. (The 17.5% rate is the tax's nominal rate. Its effective rate is 15%, since 15 cents of every dollar spent goes to taxes and 85 cents to goods and services, with 15 divided by 85 equaling the 17.5% nominal rate.) If you're a Democrat, a sales tax, apart from the demogrant, probably sounds highly regressive. But nothing could be further from the truth. Taxing consumption is mathematically identical to taxing what's used to buy consumption, namely one's wealth and one's wages. Warren Buffett would effectively pay 15% on his wages, but also 15% on the principal of all his wealth, which is not now being taxed. The day the Purple Tax is implemented, Buffett will have the same number of dollars in wealth, but the purchasing power of his wealth will fall by 15%, thanks to the 17.5% higher costs of goods and services. And whether he spends his wealth on himself or gives it to his kids to spend, his wealth, plus any accumulated asset income, will buy 15% less in goods and services. The Purple Tax also makes the payroll tax highly progressive by eliminating its ceiling and exempting the first $40,000 in wages from the employee portion of the tax. Finally, the Purple Tax includes a 15% inheritance tax on inheritances and gifts received in excess of $1 million. Since the payroll tax is levied at close to a 15% rate, and the sales tax has an effective rate of 15%, and the inheritance tax rate is 15%, the Purple Tax plan imposes a single tax rate. This is very important for budgetary discipline. Under the Purple Tax, everyone will know that if Congress spends more on anything, the 15% effective tax rate will need to go up. The ongoing food fight between Obama and the Republicans is hiding the real game -- spending ever-larger sums on ourselves and leaving ever-larger bills for our kids. This fiscal child abuse must stop. The Purple plans would let both sides claim victory, save our kids, and get our economy back in the race. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Laurence J. Kotlikoff.","Laurence Kotlikoff: America's real fiscal gap is enormous .

"(CNN) -- Give him a position at the top of the agency; he's a good friend of the governor. That's how David Wildstein was introduced to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in 2010, according to a former employee with extensive knowledge of the agency's hiring practices. Soon after, Wildstein was named the director of Interstate Capital Projects, a title that previously had not existed at the bi-state agency, setting in motion a career that would eventually place the former political blogger at the center of the lane closures controversy at the George Washington Bridge. Wildstein catapulted into the national spotlight with his response to the infamous e-mail from New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's aide: ""Time for some traffic problems in Ft. Lee,"" Bridget Kelly wrote. Wildstein responded, ""Got it."" Read the emails . A former Port Authority employee told CNN that agency officials were told in 2010 they had to find a place for WIldstein at the executive level and the directive was coming from Christie's office. Soon after, the position was created specifically for WIldstein. When Wildstein started, Deputy Executive Director Bill Baroni, Christie's top appointee at the agency, introduced him to people as a good friend of the governor. Who is David Wildstein? CNN examined documents from the Port Authority showing the names, titles and salaries of nearly 7,000 employees. The reports show that prior to Christie's first term in office there were four people working in the deputy executive director's office, the highest position on the New Jersey side of the agency. When Christie came into office the number increased to six. The documents show that Wildstein's position was created in May 2010. Port Authority payroll records from 2012 . Port Authority payroll records from 2009 . Sources, including several current and former employees at various levels of the Port Authority who did not want their names used, told CNN it was assumed that when David Wildstein was involved in any discussions at the agency, the information was being passed back to Christie's office. Wildstein's role included scrutinizing the agency's business for the governor and that's why he was given such a broad title, sources said. Those current and former employees said people were careful about what they said when Wildstein was in the room, always assuming it would get back to Christie. Christie spokesman Colin Reed said the idea that Wildstein was the governor's eyes and ears is ""inaccurate"" and ""has been mischaracterized by the media."" ""As the governor made clear last week, David Wildstein is not a childhood friend and his interactions with him over the last four years have been limited. Last month, he appointed a new leader at the Port Authority with a proven record of rooting out corruption and reforming government agencies to help lead the agency,"" Reed said. Neither Baroni nor Wildstein responded to requests for comment from CNN. Wildstein personally directed the infamous lane closures on the George Washington Bridge in September. The revelations come in new Port Authority documents released on Thursday by the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee. They paint a picture of a man who went rogue, closing lanes without following proper procedures, despite warnings of traffic backups and safety risks. The governor is at the center of multiple investigations over whether the closure was political retaliation for the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee's failure to endorse Christie in his re-election campaign. Fort Lee mayor takes more measured tone after meeting with Christie . Christie distanced himself from Wildstein after the story broke. While he and Wildstein attended the same high school, Christie said, ""David and I were not friends in high school. We were not even acquaintances in high school."" High school acquaintances contacted by CNN backed up the governor. Christie was on Livingston High School's baseball team. Wildstein was the team's statistician. The former coach of the team, Tony Hope, said the two could not have been more different. ""Nobody could ever say a bad thing about Chris, they loved him. David was the extreme opposite,"" Hope said. ""David was very quiet, also extremely intelligent, but he didn't have great social skills ... he kept to himself, a nice individual but never really related to his peers."" Wildstein had a different reputation throughout the Port Authority. Several sources said he would sometimes yell and threaten to have employees fired when they repeatedly contradicted him or pushed back on his initiatives. The Newark Star Ledger reported in February 2012 that critics accused Christie of turning the Port Authority into a patronage mill. Citing a document titled ""NY/NJ Executive Referrals"" the newspaper showed there were 35 new Port Authority hires directed by Christie during his first year in office. That's more than the last four governors combined, according to the paper.","David Wildstein was introduced to Port Authority as good friend of Gov. Chris Christie .

"(CNN) -- Rwandan President Paul Kagame has won re-election with 93 percent of the vote, with all districts counted, the Rwandan National Electoral Commission said Wednesday. Turnout was registered at just over 95 percent, it said. Electoral observers had expected the outcome, and Kagame claimed victory after early results gave him a huge lead in the nation's second presidential race since the 1994 genocide. Observers said the voting was peaceful and ""largely accurate."" Kagame welcomed the early results at a massive party Tuesday at the national stadium in the capital of Kigali. Thousands of supporters got free drinks and danced to live music. ""This is your victory, this is a victory for all Rwandans,"" Kagame said during the celebration speech, in vernacular Kinyarwanda. ""Our development depends on you."" Human rights groups had expressed concern over violence and repression leading up to the vote, but Salim Ahmed Salim, chairman of the Commonwealth Observation Group, lauded the polling as transparent. ""Elections in Rwanda were conducted in a peaceful atmosphere,"" Salim said. ""The count in the polling stations was transparent and conducted fairly."" But while the vote was highly organized and efficient -- thousands of people had lined up before dawn at polling stations across the country -- observers said Rwanda's democracy faces challenges that include issues of political inclusion and press freedoms. ""There was a lack of critical opposition voices,"" Salim said. ""Each case appears to be different, but the overall impact is a concern."" Of three aspiring candidates, two are under arrest and another has fled to Europe. Three other candidates cleared by Rwanda's electoral commission ran on platforms similar to Kagame's and praised him throughout their campaigns. The only representatives at many polling stations were members of the ruling party, observers said. ""That, frankly, disappointed us,"" said Salim, though he placed responsibility on the opposition parties. ""This right is a key transparency issue."" The vote comes 16 years after Rwanda's genocide left at least 800,000 people dead. Militias made up of ethnic Hutus slaughtered ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus nationwide in 100 days of violence. The killing ended when Tutsi-led militias backing Kagame ousted the Hutu government supporting the massacre. In the aftermath, Kagame transformed his country, turning it into one of the fastest growing nations in Africa and -- in the view of some -- a model of economic and social development. Kagame's administration has mixed patriotic rhetoric with strict rules in an attempt to recreate society, and recently changed the official language for schools to English, rather than French. ""Liberation is a process,"" said Tito Rutaremara, the chairman of Kagame's party, the Rwandan Patriotic Front, and also the country's ombudsman. ""We want to create the nation.""","NEW: Paul Kagame wins re-election with 93 percent of the vote .

"Washington (CNN) -- Forget, for now, the traditional debates over taxes and spending or national security. The flashpoint in presidential politics, at the moment anyway, seems to be more about age. Or experience. Or maturity. Or something like that. Conservative columnist George Will labels the incumbent, President Barack Obama, an adolescent. Others from the right -- RedState's Erick Erickson among them -- are leading the charge in labeling Hillary Clinton too old. And the debate is hardly limited to what Republicans think of the current and perhaps future Democratic Party standard bearers. Bob Dole, who has firsthand experience on the receiving end of the age debate, took issue this past week with the ""younger"" members of the prospective GOP 2016 field. ""First-termers like Rand Paul, (Marco) Rubio and that extreme-right-wing guy -- Ted Cruz? All running for president now,"" Dole said. ""I don't think they've got enough experience yet."" That last part suggests Dole's beef has more to do with legislative experience than the actual age of the three freshmen senators thinking about running for president in 2016. Not to mention his clear ideological differences with them, especially Cruz and Paul. What Dole said publicly tracks a line of thought many Republicans debate more privately: After arguing for five-plus years now that Obama -- a freshman senator when elected -- wasn't ready for the highest office in the land, does it make sense for Republicans to nominate a freshman senator? Double standard on age? Ironically, that argument is advanced most by Republicans who anticipate Clinton as the Democratic nominee and use terms like experienced and formidable -- not old -- to describe her. For point of reference, Clinton is 66 now. Mitt Romney is 67. Jeb Bush is 61. Rick Perry is 64. Chris Christie and Rand Paul are 51. Paul Ryan is 44. Ted Cruz is 43, and Marco Rubio and Bobby Jindal are 42 . Dole was 73 when he became the Republican presidential nominee in 1996 -- the oldest first-time presidential nominee. Bill Clinton allies weren't shy, in public and even more so in private, in suggesting the Kansas senator was too old. Nor were Democrats, especially those in Obama's inner circle, shy about suggesting that 2008 GOP nominee John McCain, who was 72 on Election Day that year, was too old for the rigors of the presidency. So in some ways, what goes around comes around now that the age debate is focused on Hillary Clinton. She is 66 -- and would be 69 on Inauguration Day if she assumed the presidency in 2017. That is the same age as Ronald Reagan in 1981. So then is it sexist when conservatives who treat Reagan as a demigod say Clinton, the former secretary of state, would somehow be too old? Going too far . Writing this past week on CNN.com, conservative commentator David Frum said age was openly discussed when Reagan, Dole and McCain ran for president. So why not when Clinton runs? Fair enough. Like other candidates, Clinton will be asked to release health records and to make her doctors available for interviews. Some candidates are more cooperative than others on this front. But it is a fair, and relevant, avenue of inquiry, regardless of whether the candidate for president is a man or a woman. Or in his or her 40s or 60s for that matter. But how it is raised can make a huge difference. As a substitute host for Rush Limbaugh this week, RedState's Erickson tossed in a plastic surgery reference: ""She's going to be old. I don't know how far back they can pull her face."" He later argued on RedState that ""any objective fact about Hillary Clinton"" will be labeled out of bounds. Many conservatives make that argument, suggesting, as Frum also did, that Clinton thrives in a world of double standards. At times they have a case. But the cosmetic surgery line wasn't an ""objective fact about Hillary Clinton."" It was mean and, yes, sexist. Veteran GOP strategist Mary Matalin says many conservatives probably feel justified repeating against Clinton the age argument Democrats used against Reagan long ago. ""However justified they might be, it does feed right into the opposition meme,"" she said. Matalin is among those -- ""in the minority"" as she puts its -- not fully convinced that Clinton will run. But if she does, Matalin says, the age debate will intensify. ""The first to pick it up will be her primary opposition."" A veteran Democratic strategist close to Clinton said a politician's age becomes an issue only when the politician behaves in a way that makes it an issue. ""It's all how you act and think,"" the strategist said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Scott Reed, who was Dole's 1996 campaign manager, said just about anything, including age, can be relevant as a presidential campaign issue. But, he added, ""the woman thing is such an unknown."" Another GOP strategist with presidential campaign experience chimed in with a one-word ""nope"" when asked if it is wise to raise Clinton's age. ""Perhaps that her politics/policies are outdated, or that she has been part of D.C. too long,"" this strategist suggested. Life expectancy a more relevant point . A National Journal report on this debate this week smartly focused on a question more relevant than chronological age: the life expectancy of the candidate in question. A chart from that report suggests that Clinton ""would have the longest total life expectancy of any president yet."" Still, a Clinton candidacy -- assuming she won the Democratic nomination -- would present voters with a generational question. Her husband was 46 when he took office in 1993. George W. Bush was 54 in 2001. Obama was 47 in 2009. All three were elected to two terms; all three will have ended their presidencies in their 50s or early 60s. ""America doesn't go back,"" former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean said in a conversation several months ago -- meaning once the mantle of leadership is passed to one generation, he could not envision voters going back to an older generation. ""Except for Hillary,"" he said. ""She is the only one who could do it because of the historic aspect of her candidacy.""","Questions about potential GOP, Democratic presidential candidates' ages a flashpoint .
Both sides have alternately argued candidates are either too young or old over the years .
Political strategists say the relevance of the question depends on the way it is asked .

"(CNN) -- Scientifically, can happiness be an advantage? Some people think if you are happy, you are blind to reality. But when we research it, happiness actually raises every single business and educational outcome for the brain. How did we miss this? Why do we have these societal misconceptions about happiness? Because we assumed you were average. When we study people, scientists are often interested in what the average is. If we study what is merely average, we will remain merely average. Many people think happiness is genetic. That's only half the story, because the average person does not fight their genes. When we stop studying the average and begin researching positive outliers -- people who are above average for a positive dimension like optimism or intelligence -- a wildly different picture emerges. Our daily decisions and habits have a huge impact upon both our levels of happiness and success. Watch Shawn Achor's TED video to hear about this research . Scientifically, happiness is a choice. It is a choice about where your single processor brain will devote its finite resources as you process the world. If you scan for the negative first, your brain literally has no resources left over to see the things you are grateful for or the meaning embedded in your work. But if you scan the world for the positive, you start to reap an amazing advantage. See also: When losing your job is a positive . Now that there is research validity to these claims, the working world is starting to take notice. In January, I wrote the cover story for the Harvard Business Review magazine on ""Happiness Leads to Profits."" Based on my article called ""Positive Intelligence"" and my research in The Happiness Advantage, I outlined our researched conclusion: the single greatest advantage in the modern economy is a happy and engaged workforce. A decade of research in the business world proves that happiness raises nearly every business and educational outcome: raising sales by 37%, productivity by 31%, and accuracy on tasks by 19%, as well as a myriad of health and quality-of-life improvements. Given the unprecedented level of unhappiness at companies and the direct link between happiness and business outcomes, the question is NOT whether happiness should matter to companies. Given this research, it clearly should. The first question is: What can I do in my own life to reap the advantage of happiness? See also: Ambition could make you rich, but not happy . Training your brain to be positive at work is just like training your muscles at the gym. Sounds simple, right? Well, think about how easy it is to make yourself go to the gym. The key with any new resolution is to make it a habit. New research on neuroplasticity -- the ability of the brain to change even as an adult -- reveals that moderate actions can rewire the brain as you create ""life habits."" In The Happiness Advantage, I challenge readers to do one brief positive exercise every day for 21 days. Only through behavioral change can information become transformation. • Write down three new things you are grateful for each day; . • Write for two minutes a day describing one positive experience you had over the past 24 hours; . • Exercise for 10 minutes a day; . • Meditate for two minutes, focusing on your breath going in and out; . • Write one quick email first thing in the morning thanking or praising someone in your social support network (family member, friend, old teacher). But does it work? In the midst of the worst tax season in history I did a three-hour intervention at auditing and tax accounting firm KPMG, describing how to reap the happiness advantage by creating one of these positive habits. Four months later, there was a 24% improvement in job and life satisfaction. Not only is change possible, this is one of the first long-term ROI (return on investment) studies proving that happiness leads to long-term quantifiable positive change. In a study I performed on 1,600 Harvard students in 2007, I found that there was a 0.7 correlation between perceived social support and happiness. This is higher than the connection between smoking and cancer. So if in the modern world we give up our social networks to work away from friends and follow celebrities on Twitter, we are trading off with our happiness and health. Following up, I switched around the questions and asked how much social support employees provided (instead of received). The results were off the charts. Those high on provision of social support are 10 times more engaged at work and have a 40% higher likelihood of promotion over the next four years. In other words, giving at the office gets you more than receiving. The greatest cultural myth in modern society is that we cannot change. My research proves that you can not only become more positive, but if you prioritize happiness in the present, you can reap an extraordinary advantage. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Shawn Achor.","The greatest advantage in the economy is a happy workforce, argues Shawn Achor .

"(CNN) -- Forget the applications like video and audio streaming, or the built-in speakers. The most noteworthy feature of Google's new Nexus Q device may be this: It's made in the United States. When Google rolled out the device at its developers conference in San Jose, California, on Wednesday, reporters noticed the words ""Designed and Manufactured in the U.S.A."" etched onto the bottom. The gadget, about the size and shape of a Magic 8 Ball, is billed by Google as ""the first social streaming player."" It can be connected to a TV, has its own speakers, and can stream music and video from the cloud as well as connect an Android tablet or phone with home electronics. Google hasn't played up its origin, even though the vast majority of electronics are manufactured in China or other countries where labor is cheaper than in the U.S. A Google spokeswoman did not immediately reply to a message seeking comment for this story. But The New York Times reported Thursday that it had been given a brief tour of the plant, which it says is about 15 minutes from Google's headquarters in Mountain View, California, and that ""hundreds"" of employees appear to work making the Nexus Q. The tour was given on condition that the Times not report the factory's exact location. ""We've been absent (from the U.S.) for so long, we decided, why don't we try it and see what happens?"" Andy Rubin, Google's vice president in charge of the company's Android operating system, told the Times. Electronics companies, like those in many other sectors, for years have flocked to China to take advantage of cheap labor costs and loose business regulations. Most famously, Apple has appeared in headlines over its relationship with Foxconn, the Chinese manufacturer that makes its iPads and iPhones. Foxconn has been accused of unsafe and unfair working conditions in recent years. Apple has announced it's working to improve conditions at its supply-chain plants, and CEO Tim Cook visited a Foxconn factory earlier this year. But as wages and other costs begin to increase in China, a handful of mostly smaller companies has begun bringing those jobs back to the States. Late last year, an analysis by the Boston Consulting Group predicted that 2015 will be a ""tipping point"" when it will make more sense for many industries to keep their plants closer to home. ""A surprising amount of work that rushed to China over the past decade could soon start to come back -- and the economic impact could be significant,"" said Harold L. Sirkin, a senior partner and lead author of the analysis. ""We're on record predicting a U.S. manufacturing renaissance starting by around 2015."" The analysis predicts lower-tech manufacturing like textiles and apparel will stay overseas, while more complex products, like electronics and automobiles, might be more likely to be made in the United States.","Google's new Nexus Q media device is manufactured in the United States .

"(CNN) -- Peer at the windows and you'll spot big colorful chairs, plastic plants and a huge bed, but this is no department store. Welcome to the hip headquarters of Skyscanner, Europe's most popular flight search engine -- a hot-house of IT talent with an average employee age of 32. Leading the team is CEO Gareth Williams, who broke the golden rules of web start-ups. At first, there was no business model, just a bright idea. And, we're not in sunny Silicon Valley, California. It's another damp day in Edinburgh, Scotland. ""We probably went largely on instinct,"" said Gareth, ""you're supposed to use market research and a business model in mind, and we had neither of those things. ""We didn't know how we'd make money from the idea and we were just going on instinct that other people would like this,"" he added. Read more: Is Greece finally on the mend after economic crisis? Frustrated at the time it took to find cheap flights to visit his brother in France, the 44-year-old programmer spent a week building a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, the first version of Skyscanner. The next step was convincing the airlines to offer access to their schedules and fares. Gareth realized many customers will check Skyscanner first, before choosing to book directly with the airline's website. That creates valuable leads for the carriers. ""The quantity of traffic leads we send is so high, [and] the relative cost of our other distribution channels is so low that it's a really a great deal for them,"" he said. And the proof is in the numbers. Skyscanner says it's broadly doubled either users or revenue each year. Twenty-five million people search the site every month, leading to exponential expansion and new offices in Singapore, Beijing, Miami and Glasgow. Read more: Europe would have suffered without single currency . Its future growth will be fueled by investment from Sequoia Capital, which has had a hand in Google and Apple. Sequoia has valued the company at $800 million. ""It is recognition of what's possible anywhere in the world,"" says Gareth. ""But it's also recognition of what we see, and presumably they do too, that we've barely scratched the surface. Transport, tourism and hospitality is over 10% of the world's GDP, so the information needs are huge. ""We've barely begun on our journey, and the fact we're doing it outside Silicon Valley is an indication of an increasing trend."" Watch more: Supplying Germany with cheap, clean energy . The future, says Williams, is to make travel booking as intuitive as buying a book. In essence, it's making the web do more of the work. That includes offering suggestions based on previous travel, or even calendar entries, dragged across into the site. Voice recognition is another area of interest. Read more: How saffron could save Greek farmers . Skyscanner sees itself as a global player, rather than a Scottish business. Nonetheless, the country is engaged in a ferocious debate about its future, with a referendum on independence next year. The implications on doing business in Europe are still unclear. ""I can't do anything about it, so I ignore it and work on the things that affect me,"" said Williams. ""We're very proud to have originated in the port area of Leith. In terms of the European and local economies it will do what it will do. Death, taxes, Google and the economy, I have no control over."" Read more: Serbian confectioner enjoys sweet success . But Williams does have control over his surroundings. With his table tennis tables, meeting pods, barista coffee machines and staff perks like language classes, he has taken a little bit of Google and planted it in Edinburgh.

""We're right next to Edinburgh University which has one of the best computer science departments in Europe, if not the world, and having access to the graduates and the postgraduates coming out of there is a massive accomplishment for us,"" says Gareth.

"(CNN) -- Manchester United may face a new challenge on the field next season without Alex Ferguson but the English Premier League giant appears to have no domestic equals commercially with its ever expanding list of global sponsors. United, which won its 20th league title last year, announced a deal with Thai telecommunications group True Corporation Plc Monday -- taking its number of sponsors close to 40. According to a press release issued by the club, around 70 million people in Thailand watched United's games in the first seven months of last season, though the club did not disclose how much the new sponsorship deal was worth. True Group becomes United's official mobile partner and club broadcaster for Thailand -- the latest in a whole host of deals carried out by the Red Devils. ""When considering our partners, the club likes to ensure the company in question shares many of the same attributes that have allowed us to grow into the world's most recognized team,"" United group managing director Richard Arnold told the club's official website. ""True is a company that demonstrated many admirable qualities, itself crediting courage and the ability to take on new challenges as the key to its success. ""Since forming in 1990 it has continued to grow with the fast-paced telecommunications industry to become one of the best in its territory, proudly being the first to embrace many new technologies. ""Our new partnership is set to follow suit and provide our 20 million loyal and passionate Thai followers with exclusive content and footage, bringing them closer to the club they love."" In May, United reported a 52.2% increase in sponsorship revenue following deals with a Japanese social gaming company and two financial services firms in Denmark and Vietnam. In April, United signed an eight-year deal with insurance company Aon -- a move which saw the firm sponsor the club's Carrington training ground as well as its training kit for a reported $23 million. The Old Trafford club was placed in the New York Stock Exchange last August by its American owners, the Glazer family. Its revenues for the 2011/12 season increased by $21.6 million to $179 million -- placing it way ahead of its domestic rivals, despite an estimated gross debt of $560 million. Last year alone, United increased its value by 42% to $3.17 billion, according to Forbes business magazine. According to a study recently commissioned by the club, United's global fan base doubled to 659 million people between 2007 and 2012 with 325 million of those living in Asia. According to the Deloite Football Money League report for 2013, only Real Madrid and Barcelona are worth more than United, while Chelsea is the nearest English challenger. United will travel to Asia next month for a tour of the Far East and Australia with its opening game in Bangkok against the Singha All Stars -- a contest for which True Group will act as an associate sponsor. Meanwhile new United manager David Moyes officially began work Monday after replacing Ferguson at the helm. Ferguson, who won over 30 trophies in 26 years at the club, retired last season after leading United to a 13th Premier League title. The Scot also won two European Cups, five FA Cups, four League Cups, one European Cup Winners' Cup and one FIFA Club World Cup. Moyes, who has brought his own coaching staff from former club Everton, will work alongside assistant manager Steve Round, goalkeeping coach Chris Woods and first team coach Jimmy Lumsden. ""I have worked with Steve, Chris and Jimmy for a number of years and I am delighted they have decided to join me at this great club,"" Moyes told United's official website. ""They bring great qualities in their respective fields and I know that, like me, they feel that this is a challenge to relish. ""I have great faith that together, we can build upon the success this club has enjoyed over many years."" Moyes will welcome the players back to training later this week before the squad leave for Thailand on July 10.","Manchester United signs ldeal with Thai telecommunications group True Corporation .

"FORT LAUDERDALE, Florida (CNN)  -- Standing onstage, comedian Aron Kader describes how his cousin in the Middle East likes to curse the United States -- in English. Maz Jobrani (left) says Middle Easterners get a bad rap in the media. Ahmed Ahmed has the name of a ""most-wanted"" terrorist. ""Arabs love to cuss in English,"" Kader belts out. ""They cuss their heads off in English, but they won't do it in Arabic because then God can hear them."" The audience, two-thirds of Mideast descent, explodes in laughter. Kader is a member of the ""Axis of Evil"" comedy group, a collection of comics with Mideast roots who have formed a niche by taking on Mideast stereotypes and making subjects such as war, terrorism and suicide bombers funny. It's a delicate balance, but one that seems to be catching on with a larger audience. The comics' videos on YouTube have been viewed more than 200,000 times, they recently had a one-hour special on Comedy Central and they currently are on a 15-city tour with packed crowds. How do they make such serious topics funny? The key, Kader says, is getting the audience on board. ""Let them know that 'Hey, I get it, you guys have a stereotype of us, and I know what you see.' "" Ethnic humor has a long history in the United States, but Kader says being Middle Eastern is different. He says people too often think of militants, terrorists and suicide bombers. ""You just say you're Palestinian, and it's like you made a political statement."" And so the group has worked to try to change those stereotypes, one laugh at a time. In November 2005, the comics took up the name Axis of Evil, playing off the term President Bush used in his 2002 State of the Union address to describe Iraq, Iran and North Korea. There are four members of the Axis comedy group. Kader is a Palestinian-American, and Maz Jobrani is an Iranian-American with a degree in political science from the University of California, Berkeley. (Jobrani was one of the stars of the ABC series ""The Knights of Prosperity."") Rounding out the Axis are Ahmed Ahmed, an Egyptian-American, and Dean Obeidallah, a Palestinian-American who once was a practicing attorney. Their biting humor is something to which many in their audience can relate. Jobrani says when he tells one joke begging for the news media to show Middle Easterners doing something positive -- like ""baking a cookie or something"" -- the crowd loves it for more than just its humor. ""That gets a laugh, but it also gets a clap from regular audiences, and I think that's because a lot of people are sick of seeing Middle Easterners depicted the way we're always depicted,"" he says. Obeidallah says he never felt like a Middle Easterner until after the September 11, 2001, attacks. Now, he says, he does his comedy ""not just for me."" ""It's for my cousins, it's for my friends, it's for other Arabs and other people who get dirty looks or looked at funny because they have an accent or are viewed as suspicious simply because of their heritage,"" he says. ""We don't want to be defined any longer by the worst examples in our community, and it's a very small amount of people. There are a few terrorists and they define all of us."" Ahmed says he gets problems at the airport -- because his name matches the alias of a terrorist on the FBI's ""Most Wanted"" list. But he takes it in stride. Like his fellow Axis comedians, he says, you can ""scare people into laughing."" He quotes a comedy colleague who is a rabbi. ""He always says you can't hate anybody when you're laughing with them. So it's nice, when we're doing our comedy show, to see the diversity in the crowd and people actually laughing together,"" Ahmed says. ""You see Arabs and Jews and Mexicans and whites, and they're all sitting together and they're sharing the same laugh. Comedy's like food or music. It's universal. Laughter's universal.""

"(Budget Travel) -- Looking for cheap airfares for your big trip abroad but suffering from search fatigue? When all else fails, try one of these tested strategies. Even if you've packed your bags, being flexible on departure dates could save you money. Strategy No.1: Start your search at Kayak.com . We find that meta-search site Kayak is the all-time best place for scoring the cheapest plane tickets. Our biggest beef with Kayak's competitors is that, when you click to book a fare, you're typically directed to a new page. Sometimes it's only then that you find out your actual departure time. Or worse, you're forced to plug in your dates and departure cities all over again, only to discover more-expensive fares. Kayak stands apart. Once you've found a good flight, click on the price and you'll be sent directly to the airline's Web site, where the exact price for the exact flight you selected unfailingly appears. Strategy No. 2: Use fare-history charts . It's the classic dilemma: Should you buy the best fare you see today or wait because the price might go down? Here's how to come up with an educated guess. Use Kayak to fetch fares for your itinerary and then click on ""Show chart of fare history,"" which is a link near the top left-hand corner of the search results. If the chart says that the average fare for your route is much higher than the fare you're seeing today, then you should probably book the ticket because it's cheap relative to historic prices. Strategy No. 3: Monitor fares and be ready to jump . Plug in your dates and routes, as well as a price threshold, at a fare-tracking service, such as Yapta or Hotwire's TripWatcher. Each site will ask you to join (free), and then will do several price searches per day. You'll receive an e-mail alert as soon as the flight drops to your specified price. To name your ""trigger"" price, look at Kayak's fare-history chart to see the lowest fare recorded for this route, and use an amount close to that as your baseline. Yapta is the industry leader for tracking fares -- even Google incorporates Yapta's data in its search results. Hotwire's TripWatcher is also excellent, allowing you to program automatic searches of your chosen route over a 60-day window (which is a nice perk and increases the chances you'll find a bargain fare as long as you can be flexible in your travel dates). There is a catch, though: While both sites cover popular routes, neither covers the entire world. Strategy No. 4: Run a flexible-date search . You may save hundreds of dollars by moving your departure or arrival dates by a day or two, either earlier or later. To see how much you might save, we recommend you take Kayak's flexible-date search tool for a spin -- it covers the broadest range of routes and airports of the competing tools we tested. In our trials, Expedia's flexible search came up with only the most popular routes, so your route may not qualify. Orbitz's flexible-date calendar gave a nice overview of fares on various days, but departure times were not initially shown. Travelocity provided a few different ways to search flexibly -- either within a few days of a selected date, or over selected months -- but like Orbitz it failed to show dates and departure times right away. Finally, relative newcomer Trax.com's flexible search tool lacked a ""search nearby airports"" feature, which meant it gave you fares from major airports, but missed cheaper fares departing nearby. In short, Kayak is your best bet for a flexible-date search. Strategy No. 5: Book two tickets instead of one . You may save hundreds of dollars if you split your international journey into different legs and buy separate tickets for each leg. For example, rather than buy a single ticket for direct flights between Chicago and Barcelona for $1,000, you may be able to buy two tickets -- one for a round-trip ticket between Chicago and New York City for $200 and another for a round-trip ticket between New York City and Barcelona for $600 -- and save about $200. The quickest way to figure out if you can save by booking two tickets is to figure out if there is a hub airport that funnels most American travelers to your overseas destination. Then, look into reserving separate tickets to and from that hub. For instance, Miami is the hub for flights to most destinations in South America and the Caribbean, meaning that a majority of Americans flying southward internationally pass through Miami's airport instead of, say, either Houston or Atlanta. Another hub airport is Los Angeles' LAX, which is the main funnel for people heading to Australia, the South Pacific, and Asia. New York City's airports are common layover spots for most of the planes crossing the Atlantic to Europe and points beyond. We recently tested this approach for a round-trip between Houston and Sydney. Our initial searches on a few travel Web sites didn't turn up any nonstop flights between the two cities, but we did find multi-stop tickets. Delta's best fare between Houston and Sydney in November was $1,012, with a stop in Los Angeles. That caught our eye. If there's a large number of flights to Australia passing through L.A., then the City of Angels might offer bargain direct flights to Down Under -- because the greater volume of flights often prompts a greater number of fare sales. So we checked out fares between L.A. and Sydney. It turns out they started at $652. Next, we did a quick search for round-trip airfares on flights between Houston and Los Angeles. We found flights for $252, bringing our two-flight total to $904 -- for a savings of 11 percent over Delta's flight for $1,012. If you decide to book two tickets on two different airlines, be sure to allow extra time to make your connections, and consider buying good travel insurance to make sure you're covered in the event of a problem. You can save money on insurance policies by buying them directly from an insurer, such as industry giant TravelGuard, rather than through a middleman, who will charge a marked-up price. Strategy No. 6: Shift your trip to another month . When all else fails and you just can't get the fare you want, think about off-season travel. In a guidebook, look up your destination's high (or peak) season, low season, and in-between (or ""shoulder"") season. Then travel at a time when your destination is less crowded -- and travel costs are correspondingly lower. But don't get rained on: before you opt for a cheaper season, you'll want to know about the average weather, so search your guidebook (or a site like weather.com) for monthly trends. Web searches on sample itineraries will also reveal which months are cheaper to visit your destination. For instance, we recently discovered that fares from Houston to Australia were as much as $800 lower in November than in January.

"(CNN) -- Luxury fashion houses have long aspired to capture the imagination of the affluent shopper with their sleek designs and bespoke merchandise. But with online-shopping on the rise, enticing customers in-store has become increasingly difficult spurring retailers to dream up new ways to woo and dazzle shoppers. By moving beyond the product, high-end labels are revolutionizing the shopping experience with immersive ""retail destinations"" that bring the consumer and brand closer together. ""You are buying into the retail experience as well as paying for the brand experience,"" says Jon Copestake, chief retail analyst for the Economist Intelligence Unit. ""Creating consumer shopping experiences and creating this feeling of exclusivity are things that all retail firms will aspire to."" In-store adventures . The newly unveiled Louis Vuitton ""Townhouse"" inside London's iconic Selfridges department store is the most recent example of this. After shoppers make their way through the impressive art deco-style entrance, they are met with a striking centerpiece reminiscent of Willy Wonka's own great glass elevator. Wrapped with undulating spirals in the shape of a giant double helix -- the state-of-the-art circular elevator gently revolves inside a glass tube taking customers on a journey of surprise and discovery within the three-storey luxury boutique. Four years in the making, the unique 'store within a store' concept -- the first of its kind in the UK -- is the brainchild of French-born designer Gwenael Nicolas, who collaborated with the label. ""Retail tourism is potentially one of the big growth areas for luxury,"" says Copestake. ""It's not out of kilter with what you would expect firms to do especially given they are looking to be driving foreign consumers and retail tourists into stores."" Beating out competitors like Hermes and Chanel, Louis Vuitton's brand value was estimated to be worth a staggering $23.58 billion, according to global brand consultancy Interbrand in May. To put that into perspective, that's more than double Gucci, valued at $9.45 billion. With the luxury world weathering the financial downturn better than some might have expected, high-end luxury brands have had the resource to invest in digital innovation and the in-store experience, explains Copestake. Digital innovation leads the way . Burberry has invested heavily in a savvy digital portfolio masterminded by outgoing CEO Angela Ahrendts, a key to the heritage brand's strong growth. With many of Burberry's customers shopping online, Ahrendts set out to produce a digital platform which combined social media and enterprise software to form an innovative one-stop shop. The move helped revamp the iconic British brand's image while appealing to younger consumers and extending Burberry's global reach. And the digital experiment has proven to be a success as the company announced a 21% increase in global first quarter sales, with China delivering the strongest growth. Back at the Louis Vuitton ""Townhouse"" in London, the world's most valuable brand has also opted for a digital media experience. With it's ""Digital Atelier"", customers get a personalized experience with touchscreen technology that allows them to design their own bespoke bags. Fashion blogger Bryan Grey Yambao -- better known as Bryanboy -- agrees that the luxury consumer experience has been enhanced in recent years by labels embracing digital innovation. ""Whether you are Ralph Lauren or Tommy Hilfiger or a luxury brand like Louis Vuitton or Hermes, your brand really has to go beyond the merchandise that you offer,"" says Bryanboy. ""These brands make an imprint in [the consumer's] mind saying ""This is what we stand for. This is what we offer. We give you a sense of luxury,"" he adds.

""There is an element of caution here. The problem lies in brand dilution and brands would have to manage this very carefully,"" he says.

"(CNN) -- Brazil's economic powerhouse was once thought of as the ugly sister to Rio de Janeiro's beach-fronted glamour. São Paulo, the world's fifth-largest city, is the fashion capital of Brazil. But, over the past few years, São Paulo's fashion, music and design scenes have gained such momentum that it's tipped by some as a cooler destination than more touristy Rio. True, São Paulo doesn't have a beach, nor does it go out of its way to cater to foreign visitors, but hidden in the sprawl is a trove of hip hotels and restaurants, modernist architecture and some of the best shopping south of the Equator. It would take a lot longer than a day to discover everything São Paulo has to offer, but our guide should help visitors short on time to navigate the city's immense grid of skyscrapers and traffic jams to find an entirely different Brazilian experience. Watch the sun come up over the world's fifth-largest urban area like many of its mega-wealthy inhabitants -- with a helicopter ride over the city. Tourist rides normally leave from Campo de Marte Airport and take in aerial views of city landmarks such as Ibirapuera Park and Avenida Paulista. You may have worked up an appetite by now, so head back into town for breakfast on Rua Oscar Freire, São Paulo's answer to Rodeo Drive. Eat delicious cheese bread known as pão de queijo, fruit, yoghurt and granola, and wash it down with a freshly squeezed juice or coffee at Oscar Cafe. The prosperous, tree-lined avenues of the surrounding area, known as Jardims, are perfect for a bit of shopping. Look out for Clube Chocolate, where you can buy upscale designerwear in divine surroundings (Rua Oscar Freire 913) and Endossa, a collaborative shop filled with cubes of shelving where entrepreneurs can rent a cubby-hole to sell their wares. From here it's possible to walk to Avenida Paulista, São Paulo's financial district, and there you can mill past some of the most expensive real estate in South America with the Paulistano businessfolk on your way to take in some culture at MASP, also known as São Paulo Museum of Art. Once you've had your fill of high culture, take in some of São Paulo's famous street art on Beco de Batman, which translates as ""Batman Alley."" Every inch of this street in the super hip Vila Madalena area is covered in graffiti, much of it by well-known local artists. Recharge your batteries with a beer and snack on empadas, delicious miniature pies with a variety of fillings like palm hearts, Portuguese salted fish and cheese at Empanadas (Rua Wisard 489, Vila Madalena). Otherwise, why not hop in a cab and head over to Liberdade to check out the home of the biggest Japanese community anywhere in the world outside Japan? Check out the Buddhist temple (Rua São Joaquim), karaoke bars and sushi restaurants -- one of the best of which is Takô (Rua da Glória 746, Liberdade). With its green-copper facade, the Hotel Unique is just one example of São Paulo's stunning modern architecture. The highlight of this area, if you happen to be lucky enough to be there at the right time, is the anything-goes weekend market Feira da Liberdade (Praça da Liberdade), and if you're even luckier you might catch one of the sumo competitions held there from time to time. After all these hours in the concrete jungle you may be longing for a bit of green, which you can find in ample supply in the enormous Ibirapuera Park. As you wander the tree-lined walkways, dodging throngs of body-conscious Paulistanos exercising along the way, you will encounter one masterpiece of modernist architecture after another -- mostly designed by the father of Brazilian modernism Oscar Niemeyer. Look out for the beautiful sci-fi dome, Oca, and the Grande Marquise, an extraordinary white pavilion that houses MAM (Museu de Arte Moderna) and features expanses of covered concrete which attract many of the city's skateboarders. No visit to São Paulo, or indeed any part of Brazil, is complete without trying a caipirinha -- a winning combination of the local firewater, cachaça, smashed limes, sugar and ice. If spirits are a bit much for you, try a divine -- and very Paulistano -- twist on the original with squished kiwi fruit and sake. You could combine a few cocktails with catching the final rays of the day on the rooftop of another of São Paulo's modernist masterpieces, Edifício Itália (Terraza Italia Restaurant, Avenida Ipiranga 344). Here you can enjoy a breathtaking panorama, with another Niemeyer masterpiece -- the wavy-façaded Edifício Copan -- in full view. It's got to be dinner time by now. In São Paulo your options are almost unlimited. With huge populations of Japanese, Italians and even Lebanese, the problem is not where to eat but how to choose. A highlight of São Paulo's dining scene has to be Restaurante Figueira Rubaiyat, where you can eat awesome steaks and very good seafood in a dining room that has been built around an enormous fig tree. If you're still rearing to go after that little lot, São Paulo's nightlife options are almost endless. You can shake your moneymaker with the best of them at one of the city's clubland stalwarts Love Story, or if you are looking for something a little more low-key, then why not round off the day on the rooftop terrace of the Skye Bar at Hotel Unique. The hotel's space-age green copper façade is indeed unique, and it is also a good bet for a bed for the night in really special surroundings.","São Paulo's art, fashion and music scene means it's no longer second to Rio .

"(CNN) -- On Wednesday, Gov. Nathan Deal signed Georgia's Safe Carry Protection Act into law. Many gun proponents love House Bill 60, but it will create unintended problems for law enforcement, local governments and the citizens they serve. Although changes in the state's gun laws were meant to strike a balance between the rights of gun owners and the government's interest in protecting its citizens, unintended consequences may follow that don't make anybody safe. Picture this: It's a pleasant summer day. The kids are out of school, and you've decided to take them to the local park. You're sitting on a park bench in the shade, watching them play, when you suddenly notice a man dressed in a heavy winter coat approaching the playground. As he scurries past you, you notice a handgun strapped around his waistband. Alarmed? You should be. Who is this man, and why is he armed at your children's playground? Concerned enough to call the local police? Not a bad idea, but here is the problem. Starting July 1, law enforcement in Georgia will not be able do much for you. As a matter of fact, they could get sued if they detain the man you called about and ask him whether he has a valid weapons carry license. That's because, under Georgia's revised Safe Carry Protection Act, it is prohibited for police to detain someone for the purpose of checking for a license. So much for safe. But wait, it gets better. Worried about convicted felons toting guns? Rest assured, convicted felons are still prohibited from possessing firearms in Georgia -- except in the act of self-defense. But, you might ask, don't you have to possess a firearm first in order to be able to use it in self-defense? Correct. So, what kind of sense does that make? It doesn't. It encourages gun ownership and use by convicted felons. Think about it. All they have to do now is claim ""self-defense."" Feeling safer already? Finally, Georgia's revised Safe Carry Protection Act may also cost you more money. Before this law, cities could simply prohibit firearms or any other weapons in government buildings by posting a sign; now, they can do so only by screening entrances into the government building with security personnel. And guess who ends up paying for that? That's right, the taxpayer. And if the police officer is sued for asking to see a gun carry permit, who will pay for his or her defense? It will be up to the municipality, using taxpayer funds. But not only does it cost us more, it also has a chilling effect on open government. Many citizens might feel discouraged from visiting their local government offices, knowing that they are now subject to being screened. While these revisions certainly favor the rights of gun owners, they create dilemmas for local law enforcement and government. As a police chief, my main concern is the safety our residents. As police, we have taken an oath to protect and serve, and this new law doesn't help us.","Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal signed Safe Carry Protection Act .

"(CNN) -- Neil Young has long complained about the quality of digital music formats. Now he's doing something about it -- and he's getting help from some friends. Bruce Springsteen, Eddie Vedder, Tom Petty and Sting were among the artists who joined Young in a video to promote a Kickstarter campaign for Pono, a digital music service and device designed to ""bring the highest-quality digital music"" to consumers, according to its press announcement. Young himself was at Austin's SXSW event to demonstrate the service. ""Every part of my body is getting hit with this,"" Young said of his experience with Pono, according to the San Jose Mercury News. ""My soul is feeling it. I am doing what I use to do: I'm listening. I'm feeling. And I'm experiencing. I am living music."" The idea behind Pono is to boost digital music from the compressed and lossy formats to high-quality resolution. Pono will stream music in 24-bit, 192 kHz sound -- brighter and more present than the ""underwater listening,"" as Young describes it, provided by MP3s and even CDs. The death of the home stereo system . Young has made no bones about his disgust with MP3 and similar file formats. ""The simplest way to describe what we've accomplished is that we've liberated the music of the artist from the digital file and restored it to its original artistic quality -- as it was in the studio,"" Young wrote last year on Pono's Facebook page. His musical friends were all for it. ""I got my drug of choice,"" said Vedder, who was part of an all-star lineup raving about Pono in the video. ""It's now potent again."" ""He's developed something that creates a very warm analog sound that takes even your digital records that gives them ... a closeness, an intimacy that digital recording can lose very easily,"" said Springsteen on the video. The Kickstarter campaign was intended to raise $800,000. It blew past that goal in less than 24 hours. As of midday (ET) Wednesday, it's closing in on $1.5 million in pledges. Though the site takes donations in any amount, people who pledge $400 or more will receive a PonoPlayer Artist Signature Series from their choice of musicians including Patti Smith, Beck and the Dave Matthews Band, among many. The PonoPlayer devices have 128 GB of memory, capable of storing 1,000 to 2,000 high-resolution digital albums, according to the press release. They will be sold at PonoMusic.com for $399 each. Albums will likely sell for between $14.99 and $24.99. The campaign runs through April 15.","Neil Young is introducing Pono, his high-resolution digital music service .

"(CNN) -- Veteran infielder Miguel Tejada -- a former American League MVP -- has run afoul of Major League Baseball over the issue of prohibited drugs. Commissioner Bud Selig's office announced Saturday that the Kansas City Royals player has been suspended 105 games, without pay, for violating the league's drug prevention and treatment program. Tejada tested positive for an amphetamine, the league said in a press release. His suspension takes effect immediately. Fast Facts: Performance Enhancing Drugs in sports . Tejada told ESPNDeportes.com -- according to that website, which is tied to ESPN -- that the positive test stems from his use of Adderall, which he took for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. He claimed Major League Baseball had given him permission to use the drug, but that permission expired April 15. ""I admit I committed an error, but I want people to understand one thing: I was not taking any drugs to have an advantage on the field,"" Tejada said. A native of the Dominican Republic, Tejada broke into the big league with the Oakland A's. He emerged as one of baseball's most dynamic and productive shortstops and hitters, even taking home the American League MVP honors in 2002. But as he's bounced around the big leagues since then -- including stops in Baltimore, Houston and San Francisco, before landing with Kansas City before this season -- Tejada also has been dogged by performance-enhancing drug questions. In 2009, he was charged with making false statements to Congress during testimony four years earlier. Days later, he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge and was sentenced to one year of unsupervised probation. Saturday's suspension comes in the wake of a large group of suspensions affecting players such as Alex Rodriguez and Ryan Braun tied to performance-enhancing drugs out of Biogenesis, a now shuttered south Florida clinic. The commissioner's office Saturday gave no indication that Tejada's suspension was related to those cases.

"(CNN) -- The Olympic torch has wound its way through more than 100 cities in the relay leading up to next month's Winter Games in Sochi, Russia. But the turn it took Monday highlighted a fear held by many people across the globe. A runner carried the torch through Makhachkala, capital of Dagestan -- a region embattled by Islamic insurgents. The event went off without a hitch, with security in place and some cheering supporters lining the streets. But the international focus on that moment served as a reminder of the militants who have carried out deadly attacks recently in Russia, and who have threatened more. Russia is working to ""ensure that there will be joyful, peaceful, and successful Olympic games,"" the country's ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak, told CNN on Sunday, insisting he is ""absolutely certain"" the Games will go off without any terrorist attacks. But Rep. Peter King, R-New York, a member of the Homeland Security Committee and chairman of the Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence, said he cannot give a ""100% guarantee."" ""These are going to be very much threatened Olympics -- probably more than any we've had in our past,"" he told ABC's ""This Week."" In a statement posted Monday on an Islamist website, militants wrote that ""Russia has been warned."" Pointing to recent deadly bombings in Volgograd, the group said, ""Mujahideen are guided in everything by Sharia,"" referring to Islamic law -- which, the statement said, allows for killing women and children if they cannot be separated from men in such attacks. Many Islamic scholars insist Muslim law does not permit killing innocent civilians. The statement did not specifically mention the Olympics or Sochi. The United States has offered counterterrorism expertise, equipment and warships to help Russia through the Olympics. ""Whatever we can do, we want to do to help, but right now there has been no request from the Russian government,"" Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said Friday. Some athletes' families staying home . Washington has warned U.S. athletes not to wear their uniforms outside the Games' so-called ""Ring of Steel."" Some athletes' families are staying home. ""The threat is real,"" said Roberto Carcelen, an Olympic cross-country skier, in an interview from Russia on CNN's ""New Day."" ""The Olympics are built on the foundation of peace and freedom values, so this is kind of the perfect environment for terrorist groups"" to have their voices heard, he said. ""I really wanted to go,"" his wife, Kate Carcelen, told ""New Day."" ""I wanted to bring my daughter. She's 6, so it would be a really great experience for her."" But amid growing fears of an attack, she said, Roberto acknowledged that it would be stressful for him to worry about their safety while competing in the Olympics. ""I'm going to be up training in the mountains while the family would be down in the city outside the Olympic rink,"" he said. ""So that puts a lot of pressure on me as an athlete."" Sequocoria Mallory-Lucas, mother of U.S. bobsled team member Aja Evans, is still planning to attend. ""She is doing fine as far as feeling assured that she's going to be OK and safe and that we will be OK and safe,"" Mallory-Lucas told ""New Day."" ""I'm not afraid to go -- I'm excited about going. And I'm certainly encouraged that the United States has offered to lend a hand to Russia and that Russia has really made this a top priority, their security concerns and preparation."" If needed, the United States will extract its citizens, Hagel said. That's part of a standard security plan, said Fran Townsend, CNN national security analyst and former U.S. counterterrorism adviser. Americans who attend the games, Townsend said, should register their trip with the U.S. government. They should also be cognizant of their environment and find out about the tip line for security services while they're in the country.

"(CNN) -- The search for debris that could belong to missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 evokes different emotions for relatives of the passengers. Some just want closure; others might have their hopes of seeing their loved ones alive dashed. The objects, seen in satellite images taken Sunday, have not been confirmed to be parts of the missing plane. The first search plane to fly over the area found no sign of debris. Still, Malaysia's interim transportation secretary called it a ""credible lead."" So the hopes and fears of the passengers' families are once again floating to the surface as they await a definitive answer on the newest clue. ""It strikes me as just one more lead that may or may not come true,"" said Sarah Bajc, the partner of American passenger Philip Wood. ""So it's enough to make us all anxious again after a couple of days of quiet, but you know, I'm cautiously pessimistic that it's not a piece of the plane."" Bajc's intuition is that the passengers are alive, the victims of a hijacking plot in which their return remains a possibility. ""So if this debris is indeed part of that plane, then it kind of dashes that wishful thinking to pieces,"" she told CNN's Chris Cuomo. ""So I really hope it's not a part of the plane, but, you know, if it is, then at least we can go down another path of deciding that maybe we need to start preparing for another scenario instead."" Officials from Malaysia Airlines met with passengers' families in Kuala Lumpur behind closed doors for about two hours Thursday. They were shown the satellite images that were used to pinpoint the debris but also told that there is no confirmation that it is the plane. The families, for now, were reserving judgment on what the new development may bring. Many who entered the meeting were stoic, doing their best to stay composed in stressful times. Relatives waiting at a Beijing hotel watched on TV as Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott briefed the Australian Parliament on the ""new and credible"" information about the two objects in the southern Indian Ocean that could be from the plane. The families' mood was tense as they watched Abbott report the new findings. A heavy sigh punctuated the attentive atmosphere, giving voice to their frustrations. As they listened to a Chinese translation of the news conference, the relatives hung on every word, sitting up straight or edging forward. Psychologists attending to the relatives in Beijing are worried that when definitive news comes out, it could be overwhelming for the families. Some of the elderly have reported suicidal thoughts because their only children -- products of China's one-child policy -- were on Flight 370. It could be just as hard on the families if the debris turns out to be a false lead. ""I firmly that believe my son, together with everyone on board, will all survive,"" said Wen Wancheng, a missing passenger's father. ""This is the first time in my life to experience something like this,"" he said. ""In the past I just watched other peoples' stories on the news. I watched explosions, ships sink and plane accidents. Those were other peoples' stories. This time, it is my turn for bad luck. It is my turn to actually experience this. This is not watching news; it is living it."" At the hotel in Beijing where the briefings are held, a message board was put on a wall and, within a few hours, was overflowing with notes. ""Dear dad, I miss your face, I miss holding your hand, I miss hearing your teachings and your wisdom,"" one message said. Malaysian acting Transportation Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said he understands that the news about the debris will be foremost on the families' minds. ""We do care about them, and we understand what they are going through,"" he said. ""For the families around the world, the one piece of information that they want most is the information we just don't have: the location of MH370,"" he said. Bajc disagreed that the relatives are a priority for the officials. ""I don't necessarily think the people investigating the situation are particularly caring about what the families feel like. They're caring about finding the plane, and that's probably as it should be,"" she said. In Kuala Lumpur, where Flight 370 originated, families had the same mixed feelings as those in Beijing and elsewhere. Selamat Bin Omar, the father of one of the passengers, said he hopes those on board are still alive but is ready to acknowledge that the plane may have met another fate. ""My feeling is, personally, I am grateful to the Australian government for finding it,"" he said. ""Both governments, Australia and Malaysia. I thank them. If it's true, I will accept that."" Malaysia Airlines said it won't be sending representatives or family members to Australia unless the objects are confirmed as plane debris.

But let's get real: Your chances of actually playing the right combination of numbers and striking it rich through the lottery are slim. How slim? Try one in 1 in 175,223,510. That means you have a greater chance of being killed by a shark, according to National Geographic. Those odds are 1 in 3,700,000.

"(CNN) -- Eight years ago, the secret weapon of Democrat Howard Dean's upstart campaign for president was a little-known website called Meetup.com, which was launched in 2002 to make it easy for people with a common interest to find each other and arrange to meet, face to face. The site's founder, Scott Heiferman, had imagined it would be of greatest interest to people with hobbies or a shared passion for a cult movie like ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show."" Little did he know that it would also be adopted by grass-roots activists meeting to strategize how to help the Dean campaign. In fact, Meetup was so little known that at first, Dean staffers themselves had no idea that people were using it on his behalf. It wasn't until Dean and his campaign manager, Joe Trippi, went to a New York City Dean Meetup in early 2003 -- and were stunned to find hundreds of people lining the street -- did they understand the power of the platform. ""They built our organization for us before we had an organization,"" Dean later told Wired magazine. The number of participants in Dean Meetups ultimately peaked at about 143,000, spread over about 600 locations -- a huge number in those days -- and engagement in the face-to-face local groups dramatically affected how involved volunteers got with the campaign. The more Meetups people attended, the higher their average donation to the campaign, for example. According to an academic study by Christine Williams and Bruce Weinberg of Bentley College, people who reported going to just one Dean Meetup reported giving $154 on average. People who went to five or more gave $510. The more Meetups that people attended, the greater their likelihood to tell other people to learn about, volunteer for and, ultimately, vote for their candidate. Today, Meetup is a growing, profitable company that is about to celebrate two major milestones: Soon, 100 million people will have RSVP'd to more than 10 million individual Meetups, worldwide. But the site is no longer a hub for presidential politicking -- at least not in the conventional sense. There are just 71 groups on the site devoted to supporting President Obama, and the numbers for Mitt Romney, Michele Bachmann, Rick Perry and Newt Gingrich are all in the low single digits. Herman Cain has 10. Only Ron Paul, who has long had an outside-the-establishment message and following, is big on Meetup, with more than 700 groups and about 88,000 members using the site to connect. This shift is understandable. We shouldn't really expect to see hundreds of local Meetups for a presidential candidate at this point in the process, for three reasons. First of all, the Republican campaigns are all essentially focused on just the first few states to hold caucuses and primaries. Anything that doesn't get them votes or volunteers in Iowa or New Hampshire is a distraction. And second, with the exception of Paul, none of these candidates -- including Obama -- have succeeded in creating anything like a movement behind them in this cycle. Dean attracted supporters from all over America because Democrats in early 2003 were hungrily searching for a candidate who was anti-war and appeared electable. No issue is currently uniting Republicans in quite the same way. But there's a third reason why we're not seeing Meetup and presidential politics line up the way they did eight years ago. Politically inclined grass-roots activism on both the right and left is alive and well on Meetup in the thriving number of tea party and Occupy Wall Street groups using the site. And they're looking for changes that are much bigger than anything offered by either Republican or Democratic candidates. As Meetup founder Heiferman describes in this talk I filmed of him, given Monday to an audience of foundation and nonprofit types in New York, the tea party was, in some ways, born on Meetup. ""Glenn Beck went on TV, and he said ... 'go to a Glenn Beck Meetup in your town.' They created a Glenn Beck Meetup in about 500 towns ... and they all tagged themselves 'tea party.' ... And they are some of the most active Meetups we see on our system,"" he said. People are not only organized town-by-town, but ""they help each other out if one of them has cancer."" More than 700 tea party groups are now active on Meetup, with nearly 100,000 members. Now, the Occupy movement, which is only about a month old, is taking off on Meetup as well, with more than 2,400 ""Occupy Together"" communities on the site. There's an important clue here about how the Internet will affect the politics of 2012. As outside-the-establishment movements like the tea party, Occupy Wall Street and Ron Paul followers are showing, the two-party system isn't big enough to absorb the concerns and passions of hundreds of thousands of grass-roots activists. And these are the people who, despite being a minority of the larger population, can drive the agenda in new directions. So while we shouldn't expect a platform like Meetup to make any presidential candidate a viable challenger the way it did in 2003 and early 2004 with Dean, it (along with other online platforms and social networks) is helping do something even bigger: It is enabling Americans to create quasi-third parties that are bringing new voices and new issues into the national debate. And in a country where the differences between the two major parties are sometimes hard to find, that can only be a good thing for democracy.","Meetup.com played a strong part in the 2004 campaign of Democrat Howard Dean .

"Ever wanted to see who would win in a fight between Nintendo's Mario and Sega's Sonic? Now you can in Super Smash Bros. Brawl, a cartoon fighting game for the Nintendo Wii. 'Brawl' lets you pick your favorite video game character and spar against your best friend over the internet. As with the previous games in this popular series - 1999's Super Smash Bros. on the Nintendo 64 and 2001's Super Smash Bros. Melee on the Nintendo GameCube - this new Wii brawler lets you duke it out with and against popular Nintendo mascots such as Mario, Link, Pikachu, Donkey Kong, Bowser, Wario and Zero Suit Samus, each with their own unique moves, abilities and special power attacks. But the latest version - which sold more than 1.4 million units in the U.S. in the first week after its launch March 9 - also lets you fight against characters from other popular video games including Solid Snake from Konami's Metal Gear Solid and Sonic from Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog, as well as other Nintendo favorites such as Ike (from Fire Emblem ), Wolf (from Star Fox ), Diddy Kong (from Donkey Kong Country ) and Meta Knight (from the Kirby games). Having all of these familiar and beloved characters in one game is a treat, not to mention it's fun to unlock all the fighters by winning matches - as not everyone is available right from the get-go. Depending on the mode you select, the game plays out as follows: You and a friend can select which character you'd like to play as and then pick a desired venue from the nearly two dozen choices. It's a last man - or beast - standing scenario, as you will fight, jump and block until one character falls off the edge of the screen. At the end of the round a winner is declared. That's the gist of it, but the many moves you can execute per character keeps things fun and frantic - and with lots of colorful eye candy, too. Special moves include Yoshi's Super Dragon Smash (where the little green dinosaur can shoot fireballs), Wario's nasty Gas Attack (which releases deadly fumes out of his buttocks) and Diddy Kong's Rocketbarrel Barrage (where the monkey takes flight and shoots peanuts out of dual wooden pistols). Also new to the series is online play, so you can play against friends on another Wii in another city. It works surprisingly well, especially considering the somewhat choppy Internet connectivity in Mario Strikers Charged. Plus, there's a lengthy story-driven adventure mode called ""The Subspace Emissary,"" which is essentially a full game. Super Smash Bros. Brawl is also fully customizable, allowing you to tweak everything from the character's special powers, weapons and moves to the musical score to how the game is controlled (whether you prefer Wii Remote, Wii Remote and Nunchuk, Classic Controller or the GameCube controller). This eagerly anticipated Wii game is great fun for those new to the franchise or long-standing followers. Its pick-up-and-play accessibility also makes it perfect for players of all ages - that is, if you don't mind the cartoon violence and somewhat crude humor, such as Wario passing gas.

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Shiite Houthi rebels have overrun a tribal stronghold in northern Yemen after weeks of fighting that has left scores dead, tribal leaders said Sunday. Leaders of the Sunni Hashid tribe said Houthi fighters managed to break through their defense lines in the al-Khamri district in Amran. ""Al-Ahmar tribesmen were surrounded by hundreds of Houthi militants who attacked using heavy artillery for seven continuous hours starting last night,"" said Ali Al-Suraimi, a leader within the Hashid tribe, referring to Hashid tribal leaders. ""Hundreds of additional Houthi fighters reinforced those attacking the al-Ahmar fighters. They easily outnumbered the al-Ahmar tribesmen and this was key for the Houthis' success on the ground."" He said the Hashid tribesmen had evacuated their stronghold on Sunday morning. ""The Hashid tribes are expected to regroup, and this is far from over,"" Al-Suraimi said. Another Hashid tribal leader echoed this. On Friday, at least 42 people were killed and more than a dozen injured in clashes between Houthi militants and Hashid fighters in Amran province, which is about 30 miles north of the capital, Sanaa, and seen as a linchpin to controlling the region, officials said. President Abdurabu Hadi has dispatched a committee to discuss a cease-fire with Houthi leaders and persuade them to leave the area, according to state-run media. Cease-fire talks . Cease-fire negotiations were already under way to put an end to the fighting that has plagued Yemen since late last year, spurred in part by a power vacuum left by the departure of former President Ali Abdullah Saleh. Tensions between the rebel Houthis and the Hashid tribe, which includes Sunni tribesmen and conservative Islamic Salafists, began to rise last October, when the Houthis blamed the Hashid for standing behind the killing of one of their members. At least 240 people from both sides have been killed since the beginning of January in the fighting. Hundreds of civilians have evacuated their towns in Amran. Yemen is home to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, believed by many analysts to be the most dangerous affiliate of the terror network. Separately on Sunday, Yemeni officials said armed tribesmen kidnapped a German national in Sanaa. Kidnapping has long been a problem in Yemen, with tribes often using foreign nationals as bargaining chips in their dealings with the central government. But the past 24 months have proven even more dangerous for foreigners. CNN's Roba Alhenawi and Marie-Louise Gumuchian contributed to this report .","Shiite militants have been battling Sunni tribesmen in northern Yemen .

"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- Inside a half-empty lecture hall at the American University of Beirut, Maryam Alkhawaja explains her cause. ""The thing about Bahrain is that nobody really knows what's going on there because there's not much media coverage,"" Alkhawaja said during a recent visit. ""But the protests never stopped."" At just 26, the young woman is already one of her country's most outspoken rights activists, and she's on a mission: to make sure ""that people across the world, not just the Arab world, across the world, are hearing about what's going on the ground."" To carry out that mission, Alkhawaja -- who has dual Bahraini and Danish citizenship, and is the acting president of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights -- lives in exile and travels the world explaining how her people are oppressed. Back in the auditorium, her audience is small, but extremely attentive. ""Every single day,"" Alkhawaja says, ""between 15 to 25 different areas come out to protest in Bahrain. Every single day."" Those demonstrations began in February 2011, at the height of the Arab Spring. Bahraini citizens, spurred by successful uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt, demanded democratic reforms and other changes in the way the country was run. Anger from the majority Shiite population was directed at the ruling Sunni minority. But Bahrain's uprising failed to gain the traction of other regional revolutions after a crackdown by authorities in the tiny island state, backed by troops from nearby Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Demonstrators say authorities killed dozens of people and arrested, tortured and imprisoned hundreds of others. Opposition leaders have tried to keep the protest movement alive. For Alkhawaja, the cause continues. She says her countrymen and women will not be silenced, despite the odds they face. ""When you're talking about human rights, it's black and white,"" she says. ""There's no excuse for committing human rights violations."" Alkhawaja accuses Bahrain's government of committing violations on a daily basis, and says her organization exists in part to document those abuses. The government denies the claims, saying it has implemented tough penalties for those who incite what it calls ""terrorism."" In a statement, the Bahraini government says it has implemented reforms and set up independent bodies to address grievances. ""We would also like to make it very clear that Ms. Al-Khawaja's personal misguided view that 'Bahraini citizens are oppressed' is not representative of the broad consensus, nor of the opposition front,"" the statement said. The government also acknowledged the country's ""challenging past"" and said remedies are under way. ""Since the release of the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry (BICI) report in 2011, Bahrain has made a commitment to address all grievances, as well as well reform the institutional landscape to ensure historical errors are not repeated. In regards to grievances pertaining to any accusation of mistreatment, independent bodies have been established to investigate and address any incident of misconduct that may undermine public confidence in the Ministry of Interior (MOI), even if no formal complaint is filed."" Read full government statement . This kind of sparring is nothing new to Alkhawaja, who was literally born into this line of work. She comes from a well-known family of dissidents. Her father, Abdulhadi Alkhawaja, was sentenced to life in prison for his role in anti-government demonstrations and plotting to overthrow the country's royal family. Many rights groups have called him a prisoner of conscience. Her sister, Zainab Alkhawaja, is also a very prominent rights activist, and also currently locked up -- having been sentenced to prison for, among other things, insulting the police. It can all get to be too much, which is why Alkhawaja says she has to detach. ""Part of doing this work is teaching yourself to depersonalize all of the cases that you deal with,"" she explains. ""When I talk about Abdulhadi Alkhawaja the political prisoner and the torture victim, or the torture survivor, I don't talk about Abdulhadi Alkhawaja, my father, who I shared my childhood with -- I talk about Abdulhadi Alkhawaja, the person who is known to Bahrain and is known to the cause."" ""When I talk about Zainab Alkhawaja, you know, being separated from her three-year-old child, I'm not talking about my sister and my niece,"" adds Alkhawaja. ""I'm talking about Zainab Alkhawaja the Bahraini citizen."" Over the past two years, Alkhawaja has become somewhat of a celebrity in the world of human rights activism, and not just in Bahrain. Regularly invited to conferences around the world, she finds her platform growing every day -- with more than 94,000 Twitter followers. She was even named one of Foreign Policy Magazine's Top 100 Global Thinkers in 2012. She seems happy to address anyone willing to listen. Still, she says, it's never easy. ""The thing with being a human rights defender is that it's always accompanied with guilt because no matter what you do, you feel you're not doing enough."" Which is why Alkhawaja is always connected -- either online or on her phone, no matter where she goes -- reviewing claims, making cases, tweeting updates. She was in Lebanon for only a few days, but never stopped addressing audiences both digital and physical, large and small, urging the world to listen to the stories of the oppressed, one voice at a time.","Maryam Alkhawaja was born into a family of activists .

"(CNN) -- Bahrain says an American teacher posted and tweeted items that incited ""hatred"" against the government and the royal family and has booted her out of the kingdom. The Ministry of Communications said the teacher was deported for her ""activities linked to radical opposition groups,"" as well as violating the terms of her work permit by working as an unaccredited journalist. While the government did not name the teacher, the Bahrain Center for Human Rights identified her as Erin Kilbride. The ministry said she published a number of articles for online journals, including one it says is linked to Hezbollah. ""We cannot have someone teaching impressionable young children who supports an internationally recognized terrorist organization like Hezbollah,"" said the principal at the school where the woman taught, according to the Bahrain News Agency. Kilbride wrote an article critical of Bahrain's crackdown on dissent for the website Muftah. The article hinted at hypocrisy by some Gulf countries for supporting revolutions -- as long as it's not in their own backyard. Muftah lists Kilbride on its staff page as the co-editor for its Yemen and Gulf States section. The teacher's expulsion comes as Bahraini opposition groups gear up for a mass protest set for Wednesday. Tensions in the kingdom remain high after a 2011 uprising in which the majority Shiite population protested against the ruling Sunni minority. The protests were spurred by uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt. But the demonstrations failed to gain the traction of other Arab Spring uprisings after a crackdown by authorities in the island state, backed by troops from nearby Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates under the banner of the Gulf Cooperation Council.","NEW: A human rights group identifies the teacher as Erin Kilbride .

"Chapel Hill, N.C. (CNN) -- Margo Balboni is cramming college into three years to cut down on the cost of her student loans. As it is, the University of North Carolina sophomore expects to graduate in a few years with $20,000 in debt. ""I try not to think about it too much,"" said Balboni, ""The last thing I want is to be financially dependent on my parents."" Balboni is scared of the student loan bills she may face when she graduates in a few years. But come July, millions of college graduates may see their payments jump. That's when the interest rate on federally subsidized college loans is set to double. Unless Congress decides to freeze current interest rates, the more than 7 million Americans will see their annual rates jump from 3.4% to 6.8%. Just the thought of that, said Balboni, ""definitely makes my anxiety go up several notches."" The issue is fast becoming a political football, and one President Barack Obama hopes to score with young voters. But his likely Republican opponent is trying to take the ball off the field by also supporting the freeze. Romney camp: Why we will get the young people . This week, Obama begins an all-out push for Congress to extend the low rates on these loans. ""We can't make higher education a luxury,"" he said during a rally in North Carolina Tuesday. ""It's an economic imperative. Every American family should be able to afford it."" That message is red meat to the college crowd, a group the president has to energize in big numbers before November. In 2008, the president won two-thirds of 18-29 year olds. Sen. John McCain won 32%. That year young voters made up one-fifth of the electorate. That may not sound like a large enough voting block to decide an election but, on the state level, young voters can make a big difference. In North Carolina during the last election, Obama won by just 1%, or 14,177 votes. But he carried the state's young voters by an overwhelming 74%. The youth vote clearly helped provide a cushion for his upset victory and the state's 15 electoral votes. Since then, the dynamic has changed. Youth turnout dropped 6% between the 2008 presidential election and the 2010 midterms. Though a drop off in turnout among young voters is predictable when there's no presidential candidate on the ticket, there are other reasons the Obama team has to worry about a lower turnout. Young people have been hit especially hard during the recession, with more than half of recent college graduates unemployed or underemployed. And a recent Harvard University Institute of Politics survey showed that while young people still overwhelmingly support Obama, they are now less likely to vote this fall, more disillusioned about the economy and politics in general. ""It's not too late for Obama to relight some fires,"" said Hodding Carter, Public Policy Professor at UNC. ""I do not think it's possible for him to ignite the kind of conflagration in the entire youth that he did last time."" Carter believes young voters are easily disillusioned by the gridlock in Washington. They ""essentially looked up and said 'but it didn't work right away so the hell with it.' And that's always a problem with the youth vote."" Student loan rate hike: What you need to know . So the president is now stepping up his effort to appeal to young voters. This week he's visiting college campuses in states he carried in 2008 and those that will be in play in 2012 -- North Carolina, Colorado and Iowa. He is pushing the ""keep-college-loans-affordable"" message and pointing the finger at Republicans. His speech in North Carolina included an attack on a Republican congresswoman for her position on student loans. He didn't mention her name but the president recounted the comments of Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-NC) who had told a talk radio host that she had ""very little tolerance"" for students who graduate with large amounts of debt. ""Can you imagine that?"" the president asked the crowd, which responded with loud boos. What he doesn't mention is that Romney came out this week in favor of extending a freeze on the current interest rates. ""With the number of college graduates who can't find work or who can only find work well beneath their skill level, I fully support the effort to extend the low interest rate on student loans,"" Romney said before a campaign event in Astor, Pennsylvania on Monday. Romney is making a play to dampen enthusiasm for the president among young voters. At the Pennsylvania event he told reporters, ""I think this is a time when young people are questioning the support they gave to President Obama three and a half years ago."" One issue the Romney campaign is certain to hit on: the unemployment rate among 20-24 year olds is five points higher than the national average. In his comments on the youth vote, Romney added, ""He (the president) promised a future with good jobs and good opportunity; that hasn't happened."" But it may be in the administration's interests to keep the subject in the headlines, continuing to suggest that the Republicans will stand in the way of a deal. It will cost the United States $6 billion to extend the student loans for just one year, according to the Congressional Budget Office. John Kline, the Republican chairman of the Education and Workforce Committee, has called it an ""untenable situation"" in which ""we must now choose between allowing interest rates to rise or piling billions of dollars on the backs of taxpayers."" Kline said he is working to find ""a responsible solution"" -- a way to pay for an extension of the freeze. On Tuesday, Obama attacked Congress for continuing subsidies for oil companies and for its failure to increase taxes on the wealthy, leading the crowd to chants of ""no!"" to questions such as ""Do we want tax cuts for the rich?"" The current interest rate reduction passed with bipartisan support in 2007, but Republicans have pointed out that then-Sen. Obama missed two votes on the issue. The White House has pointed out the president was campaigning at the time and was prepared to return to cast his ballot if needed for the vote; then-Sen. Joe Biden and Sens. Chris Dodd and John McCain also missed the vote. The back and forth in Washington is seen as just more noise to the students who face a rate increase on July 1. Balboni, the UNC sophomore, said her biggest fear is the possibility she'll be so deeply in debt, she'll have to move into her parent's home after graduation. ""Yeah it's the 800-pound guerilla in the room. It's everyone's plan Z. Nobody wants to go all the way to that.""","College grads face student loan rates that could double if Congress doesn't act .

"London, England (CNN) -- Britain's Prince William and his bride-to-be Kate Middleton, returned to the scene of their early romance Friday, visiting St. Andrews University in Fife, Scotland. As patron of the university's 600th Anniversary Appeal, Prince William officially launched the event, viewing the surviving Papal Bull -- a series of letters issued by the pope in 1413 -- and unveiling a plaque in front of students and staff. Prince William, who is second line to the British throne, studied art history at St. Andrews when he first met Kate in 2001. The pair grew closer after moving into a shared house with two other friends and were said to have started dating in late 2003. They both graduated in 2005. ""Catherine might be a bit emotional today,"" said CNN royal contributor Mark Saunders. ""She came here (St. Andrews) as just as a normal student and she comes back today as a woman who will one day sit on the throne of England. ""This university claims it has the most student marriages of any university in Great Britain. My theory is, this is such a small town that there really isn't anything else to do but fall in love."" As a wedding present to the couple, the university has established a new scholarship in honor of its two graduates. ""We were very pleased to make the offer of this scholarship as a wedding gift... and absolutely delighted that they have graciously accepted,"" university principal and vice-chancellor Louise Richardson said in a statement. It is the second official engagement for the couple, who launched a lifeboat in Anglesey, north Wales yesterday. The pair currently resides in Anglesey while Prince William serves as an RAF search and rescue helicopter pilot. Their first official engagement was said to be deliberately low-key, in order to ease Middleton into royal life.","Prince William and Kate have returned to St. Andrews University .

"Rome (CNN) -- Pope Benedict XVI appointed six new cardinals in a special ceremony at St. Peter's Basilica on Saturday, all of them from countries outside Europe. One of those elevated to the College of Cardinals was American Archbishop James M. Harvey, who currently serves as prefect of the papal household, according to Vatican Radio. The others were Bechara Boutros Rai, a Maronite patriarch from Lebanon; Baselios Cleemis Thottunkal, an Indian archbishop and head of the Syro-Malankara Church; Archbishop John Olorunfemi Onaiyekan of Abuja, Nigeria; Archbishop Ruben Salazar Gomez of Bogota, Colombia; and Archbishop Luis Antonio Tagle of Manila, Philippines. During the ceremony each received the traditional red hat, or ""biretta,"" gold ring and a document with the name of the cardinal's titular church in Rome. The red of the cardinals' hats is viewed as symbolic of the ultimate sacrifice they would make if required, that is, shedding their blood for their faith. More religion news on CNN's Belief blog . The pontiff's address focused on the diversity of the church and how it belongs to all the world's peoples, according to Vatican Radio. ""What makes the Church Catholic is the fact that Christ in his saving mission embraces all humanity,"" he is quoted as saying. ""Situated within the context and the perspective of the Church's unity and universality is the College of Cardinals: it presents a variety of faces, because it expresses the face of the universal Church."" The College of Cardinals was established in 1150. Its main role is to advise the pope and pick his successor. The new cardinals are all reportedly younger than 80, meaning they could play a role in picking the next pope. Once a cardinal reaches 80, he is no longer able to participate in the election of the pope or enter the secret conclave where cardinals gather when the time comes to select the next pope, typically upon the prior pope's death. The pope appointed another 22 cardinals in February. Of those, a majority were European, with a handful from further afield. They included New York Archbishop Timothy Dolan, Baltimore Archbishop Edwin F. O'Brien and Toronto Archbishop Thomas Collins, as well as the Bishop of Hong Kong, John Tong Hon, and Major Archbishop George Alencherry from India.

"(CNN) -- Egypt's army chief Gen. Abdel Fattah el-Sisi said Saturday that he would run for president if the Egyptian people wanted him to, state media reported. El-Sisi, the country's defense minister, said that ""If I run for presidency, it would be by the request of the people and by a mandate from my army, as we work within a democracy,"" according to the official MENA news agency. El-Sisi's words come as Egypt prepares to hold a referendum Tuesday and Wednesday on a new constitution that would ban religious parties and put more power in the hands of the military. If the constitution is passed, elections should follow. El-Sisi also called on people to participate in the referendum. The country has seen months of political turmoil since its first democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsy of the Muslim Brotherhood, was deposed by the military in July and an interim, military-backed government was installed in his place. Detractors said he was a tyrant trying to impose conservative values, but Morsy's supporters say that the military has returned to the authoritarian practices of longtime ruler Hosni Mubarak, who was deposed in a popular uprising in 2011. Hundreds died in clashes between Egyptian security forces and Morsy supporters in the weeks which followed his ouster. Many in the Muslim Brotherhood hold el-Sisi, as the military chief, responsible for the bloodshed. In a statement issued amid the crisis, el-Sisi said ""Egypt has room for everybody, and we are keen to save every drop of Egyptian blood."" He added, ""The Egyptian people are free to choose whoever to govern them, while the armed forces will remain the safeguard of the will of the people and of their choice."" Morsy has been in detention since July and faces trial on charges of inciting the murders of at least three protesters outside the presidential palace in late 2012.The protests were over a constitution that Morsy shepherded into effect. The second session in the trial is due February 1, after a hearing last week was postponed when bad weather prevented Morsy from being brought by helicopter to court. Morsy has said he doesn't recognize the court's authority, claiming he still is Egypt's legitimate President. Muslim Brotherhood members have continued their protests, even though the government declared the group a terrorist organization last month. The government has threatened to arrest anyone who attends Muslim Brotherhood protests or provides financial support to the organization.","Egypt's army chief Gen.

"Guatemala City, Guatemala (CNN) -- A Guatemalan judge Thursday declined to grant former dictator Efrain Rios Montt amnesty from genocide charges, paving the way for a trial. Montt's defense team had filed a motion seeking amnesty last week. The judge argued that the country's 1996 National Reconciliation Law, which coincided with the end of the country's civil war, does not guarantee amnesty for those accused of human rights abuses. Secondly, the judge said, Guatemala is party to international treaties that obligate it to prosecute crimes of genocide. Rios Montt ruled Guatemala from 1982 to 1983. He came to power in a coup and led a military junta while Guatemala was in a bloody civil war between the army and leftist guerrillas. The war did not end until 1996, leaving more than 200,000 people dead and 1 million as refugees. Prosecutors argued that Rios Montt was aware of the repressive strategies that the military was using against anyone suspected of being a guerrilla, such as killings, forced disappearances and kidnappings, the state-run AGN news agency reported. The human rights abuse and genocide allegations against him come from his ""scorched earth"" campaign to root out insurgents in provinces heavily populated by indigenous populations. He is accused of being responsible for the deaths of more than 1,700 Mayan residents. During his rule, there were massacres in these provinces in which, according to the Guatemalan truth commission, between 70% and 90% of some villages were razed. The commission found that during this and other periods of the civil war, there were also reported cases of rape, especially of Mayan women. Journalist Maria Renee Barillas contributed to this report.","Efrain Rios Montt will face a genocide trial as planned .

"Rome (CNN) -- Pope Benedict appointed 22 new cardinals at the Vatican on Saturday, with his choices for the lofty role likely to influence who will be appointed as the next pontiff. The Vatican named the new cardinals last month, but they were officially inducted by the pontiff in a special ceremony at St. Peter's Basilica. Among those to be elevated to the College of Cardinals are New York Archbishop Timothy Dolan, cementing his standing as the top Catholic in the United States, and Archbishop Edwin F. O'Brien of Baltimore. Others include Archbishop Thomas Collins, from Toronto, as well as the Bishop of Hong Kong, John Tong Hon, and Major Archbishop George Alencherry from India . Senior clerics from Germany, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Romania and Brazil are also represented, as well as several from Italy. The College of Cardinals was established in 1150. Its main role is to advise the current Pope and pick his successor. ""This is the most exclusive club in the Catholic Church,"" said John Allen, CNN's Vatican analyst. ""In many cases, you also become, at least informally, a candidate to be the next pope, because the next pope will almost certainly come from the roughly 120 cardinals under the age of 80."" Once a cardinal reaches 80, he is no longer able to participate in the election of the pope or enter the secret conclave where cardinals gather when the time comes to select the next pope, typically upon the prior pope's death. The new cardinals each professed their faith and swore an oath of obedience to Pope Benedict and his successors during Saturday's ceremony, called the Consistory, at the Vatican. They then walked one by one to the pontiff and knelt in front of him to receive the traditional red hat, or ""biretta,"" and gold ring, and a document with the name of the cardinal's titular church in Rome. In his address, Benedict said that in joining the College of Cardinals, the clerics would ""be united with new and stronger bonds not only to the Roman Pontiff but also to the entire community of the faithful spread throughout the world."" Emphasizing the importance of service over self-interest, the pontiff said the red of the cardinals' hats was symbolic of the ultimate sacrifice they would make if required. ""The new cardinals are entrusted with the service of love: love for God, love for his Church, an absolute and unconditional love for his brothers and sisters, even unto shedding their blood, if necessary, as expressed in the words of placing the biretta and as indicated by the color of their robes,"" he said. Pope Benedict also announced seven new saints, including the first Native American saint, a 17th-Century Mohawk woman called Kateri, or Catherine, Tekakwitha, who was a Catholic convert. Existing members of the College of Cardinals and the new cardinals-elect came together for a day of prayer and reflection Friday, in preparation for the ceremony, according to the Holy See Press Office. Dolan addressed the gathering on the subject of evangelization, saying there was a need to challenge a growing secularization of society.

"(CNN) -- Andrew Dawson has nice hands, and he knows it. He's fussy about moisturizing them and takes extra caution around the oven, although he uses power tools without hesitation. These hands are the stars of ""The Articulate Hand,"" a piece of performance theater about how various people's hands have become impaired and what effect that's had on them, both practically and psychologically. It's a collaboration between Dawson and neuroscientist Dr. Jonathan Cole, and supported by the Wellcome Trust. ""I mix up performance and lecture and basically talk about human stories,"" Dawson says. ""It just happens that I'm using my hand as a vehicle, but really I'm talking about what it is to be human."" In the show, which he hopes to perform again this year, he talks about various people who have lost complete use of their hands and demonstrates to the audience, through his own body's movements, what these people's lives are like. ""I am looking for that unique balance between science and art, so that medial practitioners and researchers learn something about the work they are doing from a new perspective, without feeling that the performance is 'not for them,' Dawson said. ""And that the art audience in turn learn something about their very structure, of what it takes to be a human without confusing them with science. "" In October at TEDMED, a gathering of notable researchers, thinkers and other professionals in the health care space, Dawson performed a few powerful segments of ""The Articulate Hand."" For one portion he takes on the movements of Debbie Graham, a woman who injured her spine when she dove into a swimming pool, glided across it and hit the wall. Graham broke her neck, and is quadriplegic as a result. Graham received bionic hand technology called the Freehand System, which involves electrodes under her skin connected to a receiver driven by a radio transmitter on the skin. In this way, moving her shoulder backwards and forwards makes her hand open and close. Cole wrote about Graham in a book called ""Still Lives: Narratives of Spinal Cord Injury."" ""She can hold her fork herself or a brush and brush her hair, and that's what gives her what she desires the most, and that's independence,"" Dawson says. Dawson and Cole met after Dawson saw the neuroscientist's documentary about a man who cannot sense the relative position of his own joints and limbs. The pair worked together on a piece called ""Process of Portrayal,"" which deals with experiences of people who are paralyzed, or for whom movement is difficult. Recognizing Dawson's ""extraordinary hands"" and artistic talent, it made sense for Cole to focus on that for their subsequent collaboration. ""Human hand function really reflects the evolution of the movement and creative [areas of the] brain, and one way to reflect on how we are defined by our hands is to look at the consequences of loss of function,"" Cole told CNN. ""So our next project had to be about the hand and neurology."" Cole explains on ""The Articulate Hand"" website that there are parts of the brain called the motor and sensory cortex areas that are critical for the hand's coordinated action, as well as sensation that helps you to act -- for instance, when you reach into your pocket for coins, and you have to feel and grasp them in order to pick them up without seeing them. He supplied the scientific insights and the patients that inspired ""The Articulate Hand."" Cole and Dawson also created short videos with the patients so that people can see what they are like in real life, in addition to Dawson's portrayal. ""We never pathologize the conditions but rather show you individual people living with their altered hands, so asking the audience to look beyond the problem to the person,"" Cole said. The show has been performed in the United Kingdom in 2010 and at the World Science Festival in June 2011. Dawson took it to India last year also at a Wellcome Trust event. He is exploring multiple possibilities for 2012. Dawson started out wanting to be an actor, and then got interested in dance, studying with the legendary dancer and choreographer Merce Cunningham. He also studied theater in Paris. His interest in mime illusions started at 16 or 17, but he credits that more to his imagination than to his hands. Besides ""The Articulate Hand,"" he's also created and performed ""Space Panorama,"" which depicts the Apollo 11 moon landing with Dawson's hands alone, and a hand-based dance performance called ""Quatre Mains."" He's also a hand model. If you want to try your hands at this sort of performance, Dawson has this advice: keep them moving, and keep them agile. ""There's a lot of bones there. You have more bones in hands and feet than you have in whole of the rest of your body. You need to keep them supple.""","'The Articulate Hand' is a piece of performance theater about living with impaired hands .

"(CNN) -- Two University of Florida police officers were placed on leave with pay after using an electronic stun gun to subdue a student who was questioning Sen. John Kerry at a campus forum, the school's president said Tuesday. Student Andrew Meyer is surrounded by university police in Gainesville, Florida, on Monday. But the student's behavior and past activities are prompting questions about whether the incident was part of a stunt. The Florida Division of Law Enforcement will investigate Monday's arrest of Andrew Meyer, said University of Florida President J. Bernard Machen. Machen called the incident ""regretful for us."" ""The thing that I regret is that civil dialogue and civil discourse did not happen,"" Machen said. ""That's fundamental to a university campus. Why it didn't happen is what we're trying to sort out."" During Monday's forum, Meyer came to the microphone to question the 2004 Democratic presidential nominee from Massachusetts.  Watch the incident unfold » . ""You will take my question because I have been listening to your crap for two hours,"" Meyer told Kerry, according to the police report of the incident. He then turned to a woman and said ""Are you taping this? Do you have this? You ready?"" the report said. Clarissa Jessup, who contributed I-Report video of the incident to CNN, said Meyer gave her his camera and asked her to shoot video of him posing his questions to Kerry. Organizers had cut off questioning before Meyer went to the microphone, she said. Watch Jessup describe the incident . Meyer asked Kerry why he did not contest his loss to President Bush in the pivotal state of Ohio over allegations that African-American voters were disenfranchised. Meyer also questioned Kerry about why he did not support impeaching Bush and whether he belonged to the Yale University secret society Skull and Bones, as Bush did. One of the police officers on the scene observed that Meyer was ""yelling as loud as he could as to sensationalize his presence,"" according to the police report. Meyer had about a minute and a half at the microphone before police stepped in to haul him away. As he tried to escape their grip, Kerry protested, ""That's all right, let me answer his question."" But as Meyer repeatedly questioned why he was being arrested, officers dragged him to the back of the auditorium and then used a Taser on him when he continued to struggle. While Kerry pleaded for calm, officers warned the student he would be shocked if he did not stop resisting. Meyer responded, ""What did I do? Get off me ... get the f--- off me, man, I didn't do anything. Don't Tase me, bro, I didn't do anything."" Police noted that his demeanor ""completely changed once the cameras were not in sight"" and described him as laughing and being lighthearted as he was being driven to the Alachua County Detention Center. ""I am not mad at you guys, you didn't do anything wrong. You were just trying to do your job,"" Meyer said, according to the police report. At one point, he asked whether there were going to be cameras at the jail, according to the report. Meyer was charged with resisting arrest with violence -- a felony -- and a misdemeanor count of disturbing the peace. He was released without having to post bond Tuesday. Machen said the clips posted online paint an incomplete picture of the scene. Watch the university's reaction . University spokesman Steve Orlando said before police moved in, Meyer was asked to relinquish the microphone because he was ""being disruptive."" But the arrest triggered a protest by a group of University of Florida students Tuesday. One of them, Benjamin Dictor, called the arrest ""an assault on reason itself."" ""For a question to be met with arrest, not to mention physical violence, is completely unacceptable in the United States,"" Dictor said. Some students cheered Meyer's removal, and others looked on quietly. But several screamed in protest when officers prepared to shock him. Meyer was carrying a business card advertising ""TheAndrewMeyer.com 'Speak My Mind,' "" the police report said. The Web site features videos of Meyer taking part in several practical jokes. It also includes a ""disorganized diatribe"" that criticizes the war in Iraq and the media. The Web site said his friends had posted coverage of his arrest. In a statement issued Tuesday, Kerry said he didn't know a Taser had been used on the student until after he left the event, and said he hoped no one was injured. ""In 37 years of public appearances, through wars, protests and highly emotional events, I have never had a dialogue end this way,"" he said. ""I believe I could have handled the situation without interruption, but again, I do not know what warnings or other exchanges transpired between the young man and the police prior to his barging to the front of the line and their intervention."" Machen said authorities have not determined whether Tasers were used improperly. In addition, he said a student-faculty review panel will examine ""all of our protocols relative to student dialogue and faculty interaction"" in the wake of the incident. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- There's an old saying in golf -- ""beware the injured golfer."" Well, on this occasion it was the sick golfer who came out on top on the opening day of the Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill, Orlando. Adam Scott, who had been suffering with flu-like symptoms, tied the course record Thursday after carding a 10-under 62 to move into a three-shot lead. ""It takes your mind off (golf),"" Scott told reporters after being asked about feeling under the weather. ""The expectations lower, slows you down and almost takes your mind off what's going on, because you're not even feeling human sometimes. ""I went out there today just trying to get the ball around. (I feel) pretty ordinary."" Scott, the reigning Masters champion, may have felt ordinary but his golf was anything but as he produced a magical first round. The Australian hit two eagles and seven birdies on his first appearance at the tournament since missing the cut in 2009. ""It's maybe a little surprising,"" added Scott after being asked about his impressive start. ""I don't know where it came from, but the putter certainly got hot today. ""But I like the changes they've made since the times I have not been here. And today was just one of those days where the hole was a bit like a bucket."" Japan's Ryo Ishikawa and American John Merrick share second place after both finishing with rounds of 65.

"(CNN) -- Ivorian artist Paul Sika is no ordinary photographer. His ""one-frame films"" are eye-catching explosions of color, falling somewhere between cinema and photography. The influence of the big screen is obvious in Sika's photographs, which resemble stills from an ultra-stylish, slightly surreal movie shot in glorious Technicolor. ""The style of photography I have I call photomaking,"" he told CNN. ""It's influenced by cinema -- I call it one-frame filmmaking. ""Behind these photos, what you have is imagination at the beginning, then you have a script that I write, and then you have a cast and crew. We rehearse when needed and then we go and shoot. After that I do the post production."" Completely self taught, Sika, 24, only took up photography after returning to the Ivory Coast in 2006, having been inspired by an experience he had while he was a student in London. ""I was just walking down Tottenham Court Road, a road known for its computers and electronics shops, and at some point I saw a trailer for ""'Matrix 2: Reloaded',"" Sika told CNN. ""I was impressed and from that moment on I wanted to experiment and do those kinds of beautiful things."" Stars shine at African Oscars . The oversaturated, vibrant colors in his work are the result of extensive post production, using Photoshop. Sika is at home working in the digital medium having studied software engineering at university, and his dynamic style has won him work on advertising campaigns for Ivorian fashion labels. His work is also gaining recognition overseas, having been exhibited in New York and featured on U.S.-rapper Kanye West's blog. But Sika is keen not to limit himself to just one medium. Describing himself as a ""creative entrepreneur,"" he has just published a book of images and text called ""At the Heart of Me,"" and is looking for partners to help him branch out into fashion, perfume, and online computer games. But for now it's his photographs that are grabbing people's attention. More than just eye candy, Sika's images tell complex stories about Africa. One striking photo shows two men using small bags of water to put out a blazing fire. It's an image rich with symbolism. ""It's basically about the personal and collective struggle and the perseverance we show when we get towards a common greater good,"" Sika told CNN. ""The fire can be understood as the problems in life. The small water bags can be the small means you have to get out of these problems. ""So these youthful people you see are creative enough to use the small means they have to get out of the big problems they're encountering."" It's this kind of positive portrayal of Africans, free of cliches and stereotypes, that Sika says is central to his work. ""You have great people everywhere,"" he told CNN. ""I've been very bent on showing positivity, happiness, hope, in ways that are not just flattering, but in ways that are real.""

"(CNN) -- The hospital emergency room is the front door of the health care system. Most people will only have to visit a handful of times in their lives, but visiting an ER can be both a lifesaving and frightening experience. However, several myths prevail about what happens in the ER and what you can expect. Here are five that need to be declared DOA. Myth: The ER is not like TV . Actually, television shows like ""ER"" and even ""Scrubs"" do not stray far from the truth. While it's not like television all the time, the ER can be an exciting and dangerous place, as seen in many episodes. In fact, emergency nurses are frequently attacked, verbally and physically, by patients. A 2007 survey of more than 3,000 emergency room nurses found that more than half the nurses surveyed had been spit on, hit, pushed or shoved, scratched or kicked by patients. About a fourth of nurses said they had experienced more than 20 of these types of episodes over three years. However, I've seen many of these same nurses chase and retrieve confused patients when they wander away. We handle these incidents with levity while in the trenches, but the truth is that the ER can be a very violent place to work, and there are few reporting mechanisms for these attacks. While drugs, alcohol and mental illness play a role in many incidents, this provides little solace after being assaulted in your workplace. If and when you come to the hospital, bringing empathy for the nurses and staff goes a long way. Myth: Patient satisfaction is our No. 1 priority . Everyone is entitled to a courteous visit to the emergency room just as you are entitled to a courteous visit to Burger King. However, if you order a shrimp taco at a burger restaurant, you can't have it, no matter how upsetting this may be or how much you may want it. We probably won't be able to diagnose a skin rash that's been present for three years, nor can we tell you exactly why your knee hurts if it's not broken. The ER is designed to identify and treat time-sensitive conditions. As a patient, your only legal entitlement is to a medical screening exam, which essentially is for conditions that need to be remedied quickly in order to save your life. A 2012 study published in Journal of the American Medical Association showed that higher patient satisfaction scores are associated with higher health care expenditures and higher mortality. Patients frequently enter into the emergency department expecting antibiotics for the common cold or a CAT scan of the head. They equate patient satisfaction with ""customer satisfaction."" While it's very trendy to say so, patients are not exactly customers. Physicians have a fiduciary role to maintain, as most of us know what can kill humans and are ethically and legally bound not to administer it. In many emergency departments, you may be able to demand more tests, but you should know that receiving them may not always be in your best interest. Myth: Obamacare will make my ER more crowded . The real answer about how crowded a single ER will become this year is dependent on a lot of regional factors such as the number of primary care providers and the privileges of physician extenders (such as nurse practitioners and physician assistants) in a given state. I work in one of the busiest emergency departments in the country. We were busy in 2012, 2013, and we will probably be just as busy in 2014. If people think they have an emergency, they come to the ER. Research has shown that most patients who come to the ER believe they have a life-threatening condition. Also, a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association showed huge overlap in the initial ER complaints of people with ""primary care treatable"" (could have seen their doctor) conditions and those with truly emergent complaints. Any med student knows that chest pain from something as simple as acid reflux can be indistinguishable from that of a heart attack. The people who are in the ER with you, Obamacare or not, will likely believe they have an emergent condition. Myth: I shouldn't let the doctor put me in observation . Actually, observation units are awesome. About a third of U.S. hospitals have them. These are dedicated patient care areas, typically staffed with emergency physicians, that are designed to rapidly treat or diagnose a handful of conditions like pneumonia, asthma, and chest pain. In hospitals without these units, patients with relatively simple conditions may be spread throughout the hospital. Patients in observation units generally stay between 16 and 24 hours. These dedicated areas have shown superior outcomes compared to traditional care in terms of length of stay, missed diagnoses and mortality. Further, as reported in Health Affairs, these units are so efficient that if they were instituted in the other two-thirds of hospitals, they would save our health system billions. Unfortunately, there have been reports of senior citizens being placed in ""observation status"" and having received hefty bills from hospitals because of it. There was even a class action lawsuit against the Centers for Medicare and Medicare Services alleging that hospitals use ""observation status"" to punish seniors by making them responsible for more of their bill. Even though this case was dismissed in 2013, media outlets occasionally show stories of seniors who have large hospital bills related to ""observation status,"" further perpetuating this myth. The reality is that while the issue remains very complex, the vast majority of Medicare receiving seniors (94%) pay less under ""observation status"" than if they were admitted under ""inpatient status,"" according to the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General. Myth: The ER is first-come, first-served . We do not go in order of arrival time. We use the tried-and-true triage system where sicker patients are seen first. Trust me when I tell you that you don't want this any other way. If your loved one is shot in the face, you would want them to be seen first. You cannot and will not be in control of the order of patients seen. No one in the emergency department has made an appointment. The national average length of stay for an ER patient is about five hours. During this stay, we can often obtain testing that would generally take you months to receive. Americans who are acutely ill actually visit their personal physician a minority of the time. As Emory University physician Dr. Stephen Pitts described in Health Affairs, emergency medicine physicians see 28% of these acute visits, but make up less than 5% of the physician workforce. I and many other practitioners of emergency medicine chose this specialty because of the ""help anyone, anytime, anywhere"" aspect of the job. When you come to the ER, be prepared for some of the best medicine our health care system has to offer. This is not a jail; everyone is free to leave if they are unsatisfied with the wait or availability of services, but rest assured, we will be happy to see you at any time for any complaint. The opinions expressed are solely those of Dr. Anwar Osborne.","Visiting an ER can be both lifesaving and frightening .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- Director Woody Allen pulled his latest film, ""Blue Jasmine,"" from movie theaters in India because the country's laws require an anti-smoking ad every time a character lights up on screen. The movie, starring actress Cate Blanchett as a troubled New York socialite, was due for release in India this month. Indian distributor PVR Pictures confirmed to CNN that it would not longer be releasing the movie in the country. ""We have to abide by the law of the land. It's fine,"" said Deepak Sharma, PVR chief operating officer. The film, written by Woody Allen and also starring actor Alec Baldwin, went on general release in the United States in August. A representative for Woody Allen said the film was pulled because of the Indian Ministry of Health's requirement that an anti-smoking warning be shown when any smoking scene is aired as part of a movie. Allen's films sometimes feature smoking prominently.","Woody Allen's latest movie, ""Blue Jasmine,"" will not be screened in India .

"(CNN) -- Manchester United captain Nemanja Vidic has announced that he will leave the club at the end of the season. The 32-year-old Serbian has enjoyed eight hugely successful seasons at Old Trafford but now says he wants a fresh challenge away from the English Premier League. ""It's the last year of my contract and I have had eight wonderful years here. My time at this great club will always rank as the best years of my career,"" Vidic said in a statement released on Manchester United's official website. ""I never could have imagined winning 15 trophies and I will certainly never forget that fantastic night in Moscow, memories that will live with me and the fans forever. ""However, I have decided that I will move on at the end of this season. I want to challenge myself again and try to make the best of myself in the coming years."" In addition to the 2008 Champions League victory over Chelsea in the Russian capital, Vidic won five English Premier League titles, three League Cup winner's medals and one FIFA Club World Cup. The former Serbian International has played over 200 games for United and forged a formidable defensive partnership with Rio Ferdinand following his transfer from Spartak Moscow in December 2005. According to his agent Silvano Martina, Vidic has been the subject of interest from several Serie A clubs including Inter Milan and the defender confirmed that he is not looking for a contract at another English club. ""I'm not considering staying in England as the only club I ever wanted to play for here is Manchester United and I was lucky enough to be part of this club for so many years.

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer extended his winning run to eight matches on Monday with a hard-fought victory over Russia's Dmitry Tursunov in the third round of the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells in California. The Swiss, who is seeking a fifth singles title at the tournament, snuck through in straight sets 7-6 7-6 in one hour, 45 minutes. Victory for 32-year-old Federer sets up a clash with either Germany's Tommy Haas or Kei Nishikori from Japan who play later on Monday. The world No. 8 received a bye in the first round before dispatching France's Paul-Henri Matheiu in straight sets in round two following on from his triumph in Dubai at the beginning of the month. In the other early match played Monday, Andy Murray needed three sets to beat Jiri Vesely of the Czech Republic. The Scot also labored in victory over Lukas Rosol in round two but eventually prevailed against world No. 77 Vesely 6-7 6-4 6-4. Murray, who underwent back surgery last September, has yet to find his best form since returning to action in December and again looked ring-rusty against the big Czech. The world No. 6 -- an Indian Wells finalist in 2009 -- dropped serve six times against Vesely but eventually won through in two hours, 48 minutes. ""Whether it was the beginning or the end, it was that sort of match where at no stage did either of us play well at the same time,"" Murray said. ""I started the match well, he started off the match badly. He missed a lot of easy shots, and then he started playing consistent, not making errors, and I started missing. ""It's good to have the chance to play another match here and hopefully put in a better performance.""

"(CNN) -- A movement urging Verizon to get rid of wireless contracts appears to be gaining steam. A petition calling for the carrier to end contracts for smartphones and ""create an affordable way for consumers to purchase their devices"" had attracted more than 60,000 signatures by Wednesday morning on Change.org, the online petition platform. Mike Beauchamp, a Verizon customer and blogger from Wichita, Kansas, said he started the Change.org petition 11 days ago after he heard Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam say he'd consider killing cell phone contracts if consumers asked for it. ""I believe that people should have the freedom of choice ... to move freely between carriers,"" Beauchamp told CNN in a phone interview. ""I think that model where you tie customers in for two or three years is a tired model that doesn't need to exist anymore."" For years, most wireless carriers have subsidized the high cost of smartphones -- often $600 or more -- by requiring customers to sign long-term contracts. Customers who try to switch carriers before their contract is up often face hefty penalties -- up to $350 for Verizon customers, according to the carrier's early-termination policy. But T-Mobile shook up the wireless industry last month by announcing it would revamp its pricing models to eliminate contracts. Instead, T-Mobile's new service plans require that customers pay for their smartphones either up front or in monthly payments over two years. Beauchamp's petition urges Verizon to follow T-Mobile's lead and get rid of contracts for wireless service. Change.org put the petition on its homepage Monday after it received more than 7,000 signatures on Saturday alone. A spokesperson for Verizon would not comment specifically on the petition. ""Verizon Wireless has for years offered many different choices for customers, including contract plans or month-to-month plans that do not require a contract,"" said spokeswoman Debra Lewis in a prepared statement. Verizon Wireless does offer its phones without a contract as well, but requires the consumer to pay the full price of the phone upfront. For instance, a 16GB iPhone 5 costs $200 with a two-year contract but $650 without a contract. AT&T and Sprint offer virtually identical pricing. Beauchamp said he's hoping Verizon will agree to reduce or eliminate early-termination fees for existing customers and lower prices on phones sold without contracts. He said Monday he hadn't heard from the carrier since he launched his petition.","A petition urges Verizon to follow T-Mobile's lead and get rid of contracts for service .

"Tuscaloosa, Alabama (CNN) -- Leveled buildings, fallen trees and massive piles of rubble stretched across wide swaths of the South after destructive tornadoes and severe storms tore through the region. By early Friday, the death toll from the wave of powerful storms that struck Wednesday and early Thursday was nearly 300 people in six states. In the city of Tuscaloosa alone, at least 36 people lost their lives. Officials scrambled to assess the damage as doctors treated hundreds of injured. Dazed residents wandered the streets, telling harrowing tales of devastation and survival. Employees huddled in a windowless break room at a CVS drug store in Tuscaloosa as a tornado approached and a deafening roar filled the air, store manager Michael Zutell said. A mother cradling an infant sprinted inside just before the twister hit. ""Glass is breaking. The woman with the baby is screaming. Part of the drop ceiling fell and boxes fly in,"" he said. No one inside the store was injured, Zutell said. ""It's mind-boggling to think you walked away."" Nurse Rachel Mulder said she and her husband rode out the storm in the bathtub of their second-floor apartment in Duncanville, Alabama. After the tornado passed, only their bathroom was standing. ""My husband was walking around, looking for survivors and called me over and said ...'Come here, someone is dying.' So I grabbed my first-aid kit and ran down the stairs to try and help her,"" she said. ""I tried to stop her bleeding and save her, but she was taking her last breath."" Bill Dutton found his mother-in-law's body hundreds of yards from the site of her Pleasant Grove, Alabama, home, which was swept away down to the foundation. ""The last thing she said on the phone, she was taking shelter in a closet,"" he said. Reba Self frantically searched for her mother after a tornado pummelled their home in Ringgold, Georgia. ""I'm screaming for her, 'Answer me, Mom -- please, Mom, answer me.' I didn't hear anything. It turns out she had gotten out of the house and walked around to the basement door, and she asked me if I was OK."" Now, they're trying to make the best of the situation. ""I'm laughing at her because she's in the house with a broom, sweeping. I told her, 'Mom, the house is gone, you can put the broom down,'"" Self said. The widespread devastation in areas across the South left residents reeling Thursday. ""It looks like an atomic bomb went off in a straight line,"" said Dr. Brian Wilhite, an internist at Druid City Hospital in Tuscaloosa who tended to the wounded. The facility was overrun with hundreds of people who suffered injuries, including head injuries or lacerations, he said. ""It looked more like a Vietnam War site than a hospital,"" Wilhite said. ""I know one physician who watched two people die right in front of him. There was nothing he could do."" A video shot from the third floor of the University of Alabama's basketball coliseum shows a large mass sucking everything into forbidding dark clouds above. Christopher England, who recorded the video, said the tornado looked like a movie scene. ""It was unreal to see something that violent and something that massive,"" he said. Tuscaloosa Mayor Walter Maddox estimated that the destruction spanned a length of five to seven miles, and was a mile wide in some areas. The challenges facing the city were daunting. The mayor said they were short on manpower, materials and equipment. The lifelong resident of Tuscaloosa said the damage was unlike anything he had seen before. ""I don't know how anyone survived,"" he said. CNN's Wayne Drash, Reynolds Wolf, Mariano Castillo, Matt Cherry and Martin Savidge contributed to this report .","Nearly 300 are killed across the South, and dozens are killed in Tuscaloosa, Alabama .

"Jarkarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- The marriage lasted four days and ended in divorce via text message, from the 40-year-old local politician to his 17-year-old wife. Aceng Fikri claimed his young bride Fani Oktara was not a virgin, as she had claimed, so he decided to end the union, his lawyer Ujang Suja'I said. She denied it, and in turn accused Aceng -- who is the head of the district of Garut in West Java -- of spreading baseless accusations against her. Her lawyer Danny Suliwisjaya told CNN that Aceng had deceived his client into marriage. Read more: Divorce attorneys catching cheaters on Facebook . Aceng caused a stir after his July wedding to Fani. Although 16 is the legal age for marriage in Indonesia, Aceng was already married with children. Few Muslims practice polygamy, and while it is not against the law, Indonesian civil servants are also prohibited from taking on second spouses under strict regulations governing their private lives. A photo of the alleged wedding ceremony was posted on the Internet. Religious weddings are common in Indonesia but marriages need to be civilly and legally registered. Aceng claimed divorcing his wife through text messaging is allowed under Islamic Sharia law, his lawyer said. Public outrage over the marriage, and subsequent divorce, came after Fani reported Aceng to the police on Monday, asking that he be charged with falsifying his marital status, fraud, defamation and unpleasant conduct.

There have since been daily protests in Garut, calling for his resignation. The girl's lawyer, Danny Suliswijaya, told CNN she and her family decided to go public only after months of asking Aceng for an apology. Suliswijaya said Aceng told Fani that he was a widower. ""He said he married Fani as his only wife, so he cheated and failed to tell the truth,"" Suliswijaya said. The lawyer claims Aceng also reneged on promises to send her to university and to the minor Hajj in Mecca. The embattled official apologized late Monday but stood by his version of the story. ""If what I did was wrong, even though it was allowed by Islamic law, then I deeply apologize to my family and my ex-wife,"" he told reporters. Ujang told CNN they will report Fani and her family to the police, seeking charges of fraud and extortion. ""Aceng accused her of not being a virgin on the second day of their marriage and she didn't deny it. That's why Aceng decided to end the marriage and send her back to her parents,"" Aceng's lawyer said. Fani's attorney insists the accusations are baseless. According to his lawyer, Aceng gave the girl's family 43 million rupiah (roughly $4,000) for her university fees and the minor Hajj trip. He says the girl's family agreed to the settlement but continued to contact Aceng for more money, ""blackmailing the district head."" Fani's attorney denies Aceng's claims, and says all his client wanted was an apology. Indonesian President Susilo has ordered the Home Affairs Ministry to summon Aceng and investigate the matter. On Wednesday, Garut's local legislative council also decided to create a special committee to look into Aceng's case. Read more: Fighting sex trafficking in hotels, one room at a time . His lawyer said the case needed ""to go through legal channels,"" and that his client's potential removal as district chief was not imminent: ""the council has to wait for the results of the police investigation before making a decision on Aceng's dismissal."" Women and children's rights activists, however, welcome the investigations and the public outcry over the case. Muhammad Ihsan, secretary of the Commission for the Protection of Indonesian Children or KPAI, told CNN the regent head may be held liable for a sexual offense, if it is proven that the regent head deceived the teenage girl. The commission says human trafficking, the illegal sex trade and the exploitation of women are rampant, particularly in the province of West Java. In not a few cases, parents or relatives give up their teenage daughters for marriage, in exchange for money. Ihsan said that when the facts of this case become clearer, it could highlight well-known and common practices of exploiting young women. ""If a public official is allowed to get away with behavior like this, then the public will think this is acceptable,"" said Ihsan.

"(CNN) -- Former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez is being investigated by a Massachusetts grand jury for possible gun trafficking, a source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN on Monday. The news comes one day after Massachusetts State Police served one of Hernandez's former college teammates, Mike Pouncey, with a subpoena related to the investigation, sources confirmed to CNN. After the Patriots defeated the visiting Miami Dolphins 27-17 at Gillette Stadium, police officers in suits gave Pouncey, a center for the Dolphins, a piece of paper in a hallway between a locker room and the Dolphins' bus, Sports Illustrated first reported. The gun trafficking investigation deals with illegally transporting weapons across state lines and, in part, involves the discovery of an assault-style rifle hidden in a vehicle rented in Florida and later found in Massachusetts, according to a separate law enforcement source. CNN requested comment from the Dolphins, the NFL, the Massachusetts State Police and the district attorney's office prosecuting the Hernandez cases in Bristol County, Massachusetts. Representatives from each declined to comment. Hernandez, 23, was charged in August with first-degree murder in the June shooting death of his friend Odin Lloyd. The grand jury investigating the allegations of gun trafficking is the same one that handed up the murder charge, a source said. Pouncey, 24, has not been charged in any possible wrongdoing and was asked to appear as a witness. He and his twin brother, Maurkice, both attended the University of Florida with Hernandez. After Hernandez was arrested in June after the execution-style killing of Lloyd, a photo of the Pouncey brothers at a night club wearing baseball caps that read ""Free Hernandez"" was posted on Twitter July 14. Maurkice Pouncey, a center for the Pittsburgh Steelers, later posted a statement, apologizing and saying it ""made light of a serious situation."" According to Sports Illustrated, a Steelers spokesman declined to comment when asked whether Maurkice Pouncey had been served. The Steelers will play at Gillette Stadium on Sunday. Hernandez was arrested in late June, 10 days after authorities say Lloyd, a 27-year-old semi-pro football player, was killed in North Attleborough, Massachusetts. Authorities have said that Hernandez, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz picked Lloyd up from his Boston apartment in a rental car shortly before he was found shot to death on June 17 in an industrial park not far from Hernandez's home. Hernandez pleaded not guilty in September to a charge of first-degree murder. Wallace and Ortiz have pleaded not guilty to charges of being an accessory to murder after the fact. Hernandez is also under investigation by a different grand jury in Boston looking into the unsolved 2012 double homicide of Daniel Abreu and Safiro Furtado outside a Boston nightclub.","Source: Grand jury that handed up murder charges considers gun trafficking allegations .

"(CNN) -- A day after a report documented that many New Jersey homeowners hit hard by Superstorm Sandy were wrongly denied aid, the state announced that it will reopen the appeals process for those ""initially deemed ineligible"" for funding. Richard E. Constable III -- commissioner of New Jersey's Department of Community Affairs -- said in a statement Friday that those turned down for government money through either the Reconstruction, Rehabilitation, Elevation, and Mitigation (or RREM) program or for a Homeowner Resettlement grant will now have another chance to make their case. ""We want anyone who is eligible under the guidelines to have a full and fair opportunity to receive assistance,"" Constable said, adding that applicants will receive a letter outlining how to appeal. This came after a report issued Thursday by the Fair Share Housing Center, an organization that advocates for the rights of poor homeowners. Public records obtained by the advocacy group show that 3,196 applicants were told by the Gov. Chris Christie's administration that they were ineligible for the program, which provides up to $150,000 to cover the cost of rebuilding and elevating a home. Of the 1,033 who appealed the denial, 788 -- or 79% --- were told they were, in fact, eligible for recovery funds . A similar percentage of residents who were denied up to $10,000 to cover non-rebuilding costs also had their rejections overturned in the appeals process. The report shows that a majority of the applicants overall who were denied funds were minority homeowners. ""We were pretty shocked,"" said Adam Gordon, staff attorney at Fair Share Housing Center. ""Thousands of people were wrongfully rejected, and it was impacting people all over the state. We were just shocked by the sheer magnitude of it."" Superstorm Sandy caused major devastation throughout New Jersey and neighboring states when it struck the U.S. mainland in late October 2012. That includes ravaging many communities along the Jersey Shore such as Seaside Heights. The Fair Share Housing Center report came at a critical point in the recovery effort in New Jersey. The state is preparing to distribute $1.46 billion in a second round of Sandy funding. At the same time, the U.S. Attorney's Office is investigating claims from Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer that members of the Christie administration linked Sandy recovery funds to her approval of a real estate development project in her city. CNN's Kristina Sgueglia and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","Those ""initially deemed eligible"" for post-Sandy funding will get another chance .

"(CNN) -- At least two people have been killed and 300 others injured in riots that erupted across Algeria amid rising food prices and a housing crisis, state-run media said Saturday. The protests began earlier in the week over spiraling costs of basic food items, including milk, oil and sugar. Some staples are subsidized by the government. Trade Minister Mustapha Benbada said food prices were on the agenda for a Saturday meeting between lawmakers, state-run Algerie Press Service reported. ""I think we are beginning to contain this crisis and we want to find a solution early next week,"" Benbada said in a statement. Similar protests, some violent, have erupted in neighboring Tunisia, where at least four people have died. Human rights groups have said the Tunisian government has cracked down on demonstrators with force. Reporters Without Borders condemned the arrests and disappearances of bloggers and online activists across a number of Tunisian cities. The worldwide press freedom organization said police arrested the bloggers to question them about hacking into government websites. One of those arrested was Hamadi Kaloutcha, who who has not been heard from since his arrest at 6 a.m. Friday, the group said. U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said Washington was monitoring the situation in both countries. The Tunisian ambassador was summoned to the State Department. ""We are concerned about demonstrations that have occurred over the past few days in Tunisia,"" Crowley said. ""They appear to us to be the result of ongoing social and economic unrest. We, obviously, want to see restraint on all sides. ""The people of Tunisia have the right to exercise free -- public assembly."" he said. ""And we have conveyed our views directly to the Tunisian Government."" He said the United States was also concerned about the reports of cyber intrusion and was urging everyone -- from the government to activists -- to respect freedom of expression. Crowley said it was ""difficult"" to say whether the protests in Tunisia were related to those in Algeria. ""We're not going to say that there's kind of an overlapping dynamic across the two countries,"" he said. ""But we continue to review this and both engage the government in Algeria and as well as look after the safety of our own citizens."" A national soccer league in Algeria has canceled matches scheduled for Friday and Saturday after riots in the capital and elsewhere this week. The matches were canceled in an effort to prevent large groups of young people from gathering, a local newspaper, Al Watan, reported. The protesters have been mostly young men who have broken into buildings and burned tires on the streets. Adding fuel to the protesters' anger are the high rates of unemployment and housing issues, socio-economic problems that have been festering for some time. The government has blamed the rising prices and other issues on the global economic crisis.","The protests erupted earlier in the week amid rising food prices .

"(CNN) -- Ahh, yes, February 15, the joyful day when singletons can finally collapse in exhaustion after weeks of maintaining a nonchalant front. Finally, you think, finally, the incessant stream of hearts and cupids and reminders that romantic partnership is the apogee of human achievement will come to a merciful end. And then you voluntarily read to the second paragraph of our weekly netiquette column, silly! That's right, we're here to take you waist-deep into that cesspool of romantic endeavors and bad decisions: online dating. Because if you survived yesterday single, you might be gunning to circumvent a repeat performance in 2013 (i.e., another year of you listening to Alanis Morissette and sobbing softly in your bedroom or, conversely, having a faux-peppy who-needs-men night with your gal pals, swilling salmon-colored drinks and shooting hateful glances at the couples in the bar). And if you're in a relationship right now, don't rest on your laurels quite yet: Breakups spike right after Cupid's big day, according to unofficial Facebook data, so you just might be back on the market soon. We've told you what not to do with your first message to a prospective date. We've told you what not to do with your photo. Yet real, live online daters continue to find bizarre and almost impressively original ways to turn us off. Read on for three totally boneheaded online dating moves we've actually encountered (AKA, weird things no one warns you about when they're persuading you to make a Match.com profile). Watching you on the street . ""Not to be creepy, but ..."" began an actual first message from an actual online dater. ""... were you sitting on a bench at such-and-such intersection at about 6:15 last night? I'm not hitting on you, I just like to think of online dating as a city-wide game of Guess Who."" Yes, we were at said corner, and we were unaware we were being watched by a peeper on the street. The incredible thing is not that said dater recognized a human from the site -- in an urban area, where folks are bumbling around in their own overlapping circles, of course you'll spot people whom you recognize from their profiles. The key is to not acknowledge it in a creepy way. (A clue that you're not adhering to that guideline: You begin a message with, ""Not to be creepy, but ..."") In this instance, for example, if the dude wanted to go on a date, he could send a friendly first message (not mentioning the unwitting run-in). Then, if things were rolling along after a few dates, he could mention it in a fun, ""You won't believe how serendipitous this was!"" kind of way. Or if he couldn't wait that long, he could send a cute Missed Connections-style message: ""I think I walked by you in Union Square yesterday! Your purple peacoat was stunning. I see you're a big fan of 'Parks & Recreation' -- have you checked out 'Party Down'?"" But just announcing, apropos of nothing, that he has superior facial recognition skills? Kind of weird. A friend told a tale of a girl he'd been messaging who eventually stopped responding. A few weeks later, a new note in his inbox: ""Hey, were you at the Caveman concert last night?"" (Indeed, he had been. Without the benefit of knowing a girl was watching him like Mel in Flight of the Conchords). If she was loving his vibes in person, she certainly could have walked up to him in between sets and said hello. But since she'd already dropped the message volley like a hot potato, probably best to let sleeping dogs snore. Another friend stopped messaging with a dude online when she got a weird feeling about him from his notes; a few weeks later, he spotted her at a Thai restaurant and marched right in. With apparent disregard for all social mores, he sat down at the table with her friends and asked when they could plan a proper date. The recommended course of action here is obvious: Since she had already rejected him online, he should've respected that and let the girl and her friends finish their pad thai in peace. Moral of these stories? Don't be scary. Online dating is nerve-racking enough when you're all squirmy-scared of rejection and awkward first-date conversations. Having to worry about weirdos jangling up to you at the supermarket? Not necessary. (Oh, and if you're the creep-ee: Block 'em on the site, or if they're approaching you in person, make an excuse and hightail it out of there. Safety first!) Revealing nothing about yourself . It's a strange power play, leaving your profile free from pictures and with only the pithiest write-ups; it says, ""You may need to advertise yourself like a heifer all gussied up for the state fair, but I ... I will make no attempt to sell myself to you. Instead,"" it tacitly blathers on, ""I will decide whether you look interesting enough for me."" Maybe that works for some people (probably those seeking the weakest and most damaged goods). Our take: Having an online dating profile and leaving it totally unpopulated just makes you look like you have no good qualities to trumpet. Oh, and sending along a photo with your first message? Still silly. How come everyone else has to show their cards from the start, while you get to keep yours close to your chest? It reeks of insecurity, a gross, musky smell reminiscent of Axe Body Spray and tears. Choosing a stupid user name . A recent German study found that people with ugly names have less success on online dating sites. Researchers came to that conclusion by tracking profile views on a gloriously German-looking dating site where users go by their real first names. But thank God you live in a country where you're free to pick your JDate handle! So why, why, why would you pick something ugly (MoldyBill) or embarrassed sounding (JustBrowzin228)? There are so very many cards stacked against you in finding love (see: a montage of your February 14), so pick a simple username, write an honest profile, and pray to the good god Eros for better luck next year.","Breakups spike right after Cupid's big day, according to unofficial Facebook data .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- The Israeli military launched airstrikes in northern and central Gaza early Sunday, said spokesmen for the Israel Defense Forces and Hamas. The Israeli spokesman said the military targeted a ""terror-activity center"" in northern Gaza and a ""weapons manufacturing facility"" in central Gaza. He confirmed direct hits on both targets. A security official for Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist movement that controls Gaza, said the northern strike hit an airfield that Hamas uses for military training. The second strike hit an old house in central Gaza, he said. The strikes were in response to an earlier attack on the Sha'ar Hanegev Regional Council, the Israeli military spokesman said. There were no immediate reports of injuries. The military said that more than 235 missiles, rockets and mortar shells were fired from Gaza into Israeli territory in 2010.","There are no immediate reports of injuries .

"(CNN) -- As football's January transfer window prepares to shut on Friday, clubs, players and agents are involved in a complicated game of roulette -- just who will blink first? For clubs, be they at the top or the bottom of the table, the window offers a final chance to either push them forward to title success or European Champions League qualification, or potentially rescue their top-flight status. There is an awful lot of money at stake as well as league position. In 2013, world governing body FIFA's Transfer Matching System handled 12,309 international player moves -- an increase of 4% on 2012 -- which were worth $3.7 billion, up a whopping 41%. Thanks to a bumper television deal worth $4.7 billion that is shared between the 20 Premier League clubs, England spent more than any other country on transfers in 2013 -- $913 million -- an increase of 51% over the previous year. That $913 million represents 25% of the global transfer spend. In the current 2013-2014 season English Premier League clubs have already spent over $1.3 billion on players, more than double the sum teams in Spain, Italy and France are investing in strengthening their squads, according to the authoritative Transfermarkt website. ""Intermediaries"" Traditionally January is viewed as a bad time to invest in players, given selling clubs always demand a premium. But that hasn't stopped champions Manchester United, struggling to qualify for next season's Champions League, signing Spain international Juan Mata for a club record $61 million from Chelsea. While English clubs spent lavishly, Brazil once again had the most number of transfers -- 1,402 -- for both incoming and outgoing players, testament to the 2014 World Cup host's knack for developing players. Often key to any transfer deal is the role played by what FIFA terms ""intermediaries,"" be they agents, lawyers or even parents. Last week Spanish club Barcelona revealed the deal to sign Brazil international Neymar cost $118 million, including a $66 million ""compensation fee"" paid to a company owned by the player's parents. According to FIFA, although there was an increase of 30% in club intermediary commissions paid in 2013, there was a decrease in the actual number of transfers involving such ""middle men"" -- only 14% compared to 17% in 2012. Last year's biggest transfer was Real Madrid's purchase of Wales international Gareth Bale from English club Tottenham. The BBC reported it was a world-record move worth $132 million that was greater than the $124 million fee Real Madrid produced to lure Cristiano Ronaldo away from Manchester United in 2009.","FIFA's Transfer Matching System handled 12,309 international player moves in 2013 .

"(CNN) -- In 1957 Bill Marriott was a 25-year-old former navy officer urging his entrepreneur father to give him a shot at revitalizing the family's first hotel, outside Washington D.C. Fast forward 55 years and as executive chairman of Marriott International, Bill Marriott has built a world-renowned, multi-billion dollar hotel chain. Back when Marriott got involved with the D.C. hotel the 365-room facility was an under-performing part of his family's business portfolio, which then primarily consisted of restaurants and food stalls. ""My father was a restaurateur and he didn't really understand the (hotel) side ... of the business,"" Marriott told CNN's Richard Quest. ""I started focusing on what would make this hotel successful,"" he added. ""All of a sudden, I figured out we'd make more money in the hotel business than we would ever make in the restaurant business."" In more than half a century in the industry, Marriott, now 80, has built a hotel empire of more than 3,700 properties. When it comes to changes in a fast-moving business, Marriott has seen it all. When he started out in the 50s, Marriott was a single brand. These days, the industry is characterized by segmentation, with hotel corporations producing ever-more niche brands. ""In 1981 we had a lot of big box city hotels ... someone said we are going to run out of great locations where we can build these hotels, we've got to do something to build the company -- let's go and build a hotel for the business man."" The result? In 1983 Marriott introduced its Courtyard brand. ""We built a 150-room Courtyard in the suburbs of Atlanta,"" Marriot told Quest. ""It was tremendously successful, so then we just started cranking out these Courtyards. They didn't have a lot of services -- limited restaurant menu, no bellman, no room service, no parking attendants -- but it was a low price for a great room."" See also: 9 best secret hotels in the world . The Marriott portfolio now comprises 18 different hotel brands, including Ritz-Carlton and Fairfield Inn, which target different types of traveler, be they businesspeople, families, or budget travelers. And he believes there's room for more brands. ""We've just added AC Hotels in Europe and Autograph Collection (a series of Marriott-owned independent hotels) two years ago ... so we've got a lot of stuff going on,"" he said. And whereas once it may have been enough to simply provide hotel guests with a clean, comfortable place to sleep for the night, today's customers demand more individual attention. ""If somebody asks the best place to have dinner, we know where that is,"" said Marriott. ""The best place to get an Armani bag? We know where that is. Where is the best place to go sightseeing? We are interested in taking care of your visit."" Marriott says the biggest change he has seen in the last 20 years is the focus on the international market. In 1969 Marriott opened its first international hotel in Acapulco, Mexico. It now has facilities in 73 countries and territories around the world. Marriott said he first realized the true importance of the international market when his company expanded into Asia. See also: Make the most of your Singapore stopover . ""We went into Hong Kong in 1989 ... I had a feeling we had to be in Asia, we had to be over there. There was growth coming,"" he said. ""I went to China in 1979 -- there was nothing but Mao suits on bicycles, no cars, everybody wore the same clothing -- but we could start to see glimmers of interest."" Today there are 171 Marriott hotels operating in Asia and a further 85 in the pipeline, mirroring the region's rise to economic prominence during the same period. Marriott highlighted one final change in the hotel industry over the last 20 years, one that reflects a huge change in society as a whole: the prevalence of technology. ""We continually fight the battle (for) more broadband, better access,"" he said. ""Technology is very, very important. Thirty percent of our reservations come through the internet. We are in the top eight or nine purveyors on the internet."" Marriott has recently stepped down as CEO and taken up the more hands-off position of executive chairman, passing on day-to-day control of the company to former president and COO Arne Sorenson. But Marriott's not about to give up all of his influence over the company he built. ""It's my life, it's my vocation,"" he said of his work over the last 55 years. ""I don't play golf, I don't have a yacht. I work and I visit hotels ... it's in my DNA,"" he said.","Bill Marriott first became involved in his family's hotel business in 1957 .

"(CNN) -- Two breath tests estimated pop star Justin Bieber's blood-alcohol content was below .08% after his arrest on suspicion of driving under the influence in Florida, a source close to the investigation said Friday. The tests indicated contents of .011% and .014%, the source said. Both would be below the general .08% legal limit for drivers and Florida's .02% limit for drivers under the legal drinking age of 21. Bieber is 19. It's not clear how soon after the arrest the tests were given. And an alcohol level by itself wouldn't necessarily clear a defendant of DUI, as Florida law also says people can be convicted if controlled substances -- not just alcohol -- impair the driver's ""normal faculties."" Police said Bieber admitted to drinking, using marijuana and taking prescription pills before his arrest early Thursday in Miami Beach. He also failed a field sobriety test, Miami Beach police said. Bieber was pulled over after a Miami Beach officer saw him driving a yellow Lamborghini in a race against a red Ferrari in a residential area of Miami Beach, city Police Chief Raymond Martinez said. Thursday's incident marks the first time the teen singer has been arrested, although he is the subject of a felony vandalism probe on allegations of egging his California neighbor's home. Officers suspended in Bieber escort probe . Bieber's arrest came three days after he arrived in the Miami area -- a visit that also has put the behavior of a separate police department's officers in the spotlight. Three Opa-Locka police officers have been suspended in connection with allegations that officers escorted Bieber's caravan early in the week, the city's manager said Friday. The city has been investigating reports that Opa-Locka officers escorted Bieber from the city's airport to Miami strip clubs Monday. Opa-Locka Deputy City Manager David Chiverton said the three officers would be suspended with pay, pending an investigation. Chiverton said he didn't know how the escort arrangement was initiated. The arrest . Bieber was pulled over just after 4 a.m. Thursday after a police officer saw Bieber and the other driver speeding at about 55 to 60 mph in a 30 mph zone, said Martinez, the Miami Beach police chief. The officer stopped Bieber's car, but the singer was ""was not cooperating with the officer's instructions,"" Martinez said. ""At first, he was a little belligerent, using some choice words questioning why he was being stopped and why the officer was even questioning him,"" he said. ""What the f*** did I do? Why did you stop me?"" Bieber asked the police officer who stopped him, according to the arrest report . He allegedly ignored a police officer's request to keep his hands on the car while he did ""a cursory patdown for weapons,"" the report said. ""I ain't got no f***ing weapons,"" the arresting officer quoted Bieber as saying. ""Why do you have to search me? What the f*** is this about?"" The arrest report describes Bieber as having a ""flushed face, bloodshot eyes, and the odor of alcohol on his breath."" Two black SUVs blocked the traffic at 26th and Pine Tree Drive, which ""facilitated an open road"" for the two cars to race on Pine Tree, the report said. Bieber was booked into jail after failing the field sobriety test, police said. Police said a urine test was taken; results are expected in two to three weeks. The Ferrari's driver, identified as 19-year-old Def Jam recording artist Khalil Sharieff, was also arrested on a drunken driving charge, police said. Bieber was released Thursday from a Miami jail an hour after he made a brief appearance through a video link before a Miami judge, who set a ""standard"" $2,500 bond that afternoon. CNN's Alan Duke and Jason Hanna and CNN en Espanol's Adriana Hauser contributed to this report.","Source: Tests indicated Bieber's BAC was .011%, .014% .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Cerebral. That's how I would describe the producer, songwriter, musician Pharrell Williams if I could only use one word. Yes, he's incredibly talented -- as co-founder of the production powerhouse The Neptunes, he and his partner Chad Hugo have netted hit after hit. They have worked with everyone from Britney Spears to Madonna. Justin Timberlake to Jay-Z. Most recently, Robin Thicke probably wasn't a name you would have been familiar with until you heard this year's biggest hit ""Blurred Lines"" featuring Pharrell. Yup, that was The Neptunes' doing. And don't forget about Daft Punk's ""Get Lucky"" the hit No. 2 on the Billboard charts and which Billboard described as ""the Summer Song of 2013"". It's just another part of the Pharrell phenomenon. If you want to know more about Pharrell, you only have to look as far as the manifesto he wrote on his website. He says, ""I serve and represent the OTHERS because I am one myself"". The ""others"" being anyone who has ever felt outside of the ""norm"", anyone who has ever felt they couldn't be categorized, anyone who has ever felt different. See who else has been on Talk Asia . It's often safer to be inside the proverbial box. But it takes guts to not only say that the box is too small, but to go out and create a whole other space to be free and thrive. And that's what Mr. Williams has done. For him, the internet is that space. It's a place where democracy rules but individuality reigns. Ironic since here is a guy who has succeeded where very few can. He has been accepted by the establishment in music, fashion, art and architecture. He has become the man everyone wants to work with. In the research process and through our conversation I saw Williams as more than ""the man of the moment"" but a man with cross pop cultural influence. He showed me a roadmap to a non-predictable professional life, one in which his career is custom-designed and climbs no particular ladder. He speaks of a ""collective conscience"" where a ""shift in humanity"" means there are no ladders. Instead, it's about seeking alternate horizons by designing your own life and your own path. Through his ""I Am Other"" initiative, (which is now the umbrella framework under which all his projects operate) Pharrell capitalizes on this shift by turning the consumer generation he influences into fellow entrepreneurs. He has created a forum where people can share and discuss ideas, thereby sealing his own position as a role model. He expresses his own ideas through music, movies, social media, and of course the internet. Williams calls it ""a customization era"" because ""people want what they want right now."" Williams credits his diverse career to a lifelong curiosity that his mother instilled in him. She taught him to be open to all that is around him. And he is. From conversations with the renowned neuroscientist Dr. Vilayanur S. Ramachandran and their discussions on the psychology of music to collaborations with the artist Takashi Murakami on a sculpture, Pharrell is a man who revels in cross-platform communication because for him, life is about maximizing existence in every way. For Williams though, the most important message he could share to his fans is his perspective on humanity --it is one in which we all have something to offer and it is our duty to our self-respect to live life on our terms. The goal then would be to find a way to serve humanity through our given talents. Williams shared with me the one thing that stuck with him that Ramachandran told him.

"(CNN) -- The leaders of Sudan and newly independent South Sudan inked a deal Thursday that will resume oil exports, but failed to address other key disputes between the recently divorced countries. The African Union and the U.N. Security Council had initially given Sudan's President Omar Al Bashir and South Sudan's President Salva Kiir one day to come to an agreement on several issues that have threatened to spark an all-out war between the two nations. The two leaders began talks Sunday in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa. In addition to restarting oil exports from South Sudan, the two presidents agreed on a demilitarized zone and principles of border demarcation. Yet they could not reach a deal on the status of Abyei, a disputed region claimed by both countries, which has been a contentious issue since the South declared independence on July 9 of last year. Speaking at Thursday's signing ceremony, Kiir said the agreement marked a great day for the two nations but called for a swift resolution to the question of Abyei's future, for the sake of its people. Al Bashir also welcomed the deal, saying it reflected a ""desire to achieve peace and stability and the mutual benefit"" of the two nations. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon praised both presidents for ""demonstrating the statesmanship that made a comprehensive agreement possible, and for having once again chosen peace over war."" More: Sudan's wanted president visits Egypt . Under the agreement, South Sudan will resume oil exports to Sudan, which controls the infrastructure through which the oil flows. South Sudan shut off its oil supply in January, saying that Sudan was stealing oil revenue. The South got around 70% of the formerly united country's reserves when it became independent last year. Both countries, especially South Sudan, have seen hyperinflation and a squeeze on incoming foreign currency, which has hurt their economies. The deal also set up a demilitarized zone along the two countries' border where the militaries of Sudan and South Sudan and other armed groups are not allowed. ""This agreement breaks new ground in support of the international vision of two viable states at peace with each other,"" President Obama said in a statement Thursday. The United States is prepared to work with both countries to resolve the outstanding issues, he added. The High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs, Catherine Ashton, also praised the deal, saying the security agreements will contribute to stabilizing the border area. The agreement did not address the status of disputed areas along the border and the fate of Abyei, critical security issues that must be resolved if the two countries are to have lasting peace. Those issues may be addressed in upcoming talks, according to South Sudan's spokesman Atif Kiir. ""For the border issues we had agreed that we are going to continue our talks and we are hopeful to reach an agreement for the peace and security of the two countries, for the peace of the two regions and for the international community,"" the spokesman said late Wednesday. Under a 2005 peace agreement that ended Sudan's two-decade civil war, Abyei residents were to take part in a referendum on whether to join the South or remain a special administrative region within Sudan. The vote was to take place in January 2011, at the same time as the referendum that led to South Sudan's secession. But disputes over who was eligible to vote prevented the referendum from going forward in Abyei. Sudan and South Sudan have been under increasing pressure from the African Union and Security Council to resolve the matter peacefully. More: Supermodel returns home to South Sudan . In April, Sudan and South Sudan slipped close to all-out war with a series of tit-for-tat air raids and ground attacks that prompted the African Union and Security Council to push the two sides to act. The Security Council had given the sides until Sunday to come up with a deal or face sanctions, but the negotiators said that deadline had been informally extended until the end of the talks.","The presidents of Sudan and South Sudan sign a deal on some points .
The two nations must still agree on the disputed territory of Abyei .

"Washington (CNN) -- Less than 100 feet from where a hijacked airplane slammed into the Pentagon, Muslim military personnel bring prayer rugs on weekday afternoons for group worship. On Fridays, a local imam conducts a service in the Pentagon Memorial Chapel built after the September 11, 2001, terror attacks by al Qaeda that killed 184 people at the U.S. military headquarters. The chapel, with stained-glass windows, burgundy carpeting and a wooden altar, provides a place of prayer and religious observance for anyone regardless of faith or culture. Its welcoming calm and nondenominational culture are in stark contrast to the emotional debate over plans to build an Islamic cultural center and mosque two blocks from ground zero in New York City, where planes flown by al Qaeda hijackers destroyed the World Trade Center, killing more than 2,700 people. To chaplains who work in Army chapels around the world, the tolerance and openness represent the support and camaraderie of military culture. ""What happens here is normal,"" said Chaplain (Lt. Col.) Carleton W. Birch, spokesman for the Army Chief of Chaplains. The Pentagon chapel opened in November 2002 as part of the reconstruction of the complex from damage caused by the 9/11 attack. Behind the altar, a large stained-glass display depicts the Pentagon, an eagle and the American flag, with a double row of 184 ruby-red glass pieces representing the victims killed when American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the building. ""United in memory, September 11, 2001,"" it reads. The chapel contains 80 seats and has regularly scheduled religious services on weekdays, including Catholic confession and Mass, a Jewish service and Torah study, a Hindu service, a Mormon service and services for other Christian denominations, along with the Muslim prayer service. On average, 300 to 400 people visit the chapel each week, either to take part in group services or on their own. Army officials interviewed Wednesday said they were unaware of anyone ever protesting against Muslims' use of the chapel. ""I've never had a question about it"" in four-plus years at the Pentagon, Army spokesman George Wright said. The Army culture of religious freedom dates back to the Revolutionary War, Wright said, describing it as ""a big tent."" ""We're very tolerant here of one another and our faith,"" he said. ""We don't keep track of who comes in."" CNN's Chris Lawrence contributed to this story.","The military chapel near the 9/11 crash site is nondenominational .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- When Tanya Rosenblit boarded an inter-city bus bound for Jerusalem from her native Ashdod Friday morning, she did not anticipate the storm it would spark within Israel. The public bus she boarded normally carries ultra-Orthodox passengers and travels to an ultra-Orthodox neighborhood in Jerusalem. As a matter of custom women sit in the back portion of the bus, because the ultra-Orthodox avoid mingling of the sexes according to their beliefs. She was the first passenger that morning on the bus and took a seat behind the driver. As the bus took on more passengers along its route, an ultra-orthodox man demanded she should sit in the back of the bus as is the custom on that route. ""I heard him call me 'Shikse,'"" Rosenblit wrote on her Facebook page, referencing a Yiddish term for a non-Jewish woman. ""He demanded I sit in the back of the bus, because Jewish men couldn't sit behind women (!!!). I refused."" ""This is my home town of Ashdod, I live in an Israeli democracy, people cannot tell me where to sit on a bus."" An argument ensued and ultimately the bus driver called the police to intervene, but not before a crowd of black-clad ultra-orthodox men had gathered outside the bus. ""I was starting to get scared, to tell you the truth,"" Rosenblit recalled. ""There were like 20 of them, all wearing black. Most of them were just curious, but they were definitely on his side."" Rosenblit snapped throughout this disruption, and said she was comfortable knowing that Israeli law was on her side. In a case brought by an Israeli woman earlier this year, the country's Supreme Court ruled that involuntary separation between the sexes on public buses was against the law. The responding police officer tried to talk to everyone and calm things down. Rosenblit said he asked if she was willing to show respect for the objectors and move to the back of the bus. She refused and, after a 30-minute delay, the bus moved on to Jerusalem with her sitting up front. A day after posting the account on Facebook, Rosenblit's story was picked up by the Israeli media, which has been devoting a lot of coverage to the public outcry over the growing political power of the ultra-Orthodox in Israel, and fears they are forcing the generally secular Israeli public to adopt their religious standards. Israel's largest circulation newspaper put her story on its front page with the headline, ""They Won't Tell Me Where to Sit,"" and compared Rosenblit to the American civil rights movement's legendary Rosa Parks. On Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu brought up her story in his weekly cabinet meeting. ""Up until this day we have agreed to live in peace with mutual respect by all sectors of the Israeli society,"" he told his government ministers. ""In recent days we witness attempts to break this coexistence apart. Today, for example, I have heard of an attempt to move a woman from her seat on a bus. I oppose this unequivocally. I believe we must not allow margins groups to break our common denominator and we must keep our public spaces open and safe for all of our citizens. We must find the uniting and mediating ground rather than the things that divide and separate us."" Netanyahu said. Rosenblit also received a call from Israel's opposition leader, Tzipi Livni, who offered her support and called her a symbol of determination against ""anti-democratic radicalization that pushes women away from the public space."" A spokesman for Egged, the transportation company that runs the bus line, told CNN in a statement that it ""does not deal with seating arrangements"" on its buses and that ""even if there are population groups that prefer to sit separately due to their beliefs, it is a voluntary choice and does not bind the other passengers."" Rosenblit describes herself as secular and said she did not ride the bus looking for a confrontation. She said what motivated her to write about her experience was not ""not to declare the Orthodox Jews as pure evil and the oppressors of human rights and liberties,"" but to point out what she sees as societal problem in Israel. ""There are a lot of lovely things about religion, but forcing people to choose religion is wrong,"" she said. ""It is wrong to use religion as an excuse to eliminate people's basic rights: the right for freedom and the right for dignity.""","Women sit in the back portion of the bus because ultra-Orthodox avoid mingling of sexes .

"(CNN) -- Gunmen abducted two American citizens along with their Filipino relative from a southern Philippines island Tuesday, police said. At about 3 a.m., 14 armed men snatched Gerfa Yeatts Lunsmann, 43, her son, Kevin, 14, and Lunsmann's Filipino nephew, Romnick Jakaria, 19, said Nonito Asbai, the area's police chief inspector. Police and the Filipino navy have launched search operations, Asbai said. The victims were forced at gunpoint to board awaiting boats, which then sped toward the troubled island of Basilan, a stronghold of the Islamic militant group Abu Sayyaf. No one, however, has claimed responsibility for the abduction or asked for a ransom. Jakaria's cousin, Alma Jakaria, said Lunsmann was adopted by Americans when she was 9 and grew up in Virginia. She married a German citizen and had her son, Kevin. Both she and Kevin are U.S. passport holders. Police suspect the son attracted attention because of his distinctive mixed-race looks in an area with few foreign tourists. The three were vacationing in Tictabon and were supposed to have returned to the capital, Manila, later Tuesday, Alma Jakaria said. Basilan serves as a base for Abu Sayyaf, which wants to establish a separate state for the Philippines' minority Muslim population. The U.S. State Department considers it a terrorist organization and says it is linked to al Qaeda. The Philippine government has been fighting to contain the militants. Abu Sayyaf has been blamed for terrorist attacks in the Philippines, including the 2004 bombing of a ferry that left about 130 people dead as well as past kidnappings. CNN affiliate ABS-CBN's Queenie Casimiro contributed to this report.","The two Americans were abducted with a Filipino relative .

"(CNN) -- Mobile World Congress returned to form this year, with Samsung, Sony, and Huawei all choosing to launch flagship devices in Barcelona. These are my picks from the show: . Nokia X . Just months after being sold to Microsoft, Nokia chose to launch its first Android phones. The devices, all dubbed Nokia X, will run Android but be packed with Microsoft services like OneDrive and Skype. The company says the budget phone will enable Microsoft to enter emerging markets it currently can't reach, but whether they still feel that way when Microsoft takes control in March remains to be seen. Samsung Galaxy S5 . Samsung launched a much more sensible, more cohesive smartphone than previous Galaxy S devices. There's a finger print scanner, a heart rate monitor, new camera tricks, and a clever way of making your downloads faster by combining Wi-Fi and signal coverage together. Samsung also announced a fitness band with a curved OLED screen as it continues its push into wearables. Expect to want the gold one come April. Sony Xperia Z2 . The Sony Xperia Z1 was very well received. However, the Z2 sports the latest Qualcomm processor, bringing with it a stack of improvements. That's the main takeaway here for Sony. Harder, better, faster, stronger, as Daft Punk would say. Early reports and a my own ""hands-on"" test suggest this is going to be one of the best Android phones released this year. Huawei MediaPad X1 . There are two ways to talk up your shiny new powerful tablet. The first is to let it quietly sell on the merits of what you include; the second is to do that and then make sure everyone that comes to your press conference knows how good it is by you trashing the nearest competition - in this case the Nexus 7 and the iPad mini. An amazingly crisp screen, slim form factor, 4G LTE capabilities and a price that is aggressive all help. A Bluetooth battery . Mobile World Congress is not all about state-of-the-art handsets. One gadget that caught my eye is the Tethercell. It appears to be an AA battery, but it's actually a case for a AAA battery. The case is also Bluetooth enabled, so after placing it in your child's noisy toy, you can shut it off with your phone when playtime gets too much to bear. Peace and quiet. How lovely.

"(CNN) -- What applies in real estate, may also be said of free speech -- it is all about location, location, location. Now a First Amendment fight between the U.S. Secret Service and anti-Bush protesters has reached the nation's highest court, testing the discretion of those using their often split-second authority to shield the President. The government told the justices Wednesday in oral arguments that the actions of agents were related to security, while the lawyer representing the demonstrators called it unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination. At issue: legal immunity for the agents, and whether their actions violated ""clearly established"" law in performance of official duties. The court was at times animated, perplexed, and exasperated during a one-hour public session, but appeared ready to reject the free-speech claims, which could end a pending, decade-old lawsuit. Justice Stephen Breyer spoke for many of his colleagues when he said the job of protecting the nation's leader by this ""special protective force"" was especially important and unique. ""Everyone understands the danger. You can't run a risk,"" of allowing the President to be subject to harm, he said. ""At the same time, no one wants a Praetorian Guard that is above the law, and we have examples of history of what happens when you do that. So everyone is looking for some kind of line that permits the protection but denies"" suppression of legitimate protest. The incident happened during a campaign stop in the final hectic weeks before the 2004 election. President George W. Bush made a last-minute decision to dine at the Jacksonville Inn in southern Oregon. Local law enforcement had initially allowed about 250 anti-Bush protesters to stand near an alleyway on the same side of the street as the restaurant and adjacent hotel where the President and his entourage were staying. Pro-Bush supporters were across the street. Bush wanted to eat on the outdoor patio and the Secret Service said the change initially forced agents to order local police and state police to move the anti-Bush crowd across the street. Fifteen minutes later, those demonstrators were moved again, about two blocks further from the inn. They claim it was done solely to put them out of earshot of the dinner guests. The pro-Bush people were allowed to stay, resulting in them being closer to Bush. Seven anti-Bush demonstrators eventually sued, helped by the American Civil Liberties Union. Among them, Michael ""Mookie"" Moss, an organic farmer and local activist. ""In challenging the immunity and lack of constitutional accountability of individuals operating under the cover of government secrecy, this case continues to set precedent while addressing one of the darker corners of our legal system,"" he said in a blog post. ""If those in power are actively or passively given permission to act without accountability, abuse of our most basic rights will continue to occur."" Many of the facts of the case are in dispute, and a trial has not been held pending resolution of the immunity questions. In oral arguments, most of the justices appeared mildly frustrated with the lawyers appearing before them, while trying to explore the limits of when an agent's actions become impermissible. Justice Sonia Sotomayor questioned the government's assertion the anti-Bush crowd was moved to keep anyone out of range of committing violence. ""In fact, the pro-Bush demonstrators were across the street pretty much at a diagonal to the President, and they were permitted to remain there the entire time. They had a throwing distance of a bomb or a shooting distance as well."" Justice Anthony Kennedy repeatedly pressed the Justice Department lawyer to clarify the government's position on whether and when ""subjective intent"" of law enforcement should be considered. ""Would you say that under your view of the case, that there is a First Amendment interest that protesters have, but that it is virtually unenforceable in the context of crowd control?"" asked Kennedy. ""Because it seems to me that if this complaint doesn't survive, nothing will."" Ian Gershengorn tried to articulate a nuanced position, saying some kinds of free speech claims could still be pressed, even if the individual agents prevail in this particular case. He mentioned current lawsuits challenging to Secret Service policy restricting the kinds of signs displayed on a parade route. That clearly irked Justice Antonin Scalia. ""I really don't understand what the government is doing here. It seems to me you want to win this case, but not too big,"" she said, bringing laughter. ""I would think it is in the interest of the United States and the Secret Service to say there are no"" broadly-applied First Amendment claims against the agents. The lawyer for the protesters came under tough questioning as well. Chief Justice John Roberts pointed at lawyer Steven Wilker with a blunt hypothetical. ""You're the head of the Secret Service detail. You've got to evacuate the President right away. Do you go through the anti-Bush crowd or through the pro-Bush crowd? You've got to decide right now quickly. I'm serious. You have to make a split-second decision."" Wilker looked perplexed. ""I think whichever way provides the clearest egress,"" he said, arms outstretched. Roberts: ""No, no. They are both the same. That was one of your propositions, that there is no way to distinguish there. It's too late. You've taken too long to decide."" Roberts continued, ""If we're trying to decide whether viewpoint can ever be a security justification, we have to consider all of the possible situations."" Wilker admitted he was no security expert. ""That's actually not much of an answer for lots of reasons, but the most, if you don't know, how are we supposed to know?"" Sotomayor said. While the agents may win at the high court, the justices seemed torn about adopting a particular general principle to guide future such First Amendment claims. A ruling in the current dispute is expected by the early summer. The case is Wood v. Moss (13-115).","Case involves handling of protesters during George W. Bush's 2004 campaign .

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Senate voted on Thursday to overcome a Republican-led filibuster against tougher gun laws, clearing the way for a major congressional debate on a package of proposals sought by President Barack Obama in the aftermath of the Connecticut school massacre. The procedural vote followed a breakthrough by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, and Pat Toomey, R-Pennsylvania, who reached a compromise on broadening background checks to include private purchases at gun shows and on the Internet. Because of the bipartisan deal, Senate Democrats backing the legislation received support from enough Republicans to approve the cloture motion, 68-31, setting up debate on the proposals and amendments expected to last for two weeks. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, pledged after the key vote to let both sides offer amendments. But he insisted they include an updated ban on semiautomatic firearms modeled after military assault weapons and a limit on ammunition magazines to 10 rounds. Why we're still debating guns . Both proposals were part of Obama's desired legislation, but were dropped from the package brought to the Senate because they would have prevented Democrats from overcoming the GOP filibuster. While just a procedural vote, the Senate action represented a major step for Obama and Democrats in ensuring public votes on the most significant gun legislation to reach the Senate floor in almost two decades. The powerful firearms lobby led by the National Rifle Association opposes the gun-control package and made clear it will seek political retribution on any legislator that supports it. This included Thursday's vote on launching debate. Despite the agreement forged by Manchin and Toomey, both rated as strong supporters of gun rights by the NRA, the prospects for significant gun legislation to win congressional approval remained uncertain. Any measure passed would then go to the Republican-led House, where GOP leaders have indicated resistance to the kind of proposals sought by Obama. On Thursday, House Speaker John Boehner stopped short of promising his chamber would vote on gun legislation, saying he first has to see what gets sent over from the Senate. ""I fully expect that the House will act in some way, shape or form,"" Boehner told reporters. ""But to make a blanket commitment without knowing what the underlying bill is, I think would be irresponsible on my part. The Senate has to produce a bill, and I've made clear, if they produce a bill, we will review it and take it from there."" The NRA clearly rejected the proposed legislation so far, with Chris Cox, who heads the group's institute for legislative action, saying in a letter to the Senate that it ""would unfairly infringe upon the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding gun owners"" and that the group ""unequivocally opposed"" it. The lives shattered by bullets . Cox's letter called the compromise by Manchin and Toomey ""misguided"" and added that Thursday's procedural vote would be included in its assessment of legislators that serves as political ammunition in election campaigns. Two Senate Democrats from pro-gun states up for re-election next year -- Mark Begich of Alaska and Mark Pryor of Arkansas -- voted with 29 Republicans attempting to filibuster the legislation. Sixteen Republicans joined 52 Democrats and Independents in supporting a floor debate. White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters that Obama called relatives of Newtown, Connecticut, shooting victims who were in Washington for the vote to thank them for their efforts to pressure Congress to take up the gun proposals. An earlier statement by more than 30 relatives of the 20 first graders and six educators killed in the massacre last December criticized senators for their attempted filibuster, saying they ""should be ashamed of their attempt to silence efforts to prevent the next American tragedy."" In an emotional scene Wednesday, Manchin choked up while meeting with some of the Newtown residents who praised him for political courage in taking on the NRA. ""You give me more legislative strength than you know,"" Manchin said at one point. He later was unable to speak and reached for a tissue when asked by a reporter how the Newtown families affected his role in the negotiations with Toomey and others. Before the play date, the gun talk . Following the Newtown shootings by a lone gunman, Obama called for a series of proposals including ""universal"" background checks on all gun purchases. Currently, the federal law requiring background checks covers licensed firearms dealers, with private sales excluded. Fierce opposition by the NRA and its allies in Congress -- mostly conservative Republicans but also some Democrats from gun-friendly states -- made clear that the universal checks sought by Obama had no chance of passing, leading to efforts by Manchin, Toomey and others to work out a compromise. In announcing the compromise on Wednesday, Manchin noted the proposal meant that firearms buyers at gun shows would face the same background check currently required in sales by federally licensed gun dealers. In addition, it would close a loophole that exempts intrastate gun sales on the Internet from requiring a background check, he said. Addressing concerns of the NRA that expanding background checks would burden law-abiding gun owners seeking to trade or gift weapons in a personal transfer, Manchin declared that ""personal transfers are not touched whatsoever."" Another provision would recognize the legitimacy of concealed weapons permits across state lines. The Manchin-Toomey compromise also would require states and the federal government to provide records on criminals and the ""violently mentally ill"" to the national background check system, addressing a criticism by the NRA and other opponents of gun laws that the existing system lacks substantive information. Michelle Obama makes emotional entrance into gun debate . In addition, the plan calls for a new National Commission on Mass Violence to report in six months on ""all aspects of the problem, including guns, school safety, mental health, and violent media or video games."" The NRA contends that an expanded background check system would create a paper trail that could eventually be used to build a national gun registry, which they reject as unconstitutional. It also argues that an expanded system would prove a burden to law-abiding gun owners while doing nothing to stop criminals from getting hold of firearms. According to a summary of the compromise proposal, it includes language that prohibits creation of a national gun registry or misusing information from background checks. The NRA said rejection of the universal checks sought by Obama was ""a positive development,"" and it called for ""serious and meaningful solutions"" to gun violence instead of ""blaming law-abiding gun owners for the acts of psychopathic murderers."" Why is this so hard? The disconnect on background checks . Meanwhile, Obama said there were aspects of the Manchin-Toomey compromise that he would like to see strengthened. ""But the agreement does represent welcome and significant bipartisan progress. It recognizes that there are good people on both sides of this issue, and we don't have to agree on everything to know that we've got to do something to stem the tide of gun violence,"" the president said in a statement Wednesday. ""Congress needs to finish the job,"" Obama added, saying he would continue ""asking the American people to stand up and raise their voices because these measures deserve a vote."" Other reaction ranged from cautious support to angry rejection. The Brady Campaign, named after the former White House press secretary wounded in an assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan, called the compromise a ""good step forward,"" while New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo described it as ""better than nothing"" but a sellout to the gun lobby. ""This is a Congress that is captive of the extremists and there is no clearer proof of that than this,"" Cuomo said on the ""Capitol Pressroom"" radio show, adding that the compromise meant ""we are not talking about a significant package of gun control anymore."" Should anyone be able to buy guns? Share your views . Obama has made gun measures a major focus of his second-term agenda, holding events across the country to push for Congress to vote on the package. Opinion: Why the NRA fights background checks . A new national survey showed that 86% of Americans support some expansion of background checks. At the same time, the CNN/ORC International poll released Wednesday also showed a majority of respondents fear that increased background checks would lead to a federal registry of gun owners that could allow the government to take away legally owned weapons. Failing to pass new gun laws would be a stinging defeat for Obama and Democrats. However, a public perception that Republicans blocked popular proposals, such as expanding background checks, could harm GOP prospects in 2014 and 2016 among moderates they need in their corner to have any chance of countering strong support for Democrats by minority demographics such as Hispanic Americans, African Americans and the gay-lesbian vote. The Senate Judiciary Committee passed a package of gun laws proposed by Obama after the Newtown attack by a lone gunman. Proposals in the committee's package included expanding background checks on gun buyers, toughening laws against gun trafficking and straw purchases, banning semiautomatic rifles modeled after military assault weapons as well as large-capacity ammunition magazines, and coming up with ideas for improving school safety. Reid dropped the weapons ban, which would update a similar 1994 law that expired a decade later, saying it lacked enough support to overcome a filibuster. Background checks on gun sales: How do they work? Some states already have passed stricter gun laws similar to the federal proposals since the Newtown shootings. They include Connecticut, where the killings occurred, and Colorado, the site of two other notorious mass shootings that contributed to a renewed gun debate in America. The current background check system was created in 1989. It requires federally approved gun dealers to check whether gun buyers have a criminal background or other problem to make them ineligible to purchase a firearm. Under the system, the gun dealer maintains a record of the transaction, but the federal government keeps no such identifying paperwork. According to a Justice Department report, less than 2% of those seeking to purchase firearms were denied because of background checks from 1998 through 2009. Opponents cite that figure as evidence that the system fails to stop illegal weapons sales that the legislation seeks to target, while supporters say the result shows the system keeps some guns out of the hands of the wrong people and the system should be expanded and strengthened.

"(CNN) -- Bulgarian and Greek police have arrested at least 11 people for allegedly trafficking babies, authorities in both countries said Tuesday. Six people were arrested in Greece, including a doctor and lawyer, while five people were detained in Bulgaria, according to a statement from the Bulgarian interior ministry. The investigation, dubbed ""Operation Babies,"" discovered 14 cases of women who had agreed to sell their newborns, it said. A spokesman for the Greek police said 12 people were arrested -- seven in Greece and five in Bulgaria. Pregnant women from poor families in Bulgaria were brought to Greece, where they were given a place to stay before and for a few days after the birth of their children, the Bulgarian statement said. Clients paid up to 20,000 euros for a boy and around 15,000 euros for a girl, it said. The mothers were reportedly given no more than 1,500 euros per child. The police spokesman in Greece said the price of the baby also depended on the color of its skin. Most clients were childless couples, he said. Police were tipped off by a woman who gave birth to a baby girl in Greece, the Bulgarian ministry said. She reportedly refused to leave the child, which was then taken from her by force, said the statement. The baby is expected to be reunited with her mother. Journalist Elinda Labropoulou contributed to this report.","Authorities in Bulgaria, Greece arrest around a dozen people .
