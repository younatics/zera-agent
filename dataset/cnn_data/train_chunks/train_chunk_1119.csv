"Another day of reckoning. Another examination with a positive outcome. This, though, was possibly Joe Schmidt’s most valuable result yet. He clinched the title last year away to the French, but that was with a settled side going full tilt at the end of a campaign. Here, going in with rust in the names of Johnny Sexton and Sean O’Brien, he’d gambled on quality ahead of game time and the ambitious punt ultimately paid dividend, Ireland taking a deserved victory despite late French desperation. Johnny Sexton gets treatment on the pitch following his collision with Mathieu Bastareaud . Ireland fly-half Sexton was in the wars again after 12-week concussion lay-off . The visitors ate into an 18-6 deficit with Romain Taofifenua’s 71st minute try just seconds before Rory Best’s sin-binning expired, and they then launched a cavalry charge. However, faced with determined Irish resistance, they didn’t have the nous to unlock teak home defending and a seven-point margin was just about right. You could accuse Ireland of winning ugly as France won the try count 1-0, but that would be a disservice to their effort in a troublesome quarrel where it took time for Sexton and O’Brien to get up to speed after their respective long lay-offs. That both played a significant leadership role in helping Ireland see out their end-game reflected well on Schmidt’s pluck to select them, and he was be even more pleased that his out-half walked off with only a bit of blood spilt following some head-punishing collisions with Mathieu Bastareaud. Blood seeps from a cut on the head of Ireland's lock Paul O'Connell (right) Ireland's flanker Peter O'Mahony (left) is tackled by France's flanker Bernard le Roux . Brave in the tackle, Sexton varied his kicking game smartly, shepherding his pack around in a contest they initially appeared they could win in a flourish. However a 12-6 interval lead was only increased by a further six points, Jared Payne spilling the ball forward just when it appeared Sexton had given him the try-scoring assist. Despite the shortage of tries and the crazily high penalty count of 25, this was a clash that had much more going for it than the lack of entertainment both sides were guilty of in round one. Its pattern somewhat mirrored the November Irish win over Australia given how tight it was coming down the home straight. In the end, it concluded with France running out of ideas and width, Simon Zebo clasping hold of Remi Lamerat out wide near the 22 and O’Brien arriving in forager’s fashion to help bundle the French ball carrier into touch. Cue sigh of Irish relief all round, followed by well-earned smiles. France's flanker Thierry Dusautoir (left) passes the ball back to France's Uini Atonio . France's Camille Lopez runs at Paul O'Connell of Ireland at Aviva Stadium . With conditions perfect, Ireland demonstrated more initiative on their kick-off receipt than they did throughout most of last weekend’s low quality spectacle in Rome, putting the ball through the hands from one side of the 22 to the other before punting clear. Thirteen minutes had passed by the time they hit the front, Sexton scoring a penalty from the left of the 22 despite an initial tactical kicking duel giving way to some scrum worries. Retribution by Mike Ross on a French feed left Sexton kicking to inside the 22 and it brought a shot at the posts off the ensuing maul. Trouble was, Ireland quickly conceded at the ruck, Camille Lopez tying it up, but they were given an easy invite to retake the lead. Sexton’s restarting kick hung lovely for Tommy Bowe to flap back and the fast-maturing Robbie Henshaw to gather. Guilhem Guirado was penalised for loitering on the wrong side of the ruck. France's Pascal Pape is shown a yellow card for a knee in the back of Jamie Heaslip during a ruck . If 6-3 at the end of the first quarter was encouraging, what followed for the next 10 minutes was exasperating. Twice Ireland conceded penalties at the ruck for not releasing inside the French 22. Then on another raid, ball carried by Henshaw was softly stolen at the breakdown by Bastareaud, resulting in France having a lineout in the Irish 22 once Jack McGrath erred at a halfway ruck. The hosts craftily opted not to engage at the French maul and the visitors were penalised for crossing just as they thought they were going in for a try. Relieved, Ireland upped the tempo at the ruck and a ruck penalty saw Sexton land his third kick, this time from the 10-metre line with seven minutes to go to the break. Sexton celebrates after the final whistle at Aviva Stadium on Saturday . French players can't hide their disappointment after Saturday's defeat in Dublin . Lopez quickly nailed a penalty in reply, but Schmidt’s side finished the half six points clear, Bowe again excellent under Sexton’s restart as he tackled Damien Chouly to touch. Henshaw, Paul O’Connell and Jamie Heaslip all had charges off the following lineout possession, with Henshaw’s second gallop forcing – yes, you guessed it – another ruck penalty. Ireland pressed hard after the interval, temporary replacement Ian Madigan landing a 51st minute penalty. Then came Pascal Papé’s yellow for kneeing Heaslip, but Ireland failed to score in the eight minutes they held a man advantage before Best saw yellow. The champions managed well for a time, Sexton scoring on 68 minutes after Chouly strayed offside, but Taofifenua’s unconverted try set up a grandstand finish after a terrible Lopez penalty miss while Best was off. Nails were bitten, but Ireland had the bluster to hold on. Now for England.","Johnny Sexton fired 15 points in Ireland's ninth consecutive victory .

"Rickie Lambert is on the verge of completing a sensational move to Liverpool and his journey represents a victory for hope and hard work. The 32-year-old has played in every . division but famously had to go part-time when he was released by Blackpool . earlier in his career and work screwing the tops on beetroot jars in a factory. Now he is in the England World Cup squad and set to rejoin his boyhood club, who released him when he was a teenager. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Rickie Lambert's reaction to scoring on his England debut . Academy awards: Rickie Lambert with trophies when he was at Liverpool as an 11-year-old (left) and as a nine-year-old at Millbrook Primary School in Kirkby, again with plenty of trophies . All smiles: Lambert with his wife Amy, one of the biggest influences on his career . Proud: Lambert's parents Ray and Maureen, who helped their son through his difficult early career . Great story: Match of the Day host Gary Linkeker tweeted his delight at Rickie's rise . That rejection hit Lambert hard, as he admitted earlier in the season: ‘I was at Liverpool from age 10 to 15 and . I was basically told I wasn’t good enough, which obviously was a hard . thing to take at the time. ‘I thought it was the end of the world. But I can tell people in the . same situation that it is not the end of the world. It should drive you . on to succeed even more.' His . career prospects seemed even more bleak when, after just two matches in . three years, Lambert was released by Blackpool in 2000. From . there, it was the beetroot factory and part-time football with . Macclesfield. It was a dark time for Lambert, something he has not shied . away from discussing. ‘After leaving Blackpool there was a period without a club,' he said. 'I didn’t . have a contract, so I wasn’t getting paid for four or five months. It . was a very difficult time. I was debating what I could do outside the . game. But I didn’t want to do anything outside of football. Fresh faced: Lambert (left) during his time with Macclesfield, where he played part-time for a spell . County set: Lambert (right) moved to Stockport and established himself as a lower-league player . Partnership: Grant Holt was Lambert's strike partner at Rochdale and also went played in the Premier League . ‘So I was trying my best to get to training at Macclesfield because it wasn’t close. ‘I had to get a job and that one in the beetroot factory was one of the . only jobs I could get at the time. I was putting lids on jars, getting . paid £20 a day. I would work in the day and go training in the evening.' After a more successful spell at Stockport, he really began his rise from bloke who worked with jars to being a star when . Rochdale boss Steve Parkin moved him from midfield. Lambert was 23 at the time and forged a . formidable partnership with Grant Holt and they scored 27 goals in 24 . matches . Good move: Lambert was a midfielder before Steve Parkin converted him to a striker at Rochdale . Net gains: Lambert while he was at Bristol Rovers, where his career carried on its upward trajectory . Three of Lambert's former clubs are now non-League - Stockport, Macclesfield and Bristol Rovers, who dropped down to the Conference earlier this month. Bristol Rovers - Conference (last season 23rd in League Two, relegated) Stockport - Conference North (2013-14 14th) Macclesfield - Conference (2013-14 15th) It got the striker noticed by Bristol Rovers and he moved there for £200,000. Southampton . signed him for £1million . in 2009 but only became their main man after . words of advice from former manager Alan Pardew, who told him to get in . shape. ‘That really stuck,’ Lambert said. ‘I was overweight, basically. I wasn’t looking after my body the way I should have.’ He knuckled down and his goals have . fired the Saints up two divisions and his Premier League exploits led to an England debut. And what a debut. Lambert headed . the winner against Scotland at Wembley with his first touch after barely . three minutes on the pitch. Hitman: Lambert continued his fine form at Bristol Rovers, scoring one in every two games . Chasing his dream: Lambert (right) playing for Bristol Rovers against Shrewsbury . Kicking on: Lambert really progressed at Rovers (right) but took it to a new level at Southampton . After scoring he said: 'I dreamed of this all my life, it means . so much. It was a great corner by Leighton . Baines, where I wanted it and it was great to get on the end of it. 'I've tried to play it calm all week, when all I wanted to do was scream! 'I don't mind people talking about the beetroot factory - it shows how far I've come. 'It was great to have my family here. I'm so happy for those who made it possible - my parents, my wife, . three kids and Southampton. They've been different class.' And . he did not stop there.

"Sports stores are not stocking England's £90 World Cup shirt because staff believe football fans will not buy them. Since its controversial release last month, critics have said Nike strip which will be worn by the team in Brazil this summer is 'too expensive'. As a result, chains including JD Sports and Sports Direct have not put them on their shelves because 'people aren't touching them'. Rip off: England's £90 World Cup shirt has been branded as 'ludicrously expensive' and sports stores say fans simply will not buy them . The Prime Minister has called for the Football Association and merchandisers Nike to 'rethink' the hefty price tag of the shirts. The £90 shirt is identical to those that will be worn by Roy Hodgson's side. An adult 'stadium' England shirt, which is made from a different material, is priced . at £60, while shirts for children aged between eight and 15 cost £42. A parent wanting to get the full Nike kit – shirt, shorts and socks – for a 12-year-old would have to pay between £71 and £119. While JD sports sells the stadium shirt online for £55, staff at an outlet in Turrock, Essex, have said the full-priced kit will 'not sell'. Labour MP Paul Farrelly, a member of Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee, told The Sunday Mirror: 'It's a ludicrously expensive price and people are perfectly free as to whether they pay it or not.' Nike have backed the choice of the price, saying it represents the research that went into putting the kit together. The manufacturers claim eight water recycled water bottles go into every shirt and the income from the strip will help promote grass roots football. JD sports will be stocking the replica shirt closer to the tournament but will be selling it in 'limited numbers.' Despite the price tag, the shirt's label reveals the kit is manufactured in Indonesia, where the cost of manufacturing a shirt is alleged to be around £4. Design: The shirt, which is also available in red, has sparked widespread criticism, but Nike have justified the price tag, because of the amount spent on researching the kit . After their release, Sports minister Helen Grant took to . Twitter to say: 'On £90 England football shirts for fans, it's not . right. Loyal supporters are the bedrock of our national game - pricing . needs a rethink.' The . kit – in both a white and a red away version – has been launched just . ten months after the shirts were last changed in May 2013. This appears . to be at odds with a long-standing convention to protect the pockets of . fans by changing the national team kit only every two years. In the mid-2000s replica England shirts were on sale for £30 almost as soon as they were released . The . prices have since risen steeply, but they are dependent on results on . the field. Following England’s 4-1 defeat to Germany in the 2010 World . Cup the price for the replica shirts worn in that tournament plummeted. The row comes 11 years after the FA, . sports retailers and clubs were fined more than £16million for . colluding to inflate the price of shirts. Nike took over the lucrative England kit supply deal from Umbro last year and is paying £25million a while the FA said it has no control over the cost of shirts. Criticism: Labour MP Paul Farrelly (left) said the shirts are 'ludicrously expensive', following on from claims by David Cameron that the price tag was too 'hefty'","JD Sports and Sports Direct stores do not have the new shirt .

"The Eiffel Tower was evacuated tonight following a telephoned terrorist bomb warning. Some 1,500 people, including tourists and staff, were escorted out of France's most famous landmark shortly after 7.30pm. It follows threats from Al-Qaeda pledging 'revenge' for the French intervention in the African state of Mali to fight Islamic terrorists. Tonight, police were standing guard near the Eiffel Tower in Paris after an anonymous phone call announced an attack on the monument . Police said an anonymous call had been received from a phone booth in a Paris suburb warning that explosives had been place around the tower. The bomb warning said the blast would happen at 9.30pm, said police. But by 10pm there had been no explosion. The tower was still shut, with trained sniffer dog teams searching for a possible bomb. ‘It may be that the tower does not reopen tonight,’ said a police spokesman. ‘Searches are carrying on, but no members of the public are being allowed anywhere near. There has been a full evacuation.’ The tower is normally open until midnight during the Easter weekend, and nearby restaurants including Le Jules Verne are particularly busy on a Saturday night. A police cordon was formed around the tower and people were moved to the banks of the nearby River Seine. There have been numerous bomb alerts at the Eiffel Tower in recent years, and France is currently on the highest state vigilance alert because of threats from  Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. Sniffer dog teams searched the landmark for explosives after the Eiffel Tower was evacuated shortly after 7.30pm . President Francois Hollande has placed himself at the centre of the global war against terrorism, committing troops and airpower to the on-going war in Mali. He has also stepped up security in mainland France, where there is a constant fear that Islamic extremists will strike. The 1,050ft tall iron lattice tower was built for the 1889 World’s Fair, and soon turned into a prestige symbol of modern France. It is the most visited paid-for monument in the world, with some 7million people a year going up it. For all these reasons, French security officials frequently highlight the tower’s vulnerability to terrorist attack.","Police received telephoned warning from a phone booth in a Paris suburb .

"Liverpool are heading for Miami to do battle with arch rivals Manchester United on Monday after a comfortable 2-0 win over a dismal AC Milan side in Charlotte. Goals from Joe Allen and Suso made it three wins out of three for Brendan Rodgers' men in the International Champions Cup. Liverpool were already assured of top spot in their group following Manchester City's 5-4 defeat to Olympiacos on penalties earlier in the day after it had finished 2-2. VIDEO Scroll down to watch some of Liverpool's highlights from their pre-season US tour . Great start: Joe Allen is congratulated by Rickie Lambert after his opener for Liverpool against AC Milan . Young star: Raheem Sterling looks to take the ball of Milan midfielder Michael Essien . Spurned: Rickie Lambert missed a penalty for Liverpool, a great chance for an early goal in his Reds career . LIVERPOOL: Mignolet, Kelly (Johnson 60), Toure (Sakho 60), Coates (Skrtel 60), Robinson Enrique 60), Lucas (Gerrard 60), Henderson (Suso 46), Allen (Can 60), Lambert (Peterson 60), Ibe (Coutinho 60), Sterling (Coady 46). Goals: Allen (17), Suso (89). AC MILAN: Abbiati (Gabriel 46), Abate (Zapate 80), Bonera, Rami (Mexes 66), De Sciglio, Essien (Cristante 66), Muntari (Poli 80), Saponara, Niang, Pazzini (Balotelli 46), El Shaarway (Honda 66). Referee: David Gantar . However, they made no mistake in front of a 70,000-strong crowd at the Bank of America Stadium as they easily dealt with the challenge of Milan, who had already been heavily beaten by Olympiacos and Man City. Rodgers used no fewer than 21 players to ensure his squad is ready for the first showdown with United since Louis van Gaal's appointment as David Moyes' successor. With Daniel Sturridge ruled out with a minor knock sustained in training and £20million new boy Lazar Markovic sidelined by a tendon problem, Liverpool made five changes following the win over Manchester City in New York. Brad Jones, Jose Enrique, Steven Gerrard, Philippe Coutinho and Sturridge were replaced by Simon Mignolet, Jack Robinson, Lucas Leiva, Jordon Ibe and Raheem Sterling. Lightning-quick teenage wingers Ibe and Sterling lit up the opening 45 minutes as their pace tormented Milan's overworked backline. Liverpool were in control from the start and took the lead in the 17th minute. Big crowd: Kolo Toure lead the team out in Charlotte on Saturday . Relaxed: Already in the final, Brendan Rodgers was able to give Steven Gerrard a rest . Allen's work rate created the chance as he dispossessed former Chelsea midfielder Michael Essien and burst clear. The Wales international fired against the woodwork and Sterling's effort from the follow up was blocked by Christian Abbiati. The ball fell back into the path of Allen, who volleyed home in style. Sterling was then denied by Abbiati before Kolo Toure made a crucial tackle to thwart Giampaolo Saponara at the other end. Ibe, who enjoyed a beneficial loan spell at Birmingham City last season, showcased his exciting potential. The youngster was on the receiving end of some rough treatment from former Portsmouth man Sulley Muntari but he picked himself up and battled on. Keeping tabs: The Liverpool manager and his backroom staff observe the game . Ibe began the attack which should have yielded a second goal in the 27th minute. He raced 50 yards before linking up with Lambert and Sterling, who was pulled to the ground by Adil Rami. Lambert, who never missed in his 34 penalties for Southampton, took responsibility but his spot-kick was kept out by Abbiati. Milan did threaten just before the break but Mignolet grabbed Mbaya Niang's strike at the second attempt and Allen dealt with the danger after Stephan El Shaarawy raced into the penalty area. Suso and Conor Coady came on for Henderson and Sterling as Rodgers began to rest players with one eye on Monday's final in Miami. There were eight more changes on the hour mark with the introduction of Steven Gerrard receiving a rapturous ovation from the 70,000-strong crowd. The raft of subs dented the flow of the game and chances were at a premium. Making an impression: Jordan Ibe (left) battles with Mattia De Sciglio for possession . Ibe continued to shine with another classy burst down the left as he got the better of Rami but Milan survived. Gerrard sparked panic with a through ball to Suso which triggered a thundering collision between Gabriel and Mattia De Sciglio. The Liverpool skipper went close from long range before Milan threatened to restore parity. Mbaye Niang went clean through but Mignolet raced out and made a brave sprawling save. Muntari's strike was then deflected wide before Liverpool killed off the Italians in the 89th minute. Coutinho raced into space down the left and teed up Suso, who swept a low left-footer into the far corner. Mignolet's stunning finger tip save denied Bryan Cristante deep into stoppage time as Liverpool march on to Miami on a high.","Allen nets first-half opener against Serie A side .

He said initially they thought it may have been a bull shark or possibly a short fin mako. 'I couldn't believe it. We were actually quite close to shore I touched its tail and it was made out of pure muscle. I always thought that you could move it around or at least squeeze it. It was as solid as a brick.'

"The internet is alight today with stories of faith, confections, and one very famous egg roll, but the biggest web destination of them all has opted to honor a leftist labor activist instead of the Easter holiday. Several times per year, and sometimes per month, internet search behemoth Google shakes things up on its incredibly high-traffic homepage by changing its logo to celebrate a memorable day in history like a famous person’s birthday or world-changing event. This past February 6, for instance, the company honored what would have been famed anthropologist Mary Leakey’s 100th birthday. Earlier in the year, Google gave nods to the birthdays of baseball legend Jackie Robinson, Dr. Martin Luther King, and, true to the company’s quirky form, pioneering ice resurfacer Frank Zamboni. Daring doodle: Some Christians are angry Google honored labor activist Cesar Chavez in Easter Sunday's Google Doodle instead of their holiday . The ‘Google Doodles’ began as a way for Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin to leave a sort of ‘Out of the Office’ message when they placed a stick figure within their logo before taking off for Nevada’s Burning Man festival in 1998. Since then, the Doodle has grown in frequency and popularity and become a fun way to learn about history, world-changing events like the fall of the Berlin Wall, and about famous scientific innovations like the Hubble Telescope. As with Dr. Martin Luther King’s Doodle, Google has remained dedicated over the years to celebrating important social figures in their Doodles. Today, that tradition continued. Biased? Some believe Google is disrespecting Christians by not recognizing the Easter holiday while honoring a celebrated labor leader . Important figures: Google tends to honor ground-breaking figures and scientific milestones on its altered homepage . In celebration of labor activist and United Farm Workers co-founder Cesar Chavez, Google changed one of the O’s in its logo to a portrait of the legendary organizer. The decision to honor Chavez on this particular day has some perplexed and others angry. It may be Chavez’s birthday, but it also happens to be Easter Sunday. Fox News Radio personality Todd Starnes took to his webpage to air his grievances. ‘Christians across the nation are outraged after Google decided to honor labor leader Cesar Chavez’s birthday instead of Jesus Christ on Easter Sunday,’ Starnes wrote. Alongside his complaints, Starnes posted an excerpt of the declaration from President Obama designation of March 31 as Cesar Chavez Day. Starnes also posted comments sent in by his readers, many of them urging a Christian boycott of Google. ‘Goodbye Google, hello Bing,’ wrote one Starnes reader, referencing Microsoft’s competing search engine. Inclusive: Google has never mentioned Christmas in its Doodles, preferring more general 'Happy Holidays' well-wishing . Like Starnes’ page, former television personality Glen Beck’s outlet The Blaze also suggests that Christians are furious with Google. As evidence, both The Blaze and Todd Starnes link to a list of angry tweets on the issue compiled at website Twitchy. In 2013, the Christian celebration of the resurrection of Jesus Christ happens to coincide with what Obama declared Cesar Chavez Day back in 2011. Instead of honoring the over 2000-year-old Christian holiday, the Silicon Valley titan threw its weight behind a leftist activist. Some may view this as evidence that Golden State liberalism allows political values to trump religious ones. However, taking a look back at Google Doodles from the past 15 or so years reveals some patterns that might get Google’s head off the naughty lists of the faithful. For starters, Easter changes dates . every year and Cesar Chavez Day does not. The two coincided this year . and will do so again in future years. The next will be 2024, followed by 2086, and again in 2097 and in 2176. For . the folks upset with Google today who are still around in 2024 and hoping for . an Easter Doodle, be aware of another fact: . Google hasn’t had an Easter . Doodle since 2000. They never had one before and they have not had one . since. In fact, the . company that many would argue is largely apolitical seems also to be . largely areligious. At least if its Doodles are any indication. Secular . celebrations Earth Day, Halloween, and Thanksgiving are Doodle . mainstays, but come Christmas time the holiday shoutouts on the Google . homepage became decidedly more generic. Back . in 1998, Google only had three Doodles and none of them celebrated . Christmas. There was a Thanksgiving Doodle, a introduction of Google . Beta, and the Burning Man Doodle. Light-hearted: Heros and beloved personalities alike can become Doodles, as Julia Child did for what would have been her 100th birthday in 2012 . In 1999, the company began posting ‘Happy Holidays’ Doodles around Christmas but has never specifically referenced the Christian celebration. They tend, instead, to celebrate winter and the spirit of the holidays in general. And, oddly enough, 2006’s holiday Doodles also celebrated Kangaroos. The point seems to be that Google is not interested in celebrating the holidays of any specific religion, at all. Just as there are no Christian holidays, there are no Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Zoroastrian, Baha’I, or any other religious celebrations honored with Google Doodles. Whether this is because there are so many, because the company wants to avoid placing one faith over another, or because they simply prefer not to just because is unclear. Once: Google posted an Easter Doodle only once, in 2000. Not before or since has their Doodle recognized any religious holiday . To the credit of those angry at Google’s decision today, Google has never before posted any Doodle whatsoever on Easter Sunday. Then again, Cesar Chavez Day has never, in its three-year history, fallen on Easter. To put things in perspective, Google has posted Doodles with no religious significance during sacred holidays before. During Passover in 2012, Google honored the 100th birthday of a French photographer named Robert Doisneau but not the Jewish holiday. The Muslim holiday of Ramadan coincided with the Olympic Games in 2012 and Google honored 17 sports events with Doodles, as well as the birthdays of chef Julia Child, pilot Amelia Earhart, and artist Gustav Klimt, but made no mention of the holy month of fasting. And instead of the high Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur in 2009, Google chose to celebrate its own 11th birthday.","Conservative groups are calling for a boycott of the ubiquitous search giant in favor of others, like Microsoft's Bing .

Back home: Daniel Sturridge has returned home from Liverpool's tour of the United States with a hamstring injury, but his manager Brendan Rodgers insists he will be fit for the start of the Premier League season . Assurance: Rodgers confirmed that Sturridge will miss the International Champions Cup final with Manchester United in Miami on Monday but said he should return in next weekend's friendly with Borussia Dortmund . Into the final: Liverpool defeated AC Milan 2-0 to book their place in the final of the International Champions Cup, with Joe Allen (pictured with Rickie Lambert) and Suso on target . 'Dan has flown back,' Rodgers confirmed. 'He wasn't going to be ready for the game on Monday but there is no concern there. 'He will be ready for the game against Borussia Dortmund next weekend. 'It was just best to get him back to the training ground so he can get some treatment there. He has a really, really slight feeling in his hamstring. Nothing major.' Goals from Joe Allen and Suso saw off the challenge of Milan in front of nearly 70,000 fans in North Carolina. Liverpool were already assured of top spot in Group B after Manchester City's defeat to Olympiacos on penalties. 'We were excellent and continues a lot of the good work that has taken place over the pre-season,' he said. Test of strength: Sturridge competes for the ball with Matija Nastasic during Liverpool's victory over Manchester City in their second International Champions Cup fixture last week . Making sure: Suso (centre) scored Liverpool's second goal against Milan to guarantee their progress . 'I was delighted with the performance. A lot of the players got longer game time with a lot of young players out there. 'AC Milan have some very good players but defensively we were very strong and pressed the ball well. 'We were very hungry to get the football and some of our play was outstanding. 'What pleased me tonight was the real maturity to our game, understanding the system and understanding the style, and having that belief that we can win games. Even in pre-season creating that mentality is very important. 'We were here in this tournament to do well and we've got to the final. Now we hope to win it as well as getting our preparation right for the start of the season.' True colours: Liverpool fans in Charlotte get behind their team ahead of the Milan game . Next up: Louis van Gaal will get an early taste of the Liverpool vs Manchester United rivalry when the two teams meet in Monday's final . Rodgers is relishing the prospect of locking horns with Louis van Gaal's United, who won Group A after beating Real Madrid 3-1 in Michigan. 'These are top players and for top players every game is a competition,' Rodgers said. 'When you work for a club like Liverpool there are never too many friendlies. 'The game on Monday will be equally competitive. It's been a really good pre-season for us and we hope to finish it well. 'Liverpool vs Manchester United is arguably the biggest game in the world and for it to be here in the United States is great viewing for the supporters and the tournament organisers. 'They are the two biggest clubs in Britain and two of the biggest in the world. It will be a fantastic game and we are looking forward to it. 'It's more than football, it's about two cities, which aren't very far apart but have always been huge rivals.'","England striker Sturridge has returned home early from club's tour of the United States after sustaining hamstring injury .

"A hearing impaired 9-year-old girl has touched hearts across the nation after she wrote an adorable letter to deaf Seahawks running back Derrick Coleman, calling him her inspiration and telling him 'I know how you feel.' Little Riley Kovalcik, from Roxbury, New Jersey, penned the note to Coleman after she and her identical twin sister, Erin, who is also hearing impaired, watched a moving Duracell ad about his journey to become the first legally deaf offensive player in the NFL. The sisters were glued to the TV Sunday, cheering as Coleman helped Seattle beat the San Francisco 49ers to make it through to this year's Super Bowl - and his success compelled Riley to reach out to the sportsman.

The sweet fan went on to list what she and Coleman have in common. 'I where (sic) two hearing aids. I love sports.

'...so when the Seahawks were playing, the girls were right there watching and they were like, 'Where is he? Where is he?' he said. When they won, his daughters were beyond excited. 'Riley said she wanted to write a note to Derrick and could I send it to him, so I said ""of course."" 'When I read it I was like ""oh my god, really?""' Kovalcik said he searched for Coleman on Twitter Sunday but the sportsman didn't have an account. A day later, after the Duracell spot had captivated audiences around the country and perhaps the world, the football player had set one up. 'So I took a picture of the note and tweeted at him,' Kovalcik said. Not held back: The proud father said apart from a couple of special classes, the girls, pictured, are treated the same as the other kids at their school . Outgoing: 'We have never treated them differently, it's just been ""everyone has their challenges, this is how you're different and you do the best you can,""' Kovalcik said of his daughters, pictured here with their little brother, Aiden. 'They are wonderful, incredibly outgoing little girls' Heart-felt: 'Riley said she wanted to write a note to Derrick and could I send it to him, so I said ""of course."" 'When I read it I was like ""oh my god, really?""' the dad said . Before he knew it, the Seahawks had retweeted Riley's letter and his phone was beeping uncontrollably as more and more fans shared the touching message. 'Riley and Erin just sat there with my phone, watching, and they were like ""oh my god dad, you went viral,""' he recalled, laughing. But all Kovalcik really wanted was for Coleman to know the impact he'd had. 'I just wanted to show him what he had done,' he told MailOnline. 'He inspired my daughters but it's a great thing he's doing not just for hearing impaired kids or kids with other disabilities, he's showing all kids that if you work hard and you dedicate yourself whatever deficiencies you have, you can be great. I wanted to thank him.' The proud father said apart from a couple of special classes, the girls are treated the same as the other kids at their school. Blown away: Kovalcik and his wife Tracy were blown away by Coleman's success, he said. Coleman is pictured here as a child . We have never treated them differently, it's just been ""everyone has their challenges, this is how you're different and you do the best you can,""' Kovalcik said. 'They are wonderful, incredibly outgoing little girls.' He and his wife Tracy, who also have a five-year-old son, Aiden, said they were blown away by the success of the sportsman who has been deaf since the age of three. 'It's really amazing the fact he overcame so much as a little kid growing up when hearing aids, well they're still expensive today, but 10-15 years ago they were really expensive. He overcame it all.' Coleman hasn't responded to the tweet yet, but Kovalcik said that doesn't matter - he still has two new lifelong fans. 'We were Dolphins and Giants fans but I can guarantee my girls will be fans of his forever and I probably will be purchasing a lot of Seahawks gear in future.'

"Selfie fans know that even the best filter action can’t take the place of good lighting. But flipping the camera around on a smartphone means you’re often left in the dark, or squinting against a front-facing flash. Now a new smartphone case, which can illuminate the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5S, means that a flawless selfie can be taken anywhere. Scroll down for video . Dubbed the LuMee, the iPhone case was the brainchild of 57-year-old Allan Shoemake from New Jersey . Dubbed the LuMee, the device was the brainchild of 57-year-old Allan Shoemake from The Boonton Township, New Jersey. He came up with the idea while he was Skype to video chat with his daughter, who was studying abroad in Italy. ‘I said, “I can hardly see you. Why don’t you go by the window?”’ Mr Shoemake told Alexa Valiente at ABC News. ‘I said to my wife, “Why don’t they have a light out there to help light up cellphones or computers?”’ With that in mind, Mr Shoemake plugged in Christmas lights around a foam board and attached it to his computer. Mr Shoemakec ame up with the idea while he was Skype to video chat with his daughter, who was abroad. the photographer has now created the LuMee case which currently sells for $40 (£24) on Amazon . To adjust the brightness, users can use the dimmer at the back of the case. The lighting lasts around two and a half hours on its highest setting of brightness and 36 hours on the lowest setting . Taking the idea a step further, the photographer has now created the LuMee case which currently sells for $40 (£24) on Amazon. The case has built-in LED lights at the front, is powered by its own battery and takes around 30 to 45 minutes to charge. To adjust the brightness, users can user the dimmer at the back of the case. The lighting lasts around two and a half hours on its highest setting of brightness and 36 hours on the lowest setting. The cases are made in China and Mr Shoemake says he is now producing around 18,000 cases each week. Samsung Galaxy S6 will be able to buy a LuMee case this October, and a similar case for iPad and other tablets is currently in development. Celebrities take them to show off their lavish lifestyles and normal people use them to document their movements on social media sites. But experts have linked selfies with mental illness and have suggested that people regularly searching for the perfect angle from which to portray themselves could in some cases be ill. One leading psychiatrist said the majority of patients he sees with Body Dysmorphic Disorder take a lot of selfies. Dr David Veale, a consultant psychiatrist in cognitive behaviour therapy at the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust told MailOnline: ‘Taking Selfies is not an addiction - it’s a symptom of Body Dysmorphic Disorder that involves checking one’s appearance.’ Selfie fans with BDD can spend hours trying to take pictures that do not show any defects or flaws in their appearance, which they are very aware of but which might be unnoticeable to others. Often, people who take selfies take several photographs until they find their best angle or pose, but picking out small details can make people very self-conscious about the tiniest of ‘flaws’. In one extreme case, a British teenager Danny Bowman tried to commit suicide because he was unsatisfied with his appearance in the selfies he took.","The LuMee was invented by 57-year-old photographer Allan Shoemake .

"College enrolment in 2012 dropped by a half million students compared to the year before. Figures released by the U.S. Census Bureau also show the number students who are over the age of 25 also fell. There are 419,000 fewer students that have enrolled at universities across the country. College dropoff: The number of U.S. university students declined by almost half a million last year, following years of growth . Conversely, there has been an increase in college enrollments with  3.2 million new students entering classrooms between 2006 and 2011. Enrollment by Hispanics in U.S. colleges rose 15 percent from 2011 to 2012 even as the overall college population declined. Nearly 3.4 million Hispanics enrolled in college undergraduate or graduate programs in 2012, as the adult Hispanic population grew and because of greater demand from within the ethnic group, the bureau said. Hispanic students have grown as a percentage of the overall college student population from 11 percent in 2006 to 17 percent in 2012. On the rise: Enrollment by Hispanics in U.S. colleges rose 15 percent from 2011 to 2012 even as the overall college population declined . 'This increase in the number of Hispanics enrolled in college can be attributed to the combination of an increase in the adult Hispanic population and their climbing likelihood of being enrolled,' Julie Siebens, a statistician for the Census Bureau, said in a statement. The Census Bureau report, titled School Enrolment: 2012, is the latest in a series of studies that seem to show that older people who fled to colleges and universities during tough economic times might be heading back into the workforce. President Barack Obama took a two-day tour in late August to campaign for college affordability, stopping at locations in New York and Pennsylvania. Among other initiatives, Obama pushed for a college rating system that would help students and their parents determine which colleges would provide the best return for their tuition dollars. ‘We've got a crisis in terms of college affordability and student debt,’ Obama said during a stop at the State University of New York at Buffalo. ‘We can't price the middle class, and everybody working to get into the middle class, out of an education.’","Half a million fewer students enrolled in colleges in 2012 than 2011 .

"West Ham United fans threw their fury at Sam Allardyce as West Bromwich Albion dealt them out a thrashing in the FA Cup.

"A New York-based designer and art director has embarked on a project which aims to catalog the intricate mosaic Subway signs of New York's vast underground network – and reveal their untold stories. Adam Chang, a Brooklyn native, has been quietly looking past the grimy, crowded tunnels that snake beneath the city to find beauty in the unique ceramic art works that have stood for over a century, often unappreciated. So far, he has covered 118 stations, which he photographs and then digitally illustrates, and has spent 20 hours riding trains to document the signs for his NY Train Project. Art: Designer Adam Chung has launched the NY Train Project, which catalogs his illustrations of the beautiful mosaic signs of MTA's New York subway system, including this sign for Bleecker Street . 'One day while waiting for the 6 train at the Bleecker stop, I began to notice the intricate details of the carefully placed tiles in the station sign,' he writes of his project. 'Which led me to noticing other station signs and how they were all different, infused with the personality of the neighborhood.' The New York MTA Subway system - one of the world's oldest and largest - first opened in October of 1904, and its creators, George Heins and Christopher LaFarge, opted to use ceramic tiles to craft the signs because they would be long-lasting and easy to keep clean. Begin your trip: Mr Chang has so far captured 118 stations and aims to eventually cover the whole of the Manhattan network. His photos are organized online by train line (pictured) Intricate: The project is made up Mr Chung's digital illustrations of the signs, which he first travels to and photographs, such as this example (pictured) of a sign for the 81st Street Museum of Natural History stop . Old: New York's Subway system is one of the oldest and the largest in the world, first opening in 1904 - this sign for Canal Street (pictured) dates to 1917 . And they were right about them lasting. The signs have largely stood the test of time, with newer works installed every year on the network. Throughout several re-designs of MTA's network, including a major brand overhaul in 1970 which altered the maps and color coding of the lines, the mosaic signs have always remained immune to change. Many of the illustrative mosaics that appear were originally intended not only to be aesthetically pleasing, but to offer non-English speakers and tourists clues as to where they were going. Unnoticed: Mr Chang says he traveled the Subway for many years before he began to notice the beauty in the intricate mosaic signs . Practical: The signs were originally fashioned from mosaic tiles because they were long-lasting and easy to clean . Claim to fame: This station can be seen in the backdrop of David Bowie's 'I'm Afraid of Americans' music video, just one among several stops to have appeared in movies and videos over the years . Many of the signs Mr Chang has captured and added to his online gallery include snippets of long-forgotten, or never before told information about each station’s history. For example, the Lower East Side’s Bowery station, where the J and Z trains stop, houses a 'Future Doorway' which enables the construction of another opening - one that has never been needed as Bowery has historically been one of the most under-used stops on the MTA network. Similarly, the F train’s East Broadway station has a strip of mosaic around a quaint locked door, behind which is a level that was intended for the never-built Worth Street line. History lesson: The Bowery station (pictured) is one of few to house a 'Future Doorway' which was built to enable a new underground opening, yet to be used in this case . Secret: Behind this locked door (pictured), there's another level that was intended for an unbuilt line, captured by Mr Chang, who wants his gallery to serve as a 'tribute' to the history of the MTA . Some of the stations have appeared in movies and music videos. The 1 train’s Christopher Street station in the West Village can be seen in the backdrop of David Bowie's 'I'm Afraid of Americans' video, while the 1 and 2 train’s entire 23rd Street station on 7th Avenue gets destroyed in the 1998 version of Godzilla. 'I hope this gallery can serve as not only a tribute to the history of the subway stations but also as a quick guide to getting around New York via the MTA,' says Mr Chang. SubwayTileShirts.com is now selling premium T-Shirts which feature the tile designs for $38 a pop.","Adam Chang has illustrated signs from 118 stations for his NY Train Project .

"Tim Sherwood will watch Aston Villa from the stands on Sunday before turning his attention to how his backroom staff might shape up. The 46-year-old was announced as the successor to sacked Paul Lambert on a three-and-a-half year contract and his preferred No 2 Chris Ramsey is already in charge at relegation rivals Queens Park Rangers. First-team coach Scott Marshall will pick the side along with goalkeeping coach Andy Marshall for the FA Cup tie against Leicester City at Villa Park but their futures are uncertain. Aston Villa have confirmed that former Tottenham Hotspur boss Tim Sherwood is their new manager . Sherwood had been in advanced talks with Aston Villa and was without a club since leaving Spurs . Sherwood had been in negotiations with chief executive Tom Fox after the American targeted the former Tottenham boss. Sherwood is understood to have sought a number of guarantees before accepting the role, seeking assurances over finances and his position in the event of Villa dropping down to the Championship. His deal, which runs to summer 2018 and is in the region of £2million per year, suggests that those terms were satisfied. His first official match in command will be the visit of Stoke at Villa Park on Saturday, and he will be tasked with providing an immediate uplift in results with the club 18th in the Premier League table. A winless run stretching to 10 games is in desperate need of improvement. Paul Lambert was sacked from his position as the manager of Aston Villa on Wednesday . Gabriel Agbonlahort trains on Friday afternoon at Bodymoor Heath in Birmingham . Villa say the appointment is a long-term solution to an endemic malaise that has seen five successive relegation battles, pinpointing Sherwood’s good record at developing homegrown talent at Spurs. In his time at Tottenham’s academy, he oversaw the progress of Ryan Mason and during his five-month spell as head coach handed first Premier League starts to Harry Kane and Nabil Bentaleb. Villa owner Randy Lerner still wants to sell the club, and while in the process would like Villa’s academy to produce first-team regulars, with Jack Grealish and Callum Robinson two promising young players. Sherwood, who will face the media on Monday, said: ‘It is a great honour to manage one of the biggest clubs in English football. I can’t wait to get started and I’m really looking forward to the challenge.’","Tim Sherwood will be in the stands for Aston Villa's clash with Leicester .

"Mark Hughes and Sir Alex Ferguson never saw eye to eye during their spell together at Manchester United, however the Stoke boss turned to his former manager for reassurance that sparked his management career back into life. Hughes, who takes his Stoke side to Blackburn where his management career began on Saturday in the FA Cup fifth-round, endured a turbulent spell in charge of free-spending Queens Park Rangers before being sacked in 2012 after just 11 months in charge. As a result Hughes turned to Ferguson, who he played under between 1988-95 at Old Trafford, and points to a 90 minute chat with the Scot that reinvigorated his desire to take charge of a side again. Mark Hughes has impressed as manager of Stoke since a torrid spell at the helm of Queens Park Rangers . ‘As a player I didn’t ask too much of Sir Alex, really. I didn’t need to have a relationship with him to be honest,’ Hughes told the Sun. ‘I talked to him just before he retired. I went to see him after the QPR thing just because I had never done it before. I asked his advice, we talked football. I thought it was something I would regret If I didn’t do it because I was never the kind of player that would knock on his door and say “Can I have a word, boss?”’ Hughes was grateful Ferguson gave him so much time and hailed it as a turning point: ‘Sometimes you just need a bit of reassurance,’ added Hughes. ‘ . 'He assured me in terms of where my standing was in the game and that was good, he’s a huge influence. It was something I needed to do and I’m glad I did it.’ Hughes, pictured with Sir Alex Ferguson and Sir Bobby Charlton, played under the Scot from 1988-95 .

"Manchester City midfielder Frank Lampard touchingly swapped shirts with Stoke City teenager Oliver Shenton following their Premier League clash on Wednesday night after learning from Peter Crouch that the youngster had recently lost his mother to cancer. Upon hearing the news from his former England team-mate, Lampard approached 17-year-old Shenton after Manchester City's 4-1 win at The Britannia and the pair agreed to swap shirts. Lampard had to suffer the bereavement of his own mum Pat in 2008, a tragedy he later admitted left him 'in a daze' and almost unable to remember his performances at Chelsea that season. Manchester City's Frank Lampard traded shirts with Stoke City teenager Oliver Shenton on Wednesday . Peter Crouch told Lampard (right) that Shenton (left) had recently lost his mother to cancer . Age: 17 . Club: Stoke City . Position: Midfielder . From: Shenton hails from Blythe Bridge, five miles outside Stoke-on-Trent . Debut: Came on as a second-half substite in 3-0 Capital One Cup win over Portsmouth in August 2014 . History: Shenton's debut made him the third youngest player to ever appear for Stoke . Time at Britannia: He has been with the Potters from seven years old . His gesture to help comfort a fellow professional going through the same ordeal is a welcome sign that the competitive and money-laden Premier League still retains a very human side. Shenton made his league debut for Stoke as an injury-time substitute for Steven Nzonzi just two days after the funeral of his mum Mandy who recently lost a long fight against breast cancer. It is believed manager Mark Hughes offered Shenton the chance to be part of Stoke's first-team squad to help cope with traumatic personal week and the youngster took the opportunity. Crouch, who was part of the England squad alongside Lampard at the 2006 and 2010 World Cup, let his former team-mate know the special circumstances and typically the midfielder responded in a most sensitive and heartfelt manner.

"Real Madrid supporters booed coach Carlo Ancelotti and goalkeeper Iker Casillas but saw their team win 2-0 against Deportivo to stay clear at the top of La Liga. There were even a few jeers for an out-of-sorts for Cristiano Ronaldo when he blasted a second half free-kick over but the Balon D’Or set up the second for Karim Benzema after Isco had scored the first. Those goals saw Real move four points clear of closest rivals Barcelona in the battle for the La Liga title. See how they got on as it happened from our live updates: . Karim Benzema's goal helped Real Madrid to bounce back from their 4-0 defeat to Atletico Madrid . Host commentator . Three important points for Real Madrid - and it puts them four points clear of Barcelona. They, and Atletico Madrid, play tomorrow. We hope you have enjoyed our updates, now switch over to follow our coverage of Crystal Palace vs Liverpool HERE. It's currently 1-1. Cheers! That's it. Unconvincing but Real still win with goals from Isco and Karim Benzema. The worry will be Marcelo's injury. He ended the game walking around the pitch in just his socks after falling awkwardly. Madrid are already patching together a back four as it is and Carlo Ancelotti will hope he and Pepe are back for the Champions League tie with Schalke this week. Real left-back Marcelo is down after falling awkwardly in a challenge. Ancelotti will be hopefully this isn't adding to their injury problems.... Ronaldo almost makes it 3-0. Great run by Jese down the right, he crosses in for Ronaldo to volley but it bounces just wide of the post. Off comes Real Madrid's second goalscorer. Jese Rodriguez is on in his place. Juan Dominiguez comes on for Borges. He'll be suspended for Deportivo's next game now after he brings down and on-rushing Ronaldo a little outside the area. Bale will take the free-kick....and it's theatrically punched away by Fabricio. Not bad for someone that's renowned for being a bit greedy... Lucas Perez off, Haris Medunjanin on for Deportivo. Goalscorer Isco off for Real, to a standing ovation, replaced by Dani Carvajal. Ronaldo breaks down the right but he can't find Benzema to add to his goal. Straight away Deportivo break though and they win a free-kick on the edge of Casillas' area. That should be enough for Real Madrid. Karim Benzema makes it 2-0. Cristiano Ronaldo knocks on a pass from Arbeloa and the Frenchman dinks the finish over the keeper. That's the three points in the bag. 17 minute left. The Brazilian 21-year-old, signed in January from Cruziero, comes on for Asier Illarramendi. A 1-0 win over Deportivo with Ronaldo blasting free-kicks into the stand and struggling against a 39-year-old full-back will do nothing to change the mood in Madrid. We'll be in for another week of hand wringing and chin scratching if the result stays this close. Shot from Marcelo but it's easily saved by the keeper. He fought through a couple of challenges on the left and then shot when he probably should have passed. Benzema then sees another shot saved by Fabricio. They're looking more threatening but these efforts are weak. 21-year-old Helder Costa comes on for Oriol Riera. He looks unimpressed, although he has faded since a decent opening. Ronaldo steps up for the free-kick.... Miles over. Row Z. Isco made the difference at the attacking end earlier and now he's doing it in his own box. He proves Real's saviour to cut out a deep cross with an excellent touch. The Bernabeu sings his name. Real get down the other end and win a soft free-kick for Manuel Pablo challenge. He gets booked. A few injuries in Carlo Ancelotti's squad at the minute so he's relying on the club's youth to make up the numbers. Jese Rodriguez, Alvaro Medran and Derik Osede . Deportivo have to start taking these chances during a strong spell for the visitors. Madrid are now starting to get back into it as we reach the 55-minute mark. Slow start from Madrid again and Celso Borges hits the post with a left-footed strike inside the box. Moments later Casillas has to react brilliantly to tip away a header that deflected off Nacho. And we're off... Can Real Madrid add to their lead? Hopefully Ronaldo has his shooting boots on for this second period. Crystal Palace lead Liverpool 1-0 in the FA Cup courtesey of Fraizer Campbell. You can keep up to date with Luke Augustus HERE. Second half from Madrid coming up... They've looked a little vulnerable and Ronaldo's been all over the place but who cares? Real lead 1-0 courtesy of Isco's curler. Deportivo are playing some nice stuff but they can't get round that Real Madrid backline and particularly Rafael Varane. Real try to break quickly from a Deportivo corner and Celso Borges grabs at Toni Kroos and is booked. Ronaldo goes down in the box and is warned by the referee for his protests. It looked a lot like a dive - he could probably do with half-time arriving soon. And Gareth Bale is now down just outside the box - again the referee didn't pay any attention to his appeals. What is up with the Ballon d'Or winner? He's missed another chance here after Gareth Bale glides down the right, crosses in and Ronaldo heads over. He could even have left it for Isco to volley...that might have been a better shout. Cristiano Ronaldo may be looking a little out-of-sorts, and he's tackled out on the wing again here, but Gareth Bale is taking up his slack. The Welshman has already hit the bar and set up numerous chances for his team-mates, including Ronaldo's embarrassing miss. Ronaldo fails to finish from a yard out and Isco saves the day. It's a boost for the team but Ronaldo's miss won't have helped his state of mind. Deportivo should cave in now. Madrid need a big win after those boos at the start of the game. Isco curls in the opener to finally give Real Madrid the lead. The ball comes to him on the edge of the box and he gives Fabricio absolutely no chance, curling into the corner. Just before that Ronaldo had missed an absolute sitter on the line when set up by Bale - it looked like that opener just wasn't going to come! How is it not 1-0? Benzema is fed by Bale and his first time shot is heading for the corner until it's knocked out for a corner by a none-the-wiser defender. This time it's Gareth Bale...brilliant snapshot as he brings the ball out of his feet and Deportivo keeper Fabricio can only hit his effort on to the crossbar. Pressure building for Real. He was hitting the bar at his birthday party last week, now he's hitting the bar at the Bernabeu. Moments after firing a bicycle kick over he smashes the woodwork after getting on the end of Marcelo's pass. Madrid look to have woken up. The European champions are on the ropes here - it's all Deportivo. Former Wigan man Oriol Riera the latest to have a shot at Casillas' goal, but his effort flies over. We're underway and Deportivo are almost ahead already! A brilliant move down the right gives Real Madrid all sorts of trouble and Casillas has to get down at his near post to save from former Barcelona man Isaac Cuenca. It's been an unusually tough week for the Real Madrid stars. That difficult defeat down the road at the Calderon put huge pressure on the squad - who then went on to party the night away at Cristiano Ronaldo's birthday bash....perhaps not the wisest move. Today should be a slightly easier task though against a 12th-placed Deportivo side. Can the front three of Ronaldo, Benzema and Bale turn things around? The teams are out with less than 45 minutes to go until kick off at the Bernabeu as Real Madrid look to get back to winning ways after that embarrassing 4-0 defeat to local rivals Atletico. Real Madrid: Casillas, Varane, Ronaldo, Kroos, Benzema, Bale, Marcelo, Arbeloa, Nacho, Isco, Illarra. Deportivo: Fabricio, Laure, Pablo, Lopo, Luisinho, Alex Bergantinos, Borges, Cuenca, Lucas, Cavaleiro, Riera.","Real Madrid were beaten 4-0 by rivals Atletico in their last La Liga fixture .

"England recorded a 47-17 victory against Italy in the Six Nations at Twickenham on Saturday to make it two wins from two.

"The Sweet Chariot thunders on. England recovered from a false start at Twickenham and the early loss of full-back Mike Brown to maintain their RBS Six Nations title quest with a resounding win. Stuart Lancaster’s national team were behind for the first quarter of this match, as they struggled to generate the level of intensity shown during their seismic triumph in Cardiff eight days earlier. But when they needed inspiration, it was delivered in stunning fashion by Jonathan Joseph. Following his try-scoring heroics at the Millennium Stadium, the on-song Bath centre illuminated proceedings on his first start in a home Test. The 23-year-old scored twice – either side of half-time – as England made light of their initial problems to cut loose. Both his tries were acts of attacking genius, showcasing the pace and footwork which have drawn increasing comparisons with Jeremy Guscott, who was watching on from a TV studio.

Ben Youngs is congratulated by his team-mates as Italy fail to stop him from going over for a third England try . Once they had taken charge in the second half, England ruthlessly went for the jugular and claimed four tries in the space of 14 productive minutes. While a late Italian try would have been a source of frustration for the coaches, they will have be satisfied with a 30-point winning margin, after falling short of the title on points-difference in the last two years. The head injury sustained by Brown is a concern, but there were several performances to savour. Ben Youngs was an astute livewire at scrum-half, Joe Marler maintained his recent high standards, rookie lock George Kruis excelled again and Chris Robshaw led with now familiar distinction. Billy Vunipola was a rampaging force at No 8 and Joseph provided the show-stopping highlights. The anticipated script would not have featured an Italian try within the first four minutes, but that was the reality as the visitors surged ahead in fine style. Having contrived to lose the first two lineouts on their own throw, Marco Bortolami managed to steal a throw intended for Chris Robshaw and the ball was rapidly transferred across to the opposite flank. Sergio Parisse, Italy’s talismanic captain, made good ground down the left and after a strong drive by Leonardo Ghiraldini, Kelly Haimona and Leonardo Sarto combined to release Parisse again. The No 8 dummied outside and charged on through Dan Cole’s tackle to score. Youngs touches down beside the posts for England's first try of the second half and their third try of the match .

Tries: Parisse, Morisi (2) Conversion: Allen (1) Haimona missed the conversion but the Azzurri’s Kiwi fly-half continued to pose a threat to the hosts in open play. In the 13th minute, he picked a low pass neatly off the ground and chipped into England’s 22, where Andrea Masi claimed the ball and collided with Mike Brown. The attack fizzled out and there was a prolonged delay as the stricken Brown was placed on a stretcher and carried off. While the home side were forced into a back-line reshuffle – after electing to bring on Billy Twelvetrees rather than Danny Cipriani, who has previously operated at full-back – the break in proceedings allowed them to re-group and they began to impose themselves. There was another scare when George Fabio Biagi’s interception led to a defensive scramble, but the tide was slowly turning. A 21st-minute George Ford penalty belatedly put England on the scoreboard and three minutes later, they had their first try, although it was a marginal decision to award it. From an attacking lineout on the left, Dave Attwood sent Billy Vunipola storming into the corner, but he appeared to be held up by Edoardo Gori. Replays were inconclusive, but the TMO ruled that a try could be awarded. Italy were still coming to terms with that setback when they conceded another try which was a masterpiece of individual running class. It stemmed from a turn-over as Robshaw stole the ball at a ruck near halfway and it was sent out to Joseph on the right. The No 13 – now operating on the wing – left Haimona flailing with a nimble side-step and accelerated into space. He then shaped to pass outside, raced on past Sarto’s desperate attempted ankle-tap and away to score and bring the house down. Ford added the conversion and England maintained their 10-point advantage as Haimona missed two penalty shots at goal. Lancaster’s men then had a chance for a third try before the break, but Jonny May slipped and failed to make use of a two-man overlap outside.

After half-time, Ford struck another penalty but then – out of the blue – Italy hit back with a second try of their own. It was a gem, too. Sarto chipped out of defence, regathered the ball and ran on, before being tackled deep in English territory. When the ball was sent in-field, Luca Morisi ran a forceful line straight past Attwood and clear. He was half-tackled by Watson but leapt back up and went over the line. But the Azzurri revival was short-lived. In the 55th minute, England won a penalty from a scrum in front of the Italian posts and as the visitors switched off, Ben Youngs took a quick tap and dived over to score. Ford duly converted and landed another penalty just before the hour mark. Shortly afterwards, Joseph struck again. The ball came to Ford from a scrum near halfway and his canny, delayed pass put his Bath team-mate straight through a gap and his pace took him away from the cover defenders to touch down his second try and Ford converted before going off. His replacement, Danny Cipriani, took just seconds to make his mark. Jonny May scorched past tiring opponents on the left and cut inside, then picked out the supporting run by Sale’s fly-half, who claimed a try on his first Six Nations appearance for seven years. He converted it too, but was unable to claim the extras after Nick Easter marked his own Twickenham comeback by scoring from a lineout drive 11 minutes from time. Morisi added a late consolation try at the other end, but it did little to tarnish the English feel-good mood.

"QPR chairman Tony Fernandes has suggested that Chris Ramsey is on a three-month audition to prove he has the credentials to manage the club on a long-term basis. The former youth coach was appointed R's boss until the end of the season earlier this week following the resignation of Harry Redknapp. Ramsey was put in caretaker charge as Fernandes began the search for a new permanent manager with former Tottenham head coach Tim Sherwood and Michael Laudrup heavily linked with the post. Chris Ramsey has been given the QPR manager's job until the end of the season . Ramsey and first team coach Kevin Bond watched on as QPR claimed a 2-0 win against Sunderland . Ramsey has the chance to earn the job on a more permanent basis, says Tony Fernandes . Hull (A) Arsenal (H) Tottenham (H) Crystal Palace (A) Everton (H) West Brom (A) Chelsea (H) Aston Villa (A) West Ham (H) Liverpool (A) Man City (A) Newcastle (H) Leicester (A) But after impressing the chairman during his short spell in charge, including earning the west London club's first away points of the season with the midweek win against Sunderland, Fernandes has decided to place his faith in the rookie for the remainder of the campaign. The daunting task facing the 52-year-old is to steer QPR to Premier League safety and Fernandes says that Ramsey has an opportunity to secure the job on a more permanent basis. 'There are no guarantees in football. But Chris Ramsey has every chance to build a long term and huge managerial future at QPR. We are lucky,' Tony Fernandes tweeted on Saturday morning. Bobby Zamora scored QPR's second goal as they beat Sunderland to claim their first away win of the season . Zamora celebrates with his team-mates as Ramsey won his first game as caretaker manager . 'We found a great guy to manage us from next season, a dream manager, but actually we had a dream candidate right in front of us Chris Ramsey.' 'So we the board decided to give Chris a chance and he certainly has been a dream in such a short period. First away win. Happy players. 'He almost works 24hrs. After first team he takes eds and even under 14. He's modest, gets on with the job is organised, passionate and loyal.' QPR chairman Tony Fernandes will appoint Chris Ramsey as Rangers boss until the end of the season. Here Sportsmail look at five key issues he needs to address to ensure they beat the drop. AWAY FORM . Despite picking up their first win on the road against Sunderland last time out, the previous 11 matches did not yield a single point for Rangers. With Arsenal, Tottenham and Chelsea still to come to Loftus Road, their away form could be the key to ensuring their Premier League survival. LEAKY DEFENCE . Rangers have the joint worst defensive record in the league and, with goals also at a premium, tightening up at the back is a must. Harry Redknapp failed to identify his preferred central defensive partnership so finding a system that gets the best out of Rio Ferdinand and Steven Caulker could make the difference. SHARE THE GOALS . Charlie Austin has contributed 50 per cent of QPR's goals in the Premier League and that form has rightly led to talk of a potential England call-up. But Ramsey will be looking for someone else to help shoulder the scoring burden, especially with the former Burnley man not having scored in open play since the December win over West Brom. CALM JOEY BARTON DOWN . This may be easier said than done, with the combative midfielder becoming the first player in Premier League history to be cautioned in seven consecutive matches. Barton's leadership qualities and never-say-die attitude are far more beneficial on the field than off it, so avoiding suspensions is crucial. INTEGRATE A SQUAD OF EGOS . Barton, Adel Taarabt, Ferdinand. None of the three are afraid to speak their minds and they are not the only squad members with chequered pasts. Sandro and Mauro Zarate have also had high-profile disagreements with managers and Ramsey will need to forge a team ethos to stand any chance of survival.","Chris Ramsey was appointed QPR boss until at least the end of the season .

"Arsene Wenger insists the FA Cup remains a big-time attraction to Arsenal despite considering a string of changes to his side on Sunday. The Frenchman claims the competition has always been one of his priorities and revealed even his quest of the holy grail - the Champions League - has suffered as a result. Wenger is likely to make changes to the side that started the 2-1 against Leicester on Tuesday. Arsene Wenger insists holders Arsenal will be taking the FA Cup seriously this season . Wenger is expected to rest players for Sunday's fifth round tie against Boro, including Alexis Sanchez . Alexis Sanchez will be rested after taking a heavy blow to the knee against the Foxes, while new-signing Gabriel is likely to start in place of Per Mertesacker or Laurent Koscielny. Wojciech Szczesny will start in place of David Ospina, Kieran Gibbs could replace Nacho Monreal at left-back, while Jack Wilshere could make his return to action following a four month injury lay-off. Nevertheless, Wenger insists the cup holders are, as always taking the competition seriously. ‘It is important to us and we have always taken it seriously,’ said Wenger. Sanchez was taken off during the clash at the Emirates after taking a heavy knock and is likely to be left out . ‘We did not always manage to win it, but we have won it five times during my period here. Nobody has won it more in the last 18 years, so we have always taken it seriously. ‘Sometimes so seriously that we suffered in the Champions League after. Many times a cup game was in front of a Champions League game – for instance this week we play in the cup and then next week in the Champions League. ‘Many times we lost some players. I remember against Manchester United when we played against Chelsea in the Champions League three days later we lost some because we took the game seriously.’ Wenger admits it is a problem that new signing Gabriel does not speak any English . Wojciech Szczesny will start Arsenal's FA Cup fifth round clash against Middlesbrough on Sunday . Meanwhile, Wenger is concerned Gabriel’s lack of English could provide his side with a major defensive obstacle at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday. The January signing from Villareal has been taking three language lessons a week to ensure he is able to communicate sooner rather than later. ‘It is a problem,’ admitted Wenger. ‘When you don’t speak English and you don’t understand “Come out, come back, right left” it is a problem for a defender. ‘You need to know the key words. Referee. Offside. Foul.’","Arsenal play Middlesbrough in the FA Cup fifth round on Sunday .

"West Brom manager Tony Pulis refused to get carried away after the Baggies trounced Barclays Premier League rivals West Ham 4-0 to become the first team to reach this season's FA Cup quarter-finals. Goals from Brown Ideye (two), James Morrison and Saido Berahino ensured West Brom booked their place in the sixth round for the first time in seven years, but Pulis is at present unwilling to contemplate the possibility of taking the Baggies to Wembley. 'We mustn't get carried away,' Pulis, who tasted defeat in the 2011 FA Cup final as Stoke were beaten by Manchester City, told BT Sport 1. Brown Ideye celebrates in style as West Brom defeat West Ham 4-0 to reach FA Cup quarter-finals . West Brom manager Tony Pulis is refusing to start thinking of Wembley as the Baggies battle relegation . 'It was a good performance, we're very pleased, but there's still a long way to go in the league and obviously we need a little but of luck in the next draw.' Pulis was more forthright about two-goal Ideye and dismissed speculation the club's £10million record signing was set for The Hawthorns exit door during the winter transfer window. 'Even if we had brought Carlton (Cole) in, we still would've needed another forward to have stayed so I'm not so sure he would've left,' Pulis added. Ideye scored an impressive brace despite being linked with a move away from the Hawthorns in January . West Brom midfielder James Morrison scored the goal of the game with a sublime long-range effort . 'But he's done absolutely fantastic and there was a weight on his shoulders and scoring goals takes that weight off your shoulders and he's blossomed and looks a good player.' While Pulis refuses to look further than the next round, Ideye, who has scored four goals in three games, sees no reason why West Brom cannot win the trophy at Wembley in May. 'We were on top of the game today, we played very well from the goalkeeper to the attack so I think if we continue like this good things will happen,' he said.

West Ham's miserable afternoon was made all the worse by substitute Morgan Amalfitano's second-half dismissal and Hammers boss Sam Allardyce believes his side's recent fixture congestion has finally caught up with them. 'I would say it (the defeat) was probably coming based on what we've had to cope with over the last few weeks and I think it told on us today, there's no doubt about that,' he said. 'I have to give West Brom a lot of credit - they were very good. I don't want to take any credit away from them, particularly the front two today, but I look at the players and there was not the energy we know they've got based on all they've done in the last few weeks.' On Amalfitano's dismissal, Allardyce added: 'It's unprofessional, isn't it? The punishment is laid down in our code of conduct and by the Football League. 'That will be dealt with, as always, internally and we'll move on, but I don't think it's made any difference to the result.'","West Brom reached FA Cup quarter-finals with 4-0 defeat of West Ham .

Sterling has just over two years left on his current deal and Liverpool manager Rodgers said on Monday he is confident that the issues will get finalised sooner rather than later. 'Raheem is going to get rewarded. He has been offered a wonderful deal, an incredible deal for a young player. He is very happy here and you can see that in his play,' Rodgers said. 'We are certainly not going to be a club that gives out way, way above what they are worth. We reward our best players. 'It is very important for young players to have something to strive for and if they get too much too soon it will sabotage their development.

"The cruel fortunes of Andy Carroll got significantly worse on Friday with confirmation that he will miss the rest of the season because of torn ligaments in his left knee. It is a devastating development for the West Ham striker, who learned on Friday afternoon that he will require surgery for the second time in seven months. Hours earlier, Sam Allardyce indicated the 26-year-old would be out for ‘four to six weeks’ with a torn medial ligament, but subsequent assessment from a specialist ended Carroll’s campaign. Andy Carroll will be out for the remainder of this season after tearing ligaments in his left knee . Carroll injured his knee but had to stay on the pitch after West Ham had made all three of their substitutes . September 2012 - Picks up hamstring injury in his first game on loan - out for a month . November 2012 -Twists knee against Manchester United - sidelined for two months . May 2013 - Damages heel in the last game of the season - out for seven months . July 2014 - Tears ankle ligaments in pre-season - sidelined for four months . February 2015 - Tears knee ligaments against Southampton - out for the season . An operation has been scheduled for Tuesday. There must now also be longer-term fears for a player who has started just 24 times in the last 18 months because of three different injuries. Speaking before the scale of this latest injury was fully known, Allardyce said yesterday: ‘It is a big blow for him and us but it is one we have to cope with. ‘It is traumatic when someone is going through a period when in a short time they overcome one injury and another occurs. Asked about Carroll’s morale, Allardyce added: ‘Not very good.’ West Ham striker  Carroll hobbles away from Southampton . Sam Allardyce gestures to his players on the touchline during West Ham's goalless draw at Southampton . Carroll made his first appearance of the season in November because of ankle problems that required surgery in pre-season. Hopes for that comeback were high after Carroll scored five goals in 11 league starts. But the former England striker then injured his left knee against Liverpool on January 31 and it was on his return from that injury that Carroll, appearing as a substitute against Southampton on Wednesday, suffered his latest problem to the same knee. With West Ham having used their substitutes and down to 10 men, Allardyce left Carroll on the pitch to help grind out the 0-0 draw. With hingsight, that decision appears to have backfired on a player who cost West Ham £15m in June 2013. Adrian was dismissed after handling outside the area following an altercation with Sadio Mane . And Allardyce has confirmed that West Ham are to appeal the dismissal of their goalkeeper . It means West Ham are likely to pair Enner Valencia and Diafra Sakho up front in today’s FA Cup fifth-round tie against West Brom. Referring to Carroll, West Ham co-chairman David Gold said yesterday: ‘He was desperately unlucky to pick up a new injury.’ West Ham had better news from the FA, who have overturned the red card shown to goalkeeper Adrian against Southampton. However, West Ham have been charged with ‘failing to ensure it players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion’ following the sending off. They have until the evening of February 18 to answer the charge.","Andy Carroll has been ruled out for the season .

"This was brutal. This was a painful, embarrassing lesson for England in how to play one-day cricket in an age where they have been left behind in the 50-over game. One of the teams involved in Saturday's showpiece at the Melbourne Cricket Ground have every chance of winning the World Cup and it isn’t England. Australia were always going to be hot favourites in this opening match of the premier one-day tournament in front of 84,336 but this was much worse than England could have imagined. Do not be fooled by the late England runs once the tension had gone from the contest. This was an absolute demolition of Eoin Morgan’s side and their aspirations of springing a Valentine’s Day surprise, as they lost by 111 runs. England failed to win their 2015 World Cup opener as they failed to chase down Australia's score of 342 . Australia's Mitchell Marsh is congratulated by his team-mates after taking the wicket of Eoin Morgan . England captain Eoin Morgan looks dejected as he walks past Australia as they celebrate . First Australia made their highest ever one-day score against England, their murderous 342 for nine also being the most by any team against England in any of the World Cups stretching back 40 years. Then England made a pitiful attempt at making history by collapsing not against their nemesis Mitchell Johnson nor even the equally rapid Mitchell Starc but a third Mitchell in the innocuous looking reserve all-rounder Mitch Marsh. Steven Finn’s hat-trick, gained far too late to make any difference to the outcome off the last three balls of the innings, and James Taylor's classy, unbeaten 98 after the game had gone merely papered over alarming cracks. Let us be clear. It is no disgrace to lose to Australia in this World Cup. The hosts are a powerful, gifted one-day side playing a high-octane brand of cricket and it will take an extremely good team to stop them returning to this great ground for the final on March 29. England, in contrast, are a work in progress, having fallen way behind in a 50-over format which has progressed dramatically in the last two years while they have regressed because of ridiculous schedules and their prioritising of Test cricket. Yet it is disgraceful to surrender so meekly, to capitulate to the least heralded member of the Australian attack so timidly with little of the heart and character that must be a bare minimum for any England side. Morgan, pictured clipped a ball through to Australia's wicket keeper, failed to guide his side to victory . Australia's Marsh bowls during their Cricket World Cup pool A match against England in Melbourne . Australia's wicketkeeper Brad Haddin celebrates after catching out England's Jos Buttler . England would surely have hoped to show more signs of improvement than this, to have justified the quiet optimism in their ranks that has led to some of us talking hopefully of them as possible semi-finalists. Well, the flawed structure of this tournament means that this defeat does not really matter in that regard because all England will have to do to make the last eight at least is defeat Scotland, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. But this will be a massive blow to their confidence and they will not be helped by the prospect of their second game being against another very strong one-day side and a good bet to win the cup themselves in co-hosts New Zealand. The Black Caps warmed up by dismantling Sri Lanka in Christchurch. England did not help themselves. To have any hope they had to take every half chance that came their way but as early as the fifth ball Chris Woakes had dropped Aaron Finch on nought and hope seeped out of England. It was inevitable then that Finch would go on to score a match-defining hundred. It was not the only lapse by a long way. Moeen Ali got nowhere near a powerful catchable drive from David Warner, Gary Ballance, brought in at the 11th hour for Ravi Bopara, got nowhere near a skier from George Bailey and Jos Buttler could not hold on to a hard chance offered by Glenn Maxwell on 42. And to think that England’s fielding had been excellent throughout a tri-series that actually provided encouragement that they were on the up. Their collapse in the field, at least until Stuart Broad and Joe Root held difficult chances to give Finn the first two wickets of his hat-trick, was simply inexplicable. England's Steven Finn embraces James Anderson after taking the wicket of Australia's Mitchell Johnson . Australia's Aaron Finch walks past as England's team celebrates running him out during their match . Australia, in contrast, were magnificent. They are without captain Michael Clarke and, more damagingly, James Faulkner, but this is a squad brimming with one-day talent and ready to seize their moment in front of their home fans. If Finch provided the backbone to their innings with 135 they were also indebted to Glenn Maxwell for his late 66 off 40 balls at a time when England seemed to have clawed their way back towards sniffing a chance. Twice, in fact, England were still in the match, firstly when Broad took two wickets in successive balls in the eighth over, and then when Finch and Bailey fell without two overs of each other. But each time Australia powered away. Let’s clutch at some positive straws. Finn is getting back towards his full pace and finished with five for 71 while Broad is also nearing his best again. But the lack of a sixth bowler, exacerbated by the dropping of Bopara, meant that Morgan had nowhere to turn when his bowlers were suffering. The game was effectively over by the halfway mark, England’s death bowling letting them down again with an almost total mystifying lack of yorkers, but England needed to at least make a decent fist of their reply. Instead they collapsed against a man who would not even have been playing had Faulkner been fit. England bowler Stuart Broad  appeals for a wicket during their cricket world cup pool A match . Australia captain George Bailey falls after he played a hook shot during their cricket world cup pool A match . Once the rapid Starc had forced Moeen into an injudicious demise it was over to Marsh, no more than a medium-pacer compared to his team-mates, to cut swathes through the England batting line-up with ridiculous ease. Only Buttler could consider himself unlucky, falling victim to a quite superb diving catch from Steve Smith that epitomised Australia’s excellence and mastery on the day. Most worryingly for England, captain Morgan suffered his fourth duck in five innings and looks painfully out of form. When Buttler went England were 92 for six and facing complete humiliation but at least James Taylor, who did himself a power of good with an innings of proper industry and innovation, and Woakes showed some fight in a stand of 92 that delayed the inevitable. The innings ended in some farce when Taylor successfully reviewed an lbw decision only for the umpires to give Jimmy Anderson run out as the pair crossed after the initial decision. Surely the ball should have been dead once the umpire's finger was raised? It only mattered to Taylor's attempts to score his first one-day international hundred. Marsh, barely believably, ended with five for 33 on a highly satisfying day for the hosts and England, meanwhile, have much to contemplate before Friday’s game in Wellington after one of their heaviest defeats in any World Cup match.

"The International Cricket Council has taken the unusual step to confirm that James Anderson was incorrectly given out at the end of England's defeat by Australia in their World Cup opener. Anderson was adjudged run out in a farcical end to the match as both sets of players were left unsure by the ruling of on-field officials Aleem Dar and Kumar Dharmasena - who have both previously won the ICC Umpires of the Year award. James Taylor had correctly reviewed an lbw decision, but replays also showed that Anderson had been caught short of his ground and Dharmasena gave him out. James Taylor is given out lbw by the umpire as James Anderson is run out at the same time . The ball should have been called dead as the umpire decided that Taylor was out lbw . Taylor correctly review the decision and had the lbw verdict overturned . But the umpires concluded that Anderson should still be given out because he was run out . Anderson and Taylor seek clarification from the umpire as the players were left confused by the call . The ICC revealed in a statement, issued just over an hour after the game, that the ball should have been called dead and that they had met with the England management to confirm the error. 'Following Australia's 111-run victory over England in the Group A ICC Cricket World Cup clash at Melbourne Cricket Ground on Saturday night, the Playing Control Team (PCT) met and reviewed the final ball of the game which resulted in James Anderson being given run out,' the statement read. 'Article 3.6a of Appendix 6 of the Decision Review System (DRS) Playing Conditions states that the ball should have been deemed dead when the batsman (James Taylor) was given out leg before wicket (lbw). No further runs or dismissals were possible. 'The PCT spoke to the England team management and acknowledges that the game ended incorrectly and an error was made.'","Australia beat England by 111 runs in Melbourne on Saturday .

"England captain Eoin Morgan has urged his team-mates to 'stand up' to the next World Cup challenge of New Zealand after overseeing a humbling opening-day defeat to Australia. Morgan's men suffered a crushing 111-run loss in Melbourne after Australia plundered 342 for nine - the highest score England had ever conceded at a World Cup. The visitors could only reply with 231 in 41.5 overs and next up in Pool A are New Zealand, who host Morgan's team in Wellington next week. Eoin Morgan was unable to stop England losing to Australia after they performed poorly in the field . Morgan discusses tactics with James Anderson during their 111 run loss to Australia . Morgan told Sky Sports World Cup Live: 'They'll probably be the toughest two games of the group stage and we know they're a good test of where we're at. 'If we keep testing ourselves against the best sides and learning as the tour progresses, hopefully we'll hit our straps come the quarter-finals. 'But I think the senior players have got to stand up, myself included, and lead the way from the front.' The Irishman admitted England had fielded poorly, with Australian centurion Aaron Finch among the big-hitters dropped on Saturday. Mitchell Marsh celebrates dismissing Morgan for a duck in at the Melbourne Cricket Ground . 'I think we probably let ourselves down in the field - we didn't have a great day there. I think we needed all guns firing to chase down 340,' added Morgan. 'That's probably the most frustrating thing. We started a little bit slowly and a bit cold, which again has been disappointing.' Reflecting on the positives, Morgan praised Steven Finn following his five-wicket haul - which included a hat-trick - and pointed to the unbeaten 98 from James Taylor. Australia made their highest ever one-day score against England in their World Cup opener . He added: 'Finny taking the second five-for on this tour has been great and James Taylor was clearly very unlucky not to get a hundred at the end, as he struck the ball very cleanly.' Australia were largely indebted to Victorian batsman Finch, who hit 135 from 128 balls on his home ground. 'It was nice, a little bit surreal and it will take time for it to sink it but it's a great feeling to get a win first up,' he said. 'It's always a little bit iffy the first game of the tournament and there were a few nerves about but it's nice to get that out of the way. 'Everyone contributed right through the order with either bat or ball, or did something special in the field, so it's a great feeling to get this one out of the way and hopefully we'll take a lot of momentum through the rest of the tournament.'

"When Yakubu climbed off the Reading bench with this tie heading towards a replay, Steve McClaren embraced his old striker on the touchline but dreaded what was coming next. ‘I thought “anybody but him”,’ said McClaren, who once paid £7.5million to take the Nigerian to Middlesbrough. ‘He’s horrible. He only needs one opportunity, and as soon as that big smile was there I thought we could be in trouble.’ Age has not dimmed the veteran’s scoring instincts, although exactly what that age is has been questioned by some. Reading's Yakubu Aiyegbeni scores the second goal to secure their place in the FA Cup last eight . Reading's Yakubu Aiyegbeni celebrates his late winner for the Royals with team-mates at the iPro Stadium . Officially he is 32 but many were surprised to see him return to English football with Reading last month after spells with Guangzhou in China and Al Rayyan in Qatar. ‘He told me he was 25 when I signed him at Middlesbrough (in 2005) so I don’t know what age he is now,’ said McClaren with a smile. However, when Hal Robson-Kanu’s throughball gave Yakubu a sniff of goal eight minutes from time, if felt like there was only going to be one outcome. He evaded two Derby defenders and buried a left-foot shot in the bottom corner with unerring accuracy. He could have done it with his eyes closed. This was certainly an improvement on Yakubu’s debut for Reading against Leeds in midweek when his nose was broken by an elbow to the face.

He’s a goalscorer and we got him in for games like this. ‘The cup has been a little bit of joy in a difficult season for us. We’ll take anybody now, home or away.’ Clarke’s side had been on the back foot until Derby were reduced to 10 men six minutes before half-time when Stephen Warnock was sent off on his debut. Warnock had already been booked for fouling Robson-Kanu before he went through the back of Jamie Mackie. Given that his leadership skills were one of the reasons McClaren gave for signing the combative Leeds skipper last month, it was irresponsible at best. ‘Two rash challenges, two yellows, can’t fault that,’ said McClaren of the decision by referee Craig Pawson. Reading went ahead eight minutes after half-time when Simon Cox pulled the ball back for Robson-Kanu who brought it under control before curling a left-foot shot into the top corner.

Enter Yakubu. ‘Only he could finish like that,’ said McClaren. ‘His first touch was excellent and second one was even better.’ For Reading, it more than made up for a defeat in the Capital One Cup defeat at Derby in September.

"If there was one complaint Ronny Deila could have filed about his team’s relentless domestic form in 2015: Craig Gordon hadn’t been warming up much for the task of keeping Inter Milan at bay. Not a problem. Gordon’s incredible double save in the final minute of yesterday’ s win over St Johnstone confirmed that the Celtic No 1’s brilliance has not been dulled one bit by the tranquil days spent watching his team tot up a streak of eight victories.

With Celtic tiring on a poor pitch in their third game in a week and the hosts threatening a comeback, the champions were more vulnerable than at any stage of a run in which Gordon had been largely inactive. That is when the Scotland keeper’s unflappable class came to the rescue. His strong right-handed block of a Brian Graham header from six yards was excellent. When Dave Mackay returned fire with a volley, his reaction was a world-class save with his left hand to force it over the bar. It augurs well for what are likely to be his busiest engagements of the season: the Europa League last-32 ties against Inter, starting at Celtic Park on Thursday night. And the last-ditch heroics slammed the door shut on any chink of hope that Aberdeen had of being able to close the league title gap today. Leigh Griffiths and Stefan Johansen scored the goals that sent Celtic six points clear of the Dons, who visit Hamilton, and Inverness, winners at St Mirren yesterday. Celtic midfielder Stefan Johansen battles for the ball with St Johnstone left-back Simon Lappin . St Johnstone forward Steven MacLean slides in to tackle Celtic captain Scott Brown as he surges forward . If Deila’s men continue in the winning habit, it will be an inordinate ask for the pursuers to remain in touch. And should it turn into another title canter for Celtic, they can start entertaining themselves with a quickest goal competition. That is, if they haven’t started already. Griffiths returned to the starting line-up to score after 35 seconds in Perth, beating new colleague Gary Mackay-Steven’s debut effort at Firhill by three ticks of the clock. Griffiths, scorer in back-to-back weekend cup ties, missed Wednesday’s Premiership win over Partick through injury. His ankle was back in full working order and there was no chance that those scoring senses would ever be blunted by just a midweek break with the feet up. Saints’ sleepy start aided the cause as Nir Bitton’s perfectly weighted long pass went right in between Steven Anderson and Tom Scobbie to feed Griffiths. The rest was textbook for a natural-born finisher as he tucked his fourth league goal of the season past Alan Mannus. Griffiths had taken less than a minute to do what John Guidetti, the man he replaced from midweek, hasn’t achieved since November 30. It’s going to be hard for the Swede to state a case for anything other than spending the bulk of his remaining loan period on the bench. Celtic created plenty of openings with Johansen enjoying an instant rapport with his two new midfield colleagues Mackay-Steven and Stuart Armstrong. An enforced change did at least alter the intent of the home side and pose the threat of an equaliser. Murray Davidson limped off with a calf injury and substitute Chris Kane accompanied Steven MacLean in attack. Kane was immediately in action, flashing a header narrowly wide from O’Halloran’s delivery. Saints’ improvements still left them susceptible to the off-the-cuff class of Mackay-Steven, however. He and Armstrong have already been dubbed Zig and Zag because they do everything together. Johansen is tackled by St Johnstone's Steven Anderson (right) and Chris Millar (left) at McDiarmid Park . It could be a name, too, for one of Mackay-Steven’s bewildering tricks and St Johnstone would have suffered from one such manoeuvre had Mannus not intervened. A trademark shuffle carved him the space and his terrific left-foot strike was soaring into the top corner before Mannus kept Saints in the game with a fingertip save. With their Italian test looming, Celtic wished to secure three points with the minimum of fuss and without suffering any key injuries. The sight of van Dijk nursing a knock on his right foot gave cause for concern but Deila, who has higher hopes for Kris Commons facing Inter than Mikael Lustig, reported no fresh injury worries. By the 52nd minute, it appeared they had achieved the other aim of the afternoon by going 2-0 ahead. Armstrong clipped the ball into the box and Griffiths provided the knockdown for Johansen to take advantage of stand-off defending. Johansen shrugs off a challenge from St Johnstone's Steven Anderson (right) to score his side's second goal . Neither Anderson, Scobbie nor Simon Lappin got close to the ball-juggling skills of Johansen, who then unleashed a deadly finish with the right boot. It can’t be long before Player of the Year arguments begin and the Norwegian’s name is prominent. But, as Johansen pointed out post-match, you need match-winners at both ends and Gordon was required to turn into Celtic’s hero after St Johnstone brought the pressure. Scobbie’s run and deflected cross gave Gordon a nightmare ball to handle across goal and on the bounce. He used his knees to see off that threat but couldn’t prevent O’Halloran hammering home the rebound from eight yards out. Gordon’s proud streak of shut-outs and a run of 13 hours and 36 minutes without conceding had come to an end but he had no time or interest in dwelling on that personal setback. St Johnstone's Michael O'Halloran smashes in a rebound shot to pull one back for the home side at 1-2 .","Celtic won at St Johnstone to extend their lead at the top of the SPL .

"Jose Mourinho and his trusted backroom staff have a habit of badgering fourth officials and sparking touchline bust-ups with opposing benches. As Mourinho continues to create a siege mentality inside the Chelsea dressing room, there's little doubt that his inner circle will be backing every move the Blues boss makes. Here, Sportsmail discloses everything you need to know about Mourinho's sidekicks as they fight another battle against the rest of the Premier League. Jose Mourinho (centre) is flanked by fitness coach Rui Faria (left) and assistant manager Steve Holland . RUI FARIA . Rui Faria is a fitness coach with whom Mourinho worked closely at Porto, and took to Inter Milan and Real Madrid following his first spell at Stamford Bridge. The Portguese hired his compatriot Faria as a coach and video analyst when he was with minnows Leiria and the two have been inseparable since. Faria's responsibilities far exceed that of a traditional fitness coach, and he is often spotted out with Mourinho and even driving him around. Rui Faria was given a six-match ban for this outburst during Chelsea's defeat against Sunderland last season . Mourinho hired  Faria as a coach and video analyst when he was with minnows Leiria . Faria is alleged to have been the member of staff illegally communicating with Mourinho when the manager was banned by UEFA from a Champions League game against Bayern Munich in 2005. Mourinho is said to have snuck into the stadium and given instructions to Faria via a headset, before being wheeled out in a laundry trolley. The 39-year-old is known for being Chelsea's biggest pest to fourth officials and opposing dugouts. Only last week, after a 2-1 victory against Aston Villa, did Paul Lambert accuse a member of Mourinho's team - believed to be Faria - of being verbally abusive. Faria was hit with a six-match ban after Chelsea's 2-1 defeat against Sunderland last season following an angry outburst towards referee Mike Dean. Faria (left) was said to have communicated with Mourinho via an earpiece during Chelsea's Champions League clash against Bayern Munich in 2005 . Faria appeared to have something in his ear that he fiddled with during the game in 2005 . STEVE HOLLAND . Holland was appointed reserve team manager in 2009 and has worked his way up to being an assistant first-team coach. Usually a calm and personable character, Holland has been accused of sinking to Mourinho's level with certain actions on the touchline in recent weeks as the the Chelsea boss continues to create a siege mentality. Holland worked under Andre Villas-Boas, Roberto Di Matteo and Rafael Benitez before Mourinho's return in 2013. Faria allegedly gave Holland a briefing on how to help Chelsea beat Barcelona during the Champions League campaign last year, while Mourinho sent several players good luck texts. Assistant first team coach Holland (left) joined Chelsea as reserve team boss in 2009 . Mourinho and his assistant Holland react angrily during Chelsea's 1-0 win against Everton on Wednesday . Holland has worked under Andre Villa-Boas (centre) and Roberto di Matteo (second left) during his time . SILVINO LOURO . Goalkeeping coach turned assistant first-team coach Silvino Louro, who was the man between the sticks for Benfica in the 1988 and 1990 European Cup finals has also been at the Special One's side at every club he has managed. With Christophe Lollichon taking charge of the goalkeepers' coaching, Louro's role largely involves player interaction and specific training drills. Louro is clearly heavily involved in Chelsea's set-piece practice as Mourinho praised his colleague following Oscar's brilliant free-kick against Crystal Palace last October. The 55-year-old also seems to be Mourinho's calmest lieutenant and is rarely at the forefront of a touchline bust-up. Silvino Louro (left), here with Mourinho in 2006, played a big part in Petr Cech's progression at Chelsea . Louro (right) gestures towards the fourth official during Chelsea's 1-1 draw against Manchester City . CHRISTOPHE LOLLICHON . Lollichon joined in 2007 from Rennes, where he had previously worked with veteran Blues stopper, Petr Cech. The Frenchman did not play at the top level, but has seen huge success during his time in west London. There were rumours that Lollichon, a close friend of Cech, would leave during the summer as Thibaut Courtois began his career as Chelsea's No 1. Despite being in Mourinho's matchday dugout to assist the goalkeepers, Lollichon is often very quick to harass the fourth official. Perhaps one of the worst touchline tantrum offenders alongside Mourinho and Faria. Cristophe Lollichon (fourth left) looks on as Mourinho gestures from the touchline at Stamford Bridge . CHRIS JONES . Jones is the club's first-team fitness coach, and was named by Mourinho as staying at Stamford Bridge ahead of his second spell at Stamford Bridge. He works alongside Faria on the conditioning of the team after being promoted to his current role when Villas-Boas was sacked as manager in 2012. After graduating from Loughborough University with a sports science degree, Jones moved to Chelsea in 2006 after spending three years at neighbours Fulham. He began working with the academy and youth teams under Mourinho, moving up to first-team duties upon the arrival of Carlo Ancelotti in 2009. Jones, who has also worked with England U19s and U21s, joins a line of British Mourinho graduates at Chelsea following Steve Clarke, the former West Brom boss now at Reading, and Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers. Chris Jones is the club's first-team fitness coach and works alongside Faria on the training pitch . MICHAEL EMENALO . The former Nigeria international joined Chelsea in 2007 when Avram Grant was manager. Grant recruited the former defender from the Tucson Soccer Academy in Arizona, where he had been in charge of the Under 12s girls’ team for little more than a year. Emenalo’s first job at Chelsea was as head opposition scout but he was promoted to the first-team coaching staff last year and has made a positive impression on key figures at the club, including owner Roman Abramovich. In 2011, the 49-year-old then became Chelsea's technical director and has since been key to the majority of Chelsea's transfer dealings. There has been a debate that Emenalo's close relationship with Abramovich has unsettled previous Chelsea managers, but the Nigerian seems to have a good relationship with Mourinho and will often be spotted sitting just behind the Chelsea dugout at Stamford Bridge. Michael Emenalo is a good friend of Roman Abramovich and become Chelsea's technical director in 2011 . Emenalo (top left), seen here applauding Chelsea star Willian, can often be spotted sitting behind the bench . EVA CARNEIRO AND JON FEARN . Chelsea first-team doctor Eva Carneiro studied medicine at Nottingham University before working in emergency surgery in the Highlands. She studied in Australia, did an MSc in London and a thesis at West Ham. After working at the British Olympic Medical Institute, helping athletes at the Beijing Olympics, and with the England women’s football team. She joined the Blues in 2009 as reserve-team doctor before Andre Villas-Boas brought her into the first-team fold in 2011. Carneiro is clearly having an effect on the Blues squad as Mourinho has been able to name his first-choice XI for the majority of the season. First team physiotherapist Jon Fearn joined Chelsea in 2010 from Reading and now occupies a place on the bench alongside Carneiro. Fearn spent eight years with the Royals under Alan Pardew, Steve Coppell and Brendan Rodgers. Carneiro tends to Kurt Zouma during Chelsea's Capital One Cup quarter-final win against Derby in December . AND HERE THEY ARE ALL TOGETHER...

"The world’s fastest man Usain Bolt looks primed for the new athletics season, posting a picture of his gym workout. The triple Olympic and World Champion sprinter resumed training in October after an injury-hit 2014 season and proved he’s in shape with a post on Instagram pumping some iron. The six-time Olympic champion will hope to retain his world 100m and 200m crowns at the World Championships in Beijing in August later this year.

Bolt posted  a picture of him on a leg press machine on Instagram with the caption: ‘New Year, Same Mission, Same Goals #workneverstop #ForeverFaster #2015’. Bolt only raced officially four times in 2014, including the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow where he anchored Jamaica to 4x100m relay gold. Despite the lack of racing the Jamaican then managed in August 2014 to set a world indoor 100m record in Warsaw with a time of 9.98 seconds before ending his season prematurely to recover from a foot injury and train for his assault on the 2015 season.

"Freddie Flintoff has been confirmed as a contestant for the Australian version of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here. While he was renowned in his heyday as a talented all rounder, Flintoff will be forced to take his skills from the pitch to the jungle after the announcement that he is one of two intruders entering I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here! He will be joined by 2009 MasterChef Australia winner and chef Julie Goodwin, while Miss Universe Australia 2008 Laura Dundovic is already in the South African jungle.

Flintoff is now in South Africa and his arrival on the show is imminent . Miss Universe Australia 2008 Laura Dundovic is already in the South African jungle . The news was announced on Channel Ten current affairs show The Project on Friday evening when the panel spoke to the 37-year-old live from South Africa before he joins his fellow camp mates. After being asked if he was afraid of any of the wild life he may encounter during his time in the South African jungle, Flintoff's answer was simple: 'I'm scared of [cricketer] Merv Hughes!' he quipped, making the presenters burst in to laughter. Adding: 'He's the biggest animal in that jungle!' ‘We don’t get bugs and snakes in the north of England, so I think they'll cause me more problems then the eating challenges.’ He is however ready to take on the gruelling weeks ahead, saying he isn't afraid to eat any of the jungle cuisine, which so far has included bugs and pig snouts. 'I'll eat anything - I’ve travelled a bit in the past and I’ve eaten all kinds of different things' he said, before admitting it's wildlife he's most afraid of. Flintoff was still in his pajamas for the interview as it was very early in the morning in South Africa . The sports star is ready for the gruelling weeks ahead in the South African jungle .

Flintoff, who retired from international cricket in 2009, revealed that he isn't quite comfortable getting his gear off on camera, saying that unlike his fellow contestant Tyson Mayr who is often shirtless on the programme, he won't be as confident. 'I'll be honest with you, if I had a bit of prior notice I might have got in the gym and tried to get the odd ab here and there. My rig isn't too good.' he teased. 'I reckon if I sit next to Merv, Merv bumps me up to about a nine out of 10.

"Children mingled with cricketing greats in 'backyard' matches and Maori warriors shared the stage with morris dancers as the Cricket World Cup opened Thursday with a vibrant and quirky ceremony in Christchurch. Thousands of fans crammed leafy Hagley Park to see the launch of the first World Cup in New Zealand and Australia in 23 years, the formal part of which began with a lone bagpiper and ended with a booming fireworks display - the biggest in the city's history. The World Cup is the largest event Christchurch has hosted since an earthquake in February 2011 devastated the city's centre - only a few hundred yards from where Thursday's festivities took place, claiming the lives of 185 people.

Thursday's ceremony, which set the stage for the 20th Cricket World Cup, celebrating the love of cricket and the cultures of the competing nations, equally celebrated Christchurch's resilience as it literally lifted itself from ruins to host the opening and opening match of cricket's four-yearly festival. As many as 80 children were joined by famous players in games of backyard cricket played on four giant ovals, divided into 14 individual grounds representing the 14 nations taking part in the world tournament. Each of the four areas was overlooked by a stage on which cultural performers from Sri Lanka and India, West Indian steel bands, Scottish and Irish dancers and indigenous Maori haka groups - in total more than 1,000 participants, performed for enthralled crowds.

New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum, who lives in Christchurch said 'having the first game of the World Cup here in Christchurch after all it's been through is fantastic.' 'I think it's a wide open World Cup,' he said. 'The nature of wickets we'll see in Australia and New Zealand are pure wickets and that brings in the match-winners. Every team has match-winners and they can turn the game in 10 or 15 overs.'","ICC World Cup is being held in Australia and New Zealand for the first time in 23 years .

"Middlesbrough boss Aitor Karanka believes Mesut Ozil 'can be one of the best in the world' and suggests that a pressurised management style is the most effective way to harness the player's form. Karanka knows Ozil well from the pair's time together at Real Madrid, where he was Jose Mourinho's assistant and Ozil was a linchpin in midfield. Since moving to Arsenal in 2013 for £42.5million, however, the German playmaker has tended to polarise opinion among pundits and the Gunners' support. Mesut Ozil 'can be one of the best in the world' according to Middlesbrough manager Aitor Karanka . The Boro boss knows Ozil well from their time together at Real Madrid, where he was assistant manager . Ozil joined Arsenal from Madrid in 2013 for a reported £42 million fee, breaking the club's transfer record . But, with three goals in his last four appearances for Arsenal after battling to return from a knee injury, the Ozil of old could be back on song. Karanka certainly thinks so and ahead of Middlesbrough's clash with Arsenal in the FA Cup fifth-round on Sunday he told reporters, 'Yes unfortunately for us he's at his best now. 'He can be one of the best in the world, his left foot is amazing.' Ozil became an integral part of the Real Madrid midfield and acquired the nickname 'King of the Assist' Now, with three goals in his last four appearances for the Gunners, Ozil looks to be back to his best . And Karanka also feels that pressure is the key to Ozil sustaining this level of play. In light of Ozil's more sketchy runs of form last season, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger might be accused of having been too lax with him. Karanka explained at his press conference that Ozil was constantly pushed by Mourinho at Real Madrid. 'He needs a manager who puts pressure on him because he's the kind of player who is maybe a little bit relaxed when the manager is not behind him, and with us he was always perfectly good. Jose was always behind him.' Karanka has urged Arsene Wenger to pressurise Ozil in order to unlock the midfielder's best form . Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho managed to get the best out of Ozil while he was in charge at Real Madrid .

"The move to Internacional in his homeland was supposed to be a fresh start for former Manchester United midfielder Anderson, but the Brazilian will want to forget about his debut quickly. The 26-year-old, who once cost United £26m, signed for the Porto Alegre side earlier this month after cancelling his contract at Old Trafford following an eight-year spell plagued by injuries and questionable form. And Anderson came off the bench in Internacional's Campeonato Gaucho fixture against Cruzeiro on Wednesday night hoping to impress, only to have his penalty saved by goalkeeper Bruno Gassi. VIDEO - Watch Anderson miss penalty on Internacional debut below . Anderson missed a penalty for Internacional as the former Manchester United flop made his debut in Brazil . With the score at 0-0, the 26-year-old came off the bench and slotted his spot-kick to the goalkeeker's right . But Crezeiro stopper Bruno Gassi guessed the right way and tipped the ball over as it finished as a draw . The missed spot-kick in the 74th minute would prove costly for the Gaucho champions, who went on to draw 0-0 at the Estadio Antonio Vieira Ramos. After signing for Internacional the midfielder, who was snapped up by Sir Alex Ferguson for a big fee back in 2007 from Porto,  vowed to prove himself again. However, at his presentation to the Brazilian media he prickled at questions over why he had spent so much time on the sidelines at United. He said: 'Do you think I'm not fit? A player will always be criticised. I had injuries in the past, but I have to be quiet right now and answer in the field. Anderson disappointed at Manchester United after arriving for a considerable sum of money . The former Porto man dazzled in Europe as a teenager and was once named Europe's Golden Boy . 'I had a knee injury and returned to play too fast. I played, but the knees where not equal and I got myself injured again. 'It will be a pleasure play in a club such Internacional. I want to be happy as I was in other clubs. 'I'm coming back to Porto Alegre because Inter went after me. The president gave me attention. I was training but not playing.'I played for eight years for Manchester. I would like to thank the club. In my first four years I won.' Originally a creative midfielder, Anderson was once given the Golden Boy award after dazzling in Europe as a teenager. He has since dropped further back, and was criticised for being overweight during his time in England. However, his penalty record with United was generally successful, netting his spot-kick in the Champions League final win against Chelsea in 2008.

The injury-prone striker is expected to have a scan on his injured knee on Thursday but the early diagnosis was he will be out for at least two weeks. West Ham striker Andy Carroll hobbles away from Southampton on Wednesday night . Carroll had returned for Wednesday's Premier League encounter at St Mary's after recovering from an ankle injury. Carroll came on as a second half substitute against Southampton and was injured in a challenge by Saints defender Yoshida. The early diagnosis was grim, considering his recent struggles. Hammers striker Carroll has recently been out of action due to knee and ankle injuries . Manager Allardyce was forced to leave the striker on because he had already used all his three permitted substitutes. West Ham were also down to 10 men following the dismissal of goalkeeper Adrian for deliberate handball in the second half. Allardyce said: ‘The sad thing is the injury to Andy which we can ill afford. It’s the same knee (he injured against Liverpool on January 31). 'He got kicked in the back of his knee and he stayed on as nuisance value. We just hope staying on has done no more damage.’","Andy Carroll suffered knee injury against Southampton on Wednesday .

"Formula One driver Nico Rosberg is clearly determined to capture the World Championship he narrowly missed out on last season with some intense pre-season training. The German was just beaten to the F1 title by Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton last year by a margin of 67 points following the final race showdown in Abu Dhabi. In an attempt to reverse those fortunes Rosberg headed hiking to make sure he is at peak fitness for his title assault, with the new F1 season beginning at the Australian Grand Prix on March 15. Mercedes Formula One driver Nico Rosberg posted this stunning view from his hiking training on Tuesday . The German has clearly been working hard on his fitness ahead of the 2015 F1 World Championship . Rosberg posted a series of pictures on his Instagram and Twitter accounts showing his hiking exploits on Tuesday. The pictures were captioned by Rosberg saying: ‘Did some hiking yesterday with Dan. 1000m altitude 10km distance. Challenging route but totally worth it. What a view!’ The German has spoken of his determination to overcome Hamilton and one key area he will need to focus on will be his inability to convert pole positions into victories. Rosberg obtained 11 pole positions in 2014, winning just five Grand Prixs whereas Hamilton won 11 races en route to the title off the back of seven poles. However it was rivals Ferrari, with four-time World Champion Sebastian Vettel in their new car, who were fastest in the first three days of winter testing in Jerez last week.

"David Beckham was famed for his ability to strike a ball with his right foot and it seems son Brooklyn has been blessed with similar talent. The 15-year-old signed for Arsenal's youth team late last year and looks to have ability in abundance judging by footage the youngster shared via his Instagram account on Tuesday. Wearing the No 15 shirt, Brooklyn makes a forward run into the box before controlling a bouncing ball from the right. Beckham Jnr then allows the ball to fall across his body before unleashing a powerful half-volley with his right peg which the opposition goalkeeper does well to tip onto the bar.

"A Whitehall mole has sabotaged hundreds of raids against immigrants working illegally in Britain by leaking sensitive government documents to activists, it was claimed last night. Small businesses suspected of illicitly employing foreigners were tipped off after a radical protest group was covertly handed the hit-list. The Home Office launched a two-week crackdown – codenamed Operation Centurion – to target workplaces, including care homes, hotels and restaurants and construction sites that were believed to be employing illegal immigrants. Crackdown: Illegal workers were targeted . But the Anti Raids Network, a left-wing pressure group, said it had warned the companies to expect officials to bang on the door after being passed the paperwork by the mole, Channel 4 News claimed. The leak threatens to scupper the crackdown by allowing illegal workers to escape capture. The Anti Raids Network said it was justified because the swoops were ‘racially-profiled and unfair’ – a claim the Home Office said was ‘abhorrent and completely without foundation.’ It said the raids were ‘intelligence-led’. Activists said they had seen 225 pieces of operational intelligence in what they claimed was the biggest Home Office leak in recent years. One document seen by Channel 4 News highlighted nationalities in specific industries who are being targeted. Labour MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, said he was concerned the document listed 'particular nationalities and races' One entry described Nigerians working illegally in barber shops and another talked about laundries employing Eritrean nationals, described as ‘not the best nationalities for us, but a new sector nonetheless’. The documents reportedly said there were phone stalls in Northern Ireland which ‘appear to have foreign nationals working on them, some of which don’t speak fantastic English’, and there were ‘nail bars with a Vietnamese connection’. Yesterday morning, men waiting to be picked up in Ilford, Essex, for cash-in-hand work on construction sites were arrested as part of the operation – suggesting the sabotage might not have worked. The Anti Raids Network said the crackdown was ‘a clear attempt to demonise migrant labour and satisfy the right-wing political agenda on immigration and the EU’. It claimed the operation had been launched in the wake of the electoral gains made by Ukip in last month’s council and European elections – a suggestion vehemently denied by the Home Office, which said it had been planned some time ago. Labour MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, said he was concerned the document listed ‘particular nationalities and races’. Westminster sources said the details were suspected of being leaked by one of the agencies it worked with to crack down on illegal workers. A Home Office spokesman said: ‘I should like to be very clear that the Home Office does not engage in racial profiling and any suggestion to this effect is both abhorrent and completely without foundation.’ He added: ‘Our enforcement activity, conducted in conjunction with other government agencies, is intelligence-led and targets sectors of the economy where illegal working is suspected. 'We do not perform “fishing expeditions” and in the case of the current operation, we have worked carefully with employers who share the public’s concerns about illegal working.’","Mole allegedly handed sensitive government list to radical protest group .

Tottenham’s Mousa Dembele turned the 24-year-old with ease near the end of the first-half at Anfield, leaving the Liverpool defender grounded. However Sakho had other ideas, as he slipped he launched himself at Dembele and proceeded to grab onto the Belgian’s leg in mid-flight, similar to a rugby tackle.

Sakho's comical rugby tackle caused Dembele to tumble to the ground and the 24-year-old was booked . Unsurprisingly Sakho didn’t get away with his desperate defending, picking up a yellow card for his troubles. Sakho was also culpable in Tottenham’s first goal. There seemed little danger when Erik Lamela picked up the ball 30 yards out.

"Manchester United legend Paul Scholes seemed to get caught jokingly muttering an obscenity in the direction of former team-mate Robbie Savage on Wednesday night. Scholes was previewing Liverpool's Premier League clash against Tottenham on BT Sport's Fletch & Sav show when his former United youth team-mate Savage made a joke about Scholes' height. The 40-year-old looked as though he found Savage's joke genuinely funny, laughing along with the host, before seemingly muttering 'k***head' under his breath.

The former midfielder gives a cheeky look to those behind the cameras after his comment . Scholes then smiles as he glances to people in the studio, perhaps not realising that the whole incident had been caught by the BT Sport cameras. Savage has since responded to clip, writing on Instagram that he will have to 'make Scholes pay' on the golf course. He wrote: 'Scholesy called me much worse as a youngster... Top Guy! Will have to make him pay on the golf course now #Scholes #Sav #YouthTeam #Mufc #beckham #neville #greatbarnet' Scholes, who has been part of BT Sport's live football coverage, usually alongside former Liverpool midfielder Steve McManaman and host Jake Humphrey, seems to have increased his popularity with the cheeky comment.

Earlier in the show, Scholes slammed Louis van Gaal for reacting to Sam Allardyce's 'long-ball United' comments  - labelling the Dutchman's outburst 'bizarre'. The former England midfielder believes Van Gaal should have ignored the West Ham manager's comments, which were made following the 1-1 draw at Upton Park on Sunday. The 63-year-old turned up for his press conference ahead of United's game against Burnley on Wednesday with a four-page dossier, which he insisted dispelled the claims made by Allardyce. Scholes said: 'Why would you react to a West Ham manager? It’s different if it’s a rival manager like Chelsea or Manchester City's, but at the end of the day you're the Manchester United manager. 'I found it all bizarre to be honest with you, as I felt Allardyce's comments were light-hearted in the first place.'

"The hustle and bustle of the NBA season will take a backseat on Friday for the razzmatazz of All-Star weekend. This year's event will take place in New York with history to be made at the showcase event as brothers Marc and Pau Gasol will be the first pair of siblings to be voted in as All-Star starters. Ahead of the showpiece event at New York Knicks' Madison Square Garden on Sunday, Bleacher report have whetted the appetite by comparing this year's crop of All-Star selections with great's from the past. 2015 All-Star pick: Kobe Bryant; NBA Legend: Michael Jordan . Position: Shooting guard . These two are widely regarded as the greatest players of their generation and in the upper echelons of the sport's history. Michael Jordan became the face of the Chicago Bulls during the 1990s - inspiring them to a double hat-trick of NBA titles in two separate spells. Kobe Bryant has five championship titles to his name as well and is a 17-time All-Star. Unfortunately a recent torn rotator cuff injury has curtailed the Los Angeles Lakers star from appearing in the Big Apple though. The pair did come across each other on the court during the twilight of Jordan's career as Bryant was making a name for himself as a rookie. A young Bryant imitated his role-model Jordan's action on the court - with the similarities between the two widely evident. Even though the comparisons still remain, the pair are both seen as two legendary figures of basketball and rightly so. Michael Jordan (left) inspired the Chicago Bulls to a double hat-trick of NBA titles while Kobe Bryant has five championship titles to his name as well as being named an All-Star on 17 occasions . 2015 All-Star pick: Carmelo Anthony; NBA Legend: Bernard King . Position: Small forward . When you think of the New York Knicks, Bernard King and Carmelo Anthony are two standout players who have illuminated the franchise during it's famous history. King, during the 1980s, was a devastating runner on the fast break and a tremendous scorer - leading the 1984/85 season with an average of 32.9 points a game. Anthony may not be renowned for his ability on the fast break, but his ability to score from anywhere on the court makes him one of the deadliest NBA shooters around today . Although King preferred to shoot from around the baseline and Anthony frequently doing so from the wings, the pair both have iconic pull-up shots that define their era. King's career was curtailed by a destabilising knee injury, while Anthony too is currently struggling with health issues that could end his season with the modern day Knicks. With the All-Star weekend on home court though, the 30-year-old will be desperate to put on a show. Bernard King (left) was a formidable attacking force for the New York Knicks and Carmelo Anthony has followed in his footsteps with his ability to score from anywhere on the court . 2015 All-Star pick: LeBron James; NBA Legend: Oscar Robertson . Position: Small forward (James), Guard (Robertson) LeBron James' nickname is 'the King' and it's hard to dispute that. At the age of 30 he's a two-time NBA champion, a four-time MVP winner and a 11-time All-Star pick. The Cleveland Cavaliers star is a mixture of NBA legends Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley and Karl Malone as the small forward continues to transcend the sport. James' undeniable talents in a 6ft 5in, 200-plus lbs frame harks to memories of Oscar Robertson in his pomp - who could also score, assist and rebound. The former Cincinnati Royals (now Sacramento Kings) and Milwaukee Bucks star had similar physical characteristics as James as well as the same enduring athleticism. LeBron James and his current exploits brings back memories of Oscar Robertson (left) in his pomp . 2015 All-Star pick: Steph Curry, NBA Legend: Pete Maravich . Position: Point guard . 'Steph Curry with the shot,' is a popular present lyric from hip hop star Drake's song 0 to 100 and the point guard has had the whole of the NBA singing to his tune after a stellar season so far with the Golden State Warriors. The 26-year-old is a leading MVP contender after guiding the Warriors to the top of the Western Conference standings. Curry is averaging 23.6 points a game with 7.9 assists under rookie coach Steve Kerr. But it's not just the point guard's impressive statistics that draw him comparisons to Pete Maravich. Curry's ball-handling abilities are reminiscent of Maravich's during the 1970's for primarily the Atlanta Hawks and the New Orleans (now Utah) Jazz. From the criss-cross dribbles and pull-ups - Curry is the modern day 'Pistol Pete.'

"Robbie Neilson was highly critical of a tackle from Livingston captain Jason Talbot which left Sam Nicholson needing stitches on puncture marks on his face. The home skipper provided the biggest flashpoint of an eventful game at the Energy Assets Arena right on the stroke of half-time. With Hearts 1-0 up, Talbot was lucky not to be sent off for a high tackle that ended Nicholson’s game. Livingston captain Jason Talbot (left) kicks Hearts' Sam Nicholson straight in the face on Saturday . Nicholson was forced to get stitches after being left with puncture marks in his face . Livvy levelled through Craig Sives but new signing Kenny Anderson - Nicholson’s replacement - nodded the visitors back in front with eight minutes to go. Jamie Walker then got what proved to be the winner as substitute Billy King provided his second assist of the day, before a late Kyle Jacobs penalty proved to be a consolation. Tynecastle manager Neilson was delighted with the final result, but less pleased with Talbot’s careless challenge. He said: ‘Sam is going to be OK, but he has three or four puncture marks on his face. It wasn’t a great tackle and I’ve let the referee know my views on it. ‘The games from now until the end of the season are going to be really tough, tense and tight. We are playing against teams who are desperate to beat us. ‘Livingston played really well. We didn’t play great football but we were patient. Genero’s goal was first-class and Billy is a great player to bring on.’ Talbot (left) begins to fall to the ground having caught Hearts' Nicholson in the face . Hearts are now 19 points clear of Rangers in the Championship table, albeit having played three games more than the Ibrox side. And although this match turned into a slog, it edged them closer to the title they now seem destined to claim. Neilson’s side went ahead after four minutes when a wayward cross-field pass was intercepted by Walker and he cleared upfield, releasing Zeefuik. The Dutchman could have squared back inside for the onrushing Walker but took too long and found himself pushed out wide. Undeterred, he showed explosive pace to cut past Calum Fordyce and bend a terrific strike inside Darren Jamieson’s far post. And after that Talbot tackle led to a skirmish that rendered two other bookings - with eight coming in total - Livvy equalised early in the second half when Sives headed in. Nicholson (centre) receives treatment on the pitch immediately after being kicked in the head . The league leaders were slow to respond and the home side looked dangerous but Hearts eventually regained the initiative through Anderson’s glancing header from King’s cross. King then teed-up Walker, who finished well from 15 yards, before Brad McKay brought down Myles Hippolyte seconds after coming on to concede a penalty. He was promptly sent off and Jacobs dispatched the spot-kick but it wasn’t enough to salvage a point. Dutchman Anderson was thrilled to get a goal his late Hearts-supporting grandad Jim would have enjoyed. He said: ‘I looked up to my granddad after I scored and he would have been cheering that one. ‘Everybody in the family will be proud and I’ve had loads of texts since joining the club from the Anderson clan. ‘I was happy to make my debut and I was fortunate to get a goal. You always dream of being important to the team on your first appearance.’ Hearts' Genero Zeefulk (centre) celebrates with team-mates after scoring against Livingston .","Hearts beat Livingston 3-2 in the Scottish Championship on Saturday .

"Manny Pacquiao hopes to have an answer from Floyd Mayweather Jnr this week as footage emerged of the two holding talks over their £200million mega-fight. The meeting took place in the Filipino star's Miami hotel suite two weeks ago after the pair came face-to-face on the basketball court hours earlier. An announcement has yet to be made as to whether the fight will take place in Las Vegas on May 2, but Pacquiao told Fox News Sunday: 'I'm thinking passionately that the fight will happen. 'Hopefully this week we will hear from them and fix the fight.' Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao discussing their fight in a Miami hotel suite last week . A video clip had earlier appeared on Mayweather's Instagram page showing him and Pacquiao in private discussing the potential bout. He said: 'I congratulate him (Pacquiao) on his career, he had a wonderful career, and I have had a wonderful career, but before we leave this sport of course we have to make this fight happen.' And he wrote: 'From the looks of this video... I'm telling Manny Pacquiao that we have to give the world this fight.' It was believed that the remaining issues involved the broadcast of the fight with Mayweather contracted to Showtime and Pacquiao to HBO. But HBO president Ken Hershman said this week: 'We're here to stand by and help wherever we can to make this fight happen. We're not an impediment to that happening, and we'll do what's necessary from our end. Then, it's up to the principals.' Pacquiao had previously issued an ultimatum to Mayweather with the demand of an answer by the end of January. That deadline has passed but Mayweather's post indicates a deal could yet be struck. If it can't, the pound-for-pound No 1 will likely face Miguel Cotto while Pacquiao could face Amir Khan later in May.

"Chelsea midfielder Eden Hazard is officially the best dribbler and most creative player in the Premier League this season. According to statistics from WhoScored.com, the 24-year-old has made 67 chances for his team-mates, level with team-mate Cesc Fabregas and three more than Stewart Downing in third.

"It was around the dinner table on Boxing Night, during a conversation with his fiancee, when Simon Mignolet realised how his game had malfunctioned. He had just arrived home from a difficult afternoon at Burnley, a game Liverpool won 1-0. His return to action had been unexpected, as Brad Jones suffered an early injury, but when the Belgian goalkeeper came on he was indecisive and his performance lacked confidence and conviction. Mignolet had missed Liverpool’s three previous matches. Brendan Rodgers was vexed by his form and felt a spell out the team, starting against Manchester United, would benefit him but as he shanked clearances and conceded needless corners at Turf Moor, nothing appeared to have changed. VIDEO Scroll down to see how Simon Mignolet and David de Gea's stats square up . Liverpool keeper Simon Mignolet (right) celebrates beating Tottenham on Tuesday with his team-mates . Mignolet, attempting to save Harry Kane's strike at Anfield, has kept six clean sheets in his last 13 games . Then came the talk with Jasmien, his long-term partner, which helped reality dawn. Mignolet realised he had stopped doing the things that had persuaded Liverpool to pay Sunderland £9million for his services. Once he had clarity, the fight back could begin. ‘My family were over and my missus and everyone were having dinner,’ says Mignolet. ‘She said “Simon are you sometimes overthinking stuff?” Those were her words. She comes to every game. I said we think about things, but I didn’t really give a response at the time. ‘She knows when to speak about football to me and when to leave me alone. The moment she came up with that and then next day the coaching staff gave me the same words. That was the trigger in my mind that we had to say ""look, we have to sort this out"". ‘The next day I went into training and again we analysed the game. I was always looking to find best possible solution for situations. I was trying to find the right pass but I had forgotten what the worst solution could be. I have always tended to over think things and that came into my game.’ The Belgian, working hard on crosses during a training session on Thursday, was dropped in December . The Belgian keeper rushes off his line to deny Kane scoring for Tottenham on Tuesday . It had been a horrid season for Mignolet, one that had been filled with criticism from all quarters. Some of it bordered on the vindictive, particularly the insults from former Liverpool keeper Bruce Grobbelaar who risibly likened him to Dracula. Other words, notably from Tim Howard and Gary Neville, also hurt but it is to his credit that he does not want to settle any scores during this conversation. He would be within his rights to shoot back but he has made himself the bigger man, particular where Grobbelaar is concerned. ‘From all the criticism I have had, you pick the things you can take on board and you pick the things you can leave alone,’ says Mignolet. So would he shake Grobbelaar’s hand if he seen him? The 26-year-old has been in impressive form since returning to the Liverpool side on Boxing Day last year . Mignolet will face competition for the No 1 jersey from Brad Jones (second left) who has returned to training . ‘Yes, of course,’ comes the instant reply. ‘I appreciate what he has done for the club and he has been a legend all the way through his life. He has won major trophies for Liverpool. I will respect him for that. I respect every goalkeeper who has done the job as I know what the job is. ‘As a footballer the only thing you can do is show what you can do on the pitch and answers the questions on the field. I’ve never reacted when there has been criticism, and I’ll never do that in the future. You learn from that experience. You can become better for it.’ Mignolet, certainly, has become better in recent weeks and his input to the win against Tottenham on Tuesday was crucial, when he made a spectacular save to thwart Erik Lamela. If Liverpool are to get beyond the FA Cup fifth round this evening at Crystal Palace, his good form must continue. ‘The manager has shown his faith in me and confidence in me and he believes in me,’ says Mignolet. ‘I appreciate it. When you play for a big club, people will have their eye on you and to see when you concede a goal, could he have done better? That will always be the case and I accept that.’","Simon Mignolet was dropped from the Liverpool team earlier in the season .

"A simple scan could be used to identify patients who are on the brink of having a heart attack, claim scientists. They have discovered an imaging technique that can be used to light up dangerous blockages in the heart. About 200 Britons a day die from heart attacks, many of which were triggered by such blockages – a ‘ticking time bomb’ that there is currently no way of diagnosing easily. Scroll down for video . Telltale glow: The orange glow, shown here in a heart which has recently suffered a heart attack, could also be used to identify high-risk areas . But findings from a trial show a new test may be able to identify these patients, many of whom suffer from angina, so they could be treated. Scientists at Edinburgh University used a PET-CT scanner – normally used to diagnose cancer – to track a chemical compound known as a radioactive tracer that is injected into the patient’s body. The tracer, called F-sodium fluoride, was found to accurately identify high-risk areas in the heart by emitting a glow that could be seen on the scan. The areas most at risk are fatty deposits, known as plaque, in the arteries, which if they rupture will cause a clot that blocks the blood supply to the heart. The study, funded by the British Heart Foundation and Chief Scientist Office, part of the Scottish Government, looked at two groups of patients – 40 people who had just had a heart attack and 40 people with angina and at risk of a heart attack. Discovery: Dr Marc Dweck, a British Heart Foundation clinical lecturere and cardiologist who led the research, is pictured with the PET-CT scanner . The scan showed more than 90 per cent of heart attack patients had a lit-up area at the location of the blockage that caused their heart attack. Almost half of patients with angina also had plaque that lit up, suggesting a heart attack was imminent. BHF clinical lecturer and cardiologist Dr Marc Dweck, who led the research that was published in The Lancet medical journal, said: ‘We have developed what we hope is a way to “light up” plaques on the brink of rupturing and causing a heart attack. 'If we could know how close a person is to having a heart attack, we could step in with medication or surgery before the damage is done.’ Researcher Dr Nikhil Joshi added: ‘Until now, there have been no non-invasive imaging techniques available which can identify high-risk and ruptured coronary plaques. 'For the first time, we have shown that this is possible, and it has the potential to transform how we identify, manage and treat patients.’ PET-CT scanners are in many UK hospitals to assist in cancer diagnosis, but are not normally used for heart patients. Professor Peter Weissberg, medical director at the BHF, said: ‘Being able to identify dangerous fatty plaques likely to cause a heart attack is something that conventional heart tests can’t do. 'This research suggests that PET-CT scanning may provide an answer, identifying “ticking time bomb” patients at risk of a heart attack. ‘Nearly 20 years of BHF-funded research has led us to this point. We now need to confirm these findings, and then understand how best to use tests like this in the clinic to benefit heart patients.’","Researchers found a way to use a cancer scanner to highlight areas at risk .

"U.S. military efforts . against Islamic State have cost nearly $1 billion so far and are . likely to run between $2.4 billion and $3.8 billion per year if . air and ground operations continue at the current pace, . according to a think tank analysis. But a ramp-up, including more air strikes and a significant . boost in ground forces, could send costs soaring to between $13 . billion and $22 billion annually, said the analysis released on . Monday by the nonpartisan Center for Strategic and Budgetary . Assessments. 'Future costs depend, to a great extent, on how long . operations continue, the steady-state level of air operations, . and whether additional ground forces are deployed beyond what is . already planned,' said the report by Todd Harrison and other . analysts. Costs of war: Chuck Hagel told reporters the Pentagon has spent roughly $7 million to $10 million per day on operations against Islamic State since June 16 . Pricey battle: The reported $7M to $10M per day the U.S. government is shelling out for the strike in Syria helps keep the stealth F-22 Raptor (seen here being refueled midair September 26) in the air . Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told reporters last week that . the Pentagon has spent roughly $7 million to $10 million per day . on operations against Islamic State since June 16, when it first . deployed troops to assess the Iraqi military and advise its . leaders. The United States began air strikes against Islamic State . militants in Iraq on Aug. 8 and expanded them to Syria on Sept. 22. Coalition forces have carried out 290 air strikes in Iraq . and Syria, of which the U.S. military has conducted 265. U.S. planes are flying about 60 reconnaissance sorties per . day, and some 1,600 U.S. troops are being deployed in Iraq. The think tank's analysis estimated the cost of U.S. operations against Islamic State through Sept. 24 at between . $780 million and $930 million. That agreed roughly with Hagel's . estimate of the cost per day. If air operations continue at a moderate level and deployed . ground forces remain in the range of 2,000, then the cost of the . U.S. military effort against the militant Islamist group would . likely run between $200 million and $320 million per month, the . report said. But increased air operations, coupled with the deployment of . up to 5,000 ground troops, would cost between $350 million and . $570 million per month. High-intensity air operations with a . deployment of 25,000 troops could cost $1.1 billion to $1.8 . billion per month, the report said. Defense officials have indicated they will have to seek more . funding because of the fight against Islamic State. The U.S. used its stealth F-22 Raptors for the first time ever in combat in the first airstrike against ISIS in Syria. The $150million jets were used to bomb an ISIS command center in Raqqah. According to the Daily Beast, the Raptor strikes along with the Tomahawk cruie missiles launched from the sea cost around $79million. This is a sliver over the cost of India's recently completed unmanned mission to Mars, which coast $74million. Army General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of . Staff, said last week that the Pentagon's 2015 budget proposal . assumed stable or declining commitments abroad and some . flexibility to adjust military pay and healthcare and to retire . weapons systems. 'Commitments have gone up,' Dempsey told reporters, noting . that Congress has rejected some proposals to retire weapons and . adjust military compensation. 'So if you're asking me do I assess right now ... that we're . going to have budget problems? Yes.' The center said its cost estimates were based on publicly . available information about the types of aircraft and munitions . being used, as well as expenditures in previous operations.","Ramp-up with more air strikes and a boost in ground forces could send costs soaring to between $13 billion and $22 billion annually .

"Sky Sports customers would be hit with a staggering £10 per month increase in their subscription rates, or £120 a year, to pay for the new £5 billion Premier League deals if the broadcaster passed on the full cost to their ‘football viewers’, according to analysts. While industry experts do not expect the price hikes to be quite that extreme in the immediate future, there is a broad consensus Sky customers will pay an initial rise of around £4 per month, or £48 per year, to help Sky meet the rights cost. Even Sky insiders privately acknowledge that some of the cost will be passed on to customers. Sky Sports pundits (L-R) Graeme Souness, Jamie Carragher, Thierry Henry, Jamie Redknapp and Gary Neville . The Premier League announced last week that Sky and BT Sport will together pay £5.136bn for live UK rights to show games for three years from 2016-17 to 2018-19 inclusive. Sky will show 126 games per season (up from 116 now), and BT Sport will show 42, up from 38. But though the split from 2016 will remain much the same, Sky have paid massively more for their share in the new deal, or £1.392bn per year, up from £760m per year now. That annual extra spend of £632m every year will be partially offset by Sky no longer paying around £130m a year for Champions League rights from next season, which they lost to BT Sport. ‘Sky have made it clear they will do what they can to absorb the extra cost,’ says Toby Syfret of industry experts Enders Analysis. ‘But it’s a bloody big sum to recover’. Sky Sports have paid £4.176 billion for Premier League TV rights to show 126 matches . Mr Syfret added that if the total extra spending by Sky were passed on solely to sports channel customers, around 5 million of them, it would result in a £10 per month extra charge, on top of the current £24.50 for sports channels bundle. ‘But £35 a month is the last thing Sky want [to charge],’ he says. His company estimates that Sky could instead raise around £100m in new income per year by levying an extra £1 a month on all customers, in which case a rise of few pounds a month to all Sky customers would pay for the rights. Sources claim BT Sport always intended to give the impression they would bid huge sums - in order to force Sky to pay more, and then increase costs. Analyst Joshua Raymond, the chief market strategist at City Index, agrees. ‘Sky has paid 83 per cent more than it did last time for a similar range of match slots,’ he says. ‘Sky has been duped into over-paying significantly and its now likely that its subscribers will have to absorb at least some of the additional cost as a result.’ Sky's Soccer Saturday has become essential viewing for football fans around the country . Mr Raymond estimates subscription fees will rise by up to £4 per month each year for the sports packages. A third expert, Roddy Davidson of Westhouse Securities, says losing the Champions League was ‘a blow’ to Sky, meaning in terms screening English club side live in big events ‘all their eggs are in one basket, the Premier League.’ Mr Davidson expects price rises to be introduced across Sky’s customer base in a way that does not make it obvi-ous the cash is for the football. ‘In terms of visibility on how they achieve it, that’s another matter. Our view is BT played a cool hand here and Sky had to go big to keep the packages.’","Analysts reckon Sky customers would have to pay £10 per month extra if the full cost of the new Premier League deal was passed on .

"Job done, move on. England avoided a potential banana skin by running in six tries against a hopelessly underpowered Italian side but will wake up this morning knowing there is much work to do ahead of their visit to Dublin in a fortnight. Stuart Lancaster made no attempt to mask his disappointment after seeing his side concede three tries — the first inside four minutes when Sergio Parisse bulldozed over and the last just seconds from the end when Luca Morisi brushed past Jonny May — and the England coach acknowledged improvements must be made to claim victory over pre-tournament favourites Ireland. ‘If you had said to me before the game we would get 47 points I would have taken it but there was a soft try first up and a soft try at the end,’ Lancaster said. ‘I was disappointed we didn’t get the same level of intensity throughout the 80 minutes.

Joseph is congratulated after scoring his second try of the game as he put in a man of the match display at Twickenham . Ben Youngs is congratulated by his team-mates as Italy fail to stop him from going over for a third England try . ‘We want to get out of the habit of giving away a soft try at the start of every game because it comes back and hurts you.’ Lancaster was right to be disappointed. England did plenty of good things in this game, most notably another world-class contribution from Bath’s livewire centre Jonathan Joseph, but they were painfully slow out of the blocks once again while their defence was alarmingly porous at times. Mercifully, they avoided serious injury but spare a thought for Mike Brown, who will wake up this morning with the sorest head in the team, regardless of how muted the celebrations were, after a sickening early collision with Andrea Masi. The unconscious England full back required almost 10 minutes of treatment on the ground before being taken from the field on a stretcher after being given oxygen. He reappeared later on the touchline showing no outward signs of damage, but following hard on the heels of George North’s overlooked double concussion last week, it was the last thing the player, or the sport, needed. Youngs touches down beside the posts for England's first try of the second half and their third try of the match . Jonathan Joseph leaps over the line and scores a second try for England as Stuart Lancaster's side took control in the first half .

Tries: Parisse, Morisi (2) Conversion: Allen (1) England, forced to keep warm as medics attended their stricken team-mate, were clearly shaken by Brown’s 13th-minute injury — caused as he bravely dived to avert Masi gathering Kelly Haimona’s chip ahead — and it was 21 minutes before George Ford got them on the scoreboard with his first penalty. With England having to come from behind once again, as they did in Cardiff last weekend, Lancaster and his coaching team admitted there was cause for concern. ‘We’re all delighted with the result,’ Lancaster added. ‘We know we’ve made progress but we know to beat Ireland in Ireland we’re going to have to step up again.’ Brown’s exit forced Lancaster to reshuffle his back line and the England coach opted to bring on Billy Twelvetrees and shift Anthony Watson to full back, with Joseph moving to the wing rather than make the straight swap of bringing Danny Cipriani on at full back. It proved an inspired decision as Twelvetrees resumed his partnership of 12 months ago with Luther Burrell to produce one of his best games in an England shirt. No 8 Billy Vunipola barged over from a 24th-minute lineout peel and, despite television replays proving inconclusive, the television match official awarded the try and England were finally up and motoring. Joseph’s first try, courtesy of a superb Chris Robshaw turnover in midfield, saw the Bath flyer skip outside Haimona’s tackle before bamboozling Leonardo Sarto with some darting footwork and electric acceleration to purr in from the halfway line. It was such a high-class finish, some in the crowd compared it with Jeremy Guscott in his pomp. ‘We assess every player’s performance throughout the season and we’ve scored them on a weekly basis,’ Lancaster added. ‘JJ, of all our centres, has been top- ranked. As the season has gone on his case for inclusion has become overwhelming on his club form.’ Joseph escapes the clutches of Italy's Leonardo Sarto as he makes a break for the try line before scoring England's second try .

Brown left the field on a stretcher as he is given oxygen - it was later revealed that the full back had regained conciousness . Three years after making his debut as a 20-year-old before being told to go away and work on his defence, Joseph, who also scored against Wales last week, has been England’s outstanding player in the first two games. His second try, 61 minutes in, again demonstrated his keen eye for space and electric pace. He has added another dimension to England’s attacking play. ‘We felt JJ needed to work on his defence and his management of the wide breakdowns,’ Lancaster said. ‘That’s really come on but also his confidence and his presence in the team. He’s shown himself as a real leader in the team. That’s grown on the back of good work at Bath.’ Italy had a chance to claw their way back but two Haimona missed penalties deflated the visitors, who should have been dead and buried by half-time only for Jonny May to bomb a straightforward try when he ignored a two-man overlap after 36 minutes. It could cost the Gloucester wing his place. After going in 18-5 up, the second half proved more straightforward for England — bar a couple of well taken tries from Morisi — after Ben Youngs scuttled over from a quickly taken tap penalty on 55 minutes. Joseph’s brilliant second try, after some smart work from Billy Vunipola, Youngs, Twelvetrees and Ford, made it 33-10 before replacement Danny Cipriani — making a welcome return to Twickenham seven years after his last appearance — started and finished a sweeping move down the left. Fellow replacement Nick Easter finished the try-scoring for the hosts when the 36-year-old became the oldest England try scorer of all time, only for Morisi to leave a sour taste with his late score.

"A school project centered around the assassination of President John F. Kennedy has unearthed a previously unseen video - a re-enactment of one of America's most historic moments. Seventh-grader Alyssa Leverton immersed herself in all things JFK for a school project about his death and the conspiracy theories that followed. The report was so well done that it was featured at a state competition, a feather in the cap of Miss Leverton's principal Mike Merrell, who boasted about the comprehensive assignment to anyone who would listen. Scroll down for video . Reconstruction: The video shows an agent posing as John F. Kennedy, with markings showing where the president had been shot . Catalyst: The discovery stemmed from a school project by seventh-grader Alyssa Leverton, who had immersed herself in all things Kennedy for the report . Scene of the crime: Bobby Lemons' camera was rolling as he captured a federal investigation of the JFK assassination in Dallas - months after it happened . One of a kind: The Lemons' footage is the only known color video of the reconstruction . Bobby and Jan Lemons were no different, but they had something to add to the conversation - the only full-color video of a subsequent investigation into Kennedy's death. KTAB News reported that the video had been sitting in a kitchen cupboard in the Lemons' Big Country, Texas, home for decades. They said that they were a young couple when they visited Dallas in 1964 - months after Kennedy's death. As they arrived at the fateful roadway in Dealey Plaza, they found federal officials conducting a reconstruction of the murder. Mr Lemons took out his camera and . began filming as they witnessed an agent posing as Kennedy, with . markings showing where the president had been shot. It's the only known color video of the investigation. Planning: Officials can be seen staging the re-enactment as a man posing as Kennedy can be seen in the back seat . They didn't know what they had: The video sat in Jan and Bobby Lemons' kitchen cupboard for nearly 50 years. They were a young couple when they caught the re-enactment in 1964 . Hindsight: Activity can be seen at the window from which Lee Harvey Oswald shot Kennedy in the re-enactment video . President Kennedy smiles in the sun as he rides from the Dallas airport into the city with his wife and Texas Governor John Connally in a photo taken moments before he was shot . Until they showed the video to Mr Merrell, the couple believed that what they had was of little significance. They have since donated the video to the Sixth Floor Museum in Dallas, which is located in the book depository from which Lee Harvey Oswald fired the fatal shots on Kennedy. Earlier this week, the city of Dallas announced that it will mark the 50th anniversary of the . Kennedy assassination next year with a ceremony . featuring the tolling of church bells, a moment of silence and readings . by Pulitzer Prize-winning historian David McCullough from the . president's speeches. 'I think what we want to do is focus on the life and legacy and . leadership of President Kennedy,' Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings said . on Tuesday. Mayor Rawlings added: 'The tone is going to be serious, simple, respectful, and it's . going to be about his life.' The commemoration on November 22, 2013, will take place in Dealey . Plaza, where Kennedy's motorcade through downtown Dallas was passing as . shots rang out. Fateful Ride: President John F. Kennedy, First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy, and Texas Governor John Connally ride in a motorcade in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963 . The ceremony will begin at 12:25pm with the tolling . of church bells across the city, followed by a moment of silence at . 12:30pm, the time of the shooting. The Warren Commission that investigated the president's death . concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald fired at Kennedy's motorcade from the . sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository and acted alone. Rawlings convened a committee of more than two dozen Dallas civic . leaders to decide how to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the . assassination. He said the committee decided the commemoration should be . a tribute to Kennedy's life. He added that students throughout the city . will be learning about Kennedy and talking about ways they can fulfill . his charge to think about what they can do for their country. President Kennedy and Jacqueline Kennedy shake hands with dignitaries on that fateful day in Dallas, Texas . The ceremony, expected to last about 45 minutes, also will feature a . performance by the U.S. Naval Academy Men's Glee Club in honor of . Kennedy, who was a U.S. Navy veteran. Religious leaders will offer . prayers and a benediction, and there will be a military flyover. 'This is an important day in a lot of people's lives – this is true for people throughout the world,'; Rawlings said. McCullough has written acclaimed biographies of Presidents Harry S. Truman and John Adams. He's won two Pulitzer Prizes as well as many . other awards.

"Nearly a dozen members of the same Alabama family – including the mother and brother of a missing teen - have been arrested on sex abuse charges. The arrests are linked to missing mother-of-one Brittney Wood, 19, who hasn’t been seen since she left her Theodore home, just outside Mobile, to visit her uncle, Donnie Holland, in the Styx River area, on Thursday May 31, 2012. She was last seen in a car with Holland at Tillman's Corner. Two days later he committed suicide using a gun which Brittney owned. Missing: Brittney Wood hasn't been seen since May, 2012 . Since then 11 people, either members of the Wood family, or with direct links to it, have been arrested on charges including rape, sex abuse with children under 12, incest and sodomy. The suspects in the sex ring include Brittney’s mother, Chessie Wood, her brother, Derek Wood, Nelton ‘Butch’ Morgan, Dustin Kent, William ‘Billy’ Brownlee, Mendy Kent, Wendy Holland, James Cumbaa, Randall Scott Wood and Jennifer Moore, the most recent arrest. Detectives believe that Brittney may have gone to visit her uncle to confront him about sex abuse and have voiced their frustration that the one person who may be able to shed light on the alleged crimes has disappeared. Detective Eric Winberg told Fox 10 news in April 2013: ‘We often (sic) times look for that golden nugget. That one person that can make the difference in your case. Accused: Brittney's mother, Chessie Wood, is charged with two counts of sodomy and sex abuse of a child less than 12 . Suspects: Randall Wood (left), who's been charged with second degree sodomy, enticing a child to enter and second degree rape, and Brittney Wood's brother, Derek Wood (right), who's been charged with second degree rape and second degree sodomy . ‘In this particular case, Brittney Wood was that person. She was the person that could tell the whole story.’ Police were investigating the abuse before Brittney's disappearance. Detectives say Brittney exchanged messages on Facebook on May 27, 2012, with one of the alleged victims, in which abuse was discussed. After Brittney asked ‘how are you? Tell me what's going on. I don't know what's true and what you said’, . the victim claimed to have been raped by Randall Scott Wood, Dustin . Kent, and Donald Holland. ‘I love you, I’m sorry,’ Brittney replied. The alleged victim wrote more messages to Brittney on May 28 and May 30, but did not receive a reply. In October 2012 a police detective testified in the case against Dustin Kent. The court heard that Kent raped a relative at the age of 13 in 2008 while her father watched. According . to the detective, the father took the young girl out in his truck . claiming they were going to buy a hamster from a pet store. Instead they picked up Kent and drove to an industrial park. Disappearance: A smiling Brittney Wood pictured here with her child . Investigation: Donald Holland (left) committed suicide two days after Brittney was last seen while his son, Donald Paul Holland Jr, has been arrested in connection with the sex abuse allegations . Linked: William Brownlee (left), a friend of the Wood family, has also been charged, while Jennifer Moore, 32, became the 11th arrest in the case . Crucial: Detectives believe Brittney could reveal important information about the case . When the car pulled over, Kent took off her clothes and performed a sex act on her before raping her as her father watched, Sgt. Scott Congleton testified. 'She kept telling him to stop. He did not,' the detective said. According to AL.com there are at least four victims of alleged abuse. Officers claim some of the victims were under the age of 12 when the attacks took place and are related to those arrested. Lead prosecutor Mobile County Assistant District Attorney Nicki Patterson told the website that suspected victims have been placed in foster care where necessary. 'This is a more layered group than we have seen or uncovered here in Mobile,' Patterson said. 'Family members sharing their children, unfortunately, is not new. It is not that unusual from what we know.' 'If you’re getting to a third generation and people are still choosing to abuse, sometimes these networks take place' 'Everybody's main interest here is to protect these kids and do the best job that we can.' 'Most of these children are no longer with their immediate family members. They are either in foster care or with extended family.' Speaking to WKRG.com, she added: 'Pretty much everyone in this extended family was having sex with one another and having sex with the children"", . Det. Terri Hall of the Mobile County Sheriff's Office said:  'For just your everyday person, you just can't understand how a family operates the way they operate. You just can't. I can't even think of a word to describe this family.' Chessie Wood has accused her deceased brother-in-law of killing Brittney. She maintains her innocence on the sex abuse charges she faces. The accused are currently awaiting trial. Mystery: 19-year-old Brittney Wood, pictured with her daughter, vanished in May 2012 .

"NBC Olympics sportscaster Bob Costas is set to return to work on Monday after being off the air for a week with pinkeye. The veteran Olympics host started duty in Sochi with one eye reddened from an infection that he hoped would clear up quickly. Instead, it spread to his other eye, blurring his vision and creating a social media firestorm. NBC today said 'Today' host Matt Lauer will fill in one last time on NBC's Sunday night telecast before Costa returns to the hot seat. Poor Bob: The pink eye in the sportscaster's left eye spread to both eyes by Monday night of Olympic coverage. He announced he would be taking Tuesday night off . Sore: Costas said he woke up to find his eye was swollen and joked that it was as red . 'as the Soviet flag' Costas contracted the eye infection in Russia, before the start of the Olympics. During Thursday's broadcast, he joked about red, . watery and puffy left eye. 'Bear with me for a moment as I spare my . friends in the press office countless inquiries,' he said. 'I have no choice to go . all Peabody and Sherman on you for the next couple of nights since I . woke up this morning with my left eye swollen shut and just about as red . as the old Soviet flag. 'According to the NBC doctors here, it's some . kind of minor infection which should resolve itself by the weekend.

"The stumps and the bails and their Zing lights glowed bright red in the Melbourne night as Glenn Maxwell’s throw smashed into the wickets, ran out Jimmy Anderson and ended a wretched mismatch between Australia and England. Red for the shade of England’s embarrassment, red for the humiliation that stung the cheeks of their players as they fell to a crushing 111 run defeat to the co-hosts, red for St Valentine’s Day and the massacre that unfolded at the MCG on the first day of the Cricket World Cup. England captain Eoin Morgan had put Australia into bat and then watched as they ran up a massive total of 342-9. Jimmy Anderson (right) is run out to complete England's humiliation in their World Cup opener on Saturday . Nobody has ever scored that many runs against England in a World Cup before. Even the Australians, in all the beatings they have handed out to us in one-day internationals, have never amassed a total that big. We might not have been expecting an awful lot from England against the tournament favourites but, let’s be honest, we were expecting more than this. This was a no-contest. It was a walkover. It was circus entertainment for the Aussies who crammed into this magnificent arena and got to guffaw at the ineptitude of the Poms. There were times, sadly, when England were comically bad. Chris Woakes put down an easy catch offered up by Aaron Finch from the fifth ball of Australia’s innings. Finch went on to make 135. Moeen Ali missed a chance to catch David Warner. Jos Buttler dropped Maxwell. Steven Finn claimed a hat-trick with the last three balls of the Australia innings but it was probably the most futile hat-trick in cricket history. Australia’s batsmen had taken the game away from England by then. England’s ‘death bowling’ was poor again. They conceded 105 runs off the last 10 overs. And too many of their batsmen gave their wickets away too easily and too cheaply. That included captain Morgan, out for another duck. By the end, the 84,000 fans at the MCG almost seemed to feel sorry for England. There was even applause for the gutsy James Taylor as he launched a one-man assault on the Australian total, a lone brave fighting overwhelming odds. Paceman Steven Finn was one of the England bowlers who felt the full force of the Australian onslaught . Australian opener Aaron Finch was dropped on nought and went on to make 135 . The umpires seemed to want to put England out of their misery, too. They ended the match by giving both Taylor and Anderson out off the same delivery, Taylor lbw and Anderson run out. It turned out both decisions were wrong. Taylor, who was on 98, called for a review of the lbw decision and was reprieved. Replays then showed Maxwell’s throw had beaten Anderson but it was later agreed that the ball should have been dead as soon as the umpire raised his finger to dismiss Taylor. The ICC got lucky. It wasn’t as if the match was close. It wasn’t as if the mistake affected the result, although it probably cost Taylor the century he deserved. But the game was already over. England were only trying to prolong a slow death. England never recovered from Chris Woakes failing to take an easy catch in the first over . Yes, the Australians played brilliantly. Finch produced a masterclass in power hitting, racing to a magnificent century on his World Cup debut. Steve Smith produced one of the best catches this ground has ever witnessed to claim the wicket of Buttler. The three Mitchells — Johnson, Marsh and Starc — bowled with hostility and precision. But England made the victory an awful lot easier than it should have been. They made it feel like a capitulation, not just a defeat. ‘Here goes,’ former England skipper, Michael Vaughan, wrote on Twitter as England’s wickets started to fall. He posted a link to a picture. It was a white flag being run up a pole. This may only have been England’s first match of this World Cup but even though they are still almost certain to qualify for the quarter-finals, it still felt like a desperately bleak performance. Finch (left) produced a masterclass in power hitting, racing to a magnificent century . It feels as though so much has been squandered in the past five years since Andrew Strauss and Alastair Cook led England to that emphatic Ashes triumph in Australia. So much has been lost. So much has been frittered away in the petty infighting over Kevin Pietersen which has drained the team of energy and talent and lingered as a reminder of the way we were. Once, England seemed upwardly mobile and ready to step into the gap the great Australian side of Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath and Ricky Ponting had left behind. Those hopes are distant memories now. England, particularly on the one-day stage, are a team who have fallen far, far behind. They were outplayed by the Australians in every department. They are a team shot through with confusion, indecision and uncertainty. All those faults were on view here yesterday. Mitch Marsh (right) celebrates as Eoin Morgan is dismissed for a six-ball duck, his fourth in five innings . England captain Morgan looks dejected as he walks past Australia while they celebrate . It was a brutal illustration of just how wide is the chasm between these two cricketing nations at the moment. England are not closing the gap on their old enemy. The gap is getting wider. There is no point pretending that Cook had made a strong case for retaining the limited overs captaincy before he was sacked last December but his removal appears to have made things even worse. There is an authority vacuum. There is a lack of coherence in decision-making. So, for the first match of the tournament, when most teams are seeking to build on an established formula, England made changes. Ravi Bopara was dropped, Gary Ballance was brought in at No 3, Taylor was moved down the order to six. Australian bowler Marsh is congratulated by his team-mates after taking the wicket of Morgan . Stuart Broad, not Woakes, opened the bowling with Anderson. They are not the most controversial decisions in themselves but they do not suggest an awful lot of joined-up thinking. ‘England really do make things difficult for themselves,’ Vaughan wrote later. ‘Change of batting line-up and team really does send a wrong message. Muddled thinking creates confusion.’ Quite how England regroup from here remains to be seen. They face an in-form New Zealand side in Wellington on Friday before travelling to Christchurch and the potential banana skin of a match against Scotland. England’s heaviest World Cup defeat came against South Africa in 1999 when they lost by 122 runs. At least they dodged that record. In the search for positives from the humiliation at the MCG, that is about as good as it gets. Mitchell Starc runs past the crowd with his finger up high after catching England's Ian Bell . James Taylor did not know whether to blame bungling team-mates or bumbling umpires for being denied a maiden one-day international hundred at the MCG. The batsman was stranded on 98 not out after running out of partners, though umpires Aleem Dar and Kumar Dharmasena must shoulder the blame for a farcical end to the match. Taylor was given out lbw but, even though his review was successful, the umpires decreed that James Anderson was dismissed via a run out in the same passage of play — when, in fact, a dead ball should have been called. James Anderson and team-mate James Taylor talk to the umpires at the end of their defeat . Chris Woakes was holding his head in shame after spilling Aussie opener Aaron Finch on 0 in the first over. Finch made Woakes and England pay with a devastating 135 off 128 deliveries to take the game beyond Eoin Morgan’s men. Steven Finn added his name to the World Cup roll of honour after bagging a hat-trick — but they won’t go down as the best three wickets he has ever taken. Brad Haddin was first to go, holing out to deep third man, where Stuart Broad took a terrific catch. Joe Root’s catch to snare Glenn Maxwell was even better and Mitchell Johnson completed the hat-trick, picking out Anderson at mid-off as a sheepish-looking Finn celebrated only the eighth hat-trick in the history of the competition.

"Stuart Lancaster hailed Mike Brown’s bravery following the sickening head injury which left the England full back unconscious on the Twickenham turf needing seven minutes of treatment before being taken off on a stretcher.

"That was a tough day. I feel dejected now and I will be until we train again because you build up in your mind what might happen and it was not to be. Australia were very strong and their win percentage has been about 80 per cent for the last year, so they were favourites going into this first World Cup match — but we should have done better. However well you bat and bowl there is no real excuse when you field poorly because that’s something that is totally controlled by us. So we let ourselves down a bit there and maybe that was a result of big-occasion nerves, which is understandable. People sometimes think of professional sportsmen as robots but if you put anyone under a high catch in front of 85,000 people it’s a nerve-racking experience. Stuart Broad is bowled by Mitchell Starc of Australia during the World Cup match on Saturday . Our big chance came when they were about 220-odd for five. We had our opportunities. But the death overs now are really hard work. If someone gets going there is always a boundary option and Glenn Maxwell and Brad Haddin played really nicely. We just lacked a bit of killer extinct. Does that come with experience? It’s OK to make mistakes once but if we make them again it’s a problem, so Friday against New Zealand is a big day for us. Our two toughest games are our first two, there’s no doubt about that, so that even if, God forbid, we lose again it won’t be the end of the world but we need to improve a lot and we will be aiming to do that in time for our next game. Broad and captain Eoin Morgan celebrate the dismissal of Australia's Shane Watson . Doing it at the death . So what about our death bowling? Well, the talk at the MCG is that you have to try to make the batsmen hit square because it’s 64 metres straight and 84 metres wide. The guidance here is that it is best to stay on the short side. Paceman Steven Finn was one of the England bowlers who felt the full force of the Australian onslaught . Here’s a stat for you. South Africa are the best in the world at death bowling and they go at an average of 5.8 runs as compared with our 8.0 in the last 10 overs. So what’s making them better? The world average is 30 to 40 per cent yorkers in those last overs in the modern game and what’s South Africa’s percentage? 12 per cent. They bowl length outside off-stump. In Adelaide the plan will be to get the ball full and straight because it’s longer straight than wide. If the Aussies had bowled first in this game they would have bowled short, no doubt. With only four men out, it’s tough whatever you do, but we have to have a think because we can’t keep leaking 80, 90, 100 in the last 10 overs. Taylor's tough luck . I felt for James Taylor today. The game may have gone by the time Jimmy Anderson was given run-out, but a hundred against Australia at the MCG could be a life-changing experience and it’s sad that human error has denied him that. It’s clearly a grey area and they might have to think of balls like that as a let, like in tennis. Titch was very good about it afterwards, but it was a great shame for him. Jimmy Anderson (right) is run out to complete England's humiliation in their World Cup opener on Saturday . Finn's hat-trick . It was great for Steven Finn to get a hat-trick. I’ve never felt under as much pressure under a catch as I was for the first dismissal of that hat-trick. I was getting so much stick from the crowd — worse than last year — and all I could hear as the ball went up was booing and jeering. Thankfully I kept hold of it! Australian opener Aaron Finch was dropped on nought and went on to make 135 . Keeping the faith . Everybody was gutted after the game. We know we’re better than that. It was always going to be a tough ask but we could have applied ourselves a lot better. But don’t lose the faith. This team has something about them. The captain might be in the middle of a run of low scores but you just know with Eoin Morgan that when it really matters he could suddenly hit 60 and win you the game. He’s that sort of guy. A win on Friday would relax the camp but New Zealand on their own patch will be tough. We’re tight as a group. Everyone is together. We will find our way.

"The plane carrying Latin singer Jenni Rivera was revealed to have malfunctioned in 2005 as it is now believed that the Rivera and six others died when the plane crashed on Sunday.

"An entire family who work for Avon say the door-to-door cosmetics giant has funded their luxurious lifestyle of sumptuous holidays, cars, shopping and even a new home. The Shaws, dubbed the Avon family, say they 'don't think twice' about jetting off to places like the Algarve in Portugal, Spain and Cyprus. Mother Erena, 48, was able to pay cash for a car and a brand new kitchen and conservatory for their Northampton home after becoming a sales leader for the firm and raking in £52,000 a year. The Avon Family: The Shaws say they fund their luxury lifestyle by all selling Avon products. Aimee (right), Zoe (left) and mother and father Erena and Dave will soon be joined by  Charlotte, 13,(second from right) Her husband Dave, 52, followed suit and also got a job at Avon after he was made redundant from his role as head of purchasing at a local brewery. The couple's two daughters, Amy, 27, and Zoe, 25, grew up surrounded by beauty products and when they turned 18 they too signed up, spending around five to 10 hours a week knocking on doors. Erena and Dave's youngest daughter Charlotte, 13, has been nicknamed the 'Avon baby' and they expect her to follow them into what they call the 'family business'. Ding dong: The Shaws were even able to afford a deposit for a house thanks to the cosmetics giant . Zoe said: 'Our friends all thought it was funny at first, and some were quite scathing, but now they have seen how well we have done.' The girls have managed to get themselves onto the property ladder after their parents were able to give them a deposit with money saved from their Avon earnings. And the sisters, who both have full-time jobs as well as working for the beauty company, have enough spare cash to run the three-bedroomed semi-detached house in their home town of Northampton, East Midlands. Zoe, a customer service advisor, is also saving for a car, while Amy, a legal worker, prefers to spend on bags, shoes and clothes. Sales representatives make £1 for . every £4 sold. The highest earning Avon Sales Leaders make over . £100,000 a year. Others who do it part time may only make £500 a month. Dave and Erena work anything between 20 to 40 hours a week. Erena, who has worked at Avon for 12-years, said: 'I started work at Avon soon after I unexpectedly got pregnant with my youngest daughter Charlotte. 'I decided I wanted to stay at home with her, but I found myself wanting to go out and meet people, so I signed up to Avon as a sales rep.' In her first year Erena worked just a few hours a week but was able to save enough to pay for a family holiday to Cyprus. Erena loved her new job so much that after just ten months she progressed to the position of sales leader, and now makes £52,000 a year. Two years ago husband Dave was made redundant and instead of looking for another job he decided to follow his wife and become an Avon rep himself. Avon sells over 3.5 billion products a year to 300 million customers . Plush: Erena bought the rest of the family on board and earns £52,000 a year . Jet-set: The family's luxury holidays include locations like the Algarve in Portugal . Erena . added: 'We decided that Dave would do all the stuff I'd been doing, . such as the school runs, and fit Avon around it. Balancing work and . family life could be stressful. He worked long hours and late nights.' 'The flexibility at Avon means that he can spend as much time with Charlotte as he likes and earn cash when he chooses.' The Shaw family  at home. All the family are involved in the selling of Avon products . Dave was made redundant on December 30 2010 and has helped with Avon ever since Erena started her business. He became an Avon Representative in January 2011 and a few months later became a Sales Leader. Zoe said: 'Charlotte loves all the Avon stuff, especially all the Hello Kitty products. Being a teenager she also really likes the skincare range. I'm sure she'll start working for Avon some time soon too.' Amy started working for Avon aged 18 when she was chosen to represent her county on a girl guides camp in America and needed to raise £2,000 to do so. She was soon able to achieve her goal and has been working for the company ever since. Zoe added: 'Because of Avon I have my spare cash at the weekends. It is completely flexible and your earning power is unlimited. 'We can't imagine our lives without Avon.' Avon was established in America more than 120 years ago by a door-to-door bookseller who gave away vials of perfume to female customers. He soon set up a business selling toiletries directly to customers after he realised they liked the samples more than the books. Avon is the world's leading direct seller of beauty and related products, with over £6.75billion in annual revenue. Avon Representatives each run their own independent business, with control over the hours they work and money they make. Avon reaches women in over 100 countries through over six million sales representatives and sells over 3.5 billion products a year to 300 million customers. As part of the brand’s reinvention, which has seen it tap into a younger generation, it has secured partnerships with celebrity ambassadors including Reese Witherspoon, Fergie, Ashley Greene and Yasmin le Bon. One in three women in the UK is an Avon customer. Every second, four Avon lipsticks and two Avon mascaras are sold somewhere in the world.

"A craze for compliments is sweeping Facebook after high school and university students set up pages where users could give friends at the same school a boost anonymously. The sudden outbreak of 'cyber-graciousness' amongst youngsters in the U.S. and Canada has been hailed as a refreshing change from the bullying and trolling the internet has become notorious for. According to reports, four students at Queens University in Ontario, Canada, were the first to set up such a page for their institution several months ago. Reverse trolling: The Queens U Compliments page, set up in September, has sparked a craze across America for Facebook pages where school students can give their peers an anonymous boost . The idea quickly took hold among youngsters elsewhere and there are now nearly 100 such groups on Facebook, most based in Canada and the U.S. The Queens U Compliments Page, set up September 12, invited students to 'inbox a . compliment for a Queen's student and have it published anonymously'. Since then thousands of compliments have been posted on the page, which . already boasts nearly 5,000 friends. The pages work by accepting compliments sent directly to an inbox, which administrators then re-post the person for whom the compliment is intended tagged so it shows up in their Facebook notifications. Very nice: One post as it appears on the Queens U compliments page . The compliments are reposted anonymously by the page's administrators, so their recipients have no idea who their flatterer is. One such compliment recently posted on the Queens U Compliments page reads: 'Sam Farkas is simply wonderful. Down to earth and kind.' Another says: 'Mark B Charette this man is the hardest working individual I know, he deserves some respect for always putting others before him. Never give up and keep being a bouss [sic].' A third gushes: 'Brody Herberman is such a gem. She's always there as a shoulder to cry on and she never fails to make you feel ten times better. Plus she always looks so cool! Love you girl.' Glenn Stutzky, an instructor in the . School of Social Work at Michigan State University, where students set . up a similar page, told the Detroit Free Press they could have 'a . contagious effect in a positive sense'. 'There is so much negativity today, . whether you see it on TV or in movies or even in just personal . relationships. This is like a breath of fresh air,' Mr Stutzky said. 'I like the idea of having something other than cyber-bullying. This is cyber-graciousness.' 'Cyber-graciousness': The Columbia Compliments page for New York's Columbia University. Glenn Stutzky, an instructor at Michigan State University, where students set up a similar page, said it was a 'breath of fresh air' As U.S. students use Facebook to launch spontaneous campaigns of anonymous goodwill, students on the other side of the Atlantic are set to sue the social network claiming it has not done enough to protect the privacy of its members. Privacy campaign group europe-v-facebook, a Europe-wide student group which has been lobbying for better data protection by Facebook for over a year, said it planned to take legal action in Ireland, where Facebook has its international headquarters. The move is one of a number of campaigns against the giants of the internet, which are under pressure from investors to generate more revenue from their huge user bases but which also face criticism for storing and sharing personal information. Internet search engine Google, for example, has been told by the European Union to make changes to its new privacy policy, which pools data collected on individual users across its services including YouTube, gmail and social network Google+, and from which users cannot opt out. Europe-v-facebook has won some concessions from Facebook, notably pushing it to switch off its facial recognition feature in Europe. But the group said last week the changes did not go far enough and it was disappointed with the response of the Irish Data Protection Commissioner, which had carried out an audit after the campaign group filed numerous complaints. Another youngster to take up the idea of setting up a compliments page for his school was Eyal Hanfling, a pupil at Walt Whitman High in Bethesda, Maryland, a state-funded school with 2,000 students. After seeing similar pages complimenting friends across the country coming up in his news feed, he anonymously created the account one evening. Within 24 hours his page had attracted more than 300 compliments. 'I was really worried that people would take advantage of the system and write horrible things about their classmates and peers,' Eyal told NBC News. But, he added, of the roughly 1,500 comments submitted over the four days he ran the page, just four or five were derogatory, with only one using a profanity. Indeed, in what could be soon as a total reverse of the usual online trend to ever more unpleasant insults, the complimenting soon became competitive.

"Norway defender Vegard Forren has branded England striker Wayne Rooney 'a bit chubby' ahead of the friendly on Wednesday night. Rooney was unveiled as the new England captain last week despite an underwhelming performance at this summer's World Cup, which saw the striker score only one goal. Norway are placed 53rd in the FIFA world rankings, 33 spots below England, but Forren insists he will not be afraid of his opponents at Wembley. VIDEO Scroll down to see Rooney's first England press conference as captain . A bit chubby? Norway defender Vegard Forren has accused Wayne Rooney of carrying some extra weight . Opinionated: Norway defender Forren (left) did not hold back when describing Rooney's condition .

'They're obviously good players, and many of them are on good form already after three games in the Premier League but we're looking forward to it.' The match will give Roy Hodgson a final chance to see his players in competitive action before England begin their Euro 2016 qualification campaign in Switzerland on Monday. Norway last reached the finals of a European Championship in 2000 and the Scandinavian side face a difficult task to qualify from a group that includes Italy and Croatia. Forren admits the likes of Rooney, Daniel Sturridge and Raheem Sterling will provide a stern test for him and his team-mates. 'It's almost a bit scary but it's in games like this and experiences like this you want to be able to contribute so I'm looking forward to it,' Forren said.

"JB Holmes held his nerve to complete a long comeback from brain surgery by winning the Wells Fargo Championship in North Carolina. Holmes dropped shots on the 16th and 18th in a tense finish, but his three-foot putt saw him hold off a stern challenge from Jim Furyk, whose round of 65 had powered him into contention. Holmes, whose last title came at the FBR Open in 2008, underwent brain surgery in 2011 after being diagnosed with structural defects in the cerebellum, eventually returning to competition in January 2012. Winner: JB Holmes poses with the trophy after securing victory in the final round of the Wells Fargo Championship . Good start: JB Holmes tee's off at the 17th during the final round of the Wells Fargo Championship . Sealed with a kiss: Holmes is congratulated by his wife, Erica, after his emotional victory at Quail Hollow . It has been a long fight back to the top of the leaderboard and for a moment it looked as if his nerves would betray him. After Furyk had lit up the Quail Hollow course with some stunning play, Holmes made the turn on par before picking up shots on the 10th, 11th and 15th holes. Victory was in his grasp but he bogeyed the 16th and then sent his tee shot into the trees on the 18th. He narrowly missed a bunker with his second shot and then made full use of his remaining leeway on the leaderboard as he two-putted for the win. 'It feels great,' Holmes said on Sky Sports 4. 'First I want to think my Lord and saviour for being with me this week and giving me the strength to do this, I definitely couldn't do it myself. That's first and foremost. 'It's been a long journey for me, there's been some ups and downs but it's a great feeling to be out here and get one done. I'm happy with the way the year is going.' With the victory, Holmes also booked his spot for The Players Championship. On form: JB Holmes chips onto the 18th green at the Quail Hollow Club . Crowd favourite: Holmes celebrates holing the winning putt in front of the packed 18th green . Furyk had been watching the end of Holmes' round from the clubhouse after picking up several places with the best round of the day. He made the turn already three under par and then birdied the 13th and 14th before an eagle on the par five 15th put him in contention. That moved him above Martin Flores who could only manage par to drop back into third, two shots off the lead, with Jason Bohn in fourth and Justin Rose fifth. Rory McIlroy, who recovered from a dismal 76 on Friday with a 65 on Saturday, signed for a 70 that left him in a share of eighth place.

"Warning: Dr Connie Mariano, former head of the White House Medical Unit, said that Christie should lose weight if he wants to run for president . The former White House doctor who Chris Christie told to 'shut up' after she criticized his weight said she also received an angry phone call from the New Jersey Governor. Christie attacked Arizona physician Connie Mariano during a press conference earlier in the week but the woman has revealed he called her and yelled at her over the phone. 'It was essentially the tone of the press conference, only louder,' she told 3TV. 'It was hard to get anything across.' Mariano said Christie's behaviour had made her consider withdrawing her support for the politician, who is a potential presidential candidate for 2016. 'The way he acted lately I don't think so. He wasn't very nice to me,' the doctor said. 'Politically, if this is the way (he handles) stress... is this presidential? I'll have to think about that. Is this a presidential way to behave? C'mon.' Mariano said she had received a barrage of harsh comments from Christie supporters after her remarks. 'I've gotten lots of hate mails, lots of threatening, mean stuff. My intention wasn't to hurt anybody,' she said. The woman, who was the White House doctor for nine years, encompassing both Bush administrations and Clinton's time as president, said she thought Christie may have gotten her mixed up. 'I don't think he realized who he was talking to,' Mariano told 3TV. She said that it was common for medical experts to give their opinions on the health concerns of potential presidential candidates. 'I think I'm qualified to make a comment,' she added. The fierce row was sparked when Christie made a joke about his size on Late Night with David Letterman, at one point whipping out a donut from his pocket to drive the self-deprecation home. Scroll down for video . Hungry man: The doctor's comments came just two days after the Governor poked fun at himself by pulling a donut from his pocket halfway through his interview with David Letterman . The Republican rising star then lashed . out at the former White House doctor after she labelled his stunt 'sad' and said that he should lose weight before considering a run for the . presidency. 'I’m worried about this man dying in office,' Mariano said in an interview with CN. 'I can understand why his doctors and . other people have had trouble getting him to lose weight. This is an . issue that will haunt him if he decides to run for office,' she said. She even said that she would like to see him go for the top job, but that didn't help to soften the blow. But Christie's backlash was harsh, claiming on Wednesday that since . Dr Mariano hasn't given him a physical exam or heard anything about his . family history, 'she should shut up'. 'I . find it fascinating that a doctor in Arizona -- who's never met me, . never examined me, never reviewed my medical history or records and . knows nothing about my family history -- could make a diagnosis from . 2,400 miles away,' he said. Good taste: Letterman has poked fun of Christie's weight in several late-night monologues and the Republican showed that he could take a joke, but he wasn't as light hearted when it came to issues about a possible run . On Letterman's show, a . good portion of their conversation was dedicated to the talk show . host's habit of making fun of the 50-year-old governor's girth. He joked, following a recent . physical that showed his blood sugar and cholesterol levels to be in . acceptable ranges: 'I'm basically the healthiest fat guy you've . ever seen in your life.' That remark was off-putting for Mariano, who responded in a live phone interview on CNN saying: 'I . thought it was very sad that he made fun of that.' 'I'm not a hack. If you look up my . resume, I've been in the White House for nine years. I'm a retired Navy . rear admiral. I'm board-certified in internal medicine.' She ended the interview abruptly as she said that the Governor was calling her at that very moment. He admitted that his size was 'fair . game' for comedians, but he followed their night of laughs up with a . more serious admission the next day. Christie told reporters on Tuesday . that even though he is 'remarkably healthy', his doctor 'continues to . warn me that my luck is going to run out relatively soon.' Tough talk: The New Jersey governor said that since Dr Mariano doesn't know his family history and has never given him a physical 'she should shut up' This is far from a new issue, as the . questions began to arise about whether his weight would hinder a . possible presidential run when he was suggested as a potential Republican . candidate early on in the 2012 race. It came up again when he was thought to be a front-runner for Mitt Romney's running mate. He . directly addressed the issue when he sat down with Barbara Walters in . December after being selected as one of her 'most fascinating people' of . the year. She asked the governor and possible Republican presidential nominee if he agrees with the criticism that he is too fat to run for the position of Commander in Chief. 'That's ridiculous, I mean that's ridiculous- I don't know what the basis for that is,' he said in the interview. One of the concerns often cited by his critics is that the 50-year-old politician's obesity increases the risk of health problems like possible Type 2 diabetes, heart disease and certain types of cancers. 'I've done this job pretty well, and I think people have watched me for the last number of weeks with Hurricane Sandy doing 18 hour days and getting right back up the next day and still being just as effective in the job, so I don't really think that would be a problem,' he said in response.","Arizona physician Connie Mariano said the New Jersey Governor yelled at her over the phone after she suggested he was too fat to run for president .

"Two Libyan soldiers who were being trained in the UK behaved like a 'pack preying on women' as they stalked them in the dark to sexually assault them, a court has heard. Ibrahim Naji El Maarfi, 20, and Mohammed Abdalsalam, 27, rode stolen bicycles from their barracks to Cambridge where they touched the lone women sexually and tried to put their hands up their skirts. Abdalsalam admitted two counts of sexual assault, one count of threatening behaviour towards a police officer and one count of theft. The two Libyan soldiers cycled from the base in Bassingbourn in Cambridgeshire to the city to stalk women . El Maarfi pleaded guilty to two counts of sexual assault, one count of exposure and one count of theft. A third man, Khaled El Azibi, 18, charged with three counts of sexual assault and one count of theft refused to enter pleas at the hearing. The court heard how the soldiers - who all appeared in court wearing tracksuits - are based at Bassingbourn Barracks some 14 miles outside Cambridge. Prosecutor Paul Brown told the court: 'The most serious aspect of it it there are males targeting females under the cover of darkness. 'They are like a pack preying on women in the hours of darkness. 'These women were by themselves at night and they were vulnerable.' Mr Brown said the first victim was walking on her own at 10.30pm when the men approached her before touching her at 'various times'. El Maarfi then exposed his penis to her. Mr. Brown said: 'She was clearly distressed by the incident.' The crimes were caught on CCTV and the 'pack' was seen to ride off. They then met two more women who were together and sexually assaulted them. The soldiers left the barracks on stolen bikes and made their way to Cambridge where they stalked women . Cambridge magistrates said they were unable to sentence the two who pleaded guilty and they will be sentenced at Cambridge Crown Court at a later date. They were both remanded in custody together with El Azibi whose case will be dealt with at the higher court. The court heard that the two soldiers who pleaded guilty have been told they are not allowed to return to their camp and are 'likely' to face deportation. They were remanded in custody because they 'have nowhere to go' and are a 'danger to the public'. Up to 2,000 Libyan troops are due to be trained at Bassingbourn in separate groups over a 15 month period, with the aim of them returning home and helping to achieve Philip Hammond's aim to make the country more stable. More than 300 Libyan soldiers arrived at the barracks in June to start a 24-week course. They are being taught basic infantry and junior command skills in a bid to help bring stability to the war-torn country on their return. They are currently being trained by the 3rd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland. Bassingbourn has been beset by problems after three North African soldiers stationed there were detained after breaking orders not to go tothe local Tesco. The incident escalated when up to 20 of their comrades stormed the area where they were being kept to demand their release.

"The driver who was at the controls of a speeding commuter train which derailed killing four people has been suspended without pay. Engineer William Rockefeller claims he fell into 'a hypnosis-like daze' when his Metro North train ran off the rails along a curve on the outskirts of New York while travelling at 82 mph. Today rail bosses confirmed the 46-year-old had been suspended immediately after the derailment and following a drug test, in line with railroad policy, according to NBCnews. Under scrutiny: Rockefeller initially told investigators that the brakes didn't work but then he later said that he may have 'dozed off' behind the wheel on the Sunday morning shift . Earlier his lawer Jeffrey Chartier . accompanied Mr Rockefeller to his interview with National Transportation . Safety Board investigators and described the account his client had . given. Chartier said the . engineer experienced a nod or ‘a daze,’ almost like road fatigue or the . phenomenon sometimes called highway hypnosis. He couldn't say how long . it lasted. What Rockefeller remembers is . ‘operating the train, coming to a section where the track was still . clear - then, all of a sudden, feeling something was wrong and hitting . the brakes,’ Chartier said. ‘... He felt something was not right, and he . hit the brakes.’ Suspended: Train driver William Rockefeller is wheeled on a stretcher away from the area where the commuter train he was operating derailed in the Bronx borough of New York . Nodded: An attorney who accompanied Rockefeller to his meeting with the National Transportation Safety Board said the engineer has now revealed he nodded off just prior to the crash and awoke when it was too late to brake . He called Rockefeller ‘a guy with a stellar record who, I believe, did nothing wrong.’ ‘You've got a good guy and an accident,’ he said. ‘... A terrible accident is what it is.’ Rockefeller . ‘basically nodded,’ said Anthony Bottalico, leader of the rail . employees union, relating what he said the engineer told him. ‘He . had the equivalent of what we all have when we drive a car,’ Bottalico . said. ‘That is, you sometimes have a momentary nod or whatever that . might be.’ Terror: The Metro-North train entered a 30mph curve at 82mph in New York City, derailing and coming to a halt feet from the Hudson River . Getting answers: Federal investigators have determined that there was nothing technically wrong with the train's brakes before the Sunday morning crash but came short of fully blaming the conductor . Investigators have determined earlier that the . deadly train derailment was not caused by any technical problems with . the train itself as the driver had originally claimed. The . National Transportation Safety Board said in a Tuesday press conference . that it hadn't found any evidence of brake or signal trouble during the . train's nine previous stops along New York's Hudson River on Sunday . morning. NTSB member Earl . Weener said Tuesday there were 'no anomalies' with the train but it was . too soon to formally say whether the excessive speed was the result of . human error- say, a sleepy or distracted operator- or a mechanical . problem. Clean up: Engineers begin the task of recovering the derailed carriages from the banks of the Hudson River . While investigators had yet to finish talking with engineer William Rockefeller, questions swirled around him because the train went into the curve at nearly three times the speed limit. Dozens of people were injured and four people were killed. As . NTSB worked to determine what caused the Sunday morning wreck in the . Bronx, Governor Andrew Cuomo said Rockefeller should be disciplined for . 'unjustifiable' speed. Investigators began talking to the engineer Monday but didn't complete the interview. The . New York Police Department is conducting its own investigation, with . help from the Bronx district attorney's office, in the event the . derailment becomes a criminal case. Whatever the findings on the cause of the crash, Cuomo said Tuesday the engineer could be faulted for the train's speed alone. Recovery: Federal investigators wouldn't comment on Rockefeller's level of alertness around the time of the Sunday morning wreck, which killed 4. Shown are recovery operations in the Bronx on Monday . 'Certainly, we want to make sure that that operator is disciplined in an appropriate way. There's such a gross deviation from the norm,' the Governor said. An attorney for Rockefeller didn't immediately return calls Tuesday, but his union spoke up in his defense. 'This is a man who is totally distraught by the loss of life, and he's having a tough time dealing with that,' said Anthony Bottalico, his union leader. 'Once the NTSB is done with their investigation and Billy is finished with his interview, it will be quite evident that there was no criminal intent with the operation of his train,' Bottalico said. Rockefeller had an unblemished record prior to the accident but told investigators after the crash that he had 'zoned out'. The engineer, who is married with no children, has worked for the railroad for about 20 years and has been an engineer for 11, Bottalico said. Critical: Governor Cuomo, seen at the crash site on Sunday alongside NTSB's Weener, has now said that the engineer will undoubtedly be punished for the 'unjustifiable' speed as he was going 82mph in a 30mph zone . Rockefeller lives in a well-kept house on a modest rural road in Germantown, N.Y., about 40 miles south of Albany. He started as a custodian at Grand Central Terminal, then monitored the building's fire alarms and other systems, and ultimately became an engineer. Rockefeller's work routine had recently changed: he had begun running that route on November 17, two weeks before the wreck, said Marjorie Anders, a spokeswoman for Metro-North's parent, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. A Metro-North passenger train lays on its side after derailing on Sunday in the Bronx borough of New York City leaving four people dead . Bottalico said Rockefeller had changed . work schedules- switching from afternoons to the day shift, which . typically begins at 5am- but was familiar with the route and qualified . to run it. 'He was a stellar . employee. Unbelievable,' said his former supervisor, Michael McLendon, . who retired from the railroad about a year ago. McLendon . said he was stunned when he heard about the crash, shortly after . opening his mail to find a Christmas card from Rockefeller and his wife. 'I said, ""Well, I can't imagine Billy making a mistake,""' McLendon said. 'Not intentionally, by any stretch of the imagination.'","William Rockefeller, 46, told .

"Video footage has emerged of the moment Reese Witherspoon got into a drunken confrontation with a police office which resulted in her arrest for disorderly conduct. The one and a half minute film, taken from the patrol car's dash camera and posted on TMZ, shows Reese slurring and screaming at a police officer in Atlanta, Georgia following her husband Jim Toth's arrest for DUI. Reese was arrested for on April 19 after disobeying an officer's order to stay in the car. After repeated requests from the police officer and her husband to stay quiet, her antagonistic exchange with the police officer ended in her being handcuffed and charged. Furious: The moment captured on the police car's dash camera which shows Reese Witherspoon (bottom right) arrested for disorderly conduct . In the video, an agitated Reese attempts to protest after husband Jim was handcuffed after failing a field sobriety test. The officer told the actress several times to sit down and stay in the car, much to her chagrin. 'I'm pregnant and I need to use the restroom,' she calls to the officer . - something she told GMA on Thursday morning was untrue. Seemingly unable to listen, Reese gets out of the car and begins arguing with the officer who promptly arrests her. Hands behind your back: Reese was enraged at her arrest and accused the officer of harassment . Do you know my name? Reese was incensed when the officer did not appear to care that she is a famous movie star . Officer: 'Get back in that car. I'm not going to repeat myself again. If you get out of the car again, I'm going to arrest you.'Reese: I'm pregnant and I need to use the restroom.'Officer: 'There ain't nowhere to use it out here. If I tell you again, I'm going to arrest you. Reese: 'Do you know my name sir?'Officer: 'Don't need to know.'Reese: 'You don't NEED to know my name?'Officer: 'Not quite yet.""Reese: 'Oh really? Okay. You're about to find out who I am.'Reese: 'You are harassing me as an American citizen. I have done nothing against the law.'Officer: 'Yes you did, you didn't obey my orders.'Reese: 'I have to OBEY your orders?'Reese: 'I'm now being arrested and handcuffed?'Reese: 'I'm a U.S. citizen ... I'm allowed to stand on American ground and ask any question I want to ask. You better not arrest me.'Reese: 'I'm being anti-American?'Officer: 'Yes, please sit down.'Reese: 'Wow! Interesting. Reese: 'You're harassing me as an American citizen' Officer: 'I tried.'Jim Toth: 'I'm sorry. I had absolutely nothing to do with that.' 'Do you know my name sir?' she asks the policeman, who responds with a curt, 'Don't need to know.' 'You don't NEED to know my name?' an incredulous Reese asks. 'You're about to find out who I am.' Clearly furious at being handcuffed, the actress begins to indignantly accuse the officer of harassment. 'I'm a U.S. citizen... I'm allowed to stand on American ground and ask any question I want to ask,' she screams. 'You're harassing me as an American citizen. You better not arrest me.' Even more damming for the Oscar winning actress was her husband's rather embarrassed reaction to her outburst after Reese is handcuffed. 'I'm sorry. I had absolutely nothing to do with that,' Toth told the officer. Meanwhile, Reese pleaded 'no contest' to charges stemming from her disorderly conduct arrest two weeks ago. The actress was not in the Atlanta court to hear her lawyer Bruce Morris enter the plea on Thursday. She was ordered to pay a $213 fine on the charge of 'physical obstruction of another,' according to TMZ who released an explosive video of the star's arrest. However, Toth was in court to enter a guilty plea for driving under the influence. The judge told him: 'Consider yourself fortunate you didn't injure your passenger [Reese] and didn't kill anyone' Toth, . a talent agent for CAA, received no jail time, but must perform 40 . hours of community service and attend an alcohol education programme. He has also been placed on probation for 12 months. Mug shot: Reese and Jim Toth pictured shortly after their arrests on April 19 . Likes to party: Reese's husband, CAA agent Jim Toth, is said to get loud when he drinks . Just hours earlier, Reese appeared on Good Morning America in her first interview since her arrest. Speaking publicly for the first time . about the incident, she said: 'It was just one of those nights - we went . out to dinner and had one too many glasses of wine. 'We thought we were . OK to drive but we definitely were not. We are just so sorry this . happened. We know better than that. It's something that will absolutely never happen again. 'I . had no idea what I was thinking that night. I saw him arrest my husband . and I just panicked. I said all kinds of crazy things to the officer. I . even told him I was pregnant. I am not pregnant!' Subdued: Reese looked rather less animated back on the set of her film The Good Lie on Thursday in Atlanta, compared to her performance in the dashcam video . When asked . what she said to her children about the incident, the actress told ABC: . 'The worst part was having to speak to the kids. 'We . are so embarrassed by it but we just had to tell them that when you . make a mistake, you have to take responsibility. We were honest with . them.' She has two children aged 13 and nine with her first husband Ryan Phillippe and an eight-month-old baby with Toth. Reese said: 'It was just one of those nights - we went out to dinner and had one too many glasses of wine. We thought we were OK to drive but we definitely were not' Exit: Reese smiled from behind sunglasses as she left ABC's studios after her appearance on GMA . The officer on the scene claims that the actress became clearly agitated and eventually disobeyed his verbal commands. He . reported: ‘Mrs Witherspoon began to hang out the window and say that . she did not believe that I was a real police officer. I told Mrs . Witherspoon to sit on her butt and be quiet.’ When asked by George Stephanopoulos if she learned any lessons from the incident, she joked and said: 'When a police officer tells you to stay . in the car, you stay in the car.

"Hurricane Gonzalo crushed trees, flattened power lines and damaged Bermuda's main hospital - in what was one of the strongest storms ever to hit the tiny Atlantic island chain. The storm tore through the nation at 110mph on Friday night and heavy surf and relentless winds were still whipping at the island early Saturday as it moved northward over the Atlantic. Forecasters warned that a storm surge of up to 10 feet could cause widespread flooding, but a full assessment of the damage caused was not expected until Saturday morning local time. Scroll down for video . Only the beginning: Strong winds are already battering the coast of Bermuda, tearing through palm trees and whipping up waves as a wall of water up to 40ft high builds in open ocean . Threat: A satellite image taken early this morning shows Hurricane Gonzalo just north of Bermuda, the tiny yellow dot south of the storm . Incredible: European Space Agency astronaut Alexander Gerst shared this astonishing image showing the storm's massive scale . By mid-afternoon on Friday, streets were empty as the high winds reaching tropical storm force of 40 mph bent back palm trees on Harrington Sound in the middle of the islands, prompting the government to close a major causeway bridge linking the main island to the east end. The leader of the tiny territory in the Atlantic urged those in low-lying areas to consider moving to higher ground. 'We should expect at least 24 hours of storm-force winds,' Premier Michael Dunkley said. Bermuda closed its schools and international airport, as well as suspending all public transportation, including ferries. Authorities on Thursday evacuated two hotels along Bermuda's southern coast, with guests either flying out or being placed in another hotel. Just under half of the island's 70,000 residents were reported without power late yesterday as the hurricane roared through - just days after Tropical Storm Fay damaged homes and knocked down trees and power lines. A British Royal Navy warship, HMS Argyll, was heading for Bermuda to help with post-Gonzalo relief efforts, the government said. 'To be struck twice by two different cyclones is unusual, to say the least,' said Max Mayfield, a former director of the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami.

At the ready: Pedestrians walk past a shop boarded up with storm shutters as they prepare for the arrival of Gonzalo in Hamilton . Gonzalo approached Bermuda as a Category 3 storm before weakening to a Category 2 strength just before making landfall with sustained wind speeds of 110 mph. The Bermuda Weather Service said hurricane-force winds would whip at the island into the early hours of Saturday, and tropical storm-force winds would continue until around sunrise. Part of the roof at Bermuda's main hospital was damaged and there was water damage in the new intensive care unit, police spokesman Dwayne Caines reported. Flooding caused by surging waves was expected to pose the biggest problem, with sea-levels rising to between 30 and 40 feet. Dave Fox, a public affairs officer for the Bermuda government, said the government opened a high school as a shelter but noted that Bermuda is known for structures that can withstand heavy storms. 'We build for hurricanes,' he said. 'It's part of the building code.' The last major hurricane to strike Bermuda was Fabian in September 2003. The Category 3 storm killed three police officers and another person while causing more than $100million in damage as it tore off roofs, pulverized trees and flooded famed golf courses.

On its way: This NOAA image taken at 11pm Thursday shows Hurricane Gonzalo, right, as it approaches Bermuda . It also damaged the causeway linking the airport to most of Bermuda and left tens of thousands of homes and businesses without power. Forecasters had anticipated that Gonzalo would follow Fabian's general path and cause similar damage to Bermuda, which lies about 850 miles off the east coast of the US. Marlie Powell, the owner of Kingston House Bed & Breakfast, said in a phone interview that she was still recovering from Tropical Storm Fay when Gonzalo hit. She said Fay toppled two large trees on her property. She said: 'We only had very few days to clean and get the trees out of our house. There's a lot of loose debris around the island already, which is not good.' A 436-foot frigate from Britain's Royal Navy with a crew of some 180 sailors was expected to arrive Sunday in Bermuda to help with post-storm recovery efforts. The U.S. National Hurricane Center said the storm weakened some more as it moved away from Bermuda on a track that would take it past Newfoundland and across the Atlantic to Britain and Ireland. A tropical storm watch was issued for parts of southeastern Newfoundland. Gonzalo has already wrought destruction in the Caribbean, killing an elderly sailor and damaging some three dozen vessels in St. Maarten, the Dutch portion of Saint Martin island, the Daily Herald reported. Large ocean swells continued to affect parts of the Virgin Islands, the northern coasts of Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, parts of the Bahamas and the U.S. southeast coast.

"Weber Middle School in Port Washington, Long Island has banned ball playing during recess. According to school officials, the school district is undergoing a construction project that restricts the space in which children can play. ‘There is limited space for the students to enjoy a 20-minute recess period,’ said a statement from the school district. ‘It is not safe for them to be engaged in unstructured play with hard balls,’ it continued. Port Washington Schools Superintendent Kathleen Maloney strongly . believes in the school’s decision to ban footballs, baseballs, lacrosse balls . and any other hard balls that could potentially injure a child. Games of tag and cartwheels are also off limits unless there is an adult present to supervise. Weber Middle School (pictured) in Port Washington, Long Island has banned ball playing during recess . Hard balls like basketball, baseballs, footballs, and soccer balls are banned from recess due to limited space . According to a statement by the school, ‘Absent the confined . space within which recess must temporarily be held, such restrictions would not . be necessary.’ ‘Some of these injuries can unintentionally become very . serious, so we want to make sure our children have fun, but are also protected,’ Maloney told CBS. Students were disappointed upon hearing the news. ‘That’s all we want to do. We’re in school all day sitting behind the desk learning,’ one student told CBS. Parents were also surprised and angered by the school’s restrictions during recess. Students are not permitted to do cartwheels or play tag during recess without adult supervision . ‘This isn't smart. It's actually counter-productive,' said parent Donna Daniels in an e-mail to CNN. ‘It saddens me to think that children no longer experience the joy of kickball, tag, dodgeball and simple outdoor games I remember so fondly when I reflect on my childhood. Our kids don't experience physical activity unless it involves downloading an app.’ Some parents believe that decision is a way for the school to avoid possible lawsuits in the case of an injury during recess. The children are only permitted to use soft Nerf balls, except when they participate in gym class or intramural sports. ‘Children’s safety is paramount, but at the same time, you have to let them live life,’ said parent Ellen Cohen. ‘There are rational precautions (helmets for bikers) and then there is ridiculous. This is over the top,’ said parent Erika Hathaway Stockton on CNN’s Facebook page. It’s rumored that the recess restrictions may spread to nearby school districts. School officials insist that enforcing strict rules minimizes student injuries for everyone's well-being.","Parents believe the school may have restricted play during recess to prevent a lawsuit .

"China and South Korea yesterday condemned the Japanese prime minister for visiting a shrine that honours war dead including convicted war criminals. Beijing called the visit ‘absolutely unacceptable’ while government officials in the South Korean capital, Seoul, told of their ‘regret and anger’. Japan’s neighbours see the Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo as a symbol of Japanese militarism. China said the visit by Shinzo Abe (centre) was 'absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese people' Yesterday US officials said they were ‘disappointed’ by the visit and warned it would ‘exacerbate tensions’ in the region. Currently . Japan, China and South Korea are at loggerheads over the ownership of . certain islands in the East China Sea. Some analysts fear the unstable . totalitarian regime in North Korea could also be dragged in to the row. Prime minister Shinzo Abe said his Boxing Day visit, which was televised live, was an anti-war gesture. But . China and South Korea see the shrine as a symbol of Tokyo’s aggression . during the Second World War, when Japan occupied large areas of China . and the Korean peninsula. Japan entered an unwritten agreement with China in the 1970s which suggested that serving leaders would not visit the shrine. Mr Abe's visit to Yasukuni was the first by a serving prime minister since Junichiro Koizumi went there in 2006 . Mr . Abe’s visit to Yasukuni was the first by a serving Japanese prime . minister since Junichiro Koizumi in 2006. Wearing a morning suit and . grey tie, Mr Abe spent 15 minutes at the shrine to show what he said was . his opposition to war. Television . cameras recording the visit were not allowed into the inner shrine, . where he paid his respects to the war dead. Immediately afterwards Mr . Abe said he ‘prayed to pay respect for the war dead who sacrificed their . precious lives and hoped that they rest in peace’. ‘I . chose this day to report (to the souls of the dead) what we have done . in the year since the administration launched and to pledge and . determine that never again will people suffer in war,’ he said. Hoping . to dampen the growing protests about the visit, Mr Abe added: ‘It is . not my intention at all to hurt the feelings of the Chinese and Korean . people.’ The prime minister’s aides said his visit was in a private capacity. Despite . Mr Abe’s attempts to keep the peace with his neighbours,  Chinese . foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang said: ‘We strongly protest and . seriously condemn the Japanese leader’s acts.’ The Yasukuni shrine was built in 1869 under Emperor Meiji in memory of the country’s war dead. The . shrine contains the remains of some of those commemorated, but is . mostly a symbolic destination for relatives.

"Marines at Camp Leatherneck in south-western Afghanistan will lose one of their four hot meals starting this Saturday, according to Marine Corps officials. The camp will lose the midnight ration service, known as 'midrats', the one meal of the day where all the troops gather together to eat. The meal serves as breakfast for the Marines at the beginning of their midnight-to-midday shift, and dinner for those coming off their midday-to-midnight shift. The idea of forgoing their hot meal rankles with some, including one Marine who declined to be named, whose email to his wife was shared with NBC News. Not quite home-cooked: An MRE (Meal, Ready to Eat), which are now replacing some hot meals at bases in Afghanistan . 'This boils my skin,' he wrote. 'One of my entire shifts will go 6.5 hours without a meal. If we need to cut back on money I could come up with 100 other places.' 'Instead, we will target the biggest contributor to morale. I must be losing my mind. What is our senior leadership thinking? I just got back from flying my ass off and in a few days, I will not have a meal to replenish me after being away for over nine hours.' Registered dietitian and Captain Christina Deehl told CNN that U.S. troops will never go hungry, and that the moves are logistical, not budget-related. 'We would never deprive the soldier of adequate nutrition and that's just all there is to it,' she said. Instead of hot cooked meals, soldiers have access to MREs (Meal, Ready to Eat). These pre-packaged meals contain all the energy and nutrients a soldier needs to meet one-third of their Recommended Daily Allowance. To go: A marine eats a Meals, Ready to Eat (MRE) breakfast, which contains one-third of the Recommended Daily Intake of calories and nutrients for an adult in the military . 'When we initially entered Iraq and Afghanistan, soldiers were eating MREs every day until we were logistically established. Once again when we draw down and pull out, we will see a similar trend,' Deehl explained. 'The fact is our force in Afghanistan is shrinking fast and all the creature comforts and services deployed military-members have grown accustomed to over the past decade are going to be reduced,' Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel Cliff Gilmore to NBC News. 'When serving we are challenged to endure different things - to face different challenges - over time. But we're an odd bunch, we Marines - probably no surprise that we'll complain more about losing the sandwich bar on the way out than we did about getting shot at on the way in.' Camp Leatherneck is one of a reported 17 bases facing cuts to their hot meals, and families back home are worried about how the lack of hot food will affect morale. According to the U.S Army, a MRE provides one-third of the Military Recommended Daily Allowance of vitamins and minerals. A typical MRE looks like this: . 'Psychologically, midrats is probably the most important of all the meals because that’s the big social time - where first (shift) crew is coming off and second (shift) crew is coming on,' Babette Maxwell, founder and executive director of Military Spouse Magazine, the wife of a Navy pilot and an advocate for service members and their families told NBC News. 'That's where you get the esprit de corps, the camaraderie. It's not just the food you're taking away, it's their social sustenance.' The base, which is located in Afghanistan’s south-western Helmand Province, flanked by Iran and Pakistan, will also be losing its 24-hour sandwich bar. Concerned military advocates and family members recently launched a Facebook page called Breakfast for Bagram . to gather food donations that can be sent to troops in Afghanistan. The . page states: 'We are here to help collect and send non-perishable . breakfast type foods to the deployed troops on the 17 bases in . Afghanistan that are not currently serving breakfast 'hot chow' and midnight chow due to the budget cuts.' The loss of cooked meals isn't popular, but it's a reflection of the huge draw-down of U.S. troops from the country, where they've been established for more than 10 years. The U.S. Army's 'support services', such as the people who prepare food, 'need to go home before the people who provide the security which enables those services,' Gilmore told NBC News. 'This is a natural outcome of the draw-down process unrelated to sequestration or the ongoing budget issues back in the States.' More than 30,000 U.S. service members will return from Afghanistan over the coming months until the U.S. hands responsibility back to Afghan forces in 2014.","Soldiers at Camp Leatherneck have lost the midnight rations, or 'midrats', where troops beginning a shift and others ending theirs come together for a hot meal .
Soldier's families say it's bad for morale and camaraderie among troops and others suggest the U.S. is rationing due to financial problems at home .
Officials say the cut-backs have nothing to do with budget cuts, but are part of the gradual withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan .
Marines will have four prepared meals a day until Saturday, when it will be cut to three, and eventually two ."
"Mention the Proms to most music lovers, and they will call to mind the orchestral strains of Elgar and Beethoven. But it seems the BBC has now decided to stretch the definition of classical music… to include the Pet Shop Boys and the Match of the Day theme tune. The corporation has come under fire for further ‘dumbing down’ the annual festival by booking a string of pop acts in a bid to attract younger audiences. The BBC has come under fire for further 'dumbing down' the Proms by booking a string of pop acts . Last year’s schedule was criticised for including two rappers and a punk band, and it seems this year the programme has strayed even further from its traditional remit. It will include concerts by 32-year-old pop singer Paloma Faith – whose music is normally played on Radio 1 – and American rock star Rufus Wainwright. One of the highlights of the summer schedule will be electronic pop duo Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe who form the Pet Shop Boys. The pair – who have won three Brit Awards - are best known for 80s dance hits. But their latest outing will see them perform a new work based on the life of codebreaker Alan Turing alongside the BBC Concert Orchestra and the BBC Singers. Other Proms will include one based entirely on sport. Hosted by presenter Gabby Logan, 41, it will feature well known tunes such as the themes from Match of the Day and Ski Sunday. And there will two concerts aimed at pre-school children with CBeebies characters set to introduce snippets of classical music designed to appeal to the under-fives. This year's festival will include concerts by 32-year-old pop singer Paloma Faith and 80s duo the Pet Shop Boys . Last night, veteran art critic Brian Sewell, 82, accused the BBC of taking the Proms further downmarket. He said: ‘This is tragic. I can’t think of any other word for it. Classical music may need to draw in the younger generations, but I’m not sure having the Pet Shop Boys is going to do the trick. ‘You will end up with very successful pet Shop Boys concert, but it doesn’t mean the audience is going to come back to listen to Beethoven or Wagner. ‘Dumbing-down just doesn’t work, and I should have thought the bloody minded BBC would have worked that out by now. They always have to back-track because they begin to lose their core audience.’ ‘The most successful prom I ever witnessed was a night devoted entirely to Stephen Sondheim. It was pure, unadulterated punishment for me. 'I do not suppose for one moment that the . people sitting there will ever go again to a Prom concert. They went . because it was Sondheim and will not be seduced into watching Beethoven. Two concerts will feature CBeebies characters designed to appeal to listeners under the age of five . Mr . Sewell added: ‘I would rather a Proms that was true to itself but which . sold fewer tickets. The size of the concert is unimportant. ‘The actual experience of going to the Albert Hall for a concert is deeply unpleasant. It is hot, the acoustics are not nearly as good as they ought to be, and if you want a glass of water or a sticky bun it costs you a small fortune. It is not a great experience in itself. ‘So there is no point getting more people through the door unless they are genuinely interested in classical music.’ Other star performers at this year’s . Proms – which run from July 18 to September 13 – are the puppets from . West End theatre hit War Horse, which will star alongside a Military . Wives choir assembled by Gareth Malone. The season will feature orchestras from dozens of countries, including Chine, Singapore, Iceland and South Korea. Several prominent British conductors will mark their birthdays with performances, including Sir Neville Marriner, who turned 90 last week, conducting his first prom since 1997. It is not the first time the Proms have been accused of dumbing down in a bid to be inclusive. Last year’s schedule featured rappers Fazer and Maverick Fazer, punk veterans The Stranglers. Other years have featured a Comedy Prom and a Doctor Who Prom, while the 2007 festival was criticised for having a show-tunes evening with Michael Ball. Proms director, and Radio 3 Controller, Roger Wright – who is stepping down this summer - defended the schedule yesterday. He said: ‘We should put it in context. They are just a few out of 90-plus events. This is about introducing new people to the Proms and the notion this is something brand new is totally wrong. ‘We want people to feel connected to the Proms. It is about making sure they are there, they have a good time, they know howto get in, where to queue, how to pay. ‘All of those things are a key part of opening it up. We have anecdotal evidence that they come again. They start to put their feet very gently in other more popular elements of the programme. ‘You can’t just sit there in the Albert Hall or Radio 3 and simply expect audiences who have no experience of this music to find you.’","Last year corporation blasted for rap and punk performances .

"Roberto Martinez wants Everton’s players to wreck Steven Gerrard’s Merseyside derby farewell and banish their own wretched record in this famous fixture. Everton have beaten Liverpool only four times since the turn of the millennium. Their last win was in October 2010, a run in all competitions that stretches nine matches, so recent form makes Brendan Rodgers’ side favourites to ensure Gerrard’s 33rd derby appearance is a successful one. Rodgers wryly observed that Evertonians would probably be glad to see the back of Gerrard, who will join LA Galaxy in the summer, but Martinez feels Everton’s players are ready to inject some momentum into their campaign. Steven Gerrard leads the way as Liverpool train at Melwood on Thursday morning . Gerrard will likely play in his last Merseyside derby  at Goodison Park on Saturday evening . Premier League: Games - 29, Won - 16, Drawn - 9, Lost - 4, Win % - 55.1, Goals - 9, Assists - 4, Bookings - 3, Red cards - 2 . Cup: Games - 3, Won - 1, Drawn - 1, Lost - 1, Win % - 33.3%, Goals - 1, Assists - 0, Bookings - 0, Red cards - 0 . Victory at Crystal Palace last Saturday was Everton’s first since December 15 and Martinez hopes that will prove to be a turning point. The Everton manager is aware of the emotion surrounding Gerrard but hopes he leaves Goodison Park with a defeat. ‘There is going to be a lot of talk about Gerrard but the only thing that matters to us is to try to use this as a springboard for our season,’ said the Spaniard. ‘We picked up a very important win last weekend. The derby comes at the perfect moment for us. It can kick-start our season after the good moment we are sharing. ‘If you want to grow as a team you need a strong rival and a strong rivalry. We had that last season. I’m not too concerned about the record for the last 20 years. I’m more concerned about what the record is going to be in the next 20 years.’ Roberto Martinez will be hoping to ruin what could potentially be Gerrard's final Merseyside derby . Gerrard will be playing in his last Merseyside derby unless they meet in the Europa League . The build-up to this game is not entirely settled for Martinez, who is ready to take a chance on the hamstrung James McCarthy. Kevin Mirallas has cast doubt on his future at Goodison and suggested he may leave in the summer. Tottenham were keen on signing Mirallas in January but never made a bid. The Belgium international has never said he wants to leave but, with 18 months left on his contract, he feels he is approaching the stage where he has to review his situation. ‘I like it over here but I feel ready for a new challenge,’ said Mirallas. ‘I dream of playing in the Champions League next season, with Everton or with another club. I just have to see after the season. ‘Don’t forget, the 2015 Europa League winners will qualify for the following season’s Champions League. I like the Premier League but Spain tempts me. Atletico Madrid have enquired, but there was no offer.’ James McCarthy could be risked by Martinez as he recovers from a hamstring injury . Kevin Mirallas has cast doubt on his future at Goodison and suggested he may leave in the summer . For Liverpool, the build-up to this fixture has been relatively smooth and confidence is high following the dramatic FA Cup win at Bolton. Rodgers’s main decision is whether to start Daniel Sturridge or use the England striker from the bench. ‘He is not far away from starting, he is really champing at the bit,’ said Rodgers. ‘But we want to make sure he is going to be available now for the rest of the season. If the timing is not quite right it can hurt us. ‘His appetite to play is there, which is great. I need to speak with my staff and Daniel and make a decision. It is difficult because these are games that we want to win, so it is hard if someone only needs 30 or 45 minutes.’","Steven Gerrard could be set for final Merseyside derby on Saturday .

"Demi Moore collapsed after taking nitrous oxide, also known as laughing gas, while at her LA home, it has been claimed. The 49-year-old allegedly inhaled the chemical out of a canister commonly used in whipping cream cans. She allegedly collapsed after having a bad reaction, according to TMZ. A source told the website the actress started to show symptoms of a seizure after ingesting large amounts of the substance. However estranged husband Ashton Kutcher failed to respond when asked if Demi was okay, after he was caught on camera by US site TMZ as he was leaving a nightclub in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Dangerous high? Demi Moore was rushed to hospital on Monday night after reportedly inhaling Nitrous Oxide out of . a canister used in whipping cream cans . 'Whip-it' is the street name for nitrous . oxide contained in a small metal canister and usually used for . recharging whipping cream cans in restaurants. According to TMZ, a female friend who was with the actress while she was inhaling gas told hospital staff she became distressed when Demi had a reaction and was rendered semi-unconscious. The 'whip-it' charger is sold separately and users inhale it from the canister to receive a 'quick high'. It is typically used by young teenagers and is popular because it can easily be bought over the counter from the supermarket. Prescription medication is also said to have played a part in her hospitalization and that her consistent use was one of the causes of her marriage collapse. 'It was a sticking point for Ashton,' a source told People magazine. 'He wanted her to take care of herself and get a hold of things, and she wouldn't. Quick high: 'Whip-it' is the street name for Nitrous . Oxide contained in a small metal canister similar to this one, and usually used for . recharging whipping cream cans in restaurants . 'Her family and friends have been really worried.' Insiders have also told the publication that Demi was troubled and not looking after herself long before Monday night's hospital dash. They say the problems began as she endured her break-up with Kutcher. 'Really, it was over the last year her friends saw a change,' a source told the magazine. 'She wasn't sleeping as well, didn't seem to be eating and looked really gaunt.' Demi was rushed to hospital on Monday night. The actress, who has appeared increasingly frail in recent weeks, was taken to hospital by ambulance following a call to 911 just before 11pm. Shortly after being admitted to hospital, website Radar claimed she was being treated for anorexia, among other substance abuse issues.

A source told Radar: 'She collapsed after having an epileptic seizure... she has not taken care of her health at all lately and has lost a ton of weight.' 'Demi is in getting treated for anorexia, as well as other issues that caused her seizure,' the source added. In the weeks before her hospitalisation, Demi was spotted letting loose on a wild night out with her daughter Rumer, 23. On the night of January 11 she joined her eldest child at Hollywood hot spot Beacher's Madhouse where sources tell Us Weekly magazine she was 'table . dancing while three guys sat there watching.' At least one onlooker claims she appeared intoxicated, although others only saw her drinking Red Bull. Representatives for the star refused to directly comment on the substance abuse allegations.

Earlier this month Demi was seen in a parking lot with a 26-year-old actor and personal trainer Blake Corl-Baietti. Her representatives refused to comment on speculation that the actress was in a relationship with the younger man. Demi recently opened up about her fears and heartache in an interview with US Harper's Bazaar. Changing shape: Demi was looking frail in October in the wake of news . her husband had cheated on her, seen looking healthier in 2009 . She admitted: ‘What scares me is that I’m going to ultimately find out at the end of my life that I’m really not lovable, that I’m not worthy of being loved. 'That there’s something fundamentally wrong with me.’ As well as speaking out about her anxieties, she also opened up about her body image. The actress - who went through a gruelling fitness regime for her role in GI Jane - admitted to having had a ‘love-hate relationship’ with her body but said she had a more positive view of it now. She said: ‘I sit today in a place of greater acceptance of my body and that includes not just my weight but all of the things that come with your changing body as you age to now experiencing my body as extremely thin.’ Demi added: ‘Thin in a way that I never imagined somebody would be saying to me, “You’re too thin, and you don’t look good"".'","Receiving treatment for issues relating to 'substance abuse' and 'anorexia', according to US reports .

"It is an astonishing image that shows the beauty and majesty of the Himalaya region. A climber and filmmaker has created the stunning mosaic of images to show the effect of climate change on the the area surrounding Mount Everest. The 477 individual images that make up the gigapixel image of the Khumbu glacier were captured by David Breashears during the spring of 2012, from the Pumori viewpoint near Mount Everest. Use your mouse to navigate around the image below, and click on the hand under the green boxes to jump to key areas (please note, this requires Flash so will not work on iPads or iPhones) Mingmar, one of the team who captured the 477 images that make up the panorama - and they say they have thousands more ready for a larger version . To see more glacier images, visit GlacierWorks web site. 'The Khumbu Icefall is clearly visible here, and one can easily see the hustle and bustle of Everest Base Camp below', he told MailOnline. The incredible image is made up of 477 images taken with a 300-millimeter lens. Breashears and his team stitched them together to create one massive image that users can zoom in and out of. 'It's just extraordinary and we're so excited by that image, and people love clicking on things and zooming in,' he said. 'We want to tell the bigger story of climate change in the area, and we are working with Microsoft and the Royal Geographical Society on this.' The team eventually hope to develop a far larger version of the image so detailed users can actually zoom inside tents at base camp . 'Just 1/100th of our imagery is on the site, and the storytelling possibilities are incredible - people love to move things,' said Breashears, who has climbed Everest five times. 'It started out as a simple concept, and every time we visit we find out . more - this is not even the tip of the iceberg, we want to take people . all over the mountain with 120,000 pictures from a helicopter in the . region. 'We are building this with Microsoft, and we could soon be able to combine the old and new pictures so people can virtually 'swipe' images to see how they looked in the past.' Scroll down for video . The interactive image above is made up of 477 different photographs electronically stitched together . Mount Everest is the Earth's highest mountain, with a peak at 8,848 metres above sea level. In 1865, Everest was given its official English name by the Royal Geographical Society upon a recommendation by Andrew Waugh, the British Surveyor General of India. Waugh named the mountain after his predecessor in the post, Sir George Everest. It has become a mecca for climbers, and has two main climbing routes, the southeast ridge from Nepal and the north ridge from Tibet. The southeast ridge is technically easier and was the route used by Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953 when they reached the summit for the first time. The team has also been working with the Royal Geographical Society in London to create a series of 'before and after' photographs showing the effect of climate change since 1921. 'It's a very interesting time to be looking at the mountain,' said Breashears. 'After a while I became interested in climate change, and how it was affecting the area. 'Out . of that came the idea for matching photography with Royal Geographical . Society to show the first images from Everest with current ones.' The team now plans to combine the two projects into a vast interactive image of the area so detailed viewers can actually zoom into camps of climbers and see inside tents. 'We are hoping to launch the next version in June next year, and this is really just a placeholder for what we want to do. 'You'll be able to zoom into tents, and swipe pictures to see how the view has changed over time.' Breashears has spent most of his career working in mountain areas. 'When I was 23 I wanted to be a mountaineer after seeing the picture from the top of Everest taken by Sir Edmund Hillary. 'I First went to Himalaya in 1979 to climb Ama Dablam near to Everest, which is over 22,000 feet high. 'I was also becoming interested in photography, so for the past 33 years have been on 5 Everest ascents, including the first live broadcast, and first IMAX film from Everest.

"Never-before-seen colour footage has emerged of JFK riding in his presidential motorcade moments before he is assassinated. The short clip, which was believed lost until earlier this year, shows the President looking relaxed and giving athumbs up as he is driven past cheering crowds lined up along Main Street in Dallas. The footage was shot shortly before the . motorcade headed west towards Dealey Plaza, where Kennedy was . assassinated. It was taken by office worker Andre Leche, who was living in Dallas at the time. He had just bought a new movie camera and thought the President's visit would be a perfect opportunity to use it. Scroll down for video . Thumbs up: JFK gives a thumbs up to cheering crowds as he rides down Main street in Dallas just a few minutes before he was shot dead . Mr Leche died in 1987 and the film canister was thought lost. But this year his son Paul was placing something in his safety deposit box and discovered a yellow Kodak box with 'Kennedy' written on it. He said: 'My family lived in Dallas in November of 1963. On the 22nd my father, Andre Leche, decided we should use his new movie camera to film President Kennedy. 'This footage was shot as the President’s motorcade proceeded on Main Street through very enthusiastic crowds. The route would take him west to Dealey Plaza, where he was assassinated. 'This short clip was shot just before 12:30 p.m. from the north side of Main Street, a few blocks and probably about a minute from the turn into Dealey Plaza. This was five blocks from my father’s office. 'After the President’s car and that minute passed there was no sound of shots but after a few minutes you could hear sirens in the background. Relaxed: President Kennedy chats toTexas Governor John Connelly, as the presidential car makes its way along Main Street . The rare footage was taken by local office worker Andre Leche. It was believed lost until  his son Paul discovered it earlier this year in a safety deposit box . Crowds lined Main Street in Dallas to greet the President on that fateful day . 'The first news of the shooting was on a small – and for the time – novel Japanese radio on radio station KRLD in my father’s office. A while later the local radio news reported the President’s death, some time before the national media. 'After my father’s death in 1987 the original film canister was lost until this year. After looking in vain in my house, I was putting something valuable in my safety deposit box and came across a yellow Kodak box with “Kennedy"" written on it.' This month will see the 50th anniversary of the JFK assassination. Last week the widow of Lee Harvey Oswald, the former marine who is believed to have pulled the trigger, was pictured for the first time in 25 years after reportedly turning down £3m to discuss the shooting. Marina Oswald Porter, is said to be struggling through a life blighted by illness, made worse by the impending 50th anniversary and the inevitable media frenzy which will ensue. Jackie Kennedy smiles as her husband chats to the Texas Governor . Another clip shows mourners laying flowers in tribute to the president two days after the assassination . Friends say the 72-year-old grandmother and mother-of-three, whose greying brown hair was swept back in a ponytail, has lived as a virtual recluse since after her last television interview a quarter of a century ago. In it, she vehemently insisted there was no firm evidence against her former Marine husband - a belief she still has today. Gripped by fear and facing accusations from those who believe she was a co-conspirator in a KGB plot, the grandmother has lived in Rockwall, Texas, since the mid-Seventies with her second husband and three children.","Film clip was taken by office worker Andre Leche on his new movie camera .

"This disturbing image appears to show two headless bodies dumped on the streets of Mexico City. In the photograph, two bodies - both wrapped in plastic and bound with tape - can be seen lying on the side of a road in Nezahualcoyotl, Mexico City. Both of the unidentified corpses appear to be headless in the image. According to local media, the crime scene was first cordoned off on Sunday morning - shortly after the bodies were discovered. Two bodies were dumped wrapped in plastic and bound in tape were discovered on the streets of Nezahualcoyotl, Mexico city on Sunday. Neither have been identified . They were found in the Nezahualcoyotl neighborhood  - an area on the outskirts of Mexico City that is known for its high crime rate and gang culture. The two appear to be further victims of drugs cartels - which are common in the area. Mexico City and its surrounding states have long be gripped by violence on the streets - with much of it linked to members of drugs cartels who battle over their 'patches'. Many towns in the area now have groups of vigilantes who attempt to enforce the law on such groups. Only last week, Mexican authorities confirmed four human heads were found in a town in Michoacan - a state west of Mexico City. The western state is home to hundreds of vigilantes  - many of which sprang up a year ago to drive out members of drugs cartel the Knights Templar. A federal official said police investigators also found a threatening note along with the human remains - but wouldn't reveal its content. Last week four human heads were found in Zacan, Michoacan. The state is home to hundreds of vigilantes - many of whom are attempting to drive out members of drugs cartels . He confirmed the bodies belonged to four men aged between 22 and 55. Vigilantes began rising up against the Knights Templar in February 2013. Last month, the Mexican government effectively legalized the movement after an agreement was reached with group leaders to incorporate the armed civilian groups into quasi-military groups. Last September, six severed human heads were found over two days in the town of Los Reyes - also in Michoacan. The heads all belonged to males and had bullet wounds, reports at the time suggested. Local people in the area have set up a self-defence force to protect against the influence of the drug gangs. However, some residents of the area have reacted in protest at the presence of the groups. Last Thursday, at least three trailer trucks were set alight when 600 arrived in Paracuaro, Michoacan. At the time, residents said they oppose the vigilantes because they are forcing young men to join them. At the end of last year, officers began excavating 28 graves in the town of La Barca, Jalisco - after 62 bodies were discovered in a mass grave.","WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT: Two bodies dumped on streets of Nezahualcoyotl, a suburb of Mexico City .

"Plans to impose a compulsory ‘death tax’ levy of up to 15 per cent to pay for elderly care have been revived by the Labour Party. The idea was floated before the last election by Labour but was dropped after intense criticism from the Conservatives. But Labour’s health spokesman Andy Burnham has restated his desire to introduce the scheme that would see estates of the deceased taxed at 15 per cent. Scroll down for video . Labour has revived plans to impose a compulsory ‘death tax’ levy of up to 15 per cent to pay for elderly care . The Tory Party has again derided the idea after it emerged that Labour was holding ‘internal party discussions’ on the issue. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt described the levy as a ‘secret tax bombshell’ and said ‘pensioners deserve better’. The plans will prompt criticism that Labour is targeting the wealthy, who are likely to be charged on top of the 40 per cent inheritance tax rate. The plan would also cost the average Briton £46,000 on a 15 per cent tax, the Conservatives claimed. Labour health spokesman Andy Burnham said that the death tax was 'the best way' to fund elderly social care - but admitted the plan was controversial . The social care green paper was first unveiled by Mr Burnham in 2009, which included a favoured compulsory insurance scheme. A later incarnation, which suggested pensioners should pay 10 per cent of their estates rather than a flat rate of £20,000, was lambasted by the Conservatives. The Coalition has pledged to tackle England’s care crisis scandal by stating that no one will have to pay their care costs if they spend more than £72,000. The rising cost of care can see the elderly facing unlimited expense, leading to tens of thousands having to sell their homes every year. Mr Burnham said the death tax was ‘the best way’ to fund social care – but admitted the plan was controversial. He added: ‘It’s only where you create a system where everyone is in and everyone is then covered, that I think you’ll be able to help people protect their own homes. ‘If you have that system, people would pay, let’s say, ten, 15 whatever it might be per cent, well then they would be able to pay that as an insurance payment to protect the other 85 per cent that they would otherwise stand to lose.’ Mr Hunt said: ‘People who save all their lives deserve better than a secret tax bombshell if Labour were ever to get in.’","Idea abandoned before last election after criticism from Tories .

"A teen who was left almost bald after pulling her own hair out has finally been given the golden locks of her dreams. Phoebe Ottomar, from Northampton, who suffers from trichotillomania, spent years tugging at her hair, leaving her with golf ball-sized bald patches. The 19-year-old was left devastated by the consequences of her habit - often refusing to leave the house - until she came across pioneering treatment that enabled her hair to grow back. Scroll down for video . The hair she always dreamed of: Phoebe Ottomar suffered from trichotillomia and spent years tugging at her hair, leaving her with golf ball sized bald patches but she discovered a pioneering treatment that enabled her hair to grow back . Phoebe is now taking part this week in International No Pulling Week, aimed at raising awareness about her hair pulling condition, called trichotillomania. Phoebe said: 'I felt like a completely new person since I had my new hair system, it’s fair to say it really has changed my life.' 'I don’t think you realise how important hair is until you’ve barely got any. 'For as long as I can remember I’ve always dreamt of having long hair, I used to be so envious of other girls in school. 'I was over the moon when I read about Lucinda Ellery and finally realised there was a way to get my hair back. 'It’s amazing that my real hair is actually growing now and I have my confidence back.' New look: Student Phoebe was left with virtually any hair after pulling it out but has finally been given the golden strands of her dreams thanks to a new treatment . As she was: Phoebe started pulling her hair out when she was really young and it got progressively worse until she was left with barely any hair . Discovery: Phoebe said: 'I went to therapy and tried hypnosis but nothing worked. It was when my mum noticed me pulling at my hair that we realised I had trichotillomania' Seeking help: Phoebe visited Lucinda Ellery, who used the Intralace System on her. While it is not a cure for hair pulling, it acts as a barrier and reminds the individual to not pull their hair . Phoebe, a languages student, began pulling her hair out at the age of eight. Trichotillomania is a condition where a person feels compelled to pull their hair out. They may pull out the hair on their head or in other places, such as their eyebrows or eyelashes. Trichotillomania is an impulse-control disorder (a psychological condition where you are unable to stop yourself carrying out a particular action). It is not known what causes trichotillomania, but there are several theories. Some experts think hair pulling is a type of addiction. The more you pull your hair out, the more you want to keep doing it. Trichotillomania may be a reflection of a mental health problem. Psychological and behavioural theories suggest that hair pulling may be a way of relieving stress or anxiety. In some cases, trichotillomania may be a form of self-harm, where you deliberately injure yourself as a way of seeking temporary relief from emotional distress. The most effective treatment is therapy to change your hair-pulling behaviour, combined with a network of emotional support. Visit your GP if you are pulling your hair out or if you notice that your child is. Source: NHS . She said: 'I started pulling my hair out when I was really young and I can remember looking at the hair root and being really fascinated. 'From there the pull became a release for me and I found it really therapeutic. 'When I was little we used to live in China and I think maybe the move back to the UK was what started it off. 'Then at secondary school it became worse - issues with friends and boys made me do it even more. 'People would constantly ask me why my hair was so thin and why I always put it up. 'Hair is so important to a teenage girl but I just didn’t have any and felt I couldn’t relate to any of the girls in my year. 'I hated whenever conversation topics turned to hair. I constantly found myself scraping my hair back into a granny-style bun to try and hide the hideous bald patches. 'I hated the windy weather as it would often blow the hairstyle out of place and reveal the sparse bits of hair. I would get so paranoid and stressed.' Phoebe would constantly pull at her hair - but no GP or specialist was able to say why. Phoebe said: 'I went to therapy and tried hypnosis but nothing worked. It was when my mum noticed me pulling at my hair that we realised I had trichotillomania. 'She’d seen an article about it in a woman’s weekly magazine and she knew I had the condition straight away.' Finally after hours of research with research with mother Joanne, 45, Pheobe discovered an answer to her problems. How does it work? The pioneering system has a mesh which is placed between the individual’s existing hair and their scalp . Clever: This intricate design also has an ultra-fine mesh containing human hair which is used to completely disguise any hair loss . Pheobe said: 'We came across Lucinda Ellery - the leading expert on my condition. 'Lucinda helped me realise that thousands of other women suffer like I have, and after discussing treatment, we decided the best option was the Intralace.' The Intralace System is not a cure for hair pulling but acts as a barrier and reminder to the individual to not pull their hair. Undiagnosed: Phoebe, pictured with huge patches in her scalp five years ago, would constantly pull at her hair - but no GP or specialist was able to say why . Youngster: Phoebe, pictured in primary school, found that the pull became a release for her and she found it really therapeutic . The pioneering system has a mesh which is placed between the individual’s existing hair and their scalp. This intricate design also has an ultra-fine mesh containing human hair which is used to completely disguise any hair loss. Pheobe said: 'I’ve been living with the system now for about five years and would never look back. 'My hair is really growing now and even when I try and pull my hair the system stops it from coming out. 'Not only has it helped my hair grow, but it’s also helped me to kick the habit of pulling in the first place. I hope that my story helps just one other person realise what the condition is and that they’re not alone. 'I no longer feel like a recluse and can finally do things that other teenagers do instead of hiding away. It’s great, no-one can tell the hair’s not really mine.' New look: Phoebe (L) with her sister Anna (R) hopes her story will help others who suffered the same condition as her . Lucinda said: 'Through education we can help millions more women across the world become pull free. 'It’s staggering that thousands of women in the UK suffer from trichotillomania the hair pulling disorder. 'International No Pulling Week hopes to raise awareness about the condition. The average woman who is likely to experience this condition starts around the age of puberty. 'The condition is considered to be connected with those who are highly intelligent, sensitive and working in a high powered, pressurised job. 'The neurobiological condition causes overwhelming urges to pull out your own hair and often is release for dealing with stress.' Thousands of women in the UK suffer from Trichotillomania (TTM), the hair pulling disorder, according to information released by hair loss expert Lucinda Ellery as part of International No Pulling Week.

"A little girl who had a crippling fear of dogs has overcome her phobia after being hypnotised, and now, she has a puppy of her own. Rebekah Kirby, 11, was so afraid of dogs she refused to leave the house in case she saw one. She developed the phobia after she was chased down the street by a neighbour’s poodle when she was three. Rebekah Kirby had a severe phobia of dogs but was cured by hypnotherapy and now has her own puppy, Vinnie . The schoolgirl from Hull was so scared the would physically shake and cry if she saw a dog - and was so terrified her mother, Louise, was forced to cancel trips to the beach and family camping holidays in case they came into contact with a pooch. Mrs Kirby, 38, was desperate to let her daughter live a normal life - and resorted to having Rebekah hypnotised to help her overcome her fear. After just a few sessions, Rebekah is completely over her fear - and even has a puppy of her own. Mrs Kirby said: 'It used to break my heart when I saw other children out playing and Rebekah inside because she was too afraid. 'Rebekah’s friends would invite her around to dinner but she wouldn’t ever go as she was too afraid of any dogs being there. 'It became so bad she would worry about leaving the house and her fear really had a big impact upon her life.' Rebekah (pictured with her parents, Louise and Paul) developed her phobia of dogs after she was chased down a street by a poodle when she was three . Rebekah's phobia was so bad that she would refuse to leave the house in case she saw a dog and would not go to friends' houses in case they had one. Her parents also had to cancel holidays in case they saw one . Rebekah’s fear only became worse with age, and despite the support of Mrs Kirby, and husband Paul, nothing seemed to help. When Mrs Kirby gave birth to William, now seven, she soon realised how much the little boy longed for a family pet. She said: 'William has always been fine with dogs and was desperate for a puppy of his own but with Rebekah’s phobia, it just wasn’t possible. Hypnotherapy is a type of complementary therapy that uses hypnosis - an altered state of consciousness. No one really knows how it works - some people think it relies on the placebo effect while others think it is the relaxation involved that helps. It can sometimes be used to treat IBS, skin conditions and anxiety. It has also been used to help people lose weight or stop smoking. Currently the NHS says there is no firm evidence to suggest it works. Source: NHS Choices . 'This was when Rebekah realised something had to change. She couldn’t keep living her life isolated from other children her age. She was missing out on playing with her friends and she didn’t want her feeling about dogs to start affecting her younger brother’s feelings.' Mrs Kirby decided to take Rebekah to see a hypnotherapist called Richard Scott. She paid £140 for a session with Mr Scott, where he spoke to Rebekah about her fears and gave her a CD to listen to at night. Mrs Kirby said: 'I was sceptical at first but I had run out of options. I just wanted to help Rebekah before she became any older and her situation worsened. 'After just a week Rebekah was already changing and starting to feel less anxious about the thought of being around dogs.' Mrs . Kirby was astounded at the change in Rebekah and when she suggested . visiting a family friend who had a dog, astonishingly Rebekah agreed. She . said: 'I could not believe it when she agreed to come too. It was . something she was petrified of before, but once we arrived she actually . managed to stroke a dog for the first time - though the garden gate.' Rebekah's parents decided to try hypnotherapy when their son, William (left), became desperate for a pet . And just weeks after finishing her course of hypnotherapy, the family have now bought Rebekah a puppy of her own, 10-month-old Vinnie, a Shar Pei. Mrs Kirby said: 'Rebekah and Vinnie are best friends. She loves him so much and her brother Will is delighted to have the dog he always wanted. 'Rebekah spends her days teaching Vinnie tricks and cuddling him. Everyone who knows her just cannot believe the change in her. 'Vinnie has completed our family and I am so happy that Rebekah can get on with her life now, without fearing dogs. Rebekah only needed a few sessions of hypnotherapy before she was cured of her phobia . 'Vinnie makes her so happy and he has helped her develop her confidence. She loves him more than anything and it is heart-warming to see.' Hypnotist Mr Scott said: 'Rebekah had a very acute fear of dogs when I first met her, which had a big impact on her life. 'I’m really pleased I was able to help her and her family, and it’s lovely to see her playing with her new puppy now.'","Rebekah Kirby developed the phobia after being chased down a street by one when she was three - it was so bad she wouldn't leave the house .

"Genetic: Mice taught to fear a certain smell pass this information on to their children through their sperm . The smell of fear can be inherited genetically and can be passed on for two generations, scientists have proved. For the first time researchers at Emory School of Medicine in Georgia have shown that if mice are taught to fear a certain smell this triggers chemical changes in their sperm. These changes then alter the makeup of their children and grandchildren's brains, causing them to fear the same smell. If the same is true of humans it could completely change the way we think about adult behaviour, and how we treat conditions such as post traumatic stress disorder. Kerry Ressler, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences, said: 'Knowing how the experiences of parents influence their descendants helps us to understand psychiatric disorders that may have a trans-generational basis, and possibly to design therapeutic strategies.' During the study mice were taught to associate the smell of cherry blossom with a mild electric shock. After a short time the mice reacted fearfully even if they were just exposed to the smell. Scientists then checked the mice's offspring and found that they also associated the odor with fear, despite never having been given an electric shock. They concluded that the trait must have been passed down genetically as the fathers never met their offspring, meaning the behaviour could not have been learned. This could completely change the way we think about conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder . Post-traumatic stress attacks have been shown to be triggered by smells, and scientists fear that soldiers could pass this information on to their children causing them to suffer . The offspring were not more nervous generally, and only reacted to the same smell their parents had been taught to be wary of. They were also able to pick up on very small amounts of the smell and had a larger space in their brain dedicated to detecting odors. The experiments also showed that the information can be passed down through the mother, and that it affects children whether they are conceived naturally or through IVF treatment. The study concluded that 'ancestral experience before conception' could be an under-appreciated affect on people's behavior, especially where parents had been through a particularly traumatising experience, such as a war-zone. Previous studies have shown that post-traumatic stress attacks can be brought on by particular smells and the fear is that soldiers could pass this fear on to their children, causing them to have similar attacks when they detect the same odor.","Mice taught to fear smells pass this information to their offspring .

"Looking at pictures of Hannah Rich posing confidently in just her underwear, it's hard to believe she was once so shy, she would have a panic attack if she met people she didn't know. The 23-year-old from Hull used to hate people looking at her and became too scared to leave the house because she feared socialising. Hannah's nervousness was so extreme, she would have sleepless nights worrying about having to travel for work on public transport and could be reduced to tears in business meetings. Confident: Hannah Rich is now a model after having hynosis to cure her anxiety problems . Can't stop me now! The 23-year-old once hated leaving the house . But now she has become a confident lingerie model after overcoming her crippling anxiety thanks to the power of hypnosis. Hannah explained: 'I used to have frequent anxiety and panic attacks, which were really severe and developed when I had to travel for work. 'If I had to travel somewhere for work in the morning I would be up the whole night before crying and worrying. 'It got to the stage when I was anxious to step out of my front door and it killed my social life. I would make up any excuse not to leave the house. I'd tell my boss and my friends that I was ill and I couldn't go out. Inhibiting: Hannah said she used to have panic attacks and worried about travelling for her job with a jewellers . No inhibitions: Now she's so confident she's happy to show off her body in selfies . 'I have always been quite reserved and doubted myself a lot but after having to travel for work, it escalated in way I could never have imagined.' Hannah had always dreamed of being a model but knew it would never be a reality because of her lack of confidence and anxiety. 'I entered into a beauty contest when I was seven and loved it. But as I grew up I didn't have the confidence to think about doing it properly,' she said. 'I would constantly worry that I wasn't good enough and be paranoid about what people would think of me. I was very unconfident and shy, and just couldn't deal with unfamiliar situations. 'It got to the stage where I was constantly crying, not sleeping and eating and finding myself unable to breathe.' Hannah worked as a visual merchandisers for a jewellery company and had to travel for up to a week at a time to different stores across the UK. The model says she can now pursue her dream career thanks to having hypnosis . She said: 'I'd worry about the entire journey from getting on the train, travelling to an unfamiliar place, having to hold leadership over staff and stores I didn't feel comfortable in, before proceeding on these journeys I would cry for days in advance and struggled to sleep. 'The more I had to travel, the more my panic escalated, I even broke down in tears a few times when I was away and whilst I was on the shop floor, when a panic attack hit, I'd struggle to breathe and felt like I was losing control of my own feelings and mind.' Her anxiety was so bad, she began getting in trouble at work when she would call in sick or make excuses not to go, and eventually her bosses agreed she wouldn't have to travel. But Hannah was still struggling to leave the house and was at her lowest ebb so she decided to give hypnotherapist Richard Scott, from Hull, a call. Transformed: She used to avoid going to unknown places and meeting new people but now loves socialising . Hannah spent £360 on eight hypnotherapy sessions with Richard at his clinic, Grey Matterz, in Hull and he helped her address her deep rooted self-esteem issues and through breathing and visualisation techniques. She said: 'I was sceptical at first but I had nothing to lose. I was so down and stressed it was worth a shot. 'I was actually amazed at the change I felt after the sessions - it was like Richard had completely changed my outlook and mental attitude.' Hannah has overcome her anxiety and now is confident enough to pose in underwear - after finally being able to pursue her dream of being a hosiery model. Look at me! Once she hated being looked at but now she loves to show off her body . Hannah now travels to photoshoots across the country with no problems and has no inhibitions about flashing some flesh in racy lingerie and stocking sets. She said: 'I absolutely love it and can't believe how I have turned my life around. Twelve months ago I would never have thought I would be confident and comfortable enough to leave the house and travel to see a photographer, and then strip off. 'I have received such positive feedback for my modelling and it has really given me the boost I needed. 'Before hypnotherapy I was unable to leave to house, but now I am travelling across the country and posing in these amazing underwear sets - and I am absolutely loving it.'","Hannah Rich, 23, used to suffer from panic attacks .

"A teenage Iraqi girl has told how she is being sexually abused on a daily basis after being captured by Islamic State fighters. The 17-year-old says she is among 40 Yazidi women being kept as sex slaves after their town was seized by the extremist group four weeks ago. She said her ordeal was so horrific she often wished she were beaten to death. Shocking: Members of the Iraqi Yazidi sect flee to refugee camps after their town was overrun by ISIS. One Iraqi girl (not pictured) has told of horrific treatment as a sex slave after being captured by the extremist group . 'There's a part of me that just wants to die,' she said. 'But there is another part of me that still hopes that I will be able to embrace my parents once again.' The girl was allowed to speak to Italian newspaper La Repubblica on her mobile phone because her captors wanted the world to know about her horrendous treatment, it was reported by The Daily Telegraph. Her parents, who fled to a refugee camp in Kurdistan, gave the newspaper her mobile number. She added: 'To hurt us even more, they told us to describe in detail to our parents what they are doing. 'They . laugh at us because they think they are invincible. They consider . themselves are supermen. But they are people without a heart. 'We've asked our jailers to shoot us dead, to kill us, but we are too valuable for them.' Barbaric: Islamic State fighters execute a line of Yazidi prisoners after taking over their town last month . She said some of the girls were as young as 13 and had been shocked into silence as a result of the abuse they had suffered. They are all being held in a building with barred windows which is guarded by armed fighters in a village south of the ISIS stronghold of Mosul, the girl said. The women were all snatched when the Islamic State stormed the town of Sinjar on August 3, forcing thousands of the minority Yazidi sect to flee into the nearby mountain of the same name. With tens of thousands trapped on the mountaintop by encircling jihadists, the U.S. and UK was called in to help with air strikes and aid drops, allowing many to flee to safety in Syria, Kurdistan and Turkey. But many women were captured, with some British jihadists boasting that they numbered in excess of 300.","Girl, 17, says she is among 40 Iraqi women being abused on a daily basis .

"South Africa set new records as they opened their World Cup campaign with a 62-run victory over Zimbabwe. Centurions David Miller and JP Duminy were the stars for the Proteas with an unbroken fifth-wicket partnership of 256 runs in less than 30 overs. The stand, a record partnership for South Africa in the competition, was also a new best for the fifth wicket in all World Cup matches. Dale Steyn of South Africa celebrates the wicket of Craig Ervine of Zimbabwe with his teammates . Imran Tahir hugs AB de Villiers of South Africa after dismissing Tinashe Panyangara at Seddon Park . It helped South Africa to reach 339 for four from their 50 overs, after they had made a sluggish start to the Pool B contest in Hamilton. The total proved too much for Zimbabwe, who could only manage 277 all out in reply as their final five wickets fell for just 41 runs. Yet the Proteas, put into bat, had struggled early on. The first over, bowled by Tinashe Panyangara, was a maiden - and they lost their first wicket in the fourth over when Quinton de Kock chipped a Tendai Chatara delivery straight to Craig Ervine and departed for seven. It was 21 for two in the ninth over when Hashim Amla was bowled by Panyangara for 11. Faf du Plessis and AB de Villiers shared a stand of 46 in 8.4 overs until Du Plessis was caught by Brendan Taylor off the bowling of Elton Chigumbura for 24. And 16 runs later it was 83 for four when some smart fielding on the boundary by Ervine enabled him to catch De Villiers for 25. However, that was as good as it got for Zimbabwe, as Duminy and Miller teamed up to devastating effect. JP Duminy bowls during the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup match between South Africa and Zimbabwe . The last six overs produced 112 runs, with Miller bringing up his century - off 81 balls - in the 46th. He took 30 runs from the 48th, bowled by Solomon Mire, and finished undefeated on 138, from 92 balls. His innings contained nine sixes and seven fours. Duminy reached his century in the final over, from 96 balls, and finished with 115 from 100 deliveries. His contribution included three sixes and nine fours. Zimbabwe lost Sikandar Raza for five in the seventh over when he chopped a Vernon Philander delivery on to his off stump with the team total on 32. Their first 100 runs came up in the 19th over, after Chamu Chibhabha had notched his 10th ODI fifty, but the opener departed shortly after when he holed out to Duminy at the extra-cover boundary to give Imran Tahir his first wicket of the competition. Hamilton Masakadza brought up his fifty in fine style by despatching Dale Steyn over the cover boundary for a sweetly-struck six, and he reached 80 before Tahir tricked him into spooning to cover. His 74-ball innings included eight fours and two sixes. Irvine takes a swing during the South Africa v Zimbabwe game in Hamilton, New Zealand . Captain Brendan Taylor picked up where Masakadza left off and he made a run-a-ball 40 before falling to Morne Morkel at the start of the 37th over. Zimbabwe were five down when Sean Williams top-edged Duminy to give wicketkeeper De Kock a routine catch. The loss of two quick wickets really hampered Zimbabwe's chances of winning the match and, with 106 required from the final 10 overs, their middle and lower order crumbled under the pressure. Chigumbura (eight) was run out in the 41st over by De Villiers, who took a regulation catch at mid on off Steyn's bowling to dismiss Ervine two overs later. De Villiers took his second catch of the innings to leave Zimbabwe eight down in the very next over as Tahir, who finished with figures of three for 36, tricked Panyangara into providing a leading edge as he attempted to sweep the leg-spinner. De Villiers had his third catch when he snaffled Mire (27) at deep mid-wicket. South Africa completed what in the end proved to be a comfortable victory when Morkel caught Tendai Chatara (six) off his own bowling as Zimbabwe were dismissed well short.

"A plane was forced to make an emergency landing after a passenger left their mobile phone charging in the toilet - triggering fears it was a bomb. The U.S-bound Delta Air Lines flight diverted to Dublin yesterday due to a 'possible security situation' after the device was found plugged into a socket, the company said. The Boeing 767-300, which was carrying 208 passengers from Istanbul, Turkey, was later cleared by Dublin Airport officials to continue its journey to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport. Panic: A U.S-bound Boeing 767 touches down at Dublin airport after a passenger triggered a bomb scare by leaving their mobile phone charging in the toilet . Emergency response: Police boarded the plane at Dublin airport (file picture) and soon established that the 'suspect device' was simply a phone . Irish Aviation Authority spokeswoman Lilian Cassin said the plane touched down safely at around 4pm and was diverted to an isolated corner of the runway after the pilot requested an emergency landing. Officers from Ireland's national police force, the Garda Siochana, boarded the plane, spoke to the pilot about the nature of the suspected bomb and asked any passenger missing their phone to come forward. One came forward to say they had decided to charge the phone using the restroom's socket for shavers and left it there, wrapped up in its charging cord. Another passenger using the restroom reported it might be a bomb. Terror in the air: Fifteen passengers were injured when this Virgin Airbus A330 was forced to make an emergency landing at Gatwick after a fire on board . Passengers heading off to the sun from Dublin got rather more heat than had bargained for when they were left sweltering on a plane for over nine hours. The torturous trip began when their Emirates flight was diverted to Ras Al-Khaimeh in the UAE after severe winds prevented it from landing in Dubai. But the majority were not allowed to leave the jet because of immigration issues. Instead they were left for hours with no water or air conditioning.One passenger fainted and another called it ‘hell’. A source said that Irish horse trainer Aidan O’Brien was on the flight travelling to the Dubai World Cup. Celia O’Connor Killeney, 55, from Galway, said: 'It was at least 38C. We were not able to leave our seats to stretch our legs which was very painful for me as I have arthritis.' An Emirates spokesman admitted the plane was not equipped to deal with such a lengthy delay and would offer passengers on the March 30 flight air miles as compensation. Police said nobody was hurt or arrested as a result of Monday's security alert, and the Dublin Airport Authority said no other flights were affected. Delta spokesman Anthony Black said the aircraft had 208 passengers and 11 crew members. He said the aircraft was refuelled before continuing its journey. Just a few hours earlier, a packed Virgin Airbus A330 had to make an emergency landing at Gatwick Airport in England after a blaze on board. Fifteen of the 299 passengers on the Florida-bound flight needed hospital treatment, many with suspected broken bones. The plane turned back just 15 minutes into its flight to Orlando as smoke began to fill the cabin. Some passengers accused the staff of panicking as the aircraft landed and its emergency chutes were deployed. Passenger Tom Alridge said one of the cabin crew got into a flap after the  plane touched down. ‘She was screaming like a banshee – “Get off, get off” – she was literally pushing people down the chute,’ he said. Scores of other flights in and out of the airport were suspended for nearly two hours, delaying thousands of passengers. The closure was the second to hit Gatwick in three days. On Friday, all outbound flights were briefly suspended after a hot air balloon drifted into the flight path. A Malaysia Airlines flight to London has been forced to return to Kuala Lumpur today after one of its engines began experiencing trouble shortly after take-off. The airline said the captain of the Boeing 747-400 plane carrying 351 passengers and 21 crew decided to turn back in the interest of passenger safety following a technical defect on one of the plane's four engines. It said in a statement that the aircraft landed safely two hours later and was grounded upon arrival. Defect: A Malaysia Airlines Boeing 747 like this one had to turn back to Kuala Lumper after suffering engine problems . Passengers were put on another plane to London eight hours later. A spokesman said the airline is still investigating the source of the problem. The plane uses US-made Pratt & Whitney engines.

"James Brokenshire, Minister for Security at the Home Office, said the publication of files has harmed national security . Security services are likely to lose track of terrorists and cyber criminals thanks to the Guardian’s publication of the stolen Snowden files, a security minister has warned. Huge damage has been inflicted on the UK’s national security because of the newspaper’s coverage of classified material taken by former US National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden. Home Office minister James Brokenshire was speaking in a Commons debate on the Guardian and its decision to reveal that GCHQ has access to the mass surveillance of citizens’ emails and phone calls. ‘There is no doubt that Snowden’s actions and the publication of material stolen by him have damaged UK national security,’ Mr Brokenshire said. He said anyone publishing details of intelligence gathering was giving away the capabilities that ‘we have relied on in recent years to stop terrorist plots, disrupt organised crime and put cyber criminals – including those exploiting children or illegally proliferating arms – behind bars.’ He added: ‘Once an adversary knows if and how we can read their communications they will change their behaviour.’ Mr Brokenshire suggested that this kind of action had led to the September 11 terrorist atrocity going ahead undetected. When it was revealed that Osama bin Laden’s communications were being disrupted in the late 1990s, ‘we didn’t hear from him again until September 2001’. The Tory minister said he could not go into detail about the ‘damage’ done by the Guardian but said: ‘We expect to lose coverage of some very dangerous individuals and groups. The threat remains very real. And only . through the tireless efforts of the police and intelligence agencies do . we keep those who wish us harm at bay. Secret intelligence gives us that . edge. The minister claimed whether Edward Snowden was a traitor or a whistleblower, his actions had endangered British Intelligence's ability to do its job . Regardless of whether you see Snowden as a whistleblower or traitor, revealing our capabilities destroys it.’ Tory MP Julian Smith, who initiated the debate, accused the Guardian of ‘stepping beyond any reasonable definition of journalism’ by ‘copying, trafficking and distributing files on British intelligence and GCHQ’. It was guilty of ‘risking their lives and those of their families’, he suggested. And he criticised the Guardian for sharing its information with the New York Times. In a statement on its website,  the Guardian said: ‘When responsible journalists working on the  same story share documents  they are engaged in journalism,  not terrorism.’","Home Office minister said leaking of Snowden files 'damaged UK national security'

"A bar of Kendal Mint Cake dating back to 1964, recently found in an attic, is believed to be the oldest in Britain. Peter Truelove, 68, bought the bar of . Robert Wiper’s Original Kendal Mint Cake when he and a friend visited . Kendal, Cumbria as 21-year-olds. The 48-year-old confectionery was made before the introduction of sell-by dates but is almost certainly still edible. Peter Truelove rediscovered the old bar in the loft of his home, in Windermere, Cumbria, together with a journal recording his 'boys' adventure' with a friend, and the fact that he'd bought the bar in nearby Kendal . Mr Truelove (above) and his friend had travelled from their homes in Kent to John O'Groats, the most northerly point on the Scottish mainland - and bought the bar on the way back . Wiper's invented the climbers’ favourite energy bar - made of glucose and peppermint - by accident back in 1869, while trying to make glacier mints. Mr Truelove rediscovered his old bar in the loft of his home, in nearby Windermere, together with a journal recording his 'boy’s adventure' with a friend, and the fact that he’d bought the bar. They had travelled from their homes in Kent to John O’Groats, the most northerly point on the Scottish mainland. 'We travelled the distance in an Austin 7 and it took us a week,' said Mr Truelove. Mr Truelove's journal documented the stop-off in Kendal. He said: 'I had to record everything we spent because my friend and I were splitting the cost of the trip' 'The car only did 35mph at best and it was blizzard weather - the snow was coming into the car. 'We called at Kendal on the way back and we’d heard about the mint cake, so when we saw some we thought we’d buy a bar.' Mr Truelove said he was not sure why he had kept the bar in a box in his loft. 'It was on a shelf as a memento of the trip but it’s been in the loft since we moved to Windermere 16 years ago,' he said. The bar is still in reasonable condition although some of the sugar is seeping through the wrapping. Although the original Wiper's recipe is still used, the company was sold to Romney's in 1987.

Managing director John Barron said: 'We have been making it all these years and I don’t think we have any that old - it’s impressive. 'It wouldn’t do him any harm to eat it now but I don’t expect it would taste very nice.' Mr Truelove said what was also interesting to discover was the journal he wrote while travelling, which documented the stop-off in Kendal. He said: 'I had to record everything we spent because my friend and I were splitting the cost of the trip. 'It’s funny now to look back and see that someone offered to sell us a car engine and gear box for £2.50, and that 15 litres of petrol was 60p. 'Unfortunately, the price of the mint cake wasn’t included, although I did write that we’d visited and purchased it.'",Peter Truelove said he was not sure why he'd kept the bar in a box in his loft .
"Chelsea Clinton has added another title to her resume as she received her doctorate degree from Oxford University on Saturday. The former first daughter was joined by her husband and famous parents as she collected her diploma from the prestigious university. She began her doctorate degree program in 2011 and completed most of the coursework from New York, where she and her husband Marc Mezvinsky live. All smiles: The former President and Secretary of State joined their daughter Chelsea and her husband Marc Mezvinsky at her doctorate graduation ceremony in Oxford on Saturday . The doctorate: Chelsea, 34, has been working on her PhD for the past three years . Runs in the family: Her father Bill studied at Oxford for two years as a Rhodes Scholar . The graduation ceremony was the first big accomplishment in a year that is expected to be full of milestones for the political family. Chelsea, 34, announced that she is pregnant with her first child and is due in the fall. Her mother, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, is largely seen as the front runner in the Democratic field for the 2016 presidential race and though she has not officially declared her bid, that is expected after the midterm elections this fall. Like her father, she first went to Oxford to get her master's degree immediately after her undergraduate studies at Stanford University. Faces in the crowd: University spokesmen said that the former President and his wife were at the campus in a 'private capacity' The shades are back: Hillary Clinton whipped out her sunglasses- which were the subject of an internet meme- after the ceremony . Walking through history: Chelsea announced that she and Marc are expecting their first child this fall . Following their footsteps: A crew of security guards trailed the Clintons throughout . She returned to the U.S. after finishing her master's in 2003, but then started a second degree at the school in 2011. She has been working on the dissertation focusing on international global governance structures with a focus on global health. Chelsea has also taken a much more active role in the family's charitable foundation this year and was named vice chairwoman of the organization. Bill Clinton got his undergraduate degree at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. but won a Rhodes Scholarship when he graduated and headed back to school. Specialized expertise: Chelsea's dissertation was about international global governance structures with a focus on global health . Getting together: The Clintons gathered and checked in on their cell phones before going to celebrate . Proud parents: 2014 is going to be a big year for the Clintons as they will become grandparents for the first time and Hillary is expected to announce her second presidential run . Sharing the moment: The social media-savy family didn't post anything about their trip to Oxford until after the graduation ceremony was over . Latest achievement: Chelsea Clinton now has four degrees . He studied philosophy, politics and economics at University College at Oxford from 1968 until 1970. He never ended up earning a degree from the school because he left early and returned to the United States to study law at Yale, where he would meet his soon-to-be wife. The former President recently joked about how academically ambitious his daughter was during an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live. 'She'll have as many (degrees) as her parents do - combined,' he joked. 'When she was younger, the way all kids . are, she thought she knew more than I did about everything. But alas, in . my dotage, it turned out to be true!' Old stomping grounds: Mr Clinton spent a year studying at the school as part of a Rhodes Scholarship program after he received his undergraduate degree at Georgetown . Taking in the country: The former President stopped to snap a picture of a bull with his camera phone . Though the couple apparently hoped to stay under the radar on this weekend's trip, they were pictured taking a leisurely stroll in the picturesque town on Friday afternoon before Chelsea arrived. At one point, the former President . stopped to take a picture of a bull who was behind a fence on the side . of the road using the camera on his phone. It doesn't look like that was intended to be shared, however. Both Clintons are active Twitter users but have kept their posts to a minimum and gave no hints about the intention of the trip on their social media accounts. Bill Clinton must be feeling slightly nostalgic of late because he gave a speech at Georgetown nearly two weeks ago and turned to Twitter to thank the students for coming out to listen to his speech in spite of bad weather.","The former President and Secretary of State arrived in Oxford Friday and were seen with Chelsea after her graduation this afternoon .

'The spacecraft landed almost exactly where it was forecast to,' he told Nasa television. Earlier NASA TV showed footage today of the . departing crew saying their farewells to the three astronauts left . behind before being shut into their cramped capsule. 'Although I will miss this place and . this crew, I also am very happy to return home to my family,' Burbank . said. 'It is time for Expedition 30 to step aside and make way for . Expedition 31.' The capsule undocked and began a slow, gentle drift away from the space station as scheduled at 0818 GMT. Its landing was aided by the deployment of several parachutes, which slowed its descent. Three small engines also fired to soften the landing. Happy days: Burbank (left) Shkaplerov (right) and Ivanishin on board the Space Station . Chocks away! This Nasa graphics shows how the Soyuz craft separated from the Space Station . Gently does it: The Soyuz craft was slowed down by thrusters and three parachutes . The Soyuz TMA spacecraft is composed of three elements attached end-to-end - the Orbital Module, the Descent Module and the Instrumentation/Propulsion Module. The crew occupies the central element, the Descent Module. The other two modules are jettisoned prior to re-entry. They burn up in the atmosphere, so only the Descent Module returns to Earth. The Orbital Module provided the crew with extra living space during the two-day trip to the Station. It contains systems vital to rendezvous and docking with the Station's Pirs Docking Compartment or other port - a docking mechanism, a hatch and rendezvous antennas. Having shed two-thirds of its mass, the Soyuz reached 'Entry Interface' - a point 400,000 feet above the Earth, where friction due to the thickening atmosphere heated its outer surfaces - three hours after undocking. With only 23 minutes left before it landed on the grassy plains of central Asia, attention in the module would have turned to slowing its rate of descent. Eight minutes later, the spacecraft streaked through the sky at a rate of 755 feet per second (514mph). Before it touched down, its speed slowed to only five feet per second (3mph), and it landed at an even lower speed than that. As the Soyuz made its gradual descent, one unidentified ground control staff member remarked that 'Anatoly (Ivanishin) must be real hungry right now' and that he would be looking forward to 'soup and some meat'. The retirement of the U.S. shuttle fleet has left Russia's Soyuz spacecraft as the only means to deliver crews to the space outpost. Russian cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko has now taken over as commander of the space station and will stay until July together with NASA astronaut Don Pettit and Holland's Andre Kuipers. They will now prepare for the arrival of first commercial cargo shipment to the space station in early May. The Space Exploration Technologies Corp., better known as SpaceX, launches its Dragon capsule from Cape Canaveral on April 30, and the capsule will take a few days to get to the space station. It will be the first time a private company has launched space station supplies. The space station will then return to its standard six-person crew with the arrival of NASA astronaut Joe Acaba and Russian colleagues Gennady Padalka and Sergei Revin, who will blast off from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on May 17.

"Police have found no human remains in a suburban garden where it was claimed a war veteran was involved in the killing of a woman more than 50 years ago. Forensic teams descended on the former home of Second World War RAF navigator Ronald Newell yesterday after one of his nine children claimed a woman called Laura had been buried there in the late 1950s. But relatives of Mr Newell insisted yesterday that the tip-off was a mistake and that police were wasting their time. This morning police confirmed no human remains had been found and said they believed the information was genuine. Scroll down for video .

'I . would very much like to thank the local residents from Rankine Road and . the surrounding area, for their co-operation and patience while we . carried out this essential investigative work.' Mr Newell, who worked as a bus driver . after the war, lived in the semi-detached house in Tunbridge Wells, . Kent, until he died aged 60 in 1981. The house has changed hands several . times since. Moved out: The family currently living at the property had to abandon their home during the search which ended today . One of Mr Newell’s children, Linda . Paintain, 58, told the Daily Mail last night that her sister Carol . Pennells, 66, went to the police claiming that her father and a group of . friends had been involved in the death of a young woman named only as . Laura. But Mrs Paintain and another sibling insisted their sister was . mistaken. Mrs Paintain, of East Farleigh, Kent, said: ‘My dad was quite a soft man. I can only remember him smacking me once.’ Her brother John Newell, 50, who lives . opposite the house that was searched, said yesterday: ‘The police are wasting their . time.

Two large white tents filled the . triangular garden of the house where police believed the human remains . had sat below the soil for around 60 years. Inside a forensic science team spent the day carrying out careful excavation-work, digging through the soil looking for bones. Officers in white overalls, lilac . gloves and hairnets worked busily in an area up several wooden stairs at . the end of the garden, behind a brick, tiled-roof shed. However, the white and blue . tarpaulin, pulled tight around the grassy area, hid their painstaking . work from neighbours in the surrounding tree-lined gardens. Soil removed from the yard was packed . into black dustbins stored alongside the two tents, during the . meticulously-planned operation. Eighteen police vehicles were also parked outside and uniformed officers kept a constant presence in the suburban street.

"It was no doubt a weekend to remember as she and her husband-to-be George Clooney celebrated their upcoming nuptials with a group of close pals. But on Tuesday it was back to reality for Amal Alamuddin, who was spotted arriving into Heathrow airport alone... although she still received the VIP treatment from airport staff. The human rights lawyer, who was no doubt returning to work, was seen chatting away excitedly as she made her way through the airport in London… flashing her £450,000 seven-carat diamond engagement ring as she did so. Scroll down for video . Back to Blighty: Amal was seen  arriving at London's Heathrow on Tuesday . On show: The lawyer revealed her large engagement ring as she pushed her hair off her face . Proving once again that she is both brains and beauty, the 36-year-old looked cool in a pair of ripped, loose fitting jeans which featured a turn-up. Making sure she was comfy for her flight the Brit wore a taupe coloured top with matching cardigan, while she added a cool twist with a pair of silver brogues.

On Sunday the lawyer, who famously represented WikiLeaks' founder Julian Assange, was seen heading to Café Habana, the restaurant owned by his business partner Rande Gerber, in Malibu, California, alongside the Hollywood heartthrob. As well as celebrating his engagement, George was also celebrating his 53rd birthday - and shared a party with Bono, who turned 54 on May 10 as well as Bono's daughter Jordan, who shares her dad's birthday and turned 25, as well as Rande, who turned 52 on April 27.

"Meditating can make you warmer, researchers studying ancient Tibetan techniques have found. Scientists in Singapore say the discovery means core body temperature can be controlled by the brain - and could have major implications for people working in extreme environmentsd . The researchers have discovered that core body temperature can be increased by using certain meditation techniques. They believe that meditation could, therefore, also be used to help people to function in very cold environments. Tibetan nuns are able to use meditation techniques to increase their core body temperature . The team of researchers at the National University of Singapore showed for the first time that g-tummo meditation has been used by Tibetan nuns to increase their core body temperature. Previous research has only shown that g-tummo meditators are able to increase the peripheral body temperature in their fingers and toes. The researchers, who published their findings in the journal PLoS ONE, collected data during a unique ceremony in Tibet in which nuns raised their core body temperature and dried wet sheets which were wrapped around their bodies in -25 degree Celsius temperatures. Using electroencephalography (EEG) recordings and temperature measures, the team observed increases in core body temperature up to 38.3 degree Celsius - normal body temperature is 37 degrees Celsius. A second study was then conducted with Western participants who used a breathing technique of the g-tummo meditative practice and they were also able to increase their core body temperature, within limits. The findings from this study showed that specific aspects of the meditation techniques can be used by non-meditators to regulate their body temperature through breathing and mental imagery. G-tummo is a form of yoga found in Tibetan teachings. Its purpose is to gain control over the body's processes. It uses a system of visualisations and breathing techniques including 'vase breathing'. Vase breathing involves breathing into the abdomen and then not releasing all of the air from the belly before taking another breath. This form of yoga is most commonly found in the Himalayas. It can enable people to increase the temperature of their extremities and can also be used to change metabolism rates. This could allow them to adapt to, . and function in, cold environments and could reduce performance problems . associated with decreased body temperature. The two aspects of g-tummo meditation that lead to temperature increases are ‘vase breath’ and concentrative visualisation. ‘Vase breath’ is a specific breathing technique which causes thermogenesis, which is a process of heat production. The other technique, concentrative visualisation, involves focusing on a mental image of flames along the spinal cord in order to prevent heat losses. Both techniques work in conjunction leading to elevated temperatures up to the level of moderate fever. Associate Professor Maria Kozhevnikov from the Department of Psychology at the National University of Singapore, said: ‘Practicing “vase breathing” alone is a safe technique to regulate core body temperature in a normal range. A second study using Western participants showed that they were also able to increase their core body temperature using breathing and mental imagery . ‘The participants whom I taught this technique to were able to elevate their body temperature, within limits, and reported feeling more energised and focused. ‘With further research, non-Tibetan meditators could use “vase breathing” to improve their health and regulate cognitive performance.’ Monasteries maintaining g-tummo traditions are very rare and are mostly located in the remote areas of eastern Tibet.","Tibetan nuns increase their body temperatures using g-tummo meditation .

"Gary Neville has claimed winning the Premier League title is better than having children in the wake of Manchester City's triumph. City secured their second title in three years after a comfortable 2-0 victory over West Ham thanks to goals from Samir Nasri and Vincent Kompany either side of half-time. Speaking after the game, Neville, who won the title with Manchester United on eight occasions and has two children, said: 'Winning the Premier Legaue trophy is the best thing that can happen to you.

"A Philadelphia couple were found guilty of the third-degree murder of their son after pleading 'no contest today. Herbert and Catherine Schaible's 7-month-old son Brandon died last April 18 from dehydration and pneumonia when his parents decided to pray for him to get better rather than seek medical attention. At the time, the Schaibles were on 10-year probation for their 2-year-old son Kent's similar death in 2009. The terms of their probation required the Schaibles to seek medical attention any time one of their seven surviving children got sick. Guilty: Herbert and Catherine Schaible were found guilty of the third-degree murder of their 7-month-old son today after pleading 'no-contest' The fundamentalist Christian couple will face sentencing February 19 for their crime. 'I can't even imagine being a mother myself, what was happening,' Philadelphia prosecutor Joanne Pescatore said. 'The sheer pain and the stress that that child was in. When a parent can actually say that his breathing was worsening and he was fussy and whiny and crying and still, at that point, not calling anyone for help, it's just unbelievable to me - and totally foreseeable (that he died).' About a dozen U.S. children die each year when parents turn to faith healing instead of medicine, typically from highly treatable problems, according to experts. Repeat offenders: When their 7-month-old son Brandon died in April, the couple were on 10-year probation for their 2-year-old son Kent's similar death in 2009 . The Schaibles are third-generation members and former teachers at the First Century Gospel Church, a small, insular congregation in northeast Philadelphia. ‘We believe in divine healing, that Jesus...died on the cross to break the devil's power,’ Herbert Schaible told homicide detectives after Brandon died. Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams said the care was never given and decided to bring murder charges against the couple. Their remaining children have been placed in foster care. ‘He is incarcerated because of his faith,’ said lawyer Bobby Hoof in May when the couple was ordered held without bail. He described client Herbert Schaible's mindset as resolute. Faith-healing: First Century Gospel Church, where the parents are members, says using medicine is a sin . ‘We believe in divine healing, that Jesus shed blood for our healing and that he died on the cross to break the devil's power,’ Herbert Schaible told Philadelphia homicide detectives in April. Medicine, he said, ‘is against our religious beliefs.’ ‘These are people who have been brought up in these communities; their beliefs are reinforced every day,’ said Shawn Francis Peters, a University of Wisconsin lecturer who has studied faith-healing deaths. ‘They're not trained intellectually to question these doctrines, where the rest of us might engage in critical inquiry, weighing the benefits of medicine versus the benefits of prayer,’ he said. Peters isn't sure that courts have the means to prevent the problem, since such people don't fear legal punishment, only Judgment Day. Some believe death ‘is a good outcome,’ given their belief in the afterlife, he said. Extreme: Pastor Nelson Clark of the First Century Gospel Church tells followers to shun 21-century medicine for the power of prayer . ‘They don't want to harm their children. They're just in this particularly narrow - and very, very dangerous - way misguided about the potential of medical science,’ he said. He believes that ‘empathetic’ intervention, through dialogue between church and public health educators, could help some ‘get to a point where they allow their beliefs and practices to evolve.’ But there's also a risk that could backfire, and drive these communities further underground, he said. It is . estimated that around a dozen U.S. children die in faith-healing cases . each year, a handful of which spawn criminal charges, according to . experts. The First Century Gospel Church of Philadelphia’s teachings has clashed with authorities in the past. In . 1991, eight children died in a measles outbreak. All the parents were . members of either First Century Gospel Church or the nearby Faith . Tabernacle of Nicetown which also preaches faith-healing. In . 2011, Dale and Shannon Hickman of Oregon were sentenced to 75 months in . prison after turning to faith healing to say their premature newborn, . which was born in a family home, died from complications that could have . easily been averted with medical care. Also . in Oregon, Jeff and Marci Beagley, were sentenced to 16 months in 2010 . for the death of their 16-year-old son. The couple refused to use . medicine for their son Neil, who was suffering from a preventable . urinary tract blockage. Instead, they prayed and used anointing oils in . the hope of divine intervention. 'Too . many children have died unnecessarily - a graveyard full,' Judge Steven . Maurer said at their sentencing. 'This has to stop.' Oregon has since banned faith healing as a defense against murder charges.","Herbert and Catherine Schaible pleaded 'no contest' to third-degree murder charges today in relation to their 7-month-old son Brandon's April death .

"Jonathan Joseph sent a clear warning to Ireland after his man-of-the-match performance inspired England to an emphatic Six Nations win over Italy. The Bath centre grabbed two of England’s six tries at Twickenham and claimed his best is yet to come in the tournament. England’s next game is in Dublin on March 1 - a showdown between the two remaining unbeaten teams after Ireland saw off France 18-11 at the Aviva Stadium. His Bath team-mate George Ford added 15 points with the boot. Joseph, 23, has been hailed as the ‘new Jeremy Guscott’ with his silky running prowess and dashing finishing skills. He said: ‘It’s great to be compared to someone like him. He was someone with such class and ability who had such a great career with Bath and England. Jonathan Joseph enjoyed the comparisons to Jeremy Guscott after his man-of-the-match performance . The comparisons come from the silky running prowess and finishing skills that the two players share . Joseph scored two tries in a world-class display for England against Italy at Twickenham . After also going over against Wales, Joseph now has three tries to his name in this year's RBS 6 Nations . 'But it’s up to me to keep working hard and keep my feet on the ground. I am not the finished article and can get better. I just want to try to be the best I can. It felt great to get two tries in an England win but things move on quickly and you can’t sit back and relax.’ Joseph was forced to move out to the wing after full back Mike Brown went off with a head injury early in the first half. But the reshuffle didn’t faze the Bath man, who said: ‘I feel I can play either centre or wing but I prefer centre. 'I try to deliver on a regular basis and I need to keep pushing myself. I have trained and worked hard at Bath. I’ve found that if I stay close to George he usually creates something for me. Credit to him today because he helped me go over the whitewash. ‘Missing out on New Zealand last year was a big blow for me. It hurt. But missing that opportunity made me even more determined to get where I wanted to be. ‘I didn’t have a great season and had injuries. But it was a realisation that a lot of my friends were out there and that’s where I wanted to be.’ Joseph crosses over for his second try, but wants to keep his feet on the ground ahead of facing Ireland . The 47-17 win at Twickenham saw some early mistakes from England which need to be ironed out . Joseph set his sights on the battle with Ireland and said: ‘It will be another big one and there are a few errors to iron out. Ireland are a tough side and it will be a massive challenge. We will have to prepare well for that game.’ But Stuart Lancaster said his young side, who beat Wales in Cardiff last Friday, lacked intensity in defence early on as Sergio Parisse crossed. The head coach said: ‘I am disappointed really. I thought we lacked the intensity we had in defence last week. We addressed it in the second half but the last try was a frustrating one. ‘I guess at the start of the day, if someone had said we would get 47 points, I would have taken it. I know how good and how difficult this Italian team are to play against having been 18-11 this time two years ago.’ England lost Brown to a worrying injury after 10 minutes and Lancaster hailed his bravery. The full back was left unconscious after a collision with Italy centre Andrea Masi and had seven minutes of treatment before being taken off on a stretcher. George Ford (10) and Joseph seem to be enjoying playing together, as shown in this try celebration . The Azzurri backline struggled to deal with Joseph, and Ireland will be wary of him too . The 29-year-old reappeared on the touchline in the second half and will undergo strict return-to-play protocols before being considered to face Ireland. Lancaster said: ‘It was a very dangerous moment. It was a great chip over the top and — typical Mike — he was brave and it was a try-saver. ‘He is talking fine now and he seems OK. It certainly helps the fact that it is two weeks and a day (until Ireland) but we will take him through the return-to-play protocol. I spoke to him in the changing room and he was grumpy that he had to miss the game and frustrated — but he is grumpy anyway. ‘We have a training week coming up and he won’t take any part in that. We will see how he goes in the lead-up to the Ireland game.’ Brown’s injury came at the worst possible time for a sport facing a huge challenge to combat an alarming rise in head injuries over the past decade. Mike Brown had to be taken off after suffering a head injury that saw him bleeding from his nose . With the clash against Ireland now on the horizon, Joseph hopes England can stop the mistakes in the break . Stuart Lancaster had issues with the way his side played but congratulated his man-of-the-match afterwards .","England's two-try hero was delighted with comparisons to Jeremy Guscott .

"Florida is on alert as a toxic red tide, the biggest since 2005, is threatening holidaymakers as it moves down the coast. The red tide, with the scientific name of Karenia brevis, is caused by microscopic algae blooms that explode in numbers when the conditions are right. Usually a phenomenon that occurs in late summer or early autumn, the tide can produce harmful chemicals and cause respiratory problems. If the red tide gets within a mile of the beach, the crashing waves could release the toxins into the Florida air . Don Anderson, a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, told NBC News: 'These kinds of blooms damage wildlife, people, tourism, everything. It can kill fish by the millions.' The red tide can be also be damaging to people, especially those suffering from chronic asthma, bronchitis, or emphysema. Even those who don't suffer from respiratory conditions can feel the red tide's effects. Humans near the bloom may experience coughing, sneezing, itchy skin and teary eyes. The dark red tide is clearly visible on the right-hand side, and more sparsely on the bottom left-hand side . 'When the wind blows, you can't really breathe,' said Anderson, who has experienced it first-hand. 'You start wheezing and coughing and you have to wear a surgical mask or move inland.' The microorganism can only be seen with a microscope. While it is always present in the Gulf of Mexico in negligible amounts, large blooms turn the sea a reddish brown color. The red tide is caused by microscopic algae blooms that explode in numbers when the conditions are right . The current bloom is around 20 miles off the coast of Florida, too far away to affect beachgoers, at least for the meantime. While the red tide appears almost every year, officials have not seen one this size since 2005. It is currently thought to be stretching 90 miles long, 60 miles wide and at least 100 feet down. So far, the animal death count in the sea is moderate. Around 1,000 fish and some crabs and octopi have been killed, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, but that could change if it moves closer to shore. Holidaymakers could be in danger if the red tide drifts to within a mile of the beaches. Once it’s that close, the crashing waves can release the toxins into the air. Around 1,000 fish and some crabs and octopi have been killed by the red tide . While humans risk a few nights resting in bed, the powerful toxins are much more harmful in other animals and can kill fish, shellfish, mammals and birds. In 2013, a smaller red tide bloomed closer to the Florida shore, resulting in the deaths of 276 of the state’s 5,000 manatees. The endangered mammals eat the toxic algae when it settles on the sea grass that they feed on. In 2004, around 100 dolphins were found dead in the same area. When scientists examined their stomachs, they found fish contaminated by the algae. Red tides are a natural phenomenon that happen almost every year and are very unpredictable. There is no real way to stop them. Two underwater robots from Mote Marine Laboratory and the University of South Florida have been  monitoring the red tide in Florida and surrounding oceans since they were deployed on 1 August. The results from the robots are helping to shape short-term bloom forecasts.","Red tide is caused by a huge bloom of microscopic toxic algae .

"Two antique ships are set to be repainted with special 'dazzle' camouflage as part of an art project marking the 100th anniversary of the First World War. Modern artists are designing a unique pattern for the vessels, which are currently docked in London and Liverpool after being taken out of active service. The initiative is part of a series of projects announced yesterday which will commemorate the centenary of the conflict's outbreak in 1914. Camouflage: HMS Kildangan painted with a dazzle design in 1918 in order to disguise it from the enemy . Project: The Edmund Gardner, a pilot cutter now in dry dock in Liverpool, will be repainted in dazzle . Art: HMS President, moored on the Thames in London, will also be repainted . The dazzle ships are based on the paint used to disguise British and American warships during the Second World War. They were decorated with black and white jagged lines in a bid to make it more difficult for the enemy to work out their exact position and the direction they were travelling. The Edmund Gardner, a pilot cutter now in dry dock in Liverpool, will be repainted by Venezuelan artist Carlos Cruz-Diez and unveiled in June this year. Another artist yet to be announced will paint the HMS President, which is moored on the Thames near the Victoria Embankment in London. Historic: HMS Argus, an aircraft carrier, was one of the many ships painted in dazzle in order to make it harder for the Germans to determine their speed and direction of travel . Inspiration: Steamship Lake Capens, built in 1918 in Wisconsin, was painted in a dazzle pattern . Dazzle camouflage, used during the First World War, was an example of the collaboration of art with national defence. Inspired by cubist and vorticist artworks, painter Norman Wilkinson proposed painting ships with jagged stripes and lines in a bid to cut down on the number lost to the Germans. Although the camouflage did not actually disguise the ships, it distorted their shape when seen from far away. This made it harder for the Germans to work out how fast they were sailing and in which direction, reducing the accuracy of their guns. A total of 2,000 ships from the Royal Navy and the U.S. fleet were repainted in a dazzle design in 1917 and 1918, with each one being unique so the Germans could not identify classes of ship by their markings. The camouflage fell out of favour by the 1940s, because it was rendered useless by the introduction of radar. The President was previously painted in dazzle camouflage during the First World War, when it was deployed as a submarine hunter tracking down German U-boats. 14-18 NOW, the charity responsible for the project, said: 'These eye-catching additions to the dockside scenery remind local people and visitors of the crucial role ships played in the country’s wartime survival.' Dazzle camouflage was originally inspired by modernist artworks, making it a poignant choice for the national art project. The camouflaged ships would have been an everday site during the First World War, when they were docked around Britain in between missions. Other initiatives announced yesterday include a letter-writing project and an hour's darkness across the UK on the night of the centenary. The Lights Out project is inspired by then foreign secretary Sir Edward Grey’s remark at the outbreak of the war that: ‘The lamps are going out all over Europe, we shall not see them lit again in our lifetime.’ People will be asked to turn off their lights and replace them with either a candle or a specially commissioned digital light which will be available to download for free. Unique: Each dazzle pattern was different and no two ships looked the same; the Jan Beydell is pictured in 1919 carrying Field Marshal Haig . A commemorative late-night prom at the Royal Albert Hall will see German composer Torsten Rasch and the Philharmonia Orchestra perform a 40-minute work featuring verse by writers including Robert Frost, Edward Thomas and Rupert Brooke. Members of the public have been invited to write a 'letter to an unknown soldier', inspired by a statue at Paddington station of a serviceman reading a letter. Project director Jenny Waldman said: 'We are commissioning some of the world's leading artists to respond to the events of the First World War and the wider social political, cultural and scientific developments of the period. 'I am particularly delighted about the way artists have responded to the brief and the wonderful enthusiasm our cultural organisations have shown in their support for the programme.'","Ships docked in Liverpool and London will be repainted with the design used during the First World War to hide them from the Germans .

According to the filing, Friedman said the Oscar-winning actor treated O'Donnell 'in the same manner as if she were a spouse'. Hoffman told the accountant that he just didn't believe in marriage. The court-appointed attorney says the actor's will should be approved by the court because there isn't anything suspicious about it. Attorney James Cahill Jr., interviewed Hoffman's accountant as part of his court-appointed duties to protect the interests of Hoffman’s children, Cooper, ten, Tallulah, seven, and five-year-old Willa, according to the New York Post.

"Blackpool’s attempts to replace Jose Riga as manager have hit a stumbling block after talks with Owen Coyle slowed down in the past 24 hours. The relationship between Riga and chairman Karl Oyston has broken down over transfer policy and what the manager perceives to be a series of false promises emanating from the boardroom. Oyston is livid that after six successive defeats to start the campaign, Riga returned to his native Belgium last week - Sportsmail understands the Belgian was on a scheduled family break that had been agreed with the club - rather than focus on improving the fitness of a squad which played just two pre-season games over the summer. In the frame: Owen Coyle looked poised to take the reins at Championship strugglers Blackpool . The chairman decided to bring an end to Riga’s reign this weekend but the Belgian was not informed over the club’s intentions and took training on Monday and Tuesday after returning to England. Coyle, who is understood to have previously rejected the Blackpool job twice before, was in line to take the job. However, it is believed that an agent has become involved in the deal and a source close to the club has indicated that Oyston, who traditionally refuses to pay representatives, has now become unhappy. Coyle, for his part, is believed to have concerns over the working conditions of a club that is in utter disarray. It is thought that he and his assistants have been warned about the situation at the club by previous employees of Oyston. Under pressure: Jose Riga has been criticised for heading back to Belgium during the international break . The deal with Coyle is not dead in the water and could yet be revived as the loveless marriage with Riga appears unsustainable. In an interview with the Blackpool Gazette on Tuesday, Oyston remained coy on whether Riga would be shown the exit door, but the chairman did stress his fury at the manager's actions over the past week. 'Until I've spoken to Jose personally, I don't want to comment about the speculation or go into it in too much detail,' said Oyston. 'However, I have to say I find myself slightly bemused yet again by the actions of our manager. 'He has said, on many occasions on the record, that he would use the international break to get the players up to fitness and to work with the squad we now have. The first thing the manager does is hop on a plane and clear off to Belgium for a week without telling anyone. 'Let's face it, we've lost every competitive game he's managed and these actions aren't the most professional way to get us out of this position. To hop on a plane without telling your employer or your colleagues isn't right. It's something I will be speaking to him about.' It is likely that Oyston will have to come to a financial settlement with the manager if he wants him to leave. Burton’s Gary Rowett is an alternative if Coyle cannot be secured.","Owen Coyle was tipped to replace Jose Riga as Blackpool boss .

'The audience was relatively small so everyone got a chance to have a good look and really have a chance to witness something amazing.

"Miscarriage of justice? A Kenyan lawyer has petitioned the International Criminal Court to have Jesus' conviction and death sentence quashed . A Kenyan lawyer has petitioned the International Court of Justice to overturn the trial and conviction of Jesus Christ and his subsequent death sentence. Dola Indidis, a former spokesman of the Kenyan Judiciary, is attempting to sue, among others, the Republic of Italy and the State of Israel over the execution of the Christian Messiah. He has turned to the Netherlands-based court, which usually hears matters of international law, after an attempt to file the suit at the High Court of Nairobi was thrown out in 2007. Mr Indidis hopes to have Jesus' conviction quashed. 'His selective and malicious prosecution violated his human rights through judicial misconduct, abuse of office bias and prejudice,' the lawyer told Kenyan paper The Nairobian. Few apparent miscarriages of justice have reverberated as far and as long as the conviction and crucifiction of Jesus more than 2,000 years ago. According to the New Testament, the Messiah ran into trouble after performing miracles and claiming he was the son of God, prompting Jewish authorities to arrest him on charges of blasphemy. They brought Him to Pontius Pilate, then the Roman Governor of Judea, who told them he did not have jurisdiction to hear the case and sent him to King Herod, who sent him back to Pilate. Pilate found Jesus not guilty of any charges but, after crowds of angry Jews called for Him to be executed, the governor gave in and had him crucified alongside two criminals. Mr Indidis's case challenges the mode of questioning used during Jesus' trial; the punishments meted out to Him while proceedings were still underway; and the substance of the information used to convict him. He hopes to establish what crime Jesus was charged with and hopes the court declares that 'the proceedings before the Roman courts were a nullity in law for they did not conform to the rule of law at the material time and any time thereafter.' 'Some of those present spat in his face, struck him with their fists, slapped him, taunted him, and pronounced him worthy of death,' he added. See you in court: Dola Indidis, a former spokesman of the Kenyan Judiciary, is attempting to sue, among others, the Republic of Italy and the State of Israel over the execution of the Christian Messiah . Mr Indidis hopes to rely on the precedent set in the case of Joan of Ark, the peasant girl who proclaimed herself a warrior sent by God to deliver France from the English, whose trial and conviction was later found unsound. 'This is the same case with Jesus. The judge who sentenced him said that he had no jurisdiction to attend to the matter but he went ahead to convict and pass a capital sentence under duress,' he said. Legal experts do not expect Mr Indidis's efforts to be a success, ironically because the ICJ does not have legal jurisdiction. Anthea Roberts, professor of law at Columbia Law School, told Time magazine's Swampland political blog: 'The International Court of Justice only has jurisdiction to hear claims that are brought by one state against another state. 'As this claim is not brought by a state, the ICJ would lack jurisdiction over it.'",Dola Indidis believes trial and execution violated Jesus' human rights .
"The mayhem enveloping Blackpool is continuing apace as a feud between Karl Oyston and former assistant manager Bart De Roover was reignited on Tuesday. De Roover left his post last week after refusing to sign a contract at Bloomfield Road - outspoken in slamming the way in which the underfire chairman runs the club. The breaking of promises regarding the playing budget and dilapidated training ground were central to his discontent. Feud: De Roover (right) has criticised the way Blackpool has been run since leaving the club last week . Oyston opted to bite back a weekly column for the town’s newspaper, poking fun at the ex-coach despite the Seasiders becoming embroiled in a farcical situation whereby manager Jose Riga doesn’t know whether he is to be sacked or not. ‘It was interesting to see the comments made by Bart De Roover on his exit last week,’ Oyston penned. ‘I think sometimes in football when people don't get their own way they tend to make a disproportionate crisis of it and I think that's what Bart's done. ‘He knew exactly what he was coming to when he came and if he didn't, more fool him. The fact he's reacted the way he has after not getting his own way probably says a lot about him.’ De Roover attempted to keep his cool when speaking to Sportsmail and refused to become involved in a slanging match. Fighting back: Oyston responded to his former employee's claims by mocking his coaching abilities . ‘I’ve only just stopped laughing,’ the Belgian said. ‘It’s unbelievable. This is getting ridiculous now. Disrespectful is too nice a word. It’s beyond a joke.’ De Roover turned down a contract offer and wasn’t paid during his time on the Fylde Coast. ‘Karl Oyston doesn’t accept no for an answer,’ he added. ‘He promised everything would be improved but we saw nothing in two months. ‘I don’t know another chairman who reacts like that. You should work with your team and players, not against them. ‘I don’t want to stoop to that level. I respect the gaffer, the players and the fans too much.’ Oyston also asserted that De Roover’s natural coaching level was ‘the lower leagues in Belgium,’ adding that the club ‘back his sensible decision to return’. Poor start: On the field Blackpool are yet to pick up a single point from their five Championship games . That clearly irked the 47-year-old: ‘I’ve trained at the highest level in Belgium. I have got my Pro licence.’ Oyston is likely to sack Riga after Blackpool lost each of their opening six competitive fixtures this season, and had lined up Owen Coyle as his replacement. That, however, looks increasingly problematic after serious disputes arose over a five-figure fee due to the Scot’s agent. Oyston is renowned for not paying intermediaries. Riga took training on Monday and Tuesday before meeting the chairman for talks over his immediate future. Oyston also took aim at the boss in his column, saying: 'I have to say I find myself slightly bemused yet again by the actions of our manager. 'He has said, on many occasions on the record, that he would use the international break to get the players up to fitness and to work with the squad we now have. 'The first thing the manager does is hop on a plane and clear off to Belgium for a week without telling anyone.'

"Valerie Baber was one of several prostitutes out of the job when New York escort service the Emperors Club was busted in 2008, following a federal investigation of then-Governor Eliot Spitzer . A former prostitute at the escort agency famously exposed in the federal investigation of then-New York Governor Eliot Spitzer has written an essay about her time as a sex worker, after leaving the business to get her master's degree. Valerie Baber went by the name Racquel when she worked at the Emperors Club - a prostitution service for VIPs in New York that was disbanded in 2008 following the revelation that Governor Spitzer was 'Client 9'. But Baber only has positive reviews of working at the Emperors Club, and even admits enjoying some of the sex she had with Forbes-listers, royalty, politicians, athletes, celebrities and industry titans. Baber says '90 per cent' of her clients were attractive and influential people who didn't have to pay for sex but did it out of convenience or addiction. 'In my dealings with clients, I often felt like they could be addicts,' she said. 'But I didn't mind, and it has never been my job to overthink it.' She adds that the work wasn't always easy. Most of the men she slept with made her do all the work in the bed. 'That's how all of my clients preferred it. I guess if I were paying $1,500 an hour, I wouldn't want to do any work either,' she said. Among her regular clients were 'professional gamblers and boxers, top-tier doctors and lawyers, high-flying finance types, an Ivy league professor and several successful entrepreneurs.' Baber liked being a prostitute because she could make more in one hour than seven hours dancing as a stripper, one of her previous occupations. 'A high-end agency would allow me to take a break from the unhealthy world of gentlemen’s clubs. I’d need to meet with only one man instead of 40. I wouldn’t have to be around a group of vapid people in various stages of chemical alteration, and unlike the guys I had to approach at the club, I knew the men I’d meet through a service would be guaranteed to want my company—they would have already handpicked me,' she said. 'I’d also be able to get to bed at a reasonable time and get up in the morning with the rest of the normal world. ' Busted: Eliot Spitzer (left) resigned after it was revealed that he patronized the Emperors Club, and consorted with prostitute Ashley Dupre (right) Client 9: Baber worked at Emperors Club with Dupre (pictured above), who went by the name Kristen and was caught by federal investigators setting up 'meetings' with Spitzer . But her life of easy money came crashing down the day she received a phone call from Agent Kenneth Hosey, asking to meet as soon as possible. Baber lawyered up and signed a proffer agreement to divulge everything she knew about the club to federal investigators. While she knew prostitution was against the law, Baber didn't know why she was being targeted. 'I felt violated and confused. Why was it anyone’s business what I did in my private life? I hadn’t hurt anyone. I paid my taxes. I helped women with strollers down subway stairs. 'I was made to feel as though I had done something truly horrible. But I knew with every fiber of my being that I had done nothing wrong. In fact, I’m still unsure what “crime” was ever committed.' Baber ended up having to pay her lawyer $25,000 to settle the issue. After the end of the Emperor's Club, Baber temporarily moved to the U.K. where she got two university degrees from the University of Sussex and Middlesex University. She also received a degree from NYU. While the end of the Emperors Club turned out to be a good thing for Baber in that she was finally able to go back to school, it was more traumatic for Spitzer. After the revelation that he slept with an Emperors Club escort named Ashley Dupre, Spitzer resigned and he was unsuccessful when he tried to salvage his career by running in New York City's comptroller race this year - losing out to Scott Stringer. Looking back on the prostitute part of her life, Baber says it helped her learn that men 'aren't pigs' and just like women, they 'need to be with someone who puts effort into maintaining all the things that attracted them in the first place.' 'It seems simple enough, but these things often go neglected by their wives and partners.'","Valerie Baber was one of several prostitutes who worked for the infamous New York escort service Emperors Club .

"From the outside,  elegant Belgrave Square appears exactly as it was when Thomas Cubitt first built its grand houses in the 1820s – exclusive, noble, expansive – and, famously the London home of the British aristocracy. But behind the opulent facades, a quiet social revolution has been taking place: most of the square’s grand mansions have now been bought by foreign multi-millionaires, including some whose wealth is so outrageously vast they are listed as billionaires. Using offshore companies to avoid scrutiny, and stamp duty, the international super-rich have been discreetly acquiring the capital’s trophy assets – making this, in the process, the richest residential square in the country. Expensive address: Most of Belgrave Square in London has now been bought by foreign multi-millionaires, including some whose wealth is so outrageously vast they are listed as billionaires . The buyers are typical of the brash new money flooding into London, which hosts 72 billionaires – ten per cent of the world’s total –not to mention a growing number of super-rich worth £100  million or more. And they are paying hugely inflated prices for houses, ranging from £7  million for a mere apartment up to an estimated £60  million – for ‘homes’ which in many cases are rarely occupied. Last week it was reported that London has become the millionaire capital of the world per head of population, ahead of New York and Tokyo, based on analysis by the New World Wealth consultancy. The owners of Belgrave Square symbolise this new wealth. The majority are resident but non-domiciled which means they do not have to pay tax on their overseas income.  For this privilege they pay an annual fee of £50,000 – petty cash for an oligarch or tycoon. Despite prices now at £3,000 per sq ft, London remains the most attractive place for the foreign rich to park their money and educate their children. And they reside in a tiny enclave of which Belgrave Square is the epicentre. Dominated by embassies and consulates, there are fewer than 30 homes, but at least five of the owners are billionaires. Only three are owned by Britons, and few are occupied full time. At night it has a ghostly feel.

In the UK, life expectancy for a boy born in 2012 is 79 and for a girl it is 83, meanwhile in the U.S. it is 76 and 81 respectively. But are your habits and lifestyle knocking years off your life? In . a bid to raise awareness about the risk factors for a premature death, . Canadian medical experts from various organisations - including the .

Project Big Life, it was created by a team investigating the deaths of 70,000 . people - and how different health behaviours affected the risk of death. It takes into account a person's height and weight, if they smoke (or . ever have) and how often alcohol is consumed. Fruit . and vegetable intake is also taken into account - in particular the . quantity of fruit juice, salad, fruit, salad, potatoes and carrots . consumed each week. Later questions relate to exercise; how many hours are spent a) jogging or running and b) playing ice hockey, soccer, basketball, volleyball, or rollerblading. Activities such a walking, cycling, gardening, golfing, bowling and fishing are calculated as leisure time. Finally, stress levels, health conditions (such as heart disease and diabetes) and household income are factored in. TAKE THE TEST HERE . While the health dangers of smoking are well known, research is increasingly showing . that being obese and/or sedentary may be just as bad. Last month, .

His father told Buckwild producers that his son 'died doing what he loved,' according to ABC News. Neighbor Swanna Frampton, who had known him since he was a small child, told the AP: 'Shain always rides with these kids in four-wheelers and trucks. They were just out riding and having a good time.' Frampton said Gandee 'loved to live and have fun. He was a great person. He did what [the show] wanted him to do, but he wasn't like that. He was a real person. If you needed help, if [you] needed something, he would come help you no matter what.'

MTV said the half-hour series in the old Jersey Shore time slot was pulling in about 3 million viewers per episode since its premiere and was the No. 1 original cable series on Thursday nights among 12- to 34-year-olds. Recently, two of Gandee's classmates have found themselves on the wrong side of the law. Last week, 24-year-old Salwa Amin was sent back to jail for violating the terms of her bond following a February arrest. She was charged with two counts of drug possession with intent to deliver and initially jailed on $200,000 bond. That was later reduced to $100,000, but Amin remained behind bars without bond Monday. State Police said a multi-agency task force arrested Amin and two other people at a Summersville residence after getting a tip from an informant. A search found oxycodone pills, heroin and $3,000 in cash. Another cast mate, Michael Douglas Burford, was charged in February with driving under the influence.

"A British student training to be a safari guide in South Africa died less than an hour after being bitten by a black mamba snake. Nathan Layton, 28, did not realise he had been bitten while helping to capture the reptile at the college where he and his girlfriend were studying. But within an hour, he complained of blurred vision, collapsed and suffered a cardiac arrest. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Couple: Nathan Layton and his girlfriend Laura Woolley. He was killed after a deadly snake was discovered in a corridor at the wildlife college where he and his girlfriend had embarked on a year long course . Mr Layton and his girlfriend Laura Woolley had left the UK in January 2008 to go on the year long course at the South African Wildlife College in Hoedspriut, pictured, in South Africa . The black mamba had been found near a . classroom at the Southern African Wildlife College in Hoedspruit and . put in a plastic box by a staff member using a catcher stick. Shortly afterwards, however, it . escaped as Mr Layton and an instructor transferred it to a glass jar so . it could be shown around the college. It was while helping to recapture . it that Mr Layton was bitten. Instructor Nellie De Kock said in a . statement to an inquest in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, yesterday that after . helping to put the snake in the jar, Mr Layton went to a class. Loss: Laura Woolley pictured at the inquest. She and her boyfriend wanted to be safari guides . He then approached her to ask if a . bite from a black mamba would bleed and she told him ‘no’. When she . asked if he had been bitten, he was not sure and showed her his right . index finger. She said she asked him if he was . aware of any tingling in his lips, arms and toes and he replied that he . wasn’t. ‘He said he did feel the snake brush against him,’ said Miss De . Kock.  ‘Thirty minutes into the lecture Nathan turned around and said . “my vision’s going blurry”. ‘I realised immediately that he had been bitten and it took just a few seconds after that for him to collapse.’ Attempts to help him with CPR failed, and he died with his girlfriend Laura Woolley at his side. Miss Woolley told the inquest Mr . Layton feared he had been bitten, but Miss De Kock ‘had told him there . was no visible bite mark so he was fine’. She said no black mamba anti-venom . was kept at the college and that the nearest supply was an hour away, . but if her boyfriend had been given some, he might have survived. ‘Action should have been taken but because we were new we listened to our trainer,’ she added. The couple left the UK in January . 2008 to go on a year-long course at the college and Mr Layton, of Wing, . Buckinghamshire, died on March 4. Coroner David Morris said the inquest had been delayed because South African authorities had not provided him with information. Recording a narrative verdict, he said Mr Layton ‘died from the effects of a black mamba snake bite’.","Nathan Layton, 28, suffered a heart attack within an hour of being bitten ."
"Clouds resembling tornadoes were spotted in the skies above Britain today as clouds darkened ahead of a bout of bad weather. Distinctive cyclones whirling in the skies could be seen over Lincolnshire today, heralding a weekend of powerful storms. Forecasters have issued severe weather warnings for most of the UK this Saturday, with heavy rain predicted alongside thunderstorms and 'intense' hail. Scroll down for video . Twister: Logistic manager Geoff Hill saw this tornado-like cloud in the skies over Lincolnshire this afternoon . One of the twisters above Lincolnshire was found today by logistics manager Geoff Hill, whose company is based near Market Rasen. Twisting cloud formations like those pictured only technically qualify as tornadoes if they make contact with the ground - those pictured are believed instead to be funnel clouds. Mr Hill managed to capture an image of the wild winds, which started to form around 3pm today. He said: 'It was spotted by one of our store staff working outside looking up at the sky. Somebody rushed in and said there’s a tornado. 'So we . went outside and I grabbed my camera and took a picture.

Later on the same day photographer Stuart Morant captured an array of other powerful winds to the north of Lincolsnhire, near Scunthorpe.

An official warning issued today said: 'The public should be aware of the potential for localised flooding due to the intensity of these storms, although at this stage the location of the heaviest rainfall is uncertain. 'Warm, humid air is likely to be pulled northwards from France late on Friday and during Saturday. 'Within this air mass, there is an increasing likelihood that heavy, thundery showers will break out... over the next few days it may be possible to focus on the areas most at risk.'

"George Osborne yesterday put ‘silver savers’ at the heart of the Tory campaign for next year’s  general election. As well as giving big tax breaks to the thrifty, his Budget heralded the most radical reform of pensions for a century. Workers nearing retirement will be allowed to transform their private pension pots into bank accounts. With no need to take out an annuity, pensioners will be free to spend their nest eggs as they like. The Chancellor’s move follows MoneyMail’s campaign to expose the dismal payouts that annuity providers offer. Scroll down for video . Chancellor George Osborne has announced big tax breaks to the thrifty and pension scheme overhauls . He also unveiled ‘pensioner bonds’ with generous rates for savers aged over 65, announced a £15,000-a-year ‘super ISA’ and abolished the 10p starting rate of tax on savings income. Other key measures include: . The ‘Blue Rinse Budget’ – staunchly Conservative and aimed squarely at the party’s traditional supporters – offered relief to those Mr Osborne said had ‘worked hard and saved hard all their lives and done the right thing’. It was a transparently political statement appealing to middle-aged and older voters who are much more likely to turn out in next year’s election and have been squeezed for years by record low interest rates. It was also calculated to bring older Tory voters who are flirting with UKIP back into the fold; almost two thirds of those who say they may vote for the anti-EU party are over 55. The centrepiece of the Budget was what the Chancellor described as the most far-reaching change to private pensions since 1921. It will remove the restriction on the amount of money the 13million people in defined contribution pension schemes can take out of their pension pot. They will no longer face a current ‘punitive’ 55 per cent tax rate – which prompts most people to buy an annuity – and will instead be taxed at normal marginal rates. The cash they withdraw can be used to invest in property, clear debts or spend – just like savings in a regular bank account. Cheers: Chancellor George Osborne announced automatic tax rises on alcoholic drinks will be axed to help bring some cheer to Britons struggling with the cost of living . The shock announcement wiped £4.5billion off the value of pension firms, which have been criticised for their opaque fees and poor value products. The Chancellor unveiled a further series of measures to show the Government has what has been dubbed ‘Essex appeal’. Pitched at the kind of blue collar voters who once backed Margaret Thatcher, they included a penny off a pint, a freeze on duty for spirits and cider, tax cuts for most long-haul holiday flights and a halving of tax on bingo. For those in work, Mr Osborne announced a further increase in the starting rate of income tax to £10,500 – meaning 24million basic rate taxpayers will be £800 a year better off by the time of the election. Childcare subsidies worth up to £2,000 a year per child will be given to dual-earner couples. The Chancellor shunned calls from Tory MPs for a significant hike in the threshold for the higher 40p rate paid by middle class professionals, pulling 400,000 more into the bracket. His fifth Budget was set against the biggest economic upgrade in 30 years. The independent Office of Budget Responsibility said the economy was on course to grow by 2.7 per cent in 2014 compared with the 1.8 per cent it forecast only a year ago. Though austerity measures would have to continue way beyond the next election, Mr Osborne said the economy was recovering faster than expected and it was time for people to start to be rewarded for holding their nerve. ‘The message from this Budget is: you have earned it; you have saved it; and this government is on your side. Whether you’re on a low or middle income, Whether you’re saving for your home, for your family or for your retirement. We’re backing a Britain that saves,’ the Chancellor told cheering Tory MPs. Mr Osborne said the ‘economy was continuing to recover and recovering faster than forecast’.But he cautioned that the job was far from done, adding: ‘Our country still borrows too much, we still don’t invest enough, export enough or save enough. This is a Budget for building a resilient economy. ‘If you are a maker, a doer or a saver, this budget is for you.’ Winnings: There will also be a 25 per cent tax grab on gambling machine profits . The huge budget deficit will be down ‘by a half’ in the coming year but remains ‘one of the highest in the world’. The Chancellor insisted the Government would balance the books within four years, running a surplus of around £5billion or 0.8 per cent by 2018-19 – years after this was originally planned. The Budget statement appeared to leave Ed Miliband floundering in the Commons, focusing his criticism of the Government on the cut in top rate of tax to 45p announced two years ago. The Labour leader offered little response to any of the measures announced by Mr Osborne, and shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said later that he did not immediately oppose any of them. The Shadow Chancellor did suggest that the Chancellor’s pension reforms could eventually lead to a big fall in tax receipts. He said they would initially generate extra revenues as more people took money out of pension pots, before becoming a cost to the Exchequer in the 2030s. Mr Balls said Mr Miliband had a ‘difficult’ time but suggested it was because he had been distracted during the Chancellor’s statement by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles falling asleep. Mr Pickles denied doing so, though he said it would have been a ‘blessed release’ to have slept through Mr Miliband’s ‘lacklustre’ response. Around £4billion was wiped off the value of the UK’s biggest pensions firms yesterday after the Chancellor announced radical reforms to give more choice to savers when they retire. George Osborne said savers would be allowed to draw money from their pension pots as they wish when they retire. But fears the overhaul will lead to a slump in sales of pension annuities spooked investors and triggered a rout on the stock markets. Last night consumer campaigners described it as a ‘wake-up call’ for insurance companies, which have been accused of making huge profits from selling poor-value pensions for many years. George Osborne said savers would be allowed to draw money from their pension pots as they wish when they retire. File picture . The share price of insurance giant Legal & General fell by more than 8 per cent, reducing its value by £1.1billion. Shares in Aviva, the UK’s biggest seller of annuities, fell by more than 5 per cent, equating to a drop of almost £800million. But the biggest casualties were Partnership and Just Retirement, which specialise in selling annuities to savers suffering ill health. Although they have been credited with providing a better deal than mainstream insurers, their share price plunged 55 per cent and 42 per cent respectively because they are so reliant on annuity sales. In total, around £4billion was wiped off the value of five of the biggest sellers of pensions annuities – Aviva, Legal & General, Prudential, Partnership and Phoenix. Pensions campaigner and former Downing Street adviser Dr Ros Altmann said: ‘This is a wake-up call. Insurers have brought this on themselves. ‘They will have to make sure annuities are good value?…?and will not be able to allow savers to roll over into poor-value pensions when they retire. The easy pickings they have had in the past will be few and far between.’ Legislation forcing savers to buy an annuity at the age of 75 has already been scrapped and experts believe the Chancellor’s reforms will make annuities much less appealing. Ben Cohen, of analysts Canaccord Genuity, said: ‘The reason why you see a massive reaction in the market is  investors think firms like Partnership will disappear. ‘I think there will still be a market for annuities. But it’s difficult to see how companies which don’t have another string to their bow will survive.’ Peter Hargreaves, of financial firm Hargreaves Landsown, said: ‘Insurance companies had a captive audience, meaning savers got a lousy deal and they made huge profits. These days are coming to an end.’ Otto Thoresen, of the Association of British Insurers, said the changes  were a ‘significant challenge for everyone involved in helping people secure their retirement income’.","Chancellor unveils budget aimed at grassroots Tory supporters .

"A Queensland man who was bitten by Australia's deadliest snake calmly reached for a cold beer and sat down to wait for an ambulance. Rod Sommerville, 54, was bitten on the finger by an eastern brown snake – the world’s second most venomous snake – while working in his garden in Yeppoon, Central Queensland. But it’s what happened next that would impress even the toughest survivalists. Mr Sommerville hit the snake over the head with his shovel and called himself an ambulance. He then grabbed a cold beer from the fridge and quietly waited for help to arrive, according to the New Zealand Herald. Deadly: the eastern brown is the second most venomous snake in the world, and is considered Australia's most dangerous snake . Mr Sommerville’s teenage son was asleep on the couch at the time, but slept through the entire ordeal because his dad didn’t want to bother him. 'If you panic, it makes it worse,' Mr Sommerville told the Rockhampton Morning Bulletin. 'I said to myself, if I'm going to cark it (die) I'm going to have a beer, so I got a Goldie (Australian beer XXXX Gold) out of the fridge and drank that.' Angry: Notorious for its aggressive nature and fast-acting poison, the eastern brown is responsible for more than 50 per cent of snake-bite deaths in Australia . Things didn’t get any easier for Mr Sommerville once help arrived, though. The father suffered an allergic reaction to the anti-venom and spent four days in intensive care. And while he’s now recovering, he’s yet to be discharged from hospital, more than three weeks after being bitten. “The reaction nearly killed me as well, so it was a double whammy,” he said. There are more than 3,000 reported snake bites in Australia each year, but less than five on average prove fatal. The eastern brown snake is notorious for both its potent venom and its aggressive nature. A 59-year-old Australian woman died in November last year after being bitten on the ankle by an eastern brown snake.","54 year old Queensland man bitten by an eastern brown snake .

"A transsexual who had a £10,000 sex change on the NHS to become a woman now wants the taxpayer to foot the bill for a further £14,000 of surgery so she can become a man again. Chelsea Attonley, 30, who was born a boy and called Matthew, said she now finds being a woman 'exhausting', is tired of putting on make-up and wearing heels, and now accepts that she should always have stayed a man. Chelsea said she had struggled with her identity while growing up in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, and as a child she would dress up in women's clothes. In her twenties she became a drag queen known as Miss Malibu, drawing on glamour model Katie Price's look for inspiration. Scroll down for video . Chelsea Attonley, 30, who was born a boy and called Matthew, had a £10,000 sex change on the NHS to become a woman. She now wants the taxpayer to foot the bill for a further £14,000 of surgery so she can become a man again . An initial bid for a sex change to become a woman was turned down by a doctor, sending Chelsea into a spiral of depression, she said. But then the former drag queen, who copied Jordan's style by wearing a blonde wig, mini skirts and stilettos, had a chance meeting with her idol in a nightclub in 2007. The glamour model told her to 'go for it' and her words inspired Chelsea to return to her GP and push once again for the gender reassignment surgery, costing £10,000. But now, seven years after surgery to become a woman, Chelsea wants to go back to being a man - and wants the taxpayer to foot the bill. Chelsea, who lives on welfare benefits, told a magazine yesterday she finds dressing and acting as a girl 'exhausting' and feels she has never been fully accepted as a real woman. She is aiming to have a breast reduction on the NHS and painful gender reassignment surgery to give her back a penis at a total cost of £14,000. Chelsea, who changed her name by deed poll from Matthew in 2008 after a £5,000 boob job in Thailand partly funded by benefit money, says she gradually began having doubts about the sex change . Chelsea, now living in London, said: 'I have always longed to be a woman, but no amount of surgery can give me an actual female body and I feel like I am living a lie. 'It is exhausting putting on make-up and wearing heels all the time. Even then I don't feel I look like a proper woman. 'I suffered from depression and anxiety as a result of the hormones too. 'I have realised it would be easier to stop fighting the way I look naturally and accept that I was born a man physically.' Chelsea, who spoke on ITV's This Morning earlier this year about Katie Price's encouragement, says she does not feel guilty about asking the taxpayer to pay for her reversion. 'Now I have decided I want to live as Matthew, I am desperate to have my FF-cup boobs removed,' she said. 'I can't afford to have them done privately, so I am hoping to have the op on the NHS. 'I can't work at the moment because I am too upset after what I have been through. 'I am considering having penis reconstruction too. I don't feel bad about the NHS paying for the surgery as I don't consider it a choice. 'I need to have these operations for the sake of my mental health. I am lucky enough to live in a country where there is free health care.' Chelsea, who changed her name by deed poll from Matthew in 2008 after a £5,000 boob job in Thailand partly funded by benefit money, says she gradually began having doubts about the sex change. She said: 'I thought the surgery would make me feel complete, but it didn't. 'I knew deep down that, even though I had had surgery, I had still been born a man. 'But I tried my best to block out my feelings.' Chelsea said living as a woman is exhausting. 'No matter how much make-up I put on or how I dressed, I knew people would not know me as a real woman. Chelsea, now living in London, said: 'I have always longed to be a woman, but no amount of surgery can give me an actual female body and I feel like I am living a lie' 'It was draining to constantly think about how to walk and speak like a girl. 'I was fighting a losing battle. When people found out about my past, they treated me like a liar and a fake. I suffered from anxiety and depression.' She said she lost the support of her mother when she died from a heart attack. She said : 'I could not keep up the act of pretending to be a woman any more. It was making me miserable. 'I had to go back to living as Matthew.' She said she had always struggled with her identity while growing up in Chesterfield, Derbyshire. As a child she would dress up in women's clothes, and in her twenties she became a drag queen known as Miss Malibu . Chelsea has already had testosterone injections to begin her transition to becoming a man again. She has also had testosterone injections to stimulate hair growth and has cut his hair. She added: 'If people criticise me for wanting treatment on the NHS, it does not bother me. 'I know I need these changes to make me happy and no one should deny me that.' The TaxPayers' Alliance yesterday insisted the NHS should not be expected to pay out again. Research director Alex Wild said: 'The NHS must prioritise crucial frontline services over ridiculous vanity operations. 'This whole saga has simply cost far too much. If the Health Service is to be properly funded, this sort of waste must be cut out.'","Chelsea Attonley, 30, was born a boy and called Matthew .

"Radical new option: Methotrexate treats rheumatoid arthritis, so it is thought it could help with osteoarthritis too . The usual drug treatments for osteoarthritis are anti-inflammatory painkillers, often topped up with cortisone injections. And for more than a year this is what Susan Dawson was given, but it made little difference. Susan, a school learning 'mentor' from Liversedge, West Yorks, has osteoarthritis in all her joints - it started in her elbows in 2007, but she quickly developed it in her shoulders, hips, fingers and knees and she could soon walk only with a stick. Then Susan, who is married with a son and daughter in their 30s, was prescribed a new drug in a six-month pilot study by Arthritis Research UK and the University of Leeds. After taking the drug for three months the swelling in her knees went down markedly and the pain reduced. She was also able to walk without the stick -  before and after scans and measurements of the knees showed a remarkable improvement in the inflammation. 'I couldn't believe it,' she says. 'The drug made a huge difference. I was very grateful, as I'd been in so much pain.' The drug Susan was given was methotrexate - a chemotherapy drug which is also licensed for treating rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune condition that affects around 400,000 people in the UK, causing inflammation of the joints. In rheumatoid arthritis, the drug helps to reduce the inflammation by reducing the activity of the immune system - around half of those with rheumatoid arthritis take methotrexate. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease where the cartilage, which cushions the joints, wears away. Both conditions can lead to inflammation - pain, swelling and stiffness - in the joints. The thinking behind the pilot study was that if methotrexate works in reducing inflammation, it would help osteoarthritis, too. Osteoarthritis is typically managed with weight loss and muscle-strengthening exercises (to help provide support for the joint). Current drug options include cortisone injections and anti-inflammatories. But patients often live with severe pain and have difficulty carrying out their normal day-to-day activities, says Philip Conaghan, professor of musculoskeletal medicine at the University of Leeds and lead researcher on the pilot study. 'There is an urgent need to find better ways of managing their pain,' he says. The pilot study suggested methotrexate could possibly answer that need. It found that 37 per cent of the 30 patients with knee osteoarthritis who took methotrexate had a significant (40 per cent) reduction in their pain (there was no placebo group as a comparison). About 10 per cent (four people) had increased pain. Osteoarthritis: A degenerative joint disease where the cartilage, which cushions the joints, wears away . The results also suggested that inflammation plays a role in the pain of osteoarthritis, something that hasn't been clear before. Before she joined the pilot study in 2009, Susan had been in excruciating pain. Just over a year earlier, she'd noticed her knees were clicking when she walked, then the right one gave way completely. 'I didn't hurt myself, but all I could think of was how I was going to manage on the Nile cruise my husband, Stephen, and I were set to go on a month later,' she says. Her GP prescribed anti-inflammatories and the knee improved enough for her to be able to hobble around without support - and take the cruise - but the following year her left knee gave way in the school playground. 'I was terrified it was going to keep happening and that I'd keep falling over,' says Susan. She was put on different anti-inflammatories and signed off work for three-and-a-half weeks. 'I couldn't walk at all and the pain was terrible,' she says. After seeing a number of specialists at her local hospital, Susan was referred to Chapel Allerton Hospital, where Professor Conaghan invited her to take part in the trial. 'The anti-inflammatories and cortisone injections just weren't working and I felt so bad I'd have turned to anything,' she says. Susan was prescribed eight 2.5mg tablets of methotrexate once a week, gradually increased to 6.5mg - this is the standard dose for rheumatoid arthritis. She also had to take folic acid to reduce the nausea and mouth ulcers that are sometimes associated with taking the drug. Then, three months after she'd started the treatment, Susan noticed a significant change - the swelling in her knees had gone down and she wasn't in so much pain. 'I felt so much better,' she says. She improved so much that when the trial finished Professor Conaghan gave permission for her to keep taking the drug. She was given three-monthly blood tests to check for possible major side-effects such as liver damage. As Professor Conaghan explains: 'Changes in liver function tests are seen in about 10 per cent of people taking methotrexate. 'These changes are reversible, but we routinely monitor the blood readings and reduce or stop the drug if we see any changes. Liver damage is extremely rare. 'One of the advantages of methotrexate is that we know there are a large number of people being treated for rheumatoid arthritis who have been able to stay on it for years.' This means doctors already know about the effects of  the drug's use, should it  become available to osteoarthritis patients. Most trials of osteoarthritis drugs, on the other hand, usually last only three months, says Professor Conaghan. Potential solution: 37% of patients with knee osteoarthritis who took methotrexate felt a significant reduction in pain . 'Yet most people have the disease for 20 to 30 years,' he says. 'Taken over long periods, anti-inflammatory drugs such as diclofenac and ibuprofen can have serious side-effects such as heart attack, stroke and stomach bleeds, which is why they are prescribed only in the lowest doses for the shortest amount of time. They are not very practical for chronic conditions.' Early next year Arthritis Research UK and the University of Leeds will be carrying out a larger clinical trial to test the effectiveness of methotrexate compared with a placebo. Professor Alan Silman, medical director of Arthritis Research UK, which is funding the research, said: 'Many people with osteoarthritis complain their joints are swollen and tender, suggesting there is inflammation which is damaging the joint. 'Stopping that inflammation early could halt the continuing damage many patients suffer.' Meanwhile, Susan, who is no longer on the drug, has had no more flare-ups of her osteo-arthritis and any pain is manageable with ibuprofen. However, she is careful and avoids doing too much or walking long distances. Her biggest bugbear is not being able to wear high heels any more as they puts pressure on her knees. 'But that's a small price to pay for being able to get around,' she says.

"Mehdi Benatia has just joined Bayern Munich for £21million - but Blackpool once rejected the chance to sign him for £100,000! Former manager Ian Holloway travelled to France five years ago to scout the central defender, who was playing for Clermont Foot and available for a relative pittance. But chairman Karl Oyston, known for his parsimonious attitude to running the Seasiders, wouldn’t stump up the cash. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Mehdi Benatia's new boss attack Thomas Muller in training . What a difference: Mehdi Benatia (centre) has joined Bayern Munich for £21m, five years after Blackpool rejected the chance to sign the Morocco centre half for just £100,000 . Parsimonious: Blackpool chairman Karl Oyston . Benatia was already a full Morocco international when Blackpool pulled the plug and subsequently joined Serie A side Udinese in 2010 on a free transfer. From there the 27-year-old centre half’s career really took off and last July joined Roma for £10m. Benatia had been heavily linked with Manchester United and Manchester City this summer before his switch to Bayern. It does present quite the turnaround for the player, who also failed to earn a move to Freiburg after an unsuccessful trial around the same time Holloway was interested. This heaps more embarrassment on those at Bloomfield Road, with the current incumbent Jose Riga still at loggerheads with the club’s hierarchy over the arrival of new players. They had just eight senior professionals in the middle of July and – despite a raft of signings on the cheap – still look threadbare. The only main target Riga has been allowed to land, Costa Rican Jose Miguel Cubero, is still struggling to obtain a work permit. Riga has seen his side lose all five competitive fixtures so far this campaign and is visibly frustrated at the lack of movement in the transfer market – despite the window shutting on Monday.

"Ecstatic crowds cheered the Queen's carriage procession through the streets of London today as Camilla was given pride of place next to Her Majesty in a very public display of how Prince Charles' wife is now part of the Firm.

Her husband, Prince Philip, has been watching the events unfold on the television . Camilla's prominence in today's procession is in stark contrast to a decade ago, when she sat distanced from Prince Charles and the senior royals to watch the show marking the Golden Jubilee. Prince Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles . married on April 9, 2005, in a civil ceremony at the Guildhall in . Windsor after their controversial relationship spanning several decades. As a divorcee, previously married to Andrew Parker Bowles, Camilla was . disliked by the public and the Royal family as the woman suspected of diverting Charles’s . affections from Diana. But after his divorce, Charles made it clear that his relationship with . Camilla was ‘non-negotiable’ and slowly brought her into the royal . circle through a series of carefully organised public appearances.

However, it was still viewed as a dramatic gesture signalling an end to years of bitterness, between herself and the Queen. For Camilla - whose name the Queen once refused to have mentioned in her presence - the invitation to a televised event was something of a breakthrough and friends at the time said she was 'extremely nervous' at her first step into the limelight. The apparent ending of any lingering family opposition to her was also hastened by the death of the Queen Mother on March 30 2002. Recently, she has provided valuable support to the new Duchess of . Cambridge, who has turned to her for advice on entering royal life. Camilla was spotted at a London hotel last year advising the then Kate Middleton on her upcoming wedding to Prince William.

"David Cameron last night warned that Britain is in a ‘war’ with the EU after European leaders railroaded through the appointment of arch-federalist Jean-Claude Juncker. In some of the strongest remarks by a British prime minister in Brussels, he condemned the ‘backroom deal’ and warned it could see Britain pushed towards the exit door. He warned counterparts they were making a ‘profound mistake’ by choosing Mr Juncker as the next president of the European Commission. Scroll down for video . An agitated David Cameron admitted he had lost 'the battle' to stop Jean-Claude Juncker becoming Commission president but claimed he would 'win the war' to reform the EU . Mr . Cameron lost the vote against appointing Mr Juncker by 26 countries to . two. Only Hungary joined the UK in opposing the former Luxembourg . premier . German media ridiculed both the PM and the English football team by mockingly comparing David Cameron and Wayne Rooney, saying of them both: 'He lines up, he loses, he goes home' European Council President Herman Van Rompuy, who represents national leaders in the EU, announced the decision to make Jean-Claude Juncker the European Commission president on Twitter. The head of the Commission is the most powerful job in Brussels . The Prime Minister was furious with the decision to ignore Britain. He said other EU leaders 'could live to regret' the move . The former Luxembourg Prime Minister said he was 'proud and honoured' to be nominated for Brussels top job by the European Council . Former Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker (right) was European People's Party's nominee to be Commission president. The party is the largest bloc in the European Parliament. David Cameron pulled the Tories out of the group whose because of it is too federalist, infuriating German Chancellor Angela Merkel (left) The appointment was approved by EU leaders . over a lunch of gazpacho, turbot with chervil and baby vegetables, and . chocolate and apricot millefeuille. Mr Cameron forced the issue to a . vote but ended up in a minority of two to 26 – with only Hungary backing . Britain in opposing the ex-Luxembourg leader’s appointment. German . media wasted no time in using Mr Cameron’s defeat to ridicule both him . and the England football team. Newspaper Bild said he ‘is becoming more . and more the Wayne Rooney of EU politics: he lines up, he loses, he goes . home’. The Prime Minister said support for the EU in Britain was . already ‘wafer thin’ and would be further undermined by Mr Juncker’s . coronation ahead of the in/out referendum the Tories have pledged to . hold in 2017 if re-elected. He condemned the EU’s new boss as ‘the . career insider of Brussels’ , saying he represented ‘a big step . backwards’. Mr Cameron, who says he wants Britain to remain in a . reformed EU, added: ‘If you want change, is that the type of person you . want for the future?’ He warned that Britain faced a ‘long campaign’ to claw back powers from Brussels, saying: ‘Frankly, sometimes you have . to be ready to lose a battle in order to win a war.’ Mr Cameron . added: ‘There are times when it’s very important that you stick to your . principles ... even if the odds are heavily stacked against you rather . than go along with something that you believe is profoundly wrong.’ He said the recent European elections had shown that there was ‘huge disquiet about the way the European Union works’. EU . leaders agreed to meet again in Brussels next month to carve up more . top jobs – a prospect Mr Cameron sarcastically described as ‘another day . in paradise’. He said that despite his anger, he accepted the outcome . and would try to work with Mr Juncker. The PM chatted with Lithuania's President Dalia Grybauskaite (left) and Denmark's Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt (right) in Brussels today . Mr Cameron warned there would be 'consequences' of ignoring Britain's objections to Mr Juncker and appointing him anyway . Mr Juncker is seen as an 'arch federalist' by the Government because of his record of wanting more power for Brussels over national Parliaments . The veteran European fixer was the candidate of the largest bloc within the European Parliament - the EPP centre right group which the Tories were members of until Mr Cameron withdrew after becoming Conservative leader . However, some British . officials privately believe Mr Juncker’s presidency could easily turn . into a disaster. This could see him step down before the end of his . five-year term, which is likely to be dominated by the threat of a . British exit from the EU. Mr Cameron found himself humiliatingly . isolated after being double-crossed by Germany’s Angela Merkel, who . initially told him she wanted to block Mr Juncker. It is the first time a . big EU job been filled without the agreement of one of the large member . states. Mr Cameron complained Mr Juncker’s entire career has been . founded on grabbing more powers for Brussels and away from nation . states. The new president’s alleged heavy drinking  has also been . discussed over recent weeks by worried leaders, according to one . European diplomat. He was spotted waiting for the announcement of his . victory in a Brussels bar. Mr Cameron, attending a memorial service in Ypres yesterday, has clashed with his ally Angela Merkel over the appointment of Mr Juncker . The German Chancellor is said to have privately admitted she had reservations about the former Luxembourg Prime Minister . Mrs Merkel was attacked in Germany for appearing to backtrack in her support for Mr Juncker, forcing her to eventually publicly support his appointment . Finnish prime minister Alexander Stubb said people in Britain who want to leave the EU should ‘wake up and smell the coffee’. He added: ‘The EU is a very good thing for the UK. Over 50 per cent of the trade of the UK goes to  the EU.’ Hungarian . prime minister Viktor Orban, the only other leader to vote with Mr . Cameron against Mr Juncker, said he did so as ‘a matter of principle’, . adding: ‘It is against Hungary’s interest that things should progress in . this direction.’ Labour had backed Mr Cameron’s stance in opposing . Mr Juncker. But  leader Ed Miliband seized on the outcome as ‘an utter . humiliation’. He said: ‘Instead of building alliances in Europe, David Cameron burns our alliances. And it is Britain that loses out.’ Eurosceptic Tories seized on Mr Juncker’s appointment as evidence the EU is unlikely ever to embrace fundamental reform. Former . minister John Redwood said: ‘This episode has reminded all in the UK . that the EU is not “coming our way”.’ He added: ‘The battle over Mr . Juncker was but the first skirmish in a long negotiation of a new . relationship for the UK with the rest of the EU.’ Tory MP John Baron . said: ‘The Prime Minister’s attempt to stop Juncker has been laudable. The peoples of Europe have made it clear that they want an EU which is . less bureaucratic, less interfering and less bossy.’","Luxembourger nominated by EU leaders to be next Commission president .

Held at the event in Indianapolis, Indiana, the stunt was aiming to raise money and awareness about dogs up for adoption. The kissing booth at Indiana State Fair was operated by dogs and organised by Helping Paws . The adorable mutts were lending their lips to a good cause at the charity booth - all captured on camera and turned into an amusing slow-motion video. The footage - compiled by students at Ball State University - shows is great detail the dogs slobbering over guests - who seem to delight in the affection. The canine booth was completely staffed by dogs and as the video shows, both the kissers and the people receiving the kisses had a ball. The booth was set up by animal adoption advocates Helping Paws who were there to raise awareness of shelter dogs available for adoption.

"Something is happening in W12. It's been happening for quite some time, but Shey Boo (the area formerly known as Shepherds Bush) is suddenly chic. The opening of Westfield White City in 2008 heralded a new era for the once shabby area of west London as a shopping destination. And with a Hummingbird Bakery, Soho House opening up a private members club, and famous faces including actress Carey Mulligan and her Mumford and Sons' star husband Marcus Mumford, singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor, Michael Gambon and Prince Harry's on-off girlfriend Cressida Bonus taking up residence, Shepherd's Bush's transformation is almost complete. New Shepherd's Bush: 'Shey Boo' is undergoing a makeover as affluent Londoners move in . Sleek: The Dorsett Shepherd's Bush is part of the changing face of the area, opening this month . Bordering Holland Park and Kensington, the area is now welcoming a host of affluent Londoners driven out by rising real estate prices. Late last year a shiny  hotel, Dorsett Shepherd's Bush opened, welcoming perhaps a slightly less hip crowd than those Soho House, but just as savvy to the area's new status. The four-star hotel is housed within a Grade II listed building, originally known as The Shepherd's Bush Pavilion and formerly a cinema, built in 1923. It launched with a glittering opening party that featured Chinese drummers, aerial artists serving champagne and terracotta warriors. Revamp: The four-star hotel is housed within a Grade II listed building,  formerly a cinema . Comfort: The hotel boasts contemporary rooms with chic touches, while remaining reasonable on the wallet . The  Dorsett boasts contemporary rooms with chic touches, while remaining reasonable on the wallet. The suites are spacious and well appointed, with many enjoying splendid views across the neighbouring Green. Do be aware when booking though that a handful of suites overlook the atrium or have no view at all - make sure to ask at check-in. The Spa on the fifth floor is great for a post-meeting massage, but with no pool or Jacuzzi, it is more about the individual treatments than luxurious ladies day at the spa. The space has been utilised well for the type of guests the hotel is likely to attract. Regeneration: Shepherd's Bush Market is also undergoing a £150million makeover . Where The Dorsett excels is catering to its business travellers. Modern, comfortable rooms that provide all the mod-cons they could need, a sleek bar and meeting space in the impressive atrium, and all a short tube ride from central London. Around the corner from the hotel, Shepherd's Bush Market is also undergoing a £150million makeover. Designed by Robin Partington & Partners and with works carried out by  Excel Demolition & Groundworks, the market will reopen early next year as a 'transitional' Box Park style market space. As in Shoreditch, the market will house shipping containers for traders to operate from until the main market is completed. Change: The market will reopen early next year as a 'transitional' Box Park style market space . Urban: Similar to the market in Shoreditch, traders will operate from shipping containers at the pop-up market . The regeneration is to include 212 new apartments including townhouses, flats and mews houses, as well as new shops and restaurants within the market and along Goldhawk Road. A spokesperson for Shepherd's Bush Market told MailOnline, ‘Shepherd’s Bush Market is changing…with the imminent regeneration scheme which will represent a £150m investment in the market and the wider area. 'This investment will secure a vibrant future for the market and lay the foundations for the area in the long term. The regeneration of this area will create new homes, new opportunities for start-up businesses, and revitalize this special and much loved London market. New era: The opening of Westfield in 2008 heralded Shepherd's Bush as a shopping destination . Meanwhile, the BBC Television Centre is to be converted into a mixed-use development. As well as the BBC studio and a 'media hub', the site will be transformed into a leisure and entertainment venue.

"A men's college basketball team flying high on the wings of victory after a close win had a huge scare when its plane was forced to make an emergency landing due to engine failure. The Mississippi State Bulldogs's chartered Embraer 145 twin engine jet made an emergency landing in St. Louis, Missouri, yesterday after it lost power in its right engine 20 minutes after takeoff. The plane departed from Columbia, Missouri, after the Bulldogs beat the Missouri Tigers 77-74. Scroll down for video . The right engine of the team's chartered twin engine jet (pictured) failed 20 minutes after it took off yesterday . Mississippi State head coach Rick Ray and the players on his team were leaving after the Bulldogs beat the Missouri Tigers 77-74 in Columbia, Missouri . Coach Ray provided updates about the status of the team on Twitter. They will head back to campus today . Mississippi State coach Rick Ray posted on Twitter that he heard a loud noise from the plane before the flight attendant announced it had 'lost an engine' and needed to land. Ray then wrote: 'Oh, that's all? Landed safely.' Bulldogs team spokesman Gregg Ellis said the plane 'veered to the left and then went dark for a moment before settling' and that 'everyone aboard was shaken up a bit', ESPN reported. After landing, the team tried to secure another plane but was unable to do so because strong winds prevented the replacement aircraft from leaving Kentucky. The team spent the night at a hotel in Festus, Missouri, because rooms in St. Louis were at a premium due to Mardi Gras festivities. Ellis, who provided numerous updates about the situation on social media, tweeted the team will take the bus back to campus in Starkville today. This is not the first time the program has had a close call. During the 2008 Southeastern Conference tournament in Atlanta, the roof of the Georgia Dome was ripped open by a powerful storm toward the end of the Bulldogs' game against Alabama. Mississippi State improved to 12-13 overall and 5-7 in conference play with the win against Missouri. The Bulldogs' next game is Thursday against rival Mississippi.

"Duncan Schwier leaving Hammersmith Magistrates Court today. He pleaded guilty to stealing £643,000 from music label Universal . A record label executive today admitted stealing almost £650,000 from Universal Music - home to U2 and Prince. Duncan Schwier, 52, swindled the world’s largest musical corporation with false invoices for more than a decade, Hammersmith Magistrates Court heard. He said a 'series' of cancers were the 'background' for his crimes. The con only came to light when Schwier was promoted and his successor raised the alarm after noticing scores of invoices paid to non-existent companies. Schwier of Twickenham, west London,  remained calm as he entered his guilty plea, telling the court: 'The background for this is a series of cancers for which I have medical reports.' Prosecutor Caroline Mungal said: 'The Crown invite the court to commit this matter for sentence. 'You can see the value of the monies involved, in excess of £600,000. 'The date range is long, the range of the offending. 'What has happened in this situation is that Mr Schwier was employed by Universal Music as head of production.' Miss Mungal said Schwier had worked with Universal since 1984. 'He was promoted in early 2013. Mr Schwier moved and his replacement was a person by the name of John Clifford. ‘He noticed there was something strange about some of the transactions. 'It was discovered that in fact there were a large number for fraudulent transactions.' The fraud amounted to £643.697.35, the court was told. Fraud: The con only came to light when Schwier was promoted and his successor raised the alarm after noticing scores of invoices paid to non-existent companies . Chair of the bench, Paul Brooks told Schwier: 'Although you have pleaded guilty to this offence, the amount of money and the period over which this fraud took place means this is too serious for this court to deal with.' Schwier admitted one charge of theft by employee. He was released on unconditional bail ahead of sentence at Isleworth Crown Court on 30 September.","Duncan Schwier, 53, sent false invoices to music giant for over a decade .

"Television fans now face paying bills of more than £100 if they want access to live sport and the latest hit shows. The rise of production costs and increasing competition between web-streaming services mean many pay for multiple television packages bundled with their broadband and phone lines. On-demand services like Netflix offer viewers more choice than ever before as well as exclusive programming - but at a hefty price. Watching popular shows like Game of Thrones, Orange is the New Black and former BBC drama Ripper Street as well as every Premier League match would require a subscription to Sky Atlantic, Netflix, Amazon Prime Instant Video and Sky Sports. Rising cost: To watch hit shows like Games of Thrones, left, and Orange is the New Black, right, viewers would need a subscription to Sky and Netflix respectively . The Guardian reported that if those services are bought directly, it would cost around £792 a year or £839 in HD - on top of a £145.50 TV licence. But Sky, Virgin Media and TalkTalk's top packages, which include all the best shows and broadband, now all cost more than £1,000 a year. The phenomenal success of event television programmes like Breaking Bad - which was put on Netflix for UK viewers immediately after airing across the Atlantic and Kevin Spacey's House of Cards - mean on-demand services have begun producing their own programming not available elsewhere. The choice of services has exploded within the last few years, with options range from Sky's Now TV service for those who do not want a Sky TV contract or using YouView with a BT or TalkTalk contract to access channels and on-demand shows without a satellite. Sky Sports subscribers can watch every single Barclays Premier League match - but it comes at a hefty cost . Event programming like Netflix's House of Cards starring Kevin Spacey have made Netflix more popular . But viewers who find themselves paying more should consider bundling their services – buying broadband, telephone and TV together – to save money and simplify bills. An Ofcom spokesperson said many viewers had experienced 'real-term price increases for certain packages'. Recent figures show BT's overall average revenue per user has grown 7% year on year to £404 a year. Sky's has gone up from £504 in 2010 to £574 this year and Virgin's is £588 a year – up 2% year on year. Sky's Complete Bundle comes with all the channels plus Sky Movies HD and Sky Sports HD, but it costs £71.25 a month (half price for the first six months). Virgin is offering Netflix free for six months and including BT Sport in packages that start from £20 a month. Netflix alone costs £5.99 a month. The best value Amazon Prime Instant Video plan includes one-day delivery of millions of items at £79 a year.","To watch Game of Thrones, Orange is the New Black and Premier League football matches, you need subscription to different services .

"The BBC is no longer the 'bastion' of correct English on radio and television, one of its editors has admitted. Thousands of viewers and listeners now complain to the corporation every year saying its once-high standards of grammar and pronunciation have slipped. Ian Jolly, who is the BBC newsroom's 'style editor', conceded his presenters and reporters repeatedly make basic errors, such as confusing the word 'historic' with 'historical' and using the term 'chair' when they mean 'chairman' or 'chairwoman'. Ian Jolly, who is the BBC newsroom's 'style editor', conceded his presenters and reporters repeatedly make basic errors, such as confusing the word 'historic' with 'historical' Following recent criticisms that presenters are also mispronouncing the letter 'H', he called on the BBC's senior management to prioritise efforts to make the corporation a linguistic 'standard bearer' once more. Appearing on Radio 4's Feedback, he said: 'There are thousands of people who get in touch with us every year because of our output on radio and television and on the internet. So they do care. 'And the thing that people often point out is that they look to the BBC to uphold standards. So I do think that we used to be a standard bearer in these matters. 'Whether that’s the case now I’m not so sure. I would love to see someone at the top of the BBC take up the challenge and put the emphasis back on the quality of our language so we can once again be a leader for the people who look to us. 'They think the BBC is the bastion and I would like to see us back at that position.' Mr Jolly was asked to respond to a string of complaints received in the past week by Feedback. One listener, Stuart Grist, contacted the programme to complain about BBC reports into the resignations of Fiona Woolf and Baroness Butler-Sloss from the Government's sex abuse inquiry. He said: 'The other day it was reported that the child abuse enquiry had lost two chairs. Today we were told that two chairs had stepped down. Whatever next, ""chairs found legless""? Or worse, ""two chairs table motions""?' Following recent criticisms that presenters are also mispronouncing the letter 'H', he called on the BBC's senior management to prioritise efforts to make the corporation a linguistic 'standard bearer' once more . Mr Jolly agreed it was incorrect to describe somebody as a 'chair' rather than a 'chairman' or 'chairwoman'. He added: 'I think it’s one of the side effects of what we like to call political correctness. But I don’t really see the need for it and we don’t advocate using it. We think if a man’s a chairman, he’s a chairman. A woman’s a chairwoman. 'If you know the gender of a person then there are quite good options there.' Another listener complained about the repeated confusion of the word 'historic', which should be used to describe an important event, and 'historical', which simply means an event took place in the past. He said newspapers, police forces and even the judiciary have also made the same error, adding: 'So it is one of those phrases that has seeped into our consciousness. We never used to use it and now we are not sure which it should be and tend to get it wrong. ' Mr Jolly said he 'occasionally' tells off presenters for making grammatical mistakes, but said listeners and viewers should be more understanding of errors that creep into live broadcasts. He said: 'The BBC produces hundreds of hours of broadcasting every day, much of it live. Not every word is perfect. We would be concerned if writers were getting things wrong. 'I think we have to allow staff a little bit of leeway in the live broadcasting that makes up so much of our output.' Last month, the BBC was criticised by the Queen's English Society for allowing presenters including Sara Cox and Radio 1 DJ Nick Grimshaw to say 'haitch' instead of 'aitch' when referring to the letter 'H'. It said such mistakes marked the beginning of a 'slippery slope', but the BBC said it was proud of the 'range of voices' across its programmes.","Thousands now complain to the corporation every year over grammar .

"It is the win they had dreamed of through 12 years of doggedly playing the same numbers every week. Gina Nolan and 11 colleagues in her work syndicate matched six numbers on the National Lottery last Saturday. The warehouse workers from Biggleswade, Bedfordshire, phoned lottery operator Camelot, which confirmed they were one of three ticketholders who would share the advertised £6.2million Lotto jackpot. Losing out: Gina Nolan (pictured centre) said, 'It has taken away the whole excitement of winning' Eleven of the syndicate were in line for £159,709 each while the 12th member, who paid double for their go, would get twice that amount. But two days later, Camelot told them there had been a mistake. Blaming ‘human error’, it said it had calculated the jackpot incorrectly – and in fact it would be nearly £1.5million less. Last night the five men and seven women accused Camelot of misleading them by failing to honour the advertised estimated jackpot. Instead they will receive £124,621 each. It is unwelcome news for Camelot, which on October 5 relaunched its Lotto draw and doubled ticket prices to £2 as part of a drive to reverse a decline in ticket sales. Mrs Nolan, 53, said: ‘It has taken away the whole excitement of winning. I cannot see how a big company could make such an error. I was more shocked than when we found out we had won.’ In the lead-up to Saturday’s draw Camelot had advertised the jackpot for its main Lotto draw as £6.2million. As broadcaster Chris Evans ‘released the balls’ on the live BBC1 draw on Saturday he told viewers: ‘£6.2million, here we go everyone.’ Releasing the balls on Saturday night, Chris Evans told viewers: '£6.2 million, here we go everyone' And on the official National Lottery Twitter page, it said: ‘You could fill the average bathtub 27 times over in £2 coins if you won tonight’s £6.2million Lotto jackpot!’ After the draw Mrs Nolan phoned Camelot which told her the syndicate’s ticket was one of three matching six numbers and would share the £6,228,639 jackpot. Her colleagues wept as they realised they would share a £2,076,213 portion of the jackpot. But later in the week Mrs Nolan was visited by Camelot officials who told her the jackpot had been miscalculated and was actually £4,860,213. ‘I went white as a ghost,’ said Mrs Nolan. ‘I know they say it is an estimated jackpot but after the draw they put up the £6.2million figure on their website – it is not estimated after the draw has taken place. She denied the group are greedy, saying: ‘We just want the prize they advertised.’ A Camelot spokesman confirmed that the Lotto jackpot had been ‘incorrectly communicated’. He said the error had been detected on Monday and the revised jackpot share of £1.62million paid out. He added: ‘The draw itself was conducted entirely in line with National Lottery game rules and procedures. We have apologised and are conducting a thorough review to prevent such a mistake happening again.’","Camelot confirmed Gina Nolan and 11 colleagues were one of three ticketholders and that they would share the advertised £6.2 million jackpot .

"The cheers back in Wales were drowned out by boos around Murrayfield as Warren Gatland’s side secured a controversial victory over Scotland to get their RBS 6 Nations back on track. Following a passionately fought contest, referee Glen Jackson found himself in the firing line after he blew the final whistle with time seemingly still running on the clock. Scotland skipper Greig Laidlaw was adamant that his team should have been given the chance to take one last kick-off and go for the win, following a try from Jon Welsh in the dying moments that narrowed the deficit to just three points.

Scotland winger Sean Lamont is brought down by Liam Williams as he tries to get forward . Scotland's Blair Cowan receives the loose ball as Alun Wyn Jones (left) and Sam Warburton (right) close him down for Wales . ‘From where I was sitting, there was time to take the kick,’ said Laidlaw. ‘Whether we would have gone on to score, that’s a different matter. The majority of the stadium seemed to feel the same.’ Ironically, Jackson used to play under Scotland coach Vern Cotter during his days as a fly-half for New Zealand side Bay of Plenty. But the Kiwi offered no favours to his former boss. ‘I’m sure others will look at the referee’s performance and decisions,’ said Cotter. ‘We will send something through that will help them (in their assessment).’ The dispute brought a sour end to a fierce contest, with the metronomic boot of Wales full back Leigh Halfpenny ultimately proving the difference after both sides scored two tries apiece. Following an anonymous performance against England in round one, emphasis in the Welsh camp had been on go-forward initiative. It took less than a minute for Jamie Roberts to make his first charge into the No 10 channel, but there was an over-eagerness as Jonathan Davies was turned over and Richard Hibbard mis-fired at the line-out. Wales dominated initial territory and possession, capitalising with a Halfpenny penalty, yet the tables were quickly turned. Wales' Dan Biggar comes crashing down after he is taken out in mid-air by Scotland's Finn Russell . Stuart Hogg breaks away to score the opening try for Scotland at Murrayfield . Wales' Alwyn Jones and Scotland's Ritchie Gray battle for the ball following a line-out . Alex Cuthbert was left isolated after a lateral run and he was turned over by fly-half Finn Russell. Richie Gray recycled, allowing Stuart Hogg to step on the gas and run under the posts from inside his own half. His try was converted by Laidlaw, who followed up with a penalty. Wales had been criticised for unnecessary kicking against England but they used the boot more effectively in the Scottish capital. The high-ball skills of Halfpenny, Dan Biggar and Liam Williams provided a dangerous attacking weapon and the trio challenged well for up-and-unders in Scottish territory. Rhys Webb was pulled down just short after a fine take by Halfpenny, who subsequently had the chance to narrow the deficit with a second penalty. Then Biggar was taken out in mid-air by his opposite number, Russell, and Wales took the sting out of Scotland’s momentum with a penalty while a yellow card came for the Scottish No 10. Wales launched a pivotal pitch-length counter-attack. Cuthbert made the initial surge, Williams kept the move going and sent Webb clear for his second try of the competition. Jonathan Davies joined Russell in the sin-bin for a second mid-air collision, but Gatland felt the initial incident was far more serious. ‘My initial reaction was the first one was red and the second one I am not sure,’ said the Wales coach.

Urged on by the home crowd, Scotland looked to seize the half-time initiative but Wales killed off a 13-man driving maul and, after some dazzling footwork, Hogg was denied a certain score following a tackle by the equally brilliant Halfpenny. With Russell returning to the fold shortly after the break, Laidlaw edged his side back with three points following an excellent turnover by Alex Dunbar on Roberts. The kickers exchanged further penalties, before Williams had a try ruled out just before the hour. Following a rare missed kick by Halfpenny, the Scottish defence was eventually breached. Gatland had kept faith in his Lions and, after his yellow card, Davies went some way to repaying that when he ran a fine line off Biggar. The centre evaded the attention of Matt Scott and stepped inside Hogg to pull his side clear. Scotland, meanwhile, failed to turn their pressure into points. Laidlaw turned down a kick at goal, while Mark Bennett had a late score chalked off for a forward pass. Welsh crashed over for the last-minute score and Russell eventually kicked the conversion, but Scotland were left to rue lost time.","Wales edged Scotland 26-23 at Murrayfield to recover from their opening game defeat to England in the Six Nations .

"A former councillor was trampled to death by a stampeding herd of cattle as he walked through a field in Derbyshire with his wife and two dogs. Peter Jakeman, 62, who was visiting the area from his home town in Callington, Cornwall, was walking across a field with his wife Hilary, 56, on the Okeover Estate in Ashbourne when the tragedy unfolded. Mr Jakeman, described as 'one of nature's gentlemen', was treated for blood loss and chest injuries after the stampede took place. Peter Jakeman, 62, from Callington, Cornwall, was walking across a field in Ashbourne, Derbyshire, when he was trampled to death by a herd of cows . He was then airlifted to the University Hospital of North Staffordshire by the Derbyshire, Leicestershire and Rutland air ambulance, but could not be saved. The Health and Safety executive has now launched an investigation into Mr Jakeman's death. Police say his death is not being treated as suspicious. A spokesman for the estate said they were 'horrified' by the 'terrible accident'. Mr Jakeman served on Callington Town Council from December 2004 to January 2006 and was also a chairman of the bench at Plymouth Magistrates’ Court. One neighbour told how retired Mr Jakeman and his wife had gone off with their trailer but were due to be back this Sunday. Councillor Jeremy Gist, who knew Mr Jakeman well, said: 'He wasn’t just a colleague, I regarded Peter and his wife as friends. 'He was a very active member of the community but not only that, he was a genuinely good man,what I would have called one of nature’s gentlemen. 'He was a talented man, if he did something you knew it would be done right. The incident took place on the Okeover Estate, the site of the Grade II listed Okeover Hall, pictured. A spokesman for the estate said they were 'horrified' by the 'terrible accident' 'There was no beating about the bush with Peter, if it was right it was right and if it wasn’t he would have told you. 'That was the sort of character that made him a good councillor.' Neighbour Terence Buckler said: 'They were the archetypal retired couple who loved to keep fit. 'Peter would spend hours in his front garden which they had recently done up. 'They . loved their dogs and we'd often see them walking with them. They had . gone off with their dogs and their trailer which was fairly new. 'They . loved it as they could go to a campsite and leave the trailer while . they went off in their car. They were due to be back this Sunday, it's . very sad.' Mr Jakeman, who was walking in the field with his wife and two dogs at the time, was airlifted to hospital by the Derbyshire Leicestershire and Rutland air ambulance after suffering from blood loss and chest injuries . He was taken to the University Hospital of North Staffordshire but could not be saved . Neighbour Faye Mowle-Haimes said: 'I’m shocked. I know he used to walk a lot with his wife and he had dogs, cocker spaniels.' And Councillor Rich Lumley said: 'He had the interests of the town at heart and was very committed in the short time he was on the town council.' Sylvia Palmer said: 'He was a really lovely man. He loved the outdoors - him and Hilary would often go out on their bikes for long distances and days out, they were very active. 'I'm sure they were doing lots of walking and cycling while they were away as that's what they really enjoyed. I can't believe it - it's so tragic.' A spokesman for Staffordshire Police said: 'Emergency services were called to reports of an injured man in a field off the A52 Leek Road in Upper Mayfield at around 9.05am on Wednesday May 14. 'It was reported the man had been injured by stampeding cows within the field. Mr Jakeman was a magistrate at Plymouth Magistrates' Court and also served as a councillor on Callington Town Council between 2004 and 2006 . 'He was taken to the University Hospital of North Staffordshire but sadly died in hospital later that morning. 'The death is not being treated as suspicious and inquiries are being over seen by the Health and Safety Executive.' Advice has now been issued to ramblers and tourists in the wake of Mr Jakeman’s death. On average, one person per year is killed by cattle in the UK, with nearly 500 hurt in attacks by animals from 2005 to 2013. It is thought attacks usually take place due to dogs being present or calves being in the field when walkers approach. The British Mountaineering Council said dogs should be kept on a lead and, if cattle appear unsettled, walkers should move away as carefully and quietly as possible. A spokesman said if people feel threatened they should let go of their dog’s lead - if they are holding one - and try not to make any noise or fast movements. A statement from the estate said: 'We are horrified by this terrible accident and our thoughts and prayers are with the family of Peter Jakeman.'","Peter Jakeman, 62, was visiting the area when he was trampled by cows .

"Former Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari was accused of unprofessional conduct on Saturday after he abandoned his Gremio side before the end of their 1-0 home defeat by lowly Veranopolis. An angry Felipao, as he is known in Brazil, left the dugout and walked to the dressing room with four minutes still left in the game. 'I sent myself off,' he told reporters after Gremio's third defeat in four matches. Gremio boss Luiz Felipe Scolari was criticised for walking out on his team as they lost 1-0 to Veranopolis . 'It's impossible to be more embarrassed than that,' said the man at the helm when Brazil lost 7-1 to Germany in the World Cup semi-finals last year. 'There was nothing more I could do so I went to the dressing room. There were three or four minutes left so I wanted to cool down and make sure I didn't do something I shouldn't.' However, pundits rounded on the former Chelsea boss for not sticking by his team. 'Imagine if he did that at the Mineirao (stadium) in the 7-1 against Germany,' former Brazil captain Carlos Alberto Torres said on Sportv. 'Would he have the guts to do that and walk out on the Brazil team?' Another ex-Brazil defender, Ricardo Rocha, said that even though Gremio lost some key players in the close season, Scolari should have remained loyal to his team and worked to get them back in the game. 'He knew the problems Gremio were facing, he's spoken about them,' Ricardo Rocha said. 'And he abandoned ship. He should have stayed with the players till the end.' Gremio have lost three of their last four games and clearly the pressure is starting to get to Scolari . Scolari was in charge of the Brazil side that lost 7-1 to Germany at the World Cup last year .","Luiz Felipe Scolari has been criticised for abandoning his Gremio side .

"Championship clubs spent over £14million on agents fees last season, with play-off winners Queens Park Rangers topping the bill. Harry Redknapp's side paid over £1.8million to players' representatives in the 2013/14, on their way to reaching the Premier League thanks to a Bobby Zamora goal at Wembley. Unsurprisingly three of the league's four lowest spenders were relegated, with only cash-strapped Blackpool (£10,000) paying agents less than Yoevil Town (£61,550), Doncaster Rovers (131,380) and Barnsley (£221,445). Well worth it: QPR may have spent a lot of money on agents but it paid off when they won the play-off final . In the money: Bobby Zamora's strike at Wembley ensured Rangers more than made their money back . However Leicester City and Burnley showed that big spending is not always needed to get results, between them paying out under £700,000 and finishing first and second respectively. The other sides to splash the cash were Blakcburn Rovers (£1,681,080), Wigan Athletic (£1,460,460) and Reading (£1,656,446). Between them the four biggest spenders account for 45 per cent of the Championship's total output to agents. Expenses: Charlie Austin, signed from Burnley, was one of 11 players brought in last season . Costly: Blackburn Rovers were the second highest spenders, DJ Campbell one of their 13 signings . In total the Football League spent 18 per cent less last season than the previous year, but agents still raked in an average of over £32,000 per transfer in the Championship. According to the Football League's Chief Executive, Shaun Harvey, the reduction was a result of the league's new Financial Fair Play regulations. However, he stressed that the more than £17million spent on agents was still 'a very significant sum leaving the game'. Who needs money: Leicester City won last season's Championship despite just £343,900 on agents' fees . 'The 2013/14 campaign was the first season against which sanctions will be applied in all three of our divisions under The Football League's Financial Fair Play rules. It is therefore notable that we have seen a significant fall in payments to agents. 'Hopefully this is a sign that they are having a positive effect but it's too early to know for definite at this stage. 'Whilst a reduction of £4m is welcome there is still a very significant sum leaving the game to pay agents.'

"Many car manufacturers and phone makers rave about the smart systems in cars that are designed to help drivers safely use their devices at the wheel. But in a study, researchers found that such systems were actually dangerous, as drivers were distracted by misunderstood requests or poor service. On a scale of one to five, five being most distracting, Apple's Siri rated the worst at 4.14 while others such as Chevrolet's MyLink also ranked highly at 3.7. Two studies were carried out by the AAA foundation for Traffic Safety in Washington DC and the University of Utah. They found that drivers were increasingly distracted by 'smart' cars. This photo shows a driver during the Cognitive Distraction Phase II testing in Salt Lake City . Two studies were carried out by the AAA foundation for Traffic Safety in Washington DC, and the University of Utah. In one, they examined infotainment systems in some of the most common brands on the road, including Chevrolet, Chrysler, Ford, Hyundai, Mercedes and Toyota. The other used Apple's Siri voice system to navigate, send texts, make social media posts and use the calendar without handling or looking at the phone. 1.7 - Toyota's Entune . 2.2 - Hyundai's Blue Link . 2.7 - Chrysler's UConnect . 3.0 - Ford Sync with MyFord Touch . 3.1 - Mercedes' COMAND . 3.7 - Chevrolet's MyLink . 4.14 - Apple's Siri . The systems were tested by 162 university students and other volunteers in three settings - a laboratory, a driving simulator, and in cars while driving though a Salt Lake City neighbourhood. The voice-activated systems were graded on a distraction scale of 1 to 5, with 1 representing no distraction and 5 comparable to doing complex math problems and word memorisation. Apple's Siri received the worst rating of 4.14. And test drivers using Siri in a driving simulator rear-ended another car on two separate occasions. Chevrolet's MyLink received the worst rating, 3.7, among the infotainment systems. Infotainment systems from three other automakers - Mercedes, Ford and Chrysler - were also rated more distracting for drivers than simply talking on a mobile. Two of the infotainment systems were rated relatively low for distraction. Toyota's Entune received a 1.7, the distraction equivalent of listening to an audiobook, and Hyundai's Blue Link Telematic System received a 2.2. During research, 162 students drove in simulators and around a neighbourhood while using different voice-activated integration systems. Many of the test subjects found that the systems were unable to understand their requests. Apple's Siri (stock image shown) was rated the most distracting . The systems with the worst ratings were those that made errors even though drivers' voice commands were clear and distinct. Drivers had to concentrate on exactly what words they wanted to use, and in what order, to get the systems to follow their commands, creating a great deal of frustration. For example, an infotainment system might recognise a command to change a radio station to '103.5 FM' but not 'FM 103.5' or simply '103.5.' Siri also sometimes garbled text messages or selected wrong phone numbers from personal phonebooks. During one test, it called 911 instead of the phone number requested by the volunteer driver, and the driver had to scramble to end the call before it went through. Siri found the number in the driver's phonebook because the driver had called it once before. 'When these systems become more complex, like sending text messages or posting to Facebook, it pushes the workloads to pretty high levels and may be dangerous while driving,' said Professor David Strayer, the University of Utah psychology professor who led the two studies. The voice-activated systems (shown being tested) were graded on a distraction scale of 1 to 5, with 1 representing no distraction, and 5 comparable to doing complex math problems and word tasks. Chevrolet's MyLink received the worst rating, 3.7, among the infotainment systems . The studies contradict claims by car manufacturers, who have been pitching the voice systems to buyers as a way they can safely enjoy social media and connectivity. In April last year Texas researchers found that using voice commands to send text messages while driving - on software such as Apple's Siri - is just as dangerous as texting with fingers. They found that both methods impacted driver response times equally - but that it often took voice recognition users longer to fix mistakes with their messages. The findings were then confirmed by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety in the US in June. It similarly found that as mental workload and distractions increase, reaction times get slower and brain function is compromised. In the run up to the CarPlay release, Apple added Eyes-Free technology to its latest iOS software. The Siri Eyes-Free tool lets users control this the system by voice so they can keep their eyes on the road. Safety advocates claim drivers assume such systems are safe because they are incorporated into vehicles and are hands-free. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which regulates vehicle safety, has issued guidelines to automakers for dashboard systems and is working on similar guidelines for phone and voice-activated systems, but the guidelines are voluntary. 'Infotainment systems are unregulated,' said Deborah Hersman, president of the National Safety Council and former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board. 'It is like the wild west, where the most critical safety feature in the vehicle - the driver - is being treated like a guinea pig in human trials with new technologies.' 'The good news is that really well-designed systems offer us the possibility to interact in ways that aren't so distracting,' Professor Strayer said. 'What we continue to see from customers is that they demand this level of technology in their vehicles, that access to music and access to calls is now a critical part of the driving experience and so we're looking at innovative ways to provide that,' said Chevrolet spokeswoman Annalisa Bluhm. Apple noted in a statement that researchers didn't use the company's CarPlay or Siri Eyes Free, which are designed for use in cars. However, Professor Strayer said researchers consulted with Apple before beginning the study. The study used an iOS 7 version of Siri that was tweaked to be nearly identical to the iOS 8 version, which was just recently released, he said.

"Emile Heskey believes newly-appointed Aston Villa boss Tim Sherwood has a 'decent squad to work with' after taking over the reins at the Premier League strugglers. Sherwood was announced as the new manager of Aston Villa on Saturday just three days after Paul Lambert's dismissal from his role at Villa Park. Aston Villa are currently languishing in 18th spot in the Premier League, however Heskey believes Sherwood has enough quality at his disposal to steer his former side away from the relegation zone. Former Aston Villa striker Emile Heskey believes Tim Sherwood has a 'decent squad work with' Sherwood, pictured ahead of his new side's FA Cup tie against Leicester, has replaced Paul Lambert . Heskey plied his trade at Aston Villa for three years between 2009 and 2012 . Heskey, speaking to the Sunday Mirror, said: 'The new manager will have a decent squad to work with. There are international players there - that says it all. 'They have good quality, they are fairly young and have good legs on them. It is just finding the right blend and formula that fits with the players you have got. 'Villa fans are like most - give them something to cheer about and they will get behind you. At the moment there hasn't been anything to write home about.' Aston Villa's biggest problem so far this season has been their inability to score goals. The Midlands outfit have scored just 12 goals in the Premier League - with star striker Christian Benteke failing to hit the back of the net in his last six games. Heskey believes one of Sherwood's main tasks will be to get the best out of the Belgium international after his recent dip in form. The Bolton forward added: 'In Christian Benteke they also have somebody who can get goals for them, and part of the job for the new manager will be helping him get through this little spell when, for whatever reason, it hasn't been happening.'

"A teenage girl was savagely attacked by her own German Shepherd after the puppy ‘suddenly flipped', tearing off part of her face. Iona Manson from Birmingham, needed two hours of facial reconstruction surgery and more than 50 stitches after the mauling, which tore a chunk out of her nose. And the 13-year-old, who had raised Fidden since he was nine days old, is still mystified why her 13-month-old pet suddenly attacked her. Attacked: Iona Manson, 13, needed more than 50 stitches after was mauled by her pet Fidden, who she had raised from a puppy . Remarkably plastic surgeons managed to . piece together Iona's face and today the teenager has barely a scratch . to remind of her of the terrifying attack. But her mother Mhairi Manson, 39, said she was still struggling to sleep after witnessing the ferocious incident. 'It was horrific,' said the former ambulance worker. 'Iona just bent down to give him his plate of food and he just went for her. 'He just flipped, even afterwards when we put him in a cage he growled and barked angrily every time one of us went near him, something had changed in his mind. Recovery: Iona Manson spent three days in hospital after the attack, the 13-year-old is now wary of stranger's dogs . 'When he got off Iona there was so much blood in Iona’s eyes that she couldn’t see a thing and we were sure the dog had got her eyes.' Luckily her father, Scott Manson, an army trainee nurse who previously served 18-and-a-half years as a tank commander, was in the living room and heard the dog growl and Iona scream during the attack. 'I rushed into the kitchen and saw Iona holding her face and screaming as blood poured out,' said Mr Manson. 'I grabbed the first thing I could find to dress the wounds and stem the bleeding which, as it happens, was socks from the washing basket. 'My wife called 999 and shut the dog outside whilst I just went into triage mode to treat my daughter.' And the family say they have no idea why Fidden, who was later put down, suddenly changed. Mrs Manson said they also adopted his brother, Bracken, who has never behaved aggressively. She said: 'The attack was so vicious, it even traumatised Bracken. He cowered in the corner and wouldn’t come out for days. 'We’ve had them since they were nine days old, you just do not expect that to happen from a friendly dog.' Iona spent three days in hospital recovering from the attack. She said: 'I don’t remember much which is probably a good thing. I remember Dad telling me to sit up so that he could see my face and then the next thing I can recall is being in the back of the ambulance and looking out of the window. 'I don’t even remember having a cannula in the back of my hand, and I hate needles.' Today: Iona Manson has made a full recovery and is still close to Fidden's brother Bracken . Greg Markham, a First Contact Practitioner from West Midlands Ambulance Service, said: 'We were told by control that it was an animal bite and, to me, it was one of those jobs that could’ve been nothing. 'When we walked into the house there was too much calm and it was very quiet. As we made our way into the kitchen we found a very calm but shocked Iona with bandages on her face, a lot of blood everywhere.' 'She’s an extraordinary young girl,' added Mrs Manson. 'When she came back from the hospital the first thing . she did was go up to the window to go and see our other dog. 'She’s not so sure about other people’s dogs but she’s not scared, I think the whole thing fazed me more than her.

"Chelsea midfielder Eden Hazard insists he was never likely to join Paris-Saint-Germain after putting pen to paper on a new five-and-a-half-year deal at Stamford Bridge. Hazard, who joined the Blues from Lille for £32 million back in 2012, is thought of as one of European football's brightest talents and it is no surprise that some of the continent's elite suitors have pursued him in recent seasons. PSG, who play Chelsea in the last 16 of the Champions League on Tuesday, were known to have an interest in signing Hazard, but the 24-year-old says any speculation that he would leave west London came purely from the media.

Chelsea played PSG in the quarter-final stage of the Champions League last season, defeating them on the away goals rule after overturning a 3-1 first-leg deficit. And Hazard is backing his team to overcome the French giants again this year in the last 16. 'I don't think it was a miracle against them last year,' he said. 'We shouldn't have lost 3-1 in the first leg, we should have played better some counterattacks. And we made two defensive errors. 'We were a little bit lucky to score in the last minute.

"Arsene Wenger praised Olivier Giroud for his match-winning performance as the France striker's brace was enough to beat Middlesbrough in their FA Cup fifth-round meeting. Giroud, who missed almost three months of the season after breaking his leg in August, reached double figures for the campaign as he struck twice in two first-half minutes as the reigning FA Cup holders eased into the last eight. The 28-year-old remains an important part of Wenger's side despite the summer acquistions of Danny Welbeck and Alexis Sanchez - who started either side of Giroud in a strong Arsenal side - and the Gunners boss feels his compatriot is now a much more rounded player than the one he signed from Montpellier in 2012. Arsene Wenger (left) has described Oliver Giroud as a 'top level footballer' after his two goals in the FA Cup . The Frenchman (centre) scores his second goal with a neat finish at the near post . 'We controlled the game from the first to the last minute,' Wenger said. 'They had one chance at the end from a header, but overall I'm pleased with the way we attacked, the way we defended and with the way we played together with a good focus for 90 minutes. That's basically it. 'I believe that he (Giroud) is a different player today than the guy who arrived here. He understands what top-level football demands, works with a great concentration in training and he has improved tremendously on his mobility, his technical quality and of course his body is very strong. He uses it very well.' Giroud celebrates after scoring his second goal during Arsenal's 2-0 FA Cup win over Middlesbrough . Giroud put the game beyond doubt as he thrashed home Sanchez's corner with a well-taken first-time finish but it was his first strike, just two minutes earlier, which lit up the Emirates on what was a run-of-the-mill afternoon for the home side. All 11 players touched the ball as Santi Cazorla, captain for the day, threaded a pass to Kieran Gibbs to cross low for Giroud to finish and Wenger was left purring at the accomplished move. 'The first goal is what we try to do in our game and our build-up,' he said. Giroud (centre) scores the first goal after a flowing move involving all 11 Arsenal players in the build-up . 'The second goal shows that the game belongs to the players as well because it's a consequence of two players who respond quickly to a situation, analyse it quickly and do what they want to do well. That's basically what it was. It's a consequence of intelligence and technique.' Giroud's position as Arsenal's main striker had been under threat after the arrivals of Sanchez and, in particular, Welbeck but Wenger insists if the France international is named in his starting line-up he will always play through the middle - with the likes of former Manchester United man Welbeck being accommodated elsewhere. 'One of the reasons I bought him (Welbeck) is that he can play central striker and wide,' Wenger added. Danny Welbeck started out wide for the Gunners and Wenger has revealed he likes his versatility . 'I believe he's doing extremely well and is contributing to the team very well. He can play central striker like he did for a long time but the most natural centre forward we have is Giroud. 'All the strikers we have can play in different positions. The only one who can only play centre forward is Giroud, so when Giroud plays the others have to move out wide.' Middlesbrough had beaten reigning Premier League champions Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium to reach this stage - but Aitor Karanka's side never looked like producing similar heroics in north London. Giroud's double knocked the stuffing out of the visitors, who had only one shot on target throughout the game, with Wojciech Szczesny's clean sheet coming under the most threat in injury time as Kike headered Ryan Fredericks' deep cross against a post. Alexis Sanchez (left) and Mezut Ozil were once again impressive for the Premier League outfit . Middlesbrough boss Aitor Karanka feels his side underestimated Arsenal after beating Manchester City . And Karanka thought his side may have been lulled into a false sense of security having already collected the scalp of City, as well as taking Liverpool to penalties in a Capital One Cup tie at Anfield, as the second-placed side in the Sky Bet Championship came up short. 'I think, especially in the first half, we haven't played in the way we like to,' he said. 'It is difficult to beat teams like Arsenal and if you want to take something from games against Arsenal today you have to be perfect, like we were at the Etihad Stadium, and if you make mistakes it is difficult. 'I'm a little bit disappointed because everyone was expecting another game like we played against Liverpool or Man City and this is my biggest concern, we didn't go to the pitch in the way we usually go. In the first half I didn't like anything. 'It could be that the atmosphere (amongst the players) was very exciting and everyone was expecting another win. The players maybe thought it was going to be easier because we played very well against Manchester City two or three weeks ago.'

"Gary Lineker has insisted the BBC would have screened Bradford's FA Cup fifth-round clash had their opponents been known prior to the fourth-round replays. And the League One side didn't let him forget it by posting a cheeky tweet aimed at Lineker and Mark Chapham following their giant killing against Sunderland. The corporation has come in for criticism after overlooking the League One club despite their stunning upset of Chelsea in the last 32. Gary Lineker and Mark Chapam were subject to a cheeky tweet from Bradford City following their FA Cup win . Match of the Day 2 presenter Mark Chapman was also targeted by Bradford's cheeky tweet . Of the eight ties played across three days, Bradford's was one of only three not shown live by either the BBC or BT Sport. And the Bantams did their bit to make the broadcasters regret their decision by upsetting Sunderland 2-0 at Valley Parade to reach the quarter-finals for the first time since 1976. Sunderland needed a replay to get past Fulham in round four and Lineker claimed that was a key factor in the BBC selecting Aston Villa's clash with Leicester and Manchester United's trip to Preston ahead of the Bradford match. Billy Clarke (centre) fires Bradord ahead with the help of a deflection during their victory over Sunderland . Jon Stead (right) seals the tie with a neat finish to complete the FA Cup fifth round giant killing . The presenter tweeted: 'The BBC can only show 2 ties in each round and select them pre replays. If they could've waited Bradford would obviously have been chosen.' Bradford fans made their feelings known during the match, causing embarrassment for one veteran BBC presenter. Look North stalwart Harry Gration tweeted: 'I am in trouble. Filmed singing are you watching BBC. Sorry'. Lineker led the BBC's coverage from Villa Park as the home side held on for a 2-1 victory in a match that only came to life in the final stages. The poor fare on offer prompted Match of the Day presenter Mark Chapman to write on Twitter: 'We're debating whether this goes last on tonight's £Motd or whether we leave it off altogether.'

"Appalled: David Cameron on the findings of a report into the deaths of up to 1,200 people because of poor care in hospitals run by the Mid Staffordshire trust . Hundreds of hospital patients died in the biggest NHS scandal in living memory because of a box-ticking culture and a failure of compassion, a damning official report will say today. David Cameron is appalled by the findings of a long-awaited report into the deaths of up to 1,200 people between 2005 and 2008 because of poor care in hospitals run by the Mid Staffordshire trust. It is expected to blame managers who cut costs and reduced staffing levels in an attempt to hit Labour’s ‘efficiency’ targets and win foundation status. The Prime Minister will respond to the findings by announcing the creation of a new chief inspector of hospitals, who will be charged with ensuring hospitals deliver good, compassionate care rather than simply ‘chasing targets’. Mr Cameron is expected to say: ‘We need a hospital inspection regime that doesn’t just look at numeric targets, but makes a judgment about the quality of care.’ The system will be modelled on that introduced in the early 1990s in education, where a chief inspector sends regular inspection squads into classrooms to assess all aspects of school life. Ministers believe thousands of patients could be at risk because examples of poor care reminiscent of that at Stafford and Cannock Chase Hospitals are ‘dotted around’ the NHS. Mr Cameron, who has taken the unusual decision to make a statement on the report to MPs himself today, will offer ‘a strong expression of sorrow’ for the suffering of the families of patients let down by the hospitals. Whitehall sources said the report would identify a culture of ‘metrics and league tables’ in the way hospitals are judged as a key factor in the scandal. Scroll down for video . At risk: Ministers believe thousands of patients could be at risk because examples of poor care reminiscent of that at Stafford Hospital (pictured) and Cannock Chase Hospital are 'dotted around' the NHS . ‘We need to look at patients as human beings, not numbers on a chart,’ said one. ‘We can’t tolerate a situation where hospitals are meeting all the targets, ticking all the boxes, and the reality is people are drinking water out of vases and sitting in their own excrement. ‘You can’t legislate or mandate for compassion, but we must try to find a way to make sure the NHS is absolutely focused on making sure people get good quality care when they are in hospital – one of the most vulnerable times of their lives.’ Responsible for supervising: The report will make uncomfortable reading for NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson . The report into the scandal, led by Robert Francis QC, was handed to Downing Street and the Department of Health yesterday. It is also expected to call for better training for nurses and healthcare assistants, and an overhaul of regulation to ensure poor managers are weeded out. It will make uncomfortable reading for the Labour front bench and for the chief executive of the NHS, Sir David Nicholson. Between August 2005 and April 2006, he ran the West Midlands Strategic Health Authority, which was responsible for supervising the hospitals. His tenure came during a four-year period in which between 400 and 1,200 patients died needlessly due to a catalogue of failings and appalling standards of care. Sir David also helped appoint Martin Yeates as chief executive of Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust – which presided over the disaster – even though he had no managerial training. Doctors in A&E at Stafford Hospital have since admitted that the whole department became ‘immune to the sound of pain’. Patients were shunted into corridors and neglected so they did not count towards a four-hour waiting-time target. Sean Worth, a former adviser on health to the Prime Minister, claimed that the scandal at Mid Staffordshire was followed by ‘one of the biggest cover-ups in public service history’. Mr Worth, who now works for the think-tank Policy Exchange, said a ‘Praetorian guard of NHS elites, trade unions and stuffy medical organisations’ were standing in the way of making the NHS more accountable to patients. 'Box-tick' culture: Whitehall sources said the report would identify a culture of 'metrics and league tables' in the way hospitals are judged (file picture) John Moore-Robinson: Misdiagnosed in hospital . The parents of one of the youngest victims of the Stafford scandal are calling for a new inquest because they believe staff covered up their mistakes. John Moore-Robinson, 20, died in 2006 from major internal bleeding which was not picked up by doctors in Stafford Hospital’s A&E unit. He had fallen off his mountain bike and ruptured his spleen. But he was diagnosed with a few fractured ribs and sent home in a wheelchair with a sick bucket. He died hours later at his home in Coalville, Leicestershire. At an inquest in 2006, the coroner returned a narrative verdict meaning no one was blamed. But it has since emerged that the coroner did not see a vital report. The report, by consultant Ivan Phair, concluded that the death was ‘avoidable’ and that there was a ‘high probability that the level of care delivered to Mr Moore-Robinson was negligent’. Mr Moore-Robinson’s parents, Janet and Frank, are seeking to overturn the verdict and want a new inquest. Mr Moore-Robinson told BBC Newsnight: ‘Had John died as a result of the accident I could have accepted it as his injuries were so serious. But John needed care and the A&E department at Stafford was in meltdown.’ Lawyers representing the trust deny there was a cover-up.","David Cameron is appalled by findings of a report into 1,200 deaths in hospitals because of poor care .

"Tim Sherwood threw aside any reservations like a club-crested gilet as Aston Villa scored the goal that clinched their progress to the FA Cup quarter-finals. Having allowed himself a smile when Leandro Bacuna’s wonderful strike flew in, he punched the air with all the glee of a lifelong Villa fan after Scott Sinclair’s tame effort somehow outfoxed Mark Schwarzer one minute from time. Sherwood watched this tie from the stands as first team coach Scott Marshall took control in the dugout. But after a goalless opening period, Villa’s 11th consecutive first half without scoring, the new manager was in the dressing room at the interval to address certain issues. From the outside, his words seemed to have had an immediate impact. Scott Sinclair celebrates after he clinched the win for Aston Villa with his 89th-minute strike at Villa Park . Tim Sherwood was delighted with Sinclair's goal, and can be seen here clenching his fists in celebration . Sherwood was a reserved figure for much of the game but he could not hide his enjoyment at Villa's second goal, punching the air . Leandro Bacuna opened the scoring in the second half with a powerful strike from long range at Villa Park . Sinclair knocks in Villa's second goal, although it had a hint of good fortune with Schwarzer at fault . Aston Villa (4-3-3): Given 7; Hutton 7, Vlaar 7, Clark 7, Cissokho 6.5; Cleverley 6.5, Westwood 6, Delph 6.5; Bacuna 7.5 (Sinclair 77 mins), Benteke 6, Weimann 6 (Grealish 82) Subs not used: Cole,  Guzan, Lowton, Okore, Sanchez.

Subs not used: Albrighton, Hamer, Hammond, King, Moore, Vardy. Booked: Konchesky, Simpson. Manager: Nigel Pearson 5. Referee: Mark Clattenburg 7. Man of the match: Leandro Bacuna . Attendance: 28,098. Villa beat Leicester by raising their attacking fluency in the second half and despite Andrej Kramaric’s consolation in stoppage time, a loud roar greeted the final whistle. Heaven knows these supporters, long-starved of much to shout about, would embrace a trip to Wembley, now just one win away. Premier League survival is the prime concern, of course, but there were signs of encouragement here, too. Paul Lambert was sacked and Sherwood installed because Villa desperately required a change to shake this underperforming squad into life and out of the relegation zone. The bounce hoped for by Sherwood’s arrival has got off to a springy start. ‘Tim came in the dressing room before the game briefly, introduced himself and wished the boys the best,’ said Marshall. ‘He came in at half time and made a couple of points to everyone about things he had spotted. There was a lot of individual detail there, it was not one big sweeping statement. ‘I put across my points about the game, what I thought and what I saw, and he had an input after that. He brought some good info to the group, good football knowledge that comes with experience and a lifetime in the game.’ Sherwood, who watched this match sitting between chief executive Tom Fox and head of recruitment Paddy Reilly, will convey those ideas at his first press conference as Villa boss on Monday before turning his attention to the visit of Stoke City on Saturday. For his opposite number, this was another bad Sunday. Seven days ago Nigel Pearson was sacked then reinstated as Leicester manager. Here, the club’s fans requested he ‘sort it out’ and also decried the performance as a ‘load of rubbish’ during the closing stages. Pearson explained the decision to stick with five at the back against English football’s worst attack because Villa play narrow and the system might come in useful as Leicester fight to stay in the top flight. Trialled first in the defeat at Arsenal, it seemed unnecessary against a Villa side that had scored 15 goals in all competitions this season prior to kick-off. But three minutes after Pearson replaced Marcin Wasilewski with Leo Ulloa to go to 4-4-2, Villa took the lead. There were plenty of empty seats on show at Villa Park with the teams recent troubles seeming to keep fans away . Leicester's Paul Konchesky puts in a challenge on  Bacuna as the Aston Villa man attempts to attack down the right wing . Kramaric, fresh from scoring his first Leicester goal against Arsenal in midweek, runs at Andreas Weimann . Riyad Mahrez rides the tackle of Aston Villa captain Ron Vlaar as both sides battled it out for an FA Cup quarter-final place . Shay Given leaps across his goal to brilliantly tip away a shot from Leicester's Matty James at Villa Park . In the 68th minute Ron Vlaar, recalled for his first match since injuring his knee at Crystal Palace on New Year’s Day, found Bacuna on the left flank. The Dutch winger cut inside Danny Simpson and unleashed a shot that flew into the far corner. Christian Benteke was also recalled by Marshall but he wasted his one big chance by blazing over the bar in the 72nd minute when put clean through. Villa’s second goal did come with a minute left on the clock. Benteke lofted a ball to Sinclair, who wriggled around Simpson and just about hit a shot on target. But Schwarzer should have done much better than blocking with one hand before fumbling the ball in with the other. Kramaric runs with the ball ahead of Aly Cissokho during the fifth round tie at Villa Park on Sunday . Aston Villa striker Christian Benteke wins a tussle for the ball with Leicester centre back Matthew Upson .

Simpson and Bacuna can only watch as the ball flies towards the top corner of Mark Schwarzer's net . Neither Schwarzer not Wes Morgan could do anything to stop the excellent strike in its path as it headed for the net . Bacuna wheels away to celebrate his brilliantly-struck goal that sent Aston Villa into the last eight of the FA Cup . Bacuna is mobbed by his team-mates as Villa grabbed their second home goal in their last two games at Villa Park . Leicester had shaded the first-half chances but only beat the excellent Shay Given in stoppage time — Kramaric scoring past the Irish keeper with a firm header. It was all too late for Leicester fans who had voiced their concern. ‘People are entitled to their opinion,’ said Pearson, whose side go to Everton on Sunday. ‘What we have to do is find a way of being consistent during a game and then game-to-game. We need mental resilience, absolutely.’ Just the kind of thing Villa have recruited Sherwood to provide. Sinclair shoots past Danny Simpson to double Villa's lead in the second half at Villa Park . Schwarzer's error saw him almost knock the ball into his own net after initially stopping Sinclair's strike . Sinclair celebrates his strike with fellow substitute Jack Grealish - and it proved to be the winner with Kramaric's consolation . Sinclair delighted the Villa fans, albeit in a depleted crowd, with his impact and first goal since he moved on loan from Manchester City .

Summer signing Fryatt rose highest to guide substitute Jack Hunt's cross past a diving Lee Camp after 72 minutes to complete an unlikely turnaround.

Bradley Johnson scored his second spectacular goal in the space of four days as Norwich City recovered from a dreadful start to claim a hard-fought 3-1 victory against Blackburn Rovers at Carrow Road. With 87 minutes on the clock and the game locked at 1-1 Johnson, who scored a cracker in Saturday's 3-0 win over Watford, curled a glorious left foot shot over Paul Robinson to put the Canaries ahead. Lewis Grabban then scored his second of the night deep into injury-time to confirm City's second win of the season.

"Peter Moores was forced on to the defensive yesterday as he attempted to explain the all too familiar story of Australian domination over an England side led by a captain desperately struggling for any sort of form. England were transported back a year to their worst Ashes nightmare on Saturday when they were outclassed by a rampant Australia at the start of a World Cup when they again made a late decision to make significant changes. This time it was Ravi Bopara who was jettisoned at the last minute from an England side who were supposed to have been given maximum preparation time to settle before finally launching a challenge for that elusive first 50-over title. Australia's Mitchell Marsh celebrates after dismissing England captain Eoin Morgan in their World Cup opener . England coach Peter Moores (right) has defended his players but knows they must improve significantly . As a consequence of that, Gary Ballance came in for his first one-day international in six months and James Taylor, who has impressed at three both here and in Sri Lanka before Christmas, was pushed down to the No 6 position. And Chris Woakes, who dropped century-maker Aaron Finch in the first over at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, was not helped by the decision to take the new ball away from him for only the second time in 16 one-day internationals. A thumping defeat at the hands of the hot favourites is far from fatal to England's chances of making an impact in this tournament but it was the apparent muddled thinking that raised serious concerns about their progress. England are not meant to be experimenting now after the Ashes were brought forward, to their considerable cost, to give them every chance of forging cohesive plans ahead of their 11th attempt to win a first World Cup. But England coach Moores passionately denied that England panicked ahead of their big Valentine's Day date with the hosts while also backing Eoin Morgan to come through a woeful run which threatens to undermine his authority here. 'It's a red herring,' said Moores when asked whether the late changes had unsettled England before a 111-run defeat that could have been so much worse. 'I can categorically say no. You don't drop a catch because you think you should be opening the bowling. And both Gary and James would say they are versatile. They can play at three or six and James was very comfortable where he was.' Yet Moores did hint that his young, promising but inexperienced side may have frozen in front of 85,000 in the face of a ferocious Australian outfit. 'The players have to ask 'did we play the style and brand of game we wanted?' And if we didn't, we are going to have to look at how we do that. Each individual will have to look and ask if they got the best out of themselves.' England batsman James Taylor plays a shot against Australia during the match at the MCG in Melbourne . Eoin Morgan's form has come under particular scrutiny in recent weeks . Morgan, made captain on the brink of the World Cup when England finally stopped backing Alastair Cook in one-day cricket, is becoming England's biggest concern, not least because he is in worse form over the last year than the man he replaced. 'Eoin will be as frustrated as anybody,' said Moores after Morgan's fourth duck in five innings. 'He wants a score. Of course he does. But he handles himself well and is practising and doing everything in the right way. 'So this is a case for support. For backing himself and getting out there and trusting that his form will come back and his quality will come through.' Moores pointed to Morgan's century against Australia in the first game of the Tri-series as evidence that he is not under the same pressure as Cook found himself before England pulled the plug on him after a 5-2 defeat by Sri Lanka. 'There is a difference. For Alastair it was over time. For Eoin you're going back less than a month since he scored a brilliant hundred at Sydney. That showed all the best of Eoin. It had brute power, placement and the pacing of an innings. He's got to keep it simple and back himself to do the business. He isn't the sort of bloke to hide from this. He knows he has to go out and perform.' There was an honest admission from Moores that England, who are consistently leaking too many runs towards the end of a one-day innings and went for more than a hundred off the last 10 on Saturday, got their bowling badly wrong. 'It wasn't just about execution,' said the England coach. 'Our plans weren't as good as they should have been. There's no point hiding from it. I think in this game the players were sucked into the width of the square boundaries and thought that (short balls) were their best option. We have under used yorkers.' A deflated James Taylor leaves the field during England's humbling defeat to Australia . Aaron Finch puts in an assured batting performance for Australia . At least there was the encouragement of an impressive contribution from Taylor in his new position, the Notts batsman only being denied a century by a crass umpiring error created by confusion over the Decision Review System. 'We all felt for him because he had played so well,' said Moores of Taylor's 98 cut short when Jimmy Anderson was run out when the ball should have been dead after an upheld lbw appeal. 'There's nothing we can do, really. The decision was made and what was right was the respect shown to the umpires.' It is very early in this tournament to get into 'inquest' mode and it is expecting a lot of England, a one-day side destined to play catch-up because of their understandable prioritising of Test cricket, to challenge the big guns immediately. But England will certainly expect better when they take on New Zealand, another powerful one-day side on home soil, here in Wellington on Friday. 'We know we were playing against a side at the top of their game on Saturday but we also know we have to close the gap because the next time we play Australia it will probably be in the knock-out stages,' added Moores. For now England can look no further than making sure they actually reach those knock-out stages. England batsman Chris Woakes plays a shot during the Pool A 2015 Cricket World Cup match .

"A few days before England’s World Cup squad flew out to Brazil last summer, Danny Welbeck made it clear that he expected to be given a run of games up front when he returned to Manchester United. We are coming up to the anniversary of that conversation —which happened in the swanky resort of Quinta do Lago in Portugal — and nothing has changed, except his club. On Sunday, wearing the colours of Arsenal in this FA Cup fifth-round tie against Middlesbrough, the forward was shoe-horned into this team. Few could displace Olivier Giroud on his current form. Danny Welbeck (centre) was not played in his preferred central position in Arsenal's FA Cup victory . The Gunners forward misses a chance to add to his meagre goal tally of seven for the season . Arsenal's main striker Olivier Giroud scored both goals in the 2-0 defeat of Middlesbrough at the Etihad . Welbeck experienced similar difficulties at Manchester United before being shown the exit door . Instead, Welbeck is in familiar territory, forced on to the wing again because Giroud, one of the most under-appreciated players at the highest level of the game, is scoring at will. In many ways Welbeck is a victim of his own versatility, squeezed out to the wing in this cup tie because Giroud is a first pick for Wenger when he is fit. Wenger said: ‘If you look at the history of my strikers, most of them have been able to play in different forward positions over the year. The only one who hasn’t and probably has to play up front is Giroud, but the rest have been able to play wide if necessary.’ In the days of Thierry Henry he could pop up wherever he wanted, but Welbeck is playing with more tactical discipline as he works his way into this team. Against one of the best sides in the Championship, Welbeck started on the left and swapped with Alexis Sanchez to play on the right after the break. His afternoon ended when he was replaced by Theo Walcott in the 72nd minute. Even though he is on the same pitch as some players with genuine pedigree — Alexis Sanchez, Mesut Ozil and Santi Cazorla operate at a different technical level from the others — this is not what he signed up to. Welbeck is competing with the likes of Alexis Sanchez (left) and Giroud to become the main man at Arsenal . Welbeck's versatility has often worked against him but his work rate is appreciated by all . Danny Welbeck's heat map against Middlesbrough showed that he struggled to get into dangerous positions - CLICK HERE for more stats from our brilliant Match Zone service . The 25-year-old was eventually substituted for alternative winger Theo Walcott (right) after 71minutes . Welbeck's finest moment in an Arsenal shirt came with a Champions League hat-trick against Galatasaray . When he arrived from Manchester United at the end of the summer transfer window, Welbeck wanted to be the star of the show in an Arsenal shirt. Instead, we are waiting for him to really get going. He touched the ball 38 times at the Emirates on Sunday, a long way short of the the 128 touches taken by the imperious Cazorla and his midfield partner Ozil (116). If it came down to work-rate in the Barclays Premier League, then Welbeck would win a place in this team every week. He has scored some goals, netting his first for the club in a 3-0 victory at Aston Villa in September and scoring a hat-trick against Galatasaray in a 4-1 win the following month. Suddenly, though, he seems vulnerable. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger insists that his forwards often play in a variety of positions . Welbeck will be hoping to progress in the same way that Thierry Henry (left) did under Wenger's guidance . Welbeck will not have a guaranteed place in the team when a number of stars return from injury . Despite being a favourite of Roy Hodgson, Welbeck could find his England place under threat . Next month an England squad will be announced for the games against Lithuania and Italy. Welbeck is coming under pressure from Harry Kane. He is a favourite of Hodgson’s, but to keep his place in the team for club and country the forward will need to play in his preferred position. It seems that if Giroud is fit, he will always start ahead of Welbeck. The Frenchman has now scored 11 times in the FA Cup. In a few weeks, as Arsenal power on for a place in the top four and another appearance in an FA Cup final, the competition will be fierce in this squad. Heavyweights such as Jack Wilshere, Aaron Ramsey, Mikel Arteta and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain will be making demands of Wenger as they enter a crucial phase of the season. When that moment arrives, you begin to wonder where Welbeck will fit in.","Arsenal moved into FA Cup quarter-finals with 2-0 defeat of Middlesbrough .

"Criticism: Nick Robinson, pictured outside 10 Downing Street, said BBC executives feared uncensored debate . The BBC made a ‘terrible mistake’ by not reflecting the public’s concerns about immigration, its political editor has admitted. Nick Robinson said that during Labour’s years in government, BBC executives feared an uncensored debate about the issue would stoke racism. As a result, viewers’ concerns about pressure on jobs and wages, and cultural tensions were not aired as the BBC ‘had decided these are not acceptable views – and that was a terrible mistake’. Claiming that attitudes have changed, Mr Robinson was speaking ahead of tomorrow’s screening of his documentary The Truth About Immigration, which is set to reveal new data about the scale of public concerns. However, amid debate over the lifting of controls this month on Romanians and Bulgarians coming to settle in Britain, critics say the BBC still has some way to go. As recently as November, the broadcaster was giving uncritical blanket coverage to a report about the economic benefits of immigration that was dismissed as ‘fatally flawed’ by Mervyn Stone, one of the country’s most senior statisticians. Sir Andrew Green, of the think-tank Migration Watch, said: ‘Nick Robinson is right – the BBC has a lot to answer for. ‘They were largely silent as immigration rose from 50,000 a year to 250,000 a year under the previous government and as net foreign migration reached nearly 4million. ‘Their coverage has improved a  little in the face of overwhelming public opinion, which many of them seem to despise.’ Mr Robinson said in interviews at the weekend that the public ‘deserve the truth because although immigration has been top of the political agenda, the real debate about it has scarcely begun’. Controversial: Mr Robinson said that whether to allowi BNP leader Nick Griffin on Question Time caused 'huge argument' In the run-up to eight Eastern European countries joining the EU in the early 2000s, BBC managers ‘feared having a conversation about immigration’ as they believed it would ‘unleash some terrible side of the British public’. Mr Robinson said: ‘The same people who said you couldn’t have [British National Party leader] Nick Griffin on Question Time said: “Don’t talk about this. Do you know what you’re going to unleash? Do you know the horrors that are going to come?” ‘There was huge argument within the BBC about that.’ He said his documentary would go through the ‘mistakes and miscalculations’ about immigration numbers made by the Labour government. Fear: Mr Robinson said that ever since Enoch Powell (pictured) gave his infamous 'Rivers of Blood' speech in 1968, the BBC has shied away from discussing immigration . Accusing the BBC of being ‘too slow to recognise and reflect the concern, dislocation and anger felt by many’, he said: ‘We worried too much about airing views that might offend some viewers and listeners and not enough by the offence caused to people who did not hear their own concerns reflected on air. That, I am happy to say, has now changed.’ Mr Robinson said the country was beginning to have an honest discussion about immigration, and the fact that it might result in greater competition for jobs, housing and school places, while also benefiting the economy as a whole. In the same interview, Mr Robinson did not deny that there was rivalry between him and Robert Peston, the BBC’s economics editor. ‘We’re not mates,’ he said. ‘He’s not part of my social circle. Are we fairly assertive individuals? Yes, probably – removing the word “fairly”.’ Former Tory Cabinet minister Michael Portillo, a regular BBC contributor, said: ‘The BBC has failed in the immigration debate over a 40-year period. ‘Ever since the Enoch Powell speech [about immigration in 1968], there has been such a fear that immigration equals racism that the BBC and other outlets have banished reporting the full facts for fear of stoking racism.’ In an interview in 2011, the BBC’s former director-general Mark Thompson admitted that there had been ‘some years’ when the broadcaster was ‘very reticent about talking about immigration’. He added: ‘There was an anxiety about whether or not you might be playing into a political agenda if you did items on immigration.’","Mr Robinson said BBC executives were afraid of uncensored debate .

"The last surviving Klansman convicted in an Alabama church bombing that killed four black girls 50 years ago spends nearly all his time in a one-person prison cell, apparently too wary of other inmates to venture out. Thomas E. Blanton Jr., one of three men convicted in the bombing, is allowed to have regular contact with other prisoners in a day room and go outside a few hours a week for exercise, but a prison spokesman said Blanton rarely does either. Instead, as one of the most infamous prisoners currently in state custody, the 83-year-old man mostly keeps to himself. Jefferson County Sheriff's Deputies lead Thomas Blanton Jr., out of the courtroom in handcuffs after a jury convicted him of murder in Birmingham, Alabama in May, 2001 . 'You might describe him as a loner,' Department of Corrections spokesman Brian Corbett said yesterday. A powerful dynamite bomb detonated outside Birmingham's 16th Street Baptist Church on September 15, 1963, killing 14-year-olds Addie Mae Collins, Carole Robertson and Cynthia Wesley, and 11-year-old Denise McNair. Sarah Collins Rudolph, Addie's little sister, was critically injured in the attack as the girls prepared for Sunday worship. She joined relatives of the other victims on Tuesday, as they were posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal. Numerous events are being held this week in Birmingham to mark the anniversary of the bombing, and a fresh round of news coverage is once again focusing attention on the bombers. Yet Corbett said Blanton isn't receiving any special protection during anniversary commemorations since he's already confined in the most secure way possible. This Sept. 16, 1963 photo shows investigators and spectators outside the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama, following an explosion that killed four young girls . Victims: From left, Addie Mae Collins, Carole Robertson, Denise McNair and Cynthia Wesley . Investigators work outside the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama on September 15, 1963 . 'That's the way he lives all the time based on the high-profile nature of his case,' Corbett said. The four young victims of the Birmingham Alabama church bombing have been awarded the highest civilian honor by the House and Senate, 50 years after their death. The Congressional Gold Medal has been awarded to 14-year-olds Addie Mae Collins, Carole Robertson and Cynthia Wesley, and 11-year-old Denise McNair. The ceremony was held five days before the 50th anniversary of their deaths in an attack that helped speed the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965. While no one was arrested in the bombing for years, three Ku Klux Klansmen eventually were convicted in the blast: Robert Chambliss in 1977; Blanton in 2001; and Bobby Frank Cherry in 2002. Chambliss and Cherry died in prison, but Blanton remains incarcerated at St. Clair Correctional Facility, located about 35 miles northeast of Birmingham, where he is serving a life term after being convicted of four counts of murder. Blanton may be mostly silent now, but his own words helped convict him 11 years ago. Jurors heard secretly recorded tapes in which Blanton told his then-wife that he had been at a meeting where 'we planned the bomb'. Several years before Blanton's trial, Cherry told investigators that Blanton was crazy, a 'little thief' and a 'lowlife' who wasn't welcome in the Cherry household, according to FBI investigative files obtained by The Associated Press through the Freedom of Information Act. Oprah Winfrey, and President Obama look on as members of the late Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr's family ring the bell from the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama, on August 28, 2013 . Survivor: Sarah Collins Rudolph, who survived the blast that killed her sister, attends a ceremony to award the victims with the Congressional Gold Medal . How the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama looks today, in September 2013 . Many Alabama inmates live in large dormitories with bunk beds, but Blanton is held in a more-secure block with one-man cells. There's a day room that Blanton rarely visits, Corbett said, and he seldom goes outside for the five hours of exercise he's allotted each week. 'He spends the vast majority of his time alone by choice,' said Corbett. Blanton is in generally good health, but he has only one regular visitor, a daughter, who comes to see him occasionally, Corbett said. While Blanton typically uses his shower time – 10 minutes every other day – he neither participates in religious activities nor has company for meals. 'He eats alone. He's served meals in his cell,' said Corbett. A fourth suspect in the bombing, Herman Cash, died in 1994 without ever being charged.

"The European Union could survive without Britain but not France, outgoing Brussels chief Herman van Rompuy has claimed. Bowing out as European Council President claimed a UK exit would only 'wound' the EU project, but the departure of France would leave it 'dead'. And he mocked David Cameron's claim to have vetoed an EU budget rise in 2011. Scroll down for video . Outgoing European Commission President Herman van Rompuy insisted the EU could survive without the UK . Mr Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's membership of the EU before holding an in-out referendum by 2017. The Prime Minister is expected to use a major speech within days to announce Tory plans to curb immigration from the rest of Europe, including limiting the total number which can come to Britain. However, he has clashed with senior Brussels figures and other EU leaders over any attempt to alter the principle of freedom of movement. In a farewell lecture in Paris today, Mr van Rompuy said he believed the other 27 member states would be ready to look seriously at London's demands for change. But he insisted that the fundamental principles of the EU were not open to negotiation. Speaking at the Sciences Po Institute of Political Studies last night, Mr van Rompuy said: 'Without the United Kingdom, Europe would be wounded, even amputated - therefore everything should be done to avoid it. But it will survive. Without France, Europe - the European idea - would be dead.' Looking ahead to Mr Cameron's promised renegotiation and referendum, the European Council president said: 'This is primarily a British debate. It is for the British people to decide. 'I think that the European partners would be ready seriously to examine those demands which are important for London, but not to negotiate on the fundamental principles of our Union.' However, he took a swipe at Mr Cameron's claim to have vetoed a 2011 treaty change to tackle the euro crisis, describing it as 'an unfortunate attempt at a veto'. The veto led to the other EU states pressing ahead with the same measures as an 'accord' between 26 members. David Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's membership of the EU before holding an in-out referendum by 2017 . Mr van Rompuy acknowledged in August that 'the British question' would be a major challenge for Europe under his successor Donald Tusk, thanks to Mr Cameron's promise to renegotiate the UK's membership ahead of an in/out referendum in 2017 if Tories win next year's general election. 'For my part, I have never had anything to complain about from the British. Their Government has been constructive in the major negotiations on the European budget, on the climate or on our strategic agenda for 2014-19. 'And often it has pulled others forwards, on the single market or on certain foreign affairs issues - Iran, Syria. 'Of course, the United Kingdom is not part of the largest project - the euro - nor in the Schengen area. But London has never prevented us from moving forwards. 'Admittedly, there was an unfortunate attempt at a veto in December 2011, but on banking union - the most important integrationist move since the birth of the euro - Great Britain has been very constructive, and rightly so, because community legislation was necessary.' Mr van Rompuy said there was 'a more fundamental historical reason' for wishing the UK to stay in the EU. 'It is important that the British, who have been part of all the great intra-European wars since the 16th century, remain part of the great peace project that is the European Union,' he said. 'Besides, their presence is important in terms of political equilibrium at the heart of the European Union, including relations between the great countries.'","Outgoing Brussels chief insists the EU would survive without the UK .

"India began their World Cup title defence with a 76-run victory over Pakistan in Adelaide on Sunday. The 2011 winners, who have now triumphed in all six of their World Cup encounters against their fierce rivals, were indebted to Virat Kohli's century and fifties from Shikhar Dhawan and Suresh Raina as India made 300 for seven from their 50 overs despite Sohail Khan's five for 55. Pakistan made a decent start in reply but were the architects of their own downfall as they slipped from 102 for two to 224 all out. Captain Misbah-ul-Haq scored a well-crafted half-century, but it ultimately counted for nothing as India ran out comfortable winners. Virat Kohli celebrates his century during India's convincing win over Pakistan . Kohli played beautifully as his hundred pushed India up to 300, a total that was well beyond Pakistan . The Indian captain has not been in top form but looked back to his best to start the World Cup defence . India made a sluggish start to their innings and Rohit Sharma had made only 15 when he attempted to pull a Sohail delivery that was simply not short enough to do so. The India opener succeeded only top-edging to the off-side and Misbah ran in from mid off to take a simple catch. Kohli joined Dhawan at the crease and the pair put on 129 runs in just over 22 overs for the second wicket, during which time both reached their half-centuries. Dhawan reached his 12th ODI fifty but was soon trudging back to the pavilion having been run out by Ahmed Shehzad for 73 in the 30th over after Kohli rejected his request for a quick single. Kohli was dropped on 76 in the 32nd over but punched their air with delight 11 overs later when he reached his 22nd ODI century and second against Pakistan. Only Sachin Tendulkar, with 49, has scored more ODI tons for India than Kohli. Misbah-ul-Haq lead the chase for Pakistan, but his 76 was not enough to get his side anywhere close . Two balls later, Raina was raising his bat to acknowledge reaching fifty but their partnership was broken in the 46th over when Kohli charged Sohail and succeeded only in edging behind. His 127-ball innings yielded 107 runs, with eight fours. India's innings stuttered to a conclusion once Kohli's resistance had ended, with Raina mistiming a Sohail short ball to be caught at cover and Ravindra Jadeja bowled by Wahab Riaz to leave India five down. India's hopes of surpassing 300 were in jeopardy when Sohail dismissed Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Ajinkya Rahane with successive balls to claim his fourth and fifth wickets but, after successfully negotiating the hat-trick delivery, Mohammed Shami hit two runs off the final ball of their innings as India made 300 for seven from their 50 overs. Pakistan's innings was just three overs old when Younus Khan edged Shami behind, but Shehzad and Haris Sohail made steady progress as Pakistan reached 67 without further loss after 15 overs. Kohli celebrates taking a catch to dismiss Shahid Afridi as Pakistan collapsed in Adelaide . Shikhar Dhawan cuts on his way to a half century as India piled on the runs against their rivals . India made a second breakthrough at the end of the 18th over when Haris (36) edged Ravichandran Ashwin to first slip, and Shehzad, after surviving a run-out scare soon after, took Pakistan past 100 but then fell three runs shy of an 11th ODI half-century when he picked out Jadeja in the field to give Yadav his first wicket. Pakistan's collapse began two balls later when Sohaib Maqsood chased a wide, short Yadav delivery and succeeded only in edging to Raina in the slips as Pakistan slumped to 102 for four. Pakistan had only added one run to their total when Umar Akmal became their fifth batsman dismissed, nicking Jadeja behind. India's appeals were initially waved away but the decision was overturned when Dhoni chose to review. Umesh Yadav (centre) celebrates taking an early wicket as India's bowlers backed up their batting effort . Misbah and Shahid Afridi were Pakistan's last real hope of getting anywhere near India's total, but the 1992 World Cup winners suffered a further blow when Shami removed Afridi and Wahab in the 35th over to leave Pakistan reeling at 154 for seven. Misbah pocketed his 39th ODI half-century with some last-gasp resistance but the game was up in the 46th over when, three overs after Yasir Shah fell for 13, the skipper holed out to Rahane in the deep to give Shami his fourth victim. Misbah's 84-ball knock of 76, which featured nine fours and a six, proved in vain as India wrapped up victory in the very next over when number 10 Sohail fell to Mohit Sharma.","Virat Kohli hits 107 as India make 300-7 in Adelaide .

"The United States used a British spy base to listen in on the phone calls of Angela Merkel and 35 other world leaders, it was claimed last night. RAF Menwith Hill in North Yorkshire, which is run by America’s National Security Agency (NSA), is the biggest surveillance and interception facility in Europe. The base analyses satellite signals as well as mobile phone and electronic data from private individuals, governments and corporations. Concern: RAF Menwith Hill in Yorkshire has now been dragged inot the intelligence scandal . Last week it was reported that American spies had been listening in on the phone conversations of dozens of world leaders. Claim: NSA whistleblower J Kirk Wiebe implicated the British base . The allegations led Mrs Merkel to call Barack Obama and ask him to account for his agents’ actions. Now fresh claims by US whistleblower J. Kirk Wiebe, who worked for the NSA for 30 years, have dragged Britain into the scandal. Mr Wiebe believes US agents used the base to intercept the German leader’s phone calls – with the full knowledge of British officials. He told The Mail on Sunday it was likely agents at Menwith Hill ‘either directly collected the data or would have processed data’ from the bugged calls before sending the information back to Washington. Mr Wiebe, who left the NSA in 2001 over fears it was illegally gathering ‘huge swathes’ of electronic data from citizens in the US and globally, said: ‘If the information didn’t come from there, it is almost a certainty that it would have been processed there.’ He added: ‘Everything goes through there to be analysed before the information is sent back to Washington.’ Menwith Hill, which has 33 distinctive golf ball-shaped ‘radomes’ to house satellite dishes, was effectively handed over to the Americans in the 1950s in recognition of the important intelligence-sharing relationship between the two countries. The base works closely with Britain’s own top-secret listening station, GCHQ in Cheltenham. Committee: Former Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell said there needed to be a 'robust and easily understood legal system of control' Any information processed or analysed at Menwith Hill is then sent back to NSA headquarters in Fort Meade, Washington. The Ministry of Defence insists Ministers are ‘fully briefed on the activities at RAF Menwith Hill’. But concerns have long been expressed about the lack of scrutiny US spying operations face when they are carried out on British soil. Responding to calls for greater transparency, the Commons’ Intelligence and Security Committee – whose members are among a select group of British politicians with security clearance to visit the site – has promised to review the laws that keep a check on intelligence-gathering by Britain. Former Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell, one of the MPs who sits on the committee, said there needed to be a ‘robust and easily understood legal system of control’. Listening in: Last week it was reported that the USA had listened in on world leaders including Angela Merkel (pictured) He told The Mail on Sunday that the current system of regulation was set up before some of the ‘far-reaching capabilities of intelligence-gathering’ were in existence. Sir Menzies said: ‘Parliament must therefore be ready to review whether the existing legislation is good enough. When it comes to relations with other countries there is a well-established relationship between the five eyes – the UK, USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. ‘Of these relationships, the one between the UK and the US is by far the strongest. But no matter the strength of any relationship, the responsibility for legality and for review must always rest with domestic government.’ Documents leaked by  NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden in June revealed how spies based at Menwith Hill managed to intercept Dmitry Medvedev’s calls as the former Russian president visited Britain for the G20 summit in 2009. But Mr Wiebe’s claim suggests that the base is used to intercept calls from politicians all over Europe, not just those who are  visiting the UK. The Ministry of Defence said: ‘We do not comment on intelligence matters.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","RAF Menwith Hill, run by NSA, is the biggest surveillance facility in Europe .

"With about three minutes left, Paris Saint-Germain’s social media guru was so confident the team would cruise to an easy 2-0 win they decided to poke some fun at Jose Mourinho. The French champions may have been down to nine men after suffering four injuries — two after their last substitution had been made — but such was their superiority, there seemed zero chance of letting it slip. So, those following PSG’s Twitter account saw: ‘PSG forced to “Park the Bus” (shout out to Jose Mourinho!) in the final minutes.’ Oh how it backfired. Five minutes later, Caen had bounced off the ropes to earn a draw, PSG’s players were trudging off and Chelsea’s manager had the last laugh. Caen players  celebrate after drawing level with PSG at the Parc des Prince on Saturday . Ibrahimovic looks dismayed at full time after his PSG side threw away a two-goal advantage to Caen . Four injuries, as Laurent Blanc admitted afterwards, are ‘hard to accept’. As preparation for Tuesday night’s Champions League last-16 tie with Chelsea, it couldn’t have gone much worse. Blanc sounded like a manager who had conceded defeat before a ball had been kicked. He said: ‘If someone had told me this story, I would not have believed it. We will play bravely but there are not many solutions, with four or five injured. It’s an extraordinary challenge.’ The four definitely out of the Chelsea contest are Yohan Cabaye (adductor muscle), Marquinhos (thigh), Serge Aurier (quadriceps) and Lucas Moura (adductor). PSG''s Serge Aurier is carried away on a stretcher after he was injured during the draw with Caen . PSG's Brazilian midfielder Lucas Moura (right) vies with Emmanuel Imoroue for the ball on Saturday . The fifth player who Blanc alluded to is Blaise Matuidi, who is now rated 50-50 for the Chelsea game. PSG’s confidence will have taken a blow, too. They were coasting to the top of the table with minutes remaining after goals from Zlatan Ibrahimovic (72 seconds in) and Ezequiel Lavezzi. But after Aurier collapsed in a heap seconds after the final change had been made and Lucas hobbled off after receiving a knock, the nine men were pressed into a rearguard action. They couldn’t hold out. A minute after the ‘Park the Bus’ jibe, Emiliano Sala pulled one back and Herve Bazile’s stunning free-kick sent the visitors into raptures. ‘It was a bizarre game,’ admitted PSG captain Thiago Silva. ‘I can’t understand what happened. We need to stay positive.’ Ibrahimovic celebrates with typical style after putting his side in front in the French league match .

Hamburg must dread their visits to Bayern Munich. A couple of years ago, Bayern caned them 9-2 and this time they lost 8-0! Thomas Muller, Arjen Robben and Mario Gotze all scored two, while Robert Lewandowski and Franck Ribery also netted. ‘We lost a game, we shouldn’t mourn,’ said Hamburg coach Josef Zinnbauer. But Chelsea should still be wary. Ibrahimovic was his usual self, scoring what can only be described as a ‘kung-fu kick’ goal after the telescopic extension of his leg to meet Aurier’s cross. Zlatan then removed his shirt to reveal tattooed on his skin the names of 50 people the United Nations World Food Programme have helped. Lavezzi was excellent, taking his goal well with a crisp low shot while Marco Verratti was metronomic with his passing. Edinson Cavani, who has attracted interest from Manchester United, didn’t even get off the bench. But if lowly Caen can expose weaknesses, you have to fancy Chelsea to get the job done.

"The No Make Up Selfies which have taken the internet by storm over the last two days are thought to have raised a staggering £1 million for charity. And now the Fellas of Facebook and Twitter have decided they too want to get their mugs in on the action and a flurry of selfies featuring men in make-up have started appearing online. Sean Lawson Bisset from Dunbar, East Lothian glammed up in support of the ladies who have been stripping their make-up back for charity . Stuart Laurie puckers up in Lippy and eye make-up and Raymond Galea also flutters a girly eyelash . Rachel Horkan submitted a photo of her . 12-year-old brother  Zach, while . Martin Helliwell, 29, from Lancashire, piled on the slap to raise . awareness. Some of the fellas seem to have gone girly and cute, while others were maybe inspired by Halloween outfits when they got out the slap, but their efforts were all commendable. Scott McGarrity, left, went with heavy eyeliner and blusher while, Liam Allan, right chose a smoky eye and pink lips . Meanwhile the #NoMakeUpSelfie shows no signs of dieing down just yet as women continue to strip back their look in the name of charity. Kath Abrahams, Director of Engagement and Income generation at Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: . John-Hunter went the whole way with make-up, wig and dress . 'We are delighted to see the success of the no make-up selfie viral campaign. It is great to see the British public getting behind the campaign and helping to raise awareness of breast cancer. 'Here at Breakthrough, we have seen a huge spike in the number of unique visitors to our website, smashing our record to date. We have received hundreds of donations from people simply texting PINK to 70300 in the past 24 hours. We would like to thank all those who have supported us, enabling our scientists to continue their life-saving research. 'Breast cancer is not yesterday’s problem; every ten minutes a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer. Anything that gets the public behind this important cause is to be celebrated. It isn’t too late to get involved, so go ahead and text PINK to 70300.' Wayne Mcgregor looks, erm, pretty in pink and a splash of lilac. Nathan Reynolds was on trend with a strong brow. He definitely didn't obey the natural lip rule for spring though. Most women usually shy away from the camera if they're not wearing at least a slick of mascara or a pop of colour on their lips. But anyone using social media over the last 48 hours can't fail to have noticed a flurry of snaps featuring women with no slap on. In fact the trend has taken Twitter and Facebook by storm with thousands of females wiping off their make-up and posting photos using the hash tag #NoMakeUpSelfie. Dancer Felixy Splits says it's not only important to raise awareness but to donate anything you can . Lisa Shepherd, left, posted her no make-up selfie to Facebook, as did Laura Peters on the right . Everyone from cancer survivors to men in full drag have been posting pictures in on Twitter and Facebook. Though nobody seems to know where the idea came from, the rule seemed to be that women post their picture and then nominate other female friends to do the same with all posting that the photos were to 'raise awareness of cancer'. After becoming aware of the flurry of selfies, Cancer Research sent out a tweet saying: 'We’re loving your #cancerawareness #nomakeupselfie pics! The campaign isn’t ours but every £ helps #beatcancersooner.' Cancer Research says so far it has raised £1million in 24 hours. Cancer Research UK, while not affiliated with the #nomakeupselfie hashtag, are supporting it . Deborah Ferguson (left) and Penny Stretton (right) posted no makeup selfies to raise awareness . Claire Louise Stanleick encourages friends on Facebook to donate with her makeup-free selfie . Those posting the selfies or nominating others to do so are texting the word BEAT to 70099 TO DONATE £3. Carolan Davidge, director of communications at Cancer Research UK said, “The #nomakeupselfie Twitter trend isn’t something Cancer Research UK started – but it’s great to see so many people getting involved to help raise awareness of cancer amongst their friends and family. If people would like to choose to support our work to beat cancer sooner, they can visit www.cruk.org.” Sisters Natalie Kirby, left and Joanne Kirby, far right, posed make-up free. Joanne's daughter Charlotte also put in her support. It's not known where or how the trend for using a no make-up selfie started this time around although last week author Laura Lippman caused an online storm with a similar campaign in support of actress Kim Novak and her appearance at the Oscars. Now, following this new viral selfie campaign the Facebook group No Make Up Selfie For Cancer Awareness has more than 153,690 likes and hundreds of photo uploads. Cancer . survivor Deborah Ferguson from Liverpool submitted her photo to the . Facebook group and agreed to have it published on MailOnline. She . said: 'Can I campaign on behalf of all neglected boobies please? Give . them a check,  I did that's why I have such a big smile as am a survivor.' Another participant., Abigail Spillman said: 'I think it is a fantastic way to raise awareness. Its only been going on since yesterday and already it is trending worldwide. 'Along with a #nomakeupselfie and a small donation (if you wish) is a massive help. Well done on using Facebook and Twitter for putting it to good use!' Sophie Williams, who works for a PR firm, told MailOnline she posted her #nomakeupselfie and promises to donate 50p for each like she receives to Cancer Research UK. Dancer Felixy Splits posted a fresh . faced pic, and told MailOnline: 'Everyone knows someone who has suffered . from this awful disease. 'It's not only important to raise awareness but to donate anything you can. Make a difference and do something positive today.' Katie Weirwas nominated by her friend and by doing so she donated £5 to the charity . Katie Weir of Freya Lingerie also joined in. She told MailOnline: 'Through the recent nomination trend on Facebook it is easy to see the power of social media and how quickly posts can go viral. 'It is fantastic to see young women embracing their make-up free faces to raise awareness of breast cancer. 'I was nominated by my friend and by doing so I donated £5 to the charity which I wouldn't have done if I hadn't seen the status!' Sophie Williams promises to donate 50p for each like she receives to Cancer Research UK . Social media users have taken the internet by storm posting no-makeup selfies . And it's not just women who are getting in on the action. In solidarity, men too have com up with their own way of raising awareness - but they're slapping on the make-up. Rachel Horkan submitted a photo of her 12-year-old little brother Zach in full make-up. She . wrote: '[He] decided to put the make-up on as us girls are taking it of . all to help cancer awareness, so proud of him to do this at such a young . age!

"'Sexting' is now a criminal offence in Victoria, with new laws introduced to target people who share sexually explicit images of another person. From Monday, anyone who maliciously or deliberately spreads intimate images of another person faces prosecution under two new offences. The ban applies to intimate images of anyone under the age of 18 as well as images of adults without their consent. Those who illegally spread such images can be jailed for up to two years. Those who threaten to distribute them can be jailed for up to one year. Scroll down for video . In September, a Sydney pool cleaner Peter Sheather (pictured) become the first man in NSW to be found guilty of 'sexting' after a judge jailed him for at least three years . Two new offences now apply in Victoria, which could see people who send intimate images of anyone under the age of 18 or images of adults without their consent imprisoned for up to two years . The two new offences apply to anyone who maliciously or deliberately spreads intimate images of another person . In Victoria, it is now banned to circulate intimate images of anyone under the age of 18. it is also illegal to send images of any person without their consent . Those who illegally spread such images can be jailed for up to two years. If a person threatens to send these images, they could face up to a year in jail. The new laws also introduce exceptions to child pornography offences so those under 18 will not be prosecuted or placed on the sex offenders' register for consensual, non-exploitative sexting. Attorney-General Robert Clark said it was important the law kept up with changing technology. 'Previously, the law provided only limited protection against malicious distribution of intimate images and this behaviour can cause considerable harm to victims, especially when images go viral,' he said in a statement. In September, a Sydney pool cleaner become the first man in NSW to be found guilty of 'sexting' after a judge jailed him for at least three years. Peter Lewis Sheather, 42, appeared in The Downing Centre Local Court where he admitted to using a mobile phone to harrass women by sending them lewd text messages, photographs and videos on his iPhone 5 between December 2013 and April this year. The court heard that the resident of Cammeray, north Sydney, was a 'depraved' man who sent sexually explicit material to nine women telling them of his desire to 'f****' them by the pools that he cleaned. Sheather sent sexually explicit videos, photos and messages to nine women, telling them of his desire to 'f****' them by the pools that he cleaned . Police stated that Sheather's sexting campaign caused 'fear and offence' against the eight women pool owners. Sheather was sentenced to three years in jail . He had been charged with using a carriage service to menace, harass or offend after police seized laptops and documents from his home in late April. In sentencing the 42-year-old magistrate Roger Prowse said Sheather was a 'depraved' man. 'If you had to look up the word depraved, you would find an entry: Peter Sheather,' he said. He said Sheather deserved nothing less than a jail sentence for harrasing his nine victims  - customers of two pool maintenance firms, Pool Doctor Services of Roseville on Sydney's upper north shore and Swim Art in Rose Bay, in the eastern suburbs. Sheather referred to several of his victims by name in a message saying, 'I'd love to f*** you in your pool', the court heard. Victoria's Attorney-General Robert Clark says it is important the law keeps up with changing technology, to consider the damage that occurs when intimate images go 'viral' Police facts tendered at a court hearing in June court stated Sheather's sexting campaign which caused 'fear and offence' against the eight women pool owners began on March 4 this year when he sent a text to a woman named Sheila at at 12.29pm saying, 'Hey u. Did you get my photo this morning'. A second text to Sheila on March 14 at 7.12pm said in part, 'I'd love to f*** you in your pool ... Sheila'. Police say the text frightened and offended the victim due to its 'overtly sexual nature' and the fact it shows the accused knows the victim's name and the fact the victim has a pool which cannot be seen from the street'. The new Victorian offences rule that those who illegally spread sexually explicit images of people under the age of 18 or without an adult's will can be jailed for up to two years . Sheather's next victim was a woman named Brittany who on March 7 at 7.03am he texted a message with 'a picture of a male standing naked with a semi-erect penis'. The head and face of the man could not be seen in the photo. The accompanying message read, 'Shower time. Wanna join me honey?' Nicole did not answer because she believed the message was spam, however just over seven hours later, at 1.47am on March 20, Sheather sent her a 15 second long video which police say 'depicted an erect penis being masturbated and ejaculating' with a message saying, 'Nicky McSticky?'. Sheather's last victim was a woman called Catherine, who he texted at 5.30pm on April 10 saying, 'I'd love to take to [sic] downstairs and f*** your brains out in your pool while you look over the harbour'. Those who threaten to distribute images illegally can be jailed for up to one year according to Victoria law .","Sexting is now a crime in Victoria with two new offences in place on Monday .

"The three bungling Iranian bombers detained in Bangkok after they accidentally set off their explosives cavorted with prostitutes at a beach resort days before the botched attacks. A photograph has emerged of the trio cosying up to sex workers, surrounded by hookah-pipes and drinks, in a bar in the notoriously sleazy city of Pattaya. The revelation comes as it emerged police are now hunting for two more suspects, including a possible bomb expert, they think helped the trio as they set about targeting Israeli diplomats. Before the bombs: Iranian trio Masoud Sedaghat Zadeh, left,who  was arrested in Malaysia, Mohammad Khazaei, centre, who was detained at Suvarnabhumi Airport, and Saied Moradi, who was badly injured in the bombings, are pictured drinking with prostitutes . The foiled plan was discovered on Tuesday when explosives in the men's rented house blew up by mistake, forcing them to flee. Two men, including one who blew off . his own leg when he hurled a grenade at police but it bounced back at . his feet, were detained in the Thai capital. A third was captured the following day in Malaysia as he tried to return to Iran. After . flying into the southern city of Phuket on February 8, the men moved to . Pattaya, 45 miles southeast of the capital, and stayed there for at . least two nights before heading to Bangkok. Marked men: CCTV of the three Iranians, before they were caught with explosives in their Bangkok home . Mistake: Iranian Saeid Moradi, who is still alive, had his legs blown off after a grenade he hurled bounced back onto him, as police closed in on him outside a Bangkok school . It was there that the group met with prostitutes, one of which was brought to Bangkok to identify the suspects yesterday. A mobile phone image taken by one of the women, published by the Bangkok Post, purportedly shows the three Iranians at a Middle Eastern bar or restaurant. They appear to be surrounded by hookah water-pipes, two of them cradling women in their arms, the men posing for a photo around a low, drink-filled table on which there appeared to be at least one bottle of beer. Detained: Mohammad Hazaei (centre) speaks to police after he was arrested at Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok on Tuesday night . Explosion: Bomb disposal experts work on the Bangkok house rented by three Iranian men, which was blown up on Tuesday . The woman who took the photograph said one of the now-detained suspects, Mohammad Kharzei, had asked her to escort him 'because he was not good at speaking English'. She said she brought two companions for Kharzei's friends, and they had drinks and played snooker together. The woman detected nothing awry, except when one of the Iranians 'barred her from approaching a closet' in his hotel room. The botched plot has ratcheted up tensions between Iran and Israel, which is accusing Iran of waging a covert campaign of state terror that included a bombing Monday in New Delhi that tore through an Israeli diplomatic vehicle, wounding an Israeli diplomat's wife and driver, and a failed bomb attempt the same day in the former Soviet republic of Georgia. Investigation: A Thai bomb disposal expert analyses the damage following the blasts in Bangkok on Tuesday . Carnage: A bomb disposal expert checks out the damage, which also hit a police car, on Tuesday . Iran has denied responsibility for all three bomb plots, and blames the Jewish state for the recent killings of Iranian atomic scientists. Thailand's national police chief said yesterday that the detained Iranians were plotting to attack Israeli diplomats, citing the similarity of so-called 'sticky' bombs that can be attached magnetically that were used in New Delhi and Tbilisi. Today, Bangkok police commissioner Lt Gen Winai Thongsong announced authorities were searching for two more suspects in the case. This included one man who was seen early on Tuesday on CCTV footage as he left the same house where the accidental explosion later took place. Warning: Israel and the U.S. have told their citizens to be alert in the capital . Destruction: Saeid Moradi lies on the ground, by a telephone box, after his legs were seriously wounded in the blast . Police said the man was seen leaving the residence with a bag in his hand, and had been coming and going repeatedly in the days prior to that. The same cameras captured each of the three Iranian men leaving the residence shortly after an explosion ripped the roof of the house that afternoon. Winai said the newest suspect was 52, and of Middle Eastern descent, but gave no other details and did not give his nationality. He said police also are looking for an additional suspect who had rented the destroyed home with an Iranian woman named Leila Rohani who is now believed to be back in Tehran. Besides Kharzei, the two other detained suspects are Saeid Moradi, whose leg was sheared off by explosives he was carrying on a busy Bangkok street as he tried to flee, and Masoud Sedaghatzadeh, who was arrested in Malaysia and was trying to return to Iran.","Photograph shows trio cosying up to sex workers in sleazy Pattaya resort .

"Banks across America appear to be fighting the growing protest against income disparity and rising fees as the Occupy Wall Street movement spreads worldwide. A series of videos filmed across the U.S. in New York City; Santa Cruz, California and St Louis, Missouri, show customers staging protests and mass account closures. However, footage has emerged showing what . appears to be dozens of Citibank and Bank of America customers denied . requests to close their accounts, some even being arrested after alleged . clashes with branch managers. Scroll down for videos . Arrested: Video footage shows a woman being detained outside of a Citibank branch in Manhattan after she attempts to enter with her chequebook in hand . After a weekend of demonstrations spreading around the world, Occupy Wall Street is today celebrating the one-month anniversary of when its movement began. President Obama wants to tap into public anger to turn up the heat on congressional Republicans as he embarks on a bus tour to rally support for his $447 billion jobs plan. Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin defended plans to bolster social spending and said it would help stave off any similar protests there. In Britain hundreds of anti-capitalist protesters mingled with bemused bank workers outside St. Paul's Cathedral in London on Monday. Back in New York protesters are planning more events, including a 'National Day of Protest to Stop Police Brutality' on Saturday. Celebrities are continuing to endorse the protest. Martin Luther King Jr's son said that his father would have joined the demonstration. Protesters continue to camp out in Manhattan's Zuccotti Park, but temperatures will fall to 50F (10C) this week, which could drive some away. Video footage obtained by Gawker.com . earlier this month shows dozens of people corralled inside of a Citibank . branch in Manhattan's Greenwich Village, some signalling inside they are . facing arrest. A woman dressed in a business suit . holding a checkbook attempts to enter but is stopped by officers outside . who ask her if she was part of the protest. After . calmly insisting she is a customer of the bank, a plain-clothed officer . detains her. Police swarm as she appears to be taken back inside - one . of 24 people arrested on charges of criminal trespassing, reports the . website. Citibank said in an official statement the group was 'very disruptive and refused to leave after being repeatedly asked'. A bank spokesman said one person . asked to close an account and was accommodated and acknowledged that the . branch was closed 'until the protesters could be removed'. The footage follows a video uploaded . to YouTube on October 8, which shows three Occupy Santa Cruz protesters . attempting to close their accounts at a local Bank of America branch. Mob: Police swarm as the woman appears to be taken back inside - one of 24 people reportedly arrested on charges of criminal trespassing . Two of the women are shown walking into the branch and sitting down, one of them with a large placard. A manager asks the women to leave and . threatens to call police, claiming 'you cannot be a protester and a . customer at the same time'. The women leave and vow to return without a sign the following day to close their accounts. The scenes were reminiscent of a . rally in St Louis on August 12, which saw several people lining up . outside of a Bank of America branch in effort to close their accounts. Banned: Two women were ordered out of a Bank of America branch in Santa Cruz, California after attempting to close their accounts in protest . Video footage uploaded on YouTube shows demonstrators shouting on bullhorns outside of the . branch in protest, as Bank of America employees stand outside barring the . group from entering. The spectacles come weeks after both Citibank and Bank of America unveiled plans to hike fees for its services. Earlier this month, Citibank . announced changes to its mid-tier checking accounts, which offer the . potential for earning interest and a few other perks. Starting in . December, Citi will charge $20 a month on these accounts, unless the . customer has combined balances of $15,000 or more in checking, savings . and investment accounts or loan balances. Rally: Protesters gather in St Louis, Missouri, where company employees bar them from coming inside to close their accounts . The fee was previously waived for . combined balances of $6,000 for that level of account, which offers . perks such as interest-bearing checking. Customers also pay $2 fees for using non-Citi ATMs if they don't meet the balance requirement. Last month Citi said it will no . longer give rewards points for debit card transactions. That stemmed, in . part, from changes in federal regulations that cut roughly in half the . amount banks could charge retailers for processing purchases made on . debit cards, a rule that's cutting sharply into bank revenue. Citi's move came just a few days . after Bank of America Corp said it would be charging $5 per month for . using debit cards starting next year. President: Barack Obama - pictured today in North Carolina - wants to tap into public anger to turn up the heat on congressional Republicans as he embarks on a bus tour to rally support for his $447 billion jobs plan . Weekend action: Occupy Wall Street protesters shout slogans against banks and economic system while they take part in a protest at Times Square in New York on Saturday . Other banks have also been testing . such fees. U.S. cities large and small were . 'occupied' over the weekend by the group that calls themselves 'the 99 . per cent': Washington, D.C., Fairbanks, Alaska, Burlington, Vermont, . Rapid City, South Dakot, and Cheyenne, Wyoming were just a few. More than 70 New York protesters were . arrested Saturday, more than 40 of them in Times Square. About 175 . people were arrested in Chicago after they refused to leave a park where . they were camped late Saturday, and there were about 100 arrests in . Arizona - 53 in Tucson and 46 in Phoenix - after protesters refused . police orders to disperse. Joining together: Protesters in Oregon, left, and Toronto, right, were out in solidarity this weekend . Making a stand: Demonstrators march towards the state Capitol during an Occupy Atlanta protest on Saturday, left, and sit in New York's Zuccotti Park on Monday . About two dozen people were arrested in . Denver, and in Sacramento, California. Meanwhile, . an offshoot movement called Bank Transfer Day appears to be gaining . momentum. A statement on the movement's Facebook page encourages . supporters to take a stand against big banks by removing their funds on . November 5th. 'Together . we can ensure that these banking institutions will always remember the . 5th of November!! 'If the 99% removes our funds from the major banking . institutions on or by this date, we will send a clear message and give . the 1% a taste of the fear that we experience every day when we aren't . able to pay for our rent, food, medication, utilities, student loans, . etc.,' it reads.

"Walking your dog, enjoying wine with a picnic and even meeting friends in the street have been turned into offences in a sweeping expansion of police and Town Hall powers, a report warned last night. A study by the Manifesto Club revealed widespread use of a string of little-noticed laws introduced by the last Labour government. The group warned that ‘ordinary freedoms and legal protections have been suspended in large areas of public space’. Wrong? Enjoying wine with a picnic or meeting friends in the street have been turned into offences in a sweeping expansion of police and Town Hall powers . Most of the laws were passed under the banner of Labour’s ‘respect’ agenda which aimed to crack down on anti-social behaviour. For example, rules banning drinking in public places were supposed to target teenage drinking in parks. But the powers are so widely drawn that they can be trained on families enjoying a picnic. The Manifesto Club said there is particular concern that many of the zones - which are decided by the authorities drawing lines on a map - are not clearly marked. This means members of the public can commit an offence without knowing they have done anything wrong. Several pensioners have been caught out by ‘no-dog’ zones they did not know about. The penalties can be harsh. ‘Drinking in a designated public place' is a criminal offence, and usually punished by an on-the-spot fine. The maximum penalty is £500 in some areas. It would be logged on the Police National Computer. Dog walking in an area where it is banned, such as straying into a play area in a public park, is a civil matter. But in all cases the person would end up in court if they didn't pay the fine – which means a potential criminal record. Walking the dog: The Manifesto Club warned that 'ordinary freedoms and legal protections have been suspended in large areas of public space' Josie Appleton, director of the Manifesto Club, said: ‘Ordinary freedoms and legal protections have been suspended in large areas of public space. 'An everyday activity can be an offence if you do it on the wrong street. When officials have such open-ended powers, they can make up the law as they see fit' Josie Appleton, Manifesto Club . ‘An everyday activity can be an offence if you do it on the wrong street. When officials have such open-ended powers, they can make up the law as they see fit. ‘At the very least, these zones should all be marked: it is fundamentally unjust that people could be punished for offences they did not know they were committing. In the long run, we need a serious debate about whether we want these controls spreading across our public spaces.’ Local authorities across the UK have enacted the zones. In London alone, the authorities have declared 435 special ‘zones’ which ban the public from taking part in what are normally considered law-abiding activities. Combined, the exclusion zones cover half of the capital. Not welcome: Schoolchildren picured out in the dispersal zone in south-west London. There were 32 dispersal zones in London found by the Club . The Manifesto Club used Freedom of Information laws to discover there are: . •        110 leafleting zones, within which people must buy a council licence if they want to leaflet. There were 37 fines for the offence of 'unlicensed leafleting' in 2011-12. •        32 dispersal zones, within which groups of two or more people can be asked to leave the area and not return for 24 hours. There have been 547 recent orders to disperse. •        219 dog exclusion zones, within which people cannot walk their dogs. There were 56 fines for the offence of walking dogs in a no-dog zone in 2011-12. •        74 alcohol confiscation zones, within which people can have their alcohol confiscated. The Metropolitan Police issued 663 fines for the offence of drinking in public in 2010, and there are several thousand alcohol confiscations each year. The Manifesto Club has delivered a string of warnings about how the public is being subjected to increasingly draconian powers. Earlier this year, the group warned how armies of civilian ‘busybodies’ with as little as five days’ training have been handed sweeping police powers which allow them to destroy people’s careers. Freedom of Information responses reveal there are now 2,617 snoopers licensed under Labour’s hugely controversial Community Safety Accreditation Schemes – a rise of 1,000 in only three years. They include park wardens, shopping centre staff, park attendants and housing association staff accredited to hand out fines for 'crimes' such as littering, dog fouling and criminal damage. The civilians do not answer to a police constable – and four out of five forces do not bother to keep track on what they are doing once they have been given their powers. •    The Manifesto Club has published an online map of the banned zones in London.

"Former Newcastle and Colombia striker Faustino Asprilla has backed Radamel Falcao to be a success at Manchester United despite his recent injury problems.

"A Pakistani doctor accused of running a vaccination programme for the CIA to help track down Osama Bin Laden should be put on trial for high treason, a government commission in Pakistan has said. Such a charge carries the death penalty and is likely to infuriate U.S. officials, who are pushing for Dr Shakil Afridi's release. He has been in the custody of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency since soon after the May 2 American raid that killed bin Laden. Treason: Dr Shakeel Afridi, left, could hang for helping the U.S. find Osama Bin Laden by setting up a vaccination programme . The agency was humiliated and outraged by the covert American operation and is aggressively investigating the circumstances surrounding it. Dr Afridi's fate is a complicating issue in relations between the CIA and the ISI that were strained to the breaking point by the Bin Laden raid. U.S. and Pakistani officials have said Dr Arifdi ran a vaccination programme in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad where the Al Qaeda leader hid in an effort to obtain a DNA sample from him. Dr Afridi was detained in the days after the U.S. operation. He has no lawyer. A Pakistani government commission investigating the raid on bin Laden said in a statement that it was of the view that: 'a case of conspiracy against the state of Pakistan and high treason' should be registered against Dr Afridi on the basis of the evidence it had gathered. It did not elaborate. The commission, which interviewed Dr Afridi and the head of the ISI, Lieutenant General Ahmed Shuja Pasha this week, has been tasked with investigating how bin Laden managed to hide in the army town of Abbottabad for up to five years, and the circumstances surrounding the U.S. operation. Death scene: The compound where Bin Laden hid was found with the help of the doctor . Situation Room: President Barack Obama and his national security team watched events unfold together. They will be angered by the news . It is headed by a Supreme Court justice, and its members include a retired general, a former diplomat, a former police chief and a civil servant. It is unclear why the body would make this recommendation public, and whether it will lead to charges being filed against Dr Afridi. The commission was formed amid intense international pressure for answers over how bin Laden was able to live undetected for so long in Abbottabad, an army town close to the capital. Sceptics will say it is unlikely to achieve that goal, given the power of the ISI and the army, and may well end up a whitewash. The vaccination ruse has been widely criticised by aid agencies, which have said it could harm legitimate immunisation programmes in Pakistan. The vaccination team was reported to have gained access bin Laden's house in Abbottabad, but that it did not confirm bin Laden's presence there. American authorities are trying to rescue the Pakistani doctor, his wife and children, and take them to the United States, according to Pakistani and US officials.","Pakistani government commission is investigating how Al Qaeda chief hid in country for five years .

"Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson is bidding to take over cancer and end of life care on the NHS in a privatisation deal worth more than £1.2 billion, it emerged today. The tycoon is looking to secure a controversial £689 million contract to provide treatment for terminally ill patients at four NHS clinical commissioning groups (CCGs). It will be the first time cancer care in the NHS has ever been privatised and the move has been described as the health service's biggest ever outsourcing of resources. Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson (pictured) is bidding to take over cancer and end of life care on the NHS . The deal would see the private sector delivering all cancer and end-of-life treatment for children and adults across Staffordshire and Stoke on Trent. On Wednesday the four CCGs involved - which care for more than 767,000 patients - announced which organisations have pre-qualified for the 10-year contracts. Five bidders, including Sir Richard's Virgin Care Ltd, have now been short-listed for cancer care-while seven companies, including Virgin Care Ltd, are in the running for end-of-life services. Christina McAnea, head of health at Unison, has expressed concerns about the plans . The University Hospitals of North Midlands and The Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trusts are the only public sector bodies still bidding for the contracts. IT firm CSC Computer Sciences Ltd, private health provider United Health UK and PFI specialists Interserve Investments have also made the short list. Critics of the move have branded it the 'biggest privatisation in NHS history' and fear it will result in private health providers putting profits before patient care. Gail Gregory, from campaign group Cancer Not For Profit, said: 'I'm actually surprised that there are any public sector organisations on the short-lists at all. beleaguered'The fact there are so many private companies on the lists comes as no surprise, and does confirm our worst fears. 'You have to ask how qualified these companies are to run cancer and end-of-life care, especially as this will be a 10-year contract with no break clause. 'We'd prefer it if these contracts were not awarded at all..' The £1.2 billion deal would see the private sector delivering all cancer and end-of-life treatment for children and adults across Staffordshire and Stoke on Trent (file image) More than 11,000 people have signed petitions against the 'transformation' process. Christina McAnea, head of health at Unison, also expressed concerns about the plans. She said: 'This is by far the biggest procurement process in the NHS and is a dangerous experiment. 'We are talking about £1bn of taxpayers' money and contracts lasting 10 years in vital cancer services and end-of-life care. 'CCGs are potentially handing over all decision-making on cancer and end-of-life care to private companies. 'This is much bigger than just asking private companies to provide a service: this is asking them to design the whole system. 'With profit as the main driving force, how can it not lead to problems?' The Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust (pictured) is one of only two public sector bodies bidding for the contracts . But the CCGs insist the move is needed in order to ensure NHS services are co-ordinated properly. Andy Donald, chief officer for Stafford and Surrounds and Cannock Chase CCGs, said: 'Our aim is to deliver the best possible cancer and end-of-life care for patients in Staffordshire so today's announcement represents a significant milestone for our programme. 'We will be continuing to listen and gather feedback from our communities to ensure we reach our goal of delivering care that is among the best in Europe right here in Staffordshire.' Pre-qualification was the first stage in a procurement process which will run until next summer 2015, and no contracts will be agreed before the next May's General Election . Earlier this year a spokeswoman for the Department of Health said: 'The key thing is that patients get the best possible care, free at the point of use, no matter who provides it.' A spokesman for Virgin Care said they were unable to comment on any 'ongoing potential procurements' but added: 'We have been providing care to NHS patients for over eight years. 'During this time we have treated over two million people and provided better value for the NHS as well as excellent patient care.' Sir Richard's sprawling business empire is hard to keep track of. He is the seventh richest British citizen. His first business venture was founding magazine Student when he was 16. In the 1970s he opened a chain of record stores and in 1984 launched Virgin Atlantic Airways. In September 2004, Branson announced he was launching space tourism company Virgin Galactic. His core business areas are travel, entertainment and lifestyle. In the 1970s, Branson opened a chain of record stores and in 1984 launched Virgin Atlantic Airways . Among his many businesses are Virgin Atlantic, Virgin Galactic, Virgin Money, Virgin Holidays, Virgin Active, Virgin Media,Virgin Trains, Virgin Air Balloons and Virgin Music (now part of EMI). Virgin Care Ltd, which has been shortlisted to take over cancer and end of life care, already runs more than 230 NHS and Social Care services. Since 2006 Virgin Care has treated more than four million people. The Virgin brand made headlines last week when a pilot was killed during a test flight of Virgin Galactic’s prototype space tourism rocket. In 2010 Sir Richard became patron of the UK's Gordon Bennett gas balloon race, which has 16 hydrogen balloons flying across Europe. Sir Richard has also made several world record-breaking attempts including the fastest Atlantic Crossing in 1985 and in 1991 crossing the Pacific from Japan to Arctic Canada in a hot air balloon.","Virgin Care LTD is one of five companies short-listed for 10-year contract .

"Vicente del Bosque claimed Spain were entering a 'new era' after their first competitive game since a hugely disappointing World Cup. Goals from Sergio Ramos, Pedro, David Silva, Sergio Busquets and debutant Paco Alcacer gave Spain a comfortable 5-1 victory over Macedonia in their opening European Championships qualifier. Spanish paper Sport went with the headline: 'The future is yours,' accompanied by a picture Barcelona youngster Munir. New era: Valencia youngster Paco Alcacer scored on his debut while Munir also featured for the first time . Marca and As were also full of praise for the revitalised national side. Marca claimed that Spain had 'rediscovered' themselves while also praising Iker Casillas's performance. As also commended Spain on their style and quoted Del Bosque as saying: 'In the World Cup we lost our reputation. We have started a new era.' Praise: Both Marca and As were full of praise for the national side after they beat Macedonia . Meanwhile, the Italian press focused on new Italy manager Antonio Conte's competitive debut after the Azzurri beat the Netherlands. Tuttosport says Ciro Immobile and Simone Zaza will again start up front for Italy after they impressed against Gus Hiddink's side . La Gazzetta dello Sport claimed that Paul Pogba could be in line for a new contract, and point out that the former Manchester United midfielder has already won more than Zinedine Zidane and Michel Platini had at his age.

"Imagine, for a moment, the pressure Tyler Blackett found himself under. To one side, his new manager Louis van Gaal was watching intently. Around him, meanwhile, were seasoned trophy-winning professionals headed by Wayne Rooney, who wondered if he would deliver. This, for the 20-year-old, was a completely new situation. But it was not on the pitch in front of 75,000 expectant fans at Old Trafford, Blackett’s first big Manchester United examination came 38,000 feet above the Atlantic Ocean. Scroll down for video . Promise: Tyler Blackett is expected to win his first England Under-21 cap against Moldova on Tuesday . ‘All the young players did one tour,’ says Blackett, taking up the story about how he was initiated into United’s squad this summer. ‘We had to get up, one by one and sing it over the speaker of the plane. I did a song by Drake [an American rapper], called Hold On, We’re Going Home. ‘It was quite fitting really, as we were on our way back [from Miami after beating Liverpool in the International Champions Cup]. Luke Shaw went first and he did a speech, answering questions from all the senior players. Darren Fletcher and Wayne were behind it. It was all in good spirits.’ If the defender passed that light-hearted examination, an altogether more serious one was presented to him on the opening day of the new Premier League campaign, when Van Gaal handed him his senior debut against Swansea. Chance: Blackett has played in all three of Manchester United's Premier League games . Blackett responded in the 2-1 defeat with a display of some promise and he has now played in each of United’s three Premier League games. Another first is around the corner as he is expected to win his first England Under-21 cap when Gareth Southgate’s side play their final Euro 2015 qualifier in Moldova on Tuesday. For some, the new-found scrutiny and profile would be difficult to handle but Blackett, a lifelong United fan who has been with the club since he was seven, is studious and grounded. He epitomises the type of character that Southgate wants. ‘You have to be disciplined with it and be able to criticise yourself,’ he says during his first interview with a national newspaper. ‘It’s not an easy thing to do and can be quite difficult, especially if you are going to watch a game where you know you have not played your best. But I feel it is something you have to do if you want to improve. It is especially helpful when you are trying to learn how to play a new system [playing three at the back] like we are at United now. ‘We all watch and analyse performances together after matches. You have to study performances on your own too. I’ve not only done that at United. I did it when I was on loan at Blackpool and Birmingham [last season] as well. I get the broadcasts of my games from the media guys at the club. I take them home and watch them on my laptop. ‘Watching the games lets me know where I need to improve. I was watching one game at Carrington recently when Gary Neville walked past. He stopped, shook my hand, said “well done” and left me to it.’ Sing song: Blackett performed Drake's Hold On, We’re Going Home . Challenge: Blackett had to perform in front of United's senior players like Wayne Rooney . Neville is not the only former United great charting his progress. Rio Ferdinand, now with Queens Park Rangers, would take Blackett to one side to offer pointers, while the confidence Van Gaal has given him is clear to see. ‘I still speak with Rio now and he texts me after games,’ says Blackett. ‘He would take me for training sessions on my own where he would give me tips. ‘As for the manager, he said from day one that he was always going to help our cause and give young players a chance. It gave all the young players at the club a lift.’","Tyler Blackett had to perform in front of new manager Louis van Gaal and senior pros like Wayne Rooney .

"What Liverpool and Brendan Rodgers have done with Jordan Henderson deserves more recognition. It’s almost gone under the radar that Henderson is now a regular for club and country, and indeed when he was suspended at the end of last season, that’s when Liverpool dropped crucial points. I saw him play for Sunderland on the right side of midfield and despite lacking killer pace he looked a threat because of the quality of his delivery. Liverpool have taken him to Anfield and under Rodgers he has become a brilliant midfield player who can control a game, keep the ball and use it with intelligence and quality. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Jordan Henderson dazzling on the England training pitch . Making the difference: Jordan Henderson has proved to be a key player for both Liverpool and England . Not bad for a player who was nicknamed ‘Horrendouson’ by some Liverpool fans I know a short time ago. There are lessons to be learned from what Liverpool have done with Henderson. He’s not the only one to benefit at that club. Just look at Raheem Sterling. Now that is an example of man-management and coaching at its very best. It was only just over 12 months ago we were wondering which path Sterling would take as he seemed to be at a crossroads. He’s already a brilliant player, imagine what’s still to come from him. There’s a bigger picture here though. And it explains why some talented youngsters don’t break into top Premier League clubs. Man in the middle: Henderson has established himself in the England team in recent months . Take last season’s top four. Liverpool sign English players and make them better, and so do Arsenal. Chelsea and Manchester City don’t. They are under no obligation to of course, but then that’s part of a big problem for football in England. Some top clubs have no regard whatsoever for English players or the national team. The situation in Germany is massively different. Bayern Munich is a gigantic club, but within its soul it harbours a desire to remain German, and provide players for the national team. It is a club that hasn’t lost sight of its roots. It’s a club that realizes – unlike so many short-sighted people in England – you can have club AND country, there doesn’t have to be a battle between the two. Working his magic: Brendan Rodgers has made Henderson into a key player for club and country . This willingness to work with young talent and make them better - and in some cases get them ready for the England team - is one of the reasons why neutrals warm to Liverpool and Arsenal, and at the same time explains why there is a coldness, almost a dislike of both Chelsea and Manchester City. The latter two clubs sign big players for big money and the manager picks a team. There is very little individual coaching and development of any players at these clubs. Let me give you an example. Micah Richards was brilliant as a teenager, but City have presided over the decline of a great talent. I spoke to Richards last week and he sounded energized by his move, but saddened that he had to leave City – he considers them to be ‘his’ club, that’s where he really wanted to make it. Energized: Micah Richards is looking forward to his loan move to Fiorentina . Chelsea had the best player of the Under 17 European Championships in 2010. Josh McEachran ran the show, and led England to victory. He’s gone out for yet another loan spell this season. Individual players have to take some responsibility of course, but given the talent possessed by Richards and McEachran, both Man City and Chelsea need to take a long hard look at how they do things. Chelsea’s FA Youth Cup record in recent years is brilliant – they’ve appeared in four of the last five finals and won three of them. However you won’t find many people in football confident that any of these youth players will progress to the first team at Stamford Bridge. Why not? Winning trophies is the priority of course, but clubs exist for other important reasons too. There are other goals they should set themselves. If a football club can’t coach individual players to fulfill their potential then there is clearly something wrong. Maybe City and Chelsea should be braver and ask more of their coaches. Maybe both clubs could learn something from Arsenal and Liverpool.","Jordan Henderson is a key player for Liverpool and England .
