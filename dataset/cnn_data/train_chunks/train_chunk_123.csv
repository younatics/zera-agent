Sixth seed Radwanska had earlier continued her fine recent form to beat Serbia's Jelena Jankovic 6-2 2-6 6-0 in the first semifinal.

Victory on Saturday would have seen the 23-year-old climb to a career-high 15th in the rankings, up from 19, but -- just like in the fourth round of January's opening grand slam Down Under -- she had no answer to Radwanska's game. Meanwhile, former U.S. Open champion Juan Martin del Potro reached his second successive final after beating top seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga at the Marseille Open on Saturday. The fourth-seeded Argentine, who has climbed back up the rankings to 10th after long-term wrist problems, won 6-4 6-7 (9-11) 6-3 against the French world No. 6 -- who won this tournament in 2009. Both players had reached the career milestone of 200 match wins on Friday. Del Potro, who lost to world No. 3 Roger Federer in the Rotterdam final last weekend, will face 2010 champion Michael Llodra in Sunday's final. The Frenchman went through after beating Serbian third seed Janko Tipsarevic 6-4 7-6 (12-10) in the second semi. Jurgen Melzer reached the final of the Memphis hard-court event on Saturday, beating Czech third seed Radek Stepanek 6-4 3-6 6-3. The Austrian followed up Friday's win over American top seed John Isner, while Stepanek ended the hopes of 2010 winner Sam Querrey of the U.S. in their quarterfinal . Melzer will face last year's runner-up Milos Raonic on Sunday after the in-form Canadian defeated Germany's Benjamin Becker in straight sets. The 21-year-old, seeking a third ATP title of the year, took just 75 minutes to ease through 6-4 6-4. Fourth seed Raonic fired an impressive 14 aces on his way to a ninth straight victory and remains on course to add to his tournament victories in Chennai and San Jose.","Poland's Agnieszka Radwanska will move up one place in world rankings after Dubai win .

Isner stuns Federer . Despite the loss, Federer remained upbeat about Switzerland's future fortunes in the Davis Cup. ""It was a tight match. Maybe our level dropped a tiny bit, just a game in each set made the difference. I enjoy being with the guys. We will take it tie by tie. It's not a setback, or a step forward, it's nothing like that,"" Federer said, AFP reported. Defending champions Spain have also reached the last eight for the sixth successive year after securing an unbeatable 3-0 lead over Kazakhstan in Oviedo. Marcel Granollers and Marc Lopez defeated Evgeny Korolev and Yuriy Schukin 6-2, 6-3, 6-1 to book a quarterfinal match-up against either Austria or Russia.

"(CNN) -- Former world No. 1s Maria Sharapova and Caroline Wozniacki lit up the court at the Miami Masters on Thursday, but the lights went out on Agnieszka Radwanska and Marion Bartoli in the other women's semifinal. On an eventful day at the U.S. hard-court event, four-time grand slam winner Sharapova and the in-form fifth seed Radwanska both scored impressive victories to set up a final showdown on Saturday. Second seed Sharapova let a 4-1 lead slip in the opening set of her afternoon match with Danish No. 4 Wozniacki, but battled back to secure a 4-6 6-2 6-4 win in two hours and 34 minutes. The Russian, a three-time runner up in Key Biscayne, said she almost paid the price for not keeping to her strengths. ""I'm a very aggressive player,"" the 2012 Australian Open finalist told the WTA Tour's website. ""I go for my shots. I don't hesitate. ""In the first set I stopped doing that a little bit, and it gave her confidence to come back and win that first set, but I'm pleased I got it back right away and managed to win today."" Wozniacki, who lost top spot in the world rankings after Victoria Azarenka won January's Melbourne grand slam, was philosophical in defeat. ""I tried to do my best, and it just wasn't enough today,"" said the 21-year-old, who beat Serena Williams in the last 16. ""I was very close. But this is tennis. One time you win, one time you lose."" Radwanska extended her winning career record against French seventh seed Bartoli to seven matches with a 6-4 6-2 win in a clash interrupted several times by the lights going out. The Pole who was victorious in Dubai earlier this month, registered her 25th win this season, having ended world No. 1 Azarenka's 26-match winning streak in the quarterfinals. ""You're really focused on the match and really want to finish in two sets, then suddenly the lights go off,"" the 23-year-old said. ""It was one of the weirdest matches I've ever played. I was just in the locker room staying focused, trying to stay warm and ready to go."" Bartoli, the 2007 Wimbledon runner-up, was hampered by a hip injury during the match, but still managed to defiantly complete the match. ""I know how it is to be playing with injury and playing with pain, but it's always weird when someone else is struggling with it,"" Radwanska said. ""Today she was still playing and moving very well, though. So I really had to do my 100% in the end."" In the men's draw, world No. 1 Novak Djokovic survived a late rally from Spanish fifth seed David Ferrer to set up a Friday semifinal with Argentine No. 21 Juan Monaco. Having breezed through the opening set, five-time grand slam winner and defending Miami champion Djokovic was made to sweat in the second before sealing a 6-2 7-6 (7-1) success. ""He's like a wall on the court,"" the 24-year-old told the tournament's official website. ""Gets a lot of balls back. He always makes you play an extra shot. ""I needed to play well and aggressive and step into the court from the first point. That's what I did.""

"(CNN) -- Outside of the four grand slams, it's the most coveted title in men's tennis. Through various evolutions, the ATP World Tour Finals is now a $5 million tournament that crowns a grueling, long year. Bringing together the world's top eight stars in head-to-head competition, it will play to capacity crowds in London's eye-catching O2 Arena, starting on Sunday. ""No easy matches, and terrific tennis,"" Roger Federer's coach Paul Annacone told CNN. ""Definitely the biggest event after the grand slams and met with a lot of anticipation and excitement."" World No.1 Novak Djokovic will seek to top off an amazing season already bulging with three grand slam titles, while defending champion Federer is seeking a record sixth victory in the tournament. Djokovic is 69-4 for the year and incredibly clinched his place at the finals by mid-May during his 43-match unbeaten start to 2011, but the Serbian has had injury problems of late and may struggle to be at his best. ""I don't feel obliged to win the tournament in order to make this season perfect but I will do my best to prepare and finish off the season in style,"" he said. The top eight doubles pairings, led this time by the American Bryan brothers Mike and Bob, will also compete for their end-of-year crown. Here's CNN's guide to all you need to know about the sport's ""fifth major."" Who are the contenders? Group A: Novak Djokovic, Andy Murray, David Ferrer, Tomas Berdych. Group B: Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Mardy Fish. Novak Djokovic: Comes into the tournament under an injury cloud after withdrawing from the Paris Masters at the quarterfinal stage with a shoulder injury. But he arrived in London early and has been practicing hard ahead of his opening clash on Monday night against Tomas Berdych. His only previous title at the ATP World Tour Finals came back in 2008 in Shanghai. Rafael Nadal: The 10-time grand slam champion has never won this title, losing to Roger Federer in last year's final. The Spaniard has played second fiddle to Djokovic for much of 2011, losing his top ranking after the Serb beat him in the finals of Wimbledon and the U.S. Open as well as in four Masters 1000 tournaments. But he did win the French Open on clay for the sixth time and helped Spain reach next month's Davis Cup final against Argentina. Andy Murray: Home favorite Murray has again missed out in the grand slams in 2011, losing in the final of the Australian Open to the all-conquering Djokovic and losing to Nadal in the semis at the French Open, Wimbledon and the U.S. Open. But he is in hot form after winning three successive events in Asia, including his eighth Masters 1000 title in Shanghai which lifted him above Federer to third in the world rankings. Roger Federer: The Swiss maestro has been unable to add to his record tally of 16 grand slam titles in 2011, losing in the French Open final after ending Djokovic's winning run in the semis. Came close to repeating the feat at the U.S. Open where he held two match points before losing to Djokovic in the fifth set. But recent titles in Basel and Paris see the 30-year-old in fine fettle as he seeks to make more history. David Ferrer: The world No. 5's best showing in the finals is a runner-up spot to Federer in the 2007 event in Shanghai. He beat Davis Cup teammate Nadal in January's Australian Open but lost to Murray in the semis. He has reached sixth ATP finals this year, including Masters 1000 tournaments in Monte Carlo and Shanghai, winning titles in Auckland and Acapulco. Tomas Berdych: The hard-hitting Czech went out at the group stage in his debut last year with a 1-2 record. Best known for reaching the 2010 Wimbledon final, this year Berdych has won the China Open title and beat Murray in November's Paris Masters quarterfinals before losing to Federer. Jo-Wilfried Tsonga: The popular Frenchman beat Djokovic in his only other appearance in 2008, but still went out in the group stage. Won his sixth ATP Tour title in late September in Metz and comes into the tournament in good form after reaching the final in Paris. Mardy Fish: The first appearance for the American No. 1, who is renowned for his dashes to the net and fine volleying, but his mobility may be hampered by recent injuries. He won his sixth career title in Atlanta and beat Nadal in the quarters in Cincinnati as he reached a career-high seventh in the rankings. How did they get there? Players gain points from playing in the four grand slams, ATP World Tour events including eight Masters Series tournaments, and World Group singles matches in the Davis Cup teams competition. The more prestigious the event, the more points at stake. The top seven players in the rankings are automatic qualifiers, and the eighth spot is reserved for any grand slam winner not in those places -- a rare occurrence, unless injury strikes. Alternates are also invited to step in if a players gets injured during the round-robin play. Serbia's Janko Tipsarevic and Spain's Nicolas Almagro fulfill that role this year. What's at stake? The ATP World Tour Finals is among the most lucrative on the circuit with an unbeaten winner walking away with a check for $1.63 million. Players receive $120,000 for just qualifying, with $120,000 for each round-robin win. An undefeated doubles pair pocket $287,000 from an overall prize purse of just over $5 million. The points gained count towards the final end-of-year ranking. Djokovic is already assured his top spot with a huge gap over Nadal, but back in 2000 Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil dramatically snatched the No. 1 ranking from Marat Safin of Russia when he beat American legend Andre Agassi in the final. How does it work? The players are divided into two groups of four and play each other once in a round-robin format, before the top two in each pool advance to the semifinals. Tournament schedule . It is possible to lose twice, but still progress and win the tournament. If players are tied on the same number of victories, then the total sets won decides -- if this is also equal then it goes down to total match points. Matches are over best-of-three tiebreak sets, having changed from best-of-five in 2008. Can Federer make history? Tied on five titles with Czech star Ivan Lendl and American legend Pete Sampras, Federer is primed to break the record according to Annacone. ""Roger's been playing well, especially the last couple of weeks, so I think he has a terrific chance,"" Annacone, who also worked with 14-time grand slam winner Sampras, told CNN. ""The others are also going to be ready and know this is a big opportunity as well, so I think it will be an interesting event in terms of the matches and results."" Where did it all begin? American Stan Smith was the first winner in Tokyo in 1970, when it was known as the Masters Grand Prix -- organized and promoted by the International Tennis Federation. A rival tournament, the WCT Finals, was run by the World Championship Tennis Tour and continued to exist in tandem until 1989. U.S. legend John McEnroe won five WCT titles, as well as three Masters Grand Prix crowns. The Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) took over the running of the men's tour from 1990 and the event evolved into the ATP Tour Championship, but the ITF promoted a rival Grand Slam Cup for the top-16 players with the best records in the four majors until 1999. They reached an agreement to merge the two events and rename it the Tennis Masters Cup, which ran from 2000 until the latest rebranding in 2009 when the tournament moved to the UK capital. The doubles event, which used to take place at a different venue, has been staged in tandem with the singles since Houston in 2003.","ATP World Tour Finals begin Sunday at London's O2 Arena .

"(CNN) -- Former world No. 1 Rafael Nadal is aiming to reach peak fitness by playing in both the singles and doubles tournaments at Indian Wells this weekend. The 10-time grand slam winner has not played since losing to Novak Djokovic in a marathon Australian Open final in January, but Nadal will pair up with fellow Spaniard Marc Lopez on Friday. Nadal, currently second in the world rankings, and Lopez, ranked 34th for doubles, won the event together in 2010 when they defeated Croat Nenad Zimonjic and Canada's Daniel Nestor in the final. ""My reason for playing doubles is that I didn't play for a month,"" Nadal told a press conference ahead of his and Lopez's match against Zimonjic and France's Michael Llodra. ""I think doubles is a good way to practice for everybody, where you can practice different movements, different shots. ""When you have days off [from singles], you can play an extra match. And if you lose, you have another chance to be in competition. At the same time, I'm playing with one of my best friends, so that's another reason to play."" Nadal's clash with Djokovic at Melbourne Park was the longest final in grand slam history, and he also suffered defeat to the Serb in the singles final at Indian Wells in 2011. Five-time grand slam champion Djokovic is top seed for the California event, with Nadal second. The 25-year-old is determined to keep improving his game so he can continue to challenge Djokovic for major honors. ""I try my best every day to improve my level of tennis, to be a better player, year by year. If that's enough to beat Novak, that's fantastic,"" he said. ""If not, I will keep on working. When I wake up every morning and go on court to practice, I don't think about [him]. I think about what I need to improve in my game.""

"Los Cabos, Mexico (CNN) -- President Barack Obama said Monday that he and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the conflict in Syria and ""agreed that we need to see a cessation of the violence, that a political process has to be created to prevent civil war."" In comments to reporters after almost two hours of talks, Obama said he and Putin had ""candid, thoughtful and thorough conversation"" about various issues including Syria and Iran. On Syria, Obama said he and Putin ""pledged to work with other international actors including the United Nations"" and its special envoy, former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan. Syria exposes cool spots in U.S.-Russia ties . Russia vetoed a U.N. resolution on Syria pushed by the United States and other allies, and Moscow is accused of providing military aid to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government. The Obama administration says al-Assad's days are numbered and a transition should be worked out to allow the Syrian people to choose their leaders. Putin said the two leaders were ""able to find many commonalities pertaining to all of those issues,"" but provided no details. The meeting on the sidelines of the G-20 Summit in Los Cabos, Mexico, was the first time Obama and Putin held face-to-face talks since Putin returned to the president's office earlier this year. The U.S. ambassador to Russia, Mike McFaul, described the leaders as ""very businesslike, cordial."" McFaul told reporters about a third of the session was devoted to Syria, making it the biggest single topic. ""The fact that the meeting went for two hours, that was because they were talking about Syria and they didn't want to stop talking about Syria,"" he said. ""Both leaders, really, on both sides, wanted to make sure the other side of the table understood the true motivations for what they're trying to do and what they're trying not to do."" Putin thanked the United States for helping Russia join the World Trade Organization last December. Obama later said he would work with Congress to strengthen Russia's trade status with the United States, adding that the two nations will disagree on some issues and must ""find constructive ways to manage through any bilateral tensions."" Earlier Monday, veteran Sen. John McCain said the Obama administration ""in its desperation"" appeared to be placing its hopes for a resolution in Syria on persuading Russia to push al-Assad from power. ""Russia is unlikely to ever support a policy of regime change in Syria,"" said McCain, R-Arizona, in remarks at the American Enterprise Institute. McCain calls for U.S. military leadership on Syria . White House National Security Council spokesman Ben Rhodes said Obama reiterated U.S. concerns that continued Russian arms sales to Syria ""only perpetuate the conflict"" during the meeting in Mexico. He said Putin repeated the Russian position that those sales were part of ""longstanding relationships unrelated to the current conflict"" -- and he cautioned reporters against reading too much into the terse statement Putin gave afterward. ""When he feels like it was a bad meeting, he'll let you know at some length,"" Rhodes said.","Iran and trade also are discussed by the two leaders .

"(CNN) -- They share the same surname -- Djokovic -- but for now at least, that is where the similarity ends. Novak is at the pinnacle of his sport and was the center of attention in Dubai after completing in his first victory since winning the Australian Open in January. At 20, Marko is four years younger, and 868 places further down the rankings -- and on Monday he slumped to an opening-round defeat in front of his elder sibling.

Del Potro too strong for Llodra in Marseille final . ""He has to face the pressure of having the Djokovic surname,"" Novak said in quotes carried by AFP. ""He's trying to fight with his mind more than with his game. When he is able to focus on that and not on his doubts he can become a world-class player."" He admitted it was tough to watch Marko's 6-3 6-2 reverse. ""It was difficult for me to sit courtside,"" he said. ""I have not done it too much. ""At least when I'm playing I know what's going on. But I was happy my brother got a wild card. He is not at his level yet, but he's getting there."" As for Marko, he said there were plenty of positives and negatives to being the brother of the world's No. 1 player. ""Financially, you know, I have all I need and can get the coaches and the right practice environment. But everybody expects you to be like your brother, which is really tough to achieve.

"Santa Monica, California (CNN) -- Santa Monica College officials in California have launched an investigation into a raucous student protest at a board of trustees meeting in which campus police used pepper spray on demonstrators, sending three of them to a hospital, the college president said Wednesday. The students weren't allowed into the overflowing meeting room Tuesday evening and were demonstrating in a hallway against a summer pilot program creating two tiers of tuition when the pepper spraying incident occurred, said Paul Alvarez Jr., the multimedia editor for the campus newspaper who videotaped the incident. Three people were taken to a hospital, and about 30 other students needed treatment for pepper spray, said Santa Monica Fire Department Capt. Judah Mitchell. The fire department set up a decontamination unit that consisted of a fire hose with clear water, Mitchell said. Santa Monica is a coastal city adjacent to Los Angeles. A number of the protesters ""engaged in unlawful conduct,"" such as setting off fire alarms, but campus police ""exercised restraint and made no arrests,"" college President Chui Tsang said in a statement. He said the protesters in the corridor chose not to enter an overflow room. In all, about 100 people protested the board meeting, he said. ""When some of these demonstrators used force to enter the board room proper, and had overrun the door and the personnel stationed at the door, there was one discharge of pepper spray used by a SMC police officer to preserve public and personal safety. Unfortunately, a number of bystanders, including college staff, students and other police personnel were affected,"" Tsang said. ""Santa Monica College regrets that a group of people chose to disrupt a public meeting in an unlawful manner,"" he added. In March, the the two-year college's board approved a summer session pilot program to self-fund extra courses in an effort to increase total classroom seats and provide a way for students to take courses they need, Tsang said. The program augments 700 regularly scheduled state-subsidized classes at $46 per credit unit for California residents, he said. About 50 extra self-funded classes will be offered at actual cost, which translates to $180 per credit unit, or $540 for a typical three-unit course, he said. That cost ""is far below the tuition rate at the state's other public educational systems,"" Tsang said. ""The college's action comes at a time when SMC is confronted with the greatest budget crisis ever to face higher education in California."" California has been grappling with a budget deficit that promises to result in massive cuts to higher education and course cancellations. Tuition for the California State University system rose 21% this year, to just over $9,000 for in-state residents. Gov. Jerry Brown's office has forecast a shortfall of $9.2 billion for the upcoming fiscal year, while state budget analysts warn the problem could be billions worse. Brown's budget for the 2013 fiscal year, which begins in July, includes more spending cuts, particularly to social services. If his plan to put a temporary tax increase before voters in November fails, education funding would be cut again. Two students who said they were pepper-sprayed described campus police as overreacting. ""Insanity. Overreaction. It started out just chanting and we're getting our point across,"" said Christine Deal, 20, who said an officer grabbed her neck. ""Things escalated with the campus police, and kids got pepper-sprayed and put in choke holds and thrown on the ground -- sent to the emergency room."" ""I think if they were going to pepper-spray that we should have been given some kind of warning,"" she added. Kayleigh Wade, 19, said she was protesting the summer tuition pricing because ""It's very classist."" ""It's making the classes divide, and it's going to cause more problems in the long run so it's preposterous to me that this is even being considered a solution,"" Wade said. She said the pepper spray incident, as well as the summer tuition plan, damages the school's reputation. ""It prides itself on being this diverse, progressive campus or whatever, and this completely stifles that reputation,"" Wade said. Alvarez, the student journalist at The Corsair campus newspaper, called the spraying incident an injustice. ""That made everything more chaotic than it should have been,"" Alvarez said. A 4-year-old girl was among those stung by the pepper spray, Alvarez said. CNN's Mary Snow contributed to this report.","""Insanity. Overreaction. It started out just chanting,"" one student says .

"(CNN) -- A tornado touched down late Friday afternoon in Norman, Oklahoma, bringing scattered structural damage and a taste of more severe weather -- including a tornado outbreak -- expected Saturday in the Plains. No serious injuries were immediately reported in Norman, home to the University of Oklahoma and the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center. Forecasters have said there is a ""high risk"" of severe thunderstorms on Saturday in portions of Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas and Oklahoma. iReport: Watch hail pound cars in Nebraska . A severe thunderstorm is defined by the National Weather Service as a thunderstorm that produces at least one or more of the following: winds of at least 58 mph, hail 1 inch in diameter and tornadoes. According to CNN meteorologist Sean Morris, ""high risk"" areas could possibly endure EF3 to EF5 tornadoes, packing winds of 136 mph or stronger. A tornado outbreak is likely across the central and southern plains from late Saturday afternoon through the evening and overnight, according to the National Weather Service. CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen said the Interstate 35 corridor -- from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, to Wichita, Kansas -- is a high-risk area. A second high-risk area includes portions of Iowa and Nebraska, where dangerous long-track tornadoes are also possible. Lincoln and Omaha might be affected. An elevated ""moderate"" threat extends from Iowa and Nebraska, southward into the tip of northern Texas. This includes Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Kansas City, Missouri.

"(CNN) -- The war itself lasted for less than three months. But 30 years on, wounds from the Falklands war are fresh, and Britain and Argentina are still at odds over the chilly, windswept island chain in the South Atlantic. Monday marks the 30th anniversary of the start of the war over the Falklands, which Argentina calls Las Malvinas. Britain won the 74-day war that began with an Argentine invasion attempt, but Argentina still presses claims to the islands, which are home to more than 3,000 people. ""Thirty years ago today, the people of the Falkland Islands suffered an act of aggression that sought to rob them of their freedom and their way of life. ... Today is a day for commemoration and reflection; a day to remember all those who lost their lives in the conflict,"" British Prime Minister David Cameron said to mark the day. ""We are rightly proud of the role Britain played in righting a profound wrong,"" he added. Argentina put its death toll from the conflict at around 645. Britain's civil and military losses amounted to 255. The war's anniversary provided an opening for leaders of the two nations to begin a new round of verbal sparring, which has erupted over the islands in the past several months -- with Prince William's six-week deployment to the islands in February and March as a high-profile backdrop. ""It is an injustice that in the 21st century there are still colonial enclaves like we have here, a few kilometers away,"" Argentinian President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner said in a speech in southern Argentina on Monday. She described claims that the Argentinian people were behind the 1982 war ""absurd"" and ""ridiculous,"" and called on British officials to begin negotiations over the islands, which have been under British rule since 1833. ""We want them to respect the law and the constitution of our country. This is not a story that started 30 years ago. It is going to be 180 years of usurpation,"" she added. British officials have dismissed calls for negotiations, arguing that the islands' residents have a right to decide their fate. ""It takes two to tango, and unfortunately, one of the two sides has been systematically refusing to start diplomatic negotiations,"" Argentinian Ambassador to the United States Jorge Arguello told CNN en EspaÃ±ol on Monday. Located in the South Atlantic Ocean, about 480 kilometers (298 miles) east of the tip of South America, the Falklands have long been coveted as a strategic shipping stopover and potential wellspring of natural resources. In February, Argentina complained to the United Nations about what it called Britain's militarization of the region. It had already banned Falklands ships from its ports, an action joined by other South American and Caribbean nations. The recent deployment of Prince William to the Falklands in his role as a Royal Air Force search-and-rescue pilot, as well as Britain's decision to send a new warship to the area, further fueled tensions. On Thursday, Argentina sent a letter to stock markets in London and New York telling them that companies exploring for oil near the islands risk criminal charges or civil liabilities. British Foreign Office Minister Jeremy Browne criticized Argentina Monday for being ""confrontational"" over the islands. ""I think it's a mistake for Argentina to be protectionist. I think it's a mistake for Argentina to start trade wars. I think it's a mistake for Argentina to have any sort of suggestion at all that they are considering coercing the people of the Falkland Islands into a political arrangement against their will,"" he told CNN. ""I think Argentina (is) making a number of political miscalculations, but obviously that's the choice that they're making. It's not a choice that we're making."" On Monday, the British military said the HMS Dauntless, a destroyer, will set sail Wednesday on a ""routine deployment"" to the South Atlantic, where it will relieve another ship in the region after months of preparation. ""We are now ready to provide a reassuring presence in the region and protect British interests,"" Capt. Will Warrender said in a statement. The Falklands, which raise their own taxes but rely on the United Kingdom for defense and foreign policy, are one of 14 British overseas territories and have been under British rule since 1833. Cameron has repeatedly said that it is up to the residents of the Falklands to determine their allegiance, and so far that support has been staunchly British. ""We support the Falklands' right to self-determination, and what the Argentinians have been saying recently I would argue is actually far more like colonialism, because these people want to remain British, and the Argentinians want them to do something else,"" he told lawmakers this year. CNN's Glenda Umana, Marilia Brocchetto, Zain Verjee and Rafael Romo contributed to this report.","NEW: The British foreign office minister criticizes Argentina's ""miscalculations""

"(CNN) -- Reese Witherspoon's mother wants a Tennessee judge to annul her husband's recent marriage because she says she is still married to him, according to court documents. ""I love my husband and do not want a divorce,"" Mary Elizabeth Witherspoon said in a sworn affidavit. ""We have been married for 42 years. He needs help."" The couple separated in 1996 ""because of his alcoholism, infidelity, overspending and hoarding,"" she said. Witherspoon, who said she speaks to her husband of 42 years ""many times per week,"" learned through a Nashville newspaper announcement last month that John Witherspoon married ""a woman named Tricianne Taylor"" on January 14, the annulment petition said. Witherspoon, 63, said her husband, 70, denied getting remarried, but a marriage license was filed, the petition said. ""When I confronted my husband, he said he didn't know who Tricianne Taylor was and that he did not remember getting married,"" she said. ""I fear that he has early onset dementia,"" Witherspoon, who is a retired nurse, said in her petition, which was filed Wednesday. The court filing claims that Tricianne Taylor, also known as Patricia Taylor, is aware that he is still married because the first wife told her on April 30. ""She refused to talk to me,"" Witherspoon said in her affidavit. ""I also wrote her a letter stating that John Witherspoon was married and had two children and four grandchildren. I have had no response. But she clearly knows now that she is married to a man who is not divorced."" Witherspoon raised concern that her husband is in danger. ""My husband is diabetic, has heart disease, and is otherwise not in good health,"" she said in her filing. ""He could easily die through lack of medicine, or too much medicine, or some other malicious act."" He was recently ""let go from his medical practice"" in Nashville, where he worked as an otolaryngologist for 30 years, she said in the affidavit. The first Mrs. Witherspoon has a harsh assessment of Taylor. ""My husband's spending practices have accelerated,"" Witherspoon said in her statement. ""I now understand that he may have borrowed $400,000 at Bank of America and either forged my name or had his girlfriend posing as his wife sign. This past week he bought a black Cadillac."" Taylor ""attempted to crash the March 2011 wedding of Reese Witherspoon, but was denied entrance because she was not on the guest list,"" the petition said. ""I have since learned from friends and investigators that Tricianne Taylor has attempted to borrow money as Ms. John Witherspoon,"" her affidavit said. ""Also, she is living in the condominium owned by my daughter Reese. And she is driving our vehicles. I have also learned through an investigator that she has gotten my husband to sign a new will."" Reese Witherspoon's representative said ""no comment"" when CNN asked about the case. CNN has been unable to contact John Witherspoon or Taylor for comment. Court filings do not identify their legal counsel.","Mary Elizabeth Witherspoon: She learned of her husband's marriage in a newspaper .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The withdrawal of one of two massage therapists from a sex battery lawsuit against John Travolta ""completely vindicated"" the actor, Travolta's lawyer said Tuesday. The lawyer representing the therapists filed papers Tuesday dropping the client identified as John Doe #1 because he had misstated the date of the alleged incident at the Beverly Hills Hotel. ""We fully expect that my client will similarly be vindicated with respect to Doe #2, as well as with respect to any other person who makes meritless claims against John Travolta,"" attorney Martin Singer said. The remaining plaintiff claims Travolta groped him during a massage at an Atlanta hotel last January. ""I can guarantee that John Doe #2 has a truckload of witnesses to back up what he's saying,"" plaintiff's attorney Okorie Okarocha told CNN Tuesday. Strauss-Kahn countersues maid for at least $1 million . His case is also bolstered by a series of e-mails in which the Atlanta plaintiff complains to his supervisor about Travolta's advances, Okarocha said. Singer attacked one e-mail published in some online reports that purportedly supports the Doe #2 claims. ""Various media outlets are reporting on an e-mail that Doe #2 allegedly sent to his bosses, which significantly does not refer to my client at all, nor does it make any mention whatsoever of any of the things outrageously alleged in Doe #2's lawsuit,"" Singer said. ""Instead, Doe #2 voiced complaints about his co-workers gossiping and being insubordinate."" The e-mail's lack of Travolta's name ""says it all,"" Singer said. ""Nothing that is alleged in Doe #2's lawsuit was mentioned in the e-mail he sent to his bosses, making his claims even more unbelievable."" ""The allegations in 'Doe #2's' lawsuit are unraveling, just like 'Doe #1's' ridiculous allegations, which were proven false and impossible,"" he said. Two men accuse Travolta of sexual battery in lawsuit . Okarocha, however, vowed that he would ""mop up"" in the courtroom with the witnesses and documents against Travolta. ""I think I can show a custom, habit and practice,"" Okarocha said, referring to his allegation that the actor has sexually assaulted dozens of other massage therapists over the years. ""If I bring in 100 people that don't have an ax to grind, don't want any money, they're in 50 different states, they don't know each other, they're all massage therapists, they all have dates, they're at different spa resorts and they say this exact same thing happened, it's pretty hard to refute,"" Okarocha said. His client ""ain't going nowhere,"" and is looking forward to a trial, he said. ""He means business and he is absolutely determined and he's as solid as they come as when it comes to character, history, reputation,"" Okarocha said. ""He's everything you would want in a client."" Okarocha apologized last Friday for putting the wrong date of the John Doe #1 incident in the lawsuit, saying his first client initially told him it was January 16, 2012. Singer produced a restaurant receipt and a time-stamped photograph that showed the actor was in New York, not Los Angeles, on that date. Plaintiff's attorney apologizes about error in sex lawsuit . Instead of just changing the date on the filing to January 15 -- the day John Doe #1 later decided was when it happened -- Okarocha decided to withdraw the allegation from the lawsuit. Otherwise, it would have hampered the chances of John Doe #2's case, he said. Okarocha also said he had ""personality conflicts"" with John Doe #1 that contributed to his decision. The second plaintiff was a staff massage therapist at the Atlanta hotel where he claims he was assaulted by Travolta on January 25, the amended lawsuit said. Travolta, 58, has been married to actress Kelly Preston for 20 years. The oldest of their three children, Jett, was 16 when he died of a seizure while the family was vacationing in the Bahamas in January 2009. CNN's Kareen Wynter contributed to this report.","John Doe #1 withdraws from the suit; he misstated the date of the alleged incident .

"(CNN) -- A fully integrated Apple television, one of Steve Jobs' final visions, might be on the way soon, according to multiple reports. In ""Steve Jobs,"" a biography of the late Apple co-founder released Monday, author Walter Isaacson writes that Jobs told him he'd finally figured out a way to make a TV practical. He said it would wirelessly synch with other Apple devices. ""It will have the simplest user interface you could imagine,"" he told Isaacson. ""I finally cracked it."" On the same day, analyst Brian White of Ticonderoga Securities issued a report titled ""A Full-Blown Apple TV Is On The Way."" In it, he says the book confirms what his multiple trips to China have suggested. He said Ticonderoga has seen evidence that early stage prototypes of an ""Apple Smart TV"" are already making their way through Chinese factories. ""We believe a product could hit the market in the coming quarters, opening up a new growth category for Apple and driving sales of existing products that play into the Apple digital ecosystem,"" White wrote. On Tuesday, Bloomberg cited three unnamed sources saying that Jeff Robbin, the software engineer who built iTunes, is in charge of developing the television set. The news service quoted another analyst, Gene Munster, of Piper Jaffray Cos., saying that the iPhone 4S's Siri voice-command app could be integrated into a TV system. Since 2007, the company has made a product called Apple TV, a set-top Web-streaming box that competes with rival Google TV and independent offerings like Roku and Boxee. But compared to hits like the iPhone and iPad, it has largely underperformed, leading Jobs last year to acknowledge that Apple TV has ""never been a huge hit."" In September, Apple slashed its price from $299 to $99, but even that hasn't made the service a household name. In his report, White notes that a refresh of Apple TV set for later this year has been scrapped, potentially signaling the television system's pending arrival.","Reports: A ""full-blown"" Apple television is on the way .

"(CNN) -- World No. 2 Rafael Nadal is still on course for his first Miami Masters title after beating the Czech Republic's Radek Stepanek 6-2 6-2 in the third round of the U.S. hard-court tournament. Spain's 10-time grand slam winner has been runner-up at the event on three occasions, including last year when he lost to Novak Djokovic, who went on to dethrone him at the top of the rankings. Nadal took just 87 minutes to record a sixth consecutive win over 25th seed Stepanek on Sunday, setting up a clash with No. 16 Kei Nishikori -- who also beat Czech opposition in the shape of Lukas Rosol. ""He's a fantastic player and it will be a very difficult match for me,"" Nadal said of Japan's 22-year-old rising star. ""He has a big talent to hit the ball very early, to play very aggressive. So he will be a really tough opponent."" World No. 4 Andy Murray reached the last 16 without hitting a ball, after his in-form third-round opponent Milos Raonic was forced to pull out due to an ankle injury in Key Biscayne. ""The doctor doesn't think it's anything big. It probably just needs a couple days of rest and, with treatment, it should be OK in a week,"" said the Canadian, who has already won titles in Chennai and San Jose this year. Murray will now face Gilles Simon for a place in the quarterfinals after the French 13th seed won 7-6 6-4 against Austrian 22nd seed Jurgen Melzer. In other third-round matches, seventh-seeded Czech Tomas Berdych slumped to a shock 6-3 2-6 6-4 defeat by Grigor Dimitrov, who beat a top-10 player for the first time in his career. The Bulgarian next faces Serbian ninth seed Janko Tipsarevic, who saw off Ukrainian No. 18 Alexandr Dolgopolov 6-4 5-7 6-2. French sixth seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga defeated No. 32 Philipp Kohlschreiber 6-4 7-6, and will next face another German -- No. 19 Florian Mayer. The winner of that match will face Nadal or Nishikori. In the women's section, the unseeded Venus Williams, who was handed a wildcard to compete in Florida, is also through to the last 16. The American, who was diagnosed with the incurable Sjogren's syndrome before the 2011 U.S. Open, was made to battle hard before defeating Canadian Aleksandra Wozniak 4-6 6-4 7-6. She next faces fellow former world No. 1 Ana Ivanovic. The Serbian 15th seed overcame Slovakia's No. 20 Daniela Hantuchova 6-2 7-6 (7-2). World No. 1 Victoria Azarenka, the defending champion, thrashed British wildcard Heather Watson 6-0 6-2. The Australian Open champion will play No.16 Dominika Cibulkova after the Slovakian beat China's Zheng Jie. Polish fifth seed Agnieszka Radwanska set up a clash with Spanish wildcard Garbine Muguruza Blanc, who shocked Italy's No. 24 Flavia Pennetta 6-2 1-6 7-6. French seventh seed Marion Bartoli will face Russia's No. 22 Maria Kirilenko in the last 16 after both won comfortably.","Second seed Rafael Nadal through to the fourth round of Miami Masters .

"(CNN) -- Mary Kennedy, from whom Robert F. Kennedy Jr. filed for divorce in 2010, is dead, an employee of the Westchester County, New York, medical examiner's office said Wednesday. Mary Kennedy's funeral set for Saturday . The employee, who declined to give his name, told CNN he would provide no further details about the manner and cause of death. Kennedy was 52. The family released a statement saying, ""We deeply regret the death of our beloved sister Mary, whose radiant and creative spirit will be sorely missed by those who loved her. Our heart goes out to her children who she loved without reservation."" Mary Kennedy's family blasts stories on her death . The Bedford Police Department earlier confirmed they were investigating a possible unattended death at an address owned by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Authorities found a deceased individual inside ""an out building"" on the property, police said in a statement. Regarding her marital status at the time of her death, Mary Kennedy wasn't divorced from Robert F. Kennedy Jr., her family attorney, Kerry A. Lawrence, told CNN. Mary Richardson Kennedy was ""a tremendously gifted architect and a pioneer and relentless advocate of green design who enhanced her cutting edge, energy efficient creations with exquisite taste and style,"" Robert F. Kennedy's family said in a statement. Mary Kennedy: 'Green' designer, wife of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. She advocated finding a cure for food allergies and asthma and was a co-founder of the Food Allergy Initiative, which is the world's largest private source of funding for food allergy research, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s family said. ""It is with deep sadness that the family of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. mourns the loss of Mary Richardson Kennedy, wife and mother of their four beloved children. Mary inspired our family with her kindness, her love, her gentle soul and generous spirit,"" the husband's family's statement said. The couple married in civil ceremony in 1994 when Mary Richardson, a designer, was six months pregnant, according to the Westchester County Journal News. One month prior to the wedding, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. divorced his first wife, Emily Black, the mother of his two oldest children, the newspaper reported. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent environmental lawyer who's a professor at Pace Law School in White Plains, New York, is the third of 11 children born to Ethel and Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, who was assassinated when campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1968. Details of the couple's private lives were exposed after Robert F. Kennedy Jr. filed for divorce in Westchester County on May 12, 2010. The next evening, according to police records, Bedford police responded to a 911 call. When police arrived at the Kennedy residence they found the couple in an argument over taking their four children to a carnival at St. Patrick's School. According to a ""domestic incident"" report filed by the officer on the scene, ""Mr. Kennedy stated that his wife was intoxicated and was acting irrational so he took the children to the carnival to remove them from the situation."" No one was injured, the report said. Two days later, Mary Kennedy was arrested for driving while intoxicated. At the time, Bedford Police Lt. Jeff Dickans told CNN that Mary Kennedy was arrested around 9:15 p.m. on May 15, 2010. Dickans said that a Bedford police officer saw Kennedy's 2004 Volvo swerving onto the curb of Greenwich Road in Bedford and asked her to pull over. Kennedy had slurred speech, and a blood-alcohol content above 0.08 percent, the legal limit in New York. She was charged with driving while intoxicated. Kerry Lawrence, Mary Kennedy's family attorney, said the case resulted in a reduction to a violation, the criminal charge was dismissed and her driver's license was suspended for 90 days. A second arrest occured in August of the same year in the town of Pleasant Valley, in which she was charged with driving while impaired by prescription drugs, Lawrence said. Those charges were dismissed completely in July 2011 because all the drugs were prescribed and taken as her physician advised, the attorney said. As a designer, Mary Kennedy specialized in green architecture, and in a book entitled ""Kennedy Green House"" and co-authored by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., he describes how he and his wife restored their flooded, black-mold-infested home into an eco-friendly residence. In the book, her husband wrote that Mary Kennedy had worked for the design firm Parish-Hadley and worked on the renovation of the Naval Observatory in Washington, the official residence of the U.S. vice president. ""We know from a history of this family, it's very hard being a Kennedy, either being a blood Kennedy or being married to one,"" Laurence Leamer, a Kennedy biographer, told CNN.","NEW: She was ""a pioneer and relentless advocate of green design,"" RFK Jr.'s family says .

"Washington (CNN) -- With 30-plus governments since independence (average length less than two years), Israeli politics rarely surprises. But Monday's agreement between Benjamin Netanyahu and Kadima leader Shaul Mofaz did precisely that. In a pre-emptive strike -- against his critics, a cynical Israeli press, and, last but not least, an American administration that keeps hoping he's a short-timer -- Netanyahu bought himself another 16 months of challenge-free politics, co-opted his main opponent for the price of a deputy premiership, and broadened and legitimized his government for the turbulent period ahead. While Mofaz looks unprincipled (two weeks ago he said he'd never join a Netanyahu-led coalition), Bibi Netanyahu looks like a veritable statesman and political genius who, for the sake of the country's unity and stability, did the right thing. With U.S. President Barack Obama facing an uncertain political future, Netanyahu has secured his -- at least over the short term. What difference will the new coalition of 94 Knesset members -- a virtually unassailable majority -- have on the core issues facing Israel? Peace process: Already comatose, the Israeli-Palestinian issue may be revived slightly as a result of the new politics. Mofaz has made resolution of the Palestinian issue a key theme; but the result will be motion without real movement. Since Mofaz is committed to pursuing the existing government's policies until the end of 2013, it's unlikely there will be major changes. Netanyahu didn't invite Kadima into the coalition only to go to new elections over a deal with the Palestinians that could split his own Likud party. But the change in tone will relieve the pressure of being saddled with a right-wing government that many claimed had no constituent group which was at all interested in negotiations. Iran: Some analysts argue that early elections would have reduced the chances for an Israeli strike against Iranian nuclear sites, and that the unity government has now increased them. That's what Netanyahu would like to make the world believe. But Netanyahu's decision-making on striking Iran has always been shaped by three factors; the unity government changes none of them. In fact, given Mofaz's caution on Iran, the odds of a strike before the American elections may actually be reduced. First, there's Netanyahu's read of Iran's intentions. That hasn't changed. Netanyahu believes the mullahs want the capacity to produce a nuclear weapon and ultimately to possess the weapon itself. The P5+1 international talks on Iran, in Istanbul last month and later this month in Baghdad, haven't persuaded him otherwise; but they do make an attack much less likely while the process is in train. Second, there's the degree of difficulty of the operation. Israel would like to avoid a unilateral strike and make Iran America's problem. Without firing a shot in the past year or so, the Israelis are well on their way to success here. And Mofaz will reinforce this approach now that his bloc of 28 Kadima Knesset members is part of the coalition. Finally, what America thinks is critical to Israeli calculations. Should the Israelis strike, the United States needs to be in their corner to deal with the mess afterward. And Obama has made it as clear as any American president can that Israel acting now, with negotiations ongoing, is a bad idea. Clearly, Obama doesn't want an Israeli strike or an American strike before the elections and probably not this year. And the new unity government reinforces the obvious: no war with Iran in 2012 and likely no deal on the nuclear issue either. This new government in Israel isn't about upsetting the status quo and getting ready for war; on the contrary, it's about preserving the status quo -- at least for now. Netanyahu thinks of himself in historic and potentially transformative terms -- leading Israel at a moment of great challenge, particularly freeing the Israelis from the shadow of the Iranian bomb. We're constantly underestimating him. Obama thinks he's a con man, or at best a speed bump confronting a peace process he'd like to see move forward. The Europeans would like him gone -- yesterday. The Palestinians and the Arabs can't stand him. But the fact is, for now Netanyahu is the only Israeli political leader that can do and have it all -- maintain close ties with Washington; settle the West Bank; avoid negotiations with the Palestinians; use the threat of an Israeli attack to keep the international community pressing Iran; and now, dominate Israeli politics. He's the king of Israel, and we may just have to get used to it. Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion.

The Galaxy S III would be the successor to the Galaxy S II, which was never a single phone, but rather a lineup of devices with varying internal specs and exterior designs for different countries and carriers. Shoot, even the S II's display sizes varied, with both 4.3-inch and 4.5-inch screens. And while the Galaxy S II has been the flagship Samsung Android device for AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile, the nation's largest carrier, Verizon, has avoided the S II altogether. Instead, Verizon has gone all-in with the Samsung Galaxy Nexus, the first handset to boast the Android 4.0 operating system. By all accounts, the Galaxy Nexus is currently Samsung's best Android phone, its single-carrier limitation notwithstanding. But what will happen when the Galaxy S III is released? This question, too, is complicated by the 5.3-inch Galaxy Note, which has been a surprise hit for Samsung. More than 5 million Galaxy Note units have shipped worldwide -- and this is a phone that runs on the horribly antiquated Android 2.3 (Gingerbread). With Samsung making so many phones for different markets, carriers and countries, it's difficult to figure out just where the Galaxy S III will reside in Samsung's line-up, says Ross Rubin, executive director of the NPD Group market research firm. ""Samsung is producing a number of of high-end smartphones with leading-edge specs and, yes, that does make it tough to figure out which one their flagship phone is,"" Rubin told Wired. ""But Samsung is one of the few companies out there that can make a lot of different phones with different functionality, geared toward different markets, that can all be considered flagship phones somewhere."" Regardless, when the Galaxy S III is unveiled, the smartphone will be worthy of flagship status for at least a few carriers, Rubin said. ""The idea behind the Galaxy Nexus is to provide a pure Google Android experience,"" he said. ""The Galaxy Note, which has the largest screen size of any handset in a major U.S. carrier portfolio, is clearly about maximum screen real estate and the S-Pen for notes, annotation and drawing. Each device has its trade offs and Samsung is trying to have something out there for most anyone."" Rubin says the Galaxy S and S II have been about reaching as many consumers as possible, and the S III will likely be that type of phone as well, Rubin said. ""The reason there are so many versions of the Galaxy S II, and the Galaxy S before it, is because the Galaxy S line is about establishing a high-end baseline and having broad carrier reach,"" he said. ""The whole point is to sell as many of those phones as possible, so what they're going for is top-of-the-line specs, but also mainstream consumer needs."" Carolina Milanesi, a Gartner analyst, says Samsung should be less worried about where the S III lives in its broader line-up than how it stacks up against the S II, which hit U.S. shores last fall. Conventional wisdom says the Galaxy S III will have a 4.7-inch screen, quad-core processor, an 8+MP camera, 4G connectivity and (of course) a custom, Samsung-skinned version of Android 4.0. The Galaxy S II had almost-as-large screens, a dual-core processor, an 8-megapixel rear camera, and 4G data support. ""If the Galaxy S III is just like the Galaxy S II, but with slightly better specifications, then I think Samsung will have a tough time selling it as differentiated product,"" Milanesi said. ""If that's what Samsung releases, the question will be, Can Samsung do what Apple does so well, with a refresh of an existing phone?"" She makes a compelling point: When you compare the iPhone 4 to the iPhone 4S, Apple's hardware specs are remarkably similar. In effect, Apple's most successful phone launch ever was built on the back of an extra CPU core, an improved camera, and a clever voice-recognition system with natural language comprehension (Siri). ""Samsung's brand is not Apple-strong yet,"" Milanesi said. ""I don't know if Samsung will ever reach that emotional level for the brand from the consumer standpoint. And that's what makes this question of 'Will the Galaxy S III be a big flagship phone?' so tricky. The Galaxy S II already has what most consumers are looking for from an Android phone."" Samsung's best chance at making the Galaxy S III a success would be introducing a ground-breaking new technology, she said. ""I don't think phones can get that much thinner, and I don't think they need to get much bigger,"" Milanesi said. ""If Samsung can release a phone with a flexible display, something they've been experimenting with for awhile now, then they'd be far ahead of the curve. If they don't do something like that, they might have a hard time getting enough people to see the Galaxy S III as a truly differentiated product.""

"(CNN) -- The judge in the murder case of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin has denied a prosecution's motion for a gag order, but noted the court could reconsider if attorneys in the case write or say anything considered prejudicial. ""At this time, there is no demonstrated need to restrict free speech,"" Seminole County Circuit Judge Kenneth R. Lester wrote. The decision -- which was made public Tuesday -- rejects, among other things, prosecutor concerns over a lack of juror impartiality due to the amount of media coverage surrounding the high-profile case. ""The case should be tried in the courtroom and not in the media,"" the motion read in its petition for a gag order. But Lester wrote that the attorneys had so far represented ""the utmost in professionalism in their public statements,"" and ruled against the motion. George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch volunteer accused of wrongly killing Martin on February 26, was released last week on $150,000 bail, 10% of which was put up to secure his release while he awaits trial on a second-degree murder charge. Zimmerman was arrested April 11 after a lengthy delay punctuated by protests and rallies nationwide calling for charges against him. Critics have accused him of racially profiling and unjustly killing Martin, though Zimmerman told police that he shot Martin in self-defense. Although details of the shooting remain murky, both sides agree that Martin ventured out from the Sanford, Florida, home of his father's fiancee and went to a nearby convenience store, where he bought a bag of candy and an iced tea. On his way back, he had a confrontation with Zimmerman, who shot him. Zimmerman had called 911 to complain about a suspicious person in the neighborhood, according to authorities. In the call, Zimmerman said he was following Martin after the teen started to run, prompting the dispatcher to tell him, ""We don't need you to do that."" Zimmerman apparently disregarded that advice, but then said he lost sight of Trayvon.","The judge has denied a prosecution's motion for a gag order .

"London (CNN) -- Brazil stands at a crossroads in its efforts to preserve the Amazon rainforest, as the government considers controversial legislation governing land use. For most of the last decade it has made a dramatic reduction in the rate of deforestation -- providing a model of how it could be tackled in other rainforest areas such as Indonesia and Congo. The Amazon rainforest covers a huge area, roughly half as large as the United States, with around 60% of it in Brazil. It is estimated that nearly a fifth of the Brazilian forest has been lost since 1970 -- figures from Brazil's space research institute (INPE) show that 4.1 million square kilometers (1.58 million square miles) of Brazilian forest were still standing in 1970 compared to 3.35 million square kilometers (1.29 million square miles) today. Like many developing nations, there is pressure on the natural environment from commercial and agriculture interests. According to INPE, in 1995 nearly 30,000 square kilometers (about 11,550 square miles) were cleared -- that is an area about the size of Belgium or the U.S. state of Maryland -- but in 2011 the rate of loss had been reduced to just over 6,000 square kilometers (about 2,400 square miles). Last year saw the lowest annual clearance since yearly INPE surveys began in 1988 and Brazil is aiming to reduce deforestation even further to 3,500 square kilometres annually by 2020. See interactive maps of Brazil's land use . Brazil's environment ministry credits its success on a combination of support for sustainable activities and near real-time satellite monitoring of forest regions that allows it to target illegal operations with extra agents. But environmentalists worry that these results -- brought about by efficient use of technology allied with a political will to slow clearing -- could now be put at risk by an overhaul of Brazil's Forest Code. Protesters say the new code, which could come into effect after a much-delayed crucial vote, reduces protection and weakens enforcement laws. ""The changes in the new Forest Code will reduce this protection. Combined with the strong presence of 'ruralists' in the Congress -- congressmen linked to the agri-business sector -- there is good reason to be very concerned for the future of forests in Brazil,"" said Jessica Miller of Greenpeace Brazil. ""Deforestation in the Amazon has many drivers. Loggers come first to take the most precious timber and finance the building of rough, illegal roads. Then come cattle ranchers, burning what is left and planting grass. Cattle ranching is often used to guarantee the ownership of the area by land grabbers,"" she said. At present, Brazilian government statistics show that about 30% of the country's land is given over to agriculture. The power of the rural lobby is acknowledged by those close to the Brazilian government but the environmental fears are also rejected. Luis Antonio Carvalho, special advisor to the Brazilian Environment Minister, Izabella Teixeira, said: ""It is true that the rural caucus representatives have much power, everybody knows that. Much of the GDP comes from the Brazilian agriculture and livestock. It is a sector of great importance for the country. ""The new proposal includes all the government's requirements. It sets out regulations to restore the land. It includes components such as social interest, public utilities and low environmental impact. ""But I think this is the best proposal that can come out for both sides. Environmental groups are concerned, but the rural caucus, on the other hand, are worried too. So it is clear that neither side will be satisfied with any code that the government approves."" Carvalho said farmers must keep 80% of their forested land -- they will only be able to clear 20% -- and may have to use some of their land for reforestation. But farmers are worried about the future of their businesses and keen to modernize the existing code, which dates to 1965. No-one from the Brazilian farmers' body, the CNA, which represents 2,300 rural trade unions, was available for comment but the group's website calls for a balanced approach that safeguards conservation and food production ""because this production depends on the welfare and progress of the Brazilians."" Protecting the rainforest has attracted celebrity backing for more than two decades. The pop singer, Sting, and his wife Trudie Styler, set up the Rainforest Foundation in 1989 after seeing the destruction of the Amazon rainforest and its impact on indigenous peoples. Both the Rainforest Foundation and Greenpeace have previously urged Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff to use her veto to block the law change. They are concerned about the threat to the huge range of animals and plants found in the world's rainforests -- scientists from the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity estimate that at least two thirds of all Earth's terrestrial species are found in tropical forests. Spring 2012 also marks a significant junction half a world away in Indonesia which has significant forest areas. In May 2010 Norway signed a letter of intent, pledging around $1 billion to help Indonesia reduce deforestation. But there have been delays in implementing the plan and Greenpeace says it is not working. The agreement was designed to help Indonesia with its commitment to the U.N.'s global REDD+ program (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation). It called for the establishment of an ""independent institution for a national monitoring, reporting and verification system,"" a two-year moratorium on all new concessions for forest clearance and enforcement of laws on illegal logging. Rainforest home to vast treasury of life . Central Kalimantan was chosen as a pilot project -- an area of Indonesia that has seen widespread forest destruction. Studies by South Dakota State University and the environmental think tank, World Resources Institute (WRI), show that the lowlands of Kalimantan and Sumatra have lost more than 40% of the rainforest cover since 1990. In the same period, more than 17% of Indonesia's total forest area has disappeared. The studies also show there has been a resurgence in clearing since 2000, but has not so far reached the levels of the 1990s. Attempts to halt deforestation in Indonesia are much less advanced than Brazil which started its drive in the 1980s. Greenpeace says there are major loopholes in the Indonesian moratorium, saying the safeguards are inadequate with no review of existing concessions, and criticizes the lack of a good monitoring system. ""In short, in our opinion and analysis, the moratorium has not been working well in halting deforestation in Indonesia,"" said Yuyun Indradi, Greenpeace forest campaigner in Indonesia. ""The land rights issues are also a major problem in forest governance... creating more and more conflict and human rights violations. It means the existence of indigenous peoples and local peoples are at risk as, currently, the government tends to give more priority to the large scale industries of forestry, plantation and mining,"" he said. The Indonesia government insists it is committed to REDD+ and introducing a host of measures to slow deforestation and reduce emissions. In a keynote environment speech in September 2011, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono dedicated his remaining three years in office to enhance the forests of Indonesia. ""We must attain both development and the management of our forest -- simultaneously,"" he said. ""This is because forest management is tightly intertwined with the livelihood of our people, with our food security, with the availability of wood and fuel. ""Apart from the moratorium, we have built indicative maps that are important to the implementation of REDD+. These maps will also facilitate the resolution of decades-long problems of land use and land tenure."" A spokesman for the Indonesian government adds that they are working on the maps and new concessions permits, and to determine the extent of forest damage and how to control it. But can Indonesia match the progress made by Brazil? Greenpeace's Indradi says Brazil's strong point has been to implement better forest governance, backed up with good monitoring and serious law enforcement. It is the monitoring issue that is also acknowledged as key by the WRI. ""Reliable monitoring and information are essential for protecting forests,"" said the institute's Fred Stolle. ""Indonesia recognizes the value of good data and is working to develop such a system. ""What the world really needs is consistent, real-time deforestation data for all forested countries."" Sofia Fernandes contributed to this report .","Brazil has made a dramatic reduction in the rate of deforestation .

"(CNN) -- Martin Skrtel's early own goal gave Fulham a historic first win at Anfield on Tuesday and left Liverpool in danger of finishing outside the top eight in the English top flight for the first time since 1954. With Saturday's FA Cup final against Chelsea in mind, Reds manager Kenny Dalglish rested a host of first-choice players, including Luis Suarez, Steven Gerrard and goalkeeper Pepe Reina. The home side made the worst possible start when Skrtel headed in former Liverpool defender John Arne Riise's cross, and couldn't recover against a Fulham team that had won only three previous away games this season. The London club moved level on points with eighth-placed Liverpool, while Everton edged closer to finishing above their Merseyside rivals for the first time in seven years with a 1-1 draw at Stoke. An own goal by Stoke striker Peter Crouch -- the 1,000th goal of this Premier League season -- gave Everton the lead after 44 minutes before fellow forward Cameron Jerome came off the bench to snatch a point in the 69th minute. Everton lost to Liverpool in the FA Cup semifinals, but the draw left David Moyes' side three points above the Reds with two league games to play. Liverpool were booed off by their home fans, having won three of the last 13 league games and only five times at home in the Premier League all season. ""Our attitude wasn't right, and if you go in with a bad attitude you're going to get a bad performance,"" said Dalglish, whose team won the English League Cup in February. In La Liga on Tuesday, Villarreal secured a vital 3-2 win at Sporting Gijon that moved them closer to safety and all but condemned the opposition to the second division. Marcos Senna put the visitors 2-1 up from the penalty spot just before half time and Hernan Perez added a third in the 56th minute before a late consolation from Alejandro Galvez. The end of the game was marred by the home fans throwing objects onto the pitch as they saw their team slump to a loss that leaves them needing to win their last two games and hope Rayo Vallecano lose both theirs. Villarreal will be safe if Zaragoza do not beat Levante on Wednesday, as will Granada who beat Espanyol 2-1 thanks to a first-half double by Nigerian striker Odion Ighalo. Getafe could only draw 1-1 at home to relegated Racing Santander to damage their chances of qualifying for the Europa League. In Serie A, Roma seem destined to miss out on Champions League qualification after playing out a 0-0 draw in torrential rain at Chievo. If they are to finish third, Roma need to win their last two games and hope neither Napoli, Lazio, Inter Milan nor Udinese take more than three points from their final three matches.","Fulham beat Liverpool 1-0 for the first ever win at Anfield .

"(CNN) -- Just as there are many choices of drivers, putters, balls, and other equipment; there are just as many choices of golf instructors. Choosing the right golf instructor can help improve your game. The process of how you choose your golf instructor is as unique as your finger prints. However, just like there are certain things you want to know before choosing your doctor, there are certain items you should inquire of your instructor. Compatibility - It is your responsibility to insure that there is a fit between you and your instructor on all levels, personality type, mutual goals, similar outlooks on the game, and your instructor's ability to relate to your individual needs. Before throwing a dart in the phone book under ""golf instruction"", research the professionals in your area. One way is to ask friends and playing partners for referrals of good instructors in your area. Ask them about pricing, reputation, location, and their improvement under the instructor's tutelage. If you get along with your playing partners and the instructor does too, odds are you have found a fit. Then, call the instructor and ask if they have time to talk to you about your game and improvement goals. A good instructor will be happy to talk to you about your game, and get to know you as an individual, prior to helping you with your golf game. Accreditation and Experience - Does your golf instructor have the education and experience to take your game to any level you desire? Many individuals claim to be golf instructors. Many of these individuals are self-proclaimed ""experts,"" or had enough money to take a one to two week course on how to teach golf and make more money. In seeking a golf professional to help you with your game, insure that the individual has an active accreditation with the PGA or LPGA, or, has demonstrated an inarguable ability to help players of many levels improve through many years of practice. Other associations claim they produce golf instructors. However, these organizations have one focus, to make money, not to produce solid golf instructors. Inquire of your instructor their accreditation, as well as their education both on and off the golf course. Check with the LPGA or PGA websites to confirm your potential golf instructor's accreditation with that organization, and, how much experience the instructor possesses. Inquire of the instructor's philosophy and past success stories. If needed, ask for references of students from all skill levels that you can contact. Video - Video swing analysis has become a staple for all golf instruction. It is no longer an option. If you are paying for instruction that does not include video review of your game, you should reconsider why you are paying for golf instruction. Video, when used correctly, is a third pair of eyes (you and your instructor are first and second). This is similar to a doctor using an X-Ray or M.R.I, to diagnosis a health issue. Your golf instructor should be using video in the same manner. Video should confirm the diagnosis to you, not the instructor. A good golf instructor has the ability to see the flaw first, and use his or her knowledge of that flaw to diagnose a cure or drill for you to practice to realize improvement. If your golf instructor is relying solely on video to tell what is happening in your swing, you will eventually lose trust in the instructor's ability to help you. You would second guess a doctor's ability to help you if he or she did not use their ability first and confirm their thoughts with tests. Then why would you rely on an instructor who is not ""practicing"" golf instruction in the same manner? Follow-up Communication - Your golf instructor should have a program available for you to utilize to ask questions, give feedback, receive follow-up instructions, schedule lessons, or make other inquiries after your lesson. Some instructors offer their phone numbers after hours. Others utilize the internet for follow-up and communication purposes. Regardless of what form of communication is available to you after the lesson, your instructor should be available, at no extra charge, within a reasonable amount of time, to answer your questions and take interest in your concerns.","Handy hints from the PGA to help secure the right golf coach for your game .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Overcrowding inside a cathedral where Coptic Christians had gathered to pay last respects to their pope caused a stampede that left three people dead and more than 50 injured, a health official said. Coptic Pope Shenouda III, who led the Coptic community for more than four decades, died Saturday. He was 88. On Sunday, thousands of Christians paid their respects to him at the Coptic cathedral in Cairo where his body went on display in an elaborate golden crown and red and golden robes. The mass of people inside the cathedral prompted the stampede, according to Deputy Health Minister Hisham Sheeha, who said three were killed and 52 injured, most suffering from lack of oxygen and low blood pressure. Shenouda's funeral will be held early this week and is expected to bring millions of Christians onto the streets of Egypt at a time when tensions with the Muslim majority are high. Egypt's Christian minority has been the target of a number of high-profile attacks in the past several years. The bombing of a major church in Alexandria in January 2011 left at least 21 people dead, and at least 25 Coptic Christians and their supporters were killed in clashes with the army in October. That incident was the bloodiest in Egypt since its revolution in February. Christians are a very small minority in Egypt, although the Coptic Orthodox Church is the largest Christian church in the Middle East, according the Coptic Orthodox Church Centre in Stevenage, England. The U.S. State Department estimates that Egypt is roughly 9% Coptic Christian, but the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life, which released a report on the global Christian population last year, says it is probably closer to 5%. Egypt did not release the number of Christians in its 2006 census, the think tank said. The leader of the Coptic Christian community since 1971, Shenouda was in poor health off and on for many years. He traveled to the United States to undergo medical tests last year. He died of renal failure ""due to the diabetes he endured for years,"" said Sheif Doss, head of the Egyptian General Coptic Association. The pope had lung cancer, which spread to the rest of his body, Doss said. ""The funeral is expected to take place in two days, as massive preparations must take place first. It is a historical event and 2 million people are expected to attend the prayers. I don't expect violence though,"" Doss said. Egypt's Supreme Council announced Sunday three days of mourning for the Coptic Christian community. Shenouda will be buried Tuesday at Emba Bishoy monastery in Wadi Natroun, northwest of Egypt's capital, said Markus Askuf, spokesman for the Coptic Church. The area is home to some of the world's earliest Christian monasteries. Shenouda, a journalist in his youth, was once sentenced to spend four years in Wadi Natroun by the late president Anwar Al-Sadat. In addition to millions of followers in Egypt, the Coptic church has adherents in Europe, Canada, the United States, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa. U.S. President Barack Obama and his wife offered their condolences Saturday after news of Shenouda's death spread, saying he will be remembered as ""a man of deep faith, a leader of a great faith, and an advocate for unity and reconciliation."" ""His commitment to Egypt's national unity is also a testament to what can be accomplished when people of all religions and creeds work together,"" the Obamas said. When a Coptic pope dies, all 150 bishops of the church's Holy Council appoint an acting patriarch until a vote is conducted for a successor, Doss said. Thousands of bishops, priests and monks are eligible to vote. The most senior bishop usually takes the role of acting patriarch. In this case, that would be Bishop Michael of Asiut. If he declines, Bishop Bakhamious of Behira is next in line, Doss said.","NEW: Stampede breaks out inside cathedral, leaving 3 dead and 52 injured .

"(CNN) -- A four-vehicle U.N. convoy was struck by a blast from an explosive device Tuesday in Syria, the United Nations said. No U.N. personnel were injured, but three vehicles were damaged, said Ahmad Fawzi, spokesman for Kofi Annan, special envoy to Syria for both the United Nations and the Arab League. The attack on the vehicles happened around the same time government forces opened fire on a nearby funeral procession, according to opposition groups. Twenty-three people were killed and 100 were injured in that attack, Avaaz, one of the groups, said. Another opposition group, the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, described dozens of people falling to the ground after government forces fired on them using heavy machine guns. Videos posted on YouTube purported to show what happened. CNN cannot confirm their authenticity. In one, the U.N. observers' vehicles appear to in the midst of chaos in Khan Cheikhoun, part of Idlib province. Shoes are strewn about on the street and people can be seen gathering near the stopped vehicles. Suddenly, there is a loud bang and plumes of smoke drift up into the sky. The camera flashes to what looks to be the front of the U.N. convoy, showing one of the vehicles with its hood now popped open. After a few seconds, the vehicles drive away. ""The Assad army is shelling the observers' vehicles in Khan Cheikhoun!"" someone yells. A second video allegedly shows the attack on the funeral procession. A voice taunts what appears to be security forces. ""Are you going to shoot us, or what? You dogs, shoot!"" the man shouts. Seconds later, the forces open fire and people scatter, fleeing the area. Idlib was the site of some of the heaviest violence Tuesday, according to the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria. At least 63 people were killed, including 33 in Idlib, eight in Homs, seven in Deir Ezzor, five in Hama, four in Banyas, four in Damascus suburbs, one in Hasakeh and one in Daraa, the group said. SANA, the state-run news agency, said terrorists were preparing a bomb in Banyas when it exploded, leaving ""scores"" of people dead or wounded. A 3-year-old child died in the collapse of the building, SANA said. Two law enforcement personnel were killed -- one in Daraa and one in Homs, the agency reported. Throughout the uprising against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, Syria has blamed the violence on ""armed terrorist groups."" The jihadist Al Nusra Front has denied a claim that it was behind dual suicide bombings that killed 55 and wounded hundreds in the Syrian capital last week. A video purportedly from Al Nusra Front released Saturday said that government buildings in Damascus were targeted ""because the regime continues to shell residential civilians."" But a statement this week from Al Nusra Front said the video ""is full of fabrications."" ""We never received any confirmation, acknowledgment or denial from our military sector in the front,"" the group said. Dissidents accuse the Syrian regime of staging attacks to smear the opposition and to try to link rebels to terrorist groups such as al Qaeda. Syrian forces carried out a siege Tuesday at Raqa University in northern Syria after a massive demonstration and fired live ammunition at a college student demonstration in Aleppo, the Local Coordination Committees said. Some rebels say they have had to sell their cows, cars or their wives' jewelry to buy guns and bullets to fight. The al-Assad family has ruled Syria for 42 years. International pressure against al-Assad's government ratcheted up this week, with European Union foreign ministers imposing new sanctions against the regime Monday. The EU ministers froze the assets of two firms and imposed a travel ban and asset freeze on three people believed to be providing funding for the regime, the European Council announced. It was the 15th time the European Union has imposed restrictions on Syria since the popular uprising began there. ""The continuing violence is appalling,"" EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said Monday, stressing that the sanctions are aimed at the regime and not the civilian population. ""As long as the repression continues, we will continue to put pressure on those responsible for it."" Just 300 yards from the Syrian border, hundreds of Syrians have found safety at a Turkish refugee camp. Though they have fled the fighting, many are haunted by memories of the 14-month-long bloodshed. Abu Mohammed recalled how two of his sons had been fatally shot by security forces while demonstrating in Syria about a year ago. Another son is missing, believed to be arrested and possibly killed without ever having met his 7-month-old son. Mohammed said he cannot justify the Syrian security forces' actions. He knows why his sons spoke up and why many are still fighting. ""We had young men that cried out and shouted, 'Freedom!' -- and they were killed for that?"" he asked rhetorically. ""We just want freedom. What's wrong with asking for freedom?"" But the Syrian government Tuesday touted ""the widest turnout of voters for Syrian parliamentary elections,"" which took place May 7. ""The citizens exercised their full rights, and they had total freedom in choosing their representatives,"" Judge Khalaf al-Azzawi, chairman of Higher Committee for Elections, said on state TV. The United Nations estimates that at least 9,000 people have died in the 14-month crisis, while opposition groups put the death toll at more than 11,000. CNN cannot independently verify reports of deaths and violence because the Syrian government has severely restricted access by international media. CNN's Saad Abedine, Ivan Watson, Anderson Cooper and Holly Yan contributed to this report.","NEW: Government forces fire on a funeral procession, opposition groups say .

"(CNN) -- Chelsea sacked manager Andre Villas-Boas Sunday, citing poor results which threaten their participation in next season's Champions League. His final match proved to be Saturday's 1-0 defeat to West Bromwich Albion which left the Blues languishing in fifth place in the English Premier League. Assistant coach and former Chelsea midfielder Roberto Di Matteo will take temporary charge until the end of the season. A statement on the west London club's official website confirmed the departure of Villas-Boas, less than a year after taking over from Carlo Ancelotti. Blog: Abramovich was right sack AVB . The 34-year-old Portuguese is the sixth manager to be sacked by Chelsea's Russian billionaire owner Roman Abramovich. Since he took control only Guus Hiddink, who was an interim appointment, left of his own volition. Blog: Can English clubs catch their European rivals? ""Andre Villas-Boas has parted company with Chelsea Football Club today,"" the statement read. ""The board would like to record our gratitude for his work and express our disappointment that the relationship has ended so early. ""Unfortunately the results and performances of the team have not been good enough and were showing no signs of improving at a key time in the season. ""The club is still competing in the latter stages of the Champions League and the FA Cup, as well as challenging for a top-four spot in the Premier League, and we aim to remain as competitive as possible on all fronts. ""With that in mind we felt our only option was to make a change at this time. ""With immediate effect Roberto Di Matteo has been appointed first team coach on an interim basis until the end of the season."" The decision to install Di Matteo ends speculation that former Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez was to be given the job on a temporary basis. Di Matteo faces a testing few weeks, with Chelsea hoping to overhaul a 3-1 first leg deficit to Napoli in their last 16 Champions League tie, an away trip to Birmingham in an FA Cup replay, while trying to improve their league position. Villas-Boas came to Chelsea with a big reputation after guiding Porto to the Europa League title and comparisons were made between him and compatriot Jose Mourinho, who enjoyed such success at the club. But results have been indifferent and his relationship with senior players such as Frank Lampard has come under the spotlight.","Chelsea sack manager Andre Villas-Boas .

"(CNN) -- Even though it's symbolic and ""there's no money involved,"" Eric LeGrand told CNN over the weekend that he's thrilled to be on the roster of an NFL team. The former Rutgers defensive tackle, who was partially paralyzed in 2010 when he injured his spinal cord during a game, was signed to the 90-man offseason roster of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers last week. ""This was a dream come true for me. I always wanted to go to the NFL -- that was my career goal in life,"" LeGrand told CNN's Don Lemon on Sunday. ""Circumstances dictated it differently, but I can at least say I'm there now. I'm on a team. I'm on a roster."" The Bucs are coached by ex-Rutgers coach Greg Schian, who helped shepherd LeGrand through the dark days following his injury. ""He's been there since day one making sure I had the best doctors, best surgeon, best hospital, best everything,"" LeGrand said. ""Everything around me was just so positive and there was no negativity around me. That's what kept me going in the beginning -- that first month -- when I really didn't know what was going on, what was happening in my life."" LeGrand, who collided with an Army kick returner while making a tackle on October 16, 2010, was initially paralyzed from the neck down. At the hospital, medical personnel told him he'd be a quadriplegic and would need a respirator for the rest of his life. But LeGrand progressed, breathing on his own after five weeks. He operates a wheelchair, and he's been able to stand upright with the help of a metal frame. With medical bills covered in part by donations to two foundations, including Rutgers' Eric LeGrand Believe Fund, LeGrand says his ultimate goal is to walk again. ""Absolutely. No doubt,"" he said confidently when asked if he'll reach that goal. ""I believe in myself and I believe in the man above,"" he said. ""I know everything in this world happens for a reason."" He told Sports Illustrated in November that he wanted to return to the spot on the field where he was injured, lie down, get up and walk away. He's already returned to the Rutgers field in his wheelchair twice: on October 29, leading his team onto the gridiron, and on November 19 for Senior Day festivities before the Scarlet Knights' win against Cincinnati. When Tampa signed LeGrand, they presented him with a helmet and personalized Bucs jersey, adding some substance to his dream. ""It is pretty cool ... something you always dream about doing and I finally made it,"" he gushed. There are plans for him to visit the team during offseason training and also attend a few games in the fall. But there's still the nagging question of what might have been. It's one he doesn't focus on. ""I wouldn't have been able to touch this many people if I was playing football,"" a bouyant LeGrand said. ""That's why I know that there was something there for me to do in my life that can hopefully change the world."" CNN's Jason Hanna contributed to this report .

"Silao, Mexico (CNN) -- Pope Benedict XVI led an open-air Mass Sunday before throngs of faithful Catholics in central Mexico. Cheering onlookers waved balloons, flags and banners as the pope arrived at Bicentennial Park in Mexico's Guanajuato state. Many said they had spent the night camped out, awaiting the pope's arrival. More than 400,000 people attended the Mass, according to Mexico's state-run Notimex news agency. The pope urged Mexican Catholics to remain true to their faith, and called on the Virgin Mary to ""continue accompanying and protecting her beloved Mexican and Latin American children, so that Christ reigns in their lives and helps them to boldly promote peace, harmony, justice and solidarity."" The pope's visit to Mexico comes as church leaders there grapple with brutal drug-related violence. More than 47,000 people have died since President Felipe Calderon began a crackdown on cartels in December 2006. The Archbishop of Leon asked the pope to deliver a message of hope to crowds gathered Sunday, noting that Mexico faces ""events of violence and death that have created a painful sensation of fear, impotence and pain."" ""We know that this dramatic reality has perverse roots that feed it, poverty, the absence of opportunity, corruption, impunity, the inefficient administration of justice,"" Archbishop of Leon Jose Guadalupe Martin Rabago said. The pope arrived in Mexico on Friday on his first trip to Spanish-speaking Latin America. He visited Portuguese-speaking Brazil in 2007 and the United States a year later. He is scheduled to arrive in Cuba Monday. Guanajuato state, which is hosting the pontiff, boasts the highest percentage of Catholics in Mexico -- well over 90 percent. Nationally, the number of Catholics is 83 percent, according to Mexico's National Institute of Statistics and Geography.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai condemned photos of U.S. soldiers posing with bodies of suspected insurgents as he called Thursday for ""an accelerated and full transition of security responsibilities to Afghan forces."" Karzai, who described the images as ""inhumane and provocative,"" said ""the only way to put an end to such painful experiences"" was to end the presence of foreign forces in Afghanistan. ""It is such a disgusting act to take photos with body parts and then share it with others,"" he added. U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has also condemned the photos, reportedly taken in 2010 and published Wednesday by the Los Angeles Times, saying they depict behavior that ""absolutely violates"" U.S. regulations and values. A military investigation is under way. The photographs are the latest strain on tense U.S.-Afghan relations following a string of incidents that have plagued the U.S. military in Afghanistan this year. A massacre of villagers in March, allegedly by a U.S. soldier, led Karzai to demand that foreign troops withdraw from Afghan villages and return to their larger bases. In a statement Thursday, the Taliban said what the photos show is typical of what the United States stands for. ""In the last 11 years since the Americans invaded Afghanistan, they have repeatedly done inhumane things which are not acceptable to anyone in the world,"" the Taliban said. The images' publication has not sparked the kind of public anger seen in Afghanistan after ISAF personnel at Bagram Air Base improperly disposed of Islamic religious materials, including Qurans, by burning them in what U.S. officials described as an unintentional error. That incident prompted deadly riots and fatal attacks on U.S. troops. NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said Wednesday the images ""don't in anyway represent the principles and values that are the basis for our mission in Afghanistan."" He added that he considers the photos ""an isolated event."" The two photos published by the paper are among 18 provided by a U.S. soldier who wanted ""to draw attention to the safety risk of a breakdown in leadership and discipline,"" the Los Angeles Times reported. One shows a member of the U.S. military in front of what appears to be the body of an insurgent. The photo shows the insurgent's head, with his eyes open and what may be his hand on the American soldier's shoulder. Another soldier appears to be looking down at the body, reaching his hand into the blanket covering it. The second photo shows a group of people, including some American soldiers, standing with what appear to be legs from a corpse. One U.S. soldier is smiling and giving a double thumbs-up, and another is also smiling at the camera. There appear to be Afghan police in that photo as well. CNN has not authenticated the images. National security and military experts warned on CNN Wednesday that the photos' release could only add to the difficulty and danger of the international mission in Afghanistan. ""It's incidents like these which are dividing American troops from the Afghans. I just don't see it getting better,"" said Robert Baer, a former CIA agent who spent most of his career in the Middle East. James ""Spider"" Marks, a retired U.S. Army general who now works as a consultant in Washington, said the controversy was ""very damaging to all the U.S. efforts, specifically the U.S. effort to assure it stays in harness with the Afghan government and the Afghan security forces"" as they move forward in their mission. And Retired Gen. Wesley Clark, a former NATO supreme allied commander, said the photos don't represent ""the standards or the training or the values of the United States armed forces"" but will add to the sense of loss and hatred built up in Afghanistan during long decades of conflict. The images' release is the latest in U.S. military setbacks this year in Afghanistan. In January, a video posted on a website showed four U.S. Marines urinating on enemy corpses. In the March attack, Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales allegedly left a remote outpost in Kandahar province's Panjwai district and went house to house, gunning down villagers. He has been charged with 17 counts of murder in the shooting rampage. The attack intensified a debate about whether to pull American troops ahead of their planned 2014 withdrawal.

"London (CNN) -- Energy giant Total has found the source of a gas leak on an offshore oil platform in the North Sea, the company told CNN on Thursday. The leak is on the deck level of the well head platform, Total said. The Elgin platform sprang a leak Sunday, forcing the evacuation of the rig. Experts are working to decide whether they can wait for the gas to stop leaking on its own, or whether the company must drill a relief well or fill it with mud in a ""kill operation,"" Total said. Nearly 240 workers were taken off the rig as the problem developed Sunday, Total has said. The leak seems to have started as workers were sealing the well in the North Sea, about 150 miles (240 kilometers) east of the Scottish city of Aberdeen. ""Ironically, it sounds as if, just like with the Deepwater Horizon, they were closing off a well and somewhere along the line something went wrong,"" oceanographer Simon Boxall said, referring to the major BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. The Elgin leak has echoes of the BP spill, but there are differences. The Elgin is in shallower water, which could make problems easier to fix, but it is leaking gas, rather than oil. Gas ignites more easily. ""This is nothing on the scale of the Gulf spill two years ago,"" Boxall said. ""This is a relatively light spill. The gas itself is dispersing quite rapidly."" ""The hope is that there is so little gas pressure in there that it will just blow itself out,"" he said of the Elgin spill. Total's share price was down about 2% in trading in France on Thursday afternoon. The French company's share price fell 7% Tuesday on news of the leak, but market analyst firm Jeffries International said Wednesday that it thought the market had overreacted. A union representing workers on the rig warned Wednesday that there was an ""urgent need"" to stop the leak. ""If the gas cloud somehow finds an ignition source, we could be looking at complete destruction,"" said Jake Molloy, an official with the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers. ""This is an unprecedented situation, and we really are in the realms of the unknown,"" he said. But oceanographer Boxall said the risk of explosion may not be as high as initially feared. ""Initially, the risk of explosion was seen as being very high. There were reports coming through of a large gas cloud enveloping the whole rig,"" he told CNN. But the fact that there has been no blast when the flare on the gas rig is still burning ""obviously contradicts the idea that there was a very high risk of explosion,"" he said. ""Perhaps the quantity of gas is not that great as first thought,"" he said. For the moment, the wind seems to be blowing the gas cloud away from the flare on the Elgin rig. The winds over the North Sea around the Eglin platform are predicted to remain strong (40-50 kph, with gusts over 60 kph) and out of the northwest through Friday. On Saturday, the winds are expected to shift slightly out of the north, as an area of high pressure drifts eastward over the British Isles, and they should weaken Sunday. Scattered light showers are possible Friday and Saturday, but the area should stay mostly dry through the weekend. Total said there was a ""sheen on the water in the vicinity of the platform,"" but said Tuesday there was no indication of environmental damage and there had been no injuries. Shell partially evacuated two of its nearby platforms, Shearwater and Hans Deul, as a ""purely precautionary"" measure, it said Wednesday. The North Sea was the scene of the world's worst offshore rig disaster, the Piper Alpha explosion, which killed 167 people in 1988. CNN's Bharati Naik and Brandon Miller contributed to this report.","The Elgin platform leak is not underwater, energy firm Total says .

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. government's drug strategy should focus more on treating addiction and less on imposing harsh prison sentences, the White House said Tuesday. ""Outdated policies like the mass incarceration of nonviolent drug offenders are relics of the past that ignore the need for a balanced public health and safety approach to our drug problem,"" Gil Kerlikowske, director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, said in a statement. The office's annual report to Congress suggests a ""new national approach"" that includes criminal justice system reforms aimed at stopping ""the revolving door of drug use, crime, incarceration, and rearrest,"" officials said in a statement. ""The policy alternatives contained in our new strategy support mainstream reforms based on the proven facts that drug addiction is a disease of the brain that can be prevented and treated and that we cannot simply arrest our way out of the drug problem,"" said Kerlikowske, who is known as the nation's ""drug czar."" Since U.S. President Barack Obama tapped him for the job in 2009, Kerlikowske has made it clear that the United States needs to do a better job of treating addicts to try to reduce the demand for narcotics. Tuesday's report builds on an approach administration officials have promoted since 2010, Kerlikowske, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius said in a joint statement posted on the White House website. ""It outlines ways to break the cycle of drug use, crime, incarceration, and arrest by diverting nonviolent drug offenders into treatment, bolstering support for re-entry programs that help offenders rejoin their communities and advancing support for innovative enforcement programs proven to improve public health while protecting public safety,"" the statement said. Overall drug use in the United States has ""dropped substantially"" over the past 30 years, the policy office said Tuesday. Cocaine consumption in the United States had decreased 40% from 2006 to 2010, and methamphetamine use had dropped 50% in that same period, the office said. But in the report, President Obama said ""serious drug-related challenges remain,"" including prescription drug abuse and the large number of people who need treatment for substance abuse but do not receive it. ""Young people's perceptions of the risks of drug use have declined over the past decade, and research suggests that this often predicts future increases in drug use,"" Obama wrote. The report's release came two days after the end of the Summit of the Americas in Cartagena, Colombia, where Western Hemisphere leaders agreed that the Organization of American States would begin a study examining alternatives for fighting drug-fueled organized crime. The war on drugs drew some of the sharpest distinctions among leaders at the two-day gathering. On Saturday, leaders debated how to address drug trafficking and violence in the hemisphere, with several calling for new approaches -- something Obama said he was open to, though he closed the door on legalization.

"(CNN) -- Lottery players across the country scrambled to check their tickets late Friday to see if they could be $640 million richer. The winning numbers in the Mega Millions lottery Friday night were 2 4 23 38 46, with a Mega Ball of 23. If there is no winner from Friday, the jackpot would increase to an estimated $975 million, said Athena Hernandez of the D.C. lottery. That drawing would occur Tuesday. The multistate jackpot has grown to become the largest ever offered that could be won by an individual. It has caused long lines at convenience stores and has many dreaming of creative ways to quit their jobs if they get the lucky numbers. ""Friday night's Mega Millions drawing will truly be a spectacular event in lottery history and provides an unprecedented opportunity for players to take a chance on a half-billion-dollar dream for just the $1 price of a ticket,"" Gary Grief, executive director of the Texas Lottery and lead director for the Mega Millions group, said before the drawing. Sales have skyrocketed at Manhattan Tobacco, a New York convenience store, cashier Alex Shanahe said. He said the store has proved to be lucky before, having sold winning tickets of $3 million and $5 million. ""The sales have tripled. Everybody wants to win the Mega Millions,"" Shanahe said. A single winner could claim yearly payments or a one-time cash option of $462 million, Mega Millions spokeswoman Kelly Cripe said. The drawing will be held at 11 p.m. ET Friday, and it can take several hours for lottery officials to determine whether there is a winner and in what state the winning ticket was purchased. The public can buy tickets until 10:45 p.m. ET Friday, but in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont, residents can purchase tickets only until 9:50 p.m. Oregon residents can buy tickets until 7 p.m. PT. The Mega Millions lottery is played in 42 states plus the District of Columbia and the Virgin Islands, lottery officials say. Mexicans from Ciudad Juarez were crossing the Rio Grande on Friday to buy tickets in El Paso, Texas. ""I would divide the money among my children and buy them a house here in El Paso, and we would come from Juarez (to) here to live in peace,"" said one man. The odds of winning the jackpot are about one in 176 million, which means a person would have a better chance of getting struck by lightning. Richard Lustig, a seven-time lottery winner who has written a book about lottery strategies, said it's good to buy tickets as part of a group, to increase ""buying power."" And while the urge to take a chance on such a big jackpot may be alluring, Lustig said to guard against getting too enthusiastic. ""Don't go crazy with this,"" he said. ""Don't get what's called lottery fever. Do not spend grocery money. Do not spend rent money."" Myra Langford, a 70-year-old retired school administrator, said she knows the odds but still bought five tickets. If she wins, Langford said, she will help fix the roof of her church and move out of the cramped Queens apartment she lived in for the past 47 years. ""You got to be in it to win it,"" she said, parroting a commercial. Psychologist Scott Bea told CNN that if a winner is a poor money manager and has been unhappy in life before winning, that's likely to continue. ""It solves one problem, but it creates a half-billion others,"" he said. ""You have about no chance at winning this, but it really gets people excited,"" Bea added. His wife asked him if the couple could spend $10 on lottery tickets. ""We could probably flush it down the toilet and have the same outcome, but if it gives you some hope, why not?"" Bea said. CNN's Mary Snow, Michael Martinez, Chris Dignam and Devon Sayers contributed to this report.","NEW: The winning numbers are 46 23 38 4 2, with a Mega Ball of 23 .

"(CNN) -- Pastor Maldonado grabbed his first Formula One victory as the Venezuelan impressively held off Ferrari's Fernando Alonso to win Sunday's Spanish Grand Prix, but his celebrations were muted by a fire in his team's pit-lane garage. In only his second Formula One season, Maldonado secured Williams' first win since 2004 despite losing the early advantage of his pole position, thanks to some timely pit stops after Alonso raced away from him at the start. Maldonado's second pit stop proved key to his victory and Alonso then had to work hard to hold off Lotus' Kimi Raikkonen, with the Finn's teammate Romain Grosjean finishing fourth, while Kamui Kobayashi of Sauber was fifth and Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel sixth. Alonso and defending champion Vettel are tied on points in the 2012 standings after a race that produced the season's fifth winner in five races, though the German driver stays ahead on count back. Maldonado had started on pole after McLaren's Lewis Hamilton was relegated to the back of the grid on Saturday because of a technical fuel breach, which resulted in the exclusion of all the Briton's qualifying times by the race stewards. Hamilton fought up from the back of the grid to eighth, with teammate Jenson Button taking ninth. ""I think it's a wonderful day, not just for me but for all the team,"" said Maldonado. ""We have been pushing so hard since last year to try to improve race by race and here we are."" Spaniard Alonso added: ""Second place at home feels fantastic and thanks to the people that came here and the people at home and hopefully a step forward in terms of championship possibilities."" However Williams' celebrations at Maldonado's win were marred after a fire broke out in the team's garage just over an hour after the race finished as the Barcelona pit lane was engulfed in thick smoke. A number of personnel from the Williams, Force India and Caterham teams were taken to the medical center, though no serious injuries have been confirmed. Of the 31 people taken to the medical center, 24 were released and the remaining seven were transferred to local hospitals for treatment. ""All the team's employees have been accounted for and four people have been taken to the circuit medical center for examination; one with a minor hand injury and three with respiratory issues,"" said Caterham. Formula One's governing body the FIA and the Spanish authorities have opened an investigation into the fire. Meanwhile, Mercedes driver Michael Schumacher's collision with Williams' Bruno Senna on lap 12 proved costly for Germany's seven-time world champion, who was handed a five-place grid penalty for the Monaco Grand Prix later this month. Race stewards decided Schumacher was at fault in the incident which forced the retirement of both drivers.","Venezuelan Pastor Maldonado takes first Formula One win in only his second season .

"(CNN) -- A whole lot of us are stuck with credit-card debt that goes up each month, mortgages worth more than our homes and student loans that extend into infinity. So it's only natural that we look at the debt crisis from the bottom up: from the perspective of the 99% who are getting screwed. But what if we instead looked at this whole mess from the top down, from the point of view of the 1%: the billionaires and venture capitalists in Mitt Romney's world? Maybe, just maybe, their problem is our problem. In fact, as I have come to see it, short of civilization-ending revolution, solving the debt crisis might actually mean saving the 1%. They have the power and the money, they own our government, and they won't go down without taking everyone and everything else with them. Instead of backing them even further into the corner of fear and defensiveness, we need to help them find a way out. And that means helping them understand how they got there. The debt crisis is not entirely President Bush's or President Obama's fault. It's not even Congress' fault. It actually resulted from a short-term ""fix"" to the economy made about 700 years ago. See, for pretty much the entire first millennium -- what we call the Middle Ages -- the 00.01%, the feudal lords, enjoyed total control over the land and its people. The 99.99% worked the land and served the lords, who created no value at all. But by around 1100, the Crusades moved a whole lot of people and stuff around Europe. Peasants were exposed to sugar, cotton and all sorts of new weaving and milling technologies for the first time. Former peasant farmers started to get smarter and more productive. They established market days and traded what they grew and made with one another. They invented local currencies to store and exchange value instead of bartering. Local currency then worked very differently from the money we use today. Someone would simply bring grain they harvested to the grain store, and come out with a foil receipt. The receipt could be broken into smaller pieces, which served as money. Since some grain was lost to spoilage, the currency's value went down over time. This meant it had to be spent instead of saved. So the money circulated very rapidly. People got wealthy, invested in upkeep on their windmills, paid one another good wages, and got taller. Little towns got so rich that they built cathedrals. That's how a peer-to-peer economy works. Watch: ""Pawning"" for rich people . But the aristocrats weren't participating in any of this wealth. Without a dependent peasant class, they had no way to survive. They didn't know how to do anything themselves. They needed a way to make money simply by having money. So they came up with some ways to force new kinds of dependence. Their first trick was to outlaw local currency. If people wanted to trade among themselves, they would have to borrow money from the central treasury, with interest. Wars were fought, blood was spilled, but they got their way. We have all but forgotten that the money we use today is a monopoly currency that costs us more than it's worth. The second great idea was the chartered monopoly: the corporation. It gave just one firm -- one friend of the king -- the authority to do business in a certain industry. The British East India Trading Company, for example, had all rights to cotton in America. A farmer wasn't permitted to sell his cotton to neighbors, or to make it into anything. He had to sell it at fixed prices to the company, which shipped it to England and let some other chartered corporation make mittens and hats, which were then shipped back to America for sale. That's why we fought the Revolution. The problem with this scheme is that it works by stifling innovation and competition. The wealthy stay wealthy by extracting value instead of creating it. The more value they extract, the more laws they write protecting the rights and privileges of the extractors. As companies like General Electric realized, it was better to sell off productive assets and become more like a bank. The system was created for people who have money to make money. The value creators are the chumps. The most surprising victims in this whole saga, however, are the corporations themselves. You think you're scared? Talk to the heads of America's corporations. They have sucked all the money out of the system, and don't know how to create any more. According to Deloitte, asset profitability for American firms has steadily fallen 75% over the last 40 years. In other words, corporations have managed to absorb all the money, but they don't know how to do anything with it. They have no skills, no competencies and no vision. It's not the 99% who need to retrain themselves in order to get jobs. It's the 1% who need to face the fact that their 600-year workaround of the value creation has reached the very endpoint of diminishing returns. They need to consider whether they might actually make more money at this stage of the game by helping people create value instead of actively preventing it. What would that look like? Right now, companies like Google, eBay, Square, Kickstarter and even PayPal and Apple are at least pointed in the right direction. They create and sell tools and services that give people and small businesses the ability to create and exchange value with one another again. They understand that real value creation comes by fostering the peer-to-peer transactions of a bottom-up marketplace rather than simply repressing such activity. But we, the 99%, are the only ones who can show them the way. We need to begin by abandoning the fruitless quest for gainful corporate employment, and instead start working for ourselves and one another. We must stop outsourcing our savings and investments to bankrupt corporations, and instead invest in the people and businesses in our own communities -- however we define those. In doing so, we will very quickly create demand for the kinds of networks, supply chains and services that only larger companies can provide. We will give the 1% an opportunity to re-educate themselves, to find a path to success, and -- for the first time in centuries -- to experience the guilt-free satisfaction of working for a living. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Douglas Rushkoff.","Douglas Rushkoff says the richest people tend to make money from finance .
He says historically, aristocracy took control from peasants of currency and its value .
Over time, they learned how to extract value and forgot how to create it, he says .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The grisly search for remains at the scene of a commercial plane crash in Pakistan continued Saturday, with officials doubting anyone on board survived. The plane, carrying 127 people, crashed Friday in Islamabad just before it was to land at a nearby airport, according to Pakistan's Civil Aviation Authority, which cited poor weather as a possible factor. At least 120 bodies have been recovered from the scene, Interior Minister A Rehman Malik said. No survivors have been found. ""In the morning we will start to search by helicopters,"" Malik said overnight, adding that officials could not bring in helicopters on Friday due to bad weather. The Bhoja Air Boeing 737-200 was en route from Karachi to Islamabad, where the weather was cloudy, officials said. Malik said family members in Karachi are being flown in to help identify the victims. Relatives and fingerprints have already helped identify the remains of 73 people taken to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences, Dr. Wasim Khawaja said. Identifying all the bodies -- many of which lie in pieces -- will be challenging, Malik said. He said he hoped DNA technology will help in the process. From what he's seen, ""I don't see any survivor here -- all 127 people seem to be dead,"" the interior minister said. The crash occurred near the Chaklala airbase, a military site used by the country's air force, which is adjacent to the Benazir Bhutto International Airport in Islamabad. Debris and body parts were scattered across the crash site as workers sifted through the wreckage in the heavily populated residential area. Four villages were affected by the crash, and debris from the plane has been recovered within a kilometer of the site, Malik told reporters. More than a 150 bags filled with body parts have been transported to hospitals across the region, according to Farkhand Iqbal, a municipal official in Islamabad. World's deadliest plane crashes . Malik said he is ready to launch a security probe through the Federal Investigation Agency in case the Civil Aviation Authority's investigation shows evidence of any security breaches. He also said Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari has ordered a ""high-powered investigation."" Head of Bhoja Air, Farooq Omar Bhoja, has been put on an exit control list, meaning he can leave the country without government clearance, he said. The flight data recorder, which is considered a key component in determining what may have caused the tragedy, was recovered, officials said Friday. The Bhoja airliner had been flying from the southern seaport city of Karachi and crashed just before touching down in the capital after its 3Â½-hour flight. Weather reports indicated that conditions in the area included thunderstorms and limited visibility. Authorities are examining what may have caused the crash and the potential for additional casualties at the site of the wreckage. Investigators are ""going to be looking at technology,"" aviation security consultant Greg Feith said. ""What kind of radio equipment, what kind of ground proximity warning system the aircraft was equipped with, weather radar, things like that ... since the weather may be a factor in this accident."" Pakistani Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani on Friday expressed ""deep shock and grief over the tragedy,"" ordering his country's Civil Aviation Authority ""to gear up all its resources for rescue operation,"" state media reported. A separate inquiry into the incident has been launched by Pakistan's Safety Investigation Board, and two crisis operation rooms have been set up at airports in both Islamabad and Karachi to provide information to the affected families. A Boeing spokeswoman said the American manufacturer ""stands ready to provide technical assistance to the Civil Aviation Authority of Pakistan."" The airliner was originally sold in 1985, Julie O'Donnell said. Comair, a South African airline, said in a statement Saturday that it operated the plane under the British Airways brand from 1996 until late 2011. ""The aircraft was retired due to it being too uneconomical for Comair to operate because of its small seat capacity and high fuel consumption,"" said Comair spokeswoman Nicola Nel. ""It was sold to Jet Aviation in Dubai who leased it on to Bhoja Air at the end of 2011. The aircraft was sold in a serviceable condition."" Responding to allegations that the aircraft was not in good condition to fly, Defense Secretary Nargis Sethi told a local television station that the government has initiated ""an immediate investigation."" ""Whether it was 10, 8 years old, or not airworthy, is something that we can't confirm yet,"" Sethi said. But Bhoja Air station manager Zahid Bangish told a Pakistani television station later Friday that the ""aircraft was new, not the old one and unairworthy."" The crash is reminiscent of one in 2010, when 152 people were killed as a Pakistani passenger plane crashed on the outskirts of Islamabad. That plane was also was coming from Karachi when it crashed into a hillside while trying to land, officials said at the time. Four years earlier, another airliner crashed in central Pakistan, leaving 45 dead. The first known commercial passenger airplane crash occurred in Pakistan in 1953 when a Canadian Pacific DH-106 Comet crashed shortly after takeoff from Karachi. That crash killed 11 people on board.

"Rome (CNN) -- Italian President Giorgio Napolitano said Wednesday that his country will adopt a series of austerity measures promised to the European Union, as officials try to allay investor fears and head off a eurozone debt crisis. Silvio Berlusconi, the embattled Italian premier who has offered his resignation, is expected to step down shortly after the measures are approved. After the Italian Parliament passes reforms meant to address the country's long-term fiscal health and its broader effect on global markets, either an interim government will be formed or elections called, the president said. Italian authorities say that if officials opt for elections, they would take place in January and likely result in a new government by February, at the earliest. The prime minister would typically remain in office until a transition takes place, though mounting market fears have raised questions about whether lawmakers might take swifter action. Investor confidence plummeted Wednesday when the yield on 10-year Italian government bonds rose above 7%, the level at which other European countries -- including Greece, Portugal and Ireland -- have sought international bailouts. The bond yields -- which represent the level of risk of lending Italy money -- surged to their highest levels since the euro was launched in 1999. The move, analysts say, could suggest that Italy may need more than a change in leadership to address investor concerns. But Italian lawmakers, for their part, could approve the new austerity measures as early as Saturday, officials say, compelling Berlusconi to resign shortly thereafter. The heart of the measures, said Finance Minister Giulio Tremonti, would increase the pension age by two years to 67 in 2026, sell state property, invest in infrastructure and liberalize portions of the Italian economy, privatizing some state-owned businesses. The moves are meant to address the country's soaring â‚¬1.9 trillion debt load, which is nearly six times that of Greece. As attention focused on Italy, the head of the International Monetary Fund painted a stark picture of the challenges facing the world's economic stability. ""The global economy has entered a dangerous and uncertain phase,"" Christine Lagarde said in remarks prepared for delivery at the International Finance Forum in Beijing. ""If we do not act, and act together, we could enter a downward spiral of uncertainty, financial instability and a collapse in global demand. Ultimately, we could face a lost decade of low growth and high unemployment,"" she said. Although she made no specific mention of Italy in the prepared remarks, Lagarde spoke as even more bad news came from Rome. Italy has been under pressure from investors and its trading partners to get its fiscal house in order. The nation has debts equal to about 120% of its overall output and an economy that has been stagnant for years. U.S. stocks, meanwhile, sold off sharply after Italy's bond yield spiked, with The Dow Jones industrial average tumbling 3%. European markets also sold off and the euro slumped nearly 2% against the U.S. dollar. On Tuesday, Berlusconi won a parliamentary vote approving a new budget that includes austerity measures sought by international lenders, but lost his majority in parliament. Berlusconi later said he would resign, and on Wednesday his spokesman, Paolo Bonaiuti, said Berlusconi would not run in the country's next parliamentary elections. In recent weeks, international concern has focused increasingly on Italy, the third-largest economy in the eurozone, as analysts have worried that the financial crisis centered in Greece could spread. At a meeting Wednesday of the European Parliament in Belgium, British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg described the pace at which the bad news has been accumulating. ""I cannot remember a time when events in Europe moved so swiftly. Many hoped that, by now, we would no longer be lurching from one headline to the next. But the focus has shifted from Athens to Rome, and it is clear that much still needs to be done to ensure stability in the eurozone,"" he said. ""Today I do not intend to provide further commentary on these specific events. For one thing, it would probably be out of date by the time I sat down,"" he added. ""Europe is suffering from a crisis of competitiveness,"" Clegg said, issuing a challenge to EU nations. ""The choice is stark: Reform or wither. Reform now or regret it forever."" For now, analysts are keeping their focus largely on Italy. Although the country is solvent, it holds a huge debt pile, and investors fear it may not be able to sustain that level of borrowing. Italy is the world's eighth-largest economy. A meltdown would send shock waves through the global economy. Analysts say the problem is a lack of investor confidence, rather than solvency, which is plaguing debt-laden eurozone neighbors like Greece. ""This is a crisis of confidence, not of fundamentals,"" said Mark McCormick, currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman. ""Italy's debt level is sustainable, but it needs to implement policies that will support economic growth."" Though the timing of Berlusconi's resignation is unclear, news of his imminent departure signaled the end of an era in Italian politics. The 75-year-old business tycoon has been a dominant force since forming his Forza Italia party in 1994. He has weathered many crises, including sex scandals and corruption trials, in his three terms in office. But the loss of his parliamentary majority -- and with it his ability to command the government -- was a blow from which Berlusconi could not recover. A senate budget commission is soon expected to vote on the measure. Berlusconi told Italian newspaper La Stampa that his decision gives him freedom. ""I will not put myself up for elections,"" he told the newspaper. ""Actually, I feel liberated. Now it is time for Alfano. He will be our premier candidate. He is extremely good, much better than one can expect, and his leadership has been accepted by all."" Berlusconi was referring to former Justice Minister Angelino Alfano, who has been known as his hand-picked successor. But others are expected to seek to replace Berlusconi. Names being floated include political figures such as Gianni Letta, Berlusconi's chief of staff, and Mario Monti, a former commissioner with the European Union. President Napolitano announced Wednesday that he had nominated Monti as ""senator for life,"" a title bestowed on those who have held distinguished roles, raising speculation about his candidacy. A Yale-trained economist and professor at Milan's Bocconi University, Monti has also worked as an international adviser to the investment firm Goldman Sachs. Dubbed ""Super Mario"" for his work in international finance, the former EU commissioner gained notoriety for his role in blocking a merger between U.S. firms Honeywell International and General Electric, thought to be a move that highlighted Europe's newfound regulatory clout. Other business figures such as Luca Cordero di Montezemolo, chairman of Ferrari, and Alessandro Profumo, former CEO of Italy's largest bank, UniCredit, are also considered candidates.

"Washington (CNN) -- Asian security may figure greatly in this year's U.S. presidential election because of urgent questions about North Korea and enduring concerns over how best to manage a rising China and preserve American influence. In addition to Asia's looming role in the global economy, specific recent developments ensure that Asia will surface as an issue during the final months of the U.S. presidential campaign. Asian security issues should be debated during the course of the election, and they will be framed in terms starkly different from those likely to be heard among Asian experts ruminating at a conference. While foreign capitals and analysts will scrutinize campaign rhetoric for clues, they would do well to remember that governing is different from campaigning. President Obama's announcement last year of a pivot to Asia underscores a long-term trend in which the United States is gradually placing greater priority on the Asia-Pacific region. Economic power is shifting from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and emerging powers such as China and India are increasingly flexing their muscles as regional military and political powers. Both Japan and South Korea, and Indonesia and its smaller neighbors in Southeast Asia, are all, to varying degrees, responding to these trends. Long-term plans are driven mostly by a rising China, uncertainty about America's long-term presence and increasing capacity for building local and coastal defenses and shaping regional institutions. Obama's rebalancing of priorities toward Asia is designed to reassure allies and new partners, without overly provoking a China vital to the global economy. For all its importance, however, the national political campaign has barely acknowledged the existence of Asian security. China has come under fire for currency manipulation and trading practices, and North Korea's Kim Jong Un managed to break into the campaign with his reckless missile launch. But the deeper, underlying issues of Asian security and their implications for the United States are awaiting more deliberate consideration. Both candidates should make it clear how America's future peace and prosperity are intertwined with the Asia-Pacific region. Here are 10 questions vital to U.S. interests that the presidential candidates should debate: . 1. How should the United States manage relations with China?  How can the United States both engage in expanded trade and cooperation and hedge against China's growing military might? What is the best way to overcome China's increasing ability to deny U.S. military forces access to the East and South China Seas and old U.S. bases vulnerable throughout the Western Pacific? How can the United States retain overall cooperation while pressing China on military, political and economic issues? Does Washington risk being perceived in Asia as upsetting a delicate regional balance of power? How should the United States approach China's next leadership, including both its possible purging of Mao's Cultural Revolution but also its suppression of freedom? Does the recent ouster of the popular leftist politician Bo Xilai signify a moderating political trend or a pervasive corruption problem within the Chinese system? 2. How can the United States maintain sufficient military power and presence in the region? Recent budget cuts mean the U.S. Navy will remain under 300 ships and that air forces will not grow at the rates projected a year ago. Given budget constraints and limited basing options in the region, how can the United States retain a favorable military balance of power in the decade ahead and beyond? Should the United States further redistribute its military presence throughout the region, and, if so, where and how? 3. How will the United States make decisions over which arms to sell to Taiwan?  China is pressing hard to put an end to America's longstanding practice of trying to maintain a balance of power across the Taiwan Strait. Improved cross-Strait relations are in the interests of all parties, and yet they also make it more difficult to prepare for any future deterioration in relations. Under what circumstances should the United States sell Taiwan new, advanced F-16 aircraft or assist it with stealthier defenses such as indigenous submarine production or cyberwarfare? 4. What is the best strategy for checking North Korean ambitions to build long-range missiles and nuclear weapons?  How can the United States maintain deterrence and avoid miscalculation? Should missile defenses be strengthened? Should the United States allow South Korea to extend the range of its missiles from 300 to 800 kilometers? Should the United States and South Korea continue the move toward returning wartime operational control to Seoul by the end of 2015? What should the United States ask of China with respect to limiting North Korean provocations? Should the United States establish higher-level direct talks with North Korea's inner circle? What additional pressures, such as targeted financial measures, might be brought to bear on North Korean decision-makers? 5. Should the United States encourage Japan to take on more responsibility for regional security?  For example, how far should the Japan Self-Defense Forces go toward shifting its focus on its southwestern islands as potential checks on growing Chinese military capabilities? Should Japan and the United States more actively pursue combined operational concepts such as Air Sea Battle, which would seek to deploy maritime and air and possibly ground forces in tandem to counter the capabilities of potential adversaries? Are bases in Japan, especially the stationing of Marines in Okinawa, sustainable? What should be the role of the United States in defending Japan in the event of a conflict with China over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands in the East China Sea? 6. Should the United States play a more active role in ensuring peace in the South China Sea? What are the potential costs and benefits of building up the coastal defenses of nations such as the Philippines and Vietnam? How can the United States reinforce its alliance with the Philippines without provoking China or the region? Should the United States insist on a binding code of naval conduct for the region? Would ratifying the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea help? How should the United States work with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, as well as larger forums such as the more inclusive regional discussions of the East Asia Summit and the ASEAN Defense Ministers Meeting-Plus? 7. How can the United States best balance support for current reforms under way in Burma/Myanmar with lingering concerns about the role of the military and ethnic conflicts?  Should the United States suspend sanctions as British Prime Minister David Cameron has recommended for the European Union? Can the United States make current reforms irreversible? How can the United States continue to maintain pressure on the government to follow through with, for example, democratic national elections in 2015? 8. How can the United States generally encourage allies and partners in the region to shoulder greater responsibility and expand security cooperation? For example, how can the United States work with others on energy and resource security for the countries of the region? What else might be done to shore up existing U.S. alliances, including with South Korea, Japan, Australia, the Philippines and Thailand? What other security partnerships, including with Singapore, India, Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam, deserve greater attention? Should the United States encourage India to play a more active role in East Asia? How far should the United States encourage allies and partners to improve multilateral security ties with one other? 9. How can the United States best protect an open global commons â€” the maritime, air, cyber and outer space arteries on which both commerce and security rest? With cyber and space threats far removed from the public eye, what should the U.S. government do, in tandem with the private sector and allies and partners, to ensure security in all these domains? 10. Finally, how can the United States best engage the Asia-Pacific region with respect to trade and finance, when the United States economy remains fragile, debt is increasing and unemployment remains high?  Is the Trans-Pacific Partnership a realistic framework for an inclusive, ""gold-standard"" regional trading regimeâ€”that is, one that would not just lower tariffs at the border but also deal with crucial issues such as protecting intellectual property rights and protecting the private sector against state-owned enterprises? What other policies would best ensure that U.S. leadership, presence and engagement in the region rest on a strong economic foundation? Obama and Romney administration policies for the Asia-Pacific would be apt to overlap more than they would differ. But when it comes to making hard choices and implementing policies, leaders matter. And here it is worth noting that President Obama's Asia team in a second term would probably lack its most able senior official: Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who has made her preference for returning to private life abundantly clear. While these issues may not reveal a wide gulf in the views of the two candidates for president, they do serve to demonstrate America's growing stake in the Pacific Century. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Patrick Cronin .","Patrick Cronin: Asian security issues have barely been discussed in campaign .
He says issues such as North Korea and China's growing power need discussion .

"(CNN) -- A Nigerian immigrant is responsible for paying child support for twins conceived through in vitro fertilization with his wife -- even though the procedure took place at least a year after the couple had separated, Massachusetts' highest appeals court has ruled. The court said Tuesday that because the husband, Chukwudera B. Okoli, had originally consented to the artificial insemination procedure, he is now responsible for the payments as the twins' legal and biological parent, according to court documents. Okoli had argued that the agreement should be void because he had consented under duress. He said his ex-wife, Blessing, threatened to obstruct his U.S. citizenship application if he did not consent, the documents said. The two were married in Boston in 1991 and tried unsuccessfully to have children. They were eventually placed on a waiting list for donor eggs to pair with sperm that Okoli had donated. Though they separated in 2000, donor eggs became available in November of the following year. Blessing Okoli then acquired the husband's consent to begin the in vitro procedure at a fertility clinic in Boston. Their twins were born May 12, 2003. Court documents did not indicate Okoli's current immigration status.","Twins were conceived through in vitro fertilization a year after the couple had separated .

"(CNN) -- Let's imagine that yesterday there was a front page story in The New York Times that read the following: . ""The recent economic crisis left the top 1% of Americans in 2010 with no more wealth than in the early 1990s, erasing almost two decades of accumulated prosperity, the Federal Reserve said Monday."" ""A hypothetical family richer than the median net worth of the top 1% of the nation's families had a net worth of $77.3 million in 2010, compared with $126.4 million in 2007, the Fed said. The crash of the stock market, in addition to the collapse of housing prices in Greenwich, Connecticut, the Upper East Side of New York City, Beverly Hills, Highland Park in Dallas and the North Shore of Chicago, directly accounted for three-quarters of the loss."" What do you think the reaction would be to that? The elite would call for the suspension of habeas corpus, the government would call out the National Guard, invade Honduras and the Supreme Court would announce that it is in session 24/7 to take any action deemed necessary to help their friends. The Wall Street Journal would have a black border on the newspaper. The Financial Times would go from pink to gray. CNBC would play funeral music for nine months. Steve Schwarzman would compare it to the H-word. Cable networks would roadblock all coverage. Minimum wage laws would be suspended, the 40-hour work week would be thrown out, perhaps they would even do away with child labor laws to get productivity up so profits could increase to make up for lost revenue. OK, we know that story did not appear in Wednesday's New York Times, and we would certainly agree that a massive loss of wealth in the top 1% would wreak economic havoc on the country. But there was, if anything, a worse story on that front page with only minor variations from our hypothetical scenario. The story said that the recent economic crisis left the average American family in 2010 with no more wealth than in the early 1990s, erasing almost two decades of accumulated prosperity, reducing their net worth by almost 40%. How are you coping? Share your economy story with CNN iReport . And the response of the national elite, the people Paul Krugman refers to as ""very smart people"" or I like to call the ""chin-scratchers,"" was a barely audible whimper. To put it bluntly, the middle class in this country has been screwed, blued and tattooed. Rising health care costs, job insecurity, declining real estate values, massive cuts to public education and public safety (no Mitt, we don't need fewer police officers, we actually need more of them and yes, the federal government has a large hand in this.) It is a depressing state of affairs when about two-thirds of our fellow citizens are caught in an economic trap that is wrecking their lives financially and emotionally. And the reaction to all of this has been limp at best. The Republicans say that if we just give the rich more tax cuts, it will make everyone's life better -- seems as though we've tried this before, doesn't it? The Democrats have done some things that have been helpful, such as payroll tax cuts and the Affordable Care Act, but there is much more work to be done. As far as other institutions around the country, the response has been pathetic. Opinion: Why the middle class has taken a big hit . There is an entire industry devoted to denying that this is even a problem. I read a piece written by Andy Kessler in The Wall Street Journal, stating that thanks to ""consumption equality,"" the wealthy work their 60- to 80-hour weeks inventing things for the masses, but there's not much they can buy with their money that the middle class can't afford. You can only afford a product, because some rich person invented it for the masses, just like they did with smartphones, hard drives and affordable air travel. Who cares if you can't afford to send your children to college or pay for your health insurance premium or what you owe on your house is more than what it's worth? Hey, you can buy them a cell phone, now that they don't cost $4,000, and talk to them as they stand in line for a job interview at McDonald's. Where are our nation's institutions that should be raising holy hell about this? Lets start with my own Catholic Church: They are spending all of their time hunting down masturbators and birth-control takers. Academics: Have you ever heard of the Princeton Center for Middle Class Studies? Not hardly. The press: There is much more coverage on George Zimmerman's wife than on the destruction of the middle class in this country. The lobbyists: Give me a break. When was the last time you heard of a lobbyist for the middle class? The point here is that we are reading the most significant economic story of our time and its effect on the psyche of the people who should know better is minimal. In the words of Warren Buffett, ""There's class warfare, all right, but it's my class, the rich class, that's making war, and we're winning."" The big scandal in America is that our middle class is shrinking, and no one seems to care. Maybe someone somewhere somehow should consider doing something else. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of James Carville.","Federal Reserve reported the net worth of middle-class Americans fell to 1992 levels .
James Carville: If the wealthy had suffered as much, there would be national panic .
He says politicians, clergy, academics, media too often ignore middle class .

"(CNN) -- Donations to the fundraising page of a young woman who died less than one mile (1.6km) from the London Marathon finishing line, are heading towards the $1 million mark. As news of Claire Squires' death spread across social media sites, so too did the link to her Just Giving fundraising page, sparking a flurry of donations reaching more than £400,000 ($650,000) and rising fast by Tuesday afternoon. The hairdresser, from North Kilworth in Leicestershire, died near St James's Park on the final stretch of the 26.2 mile (42km) course on Sunday. The 30-year-old, who had climbed Mount Kilimanjaro just last month, collapsed as she ran up Birdcage Walk -- the final stretch covered by competitors before reaching Buckingham Palace and turning on to The Mall. Paramedics were unable to revive her and she died at the scene. The cause of death is not yet known. News of the tragedy quickly spread on Twitter and Facebook, helping prompt a flood of donations to her chosen charity, the Samaritans. The donations, which initially stood at £500 ($800), surged throughout Monday and Tuesday as publicity spread through social and conventional media sources. Almost 40,000 donations have been made on Squires' fundraising page, with many people including heartfelt messages of sympathy to the tragic woman's family. She had chosen to run for the Samaritans after her mother Cilla volunteered with the charity for 24 years. She had posted on her fundraising page: ""hi guys as you all know i am running the london marathon it was just going to be for fun. but its a fab opportunity to raise money for my charity the samaritans if everyone i know could donate £5.00 ($8) that would be a great help and change lives."" Catherine Johnstone, chief executive of the Samaritans, said the charity had been overwhelmed by the response. ""We desperately wish that it was not under these circumstances but we have been overwhelmed by the response from people donating in Claire's memory,"" she said. ""These donations will be put into a tribute fund and, following discussions with the family, will go towards projects they feel would have been important to Claire."" Devastated friends described Squires as a keen charity fundraiser who last month climbed Mount Kilimanjaro for the Royal Air Force Association . ""Claire was larger than life, fun-loving, bubbly, happy, cheerful, kind, giving, thoughtful. She was just the most amazing person in the world - the best friend I have ever had,"" friend Victoria Hauser told 5 News. ""She was a giver, all the time. It's been never-ending. She's done the Great North Run, she's done a climb on Kilimanjaro, she's done a marathon previously for the Children's Society."" Around 37,500 runners took part in the marathon and Squires' death is the 10th since the race began in 1981. She is the only woman to have died in the marathon. The most recent death was that of David Rogers, a 22-year-old fitness instructor, in 2007.","Social media boosts donations to tragic London Marathon runner's website .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Smokey Robinson wants to use Twitter and Facebook to help solve some of the world's problems, such as the lack of water and food in developing countries. His ""Smoke Alarm"" system should be ""far more effective"" than organizing a telethon or charity concert because it is so much faster than physically getting artists together to raise awareness, Robinson said Thursday. ""In this digital age we have the tools to level the playing field for those in need, so I'm calling on my friends and fans to lend their voices to mine, so we can collectively give voice to those who have none,"" Robinson said. The singer and his celebrity friends are linking together to spread the word to hundreds of millions of people quickly when their help is needed. The idea is simple. When an urgent need is identified, Robinson will send out a ""Smoke Alarm"" tweet that will be retweeted to the millions of Twitter followers of the celebrities who join his ""Cause Swarm"" group. The alarm will be sounded no more than three times year for ""shovel ready"" projects, according to David Clark, who created the ""Cause Swarm"" Idea. ""The most effective way to defeat an opponent is to overwhelm or swarm them,"" Clark said. Hundreds of millions of people around the world should quickly see the call for donations and other help, Robinson said. ""This way, all you've got to do is use Twitter and get people in who are their fans,"" Robinson said. Actors James Franco, Eva Longoria and Hilary Duff, and musicians Elton John, Daryl Hall and Brandy Norwood are already signed up. While they represent a combined 7 million Twitter followers, celebs with much larger followings are expected to join soon, according to his publicist. ""I'm proud to lend my social media feed to Smokey so we can enable as many people as possible to help those in need,"" Franco said. Longoria called Robinson ""a force of nature."" ""I'm proud to stand with him as he breaks new ground in philanthropy like he's done countless times in music,"" Longoria said. ""What makes Smoke Alarm so powerful is the man and heart behind it."" The celebs who join the Smoke Alarm feed will also post the alerts on their Facebook pages. Robinson announced his plan at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity in France Thursday. The first Smoke Alarm will be sent out near the end of this year, most likely targeted at helping raise money to bring clean water to communities in need, he said.","NEW: Twitter can be ""far more effective"" than telethons, Robinson says .

"(CNN) -- A Syrian military pilot flew to Jordan and was granted asylum Thursday, a day after the United States warned members of the Syrian military they could face international criminal prosecution for attacks on civilians. The defection came as the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria reported at least 128 people, including at least 15 children, killed across the country Thursday. Some of the deaths came in ""massacres"" in two cities, the group said. The Syrian government reported 20 ""army, law enforcement and civilian martyrs"" buried Thursday. A ship carrying military helicopters to Syria is returning to Russia but will ultimately deliver the shipment to Syria, Russia announced. Part of an international row over Russia arming Syria, the ship was forced to turn back after a British company withdrew its insurance coverage due to the nature of the cargo. Russia announced that it was carrying ""Syrian attack helicopters,"" state-run news agency Ria Novosti reported. ""The ship was carrying air defense systems which can only be used to repel foreign aggression,"" Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said, according to Russia's Interfax news agency. It carried three repaired Syrian helicopters that will still be sent to Syria, the reports said. The ship has been flying a Curacao flag, but it will be switched to a Russian flag ""in order to avoid a possible detention of the ship,"" the state-run Itar-Tass news agency reported. Many world leaders have slammed Russia for arming Syria, but Russian officials insist they want an end to the conflict. The dead in Thursday's violence included 19 killed in a ""massacre"" in the town of Inkhel and 15 in a massacre in Douma in the Damascus suburbs, the Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. There were reports that many more bodies could be buried under rubble of destroyed buildings in Inkhel, the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Two other groups -- the Syrian Network for Human Rights, based in London, and the Damascus Center for Human Rights Studies in Syria -- issued a report saying the Syrian military shelled Inkhel for three hours and then raided homes, carrying out ""extrajudicial executions"" against three people ""while four others were slaughtered with knives"" and snipers killed two more people. By mid-morning, when the raids were over, the military killed three mourners headed to the cemetery, the groups said. The Syrian Revolution General Commission, another opposition group, added that at least 15 homes were damaged or destroyed in the regime's bombardment of the town. The raids were carried out by the pro-government Shabiha militias, the group said. In addition to those killed in Inkhel, 60 other civilians were wounded, the commission said. ""The humanitarian condition in the city of Inkhel is extremely miserable,"" the group said, adding that there is no hospital and the wounded have nowhere to go. ""Mass exodus is being reported; families are fleeing their houses."" The Syrian state-run news agency SANA described authorities storming a number of terrorists' hideouts in and around Douma. It said authorities clashed with the terrorists, killing a few of them and wounding others. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime often blames armed terrorist groups for the violence in the country. SANA made no mention of violence in Inkhel. Since the uprising began in March 2011, violence has killed more than 15,000 people in Syria, including 10,480 civilians, 3,715 soldiers and 830 defectors, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The United Nations has said that at least 10,000 people have been killed in the conflict. In Hama on Thursday, regime forces launched a campaign of arrests, taking 150 people to an Air Force intelligence office, where they were being subjected to severe torture, the Local Coordination Committees said. CNN cannot confirm specific reports of violence in Syria because the government has restricted access to the country by international journalists. The International Committee of the Red Cross said one of its teams tried to enter the old city of Homs, but gunfire in the area forced the team to turn back. Elsewhere Thursday, Irina Bokova, the director-general of UNESCO, the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, called on Syria to probe the recent deaths of five citizen journalists killed in shelling in Syria. ""I condemn the deaths of Ammar Mohamed Zado, Ahmed Adnan al-Ashlaq, Lawrence Fahmy al-Naimi, Bassel al-Shahade and Ahmed al-Assam, citizen journalists who lost their lives while trying to inform the Syrian people of the tragic events taking place in their country,"" she said in a written statement. The defecting military pilot who landed in his jet in Jordan had requested political asylum, the Jordanian government said. Syria identified him as Col.

The pilot is ""considered a fugitive from the service, a traitor to his country and to his military honor,"" the Syrian Defense Ministry said in a banner shown on Syrian state TV. Punishment actions ""will be taken against him according to the laws and regulations,"" the banner said. On state-run SANA, the defense ministry said discussions were under way with Jordan for the return of the aircraft. Both Syria and Jordan said the plane was a Russian-made MiG-21. Tommy Vietor, spokesman for the White House National Security Council, said, ""We welcome this pilot's decision to do the right thing. We have long called for the military and members of the Syrian regime to defect and abandon their positions rather than be complicit in the regime's atrocities. ""This is just one of countless instances where Syrians, including members of the security forces, have rejected the horrific actions of the Assad regime, and it certainly will not be the last."" Throughout the 15-month conflict in Syria, numerous members of the military have defected, some of them joining the rebel Free Syrian Army. Thousands of civilians also have fled to neighboring nations, including Jordan. U.S. Ambassador to Syria Robert Ford said Wednesday that members of the Syrian military face international criminal prosecution if they continue to support the regime's ""barbaric actions"" against the Syrian people. He said the United States and others will work with the Syrian people to find members of the military responsible for attacks and to hold them accountable. In neighboring countries, there is widespread condemnation for al-Assad, the Pew Research Center reported Thursday. A survey by its Global Attitudes Project found the vast majority of respondents in Jordan, Egypt, Tunisia, and Turkey want him to step down. In Lebanon, the population was more split, with just a slight majority wanting him to step down. The survey was taken between March and April, well before a massacre in the town of Houla that drew international fury against the regime.

"San Francisco (CNN) -- San Francisco firefighters were battling a three-alarm blaze Wednesday at a downtown waterfront pier that's slated to host events for the America's Cup yacht race. So far, no injuries have been reported. About 75 firefighters were fighting the blaze at the Pier 29 warehouse building, San Francisco Fire Department Capt. Jeanne Seyler told CNN. The cause of the blaze, about a mile from the popular tourist site of Fisherman's Wharf, was not immediately known, Seyler said.

"(CNN) -- As ""faster than real time"" technology capable of predicting our every move is discussed at LeWeb in London this week, it seems prudent to ask whether such developments will actually improve our lives. Always-connected apps and platforms currently have us texting, networking and even talking to Siri while driving. As if that wasn't bad enough, we're unveiling applications that not only know where you are now, but where you're probably going next. They'll also guess what you'll buy while you're there and who you'll most likely be talking to. Thankfully, our overmedicated and undisciplined youth are predicated to thrive in this information overloaded, attention deficit disordered world, so most don't see any problem with more data, features and apps. Facebook threatens to 'Zuck up' the human race . But at some point, someone will have to draw the line. Unfortunately, if we don't start paying attention to the social and legal implications of this technology, that duty will fall to the government. And who thinks that will work out well? As Jeremiah Owyang of digital advisory firm Altimeter Group wrote recently, store clerks could soon be using facial recognition and online influence scores to help them prioritize who needs help. But tell a politician that his or her score on Klout, the social media influence ranking website, may prioritize the attention they get from a voter -- or even the level of service they receive from a bartender -- and let's see how many injunctions get filed by the end of happy hour. Fast-forward to the anticipatory software of the future. I imagine someone is already building an app that scrapes location-based data to tell marketers where you'll eat next and who will be with you. I don't think this exists yet, but the brilliant brains behind today's start-ups will come up with it soon enough. In the digital age, everyone is becoming a spook . At what point does this real-time and ""faster than real time"" push become creepy? And when it does, who will step in to say: ""Okay, let's not get carried away?"" It will probably happen in Europe before it does in the United States, where lax privacy regulations reign. But shouldn't it be tackled sooner rather than leaving it until it triggers a heavy-handed response. If it's left to parliament in the UK, Congress in the U.S. or legislators in other countries -- democratic or not -- then we are setting ourselves up for disappointment. Whenever preferential treatment to one set of people, governments usually intervene. But surely playing favorites with race, sex, and religion is a far cry from the marketing segmentation delivered by ""faster than real time"" technology? Or is it? The real-time technology of today is already frightening for some, although it is becoming less so as the over sharing of personal data becomes culturally more acceptable. But this notion of ""faster-than-real-time,"" while fascinating, may predict a much darker, more Orwellian future. Tread softly LeWeb. We don't want you to get carried away.

"Cairo (CNN) -- The recent health crisis for former Egyptian ruler Hosni Mubarak started when he slipped in a prison bathroom, his attorney told CNN Thursday. The ousted strongman hurt his neck and developed a blood clot after the fall in Tora prison, attorney Farid El Deeb said. El Deeb said Mubarak was taken off life-support equipment and his health improved on Wednesday, a day after grim and contradictory news emerged over the 84-year-old man's health. The state-run Middle East News Agency reported that he was ""clinically dead."" The nation's military rulers denied the report, with one general saying Mubarak's health was deteriorating and he was in critical condition. Mubarak was transferred from Tora prison to Maadi Military Hospital. Now, El Deeb said, his ailing client is out of a coma and under the care of doctors at the facility's intensive care unit. ""He had slipped in the bathroom of Tora prison and hurt his neck, which caused a blood clot that started all his medical problems that night, last Tuesday, including heart attack and irregular breathing,"" El Deeb said. He said he had warned before that ""the prison hospital was not equipped with well-trained nurses or personnel to assist him or proper equipment."" The lawyer said he hadn't been informed about how the latest bout of health problems started because he was in Lebanon when Mubarak fell sick. ""I was getting information by phone with a minute-to-minute update, but I learned that he fell when I returned to Cairo,"" he said. The hospital, located minutes away from Tora prison, is under heavy security. Dozens of Mubarak supporters and opponents stood outside the hospital Wednesday and argued. Security forces stepped in to prevent clashes. Maadi is the same hospital where former president Anwar Sadat died after he was shot in 1981. Mubarak became president after the assassination. He ruled Egypt with an iron hand and as a staunch ally of the United States, which gives the nation $1.3 billion a year in military aid. More than 800 people died and 6,000 were wounded during the uprising that ended Mubarak's 29-year rule in February 2011. Mubarak and his former interior minister, Habib al-Adly, were convicted of ordering security forces to kill anti-government protesters and this month were given life terms. But other top aides -- as well as Mubarak's two sons, who had been tried on corruption charges -- were acquitted. El Deeb appealed the verdict four days after it was issued. He has until August 1 to submit a memo indicating the reasons for the appeal . Prior to his sentencing, Mubarak was already suffering from health problems; he attended court on a gurney. He had been in Tora for 17 days until he was transferred to Maadi. Some citizens thought the Mubarak health scare was staged to focus attention away from the controversies over Egypt's elections. Reports of Mubarak's failing health have taken a back seat to the political and constitutional turmoil in the country. Egypt's Presidential Election Commission has delayed, from Thursday until a date to be announced, the release of the results of Egypt's presidential election, state-run Nile TV reported Wednesday. ""The committee has not completed the verification of a total of 400 electoral violation reports submitted by the two presidential candidates,"" said Tarek Shibl, a senior member of electoral committee. ""Most probably the announcement of the election results will be delayed a day or two but nothing is final yet."" The results of last weekend's runoff between Ahmed Shafik, the last prime minister to serve under Mubarak, and Mohamed Morsi, the Muslim Brotherhood candidate, remain uncertain. Shafik and Mosri each proclaimed himself winner in the race to succeed Mubarak 16 months after a popular uprising ended his three-decade rule. Military rulers dissolved the lower house of parliament last week, extending their power and sparking accusations of a coup. The military council announced it had full legislative authority. The Muslim Brotherhood, the country's largest Islamist group, was the dominant party in the parliament. Under an interim constitutional declaration released Monday, the military council retains the power to make laws and budget decisions until a new constitution is written and a new parliament elected. The declaration says Supreme Council members ""shall decide all matters related to military affairs, including the appointment of its leaders."" The president has the power to declare war, it says, but only ""after the approval"" of the Supreme Council.","Mubarak developed a blood clot when he hurt his neck in the fall, his lawyer says .

"(CNN) -- Women's tennis No. 1 Victoria Azarenka is looking forward to more success despite the end of her perfect start to 2012. The Belorussian had won 26 successive matches going into Wednesday's Miami Masters quarterfinal -- the best start to a season since Martina Hingis went 37-0 in 1997. However, the Australian Open champion suffered a shock defeat by French seventh seed Marion Bartoli, who will face world No. 5 Agnieszka Radwanska in Thursday's semis after the Pole ended the comeback of Venus Williams. ""What I've done in the last couple of months, I have to be really proud of myself,"" the 22-year-old Azarenka told the tournament's official website after her 6-3 6-3 loss. ""I could have maybe played better today, that's for sure, but I gave it all I had. But Marion played really well today, and she deserves the win. What else can I say? I have to look forward."" Defending champion Azarenka had won eight of her previous 10 meetings with the 2007 Wimbledon runner-up, including January's Sydney International where Bartoli lost despite leading in both sets. ""I was up 5-2 in the first set and 4-1 in the second set, and I lost both,"" the 27-year-old Bartoli said. ""So I knew I had to stay really mentally tough and not show her anything. ""Even when I lost those three games in a row, I didn't get down on myself -- I had this positive energy. I was able to turn the match around again and step inside the court and play some great points."" Fifth seed Radwanska booked her place in the last four with a commanding 6-4 6-1 win over former world No. 1 Williams, who was playing in her first tournament for seven months. Seven-time grand slam winner Williams had not played on the WTA Tour since withdrawing from last year's U.S. Open, having been diagnosed with Sjogren's syndrome -- an incurable condition which causes pain in the joints and fatigue. ""I didn't have a good day,"" said the 31-year-old Williams, who has won the tournament three times andw as runner-up in 2010. ""Unfortunately, I just couldn't press the issue. I don't feel like she did anything special. I just couldn't. I couldn't get myself to do it today. ""If I'm not feeling my best, then it becomes mental and I have to fight, and you have to fight and fight and fight. Today I just I didn't conquer it mentally. I have to be there mentally more than the next player."" The winner of the Radwanska-Bartoli evening match will take on either former world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki or four-time grand slam winner Maria Sharapova, who meet in Thursday's opening semifinal. Meanwhile, two-time Miami champion Kim Clijsters is facing four weeks out after injuring her right hip during her third-round defeat to fellow Belgian Yanina Wickmayer. ""The current prognosis is that Kim will have to recover for four weeks first,"" read a statement on the four-time grand slam winner's website. "" As soon as she has returned to Belgium, she will have additional tests.""

"(CNN) -- A profanity-laced video of middle school students in upstate New York verbally abusing a bus monitor is sparking an outpouring of support as strangers worldwide rally to her side. Students taunted Karen Klein, 68, with a stream of profanity, insults, jeers and physical ridicule. Some boys demanded to know her address, saying they wanted to come to her house and steal from her. One comment from a boy aboard the bus was especially painful, she said. He told her that she does not have family because ""they all killed themselves because they didn't want to be near you."" Klein's eldest son took his own life 10 years ago, according to CNN affiliate WHAM. The bullying continued unabated for about 10 minutes in the video, as a giggling student jabbed Klein's arm with a book and made fun of her weight. Recorded by a student with a cell phone camera Monday, the brazen bullying went viral and spurred international outrage. When a bullied kid grows up . The incident occurred in Greece, New York, near Rochester. Klein is a bus monitor for the Greece Central School District, and the harassers hail from a district middle school. In an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper, Klein said children misbehaved occasionally, but Monday's incident was unlike any other she had experienced. Despite the incident, she said she does not believe her harassers are bad kids. ""Not deep down. But when they get together, things happen,"" she said. As the intimidation unfolded, she tried to disregard the harassment and didn't hear everything that was uttered, she said. But she said it hurt deeply. At one point, she said, she told two children, ""I am a person, too. I shouldn't be treated this way."" Klein said she kept looking out of the window, counting down the seconds to when the students would get off the bus. ""It was one of those things, I didn't know what to do,"" she said. No charges have been filed because Klein has decided she does not want to press criminal charges, according to Greece Police Capt. Steve Chatterton. He stressed that the investigation is continuing and the bus monitor could change her mind. ""I've gotten e-mails from the United Kingdom (and) from all over the United States saying prosecute, prosecute,"" Chatterton said. ""I feel it. I feel it. But we have to follow the law. We can't tailor the law to meet this case because of public outrage."" The police captain said the four students pinpointed in the video, all of them seventh-graders, spoke to police voluntarily and without lawyers present. Outrageous moments caught on camera . ""As one father put it, his son is sitting back, waiting for his punishment,"" Chatterton said. ""No one has denied accountability and they've taken responsibility for their actions."" CNN's ""AC360"" received statements from two of the accused middle schoolers and the father of a third student apologizing for their behavior. ""When I saw the video, I was disgusted and could not believe I did that,"" one boy named Josh said. ""I am sorry for being so mean and I will never treat anyone this way again."" A teen named Wesley said he regretted his actions and ""would be really mad"" if someone had done the same to a family member. ""If your friend says to bully somebody, please don't do it,"" said the father of Luis, another of the seventh-graders. "" We apologize to Ms. Klein. We're deeply sorry."" The video prompted an outpouring of support and a fundraiser by international crowd-funding website indiegogo.com that had gathered nearly $600,000 by Friday. Max Sidorov, who started the fundraising campaign, said the video struck a chord with him because he is a bullying victim and the first thing that popped into his mind was to raise money to get her away from the environment. ""I had no idea I was going to raise anywhere near this amount. I thought maybe a few thousand,"" Sidorov said from Toronto. ""Maybe to send her somewhere nice. But this is enough for her to retire."" Southwest planned to provide Klein and nine others with an all-expense paid trip to Disneyland in Southern California. Klein said the outpouring of support is overwhelming. ""I don't feel like I've done anything,"" she said after learning of the Southwest offer on CNN. ""It's awesome."" The school district said its bullying team and the local police are conducting an investigation. ""We have discovered other similar videos on YouTube and are working to identify all of the students involved,"" the school district said. Teen says bullies beat him, sues New York schools . It did not elaborate on whether the additional videos are related to Klein's case, though school officials say they were all apparently posted by the same user. ""While we cannot comment on specific student discipline, we can say that students found to be involved will face strong disciplinary action,"" the school district said. The students and their family members have received death threats, according to Chatterton. ""We have custody of one of their cell phones, and he had over 1,000 missed calls and 1,000 text messages threatening him. And he is a 13-year-old,"" the police captain said. ""That must stop."" Klein said she's not pushing for criminal charges, but wants the boys to be punished. She suggested a few disciplinary actions -- such as a ban from the bus and athletic activities or community service. But most of all, the grandmother of eight said she hopes this is the end of it. ""I want to make sure that they never do this again, to anybody,"" she said. What would you do with a mean kid? Gotta watch: Teacher turns table on bully .

"(CNN) -- The Justice Department has declined to reopen an investigation into the 1970 shootings at Kent State University that left four student protesters dead, after the agency found that enhanced audio recordings of the incident were inconclusive as to whether an order to fire was given. The students had been protesting the Vietnam War and the U.S. invasion of Cambodia when Ohio National Guard members opened fire. Nine others were wounded in the incident. The digitally enhanced 29-minute audio clip, originally recorded on a reel-to-reel machine on May 4, 1970, from the window of a university dorm, captured the sounds of the shootings, according to the Justice Department. The agency's decision came last week in response to a letter from former student Alan Canfora, 63, who was shot in the wrist during the incident and submitted the evidence to authorities in 2010. He says the digital version was dubbed from the original copy and contained proof of an order to fire, followed by 13 seconds of gunfire. CNN has listened to the recording and cannot confirm that account. But Canfora says an independent analysis by an audio professional on the same recording verifies a clear command to fire before the deadly gunshots. Eight Guardsmen were charged in 1974 for their alleged roles in the shooting but were acquitted because a judge ruled that the government could not prove its case. ""It's always been the central mystery,"" Canfora said. ""Was there or was there not an order to fire?"" A federal investigation found the audio quality to be poor and ""shouting to be unintelligible,"" according to a letter from Assistant U.S. Attorney General Thomas Perez of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. The letter says ""no military-like voice commands to fire or otherwise were heard,"" adding that a statute of limitations bars prosecutors from reopening the case. Canfora argued that he never wanted the case retried but is seeking a ""grand pronouncement of truth for the sake of the historical record."" ""Were looking for truth and healing,"" he added. ""When you have a lingering injustice, there's no real feeling of closure."" Canfora said victims of the shooting plan to announce May 3, the day before the 42nd anniversary, a plan to move the case to an international court.","The 1970 shootings left four student protesters dead; nine others were wounded .

"(CNN) -- You can't imagine that one of the greatest players in tennis history has ever lacked confidence, but Roger Federer is bubbling with it again after bouncing back from some heartbreaking defeats in the past few months. The former world No. 1's record-breaking fourth title at the Indian Wells Masters event in California on Sunday extended his winning run to 15 matches -- and 37 from 39 since Novak Djokovic saved match-point to win their epic U.S. Open semifinal in five sets last September. Federer won the end-of-season ATP World Tour Finals in London, but his bid for a first grand slam title since 2008 ended in the semifinals of January's Australian Open as he lost to longtime rival Rafael Nadal. He reversed that defeat in the last four on Saturday and now has a 10-18 record against the Spaniard, but denied it was a revenge victory. ""I'm just happy that my run has been so successful and so good,"" the 30-year-old, who also equaled Nadal's record of 19 Masters 1000 titles, told CNN after beating American John Isner in the final. ""I had a tough loss at the U.S. Open ... it was important that I showed a good reaction. I've on an incredible run now. I've won six of my last eight tournaments and I'm feeling really good and very happy to play. Being on this run and getting some confidence is great."" The 16-time grand slam champion has now collected three consecutive ATP Tour titles, becoming the first man to win four times at Indian Wells -- six years after his last triumph at the U.S. hard-court event. ""I'm confident. Mentally I'm really fresh, despite playing a ton already this year ... I just think overall my game is very good at the moment and I hope I can take advantage of that,"" he said following his 7-6 (9-7) 6-3 win over the big-serving Isner, who has cracked the top-10 rankings for the first time. Isner, 10th in this week's ATP listings, reached the final after eliminating world No. 1 Djokovic on Saturday. ""I thought John had a terrific tournament,"" said Federer. ""Now he's installed himself in the top 10, I think he'll stay there for quite some time because he's a player with probably the best serve in the game right now."" Federer said the 26-year-old also makes the most of the height advantage he has over most opponents. ""I think his serve is overall more sound,"" he said. ""He knows when to use which serve. He's volleying well and he's got a great forehand. ""I think he uses his size well and that's why I'm sure he's going to be around for a long time.""

"(CNN) -- From the day of his capture, Ratko Mladic has been as combative in custody as he was as a battlefield commander during the bloody civil war that ripped apart Yugoslavia two decades ago and saw the worst slaughter in Europe since Nazi rule. Mladic, 70, is accused of orchestrating a horrific campaign of ethnic cleansing that included the massacre of 8,000 Muslims in the Bosnian town of Srebrenica. The former Bosnian Serb general has been indicted on 11 counts of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity in the 1992-95 war that killed 200,000 people and displaced another 2.2 million people from their homes. On Monday, his lawyers filed a petition to delay his trial by six months, contending the prosecution failed to share evidence in a timely manner and that the presiding Dutch judge was biased because of his role in other trials of Serbs. The court, however, said the trial is set to open as scheduled on Wednesday morning. Mladic will face his accusers at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague, Netherlands. Among those in the courtroom will be the families of Srebrenica victims. ""Victims have waited nearly two decades to see Ratko Mladic in the dock,"" said Param-Preet Singh, senior counsel in the International Justice Program at Human Rights Watch. ""His trial should lay to rest the notion that those accused of atrocity crimes can run out the clock on justice."" 2001: Ratko Mladic captured . Mladic's trial begins after a landmark war crimes ruling last month, when another international tribunal found former Liberian President Charles Taylor guilty of aiding and abetting war crimes in neighboring Sierra Leone's notoriously brutal civil war. ""Both trials are evidence of the growing international trend to hold perpetrators of atrocities to account, no matter how senior their position,"" Human Rights Watch said. Mladic eluded authorities for nearly 16 years until his capture last May, when police burst into the garden of a small house in northern Serbia. Europe's highest-ranking war crimes suspect was discovered standing against a wall in a utility room normally used for storing farm equipment, according to a government minister. Though he was carrying two handguns, he surrendered without a fight. He was extradited for trial in the Netherlands. But from day one in custody, he has exhibited defiance and appears not to have relinquished his visceral antagonism toward his enemies. He drew a finger across his throat in court, a gesture aimed at some of the Srebrenica widows. At other times, he disrupted proceedings by putting on a hat in the courtroom and refusing to enter a plea. He has sought delays in his trial and said he is in failing health. But come Wednesday, Mladic's long-awaited trial is set to start. In July 1995, Mladic was in command of the Bosnian Serb Army and led his soldiers into the town of Srebrenica. In the days that followed, the soldiers systematically slaughtered nearly 8,000 Muslim men and boys. Mladic was dubbed the ""Butcher of Bosnia."" Bosnia peace negotiator Richard Holbrooke once described Mladic as ""one of those lethal combinations that history thrusts up occasionally -- a charismatic murderer."" In the three decades leading up to the violent splintering of Yugoslavia, Mladic rose rapidly through the ranks of the Yugoslav army. In 1991, he served as a front-line commander spearheading Serb forces in a yearlong war with Croatia. By the time he took to Bosnia's battlefields, he had become a hero to many Serbs, seen as a defender of their dwindling fortunes. In May 1992, Bosnia's Serbian political leaders picked him to lead the assault on their Muslim enemies who clamored for independence. Mladic wasted no time galvanizing his heavily armed forces in a siege of Sarajevo, cutting the city off from the outside world. Serb forces pounded the city every day from higher ground positions, trapping Sarajevo's ill-prepared citizens in the valley below. More than 10,000 people, mostly civilians, perished. Some observers conjured images of Sarajevo in describing Syrian attacks on the besieged city of Homs earlier this year. As the war ended in the fall of 1995, Mladic went on the run. Shortly after Mladic was sent to The Hague last year, authorities nabbed former Croatian Serb rebel leader Goran Hadzic. He was the last Yugoslav war crimes suspect at large. Bosnian Serb wartime leader Radovan Karadzic was arrested in 2008. And Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic was arrested in 2001 but died before his trial could be completed.","Bosnian Serb Ratko Mladic's lawyers sought to disqualify the presiding judge .

"(CNN) -- Oh, he wasn't always so quiet. Contrary to his somber popular image -- created in the early days of Beatlemania and never truly put to rest -- George Harrison loved to laugh, and he loved to make others laugh. After all, this is a man who mortgaged his house so Monty Python could make ""Life of Brian"" because he wanted to see it -- ""still the most anybody's ever paid for a cinema ticket,"" jokes Python's Eric Idle. ""He was a very amusing person,"" says his widow, Olivia, in a phone interview from Friar Park, the longtime Harrison residence in Oxfordshire, England. ""He was funny, and he made you funny to be around him, and if you could make him laugh, that was just great."" Of course, he could be quiet. He loved to spend hours working in his gardens. He could be prickly, too -- and thoughtful, and bitter, and expansive, and wistful. In other words, he was a human being, this Beatle and ex-Beatle and musician and racing enthusiast. (You didn't know about the auto racing?) As Martin Scorsese's award-winning documentary on Harrison, ""George Harrison: Living in the Material World,"" revealed, he wasn't easily pigeonholed -- and he liked nothing more than to take the piss out of all the cliches. After all, this was a man who gleefully participated in a mockumentary about the Rutles, a parody Beatles whose characters included a tight trouser-loving manager named Leggy Mountbatten, a movie called ""Yellow Submarine Sandwich"" and a spouse identified as ""a simple little German girl whose father had invented World War II."" Harrison played a reporter present at the pillaging of the Rutles' business headquarters. ""Material World,"" which premiered last fall on HBO (whose parent company also owns CNN) and has been making its way around the world, is being released on video on May 1. CNN spoke to Olivia Harrison and the documentary's music producer, Giles Martin, son of Beatles producer Sir George Martin. (Sir George, 86, is ""great,"" says Giles, noting that, having hung it up three years ago, ""he's enjoying early retirement."") The following is an edited and condensed version of the transcript. CNN: People often aren't aware of what a great sense of humor George had. He was thought of as ""the quiet Beatle,"" the ""mystical Beatle."" I wonder if either of you have stories about his humor. Olivia Harrison: He was mischievous. He did like to tease people a lot. I just got so used to being wound up -- he just wound me up every single day I think I knew him. And he said, ""You're just so easy to wind up."" He'd make some really bad remark, and he'd just do it so I'd start protesting. And he was funny, and he made you funny to be around him, and if you could make him laugh, that was just great. CNN: And you, Giles? Giles Martin: I was a kid [attending] Simon and Garfunkel at Wembley Stadium. I was standing in the urinals, kind of embarrassed, and he said, ""Do you need any help?"" He'd seen me with my parents, but I didn't recognize him. ... [Upon leaving, the stranger started chatting with Giles' parents.] They said, ""George, have you met my son Giles?"" and he said, ""Yes, we just had a piss next to each other."" There was no pomp and circumstance with him. And whenever it came to [recording at] Abbey Road, there was no red carpet. He wanted everyone to be treated the same. CNN: What do you think George would be doing if he hadn't played music? He loved gardening and auto racing. Harrison: I have no idea. He always said he had no idea what he would have done if he wasn't a musician. He didn't have a clue. He'd have been a total failure, he said. He had no idea how to do anything else. I think he would have found something, but I don't think he was ever meant to be anything else. When you can't do anything else, that's what you are. If you have to paint, you have to write, you have to do music, that's who you are. You don't have any choice. And he really felt he didn't have any choice. CNN: So he didn't see dropping the guitar and becoming a landscape architect. Harrison: Oh, I think he did. And he did that, too. But early on in life, if he hadn't been a musician, there wasn't an option to not be one. That's how it was. CNN: In the film, you talk about the gardens at Friar Park and how much effort and love he put into them. Harrison: And it wasn't just here, it was in general. It's funny: The root of George is ""geo,"" which means ""of the earth."" And that's -- again -- that's who he was. He just loved being out in nature. CNN: Giles, the music for the documentary came from a range of sources. What challenges did you have in producing it? Martin: Marty [Scorsese] would want the song, say, ""All Things Must Pass,"" which is a classic track from a classic album, but it's made for vinyl. And if you played it in the cinema, it wouldn't be the way you remember it sounding. It would sound small. So you're ripping everything apart and putting it together so it sounds how you think you should remember it. And that's a challenge, because you have to pay utmost respect to the original creation, and at the same time, you have to rub everyone's memories the right way. CNN: Olivia, did George usually put in a lot of winks and nudges to you when he wrote songs? Harrison: There were a lot of songs that I would look back on and go, ""Oh yeah."" He expressed his emotions in his songs. He didn't really express them so much in daily life. He saved them up, I think. Sometimes, he was difficult to talk to about certain things, and then he would write a song, and I'd say, ""How can you do that? How can you put your whole thoughts and inner being out there in a song?"" I could never do that. That was just the way he was -- how artists are. They're baring their souls to you. So nudges and winks? I guess there are a lot of them. CNN: What has been the reaction to the film since its release? Harrison: It's been extraordinary. We went to Mumbai, to the film festival there, [and] for them, to see footage of George riding around in a rickshaw in India -- not being a tourist, but participating in daily life there -- they were so happy. It was such a great response. It's been going around the world, to the Istanbul Film Festival, and it's going to Rome. It's a thoughtful documentary. It evokes something in all of us -- what are we doing? Are we doing OK in our lives? And are we making enough effort? And I think it touches that chord in people. CNN: I think the ending is one of the most moving things I've ever witnessed. Harrison: We tried to end the documentary in a different way, but Marty tried so many different endings and he said, ""No, that's it. That's what happened. That's the end of a life."" I think it's a surprising documentary -- it leads you somewhere you don't expect. You certainly don't expect it to be as deep. I didn't. I think it's a real tribute to Marty that he managed to capture that.","""George Harrison: Living in the Material World"" DVD out May 1 .

"Srinagar, India (CNN) -- The Indian army said it gunned down five militants and foiled an infiltration bid near the border line that divides Kashmir between the nation and Pakistan. Troops thwarted the bid Thursday after they saw six militants trying to enter near Uri area in north Kashmir, military officials said. ""On being asked to surrender, the infiltrators opened heavy fire on our troops,"" said Lt Col. J. S. Brar, a defense spokesman. ""The troops retaliated resulting in the killing of five terrorists."" Brar said troops recovered four bodies of the militants, rifles and ammunition at the scene. ""The body of the fifth terrorist is yet to be recovered as the area of operation is in very close proximity to the Line of Control,"" he said. ""Identity of the slain terrorists is yet to be established."" Troops are vigilant to thwart such attempts near the Line of Control, he said. The line marks the de-facto border between India and Pakistan in Kashmir.","Troops foil the infiltration bid after they see six militants trying to enter, official says .

"(CNN) -- Anders Behring Breivik, accused of killing of 77 people in a bomb and gun rampage in Norway last summer, was formally charged Wednesday with committing acts of terror and voluntary homicide, prosecutors said. Prosecutors say he was psychotic at the time of the killings and should be transferred to ""compulsory mental health care."" A fierce debate has raged over whether Breivik is mentally competent to face criminal punishment. The mass killing on July 22 was the single largest loss of life in Norway since World War II. Breivik is accused of killing eight people in a bomb attack in Oslo, then going to Utoya island outside the city and systematically gunning down 69 more people, many of them teens and young adults. Breivik has pleaded not guilty, though he has admitted carried out the attacks, the judge handling his case said previously. His trial is due to start April 16 and is expected to last 10 weeks. Read the full indictment . The court case is designed to demonstrate his guilt or innocence. His punishment, if he is found guilty, will then be based on the determination of his sanity. Last month, a court ordered him to undergo a fresh round of psychiatric evaluation as experts seek to determine his mental state ahead of a trial. Two court-appointed psychiatric experts recommended that he spend four weeks under 24-hour psychiatric monitoring so the court can get the fullest possible picture of his behavior, court documents released February 10 said. The two experts were appointed to evaluate his mental state after the court requested a second opinion because of the importance of the question of sanity to Breivik's trial. In November, prosecutors said psychiatrists had determined Breivik was paranoid and schizophrenic at the time of the attacks and during 13 interviews experts conducted with him afterward. It may not be possible for him to be sentenced to the maximum punishment for the crimes if he's deemed insane. Breivik reiterated some of his extremist views during a hearing last month, which began with him entering with a smile and offering up a raised, clenched-fist salute. He insists nobody could believe that he was insane, and describes questions about his mental condition as ridiculous, his lawyer, Geir Lippestad, told the court. Breivik claims the shooting rampage was a matter of self-defense, meant to save Norway from being taken over by multicultural forces and to prevent ethnic cleansing of Norwegians, Lippestad said. Authorities have described him as a right-wing Christian extremist. A 1,500-page manifesto attributed to Breivik posted on the Internet is critical of Muslim immigration and European liberalism, including Norway's Labour Party. The victims on Utoya Island were among 700 mostly young people attending a Labour Party camp on Utoya island. Journalist Olav Mellingsaeter in Oslo and CNN's Laura Perez Maestro contributed to this report .","Anders Behring Breivik is accused of killing 77 people last summer .

"San Diego (CNN) -- The case against Florida neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman -- which has, for the last several weeks, been exhaustively tried in the court of public opinion -- is now headed where it belongs: to a court of law. Special prosecutor Angela Corey announced Wednesday that Zimmerman would be charged with second-degree murder in the tragic death of unarmed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. The 28-year-old Zimmerman, who had been in hiding even from his own attorneys, turned himself in to authorities and is in police custody awaiting a hearing on the charges. For those Americans who think that Zimmerman acted in self-defense to save his own life, the decision to charge him is tantamount to giving in to a mob. In fact, as I skipped from one conservative talk radio show to another Wednesday afternoon, that's how I heard it described by hosts and callers alike. Yet, for those who believe that Zimmerman was the aggressor in this fateful encounter, that he racially profiled Martin and then essentially hunted him down, the decision represents something else: justice. That's how Martin's family described it in applauding Zimmerman's arrest. Personally, I'm thankful the suspect is in custody. And that has nothing to do with which team I'm on -- Team Martin or Team Zimmerman. That's irrelevant. But, if you must know, I don't have a team. I don't know that really happened on the night of February 26 on that dark street in Sanford, Florida. And neither do you. After all, we weren't there. Of course, we all have our biases. And some of mine come from being the son of a retired cop who spent 37 years on the job. From that vantage point, I would just as soon people like Zimmerman leave the police work to the professionals. And yet, even so, once the struggle began and the two men are wrestling on the ground, if Zimmerman felt his life was threatened, I can't condemn his decision to use deadly force to defend himself. I'm only sure of this much: This case had to go to trial. It had to be this way. Whether you think Zimmerman is innocent or guilty, we all should be able to agree on that much. We couldn't go on otherwise, with one segment of the country believing that someone got away with second-degree murder and the suspect looking over his shoulder for the rest of his life. This case cries out for clarity and resolution, and the only place to get either is in court. We need to be able to see and hear the evidence, and let a jury decide whether Zimmerman is guilty as charged or whether he acted in self-defense. Whatever the verdict turns out to be, let's hope that both camps are mature enough to accept it. I'm not hopeful. Too many people have already made up their minds. In fact, it's hard to see how Zimmerman can get a fair trial -- especially in Seminole County. The strain is showing. The country hasn't been this racially divided since the O.J. Simpson criminal trial in 1995. And as with that trial, how you see these events seems to have a lot to do with the color of your skin. But this time, there's a twist. During the Simpson trial, when the defendant was black and the victims were white, polls showed that most whites thought the former football star was guilty, while African-Americans urged us to wait for the evidence to come in. In the Martin case, the roles are reversed as many African-Americans seem quick to convict Zimmerman and many whites urge us to wait for the evidence to come in. That's not a good sign. Do Americans need better laws, or just better memories? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette Jr.","Ruben Navarrette Jr.: It's a step forward to have the Trayvon Martin case go to court .

"(CNN) -- Julian Cardona is a photojournalist who works in the ""murder capital of the world"" -- Juarez, Mexico. He takes pictures of bodies and survivors, migrants and countrymen, violence and vigils. The 51-year-old photographer puts his life on the line for such photography because he wants the world to know of a patch of earth that many American journalists -- even those in Mexico, too -- fear to tread and often avoid. That's because the violence by Mexican cartels and other criminals who control swaths of the borderlands have secured a reputation for ferocious violence and carnage, including to those who dare to chronicle the death toll. To capture the human suffering and endurance, often in the powerful imagery of black-and-white photographs, Cardona doesn't venture out alone anymore. He partners with other photographers -- who had been competitors under less dark times -- because they believe there's greater safety in numbers. ""When you work as a local journalist, it's more frequent that you (are) facing more risks,"" he said in an interview at California State University, Northridge, where he spoke to students about cartel violence and where his photos are on display this month. Cardona has observed how the Mexican side of the border has been a landscape of change, beginning with the North American Free Trade Agreement in the early 1990s to the massive movement of Mexicans to the United States and elsewhere. Many parts of Juarez are now a ""ghost town,"" he says. Last year, Juarez recorded 1,933 violent deaths, according to the Chihuahua state attorney's office. That figure is considered exorbitant, especially when compared with the 209 homicides in New York City last year, even though that U.S. city's population is six times greater than Juarez's. Even so, that figure represented a 38% decline in violent deaths from the year before, when the city counted 3,117 killings. The number of violent deaths was 2,643 in 2009 and 1,607 in 2008. A mere 300 killings were reported in 2007. Juarez also is known for its high ""femicide"" rate, the unsolved murders of hundreds of girls and women. ""During my childhood, Juarez was a very calm place, very secure place,"" Cardona told CNN. ""It's changed to be very insecure and has become for four years the most violent city on the earth,"" he added. ""You are covering one massacre as another massacre is happening in another district of the city,"" Cardona said. ""We have disappearances of women, we have disappearances of men, we have execution of women, execution of men, bodies of women left in the desert. People who don't pay extortion are assassinated. People who are kidnapped are assassinated, also. People who refuse to give their cars are killed, also. It is a wide spectrum of where you can be killed in Juarez. ""According to some of my colleagues,"" he continued, ""90% of the cases are never investigated. That can give you the idea of the role of the state and this terrible situation."" Before Juarez became synonymous with homicide, the city used to be a party town, with a robust nightlife. But a University of Juarez study shows that the bloodshed since the early 1990s has displaced 250,000 people, Cardona said. ""In many places it looks like a ghost town, a ghost district,"" he said. Cardona dares to enter these haunted places -- as well as populated neighborhoods. ""Most of the time the people I meet are going into turning points of their lives. It's very often I'm a witness to these changes in their lives,"" he said. ""Under these circumstances, it is incredible how people are still open to talk to a journalist and tell their stories, and how their communities have been devastated by the economy, and how they cannot sustain their lives and families' educations -- they have to migrate to the U.S. -- and also how people struggle to survive and make a living in the U.S. doing very dangerous jobs."" Cardona lives in Juarez, but his parents and siblings live across the border in El Paso, Texas, and don't visit him because of the violence, he said. CNN's Jade Biesboer contributed to this report.","Julian Cardona, 51, visits California to display his photos of Juarez, Mexico .

"(CNN) -- Two goals from Colombian striker Falcao put Atletico Madrid in the driving seat as they defeated fellow Spanish side Valencia 4-2 in the first leg of their Europa League semifinal. The 26-year-old took his goal tally for the season to 32 as Diego Simone's side took a commanding lead in their final four clash at the Vicente Calderon Stadium. Goals from Miranda and Adrian sandwiched Falcao's brace, but Ricardo Costa's injury time header, which added to Jonas' earlier strike, gave Valencia hope ahead of the second leg next week. In the other semifinal, two late goals helped Portuguese side Sporting Lisbon to a 2-1 home victory over another Spanish side, Athletic Bilbao. Chelsea stun Barcelona in Champions League semifinal . It took Atletico just 18 minutes to break the deadlock against Valencia, as they came out of the traps quicker than their opponents. Turkish international Arda Turan managed to keep the ball alive as Adil Rami looked to shepherd it out for a goal kick, but a deflection took it into Falcao's path and he nodded into the far corner. Against the run of play, Jonas pulled Valencia level in injury time at the end of the first half as he turned home Rami's header from point blank range. But Atletico eased in front after the restart when Brazilian midfielder Diego picked out Miranda from a free kick and the centre half found the net. Five minutes later it was 3-1 as Adrian pounced on a mistake from Mehmet Topal to drive into the area and finish beyond Valencia goalkeeper Diego Alves. And when Falcao grabbed his second, beating two men before powering a shot in off the underside of the crossbar, Atletico looked on the brink of a Europa League final place. But the gloss was taken off their excellent performance in stoppage time as Ricardo Costa headed into the net with practically the final touch of the game to hand Valencia a crucial second away goal. In the night's other tie, Sporting Lisbon battled back from a goal down to ensure they will take a 2-1 lead to Spain in the second leg of their final four clash with Athletic Bilbao. The visitors took the lead in Portugal when Jon Aurtenetxe turned home Markel Susaeta's cross from six yards out. But Sporting got just reward for their dominance as they grabbed two goals in the final 15 minutes. Emiliano Insua brought the teams level with a header before Diego Capel lashed a shot into the bottom corner.

"ST. POELTEN, Austria (CNN)  -- The daughter of Josef Fritzl, the Austrian man accused of keeping her in a cellar for decades and fathering her seven children, testified against him by video at his trial Tuesday. Josef Fritzl is seen without his face covered and surrounded by security guards Tuesday. One of Elisabeth Fritzl's brothers, Harald, also testified by video, a court spokesman said. The media and public have been barred from the courtroom for sensitive parts of the trial. Fritzl has pleaded guilty to incest and other charges, but denied murder and enslavement. He pleaded ""partly guilty"" -- an option in Austrian court -- to multiple charges of raping his daughter, Franz Cutka, a spokesman for the court in Landesgericht St. Poelten, said. A verdict is expected on Thursday, Cutka said. Elisabeth testified on an 11-hour videotape. Portions of the tape were played Monday, and Fritzl was asked about it. The remainder of the tape was played Tuesday, officials said.  Watch his face in the courtroom » . Authorities have said Elisabeth and her children were given new identities and are in a secret location. Details of her testimony were not made clear at the daily afternoon news conference. Asked at the news conference why other family members have not testified, officials said they did not wish to do so.  Watch media at Fritzl trial » . The murder charge relates to an infant named Michael Fritzl who died soon after birth, allegedly from lack of medical care, State Prosecutor Gerhard Sedlacek says. A neo-natal expert gave evidence Tuesday in relation to the murder charge. As he had Monday when the trial opened, Fritzl concealed his face behind a file binder as he arrived in court to shield himself from reporters, television cameras and photographers and escorted by a phalanx of police officers. Later Tuesday he dropped his guard and was pictured with the binder by his side, talking to security guards. During the trial, prosecutors have painted a chilling picture of the more than two decades Elisabeth spent in the cellar of the family home in Amstetten with three of her children. Fritzl took three other children upstairs, authorities have said, telling his wife and other relatives that the missing Elisabeth had dropped them at the house. The woman and the remaining children never saw daylight, prosecutors said, and Fritzl went away for long periods of time, causing them to go hungry when he did not bring them food.  Watch Fritzl's first day in court » . To punish them, prosecutors said, Fritzl sometimes turned the power off in the cellar for up to 10 days. In addition, they alleged, Elisabeth was often sexually assaulted in front of the children. The case first came to light in April 2008 when Elisabeth's then-19-year-old daughter, Kerstin, became seriously ill with convulsions, and Elisabeth persuaded her father to allow the girl to be taken to a hospital. Hospital staff became suspicious and alerted police, who discovered the family members in the cellar. Police said Fritzl confessed to them that he had sex with his daughter, kept her and their children in captivity, and burned the body of the infant in an oven in the house. Elisabeth told police the infant was one of twins, and died a few days after birth. When Elisabeth gained her freedom, she told police her father began sexually abusing her at age 11. Seven years later, she said, he drugged, handcuffed and locked her in the cellar. To back up his story that she had run away, Fritzl forced Elisabeth to write letters, authorities have said. Defense attorney Rudolph Mayer has said his client, 73, expects to spend the rest of his life in prison. Under Austrian law, if Fritzl is convicted on several offenses, he will be given the sentence linked to the worst crime. The charges he faces are: . • Murder: The infant who died in 1996 died from a lack of medical care, the state prosecutor said. The charge carries a sentence of life in prison. • Involvement in slave trade: From 1984 until 2008, prosecutors allege, Fritzl held his daughter, Elisabeth, captive in a dungeon, abused her sexually and treated her as if she were his personal property -- in a situation similar to slavery. If he is convicted, the sentence could range from 10 to 20 years in prison. • Rape: Between August 30, 1984, and June 30, 1989, Fritzl ""regularly sexually abused Elisabeth,"" according to the prosecutor. The sentence could be from five to 15 years in prison. • Incest: Parallel to the rape charge. It carries a sentence of up to one year. • Withdrawal of liberty: Three of the children Fritzl had with Elisabeth were illegally held captive in a dungeon with no daylight or fresh air, according to prosecutors. That charge carries a sentence of one to 10 years. • Assault: Between August 28, 1984, and April 26, 2006, Fritzl repeatedly threatened Elisabeth and their three children with gas and booby traps as warnings in case they tried to escape, authorities allege. The sentence would range from six months to five years.

"London (CNN) -- A 23-year-old English Premier League soccer player remained in intensive care Monday after suffering cardiac arrest during a game in London, his club Bolton said. Saturday's match between top-flight teams Bolton and Tottenham was called off after Fabrice Muamba, a Bolton midfielder, collapsed on the pitch before halftime. Medics came onto the field to try to revive him while fans and players looked on in shock. Muamba was taken to the Heart Attack Center at The London Chest Hospital, where he has been kept since. ""Fabrice Muamba's heart condition is stable, but he remains critically ill in intensive care,"" read Monday's joint statement from Bolton and the hospital. Bolton manager Owen Coyle said Muamba's family appreciated the large amount of messages of support they had received. ""The message is the good will, the prayers from everybody, they are so thankful and they want to put that on record -- to say 'keep up the prayers, thanks for all the support,' "" Coyle told reporters outside the hospital after visiting the player Monday. ""They have been inundated as we all have, both in the football community globally and family and friends. People are taking a genuine interest and a real concern with how Fabrice is doing."" ""It's a difficult situation but the family are bearing up as well as they can. They themselves are very positive people,"" Coyle said. ""You look at what Fabrice has been through in life already and you can tell that he is a fighter. He has such a fantastic smile and that's what we all want to see again."" Magunda also thanked fans via her account on micro-blogging website Twitter. ""2 everyone out there thank u so much for all the love and support collectively as a family we appreciate it all. Plz continue 2 pray 4 fab x,"" she wrote on Monday. ""Fabrice WILL!! Pull through because God is good. Love u so much @fmuamba keep strong we're praying for u honey xx"" Bolton said Sunday that Muamba received ""prolonged resuscitation"" on the ground and en route to the hospital, where his heart eventually started working. ""As is normal medical practice, Fabrice remains anesthetized in intensive care and will be for at least 24 hours,"" the club said. ""His condition continues to be closely monitored by the cardiac specialists at the hospital."" Players pray for Muamba's recovery . Muamba, who is from the Democratic Republic of Congo and has represented England at under-21 level, fell to the ground in the 41st minute with no other players near him. Referee Howard Webb consulted both teams before calling off the match at Tottenham's home ground in London, which was a quarterfinal tie in England's prestigious knockout competition, the FA Cup. A member of CNN World Sport's London staff was at the match at White Hart Lane and described the situation. ""We were situated on the halfway line. ... Fabrice Muamba just hit the deck out of nowhere,"" assistant producer Zayn Nabbi said by phone. ""We realized quite quickly that this was serious because the medical staff all rushed on and they were waved onto the field by the Tottenham players. From what we saw they were trying to resuscitate Fabrice Muamba."" Bolton Wanderers announced Sunday that its match with Aston Villa, scheduled for Tuesday evening, was postponed after talks with the club and the Premier League. Bolton thanked them both for their support and understanding. Muamba's peers have been quick to show their support on micro-blogging website Twitter. ""For all those asking, I know as much as you do,"" wrote clubmate Stuart Holden, a U.S. international. ""Waiting anxiously for updates from teammates. Fab is a fighter! prayforMuamba."" Tottenham's Rafael van der Vaart wrote: ""Terrible what happened with Muamba during the game. We're all praying for him."" The last player to die after collapsing in a match in Britain was Motherwell's Phil O'Donnell, who suffered heart failure during a 2007 game against Scottish rivals Dundee United and passed away on the way to hospital. The most high-profile such tragedy was when Cameroon international Marc-Vivien Foe collapsed during a Confederations Cup semifinal against Colombia in 2003 and died in hospital. There have been two similar incidents more recently in Spain, involving Sevilla's Antonio Puerta in 2007 and Espanyol's Daniel Jarque in 2009. Muamba grew up in Kinshasa, the capital of what was then known as Zaire. After moving to the UK in 1999 he began his football career with Premier League club Arsenal in 2005 but did not make a first-team appearance in the top division and was loaned out to Birmingham. He signed a permanent deal with the Midlands club in 2007 before moving to Bolton a year later for a fee of Â£5 million ($8 million). English Football Association chairman David Bernstein paid tribute to Muamba, who played for his country at most age-group levels. ""Fabrice has played 33 times for England Under-21s, captaining Stuart Pearce's side during this time, and is a player -- and more importantly -- a person we care greatly for,"" Bernstein said. Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore praised those at the game for the way they reacted to the situation. ""We would like to praise the players, match officials, coaching staff and medical teams of both clubs at White Hart Lane for their swift actions in attending Fabrice,"" Scudamore said in a statement. ""The League would also like to commend the compassion shown by the fans of Bolton Wanderers and Tottenham Hotspur."" Those sentiments were echoed by Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy, who in a club statement, thanked both sets of fans for their support and behavior. Levy said: ""Too often we read the negatives about football and yet last night, at a time of intense emergency and uncertainty, we saw the true humanity and empathy of the footballing family.""","Fabrice Muamba still in critical condition in intensive care at London heart hospital .

"(CNN) -- Photos of U.S. soldiers posing with bodies of suspected Afghan insurgents, published Wednesday by the Los Angeles Times, depict behavior that ""absolutely violates"" U.S. regulations and values, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said Wednesday. ""This is not who we are, and it's certainly not who we represent when it comes to the great majority of men and women in uniform who are serving there,"" he said. The two photos published by the paper are among 18 provided by a U.S. soldier who wanted ""to draw attention to the safety risk of a breakdown in leadership and discipline,"" The Times reported. The military said an investigation is under way. NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said the images ""don't in anyway represent the principles and values that are the basis for our mission in Afghanistan."" He added that he considers the photos ""an isolated event."" The photos, from incidents in 2010, represent ""a serious error in judgment by several soldiers who have acted out of ignorance and unfamiliarity with U.S. Army values,"" NATO'S International Security Assistance Force said in a statement. Gen. John Allen, the ISAF commander, also condemned the photos. One shows a member of the U.S. military in front of what appears to be the body of an insurgent. The photo shows the insurgent's head, with his eyes open and what may be his hand on the American soldier's shoulder. Another soldier appears to be looking down at the body, reaching his hand into the blanket covering it. ""A soldier from the Army's 82nd Airborne Division with the body of an Afghan insurgent killed while trying to plant a roadside bomb,"" the caption reads. ""The photo is one of 18 provided to The Times of U.S. soldiers posing with corpses."" The second photo shows a group of people, including some American soldiers, standing with what appear to be legs from a corpse. One U.S. soldier is smiling and giving a double thumbs-up, and another is also smiling at the camera. There appear to be Afghan police in that photo as well. The paper says the photo was from 2010, when the division arrived at a police station in Zabul province and inspected body parts. ""Then the mission turned macabre: The paratroopers posed for photos next to Afghan police, grinning while some held -- and others squatted beside -- the corpse's severed legs."" CNN has not authenticated the images. Nancy Sullivan, spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Times, said, ""We verified the authenticity of the photos through interviews with the soldier who provided the photos, with Pentagon officials and with commanders from the unit."" ""An investigation that could lead to disciplinary measures is under way,"" Pentagon spokesman George Little said. ""Anyone found responsible for this inhuman conduct will be held accountable in accordance with our military justice system."" The Geneva Conventions say the remains of the dead in a conflict ""shall be respected."" Panetta said he had called on The Times not to publish the photos because the enemy uses these kinds of images to incite violence. Lives have been lost because of publication of similar images in the past, he said. ""This is war, and I know that war is ugly, and it's violent,"" Panetta said at a NATO meeting in Brussels, Belgium. ""And I know that young people, sometimes caught up in the moment, make some very foolish decisions. I'm not excusing them, not excusing that behavior. But neither do I want these images to bring further injury to our people or to our relationship with the Afghan people."" Earlier, Little said U.S. forces were taking security measures to guard against potential violence. In the article, Times Editor Davan Maharaj said, ""After careful consideration, we decided that publishing a small but representative selection of the photos would fulfill our obligation to readers to report vigorously and impartially on all aspects of the American mission in Afghanistan, including the allegation that the images reflect a breakdown in unit discipline that was endangering U.S. troops."" The soldier who provided the photos served in Afghanistan with the 82nd Airborne's 4th Brigade Combat Team from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, The Times reported. ""He said the photos point to a breakdown in leadership and discipline that he believed compromised the safety of the troops."" ""He expressed the hope that publication would help ensure that alleged security shortcomings at two U.S. bases in Afghanistan in 2010 were not repeated,"" the paper said. The soldier and two other former members of the battalion ""said in separate interviews that they and others had complained of inadequate security at the two bases."" The commander of the 4th Brigade at the time the photos were taken and the then-commander of the 1st Battalion said they were not authorized to comment, the paper reported. The Pentagon declined a request that Army officials contact active-duty soldiers in the photos to offer them a chance to comment as well. ""The Times sent requests for comment by e-mail and Facebook to seven soldiers in the photos. One, now serving in Afghanistan, declined to comment. The others did not respond."" Lt. Col. Jimmie Cummings, an ISAF spokesman, said The Times told military officials about the photos in March, triggering an investigation. Cummings did not say where the photos were taken or how many people are under investigation. ""Such actions are morally repugnant, dishonor the sacrifices of hundreds of thousands of U.S. soldiers and civilians who have served with distinction in Afghanistan, and do not represent the core values of the United States or our military,"" the U.S. Embassy in Kabul said. U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, who served in Vietnam and was a prisoner of war, said the photos do not represent the behavior of the majority of American troops. ""What bothers me the most is 99.9% of these young Americans that are serving over there have the highest standards,"" he said Wednesday, when asked about the photos. ""I've seen with my own eyes the thousands of acts of kindness and generosity that our men and women of the military show to the Afghan people. I've seen the partnerships, relationships, friendships, and all of that, of course, is tarnished so badly by a story such as what you're talking about."" In describing one photo not shown in the newspaper, The Times said two soldiers held a dead man's hand with the middle finger raised. ""A soldier leaned over the bearded corpse while clutching the man's hand. Someone placed an unofficial platoon patch reading 'Zombie Hunter' next to other remains and took a picture."" The Times article notes that virtually all the men in the photos ""had friends who were killed or wounded by homemade bombs or suicide attacks, according to the soldier who provided the images."" Rasmussen said ""such very unfortunate incidents do not in any way define our relationship with the Afghan people and our relationship with the Afghan security forces."" The Taliban condemned the photos, saying what they show is typical of what the United States stands for. ""In the last 11 years since the Americans invaded Afghanistan, they have repeatedly done inhumane things which are not acceptable to anyone in the world,"" the Taliban said in statement released Thursday. It is the latest in a string of incidents that have plagued the U.S. military in Afghanistan this year. In January, a video posted on a website showed four U.S. Marines urinating on enemy corpses. A month later, ISAF personnel at Bagram Air Base improperly disposed of Islamic religious materials, including Qurans, by burning them in what U.S. officials described as an unintentional error. And Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales allegedly left a remote outpost in Kandahar province's Panjwai district in March and went house-to-house, gunning down villagers. He has been charged with 17 murders in the shooting rampage. Perhaps the most notorious incident involving photos of U.S. troops over the past decade took place in Iraq in 2004. Images of U.S. military personnel abusing naked and restrained prisoners in the Abu Ghraib detention facility outside Baghdad shocked the world.","Sen.

"(CNN) -- A single braid down the back, a light hunting jacket, a pair of sturdy leather shoes and a small golden pin; not exactly a culmination of things you would call fashionable. But these are the key accessories to one of the hottest new characters to hit the big screen: Katniss Everdeen. Katniss, the arrow-slinging, tribute-hunting teenager from the upcoming movie ""The Hunger Games,"" based on Suzanne Collins' bestselling book, has made a huge style splash on the Web. Dozens of ""how-to-dress like Katniss"" web pages, blog posts and articles are being bookmarked and pinned up by girls of all ages. But when did hunting gear and cotton dresses become so fashionable? For the same reason the little black dress from Audrey Hepburn's ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" is still a staple today: It's not just the look that audiences are responding to, but what that character represents, explains Teen Vogue's News Fashion Editor, Jane Keltner de Valle. In the case of Katniss, ""Hunger Games"" costume designer Judianna Makovsky kept in mind that the character's style had to tell the story of a distinctively strong young woman who doesn't yet know her own strength. After all, Makovsky says, Katniss is a character who's ""just trying to survive."" So when she created those costumes, she looked to the past for inspiration, creating items for Katniss' home of District Twelve by incorporating themes from the Great Depression. As a result, ""Katniss has practical clothes -- it has to make sense where she got them,"" Makovsky says. ""District 12 is American work wear, and that is what she would wear while she hunted."" Katniss isn't the only recent movie character to rev up the fashion scene. ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo's"" Lisbeth Salander enthralled viewers with her distinctive punk style, and even ""Twilight's"" Bella Swan gained fashion popularity with her simple wedding dress seen in ""Breaking Dawn"" and Northern Pacific coast fashion. ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo's"" dark urban look was recreated for consumers by Swedish retailer H&M, which released a limited edition Lisbeth Salander-inspired line, featuring key leather pieces, torn and worn shirts and hoodies, all tied together with an industrial color scheme. One Los Angeles store sold out of the line in 10 minutes after the line went on sale, according to ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo's"" costume designer, Trish Summerville, who worked in conjunction with H&M to create the line. Teen Vogue's Keltner de Valle also notes how that theme resonated on the runway during the fall fashion season in 2011. ""For so long, designers were collaborating with mass retailers, [but] a new trend could be costume designers collaborating with mass retailers to create [a] character-inspired wardrobe. It almost seems like a no-brainer."" And yet, while Summerville created a character-inspired line with Lisbeth Salander, Makovsky said that's currently not her intention. ""I didn't want the fashion to take over, [because] that is not what the movie is about,"" she said. ""The movie is about a girl's journey. That is what a costume designer does, we tell the character's story."" Whether the clothing ends up being crafted specifically for fans or not, it's always that story told through a character's costume that the consumers cling to. To dress like Katniss, in some regard, is to adopt her trademark characteristics, and the popularity of her clothing points to a characterization that's hit home. ""There was a time when being powerful and being pretty were mutually exclusive, and these strong female archetypes are becoming really popular and girls are really responding to that,"" says Keltner de Valle. InStyle.com entertainment editor Bronwyn Barnes agrees, positing out that the look and feel of characters like Katniss and Lisbeth are so appealing to audiences because these characters are in charge of their own destinies. ""I think these characters struck the right time in pop culture,"" Barnes said. ""People are looking for the modern day heroine."" And to dress like one, too.","Katniss Everdeen of ""Hunger Games"" has made a huge style splash on the web .

"(CNN) -- Fang Lizhi, a famed Chinese democracy activist, has died in the United States, where he fled in exile more than 20 years ago, fellow activists said. He was 76. Fang died Friday in Tucson, Arizona, according to Wang Dan, a prominent student leader of the 1989 Tiananmen Square student protests. ""My most, most respected teacher Fang Lizhi has died,"" Wang wrote on Facebook. ""I am immensely sad. I hope that the Chinese people will forever remember him, that in our history there was a thinker named Fang (Lizhi) who inspired a 1989 generation and awakened the people to aspire to human rights and democracy."" He added, ""Sooner or later, there will be a day when China will be proud of Fang Lizhi."" Fang, an accomplished astrophysicist, served as vice president of the elite University of Science and Technology at Hefei, Anhui province. He was dismissed from his job and expelled from the Communist Party in 1987, blamed for sympathizing with student protesters. He was one of the three noted intellectuals who were publicly criticized during the ""anti-bourgeois liberalization"" campaign at that time, though Fang continued to speak out for democracy. In early 1989, he wrote an open letter to Communist Party leader Deng Xiaoping, calling for the release of Chinese political prisoners. After the bloody crackdown during the Tiananmen protests on June 4, 1989, Fang and his wife Li Shuxian sought refuge inside the U.S. embassy in Beijing. A year later, they were allowed to leave China for Britain and were soon after granted political refuge in the United States. Fang spent the past years doing research at the University of Arizona in Tucson.","Fang Lizhi, 76, a famed Chinese democracy activist, has died in the United States .

"(CNN) -- Guinea-Bissau has been suspended from the African Union in the wake of last week's military coup. The suspension remains ""until the restoration of constitutional order,"" the union said Tuesday. The union cited the ""recurrence of illegal and unacceptable interference of the leadership of Guinea-Bissau's army on the politics of the country, creating instability and culture of impunity, which have hampered the development of the country."" The union said it will request the cooperation of international organizations including the United Nations, the European Union and the Economic Community of West African States to apply additional sanctions, including a travel ban on key members of the junta. ""The African Union is doing their job, and we are doing our job,"" said Daba Naualna, a spokesman for the junta that has taken over the country. He argued that history will show that the coup was the right thing to do. Eventually, the African Union will be able to understand the situation, he said. The military command has said the revolt was in response to a ""secret deal"" between the government and Angola to allow Angolan troops in the country to attack the military. The junta insisted that the African Union, whose rotating presidency is currently held by Angola, supports intervention by Angolan forces. Angola, also a former Portuguese colony, issued a statement last week saying it would unilaterally withdraw its troops. A number of its troops are in Guinea-Bissau to help reform the country's armed forces, Angola said. Meanwhile, Naualna said an interim president and a former prime minister of Guinea-Bissau will be freed from detention as soon as conditions allow. Interim President Raimundo Pereira and former Prime Minister Carlos Gomes Jr. ""are being detained for security reasons,"" Naualna said. The junta ""does not anticipate"" the return of Pereira and Gomes to power, despite international condemnations of the coup. The developments came after the military command met Monday with the Economic Community of West African States regional bloc, which has denounced the coup and called for the junta ""to restore constitutional rule immediately."" Naualna said the West African group agreed to send a technical mission to Guinea-Bissau as soon as possible to help find solutions to the crisis, though specific details were not released. Ivory Coast President Alassane Ouattara will lead the talks within the bloc, Naualna said. After Thursday's coup, military leaders and a group of mostly opposition political parties declared the formation of a transitional national council, spokesman Fernando Vaz said. The composition of the council had yet to be determined, he said, but the president of the council will be the interim president of the country until parliamentary and presidential elections are held. The formation of the council effectively means the constitution will be suspended, a scenario similar to events in 2003, after a coup against President Kumba Iala. Coups and coup attempts are common in Guinea-Bissau since it won independence from Portugal in 1974. Soldiers took Pereira and Gomes into custody Thursday night, sparking international condemnation. Leaders of the nation's armed forces have taken control of the nation to ensure stability, Naualna said. ""The (army chief of staff) thinks, for the sake of the country, that power cannot fall into the streets and decided to have (the military) play its part in seeking solutions with the political class to resolve this crisis,"" he said. On Sunday, the ""military command"" announced the closure of Guinea-Bissau to all air traffic and maritime circulation from abroad as a matter ""of national security and safeguard of the territory of Guinea-Bissau."" A chorus of world leaders has denounced last week's coup, which occurred just before the second round of a presidential election set for April 29. The African Union, the United Nations and the United States called for a return to civilian rule and demanded the release of the leaders. Foreign ministers from the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries, of which Guinea-Bissau is a member, have also condemned the coup. Guinea-Bissau's conflicts have ravaged its infrastructure and economy, leaving it among the poorest in the world. The nation's first round of voting in a presidential election was held in March, and campaigning for the second round was about to begin. The election was prompted by the death of the incumbent Malam Bacai Sanha in January after a long illness. Sanha had become president in September 2009 after the assassination of his predecessor. Despite his coming to power in what international observers deemed a fair and peaceful election, his tenure was marked by turmoil among the country's military and political leadership. To date, no democratically elected president of the country has served a full five-year term.

"London (CNN) -- Britain's Prince Harry is to travel to the United States to be presented with a prestigious award honoring his work with war veterans and serving members of the armed forces. The Prince will visit Washington D.C. on May 7 to receive the Atlantic Council's award for ""distinguished humanitarian leadership,"" St James's Palace announced Monday. A spokeswoman for the palace told CNN the trip -- Harry's first to the U.S. since he took part in Apache helicopter training in the deserts of Arizona and California last year -- was likely to be a flying visit, lasting less than 24 hours. As well as attending the prizegiving dinner at the Atlantic Council, Prince Harry is also expected to meet British and American athletes who have taken part in the Warrior Games, a paralympic sports tournament for armed services personnel, in Colorado. And while it is not yet clear if he will attend other events while in the country, there is expected to be a huge level of interest in the Prince's travel plans. When his brother Prince William visited the States last year with the Duchess of Cambridge, the newlywed couple was met with huge and enthusiastic crowds. Prince Harry is said to be ""honored"" by news of the award, which he plans to accept on behalf of his brother and their foundation. St James's Palace says he will use the event to pay tribute to the work of British and American charities which help to rehabilitate wounded servicemen and women, and to reintegrate veterans into civilian life. The Atlantic Council is a non-partisan U.S.-based think-tank which promotes transatlantic cooperation and international security. Other high-profile guests whose work will be recognized by the council on May 7 are U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon, violin virtuoso Anne-Sophie Mutter, and Unilever CEO Paul Polman.

"Washington (CNN) -- The shocking murder last weekend of 16 Afghan civilians -- 9 of them children -- by a U.S. soldier is raising many questions about the war. Coming right after the accidental burning of several Qurans at a U.S. base last month, which sparked mass protests across the country, it seems reasonable to ask: what is coming next? The sad answer is that there probably won't be a huge public reaction to the killings. The burning of the Qurans -- which the U.S. claims was accidental -- was a fresh outrage to many Afghans. While the Taliban often claims the U.S. disrespects Islam and wants to destroy it, few Afghans had any real reason to believe that in their daily lives. The Quran burning shocked the Afghan public enough for some political opportunists to whip up protests in response. In contrast, Sunday's mass murder is not a new outrage for Afghanistan. While the deliberate killing of civilians is (thankfully) rare, many Afghans do not distinguish between accidental and deliberate civilian death. Last May, U.S. helicopters in Kunar province came under rocket fire from insurgents; in responding they accidentally fired back at what turned out to be children gathering firewood, killing 9. General Petraeus was quick to apologize for the incident, but nevertheless the reaction in Kabul was angry and resentful: many simply could not believe that children could be accidentally mistaken for insurgents. Sunday's mass killing is still shocking and upsetting -- but it is no longer surprising. Sunday's mass murder, in other words, is not a game-changing event. The game has already changed, and many Afghans are not surprised when the U.S. kills a bunch of civilians. Al-jazeera interviewed some of the survivors and uncovered a darker angle as well: one reason the victims did not resist is that they were used to the so-called ""night raids"" -- nighttime special operations raids on housing compounds. They were so used to Americans kicking in the doors to their homes and even shooting their guns that at first the rampage didn't seem strange. So where does the war go from here? A huge challenge facing President Obama is that the U.S. is fighting one war while the insurgency is fighting a very different one. The U.S. war is obsessed with the traditional metrics of warfare: holding territory, killing or capturing bad guys, exacting details of building roads, schools, and hospitals. The insurgency, on the other hand, is obsessed with influence, undermining confidence in the government, and creating the perception that the U.S. is at war with Islam. Put simply, the U.S. never put in place the strategic and political framework to make much headway in Afghanistan. Despite the renewed push for negotiations with the Taliban, there is no political strategy for the country. There is no end state for the war, either -- right now, the plan is to drawdown to about 20,000 troops or so -- similar to troop levels in 2008 -- and stay that way for the indefinite future. That's not a strategy, and it's not a plan. Because there is no political strategy for the war -- nothing that takes Afghan and Taliban politics into consideration -- the U.S. has no concept of how to manage or react to the political consequences of incidents like Sunday's rampage. That's why the military was clueless in responding to last month's Quran burnings, or to January's Marine urination scandal, or to the ""kill team"" in Kandahar last year. At this point, there is little the U.S. can do to salvage the situation in Afghanistan. Sunday's mass killing is tragic but it is not a game-changing event. Focusing on a long-term commitment to working through Afghanistan politics is a good start -- de-emphasizing the military's role in the conflict and shifting to a politically and socially engaged role would actually address some of these shortcomings. But shifting Afghanistan from a military engagement to a political one would, by design, extend U.S. operations there. An ABC News-Washington Post poll released Monday shows 60% of Americans no longer think the war is worth the costs. From the public's perspective, the house of cards is falling and the U.S. would do best to just pull out and cut their losses. Ultimately, Afghans will suffer the consequences -- of Sunday's raid, of the war, of America's withdrawal from the region. Abandoning Afghanistan will impose huge costs in Afghanistan but the last ten years of directionless fighting has left Americans tired and frustrated with a war that seems to go nowhere but down. There needs to be a long-term strategy for the country but, especially now, it probably won't happen. Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion .

"Washington (CNN) -- Three U.S. Secret Service members will leave the agency because of an alleged prostitution scandal in Colombia, the agency said Wednesday. One of them is a supervisory employee who is being allowed to retire, and another employee has resigned, the agency said. A third agent, another supervisory employee, is being pushed out, with the agency proposing he be removed. A U.S. official said the agent plans to fight his ouster. Another eight members allegedly involved in the scandal are on administrative leave with their security clearances suspended. Scandal raises questions about macho agency culture . The employees are accused of bringing prostitutes to a hotel in Colombia ahead of last week's visit by U.S. President Barack Obama, who was there to attend a pan-American summit. The alleged prostitutes, the youngest of whom are in their early 20s, had all signed in at Cartagena's Hotel El Caribe, where the Secret Service members apparently stayed, flashing their local ID cards. But one of the women, the source said, was involved in a dispute about how much she was allegedly to be paid for the night. That dispute brought the incident to light and sparked controversy in both countries. A review board is expected to be created to determine whether the alleged scandal is an isolated incident or emblematic of a broader agency culture, a source said. ""The only way they will prevent this from happening again in the future is to find out if this is one particular case or if it's a pattern,"" said U.S. Rep. Peter King, R-New York, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. ""We're working and doing our own investigation and whatever we need from the Secret Service we've been getting,"" King said. ""We want a minute-by-minute, hour-by-hour account of what happened, how it happened, what went on, who knew what was happening. And I have no doubt the Secret Service will give us that."" As many as 10 U.S. military personnel from all branches of the armed forces are being questioned about potential misconduct, including five members of America's elite Army Special Forces. Obama has said he expects a ""rigorous"" investigation. Investigators are also looking into whether drugs were involved, according to a separate source with knowledge of the investigation. Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan has told subordinates to use ""all tools available"" to conduct the investigation and has made it known that he believes drug testing is within his rights, the source said. It is not clear whether any of those accused have been tested, and authorities say drug use is not consistent with their findings so far, though they are continuing to investigate the allegations alongside local police. A U.S. official said the Secret Service interviewed all of the maids at the agents' hotel and the maids said they found no drugs in the rooms. The scandal is sure to come up when Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano testifies next week at a previously scheduled Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on oversight of the Department of Homeland Security. The hearing is scheduled for 10 a.m. ET Wednesday. At least one congressman, U.S. Rep. Randy Forbes, R-Virginia, has called for Sullivan to be replaced. ""There's only so many strikes you get, in baseball it's three,"" said Forbes, a senior member of the House Armed Serves Committee, referencing a 2009 security breach in which a Virginia couple crashed Obama's first White House state dinner, as well as apparent agency overspending in that same year. ""I think he's had three,"" Forbes added. ""I think it's time to put somebody else in there to make sure we're getting a different culture in the Secret Service."" Forbes seeks director's ouster . Sullivan has directed the Secret Service since May 2006. He has been with the agency since 1983. A Colombian official said Wednesday the incident has has overshadowed his country's showcase of the ""beautiful, calm city"" of Cartagena during the summit. Nausicrate Perez, a municipal official in Cartagena, said authorities were waiting for more details on the alleged scandal because Cartagena has no confirmation that local people were involved. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, said he is in close touch with Sullivan and believes he is taking ""serious action"" to investigate the incident. The Secret Service agents and officers being investigated range in experience from relative newcomers to nearly 20-year veterans, two government officials with knowledge of the investigation said Monday. Each agent was offered an opportunity to take a polygraph test, according to a U.S. official. Some of the agents and military personnel maintain they didn't know the women were prostitutes, the official said. Even so, King said, ""it was totally wrong to take a foreign national back to a hotel when the president is about to arrive."" House Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, said he has a high level of confidence in Sullivan. While soliciting prostitution is in most cases legal for adults in Colombia, it is considered a breach of the Secret Service's conduct code, government sources said. Military law also bars service members from patronizing prostitutes, engaging in conduct unbecoming an officer or, for enlisted personnel, conduct ""prejudicial to good order and discipline."" The military personnel allegedly involved were sent to Colombia to support the Secret Service. A military official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation told CNN that two of those being questioned are Marines and that Air Force and Navy personnel also are being questioned. CNN's National Security Contributor Fran Townsend, Juan Carlos Lopez, Dana Bash, Bob Kovach, John King, Barbara Starr, Jessica Yellin, Deirdre Walsh, Ted Barrett and journalist Fernando Ramos contributed to this report.","NEW: Rep.

"(CNN) -- A Karim Benzema brace helped Real Madrid to a 3-0 win over Sevilla on Sunday to edge Jose Mourinho's side one step closer to a first La Liga title in four seasons. The French striker's goals early in the second half added to Cristiano Ronaldo's 19th minute strike to maintain their seven-point lead at the top of the table with three games remaining. It was the perfect tonic for Real after they were knocked out of the Champions League on penalties by Bayern Munich on Wednesday. ""It was an important win and the team deserves to be champions as the players have shown their mentality and character,"" said Aitor Karanka, Real Madrid's assistant coach. ""We will go out looking to win games even when we are the champions, if that happens, as we only have one plan.

Pedro fired in a rebound after Messi headed against the bar at the start of the second half and Thiago scored a fifth 11 minutes from the end. Pedro bagged a second three minutes from time but it was left to Lionel Messi to complete the rout as he scored his second in the 90th minute. Earlier, sixth-placed Atletico Madrid scored in the third minute of injury time to salvage a 2-2 draw at Real Betis, but the result does little to enhance the Europa League finalists' chances of gaining a Champions League spot next season.

"(CNN) -- Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi is expected to meet Tuesday with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, a day after she said she would take the oath of office for the country's parliament after initially resisting it. The impasse over the oath had been preventing her and other newly elected members of her party from taking their seats in the legislature. ""I will go to the parliament because there is a demand of people who voted for me,"" Suu Kyi said after meeting with party members in Yangon on Monday. She and 42 other members of her party, the National League for Democracy, were elected in by-elections earlier this month. They had been delaying their debuts in parliament because they objected to the wording of the oath they would have to take. The NLD had asked the authorities to amend the oath to say that members will ""abide by"" the constitution rather than ""protect"" it. Party members want to revise the constitution, which they view as undemocratic. But the government of President Thein Sein, a former military official, didn't appear to show any sign of moving to accommodate the request. Suu Kyi, who spent years under house arrest, said Monday that she would ""take an oath for the country and for the people."" She added that she had been urged to enter parliament by some parliament members and representatives of Myanmar's ethnic minority groups. Asked whether she was concerned she may appear weak by backing down over the oath, Suu Kyi said, ""I don't care."" Nyan Win, a spokesman for the NLD, said Suu Kyi will attend parliament in the capital, Naypyidaw, on Wednesday for ""just one day."" The breakthrough came while the U.N. chief Ban was in Myanmar. He met with top officials, including Thein Sein, on Monday and offered U.N. support. He is scheduled to meet Tuesday with Suu-Kyi. The international organization is available to provide technical assistance for Myanmar's first census in 2014 and lend its electoral expertise in the run-up to the 2015 elections, the United Nations said. Ban is the latest in a string of high-profile officials to visit the country as it emerges from decades of international isolation. Myanmar's authoritarian military rulers are loosening their grip on power after decades of stifling dissent and limiting freedoms. In the past 12 months, the government has pardoned hundreds of political prisoners, secured a cease-fire with Karen rebels and agreed to negotiate with other ethnic rebel groups. The success of Suu Kyi and her party at the by-elections this month was welcomed by the United States and European Union as a sign of progress toward democracy. The dispute over the wording of the oath appeared to create an early stumbling block in that process. But Suu Kyi said last week that she did not want the issue to become ""political,"" insisting that it was a ""technical"" problem. Her arrival in parliament on Wednesday will illustrate the pace at which Myanmar is changing: She was released from house arrest less than a year and a half ago. Control of parliament will not change despite the opposition's strong performance, but the entry of the NLD members will nonetheless give the party a notable presence. Myanmar's legislature has 664 seats, more than 80% of which are still held by lawmakers aligned with the military-backed ruling group, the Union Solidarity and Development Party. Many Western governments have taken steps to ease sanctions on Myanmar, also known as Burma, in response to its political reforms. But international officials have also cautioned that the country still has a long way to go. Speaking last week ahead of his trip, the United Nations' Ban said that Myanmar's ""fresh start is still fragile.""","Aung San Suu Kyi and her party object to wording of the swearing-in oath in parliament .

""The recommended sentence is appropriate to reflect the essential role that Mr. Taylor played in crimes of such extreme scope and gravity,"" said the prosecutor's report. ""It also reflects the critical and unique contributions Mr. Taylor made to the crimes. But for Charles Taylor's criminal conduct, thousands of people would not have had limbs amputated, would not have been raped, would not have been killed. Further, the recommended sentence provides fair and adequate response to the outrage these crimes caused in victims, their families and relatives, the Sierra Leonean people and the world at large."" Last week's landmark ruling by the international tribunal was the first war crimes conviction of a former head of state by an international court since the Nuremberg trials of Nazi leaders after World War II. Prosecutors, however, failed to prove that Taylor had direct command over the rebels who committed the atrocities, said Justice Richard Lussick of the Special Court for Sierra Leone. A three-judge panel issued a unanimous decision that Taylor, 64, was guilty on all 11 counts of the indictment against him. The judges found him guilty of aiding and abetting rebel forces in a campaign of terror that involved murder, rape, sexual slavery, conscripting children younger than 15 and mining diamonds to pay for guns. There is no death penalty in international criminal law, and Taylor would serve out any sentence in a British prison. Taylor's lawyer, Courtenay Griffiths, suggested the trial was politically motivated. He claimed his client's conviction was ""obtained on tainted and corrupted evidence"" based on the testimony of witnesses from Sierra Leone who were paid to appear in court. Griffiths portrayed Taylor as a legitimate leader who aided rebels in a neighboring nation. Those rebels, not Taylor, should be held accountable for their actions, the lawyer contended. U.N. human rights chief Navi Pillay noted that Taylor can appeal the verdict, and it could be overturned. That said, she called his conviction ""immensely significant,"" saying it sends out a message that even the most powerful are not above the law. ""This is undoubtedly a historic moment in the development of international justice,"" she said. ""A former president, who once wielded immense influence in a neighboring country where tens of thousands of people were killed, mutilated, raped, robbed and repeatedly displaced for years on end, has been arrested, tried in a fair and thorough international procedure."" Taylor has been a pivotal figure in Liberian politics for decades after he overthrew the regime of Samuel Doe in 1989, plunging the country into a bloody civil war that left 200,000 dead over the next 14 years. After he was forced out of office under international pressure in 2003, he lived in exile in Nigeria, where border guards arrested him in 2006 as he was attempting to cross into Chad amid international pressure. That culminated in his trial, which began in 2007 at the special court for Sierra Leone in The Hague, Netherlands. U.N. officials and the Sierra Leone government jointly set up the tribunal to try those who played the biggest role in the atrocities. The court was moved from Sierra Leone, where emotions about the civil war still run high. Prosecutors accused Taylor of financing and giving orders to Revolutionary United Front rebels in Sierra Leone's civil war that ultimately left 50,000 dead or missing. His support for the rebels fueled the bloody war, prosecutors said. Fighters included teenagers forced to kill, rape and plunder placed under the influence of drugs to provoke violent behavior. Witnesses testified about grisly violence by the rebels during the conflict, including shooting and disemboweling pregnant women and children. Sometimes, rebels asked people if they wanted long sleeves or short sleeves. The former meant hacking off hands; the latter, forearms. Taylor becomes the first former head of state since Adm. Karl Doenitz, who became president of Germany briefly after Adolf Hitler's suicide, to be convicted of war crimes or crimes against humanity by an international tribunal. Former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was tried by an international tribunal but died before a judgment was issued. The International Criminal Court has charged Laurent Gbagbo, the former Ivory Coast president, with crimes against humanity. It also has a warrant out for Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, who, so far, has been able to elude arrest.

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Bad weather hampered recovery efforts Friday as rescue teams combed a forbidding slope of an Indonesian mountain where a Russian jetliner crashed on a demonstration flight this week. Rescuers found 12 bodies early in the day, according to Vice Marshal Daryatmo, head of the National Search and Rescue Agency, who like many Indonesians uses only one name. It will take at least two weeks to identify the victims through DNA tests, Indonesian authorities said. All 45 on board the Sukhoi Superjet 100 are feared dead. The Superjet 100, Russia's newest passenger plane, slammed into Mount Salak, a volcano south of Jakarta, after disappearing from radar screens Wednesday. Most of the wreckage is on a steep slope about 6,000 feet high, making it difficult to reach. The cause of the crash remained unclear. The Russian Investigative Committee said it has launched a criminal probe into possible safety violations. ""We can understand how the families are feeling right now, and we want to do this evacuation as fast as we can, but the problem is the crash site terrain is unreachable by parachute,"" Daryatmo said at a news conference Friday. Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono announced a joint investigation Friday after a phone call with his Russia counterpart, Vladimir Putin. ""I welcome the offer from Russian President Putin because the goal is to investigate what could have caused the plane crash,"" Yudhoyono said. The Russian Investigative Committee had said 48 people were on board the plane, including eight Russian crew members. But the Russian state-run news agency RIA Novosti said the number was 45, citing Sukhoi Civil Aviation President Vladimir Prisyazhnyuk as saying three of the people on the passenger list did not board the flight. The plane was on a demonstration flight for Indonesian Ministry of Transportation officials and representatives of Indonesian airlines, the Russian Embassy in Jakarta said before the crash. Indonesia's Sky Aviation signed a $380 million deal in 2011 to buy 12 Sukhoi Superjet 100s, and press reports said a number of Sky employees were on the plane that went down. Sukhoi employees are also among the missing. It was the first crash of a Sukhoi Superjet 100, RIA Novosti said. The plane was on its second demonstration flight Wednesday when it lost contact with air controllers at Jakarta's Halim Perdanakusuma Airport. The Sukhoi jet arrived in Jakarta as part of a demonstration tour of six Asian countries. It had been to Myanmar, Pakistan and Kazakhstan, and was scheduled to visit Laos and Vietnam after Indonesia, RIA Novosti said. Sukhoi manufactures military aircraft and is known especially for its fighter jets. Its civilian aircraft is narrow-bodied with a dual-class cabin that can transport 100 passengers over regional routes. It flew its maiden flight in 2008 and has had encountered problems in the past. In March, a Superjet 100 operated by Russia's Aeroflot Airlines was forced to abandon its flight to Astrakhan, Russia, and return to Moscow because of problems with the undercarriage, according to RIA Novosti. A similar defect in another Aeroflot-operated Superjet 100 plane had to be fixed in Minsk in December. However, Russia's state-run United Aircraft Corp. said the defect did not affect passenger safety. CNN's Kathy Quiano in Jakarta and Alla Eshchenko in Moscow contributed to this report.","Recovery efforts are hampered by high elevation and bad weather .

"(CNN) -- An undercover video shows horses being struck with sticks and subjected to ""soring,"" an illegal process in which chemicals are placed on their lower legs in an effort to induce the signature Tennessee Walking Horse high-stepping gait. The graphic video shows trainer Jackie L. McConnell of Whitter Stables of Collierville, Tennessee, and others subjecting show horses to practices that were banned 40 years ago. One image shows a writhing horse being subjected to a whip at McConnell's barn. Another receives a shock to the head. The video, made by a Humane Society of the United States investigator, was first featured Wednesday on the ABC News program ""Nightline."" It has raised questions of how pervasive the training techniques are despite recent prosecutions and investigations by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which enforces the Horse Protection Act. ""There obviously is a huge problem,"" said Jonathan Lovvorn, senior vice president for litigation and investigations with the Humane Society. ""In the competition to get this unnatural gait, trainers are using banned substances to cheat."" Horse show judges value the exaggerated gait, called the ""big lick."" Shows in Tennessee and elsewhere annually draw thousands of spectators. PepsiCo on Thursday confirmed it had pulled its sponsorship of this summer's Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration. Asked if the sponsorship decision was in response to the 2011 video, PepsiCo spokesperson Vincent Bozek said, ""That's all we're saying."" The decision was made Wednesday. The president of a Tennessee horse industry organization, condemning the ""disturbing"" video, told CNN there is a stringent inspection process at shows. ""I think it's sad that a corporation like Pepsi would go out because of the action of one person and one training barn,"" said Dr. Stephen Mullins of S.H.O.W. Jane Velez Mitchell: Abuse of high-stepping horses must end . McConnell and three other men were named in a 52-count federal indictment earlier this year. According to a defense filing in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee, McConnell will plead guilty next week to a count of conspiracy to violate the Horse Protection Act. McConnell's attorney, Tom Greenholtz of Chattanooga, confirmed to CNN that his client is wielding a stick on a horse in a portion of the video. Greenholtz said he could not comment at this time on the specifics of the case or McConnell's view of the allegations. McConnell faces a maximum five-year prison sentence and expects the government to dismiss the other counts, the attorney said. According to the indictment, ""soring is a cruel and inhumane practice used to accentuate a horse's gait in order to gain a competitive edge in horse shows."" Chemicals and other irritants on a horse's ankles and forelegs cause it to lift its front feet and shift its weight unnaturally to the hind legs in order to relieve the pain, the indictment states. The Humane Society said its investigator documented ""stewarding"" â€” training a horse not to react to pain during official show inspections of their legs for soreness -- by striking them in the head when they flinch during mock inspections. The video was filmed in spring 2011 by an investigator who worked two months as a stablehand at McConnell's barn, according to the Humane Society. Lovvorn told CNN the society shared the video and results of its investigation with federal prosecutors before the indictment was returned. In separate cases, a seven-month investigation conducted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture resulted in at least four other Tennessee men being sentenced this year for horse soring violations. One defendant sentenced to 12 months in prison and a $4,000 fine described how chemical irritants, chains, bolts and other devices were used to bring about the exaggerated gait. ""He stressed the pervasiveness of soring in the gaited horse industry and testified that horses 'have got to be sored to walk,'"" according to a press release from the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Tennessee. S.H.O.W., certified by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), handles inspections of Tennessee horses at events. Mullins, a retired equine veterinarian, said self-regulation by the industry has led to three lifetime and 150 one-year suspensions for soring and other violations of the Horse Protection Act. Trainers shouldn't rely on soring to train horses to hit the ""big lick,"" said Mullins, acknowledging the industry still has problems. ""I was given one charge (task). Get rid of the sore horse. I think we are well on our way."" One painless training technique, he said, is to fit pads, about 3 inches tall, below the horse's hoof. ""It can change the way the horse lands on its foot,"" according to Mullins. ""It requires him to exaggerate and keep his foot up for a longer period of time."" S.H.OW.'s oversight, however, does not extend to training facilities and barns. ""Soring is a way to take a horse that is not very good ... to make him look good,"" said Mullins. ""Do I think it goes on around the trainers who show routinely with me? No sir, I do not believe it does."" Lovvorn, of the Humane Society, said soring ""has been an open secret in Tennessee for years."" Prosecutions, a stringent update of the Horse Protection Act and recently approved additional resources for the Agriculture Department are key, he said. A 2010 Office of Inspector General audit within the USDA pointed out the need for more funding of federal inspections and shortcomings and inconsistencies of those done by people associated with horse industry organizations. The Tennessee Walking Horse Breeders' and Exhibitors' Association, in a statement Thursday, said it reaffirmed its opposition to violations of the Horse Protection Act. ""The walking horse holds an inherent natural gait that has been in existence for nearly 100 years,"" said group President Marty Irby. ""(The association) adopted a zero tolerance policy in regards to soring a number of years ago and has recently challenged every member to adopt a zero tolerance policy themselves."" CNN's Dave Alsup contributed to this report.","Defense attorney has no comment on specific charges against his client .

"(CNN) -- Violence and the resulting displaced people have created a crisis in Mali that is the worst in its recent history, a new report by Amnesty International says. Fighting in northern Mali has resulted in hundreds of thousands of displaced people, the human rights organization said. Many have been subjected to arbitrary detention, extrajudicial executions or sexual violence, the report found. Since the beginning of 2012, the report found, Mali has faced a situation that has ""questioned both the integrity of its territory as well as almost 20 years of political stability."" Fighters arriving from Libya in early 2012 fueled a Tuareg rebellion that included attacks against Malian outposts in the north of the country, the report said. The rebels are accused of violating international humanitarian law because they executed soldiers they caught in combat. According to Amnesty, the Malian army responded by bombing indiscriminately to civilian areas. Disaster looms for people of Mali as country is split by revolt . Adding to the country's woes, in March, a group of noncommissioned officers took power after a military coup. The new government suspended the constitution and arrested political leaders, Amnesty reported. While the military leaders sought legitimacy for their government, the armed groups took over northern Mali. ""After two decades of relative stability and peace, Mali is now facing its worst crisis since independence in 1960,"" Gaetan Mootoo, Amnesty International's West Africa researcher, said in a statement. ""The entire north of the country has been taken over by armed groups who are running riot. Tens of thousands of people have fled the region, creating a humanitarian crisis in Mali and in neighboring countries."" As of May, there were about 130,000 internally displaced people in Mali and an additional 190,000 who fled to neighboring countries as refugees, the report states. Amnesty International spoke with witnesses who talked about women and girls being raped by armed men and found child soldiers among the ranks of the Tuareg. Meanwhile, Malian security forces are accused of killing unarmed people. According to the organization, all parties in the conflict have committed human rights violations.","Rebels have taken over northern Mali .

"Washington (CNN) -- The campaign to feed the world's poor will get some much needed star power Friday when Bono, co-founder of the global advocacy organization ONE, arrives to rally leaders of the Group of Eight industrialized nations to take action. While the crisis in the eurozone will no doubt top the agenda when the G8 leaders gather Friday for a two-day summit, the talks will also tackle the issue of food security and ways to feed a growing world population. At their annual summit in L'Aquila, Italy, in 2009, leaders pledged to provide $20 billion to fight hunger in the developing world over three years. Since then, U.S. President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have embraced food security as a signature foreign policy issue, working to support farmers in Africa and other developing countries to improve agriculture. Now, those 2009 commitments are set to expire. In an age of shrinking aid budgets with fewer resources available, donor governments can't solve the problem of world hunger alone. Rajiv Shah, administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, said in an interview that major gains have been made in reducing hunger in most of the world, with the exception of sub-Saharan Africa. While he said the private sector has been interested in developing the African market, companies have been reluctant because of corruption and a lack of infrastructure. ""They had the sense leaders are not committed,"" Shah said of the private sector. Since L'Aquila, 30 African governments have developed internationally endorsed plans for investment in food security and agricultural development. Their commitment to policy reforms to create a better climate for investors, Shah said, has created an interest in investing, with a focus on small farms. ""These policy reform commitments are unlocking the potential of agriculture to explode and ending the perception of Africa,"" Shah said. ""African leaders are replacing the vision of hunger with growth and opportunity."" Before a G8 session at the summit on food security with the leaders of Benin, Ethiopia, Ghana and Tanzania, Bono will join Obama, Clinton and other leaders in government, business, nonprofits and academia to discuss goals for eradicating world hunger . Obama will address the symposium in Washington of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, where administration officials say he will unveil a new G8 food security ""alliance"" to advance global agricultural development in Africa that includes the private sector and other key players. ""We have recognized that it is eight to 10 times more expensive to feed people when they are in crisis than it does to help farmers feed themselves and build better resources,"" Shah said. ""If we can be innovative in the private sector, we can have much better outcomes."" Over the last several months, Shah said, the effort has secured more than $3 billion in concrete private investment commitments, almost half of which came from African companies. On Friday, Shah said, 35 companies are expected to make additional commitments for projects ranging from manufacturing fertilizer plants and building storage facilities to providing mobile phones to help farmers use mobile banking and other services to cut out middlemen and become part of a cash economy. ""Historically, the private sector has not been as active in the agriculture space as it should be, but that is starting to change"" said Ben Leo, global policy director of the ONE Campaign. ""There is enormous potential when you have donor countries and the private sector working with African government in support of these country plans. That is where magic can happen."" Advocacy groups hope the G8 will shift its focus from money to meeting concrete goals on hunger and nutrition, including lifting 50 million people out of poverty and preventing stunted development of 15 million children over the next 10 years. While praising the efforts of the private sector and recognizing the potential multiplier effect, some advocacy groups voice concern that without the involvement of nongovernmental organizations, the resources will not reach the poorest who are most in need. Sam Worthington, the head of InterAction, an alliance of U.S.-based relief and development groups, says the focus should be on small plots of land for farmers to feed their families and have disposable income to participate in the local economy. ""Africa is becoming a big new market. How that market is developed will make a big difference in the lives of its poorest farmers,"" he said. ""You will need multinational companies to drive the development of the market, but you will need just as much the voice of local groups providing checks and balances to help ensure the market is supporting the needs of local shareholders.""","Europe's crisis will top G8 meeting agenda Friday, but talks will also focus on world hunger .
As commitments expire, donor governments won't be able to solve hunger problem alone .

"(CNN) -- Kimberly Brewer's most memorable Father's Day was the one when she realized how much she would miss him. It was 2005, less than two months after retired naval corpsman Wallace J. Keyser had died unexpectedly of complications from pneumonia. Her heart sank while she watched Father's Day-themed commercials. She remembers walking through Barnes & Noble and seeing a World War II title that he would love and realizing there was no need to buy it. ""That is the most memorable Father's Day ever, to realize the impact of loss and yet cherish the gifts given by that very same devastation,"" said Brewer, who shared her story on CNN iReport. ""I missed him that Father's Day and every day since, but count myself as oh so fortunate to have had such an amazing man in my life."" It's easy to write off Father's Day as yet another meaningless Hallmark holiday until you no longer have someone to send a card to. For those people, the day can be bittersweet, a reminder of the good times and all the times you'll never again share. And for others, the day is an opportunity to celebrate all the ways dads make our lives better. Read more tributes to fathers from iReporters . Brewer's father inspired her to join the Air Force and push on to become a captain select. She shares his love of cars, Nissans in particular, and recently bought her dream car, a loaded Maxima. Yet, she couldn't help but feel sad that she couldn't share it with him. A child of the Depression who lived through the Korean and Vietnam Wars and Hurricane Isabel, he taught her a lesson or two in resilience. After he retired from the Navy, he went to college on the GI Bill and became the first person in his family to get a degree. Missing a dad on Father's Day can evoke the ache of loss, but some rely on happy memories to get through the day. Carla Hurst-Chandler remembers when the family surprised her husband with the gift of a lifetime for Father's Day. William Edward Chandler was smitten with an antique classic Guild Guitar that he'd spotted at their local music store in Greencastle, Indiana. Carla made a deal with the proprietor to make small payments on the $1,000 guitar with her sons so it would be theirs in time for Father's Day 1996. When the son surpasses his father . For weeks, she stopped in and paid installments for the guitar, along with and her sons, ages 7, 8 and 9, who pitched in part of their weekly allowances, Hurst-Chandler said in an iReport. Rod, the store owner, was in on the plot too, she said. When her husband stopped by to see his coveted guitar, Rod shook his head and told him it had been sold. ""That night was the hardest of all, when he came home and glumly remarked that it had sold,"" she said. ""And the boys and I commiserated with him, knowing that it was sold all right ... to us."" When Father's Day arrived, they were up early as he slept in. When he came down for breakfast, he walked into the kitchen and found the guitar case open to reveal his dream guitar. ""The look on his face, the double-take, the happiness, was priceless!"" she said. ""The boys and I lost Bill to leukemia in 2010 and spent many wonderful Father's Days with him between these years. But this was his best Father's Day surprise ever."" Paul Olmstead's children imbue Father's Day with new meaning for him. But he still wishes his father were around to enjoy his three sons. Duane D. Olmstead was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2001 and told he had six to 12 months to live, Paul Olmstead said in an iReport. He didn't want to try chemotherapy or radiation and decided to see what a raw, vegan diet would do for him. He ended up living for five more years, during which his relationship with his family changed dramatically, Paul Olmstead said. My Father's Day wish: Curious children . ""We always had a good relationship, but not super close where we shared intimate things or I would ask for his advice. That changed fairly quickly after his diagnosis,"" he said. ""It softened him a bit."" Paul Olmstead said he also learned from the experience. It strengthened his faith and prompted some changes to his diet: less sugar and processed foods, more fruits, vegetables and whole grains, though his family is not vegan. From fat dad to ultra-fit father . The importance of hard work and family has also taken on a new meaning, he said. ""My dad left a legacy to me, my three siblings and our families that we should value our work or whatever we are doing. Don't just work hard; do quality work. Be able to look at what you've done and be proud of it because you know you gave it your best effort,"" he said. ""He taught us also to always be there for each other. At the end of the day, you need to be able to count on family, and we were truly and still are very much a close family today."" For better or worse, sometimes it takes a near-death experience to remind us of life's fragility. For Kathi Ross and her family, this Father's Day will be a time to celebrate how her husband saved her son's life. Her 6-year-old son, Lane, was pushing his bike into the garage in April when somehow, the family's SUV lurched forward and pinned him underneath the front passenger tire. Beneath him was his bike wheel, which was folded over ""like a taco,"" Ross said. ""I started immediately screaming and praying at the same time,"" said the fifth-grade teacher from Catawba, South Carolina, who shared her story on CNN iReport. Luckily, her husband, a police officer, had come home early from work. Chuck Ross was upstairs changing when he heard his wife scream and immediately ran downstairs in his underwear and bulletproof vest. He jumped in the car and backed it off his son. Lane had lost consciousness, and his skin had taken on an ashy, purple tone by the time his father knelt and started performing CPR. Just when Ross thought it was over, her son started coughing up grassy-looking material. Her son would later tell her that he remembers being asleep when he heard someone telling him to breathe. ""I woke up, and it was my daddy, so I thought I better listen!"" he told his mother. An ambulance arrived and took him 30 minutes down the road to Charlotte, North Carolina, where he was treated for lacerations to his kidney and liver. Miraculously, he was out of the hospital a week later and playing baseball a few weeks after that. Bridging the intellectual divide with Dad . He still has scars on his legs and belly, a small price to pay for a miracle, his mother said. Now, the bond between father and son is stronger than ever. Ross credits her husband's police training with saving her son's life. Had he still been a homebuilder, making much more money than he does now, he might not have known what to do. He joined the force after losing his job in the recession. ""A lot of the time, (police) get a bad name, but you never hear about the good they do,"" she said. ""Their training helps them help people on a daily basis, whether they're in uniform or out of uniform."" Brewer speaks of her father in heroic terms, too. Like many veterans of his era, he seemed to harbor guilt for having survived Vietnam and Korea. She once asked him whether he was a hero, and he told her no, because ""only the cowards came home,"" she said. Before his death, she made arrangements for his burial in Arlington, at the veterans cemetery, and made it to his hospital room in time to tell him that he'd be in good company because ""there are no cowards in Arlington, as all America knows,"" she said. This Father's Day, she'll call her mother and brothers and toast her father's memory with a Bacardi and Coke, his favorite drink. Maybe she'll remember when he walked her down the aisle at her wedding even though he could barely walk and pulled back her veil, kissed her cheek and told her to ""be good."" ""Many of us ... are out of daddies at our houses. That doesn't make Father's Day any less special; in some ways, it means even more. I'm so blessed to have the memories of the father I had, even if we don't have him here anymore.""

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- A massive earthquake struck off the coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra on Wednesday afternoon, triggering a tsunami watch for the Indian Ocean, which was later canceled. The quake struck about 434 kilometers (270 miles) southwest of Banda Aceh, the capital of Indonesia's Aceh province, and had a magnitude of 8.6, the U.S. Geological Survey said. It took place at a depth of 23 kilometers (14 miles). A second large quake, with a magnitude of 8.2, occurred off the west coast of Sumatra about two hours later, the USGS said. Gary Gibson from the Seismology Research Center in Melbourne, Australia, said the location of the second quake reduced the possibility of a tsunami. There was also a series of smaller quakes off the west coast of northern Sumatra with magnitudes between 5.1 and 5.4. There were no reports of destruction or deaths. Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said on local television that there were no reports of casualties or damage in Aceh. Four people were slightly injured on Simeulue Island, off the coast of Aceh, the National Disaster Management Agency said Wednesday. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center issued a tsunami watch for the entire Indian Ocean. And a few hours later, the center announced the tsunami watch was canceled. ""A significant tsunami was generated by this earthquake. However, sea level readings now indicate that the threat has diminished or is over for most areas,"" the center said. How are earthquakes measured? The center earlier said that ""when no major waves have occurred for at least two hours after the estimated arrival time or damaging waves have not occurred for at least two hours, then local authorities can assume the threat is passed."" The center posted approximate arrival times for waves in different parts of the region, which were predicted at various times in different cities throughout the day. Waves were reported at 1-meter (about 3.3-foot) amplitude -- or height above sea level -- offshore in Meulaboh, Indonesia, but in other cities, they were reported at about a foot or less, according to the warning center. British Prime Minister David Cameron announced that Britain ""stands ready to help if required."" The first quake took place at 2:38 p.m. local time (4:38 a.m. ET). It appears to have involved a horizontal movement rather than a vertical movement, so it is less likely that it will generate a tsunami, Gibson said. He also said that the tremor took place a long way offshore and was therefore unlikely to have caused much damage. Still, officials called on coastal residents in some low-lying areas in the region to seek higher ground. The power went out in Banda Aceh, and residents moved to higher elevations, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian National Disaster Management Agency. The areas most at risk of a tsunami are coastal areas of Aceh, particularly the island of Simeulue, Prih Harjadi, an official for the Indonesian geophysics agency, said on Metro TV. In some areas, residents were allowed to return after the tsunami watch was lifted. In Thailand, the National Disaster Warning Center issued an evacuation order for residents and tourists along the Andaman coast, state-run news agency MCOT said. ""The tremor was felt as far as in Bangkok where office workers at several high-rise buildings said their workplaces were shaken"" for three to five minutes, the report said. ""Several southern provinces also felt the tremors."" In the Maldives, some resorts were evacuated in advance of possible waves, according to CNN's Erin Burnett, who was on vacation in the region. ""What strikes me most is essentially the lack of a warning system"" in the Maldives, she said. Officials rely primarily on information from the USGS, Burnett said. Interactive: World's deadliest earthquakes . In 2004, a 9.1-magnitude underwater earthquake off the coast of Sumatra triggered a tsunami that killed more than 200,000 people in 14 countries. The majority of the deaths were in Indonesia, with Aceh bearing the brunt. That quake took place 250 kilometers (155 miles) south-southeast of Banda Aceh at a depth of 30 kilometers (19 miles). The tsunami, which washed away entire communities, caused nearly $10 billion in damage and more casualties than any other tsunami in history, according to the United Nations. Since then, officials have worked to improve warning systems and have carried out drills in the region. Indonesia is on the so-called Ring of Fire, an arc of fault lines circling the Pacific Basin that is prone to frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The earthquake Wednesday comes just over year after a magnitude-9 quake off the northeast coast of Japan caused a devastating tsunami. The death toll from that disaster stands at about 15,850. iReport: Earthquake in Dhaka .

"(CNN) -- Swedish Crown Princess Victoria gave birth to a baby girl early Thursday, the Royal Court announced. The baby girl is now second in line to the throne of Sweden, as the first grandchild of the king and queen, the court said on its website. Her mother is first. The father, Prince Daniel -- the former personal trainer of the crown princess -- was present at the Karolinska hospital in Stockholm during the birth, the court said. The child's name will be announced Friday or Saturday, her father said. Visibly moved, the prince described the baby as ""a very cute princess"" in an appearance on Swedish television Thursday morning. ""Well, when I came down from the room, the little princess was laying on her mother's chest, and it looked like they were having a very cozy time, so it was hard to take my eyes off them,"" he said on CNN affiliate TV4. ""The Crown Princess is feeling fantastic, she is so happy and everything has worked out well and the little daughter and the Crown Princess are feeling very well,"" he said. Admitting he was ""very nervous"" during the birth, he said ""everything has worked out well,"" and thanked the hospital staff for the ""wonderful care they have provided us."" ""And I would also like to thank everyone who for the last nine months have shared our joy, which we have really appreciated,"" he said. The baby weighed 3280 grams (7 pounds, 3 ounces) and was 51 cm (20 inches) long, the Royal Court said.","The child is second in line to the Swedish throne, after her mother .

"(CNN) -- Iran's finance minister believes oil prices could rise as high as $160 a barrel thanks to sanctions over its nuclear program, a prediction that comes just as the chief of the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency headed to Tehran on Sunday for high-level talks. ""We must pay close attention when we speak of oil revenues and sanctions against oil sales, who are the winners and the losers of such sanctions?"" Shamseddin Hosseini told CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria GPS"" in an interview that airs Sunday. ""Indeed, it is difficult. But not just for Iran. And we can all rest assured that there will be a considerable increase in international oil market prices. Now, is this the best approach?"" The comments came as the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a carefully worded statement that its director-general, Yukiya Amano, was headed to Iran for talks on what it described only as ""issues of mutual interest with high Iranian officials."" The trip raises speculation that Iran may be willing to grant IAEA inspectors access to sites to determine whether it is developing nuclear weapons. The talks come at a critical time for Iran, whose economy has been crippled by sanctions imposed by the United Nations, the United States and the European Union. Eighty percent of Iran's foreign revenues are derived from oil exports, and an embargo by the EU set to go into effect in July will further devastate its economy. But Hosseini said the embargo would also likely hurt the EU, which is grappling with its own weakened economy. Oil prices as a result of the sanctions, he said, ""will go considerably higher than $100 per barrel."" Even the International Monetary Fund ""says as a result of these sanctions, oil prices will perhaps reach and hover around $160 per barrel,"" he said. Hosseini gave little indication to Zakaria that Iran would be willing to abandon its nuclear program, which Tehran has consistently maintained is solely for the development of alternative energy. ""There are conversations and dialogues taking place currently, but there cannot be a hegemony and a double-standard in the treatment of member countries such as Iran,"" he said. ""If these principles can be understood and applied with mutual respect, I think we will be in a much better place. If we don't, we will witness a increase in international oil markets."" The Iranians met with the IAEA for the first time in three months in Vienna, Austria, last week and are expected to meet again Monday. Later this week in Baghdad, Iran is set to continue talks over its nuclear program with world powers who make up the group known as P5+1: the United States, France, Russia, China, Britain and Germany. Tensions over the country's nuclear program have roiled the Middle East, with Iran threatening earlier this year to close the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil shipping lane, if sanctions were imposed on its exports of crude oil. Meanwhile, Israel has said it may attack Iran to prevent it from developing nuclear weapons. During the height of tensions, oil prices soared to $110 a barrel. The price per barrel of crude oil finished last week at $92.50 per barrel. In March, the IAEA noted what it called a sharp and troubling increase in Iran's uranium enrichment capabilities. The United States and its allies suspect that Iran is evading international inspections and is developing nuclear weapons. As punishment, Western nations have slapped crippling sanctions on Iran. Leaders of the so-called Group of Eight -- United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Japan and Russia -- called on Iran on Saturday to comply with the requirements of the U.N.'s watchdog agency to open its doors to nuclear inspectors. In a declaration, the G8 leaders said they welcomed the resumption of talks. The leaders called on Iran to engage ""in detailed discussion about near-term, concrete steps that can, through a step-by-step approach based on reciprocity, lead towards a comprehensive negotiated solution which restores international confidence that Iran's nuclear program is exclusively peaceful,"" according to the declaration. The G8 leaders also urged Iran to comply with international obligations to uphold human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the freedom of religion.","Iran's finance minister tells CNN that oil prices could rise as high as $160 a barrel .

"(CNN) -- More than 2,700 CNN readers have shared what they think of Osama bin Laden's letters which were released Thursday. Many who left comments said they were fascinated that bin Laden had apparently been strategizing about how to promote al Qaeda using media, and how his approach seems similar to any marketing agency or political party. Others carefully read the full documents CNN posted and responded with a variety of theories about them. The total pages released Thursday were a drop in the bucket compared to the trove the U.S. government says it confiscated from the Pakistan compound where bin Laden was killed in May 2011. Thursday's release included 17 letters totaling 175 pages. Officials said they would release the remaining documents later, but would not say when. Bin Laden's marketing focus . Bin Laden's letters showed he was focused on how al Qaeda could use the media to attract more members. For example, he recommended to followers that al Qaeda consider reaching out to Al Jazeera and U.S. media to deliver the terror group's message on the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. Bin Laden's writings also reveal he wanted to launch a publicity campaign to draw people to al Qaeda who ""have not yet revolted"" during the Arab Spring uprisings. CNN reader Breck Archer said: ""Interesting to see how much emphasis bin Laden placed on the media campaign. Crafting messages to incite revolt for the 10th anniversery of 9/11 and during the Arab spring seemed to be a priority of his while holed up in his compound. Trying to implement the media as a weapons system while popping Viagra and dying his beard as the fledgling Al Qaeda network crumbled around him."" Poster tinwatchman weighed in: ""The war against al Qaeda has never really been just about the bombs and guns. It's been fought inside people's heads. We're not just fighting Bin Laden, we're fighting the story that he's telling people: that this war is against Islam and Muslims, that it's like the Crusades come all over again, and that any Muslim who wants dignity and freedom by definition must be against the United States, when the truth of the matter is -- at our best, anyway -- the United States really doesn't *care* what religion you are..."" ZerkWerk, another reader, thought about who might be listening to bin Laden's message. ""I felt like a filthy devil just reading what little I did. Makes me sick to think that people read that tripe and believed it."" Rebranding al Qaeda . Other readers were intrigued by an al Qaeda memo discussing changing the group's name which means ""The Base"" and is associated with mujahedeen battles with the Russians in 1980s Afghanistan. Al Qaeda thought it might be better to go with, for example, ""Jihad Group."" ""Bin Laden was worried that the name made it too easy to disassociate Al-Qaeda from Islam -- and thus from Bin Laden's self-appointed position as Islam's representative. Doing so allowed Obama and the US to move away from the kind of 'cosmic war' between Christianity and Islam that Bush wound up falling into during the Iraq war,"" tinwatchman wrote. ""That holy war pattern is something that Bin Laden was entirely comfortable with -- something he thrived on. In a lot of ways, taking that story away from him is one of the most important moves Obama made."" Poster Payton Stone said it was ""jarring"" to hear the word ""brand"" used in reference to al Qaeda. ""On one level, one could consider it an abomination to use this word so casually. A terrorist organization is far different than a toothpaste."" ""I believe we should use language which draws distinctions between methods utilized by institutions of horrific violence and those deploying commonplace capitalist methodologies,"" Stone wrote. ""While it may contribute to establishing a commentators cognoscenti credentials to re-purpose common words in this way, one should be ever vigilant in thinking carefully about how the use or words can positively or negatively impact our perceptions of the world."" Theorists and skeptics . Several commenters suspected the U.S. government fabricated or manipulated the letters or parts of them. SamQuentin: ""Are we to believe that NO DOCUMENTS in this 'treasure trove' have revealed exactly how OBL managed to end up hiding in that Pakistan compound, as well as EXACTLY WHO had been protecting him for all the time he was there?"" Where is the smoking gun, the poster asks. ""Or will that information be 'strategically released' at an 'appropriate moment' to confirm Pakistan's complicity?"" Lt. Col. Liam Collins, director of the Combating Terrorism Center which published the documents, gave an advance quote to CNN prior to the Thursday release of the documents. The CTC published an analysis of the documents. ""As for Pakistan, the discussion in the documents is scarce and therefore inconclusive,"" Collins said. ""There are no explicit references to any institutional Pakistani support for al-Qaeda or its operatives."" Europedude wrote: ""How do we know the documents aren't just another made up lie? They've lied about everything else."" Establisher posted: ""Obama has done well, at least tactically. Pulling out troops before further escalation of deaths, a successful raid or at least a drama that is convincing to many, except the Pakistanis themselves. And now the documents, even if forged, sends a clear message ... we are pulling out and our work is over."" ""People actually trust that these documents are genuine and not manipulated for political means? Really? Revoke their voting cards,"" posted 55reasons. ""This is all such timely horse s****. Obama flies to Afghanistan to tell the US stormtroopers their liberation is near. Suddenly we hear about Osama's remorse for his failures and misdeeds. Give me a break. Those documents in US hands....We are to believe that they are telling us HIS truth. Yeah, right the check is in the mail..."" Finding the humor . Some readers found bin Laden's letters simply amusing, if not downright funny. BBoy705: I just read a bunch of the letters, I had no idea OBL was that us! Boy that guy was on a holy terror! His poetry was awful though... no cadence. Anyway, I guess it really doesn't mater now... he's dead. Phil: LOL these docs are so hilarious. They're all about ""Oh dear Brother, God protect you, Allah loves you, In the name of Peace and God..."" and then ""rip out their eyes and let the blood from their tainted bodies flood the streets"". Puuuuuhlease. MartinOM: Laughed out loud at this comment from the letter from Gadahn about the anniversary of 9/11, speaking about American news channels: ""From the professional point of view, they are all on one level--except Fox News channel which falls into the abyss as you know, and lacks neutrality too."" Tinwatchman wrote that reading bin Laden's letters recalls the everyday writing of Adolf Hitler or the Columbine shooters. ""We tend to mythologize people like Bin Laden -- be it as a hero, a villain, or a monster. In Bin Laden's case, it seems to me that he deliberately tried to build up his own legend. But looking into these letters tends to reinforce just how ridiculously human he really was underneath it all. (What was it they said about Eichmann? ""The banality of evil""?) ""It's easier, in a lot of ways, to pretend that only a monster or a caricature could do the sort of things that Bin Laden did. To know and accept that actual feeling, thinking human beings can commit such acts? That's hard."" Drone strikes strike a chord . The letters reveal that bin Laden was instructing his followers to be careful because U.S. drone strikes were hurting al Qaeda. ""The government needs to step up these drone strikes because from the documents it shows that those drones had Bin Laden all shook up,"" understandingoverignorance wrote. Facepalm28: ""Ten years after 9/11, we still go about our daily lives without constantly worrying about when the next bomb will go off or next attack will come. The men who plotted that attack (those that are still alive) live in constant fear of when our drones or spec-ops teams will find them. THIS is how we should fight the war on terror; THIS is how we will win it."" A poster claiming to be an Army sergeant deployed in Afghanistan wrote: ""Agreed! It would be nice if they could take care of it with the use of Drones alone, but unfortunately we have to be on the ground in many situations, to guide our precise munitions. Too many years over here."" Bin Laden on Biden . Bin Laden's correspondence shows that he instructed his followers to try to kill President Barack Obama but to leave Vice President Joseph Biden alone. Biden is ""unprepared for that post,"" according to one letter. If Obama were killed and Biden took control of the White House, bin Laden wrote, it would ""lead the US into a crisis."" KeninTexas posted about bin Laden: ""Well, I guess he wasn't wrong about everything."" ThisGADude wrote: ""I love how OBL and his like believe the rest of the world is as black and white as theirs is. (If) Obama would have been assassinated, the US pop. would have rallied and united behind Biden and our military in a way that hasn't been seen in the 1940's. We disagree on policy -- there is no lack of nationhood. Stupid Terrorist."" If you have an opinion on the documents, tell us in the comments section.

"(CNN) -- Myanmar has invited the United States and the European Union to send representatives to observe elections in April, according to officials in the region. Surin Pitsuwan, the secretary-general of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, said in a post Wednesday on his official Twitter account that Myanmar's deputy minister for foreign affairs had told him that all members of the association's regional forum were invited to observe the elections. The regional forum is much broader than the association's core membership and includes the United States and the European Union, as well as big Asian democracies such as India and Japan. An official from Myanmar's Information Ministry, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak publicly on the matter, confirmed that the country had offered to let the U.S. and the EU election monitors observe the by-elections due to be held on April 1. International attention is focused on the April elections, which are seen as a test of the Myanmar's government's commitment to lasting political reform. The international community has applauded recent steps toward greater openness in Myanmar, also known as Burma, long secluded from the rest of the world after a military junta grabbed power in 1962. The generals are loosening their grip after international sanctions and criticism over their regime's human rights record. The opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and her party, the National League for Democracy, will participate in the by-elections after boycotting previous votes. Suu Kyi, who was released from years under house arrest in 2010, has been crisscrossing the country to attend election rallies. Earlier this month, state television broadcast an election campaign speech by Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, for the first time. On Tuesday, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations said that Myanmar had invited member states of the organization to each send two legislators and three media representatives to observe the elections. The 10-member association comprises of Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Its goal is to promote economic growth and regional stability. CNN's Jethro Mullen and Kathy Quiano contributed to this report.","April by-elections in Myanmar are seen as a test of recent reforms .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israeli security forces are preparing to deport hundreds of pro-Palestinian activists expected to arrive at the country's main international airport beginning Sunday to protest Israel's policies in the occupied West Bank. ""Israeli Police will be implementing measures inside and around Ben Gurion airport from the weekend in order to deal with the arrival of activists into the country,"" Israeli police spokesman Mickey Rosenfeld told CNN . Activists for ""Welcome to Palestine 2012 "" one of the pro-Palestinian groups organizing what has been dubbed a ""fly-in"" event, said some 1500 to 2000 activists mainly from Europe, the United States, and Canada would board civilian flights for Israel in order to make their way to various events in Bethlehem and other West Bank cities. Organizers say they are trying to draw attention to what they claim are prejudicial Israeli border policies that force many international visitors coming to Palestinian areas to lie about their destinations. ""We believe, like prisoners in prisons, we are entitled to receive visitors and Palestinians under Israeli occupation are also entitled to receive visitors,"" said event coordinator Mazin Qumsiyeh. ""So we are entitled to get international visitors to come and visit and show solidarity with us to learn about the situation, but Israel chooses to prevent these people from coming,"" Last year organizers staged a similar event and Israel authorities detained and deported dozens of activists who entered the country. On Tuesday Israel's public security minister, Yitzhak Aharonovitch called activists ""provocateurs"" and told Israeli news portal Ynet they would ""be dealt with in a determined and quick way,"" adding that ""If they arrive in Israel they will be identified, removed from the plane, their entry into Israel will be prevented and they will be moved to a detention facility until they are flown out of Israel."" To that end Israeli officials have been in touch with airlines and provided them with lists of people who are forbidden from entering the country. ""Usually airlines don't allow these people to embark, because then they have to cover the expense of the return flight"" said Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor. ""What we did last year is we had a list of number of people who have been banned from entering the country in the past, and others who will be banned now because they have openly declared that they will come here to disturb public order in one way or another,"" Palmor told CNN . Palmor said passengers landing who are denied an entrance visa have the right to appeal but could face three days in detention before their hearing. Qumsiyeh insists the event is entirely peaceful in nature and suggested that Israeli authorities were over-reacting. ""The Israeli internal security is paranoid and is turning the airport into a military camp. They want to arrest the activists and are calling us provocateurs and demonstrators as they always do"" Qumsiyeh said. ""The activists are coming peacefully and will visit the West Bank and help us build a community school and then they will go home with no problems, Israel is creating the problems and not us.""","1500 to 2000 activists expected by air from Europe, U.S., Canada, says activist group .

"(CNN) -- Valencia led a trio of Spanish clubs into the semifinals of the Europa League with a 4-0 thrashing of AZ Alkmaar Thursday. Trailing 2-1 from the first leg in the Netherlands, the La Liga side took just 15 minutes at their Mestalla Stadium to draw level on aggregate as Adil Rami scored. He quickly added a second before Jordi Alba made it three on 56 minutes. Pablo Hernandez completed the rout in the 80th minute for the two-time Champions League finalists. Valencia, who won the 2004 UEFA Cup under Rafael Benitez, will face fellow Spanish club Atletico Madrid in the last four. 2010 winners Atletico won 2-1 at Bundesliga Hanover to go through 4-2 on aggregate. Leading 2-1 from the first leg in the Spanish capital, Atletico went further ahead in the tie as Adrian Lopez scored a fine individual goal. Mame Diouf gave Hanover some late hope with an equalizer on 81 minutes but Radamel Falcao scored the clinching goal for Atletico in the closing moments. Athletic Bilboa, such impressive winners over English Premier League leaders Manchester United in the quarterfinals, were held 2-2 by Schalke on their home ground, but the Basque side went through 6-4 on aggregate.

"(CNN) -- A co-founder of the National Necrotizing Fasciitis Foundation said Thursday that she felt sorry for the young woman diagnosed with rare ""flesh-eating"" bacterial infection when she heard about her this week in media reports. ""First thing I thought when I saw the news was, 'Oh, how tragic, another case!'"" said Jacqueline Roemmele in a telephone interview about the first report of Aimee Copeland, a 24-year-old graduate student at West Georgia University who had lost a leg and was expected to lose her fingers to the infection. Though there is uncertainty about just how common such infections are since no clearinghouse compiles statistics on their incidence, Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of the Department of Preventive Medicine at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, estimates there are fewer than 250 cases every year in the United States. The reporting of such cases is not required by law. Flesh-eating bacteria explained . ""I get e-mails about these cases every single day,"" said Roemmele, who noted that news coverage of such cases is far rarer than the infections themselves are. ""If you look at our foundation and our Facebook page, there's discussion constantly among thousands of people, but it just isn't sexy for the media."" Still, this week's TV and print pieces about Copeland did not surprise Roemmele. ""It was a cute girl that everyone can relate to,"" she said. In addition, Copeland's relatives have made themselves available to reporters and her classmates have been vocal in their support. Copeland 'in high spirits,' father says . ""Every three or four years or so it happens, where a case will take off in the media,"" said Roemmele, who is based in northern New Jersey. But Roemmele said she was grateful for the coverage, whatever the motivation. Not only has her foundation received a ""substantial"" increase in donations since the cases went public, but the stories may have some educational value. If people seek quicker treatment next time they get a cut that results in a rapidly spreading infection, causes pain disproportionate to the size of the cut and is associated with flulike symptoms, then the goals of her group will be furthered, she said. Group A streptoccal bacteria, the same bacteria that cause strep throat, are the main culprits, although -- as occurred in Copeland's case -- other bacteria can also result in the disease, known to doctors as necrotizing fasciitis, Roemmele said. ""You're fine when you go to bed at night, but you wake up in the morning with your leg twice the size and turning black and you have a 105 or above fever,"" she said. ""I've known many, many cases where people have died within 24 hours."" Roemmele herself survived the infection. ""Eighteen years ago, I had a surgery on my abdomen after a C-section for my twins,"" she said. ""By the time they finally found out what was wrong with me, my flesh was falling off in the nurse's hands."" South Carolina woman 'very ill, but stable' After recovering, she and a fellow survivor founded the website. In the 12 years since, tens of thousands of people have told their stories on the site about the disease, she said. ""I'm happy to see that it's again getting some attention,"" she said. ""The biggest problem we have is missed diagnosis. That's huge. So, if somebody goes into the ER, invariably they're turned away. By the time they go back, they've reached the advanced stages of the disease and they're either losing limbs or losing their lives."" That comes close to describing what happened to Dan Coogan. In 1995, the 41-year-old triathlete was gardening in his yard outside Dallas. As he set about transplanting a tree, he lifted its 2-inch trunk, which was attached to a 2-foot-wide root ball. ""One of the roots poked me in my calf, and I didn't even know it,"" he said. ""Within an hour, I felt like I had a Charlie horse. By the end of the day, I was vomiting all the time. I felt like I had the flu. I had a fever. I went to bed sicker than a dog."" A few hours later, at 4 a.m., his house was struck by lightning and caught fire. As firefighters arrived and extinguished it, ""I could barely walk around because of the pain in my leg,"" he said. He went back to bed, in worsening pain. ""I just started popping a lot more painkillers."" At 10 a.m., with his cut growing fiery, he went to a small regional hospital in nearby Lewisville. ""They checked me in and didn't do anything for two days"" except administer antibiotics, he said. By then, ""this thing had taken over the backside of my leg and was more than halfway up my thigh."" His luck turned when a friend, who happened to be a surgeon, recognized that something was awry and arranged for his transfer to another hospital, where doctors immediately recognized the symptoms. ""Within an hour of checking into that hospital, I was in surgery,"" he said. Each night for nearly two weeks, he underwent operations that included removal of the infected tissue and dead flesh. ""They told me every night for nine nights that they were going to take my leg off,"" he said. But one of the doctors put it off, saying ""I'm going to take a chance here,"" he recalled. ""She was right, thank goodness. I made it through all the surgeries and debridement (tissue removal) and living on morphine for 2Â½ weeks ... I was able to survive the whole thing and I walked out of the hospital."" But his case, like most of the others he had learned about, generated no interest from the news media. ""The people who get it aren't 24 and grad students,"" he said, referring to Copeland. ""And she's got a community of other students. ... The press has kinda glamorized this one.""","""Oh, how tragic, another case!"" says co-founder of the National Necrotizing Fasciitis Foundation .

"(CNN) -- Emergency officials report at least 27 people in nine states have died as a result of Hurricane Irene. North Carolina -- 6 . Pennsylvania -- 5 . Virginia -- 4 . New York -- 3 . Vermont -- 3 . Connecticut -- 2 . New Jersey -- 2 . Maryland -- 1 . Florida -- 1 . Authorities are trying to determine whether an additional death reported in New York is connected to the storm. Here is a state-by-state breakdown: . New York . -- A 50-year-old man was electrocuted Sunday while trying to aid a father and son who came in contact with a downed power line on a flooded street in Spring Valley in southern New York, police there said. -- The body of woman who apparently drowned after she either fell or was swept into a storm-swollen creek was recovered Sunday near New Scotland, New York State Police said. -- One man in Croton, New York, died Sunday while boating along with four others down the Croton River, said Lt. Russell Haper, a spokesman for the Croton police. The boat overturned in the strong rapids. The 53-year-old man was found dead after a three-hour rescue effort. The other men were pulled safely from the water. -- Authorities are trying to determine whether the drowning death of a windsurfer whose body was discovered Sunday in New York's Bellport Bay is related to Irene, Suffolk County Police said. This death is not included in the fatality count until the determination is complete. Pennsylvania . -- One person was killed in an overnight traffic accident in Carbon County, said Ruth Miller, a spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency. -- In separate incidents, a man in a camper and a man in a tent were crushed when trees fell on them, Miller said. -- A 64-year-old woman was found dead Sunday by Whitemarsh, Pennsylvania, police after her family grew concerned when she did not show up for work. Her body was found a half-mile from where her car was abandoned in a deluged creek, police said. -- Miller did not immediately have details on the fifth death, but said it was a storm-related fatality. Connecticut . -- Gov. Dan Malloy told reporters that state police were reporting an apparent storm-related fatality ""related to downed wires."" -- A man in Bristol, Connecticut, was killed Sunday when the canoe he and another man were riding in failed to clear a bridge on the Pequabuck River and flipped, Bristol Police Department spokesman Edward Spyros said. The man's death appeared to be an accidental drowning. The other man surfaced alive. Florida . -- Witnesses spotted a 55-year-old surfer face down in the water Saturday off New Smyrna Beach, Florida, said Capt. Tamara Marris, a spokeswoman for the Volusia County Beach Patrol. He was nonresponsive and had a large cut on his head when emergency personnel examined him. Marris said the death was connected to the storm because ""the surf that we had this morning was a remnant of Hurricane Irene."" Maryland . -- A woman in Queenstown, Maryland, died Saturday night after a large tree knocked a chimney through the roof of her home, crushing her, according to Kevin Aftung, the chief of emergency Services for Queen Anne's County. New Jersey . -- A woman was killed when floodwater swept away her car, Gov. Chris Christie said Sunday. Christie had said earlier that a firefighter was killed while attempting a water rescue, but later said he was given ""bad information."" The firefighter remains in intensive care. -- A 47-year-old Orange, New Jersey, man died after leaving his submerged car to wade through floodwater to reach the post office where he worked, Kearny police said. The man's co-workers said that shortly before the entrance to the building, the man stepped into a concealed drainage creek and disappeared. Despite a two-hour rescue effort and an attempt by one of his co-workers to save him, the man's body was found about 100 yards from his car.

"(CNN) -- In Hollywood movies, they're often portrayed as danger-dodging men with dark glasses, smoothly working behind the scenes to protect the president at any cost. But a group of Secret Service members drew worldwide attention over the weekend for a different reason -- accusations of misconduct involving prostitutes. The incident -- which allegedly occurred when agents and officers brought prostitutes to a hotel in Colombia -- violates strict behavior rules in an agency that aims to stay out of the spotlight, and usually succeeds, experts and officials said. ""The main problem here for the Secret Service agents is not so much a criminal violation, but really it is a dereliction of duty, not doing their job,"" said U.S. Rep. Peter King, who chairs the House Homeland Security Committee. Security clearances yanked . While soliciting prostitution is legal in some parts of Colombia, it's a breach of the agency's conduct code, U.S. government sources said. High-level officials in the Secret Service and the Department of Homeland Security were outraged over the incident, the sources said, noting that the investigation indicated the prostitutes were brought to a hotel that had been secured for the Summit of the Americas. But officials and analysts disagreed about how great a threat the alleged misconduct posed -- and how common it could be. ""This is really the biggest scandal in the history of the Secret Service,"" said Ron Kessler, a former Washington Post reporter who has written a book about the agency. Dan Emmett, a former Secret Service agent, said such allegations have never surfaced before, arguing that this is ""a very isolated type of incident."" ""The president, since the beginning of the presidential protective division (of the Secret Service) in 1902, has been on hundreds and hundreds of overseas trips. Now, this is the first time anything like this has come up. ... In my 21-year career, this was certainly not the norm, and I think this is certainly out of the ordinary,"" Emmett said. President demands 'rigorous' investigation . Authorities have released few details about the allegations. There was a dispute over payment between at least one Secret Service member and a woman brought to his hotel, U.S. government sources familiar with the investigation have said. At least one of the women brought to the hotel talked with police, and complaints were filed with the U.S. Embassy, the sources said. U.S. government sources said the agents and officers under investigation were not part of the president's personal protective detail, and stressed that there was no threat to the president. Such details indicate that the Secret Service agents allegedly involved would not have been ""in close proximity to the president,"" Emmett said. ""A presidential advance team that goes overseas is literally a cast of hundreds,"" he said. ""You have the people who are going to be doing the various sites, the motorcade routes and so on. Most of these people are not in direct access to the president."" Emmett dismissed speculation that the Secret Service agents and officers allegedly involved could have been easy targets for blackmail. ""In the world of espionage and foreign intelligence services, anything is possible. However, I just don't see it in this case,"" he said. ""These particular individuals, I don't believe they would have been targeted. ... They just simply don't have the information that would be valuable."" But King, who was briefed on the investigation, said there were still security concerns. ""Their job is to protect the president of the United States. They can't put themselves in a compromising position where they could be blackmailed or threatened,"" he said. ""Nor should they bring prostitutes into a security zone 48 hours before the president of the United States is arriving."" Lawmakers say they're troubled by scandal . Kessler, who first broke the story to the Washington Post but did not reveal his sources, said some of the Secret Service agents involved are married and could have been easy blackmail targets. ""As a result, they could have let terrorists into secure areas and that could have resulted in assassination,"" he said. U.S. Rep. Darrell Issa told CBS's ""Face the Nation"" that he wasn't satisfied with repeated reassurances that the president wasn't in danger. ""The investigation ... will be about how did this happen and how often has this happened before. Things like this don't happen once if they didn't happen before,"" said the California congressman, who chairs the House Oversight Committee. Secret Service members sent home after incident . The investigation into the allegations has stretched beyond the Secret Service. The U.S. military has said five U.S. troops who were working with the Secret Service are under investigation for missing curfew and alleged misconduct at the Colombian hotel where Secret Service agents are said to have brought prostitutes. On Monday, Pentagon spokesman George Little said the number of troops involved ""may be more than five."" Speaking to reporters in Colombia Sunday, U.S. President Barack Obama said he would wait for the investigation's results before passing judgment. ""I expect that investigation to be thorough and I expect it to be rigorous. If it turns out that some of the allegations that have been made in the press are confirmed, then of course I'll be angry,"" he said. CNN's Randi Kaye, John King, Soledad O'Brien and Dan Lothian contributed to this report.","Secret Service members are accused of bringing prostitutes to a secure hotel .

"(CNN) -- When Afghan forces repelled a barrage of attacks from insurgents near Kabul's green zone over the weekend it was hailed as proof of how far local security forces had come. ""They were on scene immediately, well-led and well-coordinated,"" said General John Allen, the U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan. Afghan president Hamid Karzai said it showed the country's forces would be able to defend their country after international forces leave. Karzai: Afghan forces ready to defend nation . Then on Tuesday, Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard announced her country would pull its troops out months earlier expected -- by early 2014 -- citing an improvement in the security situation. ""We continue to see steady gains in the fight against the Afghan insurgency,"" Gillard said, in a speech in Canberra. Australia plans Afghan exit . Australia's 1,550 troops in Afghanistan are a fraction of the overall number of foreign troops deployed to keep a lid on the country's insurgency more than ten years after allied airstrikes marked the start of Operation Enduring Freedom. How many international troops are operating in Afghanistan? More than 130,000 troops from 50 countries are currently operating in Afghanistan, according to the International Security and Assistance Force (ISAF). The United States is the biggest contributor, providing around 90,000 troops, followed by the United Kingdom (9,500), Germany (4,800) and France (3,600). The international force has been there since 2001, shortly after the al Qaeda attacks on the U.S. on September 11. The campaign was launched to stop the Taliban from providing a safe haven for al Qaeda fighters, and to stop the terror group's use of Afghanistan as a base for its future activities. How long are they there for? In June 2011, U.S. President Barack Obama announced that U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan would end by 2014. At that time there were more than 100,000 U.S. troops in the country, following a 30,000-strong troop ""surge"" in December 2009 to help bolster the campaign against the Taliban. In February this year, U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta announced the U.S. hoped to end its combat mission in Afghanistan in 2013, transitioning primarily to a training role as Afghan forces take more responsibility for security. Panetta: Polls won't change Afghan strategy . Some countries have already pulled out of the country. Canada, which once headed the ISAF mission, pulled out almost all of its 3,000 soldiers at the end of 2011. Norway also withdrew almost all of its 500 troops during this period. France announced in February that it would begin an early draw down, and that all 4,000 of its troops would be gone by 2013. Germany plans to pull out some troops next year, with the remainder leaving in 2014. Britain, the second-biggest contributor of troops, plans to hand over its security operations to local forces by the end of 2013, before continuing in a ""supporting role"" from 2014. How well trained are Afghan security forces? The Afghan forces who fought off an 18-hour multi-pronged Taliban attack in Kabul earlier this week are some of the best trained in the country, according to analysts. The crisis response group is based in the capital and has received training from U.S. special forces. Afghan forces repel attacks . ""That would be the equal of any other unit of its type in the region,"" said James Brown, a military associate at the Lowy Institute in Sydney. ""It's got it own intelligence assets, which it didn't have three years ago. They've got their own Afghan aviation assets, helicopters, that can respond to these kind of events. So yes, they are getting better at responding to high-profile events in Kabul -- but the Taliban are getting better as well."" This latter point is picked up by other analysts. ""I think there has to be a real question mark over the long-term prospects for Afghanistan,"" said Andrew Davies, of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. ""I think there are some reasons to be cautiously optimistic over the ability of Afghan forces. But ultimately the future of Afghanistan will be determined by the factions inside Afghanistan. I think if the last 10 years has shown us anything, then the ability of the outside world to influence the future of Afghanistan in the long term is fairly minimal."" What's next? Gillard's announcement of Australia's troop draw down precedes an announcement from President Karzai at a summit on Afghanistan in Chicago in May. The Afghan leader is expected to announce that a third tranche of provinces will be handed back to full Afghan control, including Uruzgan, where most of the Australian troops are based. A clearer split of financial contributions may also emerge at the summit, with the annual cost of funding the Afghan security forces after 2014 estimated to be $4.1 billion. ""The U.S. will probably pay a big part of that and I think the UK will also chip in,"" said Brown. ""You may not see much from the Europeans. But there might be some funding commitments from Japan,"" he added.","Australia's 1,550 troops in Afghanistan a fraction of the overall number of foreign troops deployed .

"(CNN) -- The world of sport has paid its tributes to Livorno midfielder Piermario Morosini, who died Saturday after collapsing on the pitch during his side's Serie B game at Pescara. The entire Italian football program this weekend was canceled and a minute's silence was observed at major league games around the world in his honor. A similar tribute was also paid before the start of Sunday's Milan marathon. Tennis player Sara Errani dedicated her victory in the Barcelona Open final to Morosini. ""This tournament is for him,"" Errani told the WTA official website. ""It has been very hard. The images have impacted me a lot. It's amazing that these things can happen. It really makes you think."" Thousands of fans have gathered outside Livorno's Armando Picchi stadium to pay their respects, leaving flowers and scarves. ""You fought until the end, goodbye great Moro,"" read a banner outside the stadium. Morosini dies after collapsing in Serie B game . ""The family, the girlfriend of Piermario and AS Livorno Calcio wants to thank all of the people that in this time of pain have remembered a great athlete and a special person,"" read a statement on the club's official website. The two main Italian sports papers La Gazzetta dello Sport and Corriere dello Sport had the same headline in their Sunday editions. ""Death on the pitch, football stops."" Udinese, who had loaned out Morosini to the second-flight club, pledged to help Morosini's disabled sister. ""We are profoundly in pain for the premature death of Piermario Morosini,"" read a statement on the club's official website. ""Through our non-profit organisation, 'Udinese for life', we will guarantee assistance to the sister of the unfortunate player, who has now been left on her own. "" The 25-year-old Morosini has been at Udinese since 2005, being loaned out to Bologna, then Reggina, Padova, Vicenza and finally Livorno. He made 18 appearances for Italy's under-21s. But his family life had been blighted by tragedy and he lost both his parents before his 18th birthday. His disabled brother later committed suicide to leave him alone with his handicapped elder sister. Pescara's authorities have announced that they will launch an inquiry into Morosini's death. It has emerged that a parked car belonging to traffic police had initially blocked the ambulance's path into the stadium.","Tributes to Italian footballer Piermario Morosini .

"(CNN) -- The family of New York bus monitor Karen Klein -- who has gained sympathy worldwide after a video of seventh-graders brutally taunting her while on the job went viral this week -- is asking for the harassment of the children to stop. ""Between all of us, we don't feel that's right by any means,"" Klein's daughter, Amanda Romig, told CNN on Friday. ""We would like people to stop harassing the family and the kids. That's another form of bullying."" The video recorded by a fellow student sparked a storm of criticism against the boys, who attend middle school in the Rochester suburb of Greece. The father of 13-year-old Wesley, one of the four boys involved in the incident, told CNN his son is ""pretty depressed"" and ""somewhat in shock"" by the level of attention the video has received and the vitriol directed at the students. ""I think the lesson's learned,"" he told Anderson Cooper. ""This whole thing that we've been through is going to scar our family for life. This is life-changing. ... I don't see this ever happening again."" The family has received ""numerous death threats,"" the father said, as well as people coming to their house and banging on the door after their phone number and address were posted on the Internet. ""It's gotten to the point where we don't want to leave the house,"" he said, describing the atmosphere as ""very tense."" Greece police Capt. Steve Chatterton also called for the harassment to stop, even while acknowledging that police, too, ""felt everyone's pain"" in watching the video. ""There's not going to be a whole lot of remorse for the children,"" he said Thursday. ""And people aren't going to feel real sorry for them. But they've received death threats. We've received 911 calls to their home saying someone was holding them hostage. That's not funny, that's a crime, that's a form of bullying."" Meanwhile, Klein continues to adjust to the attention and emotions spurred by the video's posting. Supporters worldwide have donated more than $575,000 online so far through the international crowd-funding site, Indiegogo.com. The site launched the effort to send Klein on vacation after the video surfaced. And Southwest Airlines announced this week that it would send her and nine others on an all-expense-paid trip to Disneyland. Klein told CNN she's thinking about quitting her job and doing volunteer work after some supporters suggested the donations were enough for retirement. ""I thought, 'That's not a bad idea!' "" she said. She's also weighing donating some of the money to organizations benefiting autism and Down syndrome causes, said Romig, her daughter. Klein wants to raise awareness because of family members with autism and Down syndrome, who might also be victims of bullying, Romig said. As for her own bullies, Wesley's father visited her on Thursday to express his apologies and his mother wrote a note ""to say how sorry she was and how sick it made her to see that her son was involved in this,"" according to Romig. ""I think he was sincere,"" Klein said of the father's visit, but expressed doubt over the apologies she's gotten so far from some of the boys. ""I don't really think they're sorry. Sorry they got caught, yes, that would be more like it."" Klein said one boy wanted to come to her home to speak with her, ""But I said no, because I wasn't ready to look at his face."" But she added that may change after she's able to get away on the trip provided by Southwest: She's taking her two daughters and six grandchildren to Disneyland.

"(CNN) -- American tennis star Serena Williams is hoping to keep up her blistering momentum after a landmark victory at the Family Circle Cup in Charleston --- the 40th WTA Tour title of her illustrious career. Williams thrashed ninth-seeded Czech Lucie Safarova 6-0 6-1 in Sunday's final, and insisted she'd never played so consistently at such a high level in a career that has brought the 30-year-old 13 grand slam singles titles. ""I hope I can make it three and four and five and six and more and more and more,"" the former world No. 1 said on the WTA website after returning to the top 10 of the women's rankings. ""I definitely want to continue this. I've never played so consistently at such a high level with low errors like this, and the scary thing is I could have served so much better."" Williams took just 58 minutes to defeat Safarova, hitting 27 winners to eight as she topped off an impressive performance at the opening event of the tour's clay-court season. She lost just 15 games all week in South Carolina, crushing world No. 5 Samantha Stosur 6-1 6-1 in Saturday's semifinals to avenge the Australian's win over her older sister Venus in the previous round. It was the first time this year she has got past the quarterfinals of a tournament. Serena is just the third player still on the WTA circuit to notch up 40 titles, alongside Venus (43) and Belgium's former world No. 1 Kim Clijsters (41). It was her second success at Charleston, following a 2008 triumph, and fourth on clay after winning both the French Open and the Italian Open in 2002. However, following more than a year on the sidelines after winning the 2010 Wimbledon title, she now has no substantial ranking points to defend until July. ""In June, Wimbledon, I didn't do anything. Eastbourne I won one match, so that doesn't count. I did pretty well in the summer, but then I dropped off again until this tournament. So I really am like a floating bird,"" the ninth-ranked Williams said. ""It's motivating for me to go home and work harder, because I know Lucie and Sam and everyone is going to work hard, too. Now they know what to expect even more when they play me. This is a battle, and I want to continue to win."" Safarova didn't leave Charleston empty-handed, however, securing her first WTA doubles title alongside Russia's Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova as they beat Spaniards Anabel Medina Garrigues and Yaroslava Shvedova 5-7 6-4 10-6. ""Nastia and I got our first wildcard in Miami and made the quarters, and here we got our second wildcard and won it. I like doubles. I really enjoy playing doubles and it seems we fit as partners,"" Safarova said.","Family Circle Cup champion Serena Williams hopes to continue winning momentum .

"(CNN) -- Top seed Caroline Wozniacki wasted little time in booking her passage into the quarterfinals of the WTA tournament in Copenhagen Thursday. The Danish favorite beat Pauline Parmentier 6-2 6-1 in second round action as she bids for a third straight title in her home tournament. Sixth-ranked Wozniacki was tested in her opener against Poland's Urszula Radwanska but was back to her ruthless best against Parmentier of France. ""I got more used to the surface compared to the last match and that was definitely a difference,"" Wozniacki told the official WTA website. ""It was a very different match compared to the last one.""

"(CNN) -- Three-time league MVP LeBron James finally has an NBA championship to add to his belt, after the Miami Heat defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder 121-106 in game five of the 2012 NBA Finals. The forward, whose search for a championship ring sent him to the Heat from his hometown Cleveland Cavaliers two seasons ago, played a huge role in Thursday's win with 26 points, 11 rebounds and 13 assists. A triple-double, as well as strong performances in each of the previous games earned James the coveted title of Most Valuable Player (MVP). ""It's about damn time,"" James told NBA.com upon receiving the award, which was handed to him by NBA legend Bill Russell. ""It's everything and more. I dreamed about this moment for a long time. Including last night, including today,"" James told media following the game, as carried by NBA.com. ""My dream has become a reality now and this is probably the best feeling I've ever had."" The Heat, who won four games straight to win the best-of-seven series, took a lead early in the game and never let up. James and his teammates led by 25 points in the final minutes of the third quarter. Guard Dwyane Wade, who won his first NBA championship with the Heat in 2006, added 20 points in Thursday's victory. ""We had to go through last year,"" Wade said of the team's loss in last year's NBA Finals. ""As much as it hurt, we had to experience it to get here, this season.""

"(CNN) -- We all know this election is going to be about the economy. President Barack Obama knows it, Mitt Romney knows it and so do the media -- even though at times pundits pretend it's about much smaller and sillier topics. The difference, as the president told the country last week, is that he is the only candidate in the race who truly understands that it's about a very specific part of our economy: the middle class. Obama's plan is to grow the economy from the middle out, using common-sense measures that help small businesses, invest in clean-energy technology and train a new generation of skilled workers. Romney's plan is to return to the same failed, trickle-down policies -- but made worse by the tea party politics of slash-and-burn against government -- that threaten hardworking middle-class families. Those are two very different visions. Where do they come from? Both candidates have looked at the same history but derive very different lessons. Obama studied how the middle class was built -- sending students and veterans to school, developing a strong manufacturing base and making sure our laboratories of innovation are built on American soil and grit. That foundation created a great American middle class that became the envy of the world. In the Clinton-Gore years, private-sector businesses created 23 million new jobs. The president is determined to rebuild the foundation that led to such historic success. Romney, on the other hand, has fixated on the failed ideas of the last decade. He endorsed eliminating the rules that protect our workers and keep corporations from gambling away our money. He was all for giving the wealthy a permanent break on taxes -- and wants to increase the nation's debt by having us pay for more tax havens for the rich. Romney wants to return to policies that funneled wealth upward and pushed the middle class down -- and almost out. Like the Obama campaign says about Romney's broken promises in Massachusetts: It didn't work then, and it won't work now. You don't have to take my word for it. Independent economists have said Romney's warmed-over ideas would pull us back toward recession at the very time we need to keep pushing toward a full recovery. Obama's correct reading of history is why he's made the decisions he has in his first term -- even when they were politically unpopular. When the auto industry started to collapse and factories began shutting their doors, Obama knew that, as a country, we needed to rescue it. Now American car companies and American manufacturers are surging, opening new factories and hiring new workers. Romney has been forthright: He would have let the companies go into bankruptcy in a process experts said would have shuttered the factories and led the workers to lose their jobs. Obama also found a housing market in which thousands of Americans were going into foreclosure. He fought to keep people in their homes despite being obstructed at every turn by Republicans in Congress who tried to make it impossible for struggling homeowners to refinance or renegotiate their mortgages. Romney, of course, has no plan to help underwater homeowners. We've got a long way to go, but the president's policies have stopped the bleeding of jobs. Since June 2009, when the stimulus took effect, the private sector has been adding jobs -- and if not for Republican obstruction of recovery efforts, there would have been a dramatically greater increase in employment. And despite all his talk of business expertise, Romney ranked 47th out of 50 in job creation when he was governor of Massachusetts. This is a choice between two courses of action, but it is also a choice between two different visions. Obama was buoyed up on a groundswell of small donors, young and old, rich and poor -- people who wished to see a country restored and an economy rebuilt. Romney was chosen by the same class of the Republican elite who met in the early days of January 2009 and vowed to block Obama at every turn. While the president promised to make his top priority the success of the middle class, Republicans declared the president's failure their No. 1 objective. Read Bobby Jindal's view: Obama's message of divide and blame . Obama has kept faith with the middle class and kept his focus on moving forward. He has pushed for a just budget and a fair tax code to relieve our deficit. He will encourage companies to bring their jobs and profits back to our shores, hire new workers, invest in research and technology, rebuild our roads and bridges, and invest in promising new sources of energy. His vision is based on action, while Romney's is based on inaction: ""Let Detroit go bankrupt,"" let foreclosures ""hit the bottom,"" and wait, wait, wait for wealth to trickle down -- which it has never done and will never do for the middle class. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Donna Brazile.","Donna Brazile: President Barack Obama truly understands how to build up the middle class .

"(CNN) -- Serena Williams is looking forward to the new clay season after scoring her first win on the surface in almost two years. The fifth seed is hoping her decisive win over Russia's Elena Vesnina at the season's clay court opener in Charleston will help her build up to the French Open starting late May. Williams last played on clay at Roland Garros in 2010. But that didn't stop her defeating Vesnina 6-3 6-4 on Tuesday. The American fired 11 aces and broke serve three times against the U.S. event's 2011 finalist Vesnina. The win takes her through to the third round of the WTA's Family Circle Cup, where she he will next face either New Zealander Marina Erakovic or Georgian Anna Tatishvili. The last time Williams played at Charleston was in 2008, when she won the title. ""I really love the clay,"" Williams said on the WTA website. ""I feel like it suits my game. I don't have to go crazy and move my feet so much. And it's no different from hard or grass -- I should be able to play the same and do the same, if not better, because I have more time."" Williams' 11th ace came at the most critical time -- match point. The former world number one, who is back in the top 10 after making the quarterfinals in Miami last week, admitted she managed to beat Vesnina despite eating too much before the match. ""Unfortunately I had some banana pudding before I went out. I don't know why I did that. It was so good though,"" she said. ""I keep tweeting how I'm having so much trouble with the food. That's actually my Achilles heel, soul food and southern food. Maybe that's why it's been four years since I've been here."" Her sister Venus also made her clay return earlier on Tuesday, defeating the Czech Republic's Iveta Benesova 6-4, 6-3. Venus, who won the tournament in 2004, is currently 87th in the world after a long absence due to illness. She made hard work of dispatching Benesova in little under one-and-a-half hours.

"Huntington Beach, California (CNN) -- It's dark. Sunrise is still more than an hour away as Janet Evans tucks a last strand of dark hair beneath her latex swim cap. ""This is the hardest part,"" she says as she stares into the blue light reflected up out of the pool and prepares to plunge into another day of exhausting training. By day's end, Evans will have logged up to 10 miles in the pool and 45 minutes of intense training in the weight room. Her goal seems an impossible dream, an Olympic comeback after 15 years in retirement. She will compete in U.S. Olympic Trials in the 800-meter freestyle next week. As her slender body knifes through the water, it is easy to imagine that the clock has rolled back to 1988, when Evans burst onto the Olympic scene at 17 with three gold medal victories at Seoul, South Korea. Four years later, Evans added silver and another gold at the games in Barcelona. In 1996, she was a part of one of the most electrifying moments in Olympic history, when she passed the Olympic flame to Muhammad Ali in Atlanta's Opening Ceremonies. But by the '96 Olympics, Evans was burned out from over a decade of competition. ""I was 24,"" she says, ""I'd started to have a few shoulder problems. ... I was tired, you know?"" At 40, Evans still retains the effervescent smile that warmed the nation's heart so long ago. Gone is the pixie haircut. It's been replaced with a more sophisticated shoulder-length style more fitting a busy post-retirement career as a wife, a mother of two, an Olympics booster and a motivational speaker. She is currently representing Metamucil. Evans says those experiences, especially motherhood, have given her a more grounded perspective than she ever had at 17. It was two years ago that Evans started thinking about a comeback. She was attending a swim meet and realized that the winning times hadn't really improved much in the 15 years since her retirement. ""Can I do this?"" she texted her former coach, Mark Schubert. ""You'll never know unless you try,"" was his response. But Schubert warned that the distance races that were Evans' specialty can take a toll on a 40-year-old body. Evans says she was back in the water the next day, the start of a two-year odyssey. She swims six days a week now with members of the Golden West Swim Club, a team made up of kids less than half her age. ""Those teenagers are an important part of my life,"" says Evans, ""They motivate me."" But will that motivation be enough to return Evans to the top of her sport? Schubert says it just might. ""Her attitude is exactly the same as it was when she was younger,"" Schubert said. ""I think Janet is going to amaze everyone with how fast she can swim."" Since announcing her comeback, Evans has heard from both supporters and critics. "" 'You've had your time.' I've heard that a lot,"" says Evans. ""For me, it's a question of confidence and knowing that my legacy will be intact. (It's) being proud of the fact that at 40, I can come back and actually swim with 17-year-olds and keep up."" ""Well, if I swim fast enough,"" laughs Evans, ""Who says it's not my time?""","Janet Evans, 40, is trying to make the U.S. Olympic swimming team .

"(CNN) -- On Tuesday, 47 Republican senators voted against a measure that would have allowed the Paycheck Fairness Act to go to a vote in the Senate. Why not let the bill go to a full vote? The Republican Party didn't want to confront the fact that by opposing the Paycheck Fairness Act, it stands against the interests of hard-working women across the country. The Paycheck Fairness Act shouldn't be a partisan issue, and few stories make this clearer than that of my client Terri Kelly. Kelly, a married mother of three boys in Memphis, was born and raised in Mayfield, Kentucky. Her parents live in the same home in which she was raised, and her brother is the pastor of the church she attended as a child. By her own description, she typically finds her opinions aligning most closely with the Republican Party. Nonetheless, Kelly traveled to Washington last week to testify before Congress in support of the Paycheck Fairness Act. At the hearing, Kelly explained that she discovered the pay discrimination only because her husband happened to work the same job for the same company at the same time. Month after month, his paychecks were consistently higher. Over the nine years they both worked at the company, Kelly's husband made about $65,000 more. Performance wasn't to blame; Kelly and her husband were both excellent performers, with Kelly outranking him significantly in his last few years. A lack of drive or commitment wasn't to blame; Kelly frequently won regional and national awards. Although my firm was able to prove that Kelly -- along with a class of thousands of other women -- were underpaid in a discriminatory way, winning that case took almost seven years, with more than 60 lawyers and staff working about 37,000 hours and spending more than $2 million in out-of-pocket expenses. At the trial, Kelly was the only witness able to provide direct knowledge of pay discrimination; none of the other victims had been lucky enough to see another man's paycheck for the same job. As Kelly testified, ""We can't hope that the stars align and that those lucky moments fall in place for every woman in America."" Instead, the Paycheck Fairness Act puts more of the power back into the hands of employees by making it easier for employees to share information about what they are being paid and to fight unfair pay practices together. Without it, women will continue to work in environments where they hope -- but don't know -- that they are being paid fairly. The women I represent frequently are unsure whether they are being underpaid; there may be hints but little proof before it's fully discovered in expensive and public litigation. The lack of transparency and accountability surrounding compensation continually confounds working women. One client went so far as to brag she made as much or more than the men in her department based on her salary negotiations. While her base salary was strong, what she didn't know was that her employer paid men so much more in routine ""bonuses"" that her net compensation was thousands less each year. In another case, a witness for a defendant learned that -- even as she testified the company was a good place for women to work -- that same employer was intentionally underpaying her. We discovered these facts only because of documents produced to us by the employers as a part of litigation. No matter how good you are at your job, how sure you may be that you've negotiated a fair compensation package, or how much you believe in your employer, if you are a woman, it is possible that you are being seriously underpaid. And systemic underpayment of women hurts us all. If women were paid fairly, poverty rates could fall by more than half, and the country's GDP could increase by as much as 9%. No company should fear the truth about their own pay practices if they are doing the right thing, and the Republican Party should not protect corporate profit margins at the expense of American families. If working women and men across this country want to see fairness returned to the American workplace, they should reach out to their elected officials and put pressure on them to support the Paycheck Fairness Act. If that doesn't work, they should elect candidates who will. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kate Kimpel.","Kate Kimpel: GOP senators stopped Paycheck Fairness Act, a blow for working women .

"(CNN) -- Four of Paraguay's neighbors said Sunday they are pulling their ambassadors from the country in the wake of the impeachment of Paraguay's president. Chile and Venezuela recalled the ambassadors hours after Brazil and Uruguay -- two of Paraguay's most important neighbors -- did the same. Argentina recalled its ambassador on Saturday. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez also said his country is halting all shipments to Paraguay. Brazil's foreign ministry said the action was due to the ""breakdown of democracy"" in Paraguay, and vowed to take up the impeachment with the regional blocs MERCOSUR and UNASUR. The moves follow the lightning-quick removal from office of President Fernando Lugo on Friday. The impeachment procedures appear to have been carried out in accordance with the Paraguayan constitution, but some Latin American presidents call it a coup d'etat and refuse to recognize the new president, Federico Franco. Lugo went from president to disgraced leader in less than 48 hours. The former Catholic bishop was unpopular with lawmakers, and many had concerns about his credibility after he he admitted to fathering at least two children while still in the priesthood. In all, four women claim they had babies by Lugo while he was bishop. But nine days ago, there was no reason to believe that Lugo would find himself out of a job before his term ended in August 2013. Then Paraguay impeached its president so fast that its neighbors needed a few days to figure out how to react. By Sunday, Brazil and Uruguay were expressing deep concerns. Brazil's foreign ministry condemned the president's removal and Uruguay's president said it wasn't in line with democratic practices. Paraguay swears in new leader after impeachment . There had been calls in the past for the impeachment of Lugo, but the scandals did not rock his position too much. That changed on June 15, when police and landless peasants clashed in eastern Paraguay, resulting in 17 deaths. Peasants fired on police who were trying to evict them from private property, initiating the deadly confrontation, local authorities and state-run media said. The violence occurred in Curuguaty, a remote community about 240 kilometers (150 miles) northeast of the Paraguayan capital, Asuncion, near the Brazilian border. In response to the incident, Lugo replaced his national police chief and interior minister. The country's liberal party, which backed Lugo, were incensed to learn that the new minister was from another party. As the outcry over the deadly clash continued, the liberal party announced Thursday that it was withdrawing its support of Lugo, and an impeachment vote was heard in the lower chamber of congress that day. The vote in favor of impeachment was 76-1. The next day, Lugo's defense team had two hours to defend Lugo from what it call vague charges of incompetence. The Senate impeached the president in a 39-4 vote. That was it. Lugo said Paraguayan history and democracy had been ""deeply wounded."" The presidents of Venezuela, Argentina, Bolivia, Ecuador and the Dominican Republic said they will not recognize Franco's administration. Mexico's foreign ministry and Venezuela's Chavez said the speed in which Lugo was removed didn't give him time to mount a proper defense. Franco reiterated that the impeachment happened within the parameters of the constitution, and pointed to the large margins by which Lugo was voted out of office. ""It means that here we have a unanimous position. The Paraguayan people, I think, are satisfied with this decision,"" he said. Despite the cold shoulder from neighboring countries, Franco said he will reach out and explain the legality of Lugo's ouster and seeks to have good international relations. His goal is for Paraguay to be recognized internationally by the time he hands the government over to the next president next year, he said. Most of the countries opposed to Franco's presidency belong to the Union of South American Nations, known as UNASUR. The foreign ministers of that regional body were in Paraguay to study the issue. The United States also weighed in a more neutral manner. ""We urge all Paraguayans to act peacefully, with calm and responsibility, in the spirit of Paraguay's democratic principles,"" State Department spokeswoman Darla Jordan said. CNN's Mariano Castillo, Marilia Brocchetto and Fernando del Rincon contributed to this report.","NEW: Chile and Venezuela recall their ambassadors .

"(CNN) -- It's shaping up to be a huge week for Microsoft. On Monday, the company announced its Surface tablet platform at a hush-hush event in Los Angeles, and now Microsoft has unveiled Windows Phone 8 Apollo at its Windows Phone Summit in San Francisco. Microsoft announced eight specific platform updates for its upcoming mobile OS. We've already covered one of the most consumer-facing updates, the new Start Screen, but other changes include hardware-related features like multi-core processor and memory card support, a revamped Internet Explorer 10, shared native code between Windows Phone 8 and Windows 8, NFC support, a new Wallet hub, Nokia Maps, and Windows Phone 8 for business. Many of these updates shouldn't come as a surprise, considering all the leaks and reports that came out in February. Nor was today's announcement a full-fledged reveal like Apple's iOS 6 presentation at WWDC. Microsoft says it will unveil more end-user features in the summer. But in the meantime, these platform updates are significant, and Microsoft had a lot to say about them. Here's a deeper dive into what we can expect from Windows Phone 8. Hardware updates . As suspected, Windows Phone 8 will support multi-core chips. It's a move that will make Windows Phone more competitive with the iPhone and Android handsets, which have been able to check off multi-core support on their spec sheets for quite a while. When they launch, Windows Phone 8 devices will run on dual-core processors, specifically those from Qualcomm. ""The experience that people have had on a single-core will get much, much better as we move to dual-core,"" Joe Belfiore, manager of the Windows Phone Program, said at the event. Windows Phone 8 will also support three screen resolutions. (Windows Phone 7.5 supports just one.) The new screen resolutions include WVGA at 800×480 pixels and a 15:9 aspect ratio; WXGA at 1280×769 and 15:9; and 720p at 1280×720 at 16:9. Rounding out the hardware story, Windows Phone 8 will support microSD card expansion. Hardware manufacturers can include a microSD slot for users to easily transfer information from device to device. ""What this enables is that an end user can add a MicroSD card months after they've bought a phone and transfer information from PC to phone, and phone to phone,"" Belfiore said. ""We didn't want to deliver this feature until we could do it where it's easy to use."" Revamped Internet Explorer 10 . Microsoft showed off a new Internet Explorer browser for Windows Phone 8. The new IE 10 features Smart Screen, an anti-phishing filter that uses data from Windows PCs to block malicious websites in real time. Belfiore showed off how IE 10 can protect users who might fall victim to scam links sent via email. IE 10 also receives a JavaScript update — JavaScript is now four times faster than the browser in Windows PHone 7.5, according to the company. There's also twice as much HTML5 support. How does mobile IE 10 compare to other mobile browsers? According to recent SunSpider scores that measures a browser's JavaScript execution performance, IE 10 performed the best. Shared Native Code . Windows Phone 8 will share native C and C++ code with Windows 8, making it easier for developers to create apps for both platforms. It's not something that consumers will immediately notice when they use the OS, but Microsoft hopes shared native code will lead to better, faster app development — and thus more quality apps in Windows Phone Marketplace. ""The biggest effect this will have is we're going to see some freaking killer games this year,"" Belfiore said. At its developer summit, Microsoft continually hammered on how easy it will be for developers to port games from Windows 8 to Windows Phone 8, and vice versa. ""Suddenly, with Windows Phone 8 with that shared core, taking an app from the PC to phone is very straightforward,"" Belfiore said. In essence, native code will enable developers to write high-performance code — which is why games are such a big deal — and drive hardware acceleration. ""You're going to see some beefy, powerful phones running some amazing games this year,"" Belfiore said. NFC Sharing . As suspected, Windows Phone 8 devices will support NFC sharing. NFC isn't a totally new technology, but it's far from ubiquitous, so it's interesting to see Microsoft pushing it forward. Belfiore demoed how NFC would work in a Lexus advertisement with an embedded tag — he used the April issue of Wired magazine, actually: With a simple tap of his phone on top of the advertisement, he transferred product information directly to his Windows Phone. Also, sharing isn't limited to just phones. The new Microsoft platform supports NFC between phones, laptops, slates, and PCs. And NFC also has an important role in the next platform update.... Wallet Experience . Windows Phone 8 will feature a new Wallet hub where users can store their credit and debit card information, third-party loyalty and membership cards, and coupons and deals. It's not unlike Apple's iOS 6 Passbook app. But Windows Phone Wallet experience will also support NFC tap-to-pay. Yes, it's like Google Wallet, but with one fundamental difference. All of your credit and debit card information will be stored in a secure SIM card, not in an on-device system. Google Wallet is built directly into a device, making it impossible to move your Wallet info from one device to the next, but Windows Phone has opted for a more transition-friendly option. Microsoft's approach is also an experience that carriers prefer. But don't get too excited just yet, as the NFC tap-to-pay capabilities won't be coming to the United States until next year. At launch, the capability will be limited to the France-based Orange carrier. US Windows 8 consumers, however, will still be able to access the Wallet hub as their central location for cards, third-party services, and deals. Goodbye Bing Maps, Hello Nokia Maps . Say goodbye to Bing Maps. Windows Phone 8 maps will run on Nokia's mapping technology, built directly into the onboard Maps app. There's not too much news on this front, but this development isn't surprising considering Microsoft and Nokia's close ties. Some key features include: Global NAVTEQ map data, offline map support, turn-by-turn directions, and map control for developers. 3-D navigation didn't make it. Windows Phone 8 for Business . Microsoft has always had a strong hold on the enterprise market with Windows, and now it's taking all of that work and pulling it together with a business-friendly Windows Phone platform. Windows Phone 8 will come with a complete security platform with Secure Boot and encryption (which is a derivative of Windows Bitlocker). It'll make app distribution and deployment flexible for business, offering up a mechanism for private distribution and full-on onsite management. Businesses will also be able to manage Windows Phone 8 devices through a software management system. And finally, Windows Phone 8 will run the Microsoft Office suite — though we have yet to see how it will look in that mobile form. New Start Screen . Ah, the new Start Screen. ""It's the sexiest thing in Windows Phone 8,"" Belfiore said. And this should definitely the case for more visually motivated users. As we wrote in our story about the Start Screen and current Windows Phone devices, the new Start Screen is the most visible end-user feature of Windows Phone 8 (at least that's been announced so far). Microsoft has taken its Live Tiles and made them more customizable, bringing a new small size to the experience. ""These live tiles are the heart and soul of the Windows Phone,"" Belfiore said. ""We know that our users really love their phones, and we think the biggest reason is because Live Tiles make the phones so special and so personal."" Users will be able to choose between a small, medium and large size for their Live Tiles. And now the entire screen is available for Live Tile pinning — the arrow and empty space on the right-hand side have dissapeared. To that end, users can pin more on their Start Screen. And of course, Windows Phone 8 and Windows 8 are coming even closer together. As Microsoft said, they're ""better together."" ""The intent in our changing the Live Tiles support is not just to make Live Tiles more personal, but to give a more consistent experience between Windows 8 Live Tiles and Windows Phone 8 live tiles,"" Belfiore said.

"(CNN) -- David Remes used to be a partner at a top Washington law firm, but he left four years ago to defend, for free, prisoners at the U.S. military facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. It seemed like a good idea at the time. The U.S. Supreme Court had just opened its door to Guantanamo prisoners in Boumediene v. Bush. The case recognized the prisoners' right to challenge their detentions in court, even if they weren't U.S. citizens and even though they were imprisoned abroad. At the time, the controversial detention center was frequently in headlines and talked about on the campaign trail. As one of his first acts in office, President Barack Obama signed an executive order requiring that the Guantanamo Bay detention facility be closed within a year. Three and a half years later, it's still open, and it's faded from the public eye. Earlier this month, the Supreme Court refused to take a fresh look at the habeas corpus petitions by the suspected foreign enemy fighters for the second year in a row. Supreme Court declines fresh review of Guantanamo detainee issue . Guantanamo prisoners still have the right to challenge their detentions, Remes said, but it's more symbolic than real. In his opinion, the Supreme Court has shut the door on Guantanamo. ""I wouldn't say I'm numb,"" Remes told CNN. ""But I am realistic. I tell my clients my pessimism has never failed me. I don't want to give them hope unless there is hope. There's less hope now than ever."" Hear CNN's Libby Lewis talk to David Remes on iTunes about the court's decision . Of the 169 people still detained, the government says 89 aren't a threat, but Obama and Congress have blocked their release. As for the rest, some of them have a shot at a military hearing, but 46 don't have that chance because the government says they can't be tried for one reason or another but are too dangerous to be released. ""So now, the executive is against transfers, Congress is against transfers and the courthouse doors are shut,"" Remes says. ""All three branches of the government are aligned against us."" If there was any Guantanamo prisoner case that lawyers thought the Supreme Court would take up, it was Adnan Latif's of Yemen. Remes is his lawyer. Federal appeals court rules against Guantanamo detainee . The government says Latif went to Afghanistan to fight for al Qaeda. Latif says he went to Afghanistan and Pakistan to get medical treatment with the help of an Islamic charity. He's been at Guantanamo for 10 years. ""Adnan is a very disturbed young man,"" Remes says. ""He has been in the psych ward. He's been on suicide watch. He has eaten screws, urine cups, plastic bags. He would smear excrement all over his body. I once said to him: How can you stand the smell? He said, 'That's nothing compared to what I'm feeling.' "" Over the years, Remes has gotten to know Latif. He says he's familiar with his mental problems, his apparent suicide attempts, his poetry. At one meeting he had with his client -- then in his seventh year as a prisoner -- Remes says Latif threw a cup of his blood on him. He'd cut a vein in his wrist and let the blood flow into an empty cup under the table where they sat. The next time they met, Remes says, the prison guards had Latif in so many restraints that Remes had to call a federal judge for help when Latif wanted to use the bathroom. They had to litigate it over the phone. He said the judge ""didn't want to second-guess the security aspect and he said, 'Well, he's got to be able to clean himself,' "" Remes said. About a year later, that same judge, U.S. District Judge Henry H. Kennedy, reviewed the evidence against Latif in a petition for habeas corpus -- the right that was granted to Guantanamo prisoners in the Boumediene case. Kennedy found the government's evidence, based on an intelligence report by U.S. agents, wasn't reliable enough to keep Latif locked up. And he found Latif's story was plausible, so he ordered Latif's release in July 2010. But in a 2-1 vote, the appeals court that reviews all Guantanamo habeas cases reversed that in October 2011. The appeals court said Kennedy should have automatically presumed the government's intelligence report on Latif was reliable and rejected the case. Latif is still a prisoner at Guantanamo. Federal appeals court rules against Guantanamo detainee . After the Supreme Court turned down Latif's case on June 11, Remes called Latif to tell him. He also called Latif's family in Yemen. Remes asked Latif's younger brother, Ibrahim, whether he had any questions. Ibrahim wanted to know why his brother hadn't been released even though a federal judge said he should be. Remes said he explained what happened, and they talked a bit more. Then, Remes said Ibrahim thanked him ""from the depth of my family's heart for all you have done,"" and hung up.","Lawyer David Remes says the Supreme Court has shut down on Guantanamo .

"(CNN) -- Talks continued Saturday in Bolivia, where a police mutiny over pay has included the storming of buildings and a hunger strike by officers' wives. Bottom-rank officers across the country are demanding a substantial pay increase and a retirement pension equal to their current salaries. They have a monthly base salary of $115 and want a jump to $287. Other demands include the resignation of their commander. The hunger strike, started by 60 spouses, began this week and was being held in La Paz and other cities. The tension rose Thursday when mutineers entered a building used by higher-level officers. Friday, protesters raided police intelligence offices, seizing computers and burning investigation documents. Protesters threw rocks while others burned papers, furniture and other items in the street. Government officials appealed for peaceful negotiations. ""The best way to continue working on these requirements is not by way of pressure or to seize and occupy public offices,"" said Carlos Romero, minister of government. ""It's not by destroying of public property, by burning documents -- it's not the way."" Protesting police are in charge of controlling the massive demonstrations that occur frequently in La Paz. Members of Bolivia's armed forces have taken over many of the tasks performed by police. Ombudsman Rolando Villena raised concerns about citizen safety. ""We are concerned about the helplessness in which the population is in,"" he said. ""The absence of protection by the police. We call upon both parties to seek a solution within the framework of dialogue."" Journalist Gloria Carrasco contributed to this report.","Bolivian police demand higher pay, pensions .

"(CNN) -- With three places up for grabs on the U.S. Olympic track team, two women tied for third place in the women's 100 meters over the weekend -- crossing the line at exactly the same time -- which means the coveted Olympic spot could be decided by a coin toss. Sprinters Allyson Felix and Jeneba Tarmoh threw their bodies across the finish line so evenly matched that cameras recording 3,000 frames a second couldn't tell who beat whom. Both runners recorded precisely the same finishing time, down to thousandths of a second: 11.068 seconds. Two women beat Felix and Tarmoh: Carmelita Jeter and Tianna Madison. Their first and second place finishes on Saturday give them the chance to represent the United States at the Olympics in London this summer. But the photo finish leaves USA Track & Field with a dilemma: Who gets the third slot? There appears to be no precedent for a dead heat at U.S. Olympic Team track and field trials, prompting the U.S. Olympic Committee to announce new rules Sunday. One of the runners can give up her claim to a spot on the Olympic team. If neither one takes that unlikely option, they'll be asked if they want to run a tie-breaking race or flip a coin. If they choose the same option, the committee will respect their wishes. If they disagree, they'll have to race for it. And if both athletes refuse to declare a preference, officials will flip a coin -- a U.S. quarter to be exact. Leaving nothing to chance, other than the flip itself, the rules also detail who gets to pick heads or tails and how the coin should be flipped. ""The USATF representative shall bend his or her index finger at a 90-degree angle to his or her thumb, allowing the coin to rest on his or her thumb,"" the rules say. No date has been set for the tie-breaker to take. Both women have other races to run over the course of the week.","Allyson Felix and Jeneba Tarmoh cross the line at exactly the same time, cameras show .

The tall, rangy man in the dented hat signing autographs could just as easily have been Ford's stunt double, Vic Armstrong. Back then, in the right light Armstrong could easily be mistaken for Ford -- both of them over six feet tall and bronzed with crinkly eyes. And it's this that is at the root of his success as Indy's ""fall guy."" In fact, Ford is a talented stuntman in his own right and Armstrong says that his biggest headache on set was trying to stop Ford from getting involved in action that was too risky. ""The biggest stunt I always say on the Indiana Jones films was stopping Harrison doing the stunts because I had to fight nearly every time to stop him,"" Armstrong chuckles. An accomplished horseman (his first career choice was steeplechase jockey), it's Armstrong's Indy you see galloping along in the stained khaki shirt and jumping from his horse onto a tank in ""The Last Crusade."" ""Technically very difficult,"" Armstrong says, ""I had to rely on a horse, and horses have a sense of survival and they don't actually do what you tell them to do as they haven't read the script."" It may have been his close resemblance to Ford that clinched the ""Raiders"" job but the pair developed a rapport that led Armstrong to work on the other two installments of the trilogy, ""Temple of Doom"" and ""The Last Crusade."" ""It always works better if you do have a relationship with [the actor]. You can mimic how they move, how they work when you coordinate fights for them like I did with Harrison,"" Armstrong tells CNN. Armstrong was just 16 years old when he started in the stunt industry in 1965. He utilised his horseriding skills to double as Gregory Peck in spy movie ""Arabesque."" He had to jump a huge moat and then fall off his mount but it was the simple lifestyle and travel that hooked young Armstrong -- ""Forty dollars a day and all you can eat. Fantastic living."" After over 40 years and countless movies, his filmography reads like a who's who of Hollywood: he has doubled for Sean Connery, Donald Sutherland, John Voight and collaborated with directors like Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven, Michael Cimino and Sir Richard Attenborough. His work for three decades on classic Bond films like ""You Only Live Twice"" and ""Live and Let Die"" cemented his reputation as a stuntman who could pull off complicated of stunts with precision. ""The films I've done I've been very lucky to have been very prolific in an area and a time when iconic films were being made. ""My first stunt on a Bond film was in 1966 in the winter of ""You Only Live Twice"". I was one of the ninjas coming down firing guns into the volcano, which for me was sensational."" He doubled for Roger Moore in ""Live and Let Die"" for a short while and was then propelled into working as a stunt coordinator and director of action units. Armstrong then added a superhero to his already impressive roster of action idols, standing in for Christopher Reeve in ""Superman."" Despite this, his allegiances lie solidly with cinema's 'real' heroes. ""If you look at ""Spiderman"" and movies like that, or the ""Incredible Hulk,"" they are far more computer-generated and so therefore slightly more cartoonish or video game-ish. ""My personal preference is for real action just enhanced or maybe helped by computers. We use computers to take away fall pads or wires if you're getting snatched or thrown in the air."" And in the spirit of keeping it real, Armstrong has gone to great lengths to help stuntmen achieve their crazy feats as safely as possible. In the 1980s he modified a tool known as the ""fan descender"" for the film ""Green Ice."" It would allow stuntmen to safely slow down when performing high freefalls. It revolutionized the stunt industry and in 2002 he was awarded a Science and Technology Academy Award for his invention -- the only one ever handed out to a stunt man. Earlier this year, he was honored by the Screen Actors Guild for his work on 2007 action horror ""I am Legend."" He has just finished work on ""The Mummy 3"" -- it was his prior commitment to this movie that stopped him working on the fourth Indy film ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" -- and is now stunt coordinating on the Weinstein production ""Shanghai."" Even after all this time, Armstrong, the authority on how to create a death defying stunt, still reckons Ford is the best stuntman actor he has ever worked with -- ""Harrison has to be the ultimate."" So why bother with a stunt double? ""I was cheaper and it didn't matter if I got hurt.""","Vic Armstrong was Harrison Ford's stunt double in the Indiana Jones movies .

"(CNN) -- After years of resisting calls from fans, sports pundits and even President Barack Obama, key conference commissioners announced Thursday that they'd propose some variation of a college football playoff. The leaders of numerous interscholastic athletic conferences -- including the Big 12, Big Ten and Southeastern Conference -- and Notre Dame released a joint statement Thursday signaling its intentions following ongoing deliberations about postseason play in college football. In it, they stated that an eight-team and a 16-team playoff were not going to happen because doing so would ""diminish the regular season and harm the bowls."" That refers to the existing system, in which winning top-level teams traditionally get the chance to play in one postseason bowl game after they've finished their regular season. Yet the conference commissioners opened the door to a pared down playoff. ""We will present to our conferences a very small number of four-team options, each of which could be carried out in a number of ways,"" the commissioners said. The statement noted that ongoing topics of discussion, as they relate to the playoff proposal, include whether these extra games will occur on ""campus sites or neutral sites,"" how they'd be incorporated into the present bowl structure and how teams would qualify. ""Our process is proceeding as planned, and we look forward to further conversations,"" the commissioners said. College football's leadership resistance to a playoff system, which exists in many other interscholastic sports, has elicited strong reactions for years. Among many others, Obama weighed in just days before his inauguration in January 2009 when he said, ""We need a playoff."" SI.com: Happy V-BCS Day . Currently, the BCS system limits automatic bids to the winners of the Big Ten, Big East, Big 12, Atlantic Coast Conference, Pac 12 and the Southeastern Conference, thereby leaving out other conferences, including almost all the schools in the Rocky Mountain region. Only two remaining at-large spots are available to all other colleges and universities. The top two ranked teams, as judged by the system's criteria, play in a championship game. Some contend that under the present setup, strong teams that are not in the more prestigious athletic conferences unfairly lose out on potentially millions of dollars in revenue. The U.S. Justice Department sent a letter last May to the National Collegiate Athletic Association stating that the Bowl Championship Series, or BCS, system ""may not be conducted consistent with the competition principles expressed in federal antitrust laws."" This letter was released after Sen. Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican and major opponent of the existing system, raised the issue with Attorney General Eric Holder at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. Holder responded that the Justice Department had sent the letter to the NCAA about the issue. Afterward, BCS Executive Director Bill Hancock said the current system had ""improved competition"" and ""dramatically increased access to top-tier bowl games for schools from (nonautomatic qualifying) conferences."" ""The BCS was carefully created with antitrust laws in mind, and I am confident that it is fully compliant with those laws,"" Hancock said then.","BCS commissioners rule out an 8- or 16-team college football playoff .

"(CNN) -- Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods will predictably be among the favorites for this week's Masters Tournament, but another name slipped into title contention on Sunday. Hunter Mahan's victory at the Houston Open lifted him up to fourth in the world rankings, higher than any other American who will be playing at the golf season's opening major at Augusta National. Mahan's one-shot victory over Sweden's Carl Petterson launched him to the top of the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup standings, but more importantly he showed a new mental strength that may help him win one of the sport's four biggest events this year. ""I felt like this week my mind was probably the strongest part of my game. That's a great thing to feel for sure,"" he told the PGA Tour's official website after becoming the first two-time winner of 2012, following up his victory at the World Match Play Championship in late February -- when he beat McIlroy in the final. ""When you play a major, you're going to have to have all facets of the game, especially your mind has to be a strength. What I'm going to take from this week is that my mind was so strong, I was able to persevere through some ... you know, having the lead and doing something I haven't done before.'' The 29-year-old had won three PGA events before this year, but is perhaps best known for his emotional defeat in the final game of the 2010 Ryder Cup teams event when he broke down in tears after losing the decider to Europe's Graeme McDowell. ""I felt like I could be a good player in this game, but to win twice this year and be fourth, it feels great, really does. It shows me what I can do, shows me what I'm capable of,'' Mahan said. ""I wasn't reaching my potential, in a way. I think great players, when you see them, their head is always up. They never seem to get down. They might get upset over a shot, but don't get down on themselves over a shot. It just never seems to bother them. ""You also watch Tiger ... I played with him last week. He's just got that confidence and that swagger back where it's just head up, chest back and ready to go play. You got to be positive in this game -- it's too hard. Hitting a good shot might be hitting it 30 feet (from the pin). You don't have to hit it (to) two feet for it to be a good shot.'' Mahan said he is enjoying the game more with his new approach. ""I think I'm just tired of doing it the wrong way,'' he said. ""What I was doing before, it stunk. It wasn't any fun. We play so many holes, play so many tournaments -- it just doesn't make sense to beat yourself up, you know, because the game is hard enough.'' Mahan said he had thought about skipping the Texas tournament, where he had finished in the top eight three times in five years. But the prospect of having to spend extra time at such a daunting place as Augusta, where he has twice made the top 10 in the last three years, made the decision to play at Redstone a simple one. ""I didn't like the idea of spending so much time there before the tournament, and the hardest part of that tournament is Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, because you're just sitting around and seeing the course. You can't wait to get started,'' he said. Mahan will seek to preserve a remarkable statistic in a sport where good putting is often the difference between success and failure -- he has not three-putted in 102 holes, more than five and a half rounds of golf. But one player missing from the Masters field is South Africa's three-time major champion Ernie Els. The 42-year-old, twice a runner-up at the Masters, needed to win in Houston to earn a starting place but finished six shots back and will not line up at Augusta for the first time since 1993. Petterson finished on 15-under 273, one shot ahead of 2010 British Open champion Louis Oosthuizen of South Africa, who fell away from contention with a 75. Three-time Masters champion Phil Mickelson tied for fourth on 276 in a group including 2011 PGA Championship winner Keegan Bradley.","Hunter Mahan climbs up to a career-high fourth in golf's world rankings .

"(CNN) -- With the inevitability of Mitt Romney's GOP presidential nomination now assured, the next question looming in this long, twisted election cycle is likely to be this: Which Mitt Romney will be running against President Barack Obama? In a perfect Mitt World, Romney would have been able to stay in his comfort zone, touting his economic prowess vs. the nation's (read: Obama's) economic failures. But a covey of conservative Republican opponents fueled with super PAC money and jazzed by tea party frenzy forced him from the middle and into an increasingly conservative persona, culminating in his somewhat plaintive declaration that he was ""severely"" conservative. With his need to compete for the Republican right now ebbing, will Romney migrate back to the center, hoping that a good shake of the Etch A Sketch will create a clean slate to start courting moderates and independents? He can only wish it were that easy. There is little doubt that Romney, like most presidential candidates before him, will recast his message for a general election. His problem in doing so, however, is his well-established record as a political chameleon who changes colors to match the polemics of his strongest political rival. In a weird through-the-looking-glass transformation that echoes through Romney's political career, Mitt the candidate often takes on some of the positions and personality traits of his opponents. When he challenged Ted Kennedy for the U.S. Senate seat in 1994, Romney became Moderate Mitt, staking out a painfully sincere middle ground stance on abortion. Watching him in debate with Kennedy, viewers can be excused for thinking they have wandered into an earlier ""Saturday Night Live"" skit. Romney's tortured answer wiggles one way -- he says he will support and defend Roe v. Wade -- then wiggles the other by saying his family, including his mom, had its own beliefs ""but we will not force our beliefs on others on that matter. And you will not see me wavering on that."" Kennedy puts it more simply. ""I support pro-choice,"" he says. ""My opponent is multiple choice."" The line drew a burst of applause. Romney ran a similar campaign for governor in 2002, modeling the same moderate positions of the two liberal Republican governors who preceded him. He took the same tortured tack on abortion as in 1994; his campaign courted Log Cabin Republicans, promising, according to members who attended a meeting, to be a supporter of gay rights and to stay out of the gay marriage case making its way through the state courts. There was little change in his political stance in the first year of his governorship. No social initiatives came out of the governor's office. Most of his work revolved around the annual budget process, a Beacon Hill ritual in which the governor, Republican or Democrat, presents a budget to the Massachusetts legislature, which quickly dismantles the plan and replaces it with its own agenda, overriding any eventual veto attempts by the governor. Then came two events that forced the governor out of his comfort zone of moderation. The first was the state's Supreme Judicial Court's 2003 ruling that a ban on same-sex marriage was unconstitutional. With his eyes already set on the White House, Romney faced the unplanned prospect of running for president as the governor from the first same-sex marriage state in the union. Fortunately for him, however, he had no real constitutional power to do anything other than to act as a sideline cheerleader for a proposed constitutional amendment that would have allowed civil unions but not same-sex marriage. The amendment eventually failed in the legislature. In the meantime, Romney did some executive huffing and puffing, summoning up a dusty 1914 miscegenation statute that barred out-of-state couples from marrying in Massachusetts if their union was prohibited at home. The order was dropped after municipal clerks complained about the extra work it would bring. But mostly Romney was able to use rhetoric to play to conservatives while taking no action that would offend the liberals. Perhaps the more significant, and less noted, event that forced Romney to switch his protective coloring was the resignation in September 2004 of House Speaker Tom Finneran, a staunch social conservative who ruled the Massachusetts House with an iron hand. A singular power in the legislature, Finneran controlled all action in the House, keeping liberal proposals from advancing out of committee. With Finneran as sentinel, Romney was spared from making any decisions on legislation that could haunt him in Republican primaries. Finneran's departure in advance of federal obstruction of justice charges -- he eventually pleaded guilty -- forced Romney to drop his Massachusetts Mitt persona. With a more liberal Democratic speaker in place, who is now doing time in federal prison, Romney had no place to hide as hot-button issues such as stem cell research, the morning-after pill and various bills on sexual orientation rights escaped the legislature and made it onto his desk. He faced a turning point. Sign those bills and safeguard his position for another run for governor or oppose them to curry favor with the more conservative Republican voters he would need to win a presidential nomination. He chose the latter, beginning his long public transformation to Severely Conservative Mitt. Even back then, reporters covering the Massachusetts State House could anticipate carefully crafted statements by Romney on any social issue likely to come up when he shared the dais with Republican presidential primary rivals. His one major legacy as governor -- the health care reform bill for which Massachusetts Democrats now honor him -- was part of that same Romney political calculus. When he collaborated with the Democratic leadership to pass the law, the central fixture of individual mandate was within a general Republican ideology for reforming health care. But Romney's dream of being the savior of the health care crisis became a nightmare when conservatives demonized a Democratic president for the same legislation. Romney couldn't get a break from his Massachusetts legacy. In the last two years of his governorship, Romney was out of state campaigning for president more often than he was in his State House office. His campaign patter often included digs at liberal Massachusetts, such as the time he described himself as ""a vegetarian at a cattle ranch."" The tactic didn't increase the love in Massachusetts. In March 2005, he had a 55-to-41 favorable to unfavorable rating. Those numbers continued to decline over the next two years. By November 2006, as his term was ending, his numbers dropped to 37-to-52 favorable to unfavorable. Only 29% said they would vote for him again. Some say Romney's shifting persona is nothing new to American politics. Even Abraham Lincoln tailored his message to the audience or electorate he was trying to woo. But the politicians who win elections and leave legacies keep to core ideals. Romney may have such ideals tucked away in a lockbox, but who can tell? His often ham-handed attempts to win over whatever demographic he is targeting this week creates a stink of insincerity that trails him even when he actually means what he says. That will be the problem for whichever Romney we see over the next months. Whatever message he chooses, part of the audience will wonder if the Mitt Romney they are seeing will be the same one they might vote for. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Fred Bayles.","Fred Bayles: Romney courted conservatives; with nomination in bag, what's next?

Copeland, 24, is doing so well that she got into a wheelchair and left her hospital room for the first time Sunday, her father wrote Monday on his blog. ""In your mind's eye, you probably are picturing Aimee grabbing a wheelchair and scooting into it by herself and then rolling herself through doorways and down hallways like some superhuman quad amputee,"" Andy Copeland wrote.

""'I mean that I am blessed to have the opportunity to experience something that not many other people have the chance to experience,'"" Copeland wrote, recalling his daughter's words. ""'I am blessed to be able to have a challenge that not many others get to have. I am blessed to have the capacity to share my experience with others and have a chance to improve the quality of someone else's life. I'm blessed to be different.'"" Aimee Copeland's ordeal began May 1, when she was riding a makeshift zip line across the Little Tallapoosa River, about 50 miles west of Atlanta. The line snapped, and she fell and got a gash in her left calf that took 22 staples to close. Three days later, still in pain, she went to an emergency room. Doctors eventually determined she had necrotizing fasciitis caused by the bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila. The bacteria led surgeons to amputate most of her hands, part of her abdomen, one of her legs and her remaining foot in an effort to stay ahead of the infection. She has also had multiple skin grafts. Her father has written regularly since about her situation, with over 78,000 ""likes"" on his Facebook blog devoted to Aimee's fight. A number of bacteria that are common in the environment but rarely cause serious infections can lead to the condition. When the bacteria gets into the bloodstream -- such as through a cut -- doctors typically move aggressively to excise even healthy tissue near the infection site in hopes of ensuring none of the dangerous bacteria remain. The infection attacks and destroys healthy tissue and is fatal about 20% of the time, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of the Department of Preventive Medicine at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, estimates that fewer than 250 such cases occur each year in the United States, though estimates are imprecise since doctors do not have to report the cases to health authorities.

"(CNN) -- The biggest change in Arizona since the state adopted a tough immigration enforcement policy two years ago has been a more tolerant climate for immigrants, representatives from several groups said Monday. ""There has been a change in Arizona, without a doubt,"" said Clarissa Martinez, director of immigration for the National Council of La Raza, which led a coalition of civil rights groups in a tourism boycott of the state after SB 1070 became law in the spring of 2010. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled Monday that three of the law's four key provisions infringed on the federal government's constitutional jurisdiction over immigration. The high court let stand the provision allowing police to check a person's immigration status while enforcing other laws. Supreme Court strikes down key parts of Arizona law . There were dire warnings by critics when the law took effect in July 2010 that it would keep businesses and people from moving to the state and that it would drive families away. There is no good measure of how many Hispanic families, fearing persecution by law enforcement, moved from Arizona. The boycott targeting Arizona's $18 billion tourism industry and others by local governments, including the city of Los Angeles, got the attention of Arizona's business leaders. ""An increasing number of voices in the business community started cautioning the legislature about continuing on this path,"" Martinez said. The tourism boycott, which one study estimated cost the state's hotels $141 million in convention business, was lifted last fall ""at the request of community organizations, businesses and elected officials who were working to create a new environment in the state,"" Martinez said. Analysis: Five things we learned from court's ruling . While it's hard to pinpoint how much damage the controversy did to Arizona's hotel industry, occupancy rates have increased in the past year, according to Smith Travel Research, a company that tracks data for the hotel industry. Those figures are about in line with the national average. ""Indicators are showing that we had an increase in tourism"" in 2011, said Kiva Couchon, spokeswoman for the Arizona Office of Tourism. ""The trend line is moving upward."" An effort to pass even tougher anti-immigrant measures was rejected by Arizona's legislature last year, she said. Winners, losers in immigration policy debate? ""Arizona's business community came out in force saying 'Please don't do this,'"" said Marshall Fitz of the Center for American Progress, a Washington-based public policy think tank. One trigger for this was the economic sanctions imposed by several local governments, including Los Angeles. Those resolutions, passed after the Gov. Jan Brewer signed SB 1070 into law, limited contracts with companies based in Arizona. Gov. Brewer: Obama administration launched 'assault' Those boycotts caused ""a lot of heartburn for companies here that saw potential customers outside the state dwindle, "" Arizona Chamber of Commerce spokesman Garrick Taylor said. Last November, voters recalled SB 1070's architect, Russell Pearce, from his state senate post, replacing him in November with a Republican who opposed the immigration crackdown. ""Arizonans are coming together to undo the tarnished image of their state that was inflicted on them by their governor and Sen. Pearce,"" Martinez said. The controversy ""galvanized communities in Arizona"" and ""served as a wake up call to increase participation in the electoral process,"" she said. Supreme Court's ruling at a glance . The shift against the immigration measures came ""because people realize they don't want to be in a state that's suppose to be a vacation spot or a place to retire, but has an international reputation of being inhospitable and a place of intolerance,"" Fitz said. Luring new businesses to the state is tougher with the ""tarnished brand"" caused by the immigration law controversy, he said. ""A business trying to decide to open a new plant or new office in one of two place -- either Arizona or New Mexico -- (isn't) going to think twice about."" The backlash has put the state ""on the cusp of a tipping point, where Arizona is going the way of California with the demographic changes and the desire to move away from a tarnished inhospitality,"" Fitz said. The state could, like California, become a Democratic stronghold, he said.

"(CNN) -- The weather in St. Pete Beach had been bad all day, so Laura Miller and Brenda Pace hunkered down to watch a baseball game on television. But conditions outside Sunday night quickly went from bad to worse, they said Monday, as Tropical Storm Debby spawned a suspected tornado. ""The winds started picking up,"" Miller said. ""We heard the proverbial noise -- the train -- the transformer blew, the windows started busting out. It was just very chaotic, all the glass flying, the debris flying into the house. It was pretty intense."" They looked for a place to hide, but the door to their ground-floor bathroom wouldn't open. ""We managed to get between the refrigerator and the pantry area and just ride it out,"" Miller said. A suspected waterspout may have roared ashore and become a tornado in their neighborhood, the Pass-A-Grille area of St. Pete Beach, according to CNN affiliate WFLA. Pace said she was still in shock, but ""it's amazing we got out without a scratch."" Two people had minor injuries, said St. Pete Beach Fire Marshal Ernest Hand. Eight properties in the area sustained major damage and 24 had minor damage. ""We were lucky,"" he said. ""It was so windy and rainy, I couldn't go outside to look,"" resident Michael Hamm told WFLA. ""Ten or 15 minutes later, when I did, I noticed the roof was gone over the deck, the picnic tables had blown off, the railing was gone, the electricity was off. ... We didn't get hurt, so we're very lucky."" Elsewhere in Florida, one person was killed in an apparent tornado on Sunday, officials said. Debby remained offshore Monday but continued to pose a threat of tornadoes, heavy rain, additional flooding and high winds to much of Florida as it slogged slowly to the northeast. Floridians were warned the rain may stick around through the week in some areas. A few tornadoes were possible Monday across the eastern Florida Panhandle, the Florida peninsula and southern Georgia, forecasters said. A large swath of Florida was under a tornado watch until Monday afternoon. Numerous flood watches and warnings were also posted. As of 1 p.m. Monday, Debby was centered about 50 miles south-southwest of Apalachicola in the Florida Panhandle, the National Hurricane Center said. The storm had weakened slightly, with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph. However, tropical-storm-force winds -- those 39 mph or stronger -- extended 230 miles out from its center, mainly to the southeast. ""Debby is a large tropical cyclone, with the strongest winds and much of the heaviest rainfall well removed from the center of circulation,"" the hurricane center said. After being nearly stationary overnight, Debby began inching northeast Monday at about 5 mph. ""Tropical storm conditions will continue over portions of the Florida Gulf Coast today,"" forecasters said. Debby is expected to dump a total of 10 to 20 inches of rain over northern and central Florida, with 25 inches possible in some areas, forecasters said. A total of about 5 to 15 inches of rain is possible across coastal southeastern Georgia and extreme southeastern South Carolina, according to the hurricane center. Total rain accumulations of 5 to 10 inches are expected over central Florida and southeast Georgia into coastal South Carolina, with isolated maximum amounts of 15 inches possible, forecasters said. CNN iReporters sent pictures and video of flooding in their areas. Magalie Caragiorgio said Monday she has been stuck in her New Port Richey, Florida, home since Sunday because of flooding and hasn't been able to get to her job as a nurse. ""It's unnerving because you can't do anything,"" she said. ""I guess I wasn't prepared. I wasn't expecting to be flooded out like this."" In Wilton Manors, Florida, ""the flooding cut off access to everyone's homes until it subsided,"" said iReporter Jon Carson. ""... I have a small car so I was terrified about how I was going to get the kids to school."" In Panama City, some tourists stuck around to ride out the storm, said iReporter and restaurant employee Michael Dunning. ""Usually people pack up and leave when they hear about a storm,"" he said. ""It was just another storm, lots of wind and rain."" Chris Anuszkiewicz of Clearwater, Florida, said water came through his garage and front door. ""I've been through hurricanes on the beach here, and the rain from this was more intense,"" he said. The U.S. Coast Guard in Mobile said it rescued a family that became stranded on Dog Island, south of Carrabelle, Florida, by weather associated with Debby. The Coast Guard said Monday it received a phone call about 12:30 p.m. Sunday from a man saying his family, including five adults, four children and two dogs, was stranded in a vacation house located on a narrow sandbar on southwest Dog Island. ""Water was reportedly surrounding the house, and there was no way for them to evacuate to higher ground,"" the Coast Guard said in a statement. ""The commercial vessel that brought the family to the island would not come back for them due to the weather conditions from the storm."" The Coast Guard dispatched a helicopter and rescue crew, which were able to evacuate the family. All those rescued were examined by medics and found to be uninjured. Citing the threat of heavy rainfall and potential tornadoes, Florida Gov. Rick Scott on Monday declared a state of emergency ""so we can coordinate the use of all state resources to make sure we can respond promptly if anything happens."" He warned residents to expect ""a significant amount of rain."" Pinellas County also declared a state of local emergency on Monday, officials said. Crews in Sarasota County were assessing flooding, and the county was asking residents to reduce their water usage, as its water reclamation facilities were ""reaching treatment capacity,"" said county spokeswoman Crystal Pruitt. The hurricane center narrowed the warning area for Debby on Monday. A tropical storm warning was in effect for the Florida Gulf Coast stretching from Destin to Englewood, Florida. The storm was expected to continue moving slowly northeast or east-northeast over the next couple of days, forecasters said. Little change in strength was expected. A revised forecast track showed Debby remaining a tropical storm until it makes landfall early Thursday near Apalachee Bay, Florida -- in the bend of the state where the Florida Panhandle ends. The storm is then expected to cross the state of Florida and head into the Atlantic Ocean south of Jacksonville as a tropical depression on Saturday. Seminole, Florida, received more than 10 inches of rain on Sunday, according to preliminary 24-hour totals from the National Weather Service. Pinellas Park, Florida, received nearly 9 inches, and the Apalachicola, Florida, airport received 8.65 inches, according to the weather service. The Ocala, Florida, airport measured nearly 8 inches. Other preliminary rainfall totals included 6.68 inches in Wakulla, Florida; 6.58 inches in Orange Springs, Florida; and 6.27 inches in St. Petersburg. On Sunday, two apparent twisters destroyed four homes in Florida's Highland County, said Gloria Rybinski, emergency operations spokeswoman for the county. A woman was found dead in a home in Venus, located in the middle of the state between Port St. Lucie and Sarasota, Rybinski said. About 35,000 people statewide were without power, Bryan Koon, director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management, told reporters. ""That number is going to fluctuate as we go through this week,"" he said. Follow Bay News 9's live blog . The Sunshine Skyway bridge, which stretches over Tampa Bay and connects Bradenton with St. Petersburg, Florida, was closed Sunday because of high winds and remained closed Monday, Pinellas County officials said. Winds in the area have been clocked at 20 to 30 mph with higher gusts, according to CNN affiliate Bay News 9. Seas were between 12 and 15 feet. Residents of a Tampa retirement home were evacuated Monday, the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office said. The Sunrise Village Retirement Home ""is located in an area that is prone to flooding and the water is up to the building right now,"" authorities said in a statement Monday morning. About 90 residents were being moved to other Sunrise Village facilities, the sheriff's office said. Debby's effects were being felt as far north as Hilton Head Island, South Carolina. CNN iReporter Greg Dee was on the beach when one of Debby's rain bands passed through. ""It began picking up sand and you could actually see it moving down the beach with the wind,"" he said. ""It felt like my legs were being sandblasted."" Video from the Tampa area showed drivers inching through water on a flooded street Sunday night, with at least one stranded. The floodwaters were beginning to recede Monday morning, but several stalled cars remained on flooded roadways, CNN affiliate WTSP reported. Forecasters warned the combination of a storm surge and the tide would cause coastal areas to be inundated with water. An area from Apalachee Bay to Waccasassa Bay, Florida, could see a 3- to 5-foot surge, while Florida's west coast south of Waccasassa Bay could see 1 to 3 feet. An area stretching from southeastern Louisiana to Apalachee Bay, Florida could get a 1- to 3-foot surge, according to the hurricane center. Officials in Alabama and Louisiana have said they are monitoring Debby's progress, given uncertainty regarding its path. The storm has raised concerns for those working on 596 manned oil and gas production platforms throughout the Gulf, run by various companies. Shell said Sunday that it had evacuated 360 staff members the previous day and was planning further evacuations. However, given the forecast shift that showed Debby steering clear of Louisiana, Shell said Monday it was in the process of redeploying staff. ""By end of day Tuesday, we will be back to normal operations across the Gulf,"" the company said. ExxonMobil said Sunday it had ""evacuated nonessential personnel"" from its offshore facilities and was preparing to evacuate the rest. And BP spokesman Brett Clanton said Sunday evening that the company has evacuated the ""majority of our offshore personnel in the Gulf of Mexico"" due to Debby. ""Those unable to be evacuated will shelter in place for the storm,"" he said.

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- South Korea fired live artillery on Monday in a military drill near the country's heavily armed border with North Korea, which has described the exercise as a provocation. The drill Monday involved howitzers, mortars and attack helicopters, South Korean news agency Yonhap reported. It took place on islands off the west coast of the Korean peninsula where tensions have flared in the past. Seoul notified the North on Sunday of the drill, a regular live-fire exercise that lasts an hour. About 1,000 island residents were moved to safe areas during the drill, Yonhap reported, citing military officials. ""This is a very dangerous play with fire to ignite a war against the North as it is a clear declaration of war against it,"" Pyongyang's state-run Korean Central News Agency reported Sunday, citing a bulletin from the Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea. In late 2010, North Korea responded to a South Korean military exercise in the same area by firing artillery at Yeonpyeong Island, killing two South Korean marines and two civilians. ""If the puppet warmongers preempt reckless firing despite our warning, they will not escape punishment thousands-fold severer"" than the shelling of Yeonpyeong Island, the bulletin said. It identified ""the puppet warmongers"" as being South Korea and the United States, which has tens of thousands of troops in South Korea. The death in December of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il and the subsequent anointment of his son and chosen successor, Kim Jong Un, has created uncertainty about the future direction of the secretive regime in Pyongyang. Further tensions over military maneuvers on the Korean peninsula are expected in the coming weeks. There are two joint exercises planned involving thousands of U.S. and South Korean forces scheduled between February and April. CNN's Paula Hancocks and Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.","South Korea holds a regular artillery drill on islands where tensions have flared before .

"(CNN) -- There are more than 2,500 people serving life sentences without the possibility of parole for crimes they committed when they were juveniles. Some were as young as 13 when they were sent to prison. In 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that life without parole for juveniles convicted of crimes other than homicide violated the Constitution's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, a ruling that extended the court's logic in its 2005 decision to abolish the juvenile death penalty. In both of these cases, the court held that because adolescents are not as responsible for their actions as adults, they should not be punished as harshly, even for the same crimes. The court relied in part on the research my colleagues and I conducted for the MacArthur Foundation Research Network on Adolescent Development and Juvenile Justice showing that adolescents are less mature than adults in ways that make them more impulsive, more short-sighted and more susceptible to peer influence, all factors that make them less culpable. On Tuesday, the court will hear appeals of two cases that ask whether life without parole is an appropriate sentence for juveniles convicted of homicide. Both cases involve people who were 14 at the time of their offense, but their crimes were very different. Kuntrell Jackson was part of a group of boys who shot a store clerk during a robbery of a video store in Arkansas; although Jackson did not do the shooting, he was found guilty of ""felony murder,"" because he was part of the group that committed a felony during which someone was killed. The other plaintiff, Evan Miller, carried out a brutal murder of a neighbor in Alabama whom he and another teenager robbed, beating the victim to death and later returning to the crime scene and setting the victim's trailer on fire to cover up the crime. The contrast between the crimes, as well as the youthfulness of the juveniles in question, creates many possible alternatives for the justices to contemplate. The court could extend the logic of its previous decisions and ban life without parole for juveniles unequivocally, on the grounds that even the most heinous crime doesn't magically turn a 14-year-old into an adult. On the other hand, the court could decide that ""death is different"" and rule that life in prison is an appropriate punishment for someone who has committed murder, regardless of his age. In between these two extremes are numerous middle grounds. They include banning life without parole for juveniles convicted of felony murder but not other types of murder; banning life without parole for youths 14 and younger, but leaving undecided the constitutionality of this sentence for older teens; permitting life without parole for juveniles as an option but prohibiting it as a mandatory sentence, as it now is in about two-thirds of states that permit it; and various combinations of these alternatives. Opinion: Why are millions of Americans locked up? The argument in favor of life without parole for people convicted of murder is that the sentence is necessary to deter crime, protect public safety and remove from society those who are thought to be incorrigible. It is hard to see how this logic applies to Kuntrell Jackson, who had no history of violent crime, who was serving as a lookout during the robbery, and who did not personally murder anyone. A 14-year-old boy in the presence of his peers will often do foolish and dangerous things, and the sort of behavior Jackson exhibited is far more likely to be indicative of transient adolescent immaturity than deep-seated depravity. It is harder to generate sympathy for Evan Miller, given the heinousness of his crime, but there are ways to punish him and protect the public without precluding the possibility of his rehabilitation. There is no scientific evidence that sentencing juveniles to long prison sentences deters other adolescents from committing crimes, because the same immaturity that leads teenagers to do impulsive and reckless things makes them unlikely to think far enough ahead to be deterred by the prospect of a serious punishment. More importantly, we are simply not good enough at predicting the behavior of a 14-year-old, even one who has committed a grisly, violent offense, to say with any certainty that he is beyond redemption. Rather than commit now to spending millions of dollars keeping Miller locked up for life, a parole board can evaluate Miller after he has matured into adulthood and decide whether and when it is appropriate to return him to the community. Ending life without parole for all juvenile offenders is the sensible thing to do. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Laurence Steinberg.","Laurence Steinberg: More than 2,500 serving life without parole for crimes done while juveniles .

"(CNN) -- Chelsea stunned titleholders Barcelona with a 1-0 victory in the first leg of their European Champions League semifinal on Wednesday . Ivory Coast international Didier Drogba scored the only goal of the game late in first-half injury time at a rain-swept Stamford Bridge in west London thanks to a rare mistake by Barcelona's Lionel Messi. After watching Spanish league leaders Real Madrid lose to Bayern Munich the night before, Barcelona had hoped to avoid any slip-ups as they attempted to defend their title. And the game appeared to be going their way as they dominated possession with Messi creating chances whenever he got on the ball. But the visitors were profligate in front of goal with Cesc Fabregas particularly guilty, the Spain international missing a hat-trick of clear-cut chances. As halftime approached Chelsea grew in confidence having weathered the initial storm and took a shock lead with the very last kick of the opening period. Messi's rare lapse in concentration allowed Brazilian midfielder Ramires to career down the left wing. With few options in front of him Ramires fired a low ball across the penalty box which eluded Barcelona's defense before somehow finding Drogba lurking at the back post. Barcelona goalkeeper Victor Valdes could do little but palm the striker's first-time shot into the back of the net. Despite Barcelona experiencing the rare feeling of being behind at halftime, it was Chelsea that grew more comfortable as the game progressed, snuffing out the Catalan club's attacks with increasing confidence. Yet deep in injury time Barcelona could have leveled the tie and score a crucial away goal, but substitute Pedro hit the post with his low curling shot and Sergio Busquets blazed the rebound over the bar. Chelsea -- controversially knocked out of the competition by a late Barcelona goal in 2009 on the same ground -- held on for a famous victory. ""It was a great result. When you play Barcelona you have to do a lot of defending, just try and limit their threat and be clinical with your chances,"" Chelsea's interim coach Roberto Di Matteo told British network ITV. And clinical they were. Drogba's goal turned out to be Chelsea's only shot on target in a game where Barcelona enjoyed the majority of possession: Chelsea completed 194 passes while Barcelona managed 782, almost four times as many. Yet the one statistic that counts is the score and for those that played in the last Chelsea-Barcelona Champions League semifinal in 2009 -- where Chelsea had five clear penalty claims turned down before an injury-time Andres Iniesta goal clinched their place in the final -- the victory was sweet revenge. ""I think we've learned, we've improved from three years ago. Now we're going to go there, have a go and try to qualify (for the final),"" said Drogba. Now attention turns to the second leg at Barcelona's Nou Camp. ""It's going to be tough there,"" admitted Drogba. ""They will have opportunities. We respect them. But we're not in awe of them.""","Chelsea beat Barcelona 1-0 in the Champions League semifinal first leg .

"(CNN) -- Two former high-ranking Chinese football officials have been handed 10-and-a-half-year jail terms for bribery in a widespread crackdown on corruption. China's Xinhua news agency reported that four former national team players and a number of match officials and team owners were also given prison sentences as a match-fixing case, which began over two years ago, drew to a close on Wednesday. Nan Yong, once the director of the Chinese Football Administrative Center, was handed the lengthy term at a court in the city of Tieling for accepting bribes in excess of 1.48 million yuan ($233,000) between 1999 and 2009. He was also fined 200,000 yuan ($32,000). Meanwhile in the city of Dandong, Xie Yalong, who previously held Nan's post, was given an identical sentence for accepting 1.36 million yuan in bribes, Xinhua reported. Xie was also fined 200,000 yuan, despite claiming in April that he had been tortured into giving a confession. Former national team midfielder Shen Si, who represented China 39 times between 1995 and 2002, was sentenced to six years, while fellow players Qi Hong, Jiang Jin and Li Ming have been handed five-and-a-half-year terms. Each of the four players were also fined $79,400. Chinese football has seen its profile boosted over the last 12 months, with a number of big-name stars joining the country's Super League. French striker Nicolas Anelka swapped English team Chelsea for Shanghai Shenhua in January, while former Argentina coach Sergio Batista was appointed by the club last month as replacement for Jean Tigana. Italy's World Cup winner Marcello Lippi is now coach of Guangzhou Evergrande, who have also recruited highly-paid players such as Argentine playmaker Dario Conca and Paraguay's Lucas Barrios.","Former top-level Chinese officials sentenced to over 10 years in jail .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Months after announcing the reintroduction of the low-cost Datsun brand -- to be assembled in Indonesia -- Nissan Motor Company on Tuesday moved its global headquarters for its luxury Infiniti line to Hong Kong to be closer to the red-hot Chinese luxury market. The common denominator between both moves: Building production and customer base outside the Japanese market, as export-driven companies have been hammered by the high value of the yen. Nissan produces about 20% of its cars in Japan, but CEO Carlos Ghosn would like to see that reduced. ""We're going to continue to do that (offshore production), obviously, because how can you compete with the yen at 80 yen to the dollar when the historic level has been 110 (yen to the dollar)?"" Ghosn told CNN's Andrew Stevens. ""We cannot compete against Korean makes or other competitors."" The yen hit record high of 75.93 yen to the U.S. dollar in October and remains stubbornly strong, hovering around the 79.45 yen to the dollar this week. ""I'm still not happy because of the strength of the yen. The strength of the yen is a penalty for Japan,"" Ghosn said. ""I don't think it's so much a penalty for companies, because large companies have the possibility to off-shore production."" Despite the ongoing travails in Europe, Ghosn predicts 2012 will be a record year for the automotive industry. ""Last year the industry produced and sold about 76 million cars -- we are on a trend this year to sell 79 million,"" he said. ""I think in 2012 we're going to have a recession in Europe, that's obvious,"" he added. ""Yes, Europe is going to be a problem ... but Japan's going to be better than last year,"" Ghosn said, as the world's third largest economy recovers from the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami, and the subsequent energy problems, as the nation's nuclear plants went off line following the Fukushima nuclear disaster. ""The U.S. is in recovery more (and will sell) 1 million additional cars compared to last year,"" Ghosn said. ""China, even though the growth has slowed down, there is still growth -- 5% to 6% growth of 17 million or 18 million cars sold there is still an additional million cars worth of growth. ""Brazil is growing well, India is growing well, Russia is growing well, the Middle East is coming back,"" he added. The move of Infiniti's headquarters to China is designed to help Nissan capture the luxury car market, a segment which has seen ""20% to 25% growth on a yearly basis,"" Ghosn said. Nissan announced earlier this year the return of the Datsun brand after 30 years. The company plans to introduce the low-cost car in several emerging markets in 2014. The Datsun brand first emerged in Japan in 1923 but was phased out in the 1980s as the company focused on mid-market buyers and its upscale Infiniti brand, launched in 1989. The company also plans to invest $400 million in Indonesia production, adding 3,300 jobs and producing 250,000 vehicles by 2014.","Nissan Motor Company moved its global headquarters for its luxury Infiniti line to Hong Kong .

"(CNN) -- Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi called for the rule of law, an end to ethnic conflict and strong democratic institutions in Myanmar on Thursday as she began a historic first trip to Europe after decades of house arrest. ""Am I overly ambitious?"" she asked, then smiled. ""Well, perhaps. I am ambitious."" The audience erupted in laughter and cheers as she declared that she was speaking not as a representative of government, then grinned and added: ""Not yet, anyway."" The democracy campaigner was speaking at the annual conference of the International Labour Organization, a U.N. agency. Worker and employer representatives, as well as government officials, attended the event. Answering questions after the speech, she said she had nothing to forgive the country's military rulers for. ""In some ways I don't think they did anything to me. They placed me under house arrest, but that gave me time to read,"" she said with a smile, adding: ""Sometimes when my schedule is very hectic, I look back with some nostalgia"" at nearly two decades of being confined to her home. She said her country, which is also known as Burma, needs ""reconciliation, not retribution,"" as it moves toward democracy. Suu Kyi was recently elected to parliament as her National League for Democracy won dozens of seats in by-elections. It remains a minority in parliament. Suu Kyi said she was ""concerned"" about ethnic and religious violence in the country after clashes between Buddhists and Muslims in the past week have left many dead or homeless. ""Of course I am concerned, as I think everybody else in Burma is,"" Suu Kyi said of the clashes in Rakhine state. ""We have said again and again rule of law is essential. ... Without rule of law, such communal strife will only continue,"" she warned, urging that the conflict be handled with delicacy, sensitivity and ""cooperation of all people concerned."" She also addressed ethnic violence in Kachin state, saying: ""A cease-fire is not enough. We have to have a political settlement if there is to be a lasting peace."" U.N. special envoy Vijay Nambiar, who returned from a visit to Rakhine on Thursday, said he had seen smoke rising from the remains of houses that had been burned. ""I'd like to say the worst is behind us,"" he told CNN's Kristie Lu Stout, but could not say that the unrest was over. ""Trauma, fear, insecurity"" will continue for some time, he warned, and said that reconciliation in the area will be ""a long haul."" Violent clashes between Buddhists and Muslims prompted the government of President Thein Sein to declare a state of emergency in Rakhine on Sunday, calling in the military to help impose order. The unrest in the western coastal area of Myanmar, which borders Bangladesh, has left 21 people dead and thousands seeking shelter in refugee camps, Myanmar state TV reported Tuesday evening. Suu Kyi said part of the problem was the ""porous border"" and ""fear that there will be illegal immigrants."" ""We need very clear and precise laws with regard to citizenship,"" she said. She urged International Labour Organization delegates to think of the people of her country as ""your own people, your own children,"" as she described the hopelessness many young people in Myanmar face. ""Restless, directionless youth agonize over the fruitlessness of their existence,"" she said. ""Please encourage your governments, your businesses, your workers to build the kind of society that will build the future of our country,"" she said in a departure from her prepared text. She called on them ""not just to look at investment opportunities"" in the mineral-rich nation, but ""to judge how much potential there is for good for the whole world. ... Our people have such spirit in them."" The International Labour Organization has for years pressured Myanmar to eradicate forced labor, which it says is widespread in the country. On Wednesday, the conference voted to lift restrictions on Myanmar's participation in the organization's activities, ending 13 years of isolation. During her trip, Suu Kyi will finally collect the Nobel Peace Prize that she was awarded in 1991, when she was under house arrest. She said Thursday that she had been too busy preparing for the trip to think about how she would feel when she received it. While in Europe, she is also scheduled to address both houses of the British Parliament, be the guest of honor at a concert in Dublin, Ireland, and celebrate her 67th birthday with family. The trip is only Suu Kyi's second abroad since she returned to Myanmar in 1988 to care for her dying mother, and comes close on the heels of her first trip outside the country earlier this year. A military coup in September 1988 put Gen. Saw Maung in power, setting off anti-government demonstrations and a crackdown that left hundreds dead. Suu Kyi -- whose husband, Michael Aris, remained in England -- became a leading activist and co-founder of an opposition group, the National League for Democracy. She was placed under house arrest for the first time the following July on charges of trying to divide the military. She spent much of the next two decades confined to her home by the ruling junta. When her party won the 1990 general election in a landslide vote, the military rulers -- in power since 1962 -- refused to let the National League for Democracy serve, nullifying the results. The military rulers have since loosened their grip on power, allowing a series of democratic reforms. Her house arrest ended in 2010, and she was able to travel around the country during her party's election campaign this year. On Saturday, about 21 years after she was awarded the prize, Suu Kyi is expected to finally deliver her Nobel lecture at the Oslo City Hall in Norway. Cities hosting her are well prepared for the fanfare. In Dublin, a giant banner hangs from Liberty Hall ahead of her scheduled Monday arrival. There, she will be the special guest at a concert, ""Electric Burma."" The event is organized by Art for Amnesty founder Bill Shipsey and features a range of entertainers and personalities, including Bono, Vanessa Redgrave, Bob Geldof, Angelique Kidjo and former Tiananmen Square student activist Wu'er Kaixi. Amnesty International, which has campaigned for Suu Kyi and other political prisoners in Myanmar during the past two decades, will award Suu Kyi its highest honor, the Ambassador of Conscience Award. Past recipients include Nelson Mandela and Vaclav Havel. Bono, who has long dedicated the song ""Walk On"" to Suu Kyi at U2 concerts to highlight her detention, will present the award.

"Athens, Greece (CNN) -- Greece appeared Tuesday to be heading toward having its first elected government in 222 days as the leaders of three political parties signaled that talks among them were going well. Representatives of the three parties, New Democracy, Pasok and the Democratic Party of the Left, held talks at Parliament in Athens Tuesday evening, state broadcaster ERT reported. They will meet again Wednesday afternoon, it said. Evangelos Venizelos, head of Pasok, which placed third in Sunday's election, said he believes a government could be formed by Wednesday afternoon, based on the current situation. In a televised address, he said he had proposed the formation of a national task force to renegotiate the terms of Greece's unpopular international bailout. Greeks went to the polls Sunday as the country struggles to get out of the political and financial mire that threatens to drag down Europe's common currency and spark a new global financial crisis. The center-right New Democracy party, which broadly favors Greece meeting international debt obligations, narrowly came in first place and has been holding talks on forming a coalition. It has three days from when the results were announced, on Monday afternoon, in which to form a government. The head of New Democracy said Monday he wants a wide coalition. ""There should be government of national salvation with as many parties as possible,"" Antonis Samaras told reporters. The leader of the Democratic Party of the Left, Fotis Kouvelis, held talks Tuesday with Venizelos and Monday with Samaras. Samaras called the discussions with the fourth-place party ""constructive."" The leftist party has supported bailouts from international lenders while seeking to renegotiate the terms. With almost all ballots counted, New Democracy had won nearly 30% of the vote, the Interior Ministry said, giving the party 129 seats in the country's 300-seat Parliament. Alexis Tsipras, the fiery leader of the leftist Syriza party, which came in second, met with Samaras but said Monday he would not back a coalition. ""History and the people will judge them by their results,"" Tsipras said of the parties backing the existing bailout deal with the creditors who are keeping Greece afloat. ""Shortly we will be vindicated."" What will Greek elections mean for the country's future? He said his party's nearly 27% showing had forced Greek leaders to realize the bailout is ""nonviable,"" and said Syriza would press as a member of the opposition for the bailouts to be scrapped. Syriza, which campaigned against the terms of the bailout, got 71 seats. Pasok, which long dominated Greek politics, won 33. Four smaller parties took fewer than two dozen seats each. The vote was widely seen as a referendum on whether Greece should remain tied to the euro, the currency used by 325 million people across 17 countries in Europe. The possibility of a ""no"" vote roiled world markets, with some analysts warning that the collapse of the euro would cost $1 trillion. Samaras said he would build a government of ""parties that believe in the nation's European orientation, that believe in the euro."" But he acknowledged that government budget cuts forced on the country by international lenders have caused suffering among Greeks. A wild election weekend for Greece, France and Egypt . The new government will have to make changes ""in order for the Greek people to escape the torturous reality of unemployment and unbelievable difficulties that every Greek family faces today,"" Samaras said after meeting with the president. International bailouts have kept Greece from defaulting in the face of an ongoing recession and low tax revenue, but lenders have demanded hugely unpopular government budget cuts in exchange. Some observers had predicted that efforts to renegotiate the bailout could lead to a run on Greek banks and deeper misery. The future of Europe: 3 scenarios . The country must identify additional budget cuts by the end of June to be considered compliant with the terms of its bailout. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Europe's powerful advocate for balancing budgets to build a strong basis for economic growth, had urged Greeks not to walk away from the international loan deals. ""We will stick to the agreements. That is the basis on which Europe will prosper,"" Merkel said Saturday. As economic crisis bites, Greece's children pay the price .

"(CNN) -- Authorities were tallying results Sunday in France's parliamentary elections, a key vote that could determine whether the country's new president can push through his agenda. Voters cast ballots across France to fill 577 parliamentary seats. If President Francois Hollande's Socialist Party wins a majority, it will be easier for him to garner support for his proposals. Hollande has been critical of the austerity policies central to European bailout deals for troubled economies there. To win the first round of voting, parliamentary candidates must receive a majority of votes cast in their districts as well as enough votes to represent 25% of all registered voters in their districts. If those requirements aren't met, candidates will head to a runoff vote, scheduled for June 17. Hollande became France's first Socialist president since FranÃ§ois Mitterrand left office in 1995 as he swept to election victory over the incumbent Sarkozy, one of the most America-friendly French presidents in decades . Hollande has unsettled investors with his criticism of the austerity policies central to European bailout deals for troubled economies such as Greece's and Ireland's.. The president, who was sworn into office in May, has chosen mostly moderates for his Cabinet, indicating an effort to build a broad coalition in the country. Last month, Hollande said he wants to balance the need to reduce the debts of European governments with efforts to stimulate growth.

"(CNN) -- The election in Greece of a pro-bailout party induced a huge sigh of relief well beyond Athens and plenty of press reaction that veered between cautious optimism and weary angst. Opinion pieces published before the vote made no mistake about the gravity of the weekend election. ""Europe's Future Hangs in the Balance,"" read the main headline in the English section of Germany's Der Spiegel Online. However, the German team's domination of Denmark to reach the quarter finals of Euro 2012 stole the top spot on its national homepage early Monday, ""Third game, third victory,"" the headline cried. With an election of its own on the weekend, France's Le Monde devoted its Monday morning homepage to a breakdown of a parliamentary vote tipped to solidify the majority of President Francois Hollande's Socialist Party. Greek New Democracy leader hails 'victory for all Europe' However, the Greek vote led the international sections of both German and French sites, and dominated headlines in the United Kingdom. Never known to underplay a headline, Britain's The Sun newspaper told it straight: ""Greece votes to keep the euro (just)... and save rest of Europe."" The Guardian pitched the win for the New Democracy party as a victory for the euro -- ""Voters give single currency a chance"" -- while at the same time the paper's economics editor argued that what was really needed was international action. ""The situation in the eurozone, and around the globe, was catastrophic before Sunday's second Greek election. The result changes little,"" Larry Elliott wrote. However, he added that anyone expecting G-20 members to come up with any effective coordinated response to the crisis ""obviously hasn't been paying attention."" ""Leaderless and at odds over what needs to be done, it has taken the G20 less than four years to become as redundant as the G8 it was supposed to replace,"" he said. G-20 leaders are meeting in Mexico Monday to debate possible solutions to the global economic turmoil. The homepage on Portugal's DiÃ¡rio de NotÃ­cias was dominated by Portugal's defeat of the Netherlands at Euro 2012, pushing the Greek vote further down the page. With its team relegated from the competition last week, the Irish Times focused on Greece's economic woes with an analysis piece pointing out that for Antonis Samaras, the leader of the New Democracy Party, the real challenge had just begun. ""It now falls to him to form a pro-bailout government with his former arch-foes in the Pasok socialist movement. Assuming this can be done in the coming days, any power-sharing deal between Samaras and Pasok leader Evangelos Venizelos is bound to come under sustained political pressure as they execute onerous austerity and reform measures in the face of grinding recession,"" it said. Britain's Mail Online injected a sense of urgency into power-sharing talks, ""Greek election stalemate creates race against time to form coalition government... as pro-bailout parties struggle to reach agreement that could save the euro, "" the headline screamed. The Huffington Post adopted a more relaxed tone, announcing that the election results had calmed fears of a Greek exit from the eurozone. Samaras also looked calm as he beamed from the front page of Italian daily Corriere Della Sera, which highlighted the relief which met the Greek election outcome. However the website's most-read story at the time of writing was about a rare image of a bee sting in motion. If only Greece's financial woes could be compared to the same. Greek vote lifts Asian markets . The Greek result also led papers in Spain. Under the headline ""Greece is not an exact science,"" El Pais, the country's leading daily, questioned why so much European relief has been expressed when the results were roughly the same as the first election in May. The threat of a Greek exit from the eurozone persisted, the article said. With the headline ""Samaras seeks 'national salvation' coalition,"" the main story on the English-language Athens News said the race was now on to form coalition to secure Greece's place in the eurozone. The article made mention of the ""unprecedented pressure tactics by the German and European political establishment in the run up to the elections."" ""German officials repeatedly declared that careful implementation of the bailout deal is the necessary condition for continued loans,"" it said. To prove the point, the website reproduced an open letter by German newspaper Bild which reminded Greek voters who was bankrolling their ATMs. ""Your ATMs continue to give you euros, only because we put them there, the Germans and the other nations that have the euro,"" the Bild letter read. It went on: ""Let's be clear on this: If the elections are won by parties that want to put an end to austerity and reform, breaching every agreement, we will stop paying."" Before the vote, Athens News issued its own appeal, urging to voters to give the far-right, anti-immigration party Golden Dawn ""the boot."" ""Greek society has taken a precarious turn, but it is still in the hands of the people to reverse this dangerous flirt with extremes and to make sure that groups like Golden Dawn - along with their deranged belief system - never set foot in parliament again,"" the editorial said. The paper's appeal appears to have gone unheeded. According to Interior Ministry figures, Golden Dawn won 18 seats -- or 7% of the vote -- a similar result to the first election in May.","Relief and cautious optimism expressed in European press after Greek vote .

"(CNN)  -- FIFA president Sepp Blatter has done a U-turn over the use of goal-line technology and apologized to the English and Mexican football associations for controversial refereeing decisions in their last 16 defeats. FIFA confirmed to CNN Tuesday that the next meeting of its International FA Board from July 21-22 in Wales would discuss technology but the use of video replays is ruled out. Frank Lampard's goal that never was as England trailed 2-1 just before halftime in their last 16 match against Germany, prompted widespread calls for the introduction of goal-line technology after his shot clearly crossed the line. In a later match on Sunday, Argentina's Carlos Tevez scored a hotly-disputed opening goal against Mexico in their 3-1 victory and television replays, which were broadcast on big screens at the ground, showed him to be offside. Blog: Just give us truth, introduce goal-line technology . Blatter told a media briefing in Johannesburg: ""It happened in 1966 and then 44 years later -- though it was not quite the same,"" the UK's Press Association reported. This was a reference to England's disputed third goal against West Germany in the 1966 World Cup final where arguments have raged for years over whether Geoff Hurst's shot crossed the line. ""I apologized to England and Mexico. ""The English said 'thank you and accepted that you can win some and you lose some, and the Mexicans bowed their head and accepted it."" But the Swiss is still set against the wider use of video technology where play might be stopped to allow a replay to be examined. ""The only principle we are going to bring back for discussion is goal-line technology,"" he said . Time for football to embrace technology ? ""Football is a game that never stops and the moment there was a discussion if the ball was in or out, or there was a goal-scoring opportunity, do we give a possibility to a team to call for replays once or twice like in tennis? ""For situations like the Mexico game you don't need technology."" Blatter added that the world governing body would launch a new drive to improve refereeing standards at the highest level later this year. ""We will come out with a new model in November on how to improve high level referees,"" he said. ""We will start with a new concept of how to improve match control. I cannot disclose more of what we are doing but something has to be changed.""","FIFA president Sepp Blatter says they will now consider use of goal-line technology .

"(EW.com) -- Well ... you can't say ""Cougar Town's"" cast and producers didn't try. The third season of ABC's comedy returned significantly lower in the ratings. In its new (and much tougher) time period, ""Cougar Town"" delivered 4.8 million viewers and a 1.8 adults 18-49 rating Tuesday night. This is a series low for the show (The CW's ""Ringer"" also had some particularly bad news, below). It's arguably unfair to compare ""Cougar Town"" to its own 3.4 premiere last year (from which it's down 47 percent). The show debuted in the fall on Wednesday nights with a lead-in from top-rated ""Modern Family."" Whereas last night's time slot in a few short months has been haunted by the short-lived ""Man Up"" (which premiered to a 2.4 rating) and ""Work It"" (2.0). ""Cougar Town's"" 1.8 rating is about average for this slot, but that's not great considering the two shows that mainly generated that number were cancelled. It's lead-in, ""Last Man Standing,"" had 7.6 million viewers and a 2.0 rating. The numbers follow the show's cast and creator Bill Lawrence traveling the country and guerrilla marketing the hell out of ""Cougar Town"" for the past month. Yesterday, Lawrence told us that he figured the show would return lower, but had hopes for the upcoming weeks. ""Here's what I really think will happen: I think the show will not premiere as high as people hope,"" Lawrence predicted to EW. ""And what I hope will happen is what always happened on ""Scrubs"" when they brought it back. The first week, the numbers are always lower than their predecessor....But what would happen then, as people became educated that the show was back on, each week it would be higher. The next week, the gap would be closed."" Also it should be noted that Valentine's Day is pretty lousy for shows in general. Overall TV usage was down 7.3 percent last night, according to Nielsen. Meanwhile ABC's ""The River"" (5.0 million, 1.7) is getting washed out, falling 29 percent its second week. At 10 p.m. ""Body of Proof"" (6.2 million, 1.2) was soft. No Valentine for Sarah Michelle Gellar: With only a repeat of ""Hart of Dixie"" for a lead-in, ""Ringer"" (1.1 million, 0.3) fell a stunning 40 percent from last week to a series low (and down 50 percent from its midseason return two weeks ago). A 0.3 rating is like ""Remodeled"" and ""H8R"" territory for The CW. Also Tuesday: CBS won the night with ""NCIS"" (3.9), ""NCIS: LA"" (3.2) and ""Unforgettable"" (2.3) -- all down between 3-7 percent.. Fox was second with ""Glee"" (2.8) down 15 percent, ""New Girl"" (3.2) down 9 percent and a steady ""Raising Hope"" (2.1).

"(CNN) -- A British woman could face the death penalty after being found with an estimated $2.6 million worth of cocaine in her luggage by Indonesian authorities. Lindsay June Sandiford, 55, was found to have blocks of cocaine weighing almost 4.8 kilograms in her suitcase after she arrived on the island of Bali on a Thai Airways flight earlier this month, government officials said. Sandiford, described by British media reports as a housewife, did not speak as she was paraded at a press conference Monday wearing a prison-issue orange t-shirt. Three other Britons -- one woman and two men -- and an Indian man are also being questioned, Bali police narcotics chief Mulyadi told reporters. They are accused of being part of an international syndicate, he said. Under Indonesia's extremely strict drugs laws, Sandiford could face execution, according to the head of Bali's Customs and Excise Agency monitoring division, Made Wijaya. ""The main reason is because narcotics can massively endanger the young and, thus, whoever is caught with drugs should be severely punished. If three people can consume one gram of cocaine, then this operation has potentially saved up to 14,000 lives,"" Wijaya told journalists at Monday's press conference. ""This is the biggest drug bust this year, and this is the first cocaine smuggled into Bali in the last three years."" The British Foreign Office said it is ""aware"" of the arrests and is ""ready to provide consular assistance."" Mulyadi -- who like many Indonesians uses one name -- revealed Sandiford was detained by customs officials on May 19 in the departure hall at Ngurah Rai International airport in Bali. Officials seized the black suitcase, which contained several packages containing cocaine. He said Sandiford claimed the suitcase was to be delivered to an unknown person as ordered by a British woman identified as RLD. According to Mulyadi, Sandiford then agreed to cooperate with Indonesian authorities and a meeting was set up with RLD on the island two days later. Police were then able to arrest RLD along with her British partner, identified as JAP, another British man known as PB, and an Indian man identified only as NA. The four were shown to reporters at Bali's police headquarters wearing balaclavas on Monday.

"Paris (CNN) -- New French President Francois Hollande tightened his grip on power Monday as the Interior Ministry confirmed that his Socialist party and its allies won an absolute majority in parliamentary elections Sunday. Hollande allies claimed 314 seats in the 577-member National Assembly -- the lower house of the French parliament -- according to early confirmed results by the French Interior Ministry. The results signal a clear French shift to the left, bolstering Hollande's position to push through an anti-austerity agenda after years of government budget cuts. Former President Nicolas Sarkozy's conservative UMP party experienced its biggest losses since 1981, winning just 229 seats. The far-right National Front won its first seats in parliament in 15 years, with two lawmakers elected, including the 22-year-old granddaughter of party founder Jean-Marie le Pen. Party leader Marine le Pen, however, suffered a shock defeat, losing the stronghold seat of HÃ©nin-Beaumont in northern France. The Europe Ecology and Greens party captured a surprise 17 seats. The outright victory of the Socialist party and its allies gives them complete control of both the Senate and the lower house, allowing Hollande to push through laws without the need to compromise. Hollande has already introduced some of his programs, which are centered on growth and spending, not austerity, reversing Sarkozy's policies. This includes a ""growth pact"": 120 billion euros worth of measures to stimulate growth in Europe, including developing renewable energies and biotechnologies. The proposal was presented to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other European leaders last week, the Journal du Dimanche newspaper reported Sunday. Other reforms include raising the minimum wage, a partial return to retirement at the age of 60 and increasing the value-added tax on goods sold in stores. Hollande has also vowed to slap a 75% levy on incomes higher than 1 million euros ($1.26 million) and raise taxes paid on the revenue of large fortunes. Discussion is already under way on education reforms, including a review of the French school year and increasing the stipend paid to help parents with school-age children. ""You have confirmed your will for change,"" French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault told French voters in a statement Sunday, saying that the government's ""objective is to reorient Europe toward growth and to preserve the eurozone from speculation."" More than 500 seats were decided in the latest round of balloting, according to French election officials, after a first round of voting proved inconclusive in those districts. The future of Europe: 3 scenarios . Hollande has unsettled investors with his criticism of the austerity policies central to European bailout deals for troubled economies such as Greece's and Ireland's. His policies have put him at odds with Germany's Merkel, who holds the purse strings for a large portion of the European Union's bailout efforts. Hollande became France's first Socialist president since FranÃ§ois Mitterrand left office in 1995 as he swept to election victory over the incumbent Sarkozy, one of the most U.S.-friendly French presidents in decades.

"(CNN) -- After following a cyber trail stemming from an ongoing investigation into possession of child pornography, federal officials in New Jersey said Thursday they now have custody of a Ukrainian man they believe is behind one of the largest international child porn distribution rings. The probe, which has led to the conviction of more than 560 Americans in 47 states, also brought about the arrest of Maksym Shynkarenko, 33, who is charged with founding and operating a website touting thousands of hardcore sexually explicit images and videos of boys and girls ranging from infants to teenagers, according to Rebekah Carmichael of the U.S. attorney's office in New Jersey. 18 rescued in child pornography raids, feds say . Shynkarenko has been slapped with numerous child exploitation charges, including conspiracy, transportation and shipment of child porn, advertising child porn, money laundering, and engaging in a child exploitation enterprise, according to a 32-count indictment. He pleaded not guilty to all charges Wednesday in the district court of New Jersey, according to court documents. ""This case itself is the one of the largest we have ever seen. In terms of significance it's enormous,"" said Andrew McLees, special agent in charge of Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations unit in Newark. ""This case is representative of the epidemic of this problem throughout the country and the globe."" He said the actions Shynkarenko is accused of ""created a market for exploitation, a market that will lead to more children being victimized."" Carmichael told CNN that Shynkarenko allegedly operated out of Ukraine but used servers all over the world, including in the United States, to house and disseminate the lewd images and videos. Shynkarenko, who is believed to have co-conspirators, according to Carmichael, was first arrested in January of 2009 in Thailand and had been fighting extradition to the United States until he was brought to Newark this past weekend. Special agents first uncovered the child pornography hub in 2005 through e-mails recovered from a New Jersey individual, one of the hundreds of people convicted of child-porn-related charges. According to a news release from the U.S. attorney's office, an undercover immigrations agent who subscribed to the site, dubbed ""Illegal.CP,"" received a disclaimer that warned of the websites' illegality, and encouraged users to claim their credit card information was stolen if questioned by police. U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman called bringing in Shynkarenko a milestone in an important fight against sexual predators. ""Distributors and consumers of child pornography create a market for sexual assaults on children, where the victimization of those children is refreshed with every download,"" Fishman said in the news release.

"(CNN) -- President Obama and Mitt Romney are set to make appearances beginning Thursday at a major gathering of Latino officials and activists in Florida, a moment that campaign-weary Democrats have awaited for weeks. Obama's strategists relish any chance to drive a wedge between Romney and Hispanic voters, and at the annual conference of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, or NALEO, the president is all-but-certain to paint Romney as beholden to anti-immigrant elements of his party's conservative base. It's an article of faith inside the Obama campaign's Chicago headquarters that the country's shifting demographics -- particularly growing Hispanic communities that lean Democratic in several swing states -- might be enough to put the election out of reach for Romney, no matter how sluggish the economy is. Few locales will test that theory in November better than the host city for the NALEO conference: Orlando, ground zero for Florida's rapidly expanding Latino population. How can Republicans attract voters other than old white men . ""The combination of demographics and the issue narrative in Orlando could be the difference between 29 electoral votes or not,"" said Steve Schale, who managed Obama's winning 2008 campaign in Florida. ""It's one of the areas where President Obama could grow from 2008."" Until Obama's victory, Orange County, home to Orlando and Disney World, had developed a well-earned reputation as one of Florida's premier battlegrounds. The county was decided by fewer than 6,000 votes in every presidential election going back to 1996. That all changed in 2008, when Obama carried the county by 85,000 votes against John McCain. In April, Schale, who maintains a blog devoted to Sunshine State political math that's closely followed by operatives in both parties, began combing through Census data and voter registration numbers in an effort to gauge whether Obama's Orlando blowout in 2008 was an aberration or the new normal in Florida campaigns. His findings, outlined in a post titled ""Orlando Rising,"" underscore the Obama campaign's demographics-as-destiny argument. Defining the Orlando metro area as Orange, Seminole and Osceola counties, Shale mapped out several unmistakably positive trends for Democrats: . â€¢ The Orlando area's population jumped by 436,000 people between 2000 and 2010, from 1.4 million residents to 1.85 million. African-Americans and Puerto Ricans, who tend to vote Democratic, accounted for more than half of that growth. â€¢ Between October 2006 and January 2012, the region added about 84,000 new voters and three quarters of those were African-American or Hispanic. The vast majority of new voters registered as Democrats. Over the same period, the share of the white vote in Orlando increased by only 7%. â€¢ In 1994, Republicans accounted for 50% of registered voters in the three sprawling counties surrounding Orlando. That number has now dropped to 33%. At the same time, 41% of Orlando voters are now Democrats, with the remainder not registering in either party. Will Obama's immigration initiative sway Latinos? Similar population changes are happening across Florida. ""The Democrats' lead among Hispanic voters has grown just in the last four years,"" said Mark Hugo Lopez, associate director of the Pew Hispanic Center. Latinos now comprise 13% of the Florida electorate, up from 11% in 2008. More Latinos are now registered as Democrats than as Republicans, a reversal from previous election cycles. At first glance, those shifts may seem modest. But in a huge state where the race may come down to a few thousand votes, any mathematical edge matters greatly. The fluid nature of the state's electorate is driven in large part by an influx of Puerto Ricans -- who are eligible vote the moment they arrive because of Puerto Rico's status as a U.S. territory -- along with growing Dominican, Colombian, Mexican and Venezuelan populations. Puerto Ricans are now the second largest Hispanic group in the state after Cuban-Americans, a Republican-leaning bloc that has seen its share of the statewide vote decline as other Latino communities grow at a faster clip. Strategists in both parties say Florida's decade-long Hispanic boom is most visible around Orlando, now the second-largest hub of Puerto Ricans in the country outside of New York. Neighborhoods like Kissimmee, Buenaventura Lakes and Meadow Woods, which hugs Orlando International Airport, have become hot spots for Obama campaign organizers. Among Florida's largest counties, Orange County's Hispanic population grew by 83% between 2000 and 2010, according to the Pew Hispanic Center. Navarette: Avoid assumptions about Latinos immigration status . That's faster than in Miami-Dade, Broward or Palm Beach County --- three huge and reliably Democratic counties in south Florida. Courting the Puerto Rican vote in Orlando is now an essential part of any Florida campaign itinerary, as vital as throwing back a shot of sugar-packed coffee in front of reporters at Versailles Restaurant in Miami's Little Havana. ""There is not a political visit in Orlando that doesn't include a stop at a Puerto Rican community center or gathering place,"" said Ana Navarro, a Republican fundraiser and strategist from Miami. The changing face of Orlando has profound implications for the state's political geography. In the modern era, Democrats have won statewide races with robust turnout in South Florida. Republicans usually rely on northern part of the state --- from Pensacola in the Panhandle to Jacksonville in the east -- and on places like Sarasota and Naples along the Gulf coast. And slicing through the central part of the state is Interstate 4, the highway connecting Tampa to Orlando. The ""I-4 Corridor"" has become a byword for the suburban midsection of the state where swing voters and transplants from the Midwest often decide elections. Opinion: What Latinos want from candidates? Respect . Tampa, the state's largest media market, continues to grow but retains much of its essential political character. Meanwhile, the ballooning Puerto Rican population just 80 miles up the road has Orlando looking, politically speaking, more and more like South Florida -- a potential Democratic stronghold in the heart of central Florida's political battlefield. Both campaigns know what's at stake. The Obama campaign and the Republican National Committee have opened multiple offices in Orlando and are engaged in Hispanic voter contact efforts. Underscoring the metro area's importance, the Orlando media market currently ranks second nationally in television ad spending from the campaigns and outside groups. Roughly $10 million worth of ads have aired in Orlando, including several Spanish-language ads from the Obama campaign. Obama campaign hands in Chicago and Florida are confident that the GOP's tough talk on immigration policy -- Romney has embraced elements of Arizona's tough immigration law and said he would veto the DREAM Act, for instance -- will push Florida's various Hispanic communities into the Democratic fold in November. Why older Latinos matter in election . Gabriela Domenzain, a spokeswoman for the Obama campaign, also said Romney's opposition to the Supreme Court confirmation of Sonia Sotomayor, a Puerto Rican, will hurt him in Orlando. ""Mitt Romney is on the wrong side of every issue important to Puerto Ricans,"" Domenzain said. ""The community cannot afford his insistence on repeating the failed economic policies that brought our economy to the brink of collapse, his belief that we should let foreclosures 'hit the bottom' or his commitment to slashing our health care and education."" Because of their citizenship status, Puerto Ricans are not directly affected by the president's decision last week to halt the deportation of young people who were brought to the country illegally. But Lynette Acosta, an Obama campaign co-chair and organizer in Orlando, said her fellow Puerto Ricans feel a kinship with other Hispanics affected by the law. ""We do gravitate to each other,"" Acosta told CNN. ""There's a sense a loyalty we feel to other Hispanics. At the same time, the campaign is doing well because that they haven't taken for granted that the Hispanic community is monolithic."" Republicans accuse the Obama campaign of playing identity politics. They point to the sputtering economy as the primary issue for voters, regardless of ethnicity. 'Sleeping giant' Latino vote yet to awaken . Issues like homelessness and foreclosures continue to be pressing matters in central Florida. ""Like in every other state, and like every other American, Hispanics in Florida are laser focused on the economy,"" said Bettina Inclan, the Republican National Committee's director of Hispanic outreach. ""This administration tries to do a lot of things so they don't have to talk about Obama's economic record."" GOP strategists also note that Puerto Ricans are more independent than most political observers give them credit for. Two Orlando-area Puerto Rican leaders, for instance, are running in the Republican primary in the state's newly drawn 9th Congressional District. Navarro, the Miami GOP fundraiser, said Jeb Bush, the state's former Republican governor, won successive statewide races with an aggressive Puerto Rican outreach effort in central Florida. ""The Puerto Ricans in Orlando tend to lean Democrat,"" Navarro said. ""But they can definitely swing Republican with the right candidate and the right message."" To this day, Bush consistently calls on the GOP to temper its harsh tone on immigration reform, often to little effect. One leading GOP strategist who has worked on several recent high-profile races in the state said Republicans have failed to grasp the political significance of the Florida's growing Hispanic population. ""If you tried to take this current Republican brand onward for a generation, we would suffer greatly in Hispanic communities and we would face serious problems across the state,"" said the strategist, who did not want to be identified criticizing his party. By the numbers: Latino voters .","Both Obama and Romney to speak to Latino officials and activists in Florida .

"(CNN) -- The United Nations said Monday that it has begun pulling staff out of a western state of Myanmar where the government has declared a state of emergency following clashes between Muslims and Buddhists. The inter-ethnic violence in the state of Rakhine has killed at least 17 people in just over a week, according to official media. President Thein Sein's office issued an order imposing a state of emergency in Rakhine on Sunday, saying ""riots and disturbances"" had spread, according to the New Light of Myanmar, a government-run newspaper. The United Nations is temporarily relocating its staff from the area on a voluntary basis for safety reasons, said Ashok Nigam, the organization's resident and humanitarian coordinator in Yangon, Myanmar's largest city. He said news reports and information from U.N. workers suggested that the unrest was making it impossible to continue operating in the region. Violence in the western coastal area of Myanmar, which borders Bangladesh, erupted after the police detained three Muslim men in relation to the rape and killing of a Buddhist woman late last month. Anger over the case fueled an attack by about 300 local people on a bus in the Taungup area of Rakhine that killed 10 Muslim passengers on June 3, according to the New Light of Myanmar. Clashes have multiplied since then, alarming the authorities. Rakhine is home to the Rohingya, an ethnic Muslim minority who say they have been persecuted by Myanmar's ruling military junta and have long sought refuge in other places. Over the years, Rohingya have fled by sea in small boats to other countries like Thailand and Malaysia. The United Nations has estimated that more than 200,000 Rohingya live in legal limbo in Bangladesh. ""What is currently happening in the Rakhine state is about putting grievances, hatred, and desire for revenge at the forefront, based on racial and religious grounds, and that's why anarchic actions are becoming widespread,"" Thein Sein, the president and former military official, said in a televised address Sunday. The unrest runs counter to the efforts of Thein Sein's administration to seek reconciliation with Myanmar's different ethnic groups and move the country toward more democratic governance. Western governments have rewarded progress in the country over the past year by easing economic sanctions. Violence in Rakhine on Friday killed seven people and wounded 17, according to the New Light of Myanmar. It said that 494 houses, 19 shops and one guesthouse were destroyed. The state of emergency means that defense forces will help maintain order in the state. The authorities also appear to be clamping down on the flow of information from Rakhine. The board of censors has told non-government publications in Myanmar that it will censor any articles on the situation in the western state that are not based on official reports, according to two people from different news media organizations who declined to be identified for fear of reprisals. Attempts to reach the Myanmar authorities for comment on the matter on Monday were unsuccessful. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Monday that the United States is concerned about the reported violence, and ""urges all parties to exercise restraint and immediately halt all attacks."" Praising recent reform efforts by the Myanmar's national government, Clinton said: ""The situation in Rakhine State underscores the critical need for mutual respect among all ethnic and religious groups and for serious efforts to achieve national reconciliation."" CNN's Sarita Harilela, Jethro Mullen and Licia Yee contributed to this report.","NEW: Authorities threaten to censor reporting by non-government media .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghans in government uniforms launched three attacks on U.S. and Afghan forces in a 24-hour period, including one that breached the perimeter of an American outpost near Kandahar, a Pentagon spokesman said Tuesday. The strikes made for what Capt. John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman, called a ""tough day"" around the southern city of Kandahar. A U.S. soldier was killed and several others were wounded in a shooting by gunmen in Afghan police uniforms Monday, and other disguised insurgents killed three Afghan police officers and wounded seven more in Kandahar, local authorities said Tuesday. Afghan insurgents strike U.S. outpost . The most recent attack wounded nine coalition troops at the American outpost dubbed Forward Operating Base Frontenac, in the Arghandab River valley, north of Kandahar. Kirby told reporters Tuesday that the attackers were dressed in the uniforms of the Afghan National Security Forces. The attackers ""were engaged very quickly by friendly forces inside,"" he said. ""There as a quick response force from a nearby combat outpost that responded almost immediately, and most of the casualties were evacuated to Kandahar."" Two U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said at least eight insurgents carried out the attack. Seven of them were killed and the sole survivor was wounded, they said. The area has been the scene of extensive insurgent activity in recent years. Neither official could explain how the breach occurred, but initial reports indicate officials believe the insurgents might have had help from Afghan security personnel. In Afghanistan, mother bravely campaigns for president . Uniformed Afghans -- either insurgents in disguise or members of the country's police or military -- have been behind numerous killings of U.S. and NATO troops this year. The incidents have fueled mutual distrust between Afghan and allied forces in the now-decade-old conflict. Tuesday's clash followed an incident Monday in which three gunmen in Afghan police uniforms fired on American troops in another location in southern Afghanistan, killing one and wounding several others. Kirby said that incident ""appears to be what we consider a green-on-blue, an insider threat attack."" U.S. forces launched a manhunt for the attackers late Monday, but they remained at large, he said. And a gun battle erupted at a Kandahar police station early Tuesday morning when four insurgents wearing police uniforms tried to enter the facility, according to the office of the Kandahar governor. Police officers confronted them and a gun battle ensued, leaving the four attackers dead, the governor's office said. All three strikes were located around Kandahar, the birthplace of the Taliban militia that once ruled most of Afghanistan. But beyond geography, ""It's just too soon to say with any certainty the degree to which any of these are connected,"" Kirby said.

"(CNN) -- Greece coach Fernando Santos has urged his players to focus on football rather than the political tensions surrounding his side's Euro 2012 quarterfinal against Germany in Gdansk Friday. Both nations are at the heart of the Eurozone debt crisis and German chancellor Angela Merkel is an unpopular figure in Greece over her calls to maintain tough austerity measures in return for financial aid from her country. ""Look, the situation has affected us,"" Santos told CNN. ""The players have family, they have friends, and they worry about what is going on. I would say Greece is going through more than just a political or economic crisis. There is a social crisis with a lot of unemployment. The players are human beings and they feel that. ""What I have asked them to do is to try to forget about that when they play and to focus just on football to show they are real fighters."" When Greece unexpectedly reached the last eight with a 1-0 win over Russia, a day before key elections which saw a narrow victory for pro-Euro party New Democracy, Greek newspapers were quick to link Friday's game with the country's economic turmoil and strained relations with Germany. ""This is how your debtors qualify, Angela get ready,"" ran the headline in Sport Day. ""Bring us Merkel!"" said Goal News. But Santos told CNN that his players had to keep their emotions in check against Germany. ""As far as the players are concerned, they can have extra motivation and more passion in this game against Germany but they can't lose focus,"" he said. ""We need to think during this game, and if we are led just by our hearts and our emotions, we will be in trouble."" German coach Joachim Low is also trying to keep politics out of the last-eight clash as his side bid to bag a first major trophy since Euro '96. ""Angela Merkel and the national team are on very good terms,"" Low told a press conference earlier this week. ""We have reached an agreement where she doesn't interfere with my tactical instructions and, in return, I don't deal with her political agenda. ""As far as we are concerned, we are approaching a normal football contest and that is the end of it."" Euro 2004 success . Santos' men have already shown the fighting qualities which marked Greece's surprise triumph at Euro 2004, snatching an unlikely qualification after winning a single point in their opening two games. But the 57-year-old Portuguese, who replaced German coach Otto Rehhagel in 2010, is not surprised by the team's passage to the knockout stages. ""I always believed we could make it out of the group,"" Santos said. ""Even after our first two games didn't go well I still had faith because I know this team very well and the players always do well in situations of adversity."" But can they beat one of the favorites for the competition and go on to repeat that 2004 success? ""We all believe we can beat Germany, why not? We have our weapons as well and if we use them to our advantage we can make our dream of advancing to the next stage come true,"" he said. ""Sometimes history can repeat itself. We have to keep dreaming and believing we can make history repeat itself."" Germany favorites . One of the major obstacles to Greece progressing is the suspension of their captain and key midfielder Giorgos Karagounis, who scored the only goal of the match against Russia. Santos admits his absence Friday is a ""big blow."" But he added: ""We can't forget our strength is in our group not just on one player, so we will find a way to be successful without him."" Germany go into the match in the Polish port city as clear favorites, having won the so-called ""Group of Death"" with a 100% record. But they needed a late winner to beat Denmark 2-1, and Low was unhappy with some aspects of their performance. ""We left a few enormous gaps in midfield for the opponent to exploit and I didn't like that. The solutions are just as clear as the challenges.""","Greece play Germany in quarterfinals of Euro 2012 in Gdansk, Friday .

"LONDON, England  -- Models younger than 16 should be banned from catwalks during London Fashion Week over fears that some girls are developing eating disorders because of their work in the industry, fashion experts have recommended. British model Lily Cole, now 19, shot to fame in 2003 at the age of 15. She attracted attention for her thin build. The new rules were proposed after a panel of experts in the UK began investigating health problems among models in the wake of the size zero debate. However, the guidelines fall short of banning stick-thin girls from the catwalk. The independent Model Health Inquiry said Wednesday in its interim report into models' working conditions that a greater level of protection for 17- and 18 year-olds was needed, including chaperoning at shows. The panel said models under 16 were particularly vulnerable. It mentioned the risk of children being sexually exploited when they were made to represent adult women. It also called for a rigorous scientific study into the prevalence of eating disorders among fashion models and outlined a positive case for setting up a union for the modeling profession. During the inquiry, panel members heard from many models who described the fear of not being selected for work because they were not thin enough, according to Panel chairwoman Baroness Kingsmill, the UK's Press Associated reported. ""The panel has set out an approach designed to protect vulnerable young workers in an industry which appears to be glamorous but which has hidden risks and that for all practical purposes is largely unregulated and unmonitored,"" Kingsmill said. ""During our investigations members of the panel became increasingly concerned as we heard more details about the working conditions faced by many models and the vulnerability of young women working in an unregulated and scarcely-monitored work environment. ""We have been given startling medical evidence about the prevalence and impact of eating disorders in certain high-risk industries. Working conditions for models are far from transparent and there is a worrying lack of information about the overall profession."" The panel ruled out weighing all models because it had been ineffective in other countries, PA said. However, they want more information on whether a minimum body mass index (BMI) requirement of 18.5 should be introduced for London Fashion Week models. This approach has already been adopted by Madrid fashion week. It called on the British Fashion Council which owns and runs London Fashion Week to develop new best-practice standards for model agencies. After gathering responses to its interim report, the inquiry will publish its final report in September, along with a final set of recommendations, ahead of the next London Fashion Week. Agencies should arrange medical checks including screening for eating disorders when they first put a model on their books. This should be followed by annual check-ups, the panel said. The College of Psychiatrists told the panel that models with a BMI of below 18.5 -- which means they are underweight -- should be banned from the catwalk, but other respondents said BMI did not help identify the eating disorder bulimia nervosa. Last year, models with a BMI of less than 18 were banned from taking part in Madrid Fashion Week. Doctors use the index, which is a ratio of height to weight, to calculate the healthy size for an individual. Recent controversy over skinny models was sparked in August 2006, when Uruguayan model Luisel Ramos, 22, died of heart failure after not eating for several days. Her death was followed in November by that of Ana Carolina Reston, a Brazilian model who suffered from anorexia. The debate about the U.S. size zero was caused by celebrities dieting down to the super-thin size. E-mail to a friend .","Panel: Under 16s too vulnerable to work as models, recommends catwalk ban .

"(CNN) -- Bombers killed at least seven people at a pro-regime Syrian satellite channel Wednesday, the government said, as world diplomats were making another try at ending the violence raging across the country. ""Terrorists planted explosive devices"" in the headquarters of al-Ikhbaria, located near Damascus, killing three journalists and four security guards, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported. The attackers also ransacked and destroyed studios, the news outlet said. ""The massacre won't go unpunished,"" Information Minister Amre al-Zoubi said. The regime of President Bashar al-Assad has accused foreign media of conspiring against the country and said al-Ikhbaria works to counter the ""sinister campaign."" But observers say al-Ikhbaria is a mouthpiece for the government's propaganda, refusing to acknowledge the regime's violence on dissidents seeking freedom. The bombing comes a day after al-Assad said his restive country is in a ""state of war"" and as United Nations and Arab League envoy Kofi Annan scheduled a meeting of top diplomats Saturday in Geneva, Switzerland, to tackle the conflict. Turkey hardens military position after Syria downs jet . After more than 15 months, unrest in the Arab nation shows no sign of abating. Internationally, tension rose last week after Syria shot down a Turkish jet, an act deplored by NATO and many Western nations. At least 83 people were killed in nationwide violence Wednesday, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. The diplomats want to address an environment in which, according to a U.N. report published Wednesday, new rebel groups are emerging and fighters are making strides and gaining potency. ""The situation on the ground has dramatically changed in the last three months as the hostilities by anti-government armed groups each day take on more clearly the contours of an insurrection,"" said the report, issued by the Independent Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic. ""As a result of the estimated flow of new weapons and ammunitions, both to the government forces and to the anti-government armed groups, the situation risks becoming more aggravated in the coming months. The international community must not fail to implement a concerted effort to put an end to the violence."" The United Nations and other entities tracking the conflict in Syria noted the increasing clout of anti-government forces in past months. The report cites this trend, saying rebel ""operations in some locations are improving in efficiency and organization."" The opposition is growing across Syria and fighting government forces on several fronts. The groups are engaging with government forces in ""direct combat"" and are attacking military and security facilities, the report said. ""Their increasing capacity to access and make use of available weapons has been demonstrated in recent weeks,"" the report said. It said rebels haven't gotten ""new or more sophisticated weaponry."" But they are using improvised explosive devices ""against army and security convoys, patrols and facilities such as military buildings and checkpoints."" ""In at least one case, this has led to collateral damage among civilians and their properties. According to reliable sources, anti-government armed groups have also been using IEDs in assassinations, targeting government officials and individuals from the army and security forces."" The report said rebel forces ""have effectively challenged"" the regime's authority in Damascus, Homs, Hama, Idlib and Aleppo provinces. For example, it said, the government forces' control of the country's borders has been regularly undermined, and cross-border movements of refugees as well as of anti-government fighters appear to be more frequent and fluid. Can Turkey force U.S. and other NATO countries to attack Syria? Burhan Ghalioun, former president of the opposition Syrian National Council based in Turkey, said he slipped over the border into Syria on a brief visit to Idlib province, and described rebel resolve and bravery amid a moonscape of destruction. ""The spirits of the fighters are very, very high,"" he told CNN. ""They are ready to die for their freedom. The major problem that the fighters are facing is the nonstop bombardment by planes and tanks. This is making the battle difficult as the rebels don't have heavy weapons. Many cities and towns are already liberated. I was driven around Idlib in a car with a banner saying 'The Free Syrian Army.' "" Many observers say the rebel fighting forces have been too autonomous and have lacked central command. Ghalioun said they are ""very united"" and ""cooperating among themselves."" ""Despite that, there is no serious arming; the rebels are gathering arms from the attacks and battles they do with the regime forces,"" he said. ""They are so organized on the ground, they have formed committees to help each other: medical, social, political, etc. I am simply amazed."" The Commission of Inquiry is investigating the killings last month of more than 100 people in the Houla region -- where most of those slain were reportedly women and children -- but has been limited because it hasn't gotten access to the country. It has had to conduct interviews with people by telephone or in the countries to which they fled. So far, it said, it can't rule out, ""with the available evidence,"" the possibility that perpetrators include pro-government militias, rebels or foreign groups. But, it said, ""forces loyal to the government may have been responsible for many of the deaths."" Many observers believe the Houla killings may have resulted from sectarian violence. Houla comprises three towns with a majority Sunni population. They are ringed by Shiite and Alawite villages. Most Syrians are Sunni, and many of them support the opposition. The government is dominated by Alawites, an offshoot of Shiism. ""Where previously victims were targeted on the basis of their being pro- or anti-government, the (Commission of Inquiry) has recorded a growing number of incidents where victims appear to have been targeted because of their religious affiliation,"" the report said, describing conditions across Syria. The commission said special envoy Annan's peace initiative ""offers the best framework for a resolution of the conflict,"" and Annan's planned Saturday meeting of the Action Group for Syria will work on steps to implement his six-point peace initiative. Annan said Wednesday he invited the top diplomats of the five permanent members of the Security Council -- China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States -- and Turkey. Envoys from the United Nations, European Union, and Arab League also were invited. The Action Group for Syria should ""agree on guidelines and principles for a Syrian-led political transition that meets the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people; and agree on actions that will make these objectives a reality on the ground,"" Annan said. ""I look forward to a productive meeting this weekend, where we can all agree on concrete actions to end the cycle of violence and bring peace and stability to the Syrian people."" U.S. sees stalemate in Syrian fighting . U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton plans to attend the meeting. Speaking in Helsinki, Finland, she said that, if participants can meet on the basis of laying out a road map to a political transition in Syria, ""then a meeting makes a lot of sense"" and ""could be a turning point."" A transition road map backed by Russia and China, which have blocked tough previous attempts by the Security Council to act against Syria, would send a strong message to the al-Assad regime, she said. Annan had wanted to invite Iran to the meeting, but the United States opposed that, noting Tehran's support for al-Assad's forces. The United Nations estimates more than 10,000 people have been killed since the Syrian crisis began in March 2011. Opposition activists say the death toll has exceeded 15,000, most of them civilians. About 1.5 million Syrians ""are in need of urgent humanitarian assistance,"" said Jean-Marie Guehenno, U.N.-Arab League deputy envoy to Syria.

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- North Korea has reacted angrily to the use of its flag during live-fire drills by South Korea and the United States, calling it ""a grave provocative act."" The comments from Pyongyang on Sunday came after the allies held military drills last week less than 50 kilometers (30 miles) away from the North Korean border, involving more than 2,000 military personnel. An unidentified North Korean foreign ministry spokesman accused South Korea and the United States of firing ""live bullets and shells"" at the flag, according to a report by the state-run Korean Central News Agency. The act was ""the most vivid expression of their hostile policy,"" the spokesman said. The North Korean flag was put on an elevated hill but was not directly used as a target during the exercises, an official for the South Korean Defense Ministry said, declining to be identified. ""It was used only as a symbol of North Korean territory and the drill was a defensive one,"" he added. More than 230 military weapons were used in the U.S.-South Korean exercises on Tuesday and Friday last week, including newly upgraded attack helicopters and artillery. The use of the flag is clearly a provocation for North Korean officials, who will take it as an insult to their identity and dignity, said Choi Jong-kun, a professor at Yonsei University. North Korea slams joint drill among U.S., Japan and South Korea . ""They are not likely to respond physically, but they will definitely capitalize this opportunity for the future,"" he added. Pyongyang nonetheless used the military drills as an opportunity to remind Seoul and Washington of its nuclear weapons program. The North ""will further bolster up its nuclear deterrent for self-defence as long as the U.S., the world's biggest nuclear weapons state, persists in its hostile policy,"" KCNA cited the Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying. South Korea said last month that satellite images suggested that North Korea was ready to carry out a fresh nuclear test but that the reclusive state was awaiting a ""political decision"" on whether or not to go ahead. Many analysts assume an atomic test by North Korea is just a matter of time following the failure of a controversial rocket launch in April. Two previous rocket launches in 2006 and 2009 were followed weeks or months later by nuclear tests. The two Koreas are still technically at war since the 1950-53 conflict that left the Korean Peninsula divided along a heavily militarized border. The United States has tens of thousands of troops stationed in South Korea. The live-fire drills were part of a series of military exercises last week, including a trilateral naval drill between the United States, South Korea and Japan. Clinton says young North Korean leader 'has a choice'","The United States and South Korea hold a joint military exercises .

"Washington (CNN) -- Rep. Charlie Rangel's journey from Harlem's favorite son to politically embattled Washington insider to campaign victor is a saga that spans more than 40 years and is the type of tale that only seems possible in the soap opera-like world of inside the Beltway politics. Rangel's comeback tale is as much a testament to his political savvy as it is the resiliency of the area he represents. ""One of the great things about Charlie Rangel is his longevity. And there are lots of people who see his ability to stay on the game as representative of Harlem,"" said Mark Anthony Neal, an African-American studies professor at Duke University and author of ""New Black Man: Rethinking Black Masculinity."" ""The idea of Harlem always being on the ropes and being able to bounce back, that's been the story of Rangel's political career."" Rangel claimed victory Tuesday in the Democratic primary to represent a redrawn, largely Latino New York district, capping a tale of political survival for the lawmaker, whose House colleagues censured him for ethics violations after his re-election to his 21st term in 2010. On Tuesday night, he offered relieved thanks to supporters at his campaign headquarters in New York after clinching the five-way race for the nomination in his Harlem-area district. The new 13th Congressional District stretches from East Harlem to the northwest Bronx. ""They've had enough trust in me, they say, 'Rangel, we think you can do it. We want you on our team in the Bronx,' "" he said. ""And so I can tell everybody who don't know this district or the Bronx, when I'm walking the streets of the Bronx, I feel my district and the blood and the minds and the ambitions and the things that people want for their children."" Rangel netted about 45% of the vote, compared with his closest rival, New York state Sen. Adriano Espaillat, who got about 40% in the latest count. Rangel received 80% of the vote in the 2010 primary. Espaillat, 57, who would have been the first Dominican-American to serve in the House, used his background to court Latino votes and take aim at the 82-year-old Rangel over his long tenure in Washington and his ethics abuses. On Tuesday, Espaillat sent a note to supporters, thanking them and conceding the race. ""Though we didn't make it to the finish line tonight, the values we fought for and the communities we seek to improve will continue to light a fire in us,"" he said. ""The truth is, even in coming a bit short, we made history."" Rangel knows about fighting. He grew up in poverty, was abandoned by his Puerto Rican father and lived with an aunt and uncle in the Bronx. The high school dropout enlisted in the Army and was awarded the Bronze Star for valor in the Korean War after he helped rescue 40 men trapped behind Chinese lines. After the war, he used the GI Bill of Rights to earn a degree from New York University and a law degree from St. John's University. He served as an assistant U.S. attorney before being elected to the New York State Assembly in 1966. Rangel began his long run in the U.S. House in 1970 when he defeated another flamboyant and beloved longtime Harlem politician, Rep. Adam Clayton Powell Jr., in the Democratic primary. Years later, he defeated Powell's son in the 2010 Democratic primary. But in his most recent contest, the congressman faced changing demographics and a redrawn district with more Latino-Americans than African-Americans, a shift that helped Espaillat. Though he now represents a district that is more heavily Latino, the African-American community's traditionally higher voter turnout rates helped Rangel win, said David Wasserman, editor of House races for the Cook Political Report. ""His 2010 primary was more of a referendum on ethics. This was more a test of ethnic strength and a referendum on Rangel's fitness for office,"" Wasserman said. ""He delivered a more tenacious campaign closer to Election Day, and he was able to count on very loyal support to win a low-turnout primary."" Rangel, one-time chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, was censured by the lower chamber in 2010 after he was found guilty of ethics violations. He failed to pay income taxes for a rental unit in the Dominican Republic, filed misleading financial disclosure reports and set up his campaign office in a building where he lives, among other breaches. Pundits predicted an end to his political career at the time, pointing to previous ethics problems and the potential of redistricting after the 2010 census. ""The power of incumbency was on full display when Rep. Charlie Rangel won his primary on Tuesday,"" said Thomas Schatz, president of Citizens Against Government Waste, a watchdog group. ""While Congress' rating is in the single digits and several incumbents have lost primaries around the country, Rep. Rangel is still extremely popular in Harlem. His re-election is both a testament to his longevity and a reflection of his constituents, who clearly don't seem to mind his ethical lapses. "" Still, the dapper lawmaker has a core of ardent supporters. ""He is a consummate public servant, and public service is not easy whenever your life is open for constant scrutiny and everything you do is under a microscope,"" said New York state Assemblyman Keith L.T. Wright, a co-chairman of the state Democratic Party. ""He's from Harlem. We've done nothing but have to fight for whatever we have to achieve."" In Congress, Rangel was among the leading voices in the fight against drug trafficking, pushed for low-income housing tax credits and authored legislation to support urban communities. He became the first African-American chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee after Democrats won control of the House in 2006. He also helped create the Congressional Black Caucus, an organization that represents African-American members of Congress. Despite the new district lines and some recent health problems, Rangel fought hard to keep his seat, squaring off with his opponents in debates and taking them on during campaign stops. ""One of my opponents said that I got the idea that I'm the only person that can do the job, that I'm the smartest person in the world and no one is smart enough to do it. I said, 'That's not so. I'm just smarter than you,' "" Rangel said last week, according to CNN affiliate WCBS-TV. Rangel and Espaillat faced fellow Democrats Joyce Johnson, a business executive; former Rangel intern Craig Schley; and former Bill Clinton aide Clyde Williams to win control of the 13th Congressional District. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo endorsed Rangel on Friday, citing his decades of service and ability to ""bring things back to the state of New York."" However, New York's three major daily newspapers each endorsed a different one of Rangel's opponents, prompting a fierce defense from the New York City native. And on Tuesday, though a bit chastened by his tough political slog, he offered a bit of trademark spark. ""If (the newspaper editorial boards) didn't think, after 42 years, that I was the best qualified, I promise them in the next two years, they'll have no question of the fact that you elected the best."" CNN's Gabriella Schwarz and Alan Silverleib contributed to this report.","Charlie Rangel's ability to fight off the ropes embodies area he represents, professor says .

"(CNN) -- Former world No.1 Ana Ivanovic is hoping to lead Serbia to a historic first Fed Cup final in Moscow this weekend. The Serbian team, who have never reached the last four until this season, will face a Russian side who have won the tournament four times. But, crucially, they will be without top stars Maria Sharapova and Vera Zvonareva. Armed with a stellar line-up including Ivanovic and fellow former world No.1 Jelena Jankovic, the Serbs are hoping to deliver the biggest upset of the tournament to injury-hit Russia. ""For all of us and for our country it means a lot,"" team captain Dejan Vranes said at the draw on Thursday. ""It's the first time (in the semifinals) after many years. We started this journey five years ago in the Europe/Africa Group 1 in Plovdiv and after five years we're finally in the semifinals. Our plan is just to fight until the last point -- we'll see what happens."" Serbia, who have been beaten by Russia in their last three Fed Cup meetings, is in its strongest position yet to finally claim a victory. Ivanovic has suffered a slump in form since winning the 2008 French Open, but has shown encouraging signs this year rising seven places in the rankings to 15th. The 24-year-old reached the fourth-round of the Australian Open in January and the semifinal in Indian Wells in March. ""We have had a good team for a while but we never seem to come together and actually go for it,"" she said on the official Fed Cup website. ""This is the first time we're in the semifinals so it's very thrilling of course. It makes it that much harder with the Olympics of course and everything else this year and it seems like a lot of things are going on. ""The semifinal is just one step from the final and maybe a title -- something I would love to have next to my name."" Russia should have been the formidable favourite in the historic showdown, taking the title four times in the last decade. In the absence of world No.2 Sharapova and 10th-ranked Zvonareva, Russian captain Shamil Tarpishchev has turned to two-time grand slam champion Svetlana Kuznetsova, as well as Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, Maria Kirilenko and Elena Vesnina. In the other semifinal reigning champions the Czech Republic take on three-time winners Italy. World No. 3 Petra Kvitova is expected to lead the home side in Ostrava as she bounces back from illness and injury which have plagued her for the past two months. The 2011 Wimbledon champion will be joined by 23rd-ranked Lucie Safarova, and doubles partners Andrea Hlavackova and Lucie Hradecka. The Italians, led by 2010 French Open champion Francesca Schiavore and world No.22 Flavia Pennetta have won four of their last seven meetings.","Serbia to face Russia in their first ever Fed Cup semifinal .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- They either obsequiously kowtow to your every demand, or mutter sarcastic remarks after reasonable requests like picking up your newly-heeled brogues or collected your Pomeranian from the dog salon -- so, really, who needs a real butler or even a personal assistant anymore when you can now outsource your personal life? Don't call me Jeeves: Outsourced personal assistants can save time and hassle. For the wealthy, personal concierge services are not new, but outsourced personal assistant services are booming and becoming the latest addition not only to ""cash-rich, time-poor"" executives, but ordinary people who just want some help with life's tedious tasks. They may not be able to physically pick up your dry cleaning, but they can arrange to have it delivered, all via the click of a mouse or a quick phone call to a ""virtual assistant"" in a call center in Asia. Outsourcing the chores of work or everyday life is the natural extension of the globalization of consumer services. Companies catering for our personal lives are using the same model used by IT businesses that have utilized cheaper, skilled Asian workforces to take care of the service end of their operations. GetFriday and Ask Sunday are two companies catering for this growing demand and are attracting more that just bankers and corporate lawyers who are joined at the hip to their PDAs. For $15 an hour, customers with GetFriday -- an Indian company based in Bangalore -- are paired with a personal assistant. The customer can call or email their overseas assistant, calling them by their first name (for that personal touch) and request almost anything, from helping to draft legal documents to more everyday chores such as paying bills. Outsourced consumer services have even spread to more fundamental areas of life. TutorVista -- founded by Krishnan Ganesh, an Indian entrepreneur who was one of the first people to pioneer off-shore call centers -- offers personal tutoring to high school and college students through real-time online lessons taught by PhD-educated tutors in India, Singapore and Hong Kong. Avinash Samudrala, co-founder of Ask Sunday, says that they have clients from Sydney to Switzerland and research teams in cities across Asia as well as the U.S. and Canada who scour the Internet to meet any requirement. Typically each request will take 20 minutes to complete with customers receiving a call or e-mail to confirm it has been completed. ""We'll try and do everything that is asked of us, but we don't do things that we consider to be illegal,"" Samudrala told CNN. Ask Sunday can count housewives and salesmen among their customers, but the majority of people signing up are still the BlackBerry addicted bankers, accountants and corporate lawyers. Some may feel uneasy about leaving so much personal information, such as credit card details, passport numbers and home address, with a company. Hamaad, a Wall Street banker, uses Ask Sunday's service three to four times a week and has no problem giving up his personal details. ""I asked them to buy me a pair of shoes from a Web site a few weeks ago, so they even have my shoe-size now, but I'm not worried about online security. It's worth it in saving the time and legwork that some tasks take up."" While freeing us from the daily minutiae, these remote personal assistants might also be making some parts of our lives more impersonal as some people are happy to outsource more private areas of their lives. ""We have looked up dates for people on Match.com and Craigslist. One investment banker who was up against it with work took the moment he had between a flight from New York to Europe to ask us to wish a friend of his a happy birthday,"" said Samudrala. GetFriday list motivational calls to clients to encourage them to exercise among the stranger things asked of them, but the company's service has been so popular that it has had to suspend new membership for the moment as a growing number of clients threaten to overwhelm the research assistants.

"(CNN) -- Caroline Wozniacki made it 13 straight wins in her home tournament in Copenhagen on Friday the 13th as she dispatched French hope Alize Cornet 6-0 6-3. The former world number one is bidding for her third straight title on the hard courts of the Farum Arena and has now won 19 straight sets without reply, dating back to the 2010 semifinals. The Danish top seed will take on Petra Martic Saturday for a place in the final. ""I played well. I got a lot of first serves in and I didnÂ´t make any unforced errors, which always helps, of course,"" Wozniacki told the official WTA website. Martic saw off Bojana Jovanovski 6-4 4-6 6-3 to make the semifinals in Copenhagen for the second year in a row. Former top-ranked Jelena Jankovic continued her improved form, having gone into the event off the back of four straight defeats. The Serbian third seed beat Kaia Kanepi 4-6 6-1 6-3 to reach her third semifinal of the year. She will play second seed Angelique Kerber, who was taken to three sets before beating fellow German Mona Barthel. Kerber trailed 5-2 and saved two match points before winning 6-2 0-6 7-5. ""It was a very tough match. Mona played unbelievable tennis, especially in the second, where I actually had no chance,"" said Kerber.

"(Rolling Stone) -- There's an idea at play in this rampant idiocy, as well as considerable risk. In trying to introduce a new generation to the slapstick art of the Three Stooges, directors and co-writers Bobby and Peter Farrelly do it the hard way. Instead of a standard biopic that might explain how a 1930's vaudeville act called the Three Stooges -- brothers Moe and Curly Howard and their friend Larry Fine -- made their Hollywood mark with nearly 200 short films that featured the boys slapping, poking and punching each other senseless, the Farrellys decided to hit the 2012 multiplex with a trio of Stooges shorts set in the present. Kids know the short clips on ""Funny or Die,"" don't they, even if they never caught the Stooges online or DVD. And besides, audiences with short attention spans are bigger than ever. And if the Farrellys couldn't cast their movie with lookalikes, they would find three actors willing to be silly putty in their mischievous hands. And so, to play Larry, skilled clown Sean Hayes (""Will and Grace"") transforms himself by shaving his head down the middle, letting prickly tufts of Larry-like hair protrude on the sides. As baldy boy Curly, ""Mad TV's"" Will Sasso steps up with the needed rolypoly charm. And to play Moe, the bossy ringleader of Stooge domination, there's Greek-born Chris Diamantopoulos with a bowl cut and Brooklyn accent (""Soitenly"") that is Moe to the life. Once Sean Penn had designs on playing Larry, as Benicio del Toro had on Moe and Jim Carrey on Curly. But Hayes, Sasso and Diamantopoulos do themselves and the Stooges proud. The movie is a mixed bag. A theme runs through all three shorts. The Stooges, abandoned at birth at a Catholic orphanage, must now save the place from being closed in an economic turndown. They need $830,000 to save the kids and the nuns, including Mother Superior (Jane Lynch playing a straight man), Sister Bernice (Sports Illustrated model Kate Upton), Sister Rosemary (Oscar winner Jennifer Hudson) and, most memorable of all, Sister Mary-Mengele (Larry David in full drag and crankier than ever). The plot gets overcomplicated when the villainous Lydia (""Modern Family's"" Sofia Vergara), offers to pay the Stooges what they need to off her nerd husband, Teddy (Kirby Heyborne), a former orphan himself. The actors deserve a full-throated woo-woo-woo! But the gags don't blossom with repetition. The Stooges were always better in short doses. And 90 minutes of PG nyuk-nyuk-nyuk can seem like an eternity. Even when Moe hooks up with the cast of ""Jersey Shore,"" this century's bottom-feeding purveyors of lowbrow comedy, the jokes grow stale. For the Farrellys, ""The Three Stooges"" is a labor of love. For non-believers, it's merely a labor. See the full article at EW.com. Copyright © 2011 Rolling Stone.","Peter Travers: The Farrelly present a trio of Stooges shorts set in the present .

"(CNN) -- The West is understandably nervous about the election of Mohamed Morsi. The president-elect of Egypt is taking charge of a febrile situation. The economy is contracting and human rights abuses are rampant -- attacks on Coptic churches by Islamic groups have forced an estimated 100,000 Christians to flee the country. Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood is philosophically committed to creating a state governed by Islamic law, and some say that his victory poses a threat to Israel. Now he wants to reach out to Iran. But it would be wrong to conclude that Islamic democracy is a contradiction in terms. Whatever new state emerges in Egypt almost certainly won't be democratic in the liberal, European tradition, and there will be a constant fight to protect the rights of women and religious minorities. But the presumption that Morsi's political Islam is the vanguard of theocratic dictatorship ignores historical and contemporary evidence to the contrary. Islam is simply too complex to be stereotyped as the faith of tyrants. Early Muslim societies, romanticized by Islamists, were decentralized in nature and allowed for a large degree of self-government. The first caliphs were elected by tribal councils, and their powers were limited by legal scholars in a manner that approximates to constitutionalism. Rulers could, theoretically, be impeached; religious pluralism was tolerated. When Umar Ibn al-Khattab conquered Jerusalem in 637, he permitted Christians and Jews to remain in the holy city and worship freely in their own temples. The Covenant of Umar is one of history's first examples of a state guaranteeing religious freedom. The record of modern experiments in Islamic statecraft is tragically mixed. On the good side, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Mali, Senegal, Turkey and now Egypt are all some form of democracy. Even Iran has permitted a degree of popular representation. When the liberal-minded cleric Mohammad Khatami ran for the Iranian presidency in 1997, he was hindered by a media blackout and opposition from Iran's clerical leadership. Yet he won 70% on an 80% turnout and was permitted to serve two terms. (Admittedly, Khatami's achievements in advancing civil liberties were few, and he was hampered by clerical intervention in parliamentary elections.) Alas, there are many more examples across the Muslim world of dictatorships and parties implacably committed to violent fundamentalism. Saudi Arabia, for example, hasn't stopped the bankrolling of terrorism, forces its subjects to live by a strict reading of Sharia law and even tolerates beheadings for witchcraft. But while the Islamic emphasis upon submission to religious authority might have hardened resistance to Enlightenment values of pluralism and civil liberties, the legacy of Western imperialism shares responsibility, too. Central Asian countries such as Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan are former Soviet republics, Iran had its parliamentary democracy subverted by the West in the 1950s, and Saudi Arabian politics have been dominated by the international oil market. In short, the spread of democracy in the Islamic world has either been retarded by autocratic practices imported from the West, or subverted by Cold War politics and economic globalization. Pitted against these savage forces, Islam has sometimes offered a rare vehicle for anti-authoritarian dissent -- from Algeria to China. The fact that Islamic parties, such as the Muslim Brotherhood, have emerged from dictatorships bolstered by foreign arms has colored their politics -- to the degree that they regard Western ""democracy"" as a byword for imperialism. Nonetheless, there is some evidence that the Brotherhood is a diverse, pragmatic movement more concerned with reducing the influence of the secular state than erecting a theocracy in its place. The Brotherhood has certainly moderated its views in recent years to accommodate shifting domestic attitudes toward the veil, the presence of Westerners or alcohol. An example of a more temperate Islamism might be found in Morocco, where the appointment of an Islamist prime minister, Abdelilah Benkirane, has shown signs of opening the country up. He has promised transparency, a war on corruption and a fairer distribution of wealth. Crucially, anything more radical that the prime minister might try to do is tempered by Morocco's monarch and powerful army. This arrangement sees Islamism expanding popular representation while the political establishment safeguards secularism. We see some of that careful balance in the new Egypt. The military still enjoys enormous power, and it will effectively control the writing of a constitution. The army might be motivated by venial desires to protect its power and patronage, but the fact that Morsi is ultimately answerable to Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, chairman of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces and defense minister, means his ability to construct any kind of theocracy is severely limited. Although Western unease toward Morsi's Islamist politics is justified by recent experience, the existence of historical and political variation offers hope that Egypt won't become a new caliphate. On the contrary: In democracies, process is all -- and so far the process has been respected by everyone involved. The West's complaint that ""the wrong man won"" in Egypt mustn't detract from the fact that the country is still undergoing a remarkable, apparently progressive transition -- albeit at the cost of many lives. The people overthrew a dictator and then elected a new leader in free and fair elections. The very fact that the ""wrong man"" was even allowed to assume the presidency suggests that Egypt is embracing a more humane politics. So far, political Islam has facilitated, not hindered, the building of a democratic country. So far. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Timothy Stanley.","Timothy Stanley: Many worry that Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood leader will bring theocracy .
But Stanley says historic and modern evidence shows Islamic societies can be democratic .
He says Mali, Bangladesh and Morocco seek balance between Islam and openness .

"(CNN) -- Two bodies have been found by investigators probing the disappearance of a Tennessee mother and her three daughters, with authorities pleading Saturday for help in finding their suspected abductor -- a man they described as likely ""armed and dangerous."" The FBI, in a press release Saturday, did not say whose bodies were discovered. But the federal agency did identify the man who they believe ""is responsible for their disappearance"" as Adam Mayes, saying an arrest warrant has been issued for him. The husband of Jo Ann Bain, 31, reported his wife and the three girls -- 14-year-old Adrienne Bain, 12-year-old Alexandra Bain and 8-year-old Kyliyah Bain -- missing on April 27, according to the FBI. They were last seen in Whiteville, a town of about 4,600 people in western Tennessee. See pictures and descriptions of the girls and suspect here. Authorities ""initiated contact early in the investigation"" with Mayes, who was ""considered a friend of the family,"" but he fled, the FBI said. The 35-year-old white male -- who has blue eyes and brown hair, weighs about 175 pounds and stands 6 feet, 3 inches tall -- was last seen May 1 in Guntown, Mississippi. The two bodies tied to the case were found Friday at residences in Mississippi. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation issued an Amber Alert that day, though it wasn't widely publicized until Saturday. In it, authorities warned that the three sisters ""may be in extreme danger"" and that a kidnapping warrant had been issued for Mayes. He had recently cut his own hair and may have done the same to the three children, according to the Amber Alert . ""Adam Mayes should be considered armed and dangerous,"" the FBI said.

"(CNN) -- An emotional Novak Djokovic claimed his late grandfather was with him in spirit as he beat Robin Haase to reach the last four of the Monte Carlo Masters.

"OLLANTAYTAMBO, Peru (CNN) -- Stand anywhere in the Peruvian town of Ollantaytambo and look up. If your eyes don't fix on a magnificent Andes mountain peak, then you will surely be looking at one of the Incan ruins in the immediate area. Ollantaytambo offers spectacular views of a charming village, ancient ruins and magnificent mountains. No need to worry about a crick in your neck; the view at eye level is just as pretty. There are no neon signs, no hotels or restaurants with names that you will recognize, just charming local businesses set on cobblestone streets. Narrow chutes frame the streets and carry water from the mountaintops through town, toward the railroad tracks, and into the Urubamba River. The locals are easily recognized in their brightly colored hand-woven clothing -- bright blue, orange and red shirts and skirts -- as they go about their daily business, whether tending the nearby fields or guiding a mule carrying firewood. When planning a trip to the area's star attraction -- the mountaintop Incan ruins of Machu Picchu -- this gem of a town in Peru's Sacred Valley is not to be missed. The Sacred Valley is the area between Cusco -- the historic capital of the Incan Empire and the tourism gateway -- and Machu Picchu, which was recently voted one of the new seven wonders of the world. Typically, visitors who plan to stay overnight in the Sacred Valley are trying to adjust to the altitude before heading to the higher and larger city of Cusco. Acclimating to elevations of more than 11,000 feet above sea level is a good reason to head directly down to the valley after arriving at the Cusco Airport, but the tiny town called Ollantaytambo is another great reason to set aside at least a couple of your vacation days. Ollantaytambo is one of those rare places where you'd rather look at the beauty through the naked eye than through the lens of a camera. The camera just doesn't seem to capture the ""wow"" factor. During the dry season from April to October, the sky between the surrounding peaks is often a piercing azure blue. But visitors can't be expected to stand on a street corner taking in the view all day, and thankfully, there is plenty to do in this old Incan village. The main attraction, the Ollantaytambo Ruins, a former Incan fortress, attracts busloads of day trippers that unload by the market. From down the street, you can see the tourists climbing the many terraces that, during Incan times, were used for agriculture and decorative purposes. The highest point on the hill is where you will find the unfinished Temple of the Sun. On tours, visitors learn that these ruins were built in the shape of a llama, and guides will point out the face of the Incan sun god carved on the side of the neighboring mountain. You need to purchase a ticket to visit this site. Across town are other Incan sites, also visible from the town's cobblestone corners, where you can hike up to the ruins free of charge. There are many nice walks around the town, and the local museum has a display on the wall that lists the time they should take and the area to cover. If you want a break from the ruins, try white-water rafting, mountain climbing or horseback riding. And if you can't get enough of the natural beauty, opt for a bicycle trip down the Ambra Malaga Pass. Bicycle trip organizers will drive you up and drop you off on an asphalt road at about 14,000 feet above sea level, and you ride -- or really glide -- down on bicycles. Make sure your body has acclimated to the altitude of Ollantaytambo, which is about 9,186 feet, before you embark on this tour. The ride offers great views of the snow-capped Mount Veronica, and you'll see livestock grazing and patches of land being tended by farmers. The entire trip takes from three to four hours and costs about $40 per person. Once you have worked up an appetite, you can easily find a good meal in Ollantaytambo. A hearty local dish, lomo saltado, is served in most restaurants. This Peruvian dish is a stir fry that includes steak tidbits, white rice, french fries, onions and tomatoes in a brown gravy. If lomo saltado isn't adventurous enough for you, try alpaca or cuy (guinea pig). You can wash your meal down with a Pisco sour, the national drink in Peru, made with Pisco brandy, sugar, lemon juice and an egg white. There are enough restaurants to choose from, and in some establishments, the food is as good as the fancy places you will find in Cusco. There are several trains a day between Ollantaytambo and Machu Picchu, so it's feasible to do a day trip to visit the main attraction. It's about a two-hour drive to get to Ollantaytambo from the airport or Cusco's city center, and it costs no more than $30 U.S. by taxi. Buses are available and cost a lot less. Whether you take the bus, train or taxi, consider a stop in this impressive Incan town as you check the nearby world wonder off your list.","In Ollantaytambo, Peru, you can see magnificent mountains and Incan ruins .

"London (CNN) -- After three marathons, I really should know what to do by now. There is simply no substitute for plenty of training when running a marathon. But this Sunday I will be pounding the streets of my hometown Brighton, southern England, having done almost no preparation. So how will I fare? Ideally a marathon runner should be doing 40 to 50 miles a week for at least three or four months before race day. The training is intensely boring, but it conditions every part of the body -- including the mind -- for the pummeling that 26.2 miles exerts on it. My knees, shins, Achilles and hamstrings hurt the most as the miles mount, and they can only get stronger and more resilient through practice. I used to dismiss as a myth the notion of the ""wall,"" the pain barrier that marathon runners experience at about 20 miles. This happens when energy reserves are depleted, forcing the body to start burning fat. It can leave you feeling nauseous -- again, training helps to condition the body to running long distances. However, I hit the wall in both my last two races, and I'm terrified it will happen again this Sunday. Before my previous well-prepared marathons I ran respectable times of about three hours and 30 minutes. This year though, just like the excuses I used to give for failing to do my homework at school, I simply haven't had time to do enough practice runs. The only real distances under my belt are the three miles that I walk each day from Victoria Station in London up to CNN's bureau in Soho. An intense workload at both the office and home mean I rarely have time to spend the one or two hours on top of this that I should be doing. So in a desperate effort to get race-fit, I have been trying to pack about four months of training into just two or three weeks. But three demanding children and a house restoration project mean the only time I've had to run is late at night. This means I've been trudging along Brighton's seafront, running the gauntlet of its colorful nightlife, such as night-clubbers, stag and hen nights and assorted other lost souls. I've heard several other runners recently talking smugly about tapering down in the final stages of marathon preparation. I'm still tapering up. Last night I ran 17 miles and felt shattered. I hope I feel better for this Sunday's race. I don't know if I'll last the distance but I intend to find out. Follow my last-minute preparations here. Next week I'll tell you how it went. A week later ... Well, it seems I was fitter than I feared! After worrying that I hadn't done nearly enough training for Sunday's Brighton marathon, I finished in a creditable three hours and 35 minutes -- only a couple of minutes slower than last year's time. Most of my longer runs were done in the fortnight before the race -- contradicting the usual advice that you train for three or four months, then ease off, or taper, in the last 10 days or so. Still, I must have been doing something right, as I felt reasonably comfortable for most of the race. It only really became an ordeal for the last two or three miles, when my legs and feet felt like concrete and my chest started to tighten. I was helped on my way -- as ever during a marathon -- by the thousands of spectators lining the route. Many of them handed me jelly baby sweets, which provided a welcome lift as I neared the finish. The weather was perfect for running: sunny but fresh, and I in fact enjoyed, yes enjoyed, the whole day. I felt pretty rough straight after the race, but better than last year when I was sick after I crossed the line. But I managed to keep walking -- always the best strategy, and walked the mile back to my home where I lay on the sofa all afternoon. I managed to hobble about the house, but I got my children to be my slaves for the day. I didn't sleep very well on Sunday night because my legs were tingling so much. On Monday I went to work in London and my legs were more stiff but not painful, but I managed to walk three miles. It was a bit of a struggle getting in and out of my chair but by Tuesday the stiffness had pretty much gone, and now I can't tell I ran 26 miles four days ago. I even ran the 1.5 miles from Victoria Station to the CNN bureau in Soho this morning in 15 minutes. I can only conclude that the exercise I take during the rest of the year is sufficient to keep me fit enough to run a marathon. Who knows: maybe training is all a myth! It certainly saved me a lot of time -- I always find the worst thing about preparing for a marathon is the monotony of running mile after boring mile for months beforehand . So I would implore anyone considering a marathon to get out and give it a go: it's really not as hard as you might think. Sure, 26.2 miles (42 kilometers) is a long way, but as long as you have a decent level of fitness, you'll be able to run a fairly fast marathon. You never know, you might even enjoy it!","Peter Wilkinson is CNN's Senior Digital Producer .

"London (CNN) -- Victoria Azarenka has claimed her first grand slam title after comprehensively beating Maria Sharapova 6-3 6-0 in the final of the Australian Open in Melbourne. The Belorussian took just one hour and 22 minutes to see off her Russian challenger, who won the title back in 2008. Azarenka's victory, which comes in her first appearance in a grand slam final, also sees her succeed Caroline Wozniacki as the world number one. The 22-year-old made a tentative start to the match losing her opening service game with Sharapova backing up the break with a service hold. At 0-30 down in the third game she was in danger of handing the five-time grand slam winner a decisive advantage, but Azarenka fought back to win the next four points and the game to keep the Russian in her sights. Maria Sharapova's fashion statement . From that point on she didn't look back, out-powering and in many rallies outwitting her more experienced opponent. She immediately broke the Sharapova serve and backed it up with another break in the eighth game before serving out the set. It was one-way traffic in the second set as Azarenka grew in confidence and Sharapova's challenge faded. Break points in the first, third and fifth games were all greedily snapped up as Azarenka romped to the title. ""I can't wait to be back next year, I've had an amazing month in Australia.

"(CNN) -- The early-morning slaughter of four Florida siblings at the hands of what authorities say was their mother is an ""almost unheard of"" case, crime experts said Wednesday. Investigators are still trying to determine what happened at the Port St. John home of 33-year-old Tonya Thomas early Tuesday morning. But Patricia Pearson, author of ""When She was Bad: How and Why Women Get Away with Murder,"" said mass killings with women as a perpetrator are rare -- and when they do happen, they typically aren't committed with guns. ""If a gun was used, that's almost unheard of,"" Pearson told CNN. Women make up about 5% of the ranks of mass killers, said James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University. And most cases in which women kill their families involve young children, said Fox, the author of ""Extreme Killing: Understanding Serial and Mass Murder."" Sheriff's deputies in Brevard County say Thomas turned a .38-caliber revolver on herself after killing her two sons, 15-year-old Jaxs Johnson and 12-year-old Joel Johnson, and two daughters, 17-year-old Pebbles Johnson and 13-year-old Jazlin Johnson. The children went to a neighbor's house when the shooting started, with at least one reporting being shot, according to recordings of 911 calls released by the sheriff's department Tuesday -- but they returned while neighbors were on the phone with deputies, and more shots followed. ""The two kids were in the front yard, one banging on the front door, 'Help us! Help us!'"" a neighbor told dispatchers. ""There was so much confusion going on we couldn't tell who shot who, and then when I was talking to you the one kid said his mom shot him."" ""I cried so much,"" slain boy's classmate says . Investigators don't know a motive for the killings, said Lt. Tod Goodyear, a spokesman for the Brevard County Sheriff's Office. But he said neighbors have described a history of public arguments among Thomas and her children, and Jaxs Johnson was arrested after a pair of fights with his mother in April. The teen was charged with domestic violence after a pair of fights with his mother, according to records released by the sheriff's office. In the first, on April 8, he knocked out a window with his bicycle during a fight; Thomas told deputies ""she is attempting to get him into different programs to help with his issues."" The following day, she said, her son punched and kicked her when she tried to wake him for school, then ran out of the house. She again called deputies, who arrested him on April 10, Goodyear said. He spent at least two days in juvenile detention after the arrest and had a court date scheduled for Tuesday, Goodyear said. Thomas herself had been arrested on domestic violence charges in 2002, after a fight with her former boyfriend, the children's father, Goodyear said. Fox said the circumstances appear to be a case of ""suicide by proxy,"" in which a family member takes the lives of her loved ones ""out of a warped sense of love"" before killing herself. ""Typically, the perpetrator is suicidal, feels life is miserable and doesn't want to go on,"" Fox said. ""But why does she take her children? Because she wished to be reunited them in the afterlife or wants to spare them the misery of this life."" Usually the victims in such cases are young children, however -- ""partly because young children are vulnerable,"" he said. ""Older kids can run away."" And the reported circumstances are ""really unusual,"" far different from typical cases involving either women or men. In an e-mail to CNN, Pearson said that in cases where women kill their children, ""They target them because that is their sphere of power, and also their source of stress."" But she added, ""I've never seen a case where the children were this old, however. They're almost always under 5.""","Women make up only about 5% of mass killers, a criminologist says .

"(CNN) -- A 19-year-old man was arrested Tuesday afternoon on charges of eight counts of shooting with intent to kill in the violence following the Oklahoma City Thunder's playoff victory over the Los Angeles Lakers, authorities said. Rodney Dewon Hill was arrested about 4:30 p.m. (5:30 p.m. ET), Oklahoma City Police Capt. Dexter Nelson said. The investigation will continue as police have ""outstanding suspects,"" he said. Hill was identified by a ""victim/witness"" in the shooting, according to an affidavit filed in Oklahoma County District Court by Inspector K. Whitebird. Eight people were shot Monday night just blocks from the Chesapeake Energy Arena as large crowds were leaving the playoff game between the Lakers and the Thunder, police said. The Thunder eliminated the Lakers from the playoffs and advanced to the next round. ""We have no reason to believe that this was associated directly with the game,"" Nelson said. ""There has been some speculation, but we don't have any information on that. ""It's too early for us to tell (whether) this was gang-related or not,"" he added. As crowds left the arena, Nelson said, ""there was some horse-playing going on"" and ""it was a group of girls that got into a confrontation with a group of guys."" Whitebird's affidavit said three males and a female ""were involved in an altercation with several of the victims of the shooting. ""Witnesses also corroborated that there were two separate groups involved in an argument,"" the affidavit said. One of the males pulled a gun from his waist and began shooting into the crowd, Whitebird said in the affidavit. Added Nelson: ""Two or three of the people that were injured were just innocent bystanders."" Of the victims, one was in critical condition and seven suffered non-life-threatening injuries, Nelson said. Some of the seven were admitted for hospitalization, he said. ""We still have interviews to conduct. We know we have witnesses out there that haven't contacted us,"" Nelson said. Also, a woman was injured when she was punched and kicked in the crowded streets, authorities said. The affidavit said the woman is pregnant. In a statement Tuesday, the Oklahoma City Thunder said team officials were talking with police to determine what happened and whether it could have been prevented. ""We are saddened to hear of the violence following the game last night. It put a damper on what was otherwise an exciting night for Oklahoma City and the Thunder,"" the statement said. Thousands of people were in the area because the Thunder beat the Lakers 106-90 to advance to the Western Conference finals. ""Whenever you get about 8,000 people outside of a venue, we are going to be outnumbered,"" Nelson told CNN affiliate KOCO. ""You can't have enough people down here for that."" Several people had been questioned about the shootings, but no arrests had been made as of Tuesday afternoon, KOCO reported. ""We will continue to work closely with law enforcement and the city to review security and crowd control procedures and we stand ready to make any necessary changes to ensure safety,"" the Thunder said Tuesday. CNN's Nick Valencia contributed to this report.","A 19-year-old man is arrested on eights counts of shooting with intent to kill, police say .

"(CNN) -- The young women in a Kabul classroom are learning how to deal with a difficult birth. As instructors watch over and guide the simulation, the girls gently tug at a baby doll as it passes through the model of a birth canal. These students, all in their third semester at the Ghazanfar Institute of Health Sciences, will soon join the growing number of midwives in a country where being a mother is ranked among the worst in the world. Women in Afghanistan are 70 times more likely to die in childbirth than from a bullet or a bomb, according to Save the Children. It's a grim statistic the women here are trying to change. ""My father encouraged me to do this because when he was 10, he lost his mother when she was giving birth to another child,"" says Almasa Katawazi, who, like the rest of her classmates, hopes to make Afghanistan a better, safer place for mothers and their babies. Katawazi says she wants women in far-flung provinces to have access to good medical facilities, doctors and midwives. To that end, she says she plans to go and work in Paktika province once she's certified. In 2003, there were only about 500 midwives in Afghanistan. Today, there are some 3,000. But many more are needed. ""Increasing the numbers of midwives, particularly midwives that live and work within communities and rural communities that might not have access to other health services is an extremely important factor in reducing maternal mortality,"" says Rachel Maranto of Save the Children. Still, less than two-thirds of Afghan women have access to nearby health facilities. ""Many, many mothers and children will never see a trained health worker, a doctor, a nurse or a midwife in their lifetime,"" Maranto says, ""and that really needs to be improved and turned around."" It's one of the reasons why groups such as Save the Children, along with other nongovernmental organizations and foreign donors, are funding programs in conjunction with the country's Ministry of Public Health to improve the chances of mothers' and children's welfare and survival. A mother bravely campaigns for president . One pilot program in Guldara District teaches volunteers how to become community health workers. Many of the women being trained have lost mothers, sisters and cousins to pregnancy-related complications. Many have also buried their babies. They decided it was time to change things. The women are illiterate, so they learn from pictograms. ""It's good work,"" says Noorzi, a mother of six. ""In my village, maternal mortality has gone down 100% in the last two years."" Noorzi's village may be an exception, but most women there now give birth in the presence of qualified health workers. Still, sustaining and spreading initiatives such as this one will take even more investment from the international community. And while NGOs point to a certain success in the reduction of mother and child mortality rates in recent years, the situation in Afghanistan remains dire -- here, a woman dies from pregnancy-related causes every two hours. That statistic is just one that illustrates the fragile state of women in Afghanistan more than a decade since Western forces ousted Taliban rule. Speaking out against rape | Tortured teen: 'Same should be done to them' Back in the Kabul classroom, the midwives in training stay focused. ""Their main goal should be serving mothers and decreasing the rate of maternal mortality,"" says Turpekai Azizi, a midwife instructor. It's a noble goal, but one that could be in jeopardy, women and aid workers say they fear, if foreign funding falls off once coalition troops withdraw.","Afghanistan has long been ranked among the worst in the world for mothers .

"(CNN) -- Great tennis rivals Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal will lock horns once again in Saturday's semifinals of the Indian Wells Masters event in California. Federer, seeking to reach the final for the first time since 2006 when he won it for the third year in a row, was first into the last four as he added another milestone to his illustrious CV. The former world No. 1 thrashed ninth seed Juan Martin del Potro 6-3 6-2 on Friday to become the first man to win 250 matches in Masters 1000 level tournaments. Last year's runner-up Nadal then overcame another Argentine -- former world No. 3 David Nalbandian -- despite dropping his first set of the U.S. hard-court event in a 4-6 7-5 6-4 victory. ""They're always special matches, especially because they're always in very important matches for both of us,"" said Nadal, who beat Federer in the Australian Open semifinals in January to move 18-9 ahead in career meetings. ""That always makes the match very special. But even if it's not the final, being in the semifinals is an important match. ""Playing against Roger always means a little bit more than against the rest of the opponents because I am playing probably against the best of the history, and because I played probably the most important matches of my career against him and probably him against me. That's why it makes the match a little bit more special than the rest."" Federer and Del Potro were both seeking their 20th victories of this year, but the 16-time grand slam champion comfortably won for the fourth time in 2012 against the man who beat him in the 2009 U.S. Open final. ""I sort of expected myself to come out and play a good match today after the struggle I had against Thomaz Bellucci,"" the 30-year-old said. ""I don't usually struggle back-to-back days, so this was for me a really good match against a great player. I'm happy I was able to maintain the great streak I've got going against him this year."" Federer has won 37 of his last 39 matches, the other loss coming to John Isner in the Davis Cup while playing for Switzerland. Home hope Isner plays defending champion and world No. 1 Novak Djokovic in the first of Saturday's semifinals. He is bidding to become the first American ATP Tour player to triumph in the Palm Desert since Andre Agassi in 2001. But the 26-year-old is 0-2 against Australian Open champion Djokovic. Meanwhile, top-ranked Victoria Azarenka will play world No. 2 Maria Sharapova in Sunday's women's final in Indian Wells. Azarenka extended her unbeaten run to 22 matches, surpassing Serena Williams' start to 2003, as she beat German 18th seed Angelique Kerber 6-4 6-3 to claim the best beginning to a campaign since Martina Hingis went 37-0 in 1997. ""I'm really impressed by the way Angelique was playing,"" Azarenka said of her opponent, who has reached seven semifinals in her last 11 events. ""It was the first time we played on the pro tour, so it was a little bit new for me, and she showed some excellent tennis. I think she's a great player and she really pushed me to raise my level and really dig to win that match."" Sharapova, the 2006 champion in Indian Wells, had easier progress to the final as her opponent -- fellow former No. 1 Ana Ivanovic -- retired with a hip injury while trailing 6-4 0-1. Ivanovic won the tournament in 2008 and was runner-up the following year, but the Serbian has slipped to 16th in the rankings. ""I started to feel it in the middle of the first set,"" she said. ""It just got gradually worse and worse. I started to feel a lot of pain through my glute and couldn't load on my backhand side. ""After the treatment it was getting worse and worse rapidly. We taped it and I tried to continue, but I couldn't even stand there on my return."" Sharapova lost to Azarenka in January's Australian Open final, and the Russian will be seeking to prevent her Belorussian rival from winning a fourth title in 2012. ""She's definitely the one to beat right now, someone that's playing with a lot of confidence and all the momentum in the world,"" Sharapova said. ""I'd love to get my revenge from Australia and play much better, as well. In our previous meetings we had really tough matches and I hope the quality of tennis will be good and hopefully I can change a few things around this time.""","Roger Federer to play Rafael Nadal in Saturday's semifinals at Indian Wells .

"Austin, Texas (CNN) -- Anyone expecting outspoken rocker Bruce Springsteen to spend his keynote address here at the South by Southwest music conference talking about his new No. 1 album or the politically divided state of the country may have gotten a surprise. Instead, Springsteen delivered a rousing, witty and personal history of his varied music influences -- from Elvis Presley to Bob Dylan to James Brown to Hank Williams -- punctuating his points by playing snippets of songs on a guitar. He also offered a little veteran advice for the thousands of young, unknown musicians who have descended upon Austin in the hopes of making it big. ""Stay hard. Stay hungry. Stay alive,"" he said in his familiar rasp. ""And when you walk onstage tonight to bring the noise, treat it like it's all you have."" Springsteen is at SXSW to help launch ""Wrecking Ball,"" his 17th studio album, which voices his frustrations over what he sees as a lack of accountability by government and financial leaders for the country's economic woes. Several members of his E Street Band were in the audience, and he and the band were scheduled to perform at a 2,000-seat theater Thursday night in Austin before kicking off a North American arena tour Sunday in Atlanta. Thursday afternoon's event placed the current Rolling Stone cover boy in an unusual setting: Behind a podium in a packed convention hall -- and in the middle of the day, no less. Looking a little bleary-eyed, Springsteen took the stage 30 minutes late, carrying his notes on sheafs of paper, and immediately complained about the time. ""How important can this speech be if we're giving it at noon?"" he asked. ""Every decent musician in town is asleep. Or they will be when I'm done with this thing."" Springsteen began his talk by marveling at the thousands of bands, in almost every musical genre, who are playing Austin this week and how that would have been inconceivable to him as a young music fan. He then pointed out how fractured the music landscape has become and how hard it is for consumers with divergent tastes to gain critical consensus around an artist -- including himself. In what may have been an allusion to today's manufactured pop stars, he argued that what matters most in music is ""purity of human expression,"" not looks or labels or digital format. ""We live in a post-authentic world. Today authenticity is a house of mirrors,"" he said in his hourlong talk. ""It's about what you're bringing [onstage] when the lights go down."" Springsteen then began recounting his personal journey through music, beginning when he first saw Presley on ""The Ed Sullivan Show"" at age 6. He managed to get his hands on a rented guitar, but his hands were too small to play it, so he just struck rock poses in front of the mirror. ""I still do that,"" he said with a chuckle. As a teenager, he recalled gazing in wonder at the Beatles' first record in a five-and-dime store. But the '60s band that made the biggest impression on him was Eric Burdon and The Animals, whose gritty rebelliousness spoke to him deeply. To make his point, Springsteen strummed a few verses from ""We Gotta Get Out of This Place,"" with its chorus, ""We gotta get out of this place/,'cause girl, there's a better life/for me and you ..."" ""That's every song I've ever written,"" he said. ""That's all of them. I'm not kidding."" To show how The Animals' songs shaped his own, he strummed a few chords from ""Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood,"" before segueing into ""Badlands"" and its similar structure. ""Listen up youngsters!"" he said to laughs from the crowd. ""This is how successful theft is accomplished."" When it came to songwriting, Springsteen acknowledged he owes a huge debt to Dylan, whose lyrics gave voice to the turbulent '60s and who he called ""the father of my musical country, now and forever."" When Springsteen became famous in the mid-1970s, he and fellow singer-songwriters such as John Prine were given the dreaded ""new Dylan"" label. ""The old Dylan was only 30,"" he said.

Springsteen went on to cite his love of '60s and '70s soul singers such as James Brown and Curtis Mayfield, who played ""music of gritty determination, of the blues, of the earth."" He also drew inspiration from the lonesome-blues songs of country icon Hank Williams, which he said reduced him to tears. ""Country music was provincial. And so was I,"" he said. ""I was not a bohemian, or a hipster. I was an average guy with maybe an above-average gift."" In his twenties Springsteen said he read a biography of folk singer Woody Guthrie, whose American protest songs ""spoke to me very deeply."" As if to prove it, he picked up his guitar again and led the South By Southwest audience in a few choruses of ""This Land is Your Land"" before leaving the stage.","Bruce Springsteen delivers a personal history of his music influences at music conference .

"(CNN) -- The road back to the top of world golf is proving to be a long and arduous one for former world No. 1 Tiger Woods. But a legend of the game has seen enough in the 14-time major winner's recent game to suggest he is closing in on his best form. Ahead of the annual PGA Tour tournament he hosts at the Bay Hill Club in Florida, seven-time major champion Arnold Palmer warned the field at this weekend's event to be wary of a revitalized Woods. Woods still a force in video-game world . ""I'm watching him swing and I'm watching him play, and I see some moments of the old-fashioned Tiger that are very good,"" the 82-year-old Palmer told reporters. ""So you know, if I were making a prediction, I would say, look out, because one of these days, he's going to come back and play pretty good golf."" Woods has been plagued by knee and Achilles injuries in recent years, as well as going through a high-profile divorce after details of his extra-marital affairs emerged in late 2009. But, having slipped outside the world's top-50 rankings in October last year, he won the unsanctioned Chevron World Challenge event he hosts in December and then finished tied for third at the Abu Dhabi Golf Championship in January -- his debut event for 2012. However, the 36-year-old was hampered by an Achilles complaint at the recent World Golf Championship event at Doral, where he pulled out midway through the final round. There were initial fears the injury could force Woods out of the Masters, where he has worn the fabled Green Jacket on four occasions, but those concerns were allayed when he played in the Tavistock Cup earlier this week. Woods played a practice round at Augusta on Sunday, before pulling up while preparing for the Arnold Palmer Invitational -- which he has won six times -- after being distracted by a photographer during his downswing. ""I guess one of the so-called professional photographers took a picture right in the middle of my downswing,"" Woods told reporters. ""I stopped it, and then felt a pretty good twinge in my back. ""I walked it off and then tried to hit one down there, hit it in the fairway, but it didn't feel very good. But after a couple of holes it loosened up and I'm good to go now."" Woods has been paired with U.S. Ryder Cup teammate Hunter Mahan and three-time major winner Ernie Els for Thursday's first round at Bay Hill and he is feeling confident after his outing at the Tavistock Cup. ""That's one of the reasons why I played Tavistock,"" he said. ""It felt great at Augusta, and that was the test. I played Tavistock because of that test, and here I am ready to go.""","Arnold Palmer says Tiger Woods is showing signs of returning to top form .

"Raleigh, North Carolina (CNN) -- The state Democratic Party here is consumed with an ongoing sexual harassment scandal. The embattled governor is so unpopular she decided not to run for a second term. And supporters of same-sex marriage were dealt a crushing defeat at the ballot box last week. But the biggest challenge in North Carolina this year for President Barack Obama and his fellow Democrats can be boiled down to something simpler: math. Everything that could have gone right for Obama in 2008 did go right, and yet he still only won North Carolina by just 14,177 votes -- a tiny sliver of the 4.2 million cast statewide. Thanks to his campaign's striking ability to expand the Democratic electorate, Obama even managed to win the state while losing independents to John McCain. Volunteers blitzed college campuses and dominated the early voting game. New African-American voters were registered in huge numbers. Obama also performed better among white voters than both John Kerry and Al Gore. Crucially, Republican turnout fell off dramatically from 2004. Obama world read the victory as a promising sign of Democratic realignment in the South and rewarded the Tar Heel State with the Democratic National Convention, which will take place in Charlotte in September. Today, though, it's hard to find a Democrat in the capital of Raleigh who believes the president, saddled with the burdens of governing and a sputtering economy, can stir the enthusiasm of 2008 and repeat his near-flawless North Carolina performance. ""My heart says he will win here, but my head says it's going to be awfully tough for him,"" said Gary Pearce, a longtime Democratic consultant and adviser to former Gov. Jim Hunt. ""This is a tight state for him. Race is part of it. The economy is a big problem. Four years ago he was new, he was exciting. He was hope and change. That has worn off now. The glow is gone. It's going to be tough for him to catch magic in the bottle again."" Obama's fading luster has put enormous pressure on his team not only to mobilize the existing Democratic base but also to find new voters. The president's path to victory becomes even narrower if Republican turnout grows from the dismal 31% showing of 2008 -- a certainty according to political operatives in Raleigh who watched in 2010 as a fired-up GOP captured both houses of the state Legislature for the first time since Reconstruction. North Carolina is fast becoming a proving ground for advisers to Obama and Mitt Romney, who stress that the presidential race will be decided by the slimmest of margins in a handful of states. Turning out voters is key . ""The election is going to be won by the candidate who gets their voters to the polls,"" said state Rep. Alma Adams, a Democrat from Greensboro and the chairwoman of the Legislative Black Caucus. ""That's where the election is going to be determined. We need to focus on the people who are registered to vote and get them active and participating in the process."" A popular talking point among Republicans here involves the celebrated ""youth vote"" of 2008, a key part of the Obama coalition. The share of voters under 30 was the same in North Carolina as it was nationally. But thanks in large part to the stout organizational efforts of the Obama campaign on more than 100 college campuses across the state, voters between 18 and 29 chose Obama over McCain by a stunning 74%-26% margin. If that split more closely resembled the youth vote nationwide -- 66% for Obama and 32% for McCain -- roughly 60,000 North Carolina votes would have swung to McCain, handing him the state and its 15 electoral votes. Even the slightest shifts in turnout can determine the race, a prospect relished by Republicans, who were hamstrung in the last election by dampened conservative enthusiasm and a superior Democratic ground game. ""McCain did very little in North Carolina, and Obama did everything,"" said Dee Stewart, a Republican strategist in Raleigh. ""The McCain campaign's presence was minimal at best. While that was happening, the Obama campaign was knocking on the doors, not only of swing voters but of solid Republican voters."" The Romney campaign recently moved a state director to Raleigh and is piggybacking off the early joint efforts of the North Carolina GOP and the Republican National Committee, which have opened four field offices so far. Outsourcing of jobs could be problem for Romney . Romney, though, has his own challenges to overcome. The Obama campaign has painted the former Bain Capital executive as a corporate raider who shut down factories for the sake of a profit, a message they are pushing aggressively in a state racked by the outsourcing of textile and furniture manufacturing jobs. To win statewide in North Carolina, Republicans must sway evangelicals and ""Jessecrats"" -- those white cultural conservatives loyal to the late Sen. Jesse Helms -- in the eastern part of the state. But the former Massachusetts governor struggled to rally conservatives throughout the Republican primaries, particularly in the South. Adams, the Legislative Black Caucus leader, said Romney's Mormon faith might be a drag among among the social conservatives who showed up in large numbers last week to vote for a constitutional amendment defining marriage solely as between a man and a woman. Opinion: N.C. gay marriage vote spells the end of Obama . ""If they look at that awful ballot amendment, and they compare that with his faith, I don't think people will be OK with it,"" Adams said. ""From what I understand about the Mormon faith you can have multiple wives. That's sort of a contradiction. There are questions about who Romney is and what he believes in terms of that particular issue."" Still, Republicans in the state said that antipathy toward Obama will be enough to galvanize the conservative base. Stewart, the GOP strategist, calmly predicted that if Romney runs the aggressive campaign in North Carolina that McCain did not -- and focuses on the economy and suburban voters -- ""he should win by a substantial margin."" Romney looks for advantage in North Carolina . That forecast is not limited to Republicans. One senior North Carolina Democrat, who insisted on anonymity because of involvement in multiple statewide and legislative campaigns, said private polling in a variety of state races shows that white voters and independents are trending toward Republicans in an alarming way. ""The biggest thing Obama has got to overcome here is his problems with white independent voters, those middle-of-the-road voters,"" the Democrat said. ""If he doesn't, we are going to get our asses whipped like I have never seen in my 20 years of doing politics."" The Democrat predicted a ""bloodbath"" for the party in November if those numbers fail to tighten. Holding the convention in Charlotte, this person said, might make for an exciting week but will do little to push the state in Obama's direction: ""I'm glad that it's here for sheer state pride, but is it going to make much difference at Wilber's Barbecue in Goldsboro?"" Finding new voters critical for Obama's chances . Obama won 35% of North Carolina whites in 2008, a number most Democrats say he needs to come close to matching again if he hopes to win the state, even with the help of a growing minority population that could give him some numerical breathing room. And yet Republicans and Democrats agree that if any campaign can overcome the daunting arithmetic, it's Obama's. His campaign excelled here in 2008 as it worked college campuses and African-American communities hard, capitalizing on early voting and same-day registration to bank a significant number of votes before Election Day. Obama for America has 15 field offices around the state. More are slated to open in the coming months. Some organizers never left the state after 2008, and the campaign hired 22 new staffers last month. Campaign volunteers also went to work under the radar in several local campaigns last year -- including the Charlotte mayor's race and school board races in populous Wake County -- to elect friendly Democrats and identify new voters. Finding those new voters will be critical for the Obama team as they try to grow the electorate from 2008, and the steady North Carolina population boom offers a fertile hunting ground. In April alone, the campaign registered 15,000 new voters. ""Kids who were freshmen and sophomores in college in 2008 are gone, they are not on campus anymore,"" said Scott Falmlen, a Democratic consultant advising gubernatorial candidate Walter Dalton. ""But the upside is that you also have a whole new crop of students to register and organize and motivate. And if the campaign can do that, and they certainly have the infrastructure in place to do it, they will reap a lot of votes."" How Obama is using student loan issue to recapture the youth vote . Out-of-staters continue to flock to the financial hub of Charlotte, home to Bank of America, and to the Raleigh-Durham area for jobs in the high-tech and pharmaceutical sectors. More than half the North Carolina vote is concentrated in 13 counties along the Interstate 85 corridor, and those areas have grown dramatically since Obama won in 2008. Nearly 1 million people will reside in Charlotte's Mecklenburg County -- the state's largest -- by the end of this year, according to estimates from the Office of State Budget and Management. That's up from a population of 888,730 in 2008. In Wake County, the heart of the Research Triangle, the population has jumped by nearly 100,000 over the same four-year span. Though the rural-to-urban trend has defined the state's politics over the last decade, some Democrats said that Obama's organization can only take him so far in a state with decidedly moderate tendencies and a 9.7% unemployment rate -- the fourth highest in the nation. ""I don't think mechanics alone do it,"" said Pearce, the former Hunt adviser. ""An essential part of Obama winning here is to reignite the spark. Idealism, hope, whatever it is. He had an ability to inspire last time. Without that, he can't win.""","President Barack Obama won North Carolina in 2008 election by less than 15,000 votes .

"(CNN) -- Chelsea still have work to do if they are to qualify for next season's Champions League after dropping points in a 1-1 draw at Fulham in the English Premier League on Monday night. This year's only English representatives in the semifinals of Europe's leading cup competition were pegged back by a late Clint Dempsey goal after Frank Lampard had given the Blues the lead. The English midfielder scored his 150th Premier League goal from the penalty spot in the 45th minute after Danny Murphy had brought down Salomon Kalou. Chelsea pushed for a decisive second goal after the break but couldn't find an opening, and as the game wore on Fulham applied more pressure. Aaron Hughes was unlucky not to score 10 minutes from the end, foiled only by the quick hands of Petr Cech who palmed the ball over the crossbar. But from the resulting corner Fulham got their reward as Dempsey's header, which took a slight deflection off Chelsea defender Gary Cahill, found its way past Cech. The result leaves Chelsea still two points adrift of fourth place on 57 points. The draw lifts Fulham to ninth. The west London club's immediate rivals for the final Champions League place experienced mixed fortunes earlier in the day. Tottenham went down to a 2-1 defeat to Norwich City at White Hart Lane. Anthony Pilkington put Norwich ahead in the 13th minute before Jermain Defoe equalized 12 minutes before the break. But it was the visitors who eventually came away with all three points as Elliott Bennett drilled home the winner midway through the second half. Newcastle United joined Spurs on 59 points as they notched up a fifth successive win beating Bolton Wanderers 2-0. Two-second half goals from French midfielder Hatem Ben Arfa and Papa Cisse sees the Magpies continue a remarkable season. Everton scored four second-half goals against Sunderland at Goodison Park to consolidate their lead over Merseyside rivals Liverpool who travel to Blackburn on Tuesday. French striker Magaye Gueye opened the scoring seven minutes after the break. Steven Pienaar added a second in the 75th with Leon Osman firing home a minute later to ensure three points. Nigerian striker Victor Anichebe deflected effort in the 81st minute completed a miserable afternoon for Martin O'Neill's side.","Frank Lampard scores his 150th Premier League goal in 1-1 draw with Fulham .

"(CNN) -- They already have the record for the longest final in grand slam history, and now tennis rivals Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic are preparing to make history again in an ambitious bid to attract the biggest crowd. The world's top-ranked players will go head-to-head in a special match for charity at Real Madrid's Bernabeu Stadium on July 14. No. 1 Djokovic and his predecessor Nadal hope to draw 80,000 fans -- which would smash the previous record set by two of the sport's top women players. The Spanish football club's pitch will be transformed into a tennis court, with the event taking place in the gap between between Wimbledon and the London Olympics. The showdown is the result of a partnership between two charities, the Real Madrid Foundation and the Rafa Nadal Foundation, and aims to raise money for disadvantaged children. Djokovic and Spaniard Nadal made history at the Australian Open in January, when the Serb won his fifth grand slam title in a five-set epic lasting almost six hours. Now they hope to shatter the record for the largest turnout at an exhibition match -- set in July 2010 when 35,681 people watched Kim Clijsters beat fellow former world No. 1 Serena Williams in Brussels. Nadal, a Real Madrid supporter who tries to attend as many matches as possible, said he was thrilled to be taking part in the historic event. ""Back to practicing, very happy because the Rafa Nadal Foundation's event has been confirmed at Bernabeu!"" he announced on his Facebook page. Nadal still leads 16-14 in career clashes with Djokovic, despite losing the last seven of their finals meetings.","Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic hope to break the record for the largest crowd .

"United Nations (CNN) -- Syria's U.N. ambassador lashed out Thursday at criticism of his daughter, who was in the news last week after ABC News' Barbara Walters expressed regret for having tried to help her. ""This is an unethical, immoral, baseless, unfounded, animal and brutal approach toward personal issues related to my family,"" Bashar Jaafari told reporters here after being asked to address the issue of his daughter's link to Columbia University. ""Somebody is seeking to get to the Syrian ambassador,"" he continued. ""Since they don't have any possibility to get to that, they are trying to attack me through my own daughter. This is why this is an unethical approach -- and immoral."" Walters has said she should not have tried to help Sheherazad Jaafari obtain an internship and admission to Columbia's prestigious School of International and Public Affairs. ""In retrospect, I realize that this created a conflict and I regret that,"" Walters said last week in a statement. Walters said Sheherazad Jaafari contacted her following the reporter's return from Syria to the United States after a December ABC interview with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Sheherazad Jaafari had coached al-Assad before the interview on how to describe the violence there, according to e-mails purportedly from Syrian officials released in February by the hacking group known as Anonymous. ""Don't talk reform,"" she wrote in one e-mail. ""American's (sic) won't care, or understand that. ... American psyche can be easily manipulated when they hear that there are 'mistakes' done and now we are 'fixing it.'"" On her resume, Jaafari said she graduated from college in June 2010 and worked for a year as an account executive at Brown Lloyd James, a public relations firm, in New York. Sheherazad Jaafari said Wednesday that she had met a number of English-speaking journalists during a three-month, unpaid internship she undertook late last year in Syria while preparing to return to school to pursue her master's degree. ""My main intention as a new graduate was to expose myself to the world of media and communication, which are the fields that I have interest in,"" she said in an e-mail to CNN. ""Unfounded reports published recently have wrongfully claimed that I was the aide of the President of Syria. I want to make clear that I have never served as a President aid (sic) to the President of Syria,"" she continued."" She added, ""I am nothing but a victim for some personal agendas."" Sheherazad Jaafari said that she gained admission to Columbia based on her own qualifications. What is occurring in Syria ""and to my people saddens me and breaks my heart. It is in my prayers that peace and stability will prevail."" In e-mails obtained by CNN, she struck a personal tone toward the Syrian president. ""I miss ur voice already,"" she wrote al-Assad in late December. ""Give me a call whenever u can so I could get some energy from you and tell you how much I misss u (sic)."" Walters has said that Jaafari was ""looking for a job"" when she contacted her. ""I told her that was a serious conflict of interest and that we would not hire her. I did offer to mention her to contacts at another media organization and in academia."" Walters sent an e-mail to CNN's Piers Morgan and his executive producer, Jonathan Wald, describing her as a ""sensational young woman."" CNN has said Walters contacted ""Piers Morgan Tonight"" on Jaafari's behalf; however, she was neither interviewed nor hired as an intern. Morgan himself denied having had any contact with Jaafari. Walters also e-mailed a professor at Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism on Jaafari's behalf. The professor, former ABC News executive Richard Wald, is the father of Jonathan Wald. Walters later sent a follow-up e-mail to Jonathan Wald, advising him not to bother following up with the college graduate, since she did not have an appropriate U.S. visa. Howard Kurtz, the host of CNN's ""Reliable Sources,"" said the incident makes Walters ""seem a little too cozy"" with someone close to the Syrian regime. ""This looks like a bit of a quid pro quo,"" Kurtz said last week. ""This woman was close to Assad, the daughter of the ambassador, helps her arrange the interview, and the next day they're on e-mail talking about helping her -- Barbara Walters helping her to either get into an Ivy League school or land a media internship.""","""This is an unethical, immoral, baseless, unfounded, animal and brutal approach,"" ambassador says .

"(CNN) -- Football fans traveling to Ukraine for this summer's European Championships have been warned they will face a ""criminal"" police force mired in so many abuse scandals that their behavior threatens to ruin the showpiece tournament. The Amnesty International report ""Ukraine: Euro 2012 jeopardised by criminal police force"" details how Ukraine's security forces have been implicated in numerous cases of torture and extortion in cities due to host matches. According to the report, one recent case in the western city of Lviv -- where Germany, Portugal and Denmark will play -- details how two men were beaten, robbed and then imprisoned by six police officers after a disagreement in a bar. Prosecutors originally refused to open a criminal case until CCTV footage emerged of the incident after one of the men's lawyers gave an interview to a local TV station. ""The Ukrainian government must take action now to stop widespread police criminality,"" said John Dalhuisen, Amnesty International's director for Europe and Central Asia. ""Failure to do so will encourage them to continue acting as a law unto themselves and put Euro 2012 fans in danger from a force that is out of control."" Tens of thousands of fans from across Europe are expected to arrive in Ukraine next month when the tournament -- which is being co-hosted with neighboring Poland -- begins on June 8. Despite huge investment in the country's transport infrastructure, Ukraine has struggled in the run up to the tournament. Stadium delays had initially put the country's hosting of the tournament in jeopardy but now new problems have emerged. Hotel prices during the tournament have risen so sharply due to profiteering that Michel Platini, head of European football's governing body UEFA, was unusually critical when visiting Ukraine last month for the opening of a new airport terminal. ""It's annoying to have made a lot of investment and then say to people that they can't come because there are bandits and crooks who want to make a lot of money during this Euro,"" he told the assembled press in Lviv. Security concerns were raised when multiple bombs exploded in the city of Dnipropetrovsk, close to Donetsk where England will be playing some of their matches. More than 20 people were injured in the blasts. The authorities have so far blamed criminal gangs rather than terrorists for the attack. And the tournament received more bad publicity when several European leaders suggested they might boycott the event in protest at the treatment of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko. Tymoshenko, the face of the Orange Revolution that swept Ukraine in 2004 and 2005, has been in prison since last year on charges that she abused her powers while in office. Her supporters believe the charges are politically motivated. The current Ukrainian president is Viktor Yanukovych who lost power during the Orange Revolution. Tymoshenko would have been a potent foe in next October's parliamentary elections. The government deny that there is any political motivation in her jailing but the former prime minister has alleged that she has been beaten whilst in prison and has gone on hunger strike to secure what she says is urgent medical care. Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Union, Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, and the governments of Austria and Belgium have all said they will not be attending any matches in Ukraine in protest.","Amnesty International label Ukrainian police 'criminal' ahead of Euro 2012 .

"(CNN) -- Police in suburban Dallas are recommending that ex-football star Deion Sanders face a charge that could land him in prison for a year, after a dispute last week that led to his estranged wife's arrest, authorities said Thursday. The fact that the Prosper, Texas, police sought charges against Sanders is not entirely unexpected, as he and a third person had been cited for misdemeanor assault in the incident in question, according to a statement from that town's police released April 25. But the ""Class A Misdemeanor Criminal Mischief"" charge that police are now recommending is more serious than the ""Class C Simple Assault"" charge that Sanders was cited for shortly after the incident. A conviction on a Class A misdemeanor carries a maximum prison sentence of one year and fine of $4,000, according to Texas statutes. A Class C misdemeanor, by comparison, carries a fine of no more than $500 and no prison sentence. The case is now in the hands of the Collin County district attorney's office. As of Thursday afternoon, Sanders -- a 2011 inductee into the Pro Football Hall of Fame and a former Major League Baseball standout who is now an NFL Network analyst -- had not been arrested, Prosper police said in the statement. ""The investigation is continuing, and no other information is available at this time,"" police said. Authorities responded to a domestic disturbance call the afternoon of Monday, April 23, at a Prosper residence where Sanders, 44, complained he was assaulted by Pilar Sanders, 38, and another woman identified as Dianna Boswell, also 38, according to an earlier police statement. Pilar Sanders was detained on a charge of simple assault, a misdemeanor, that statement said. After further investigation, police cited Boswell and Deion Sanders for ""Class C simple assault,"" but neither was taken into custody. Pilar Sanders was released a day later and said she hadn't been given a ""fair shake"" over allegations that she attacked Sanders in an incident he made public in a series of bizarre Twitter postings. ""I understand that I have very little chance at beating a Hall of Fame, two-sport man that everyone seems to love and adore,"" Pilar Sanders said, proclaiming her innocence. The Collin County Sheriff's Office said Pilar Sanders, under an emergency protective order, is forbidden from returning to the couple's home for 61 days and cannot threaten or harass any member of the family. In one of the messages posted last week on his verified Twitter account, Deion Sanders included a photo of what he said were his children filling out complaints to give to police in Texas. ""Pray for me and my kids now! They just witnessed their mother and a friend jump me in my room,"" said the first tweet, posted at 6:15 p.m. ""She's going to jail n I'm pressing charges!"" Two minutes later, Sanders tweeted again. ""I'm sad my boys witnessed this mess but I warned the police department here that she was gone try n harm me and my boys. This is on my mama!"" it said. Pilar Sanders was booked on suspicion of assault family violence, according to booking records at the Collin County Jail. Bail was set at $264. ""I can tell you that there are two sides to every story, and the truth will come out in court,"" Larry Friedman, an attorney for Pilar Sanders, said on the day of her release. The Sanderses have three children together. Deion Sanders has two other children from an earlier relationship. The couple married in 1999 and starred in a reality show, ""Deion & Pilar: Prime Time Love,"" that aired on the Oxygen network. The marriage soured, however, and the two are engaged in bitter divorce proceedings. In February, Pilar Sanders filed a suit against her husband and his aunt, Laura Jones. She said the aunt attacked her in their 10-bedroom, 29,000-square-foot home in Prosper while Deion Sanders watched. At the time, the athlete tweeted that his wife was the aggressor and the aunt was in the home merely to fix his phone. Pilar Sanders also filed a separate suit against her husband and his daughter, Deiondra, after she called her stepmother a ""gold-digging (expletive)"" and ""the number one gold digger of the year"" in Twitter posts. Deion Sanders played for several NFL teams, including the San Francisco 49ers, Dallas Cowboys and Atlanta Falcons. During much of his NFL career, he also was an outfielder with four Major League Baseball teams and played in a World Series with the Atlanta Braves. The NFL Network and Sanders' business manager, Constance Schwartz, have declined to comment about the incident. But a clearly emotional Sanders spoke to Dallas television station KXAS hours after his estranged wife's arrest and appealed for help. ""I got locks on my doors right now,"" he told the station. ""Is somebody going to have to die? Is it going to be me before the court does something and get this woman out of my house? It's absurd.""","Deion Sanders was involved in a dispute with his estranged wife last week .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Axl Rose sent a ""Thanks, but no thanks"" letter to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for its induction of Guns N' Roses in Cleveland next weekend. Bad blood between Rose and several former band mates from the original 1985 lineup is apparently at the center of his decision. The Guns N' Roses lead singer wrote that after being ""polite, courteous and open to an amicable solution,"" he concluded that the induction ceremony ""doesn't appear to be somewhere I'm actually wanted or respected."" ""Of course I realized as things stood, if Guns N' Roses were to be inducted it'd be somewhat of a complicated or awkward situation,"" said Rose, who tours with a version of the group that includes none of the original members from 1985. Rose expressed frustration with what he called ""a seemingly endless amount of revisionism and fantasies"" from former bandmates ""for the sake of self-promotion and business opportunities masking the actual realities."" He singled out original drummer Steven Adler for giving ""interviews filled with reunion lies"" five years ago. ""Until every single one of those generating from or originating with the earlier lineups has been brought out in the light, there isn't room to consider a conversation let alone a reunion,"" he wrote. And don't even try to induct him into the hall without his approval, he wrote. ""I strongly request that I not be inducted in absentia and please know that no one is authorized nor may anyone be permitted to accept any induction for me or speak on my behalf,"" Rose wrote. ""Neither former members, label representatives nor the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame should imply whether directly, indirectly or by omission that I am included in any purported induction of 'Guns N' Roses'."" ""We are sorry Axl will not be able to accept his Induction in person,"" said Lauren Bishop, a spokeswoman for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Slash, the original lead guitarist who left the band in 1996, will attend, his rep told CNN. Duff McKagen, the original bassist, has tweeted his intention to be there.

"New York (CNN) -- The two-story tan house on East Linwood Avenue is unremarkable for suburban Maple Shade, just outside Camden, New Jersey. The man who lived there with his wife and teenage daughter blended in, too. He had friends and family over for barbecues on Memorial Day and other holidays. His neighbors described him as quiet and smiling. But Pedro Hernandez, 51, was apparently living with the knowledge of a terrible act for 33 years. Police believe the confession Hernandez made and signed: that he lured 6-year-old Etan Patz, who vanished near his Manhattan home on May 25, 1979, to a store with the promise of a soda, choked him and placed his body in the trash about a block and a half away. Hernandez was charged Friday, one day after his arrest, with second-degree murder in the boy's killing. And with that and everything else that happened to Hernandez this week, life on quiet East Linwood Avenue became the focus of an entire nation. The Patz case was never officially closed. No one had been criminally charged. The little boy from Prince Street in the Manhattan neighborhood of SoHo gripped the national psyche and launched a novel campaign for missing children that splashed their faces on milk cartons. ""He did the right thing, you know, to confess,"" Hernandez's brother-in-law Jose Lopez told CNN affiliate KYW. ""Get this thing over with for the people out there and the family over here."" Hernandez's neighbors were shocked to learn the news. It took their breath away. Dan Wollick said he knew Hernandez to be quiet and God-fearing. He belonged to a Pentecostal church, according to The New York Times. ""If this guy as they say, confessed to it, for 33 years he's been living in his own personal hell,"" Wollick said. He said Hernandez always made sure to say hello. The family never bothered anyone on the street. ""They were pretty good people, but you never know,"" he said. Chuck Diehn, a retired Philadelphia police officer, told the New York Daily News that the most sinister thing about Hernandez was his incessant smoking. Living next door to him ""was like living next to no one,"" Diehn said. ""All he ever did was sit in that (lawn) chair and smoke cigarettes."" Hernandez was only 19 in 1979. He had been working for a month as a stock clerk at a bodega at 448 W. Broadway that is now an optical store. Hernandez left his New Jersey home voluntarily Wednesday and took detectives back to the scene of his alleged crime, New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said. He described to them what he had done to Etan. In the years that followed, Hernandez told a family member and others that he had ""done a bad thing"" and killed a child in New York. Kelly said an individual tipped police off after the Patz case made headlines again last month, when authorities renewed their search for Etan's remains and excavated a SoHo basement. No ""obvious"" human remains were found. Kelly described Hernandez as remorseful. ""The detectives thought it was a feeling of relief on his part,"" he said. Hernandez has no prior criminal record. He was arraigned Friday, via video feed, from Bellevue Hospital, where he had been taken for medical evaluation and later placed on suicide watch. His defense lawyer, Harvey Fishbein, told the judge during the arraignment that his client has a ""long psychiatric history"" -- including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and hallucinations. Judge Matthew Sciarrino ordered Hernandez be held without bail and granted the defense's request that the suspect undergo a psychiatric evaluation. CNN's Susan Candiotti and Moni Basu contributed to this report.","NEW: Pedro Hernandez is charged with murder in the case of Etan Patz .

"Rio de Janeiro (CNN) -- Carnival revelers descended on Rio de Janeiro, flocking to hundreds of block parties and cramming into designated areas to watch elaborate parades from dusk until dawn. Pounding drums and fireworks explosions announced the start of each samba school that parades down the emblematic strip, flanked by stands with seating for 80,000 spectators. Dancers with platform heels and little else posed for photographers before bursting onto the dazzling pavement. Just before the lavish floats hit the Sambadrome, cranes lowered feathered dancers onto podiums where they will dance and swivel their hips nonstop for 40 minutes. But the five-day Carnival in Rio, which started Friday, is more than just the official parades. Neighborhoods across the city host block parties that attract revelers by the thousands -- sometimes more than a million. They drink and dance behind samba bands that wind their way through the streets. This year, about 850,000 tourists descended on Rio for Carnival celebrations, according to tourism officials.","Pounding drums and fireworks explosions announce the start of each samba school .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- When film documentarian Maria Agui Carter and other Latino producers banded together 13 years ago to address their underrepresentation in mass media, the mission seemed daunting and desperate, Carter said. ""We used to be few hundred people that started in 1999, very frustrated at lack of access, trying to kick down the doors"" of major media and film making outlets, Carter told CNN. ""Through our own community building, we finally realized that we are the ones that we were waiting for."" The National Association of Latino Independent Producers now touts a newsletter of industry trends with 10,000 subscribers, and this week the group will address how the nation's second-largest group watches more television, buys more movie tickets and consumes more media than any other ethnicity -- and yet comprises less than 1% of executives in Hollywood. ""We are celebrating the incredible explosion of Latinos in the media both in front and behind the camera,"" Carter, board chairwoman of NALIP, said Tuesday. ""There are great improvements in the representation of Latinos, especially in television, but there are very few directors, vice presidents and above, film and TV executives and very few at the major and mini-major studios and few in the (talent) agencies and the management companies,"" Carter said. ""That, of course, affects the opportunities that Latinos in the media are able to take advantage of,"" she said. The group's efforts have taken on urgency as the latest U.S. census shows that Hispanics have exceeded the 50 million mark and are officially the country's second-largest population group, surpassing African-Americans. At its annual conference beginning Friday in Universal City, California, the group will honor actress Rita Moreno, who has won an Oscar, an Emmy, a Tony and a Grammy Award, and will feature a keynote speech by director Robert Rodriguez, who will be launching a new cable network called El Rey for Latino and general audiences. NALIP describes itself as the nation's pre-eminent association for Latino independent film and video makers. The NALIP 2012 conference, called ""Diverse Voices, Universal Content,"" is chiefly sponsored by Time Warner (the parent company of CNN) and the National Latino Media Council. ""It's a deeply empowering moment because it's the one time of year when Latinos in the media gather into one community,"" said Carter, who also writes, directs and produces documentaries and feature films through her firm Iguana Films. ""We have generated a really powerful feeling of belonging and an ethos of Latino artists supporting one another,"" she said. The group points out how the presence of minority industry writers in film and television has been stuck at 6% since 1999 and the percentage of minority directors is even smaller. Meanwhile, Latinos are estimated to spend $1 billion on U.S. filmed entertainment and hold $1 trillion in general market buying power, NALIP says. On Saturday, the organization will discuss ""race and the media"" in a closing plenary that will look at how systemic, economic and cultural factors affect representation in mass media. Joseph Torres, a NALIP board member and co-author with New York Daily News columnist Juan Gonzalez of ""News for All the People: The Epic Story of Race and the American Media,"" said among the ways to remedy the inequities is continued training of ""the new generation of film makers."" Advocacy groups also need to hold media companies accountable through federal laws and policy, said Torres, who also is senior director at the national media reform and public interest group Free Press. Government policy ""determines who are the corporate gatekeepers, who owns media outlets under mergers, and whether the Internet will continue to remain a communications network for people to express themselves,"" Torres said. One such example is how the Federal Communications Commission and the U.S. Justice Department last year approved the merger of Comcast and NBC Universal, and now Comcast is starting the Aspire cable network for African-Americans led by Magic Johnson; the Revolt network for pop music by Diddy Combs and MTV veteran Andy Schuon; and Rodriguez's El Rey network, Torres said. The El Rey network would be ""the biggest opportunity, the biggest bellwether trend, for opening mainstream media to Latinos,"" Torres said. ""It's one of the biggest opportunities to come around in a while for Latinos, to have a presence in cable television,"" Torres said. ""It's going to be an opportunity for jobs and producing content.""","National Association of Latino Independent Producers has 10,000 followers of its newsletter .

"(CNN) -- Australia said Monday that it was relaxing sanctions on Myanmar, responding to the Southeast Asian country's political reforms by significantly reducing the number of government officials and lawmakers subject to travel restrictions. The Australian government said it would also encourage trade with Myanmar, which had long languished under oppressive military rule. Australia's previous stance had been to neither encourage nor discourage trade and investment with Myanmar, which is also known as Burma. The announcement by Australia follows moves by a number of Western countries to reward recent efforts by the Myanmar president, Thein Sein, and his government to bring about change in the country, including holding by-elections earlier this month in which opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi's party won dozens of seats. ""Reducing our sanctions and encouraging trade recognize the far-reaching political, economic and social reforms we are witnessing in Burma in recent times,"" the Australian foreign minister, Bob Carr, said in a statement. Carr and the trade minister, Craig Emerson, highlighted the recent release of hundreds of political prisoners, the pursuit of peace deals with ethnic groups and improved laws on freedom of expression, labor rights and political participation. The number of people in Myanmar subject to financial sanctions and travel restrictions by Australia will drop to about 130 from 392, the Australian statement said. Thein Sein ""and other reformists within the government and parliament will be removed from the list, while serving military figures and individuals of human rights concern will remain,"" according to the statement. Australia will also maintain its arms embargo on Myanmar, it said. After separate meetings with Thein Sein and Suu Kyi in Myanmar on Friday, Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain said sanctions on the country should be suspended, rather than lifted entirely, to encourage further progress in democracy and human rights. His suggestion was supported by Suu Kyi, who noted that a suspension would make it clear that sanctions could be reimposed if reforms are obstructed. European Union foreign ministers said in January that they would suspend a visa ban on Thein Sein, as well as on Myanmar's vice presidents, cabinet members and speakers of parliament, calling it ""a first step"" that could be followed by a ""further easing"" of restrictions in the subsequent months. The United States has said it will take several significant steps to normalize relations with Myanmar, including facilitating travel to the United States for select government officials and members of parliament.","Australia highlights the release of political prisoners and peace efforts with ethnic groups .

"Berlin (CNN) -- Germany swore in a new president Sunday, with former pastor Joachim Gauck replacing Christian Wulff, who resigned last month in the face of scandals. Wulff announced his resignation February 17 after he was accused of financial impropriety and doing political favors for associates while he was state premier of Lower Saxony. A day before Wulff resigned, prosecutors in Hanover called for the government to waive his immunity from prosecution, in light of the evidence it had gathered. They cited ""extensive analyses of new documents and the evaluation of further media reports"" as ""grounds for initial suspicion of receiving bribes or being granted advantages."" Wulff has always maintained that he did nothing wrong throughout the course of the scandals -- something he reiterated during his resignation speech. ""I have always behaved legally correctly in the offices I held,"" he said. ""I have made mistakes, but I was always honest."" The German presidency is a largely ceremonial office, but Wulff's resignation was seen as a blow to Chancellor Angela Merkel, who supported his candidacy as president. However, it is unlikely to impact Germany's handling of the eurozone debt crisis, Carsten Brzeski, a senior economist at ING, told CNN. Jose Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission, congratulated Gauck on his election and quoted the German author Goethe, saying: ""Freedom and life are earned by those alone who conquer them each day anew."" Merkel has not had involvement in any of the scandals around Wulff. But Wulff's departure comes within two years of the resignation of his predecessor, Horst Koehler, who was also backed by Merkel -- which raises a question mark over her judgment, Brzeski said. Merkel consulted with the Social Democrats and the Greens on finding a replacement for Wulff. That's a break from her earlier stance in 2010, when she insisted on Wulff as successor to Koehler, who resigned following controversial comments in which he suggested military deployments were vital to Germany's economic success. Gauck becomes the 11th president of the Federal Republic of Germany. CNN's Christopher Cottrell, Laura Smith-Spark and Kendra Wates contributed to this report.","Joachim Gauck replaces Christian Wulff, who resigned last month .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Authorities declined to file criminal charges Wednesday against a fifth-grade student for the death of 10-year-old Joanna Ramos, who suffered fatal blunt force head trauma after a fistfight in February. ""This case was a fight between two children that ended with unintended and tragic results,"" according to a statement by Long Beach Police. Joanna, a fifth-grader at Willard Elementary School, died six hours after an altercation with an unidentified 11-year-old female classmate, said Sgt. Rico Fernandez, a Long Beach Police spokesman. Authorities had ruled her death a homicide. ""Detectives presented all of the facts and evidence of the investigation to The Los Angeles District Attorney's office for review,"" the statement read. ""They determined that they would not file any charges in the case."" Long Beach authorities declined further comment about the case. In February, police said, Joanna and her classmate had challenged each other to a planned fight when their school session ended. ""The two girls met in a nearby alley next to a church and began hitting each other,"" Fernandez said. The fight lasted less than a minute, and no weapons were involved, he said. CNN affiliate KABC reported that friends of Joanna's believed the fight occurred over a boy. According to Long Beach Unified School District spokesman Chris Eftychiou, Joanna finished her regular school session at 2:12 p.m. on February 24 and was supposed to remain on campus to begin her scheduled after-school program at 2:30. ""We believe the altercation occurred during that 15-minute window because she apparently left and returned for the after-school session, which involves help with homework and academic-related activity,"" Eftychiou said. After the fight, the girls went their separate ways, he said. Joanna stayed in the afternoon session for about an hour but did not exhibit obvious signs of physical trauma, Eftychiou said. ""When she did complain of not feeling well, her cousin picked her up, but we had no indication she was involved in an altercation,"" he said. ""Only when she was at the hospital did we get word about the altercation."" Joanna had been enrolled at the school for about a year and a half, Eftychiou said. Los Angeles district attorney spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons confirmed the findings issued by the Long Beach Police Department but declined further comment because the case involved minors. ""The Long Beach Police Department hopes that its conclusion brings some peace to both families involved, as well as the community,"" the statement said.","Joanna Ramos suffered head injury during a fight in February, then died .

"London (CNN) -- Elite athletes around the world are currently hard at work, cramming in a final few months of tough training ahead of the 2012 London Olympics. What drives them all is the hope that the blood, sweat and tears they've invested in their sporting careers over the years will mean that, come August, they are the first to run, swim or bike across that all-important finish line. I am not a natural sportswoman: I am hopelessly unfit and hate pretty much all forms of physical exercise, from the tyranny of team games, to the solitude of slogging around the park plugged into an iPod. But despite this, I beat all those awe-inspiring Olympians to it: I crossed that finish line before them, if only thanks to a quirk of timing, and the luck of the draw. I was one of 5,000 members of the British public whose names were pulled out of the hat to win a place in the National Lottery's Olympic Park Run, a five-mile race around the major Games venues in Stratford, East London. And so despite my status as a running refusenik, I found myself herded, among a crowd of far fitter, healthier, sportier types, into a pen behind the start line, part of a sea of red t-shirted runners beneath a threatening gray sky. Feeling faintly sick, I joined in as we stretched, bent, lunged and jogged on the spot, wondering why it was that I seemed to be the only one worn out by the warmup alone. And then, after some encouraging words from celebrities, and a bit of a singalong, the starting gun was fired and the frontrunners were off, leaving me and the rest of the back-of-the-pack bunch to watch in amazement as they raced away, haring around the course at improbable speeds that brought the fastest and fittest back into the Olympic Stadium and across the finish line before we had even begun. ""The bad news,"" joked the compere, as he waited to wave us off, ""is that you can't win."" However, he assured us, this was bound to be an amazing experience, one we would not forget. At that point I would have been happy to forget the whole thing, and slink off home, but it wasn't to be: A rousing chorus of ""Jerusalem"" from opera singer Sean Ruane, and we too were pouring across the line. Determined to run at least a little of the course, I started as I knew I wouldn't be able to go on for long, jogging until the crowd thinned out and I could take up the brisk walking pace I hoped would get me back to the stadium before the street cleaners moved in to sweep the course. As we looped around the Velodrome at the one-mile mark, to the sounds of a samba band, the sun came out, glinting on the temporary fences, scaffolding and equipment still being used by the neon-jacketed workmen who waved and cheered on the runners -- and walkers. Thankfully, I soon discovered I wasn't the only competitor taking it slow and steady -- there were plenty of us, grinning encouragement at each other as we overtook and then were overtaken, chatting, pausing to take photos of the shiny new Olympic venues we passed along the way, excited to be given a behind-the-scenes glimpse of the park which will be the focus of the sporting world's attention in just a few months. The miles passed surprisingly quickly, and soon I was heading past the View Tube, waving to scores of visitors who had come to see the park-in-progress, and on down into the undercroft of the athletics venue itself, where yet another broad smile spread across my face at the ""Chariots of FIre"" soundtrack being relayed on speakers as we circled beneath the stadium. And then, buoyed up by the music, it was time for my very own snippet of Olympic glory -- entering the echoing bowl of the stadium, to the cheers of spectators. It's the moment every athlete trains their whole life for, and even an anti-sportswoman like me couldn't fail to be thrilled by the sight of thousands of supporters yelling as I jogged, hobbled, and, yes, for the last few hundred yards, RAN towards that finish line, grinning. Later, medal in hand, I watched, awestruck, from the stands as the winners were awarded their trophies and the final two competitors -- one using a walking frame, the other on crutches -- made it across the line to the roars of the crowd. Come August, this place will be all about who makes it across that line fastest. But for one day only, it was simply about making it across the line -- and I am proud to say that I was one of the (last to be) first to do just that. Usain Bolt, I beat you to it.","5,000 runners took part in a five-mile run around the Olympic Park in London .

"Washington (CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama and other world leaders are set to address a host of pressing economic and military security issues this weekend as the United States hosts a high stakes Group of Eight summit outside Washington and a NATO summit in Chicago. A user's guide to the Chicago NATO summit . The three-day diplomatic marathon kicked off Friday morning with remarks by Obama on the rising concern over global food security. Obama outlined a new international effort to address hunger in Africa and elsewhere, calling it a moral, economic and security imperative. The failure to adequately address the issue is ""an affront to who we are,"" he declared. Obama also met at the White House on Friday with new French President Francois Hollande, who was elected on a platform opposing increasingly unpopular eurozone austerity measures. ""Much of our discussion centered on the situation in the eurozone,"" Obama noted. ""President Hollande and I agree that this is an issue of extraordinary importance not only to the people of Europe but also to the world economy."" NATO invites Pakistan to Chicago summit . Leaders of most of the G8 -- made up of the United States, France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, Italy, Canada and Russia -- were meeting later Friday and Saturday at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland. Debate is expected to focus on whether an economically weakened, debt-laden Europe should continue down the road of austerity trumpeted by German Chancellor Angela Merkel or focus more on economic stimulus to help the continent grow its way out of the current crisis. Hanging over the deliberations is the fate of economically battered Greece, which has been unable to form a new elected government. Many analysts believe that Athens will be forced to exit the euro currency shortly, which could further rattle global economic confidence. ""Greece must stay in the eurozone,"" Hollande insisted during his meeting with Obama. We all ""must do what we can to that effect."" The G8 leaders are also expected to discuss the standoff over Iran's nuclear program and the bloody conflict in Syria, where at least 9,000 people have died over the past 14 months, according to United Nations estimates. In recent days, violence has spilled over into Lebanon and Turkey, where thousands of Syrians have fled. Russian President Vladimir Putin will not attend the G8 meeting, which makes significant progress on either Syria or Iran unlikely. Russia has been at odds with the United States and other G8 countries over exactly how hard to crack down on Damascus and Tehran. Later this weekend, the war in Afghanistan is expected to dominate discussions at the NATO summit. Afghan President Hamid Karzai and Pakistani President Asif Zardari are both expected to attend the meeting. Opinion: Why ordinary Afghans worry about NATO summit . NATO leaders are currently on a timetable to withdraw all of the alliance's combat troops from Afghanistan in 2014. One of the key issues to be discussed in Chicago is who will pay to build up Afghan security forces during and after the NATO drawdown. Afghan national security forces should total around 350,000 by 2015, according to CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen. Karzai's government can afford to cover only a fraction of the cost, which is expected to total roughly $4 billion annually after 2014, Bergen notes. NATO's post-Afghanistan future unclear . Another issue is Islamabad's continued blockade of much-needed NATO supplies over Pakistani roads to Afghanistan. Pakistan has kept its airspace open but closed its ground routes after the death of about two dozen Pakistani soldiers in November at the hands of NATO forces at a post on the Afghan-Pakistan border. NATO insists that the incident was an accident. Obama officials are also pushing for more Pakistani involvement in peace talks with the Taliban. Protests are expected near the sites of both the G8 and NATO summits this weekend. ""We expect the worst and hope for the best,"" said Ross Rice, an official with the Chicago FBI. That ""is the way to characterize how the weekend plays out."" CNN's Peter Bergen, Elise Labott and Ted Rowlands contributed to this report.","President Obama is hosting G8 and NATO summits this weekend .

"(CNN) -- Greece may have given us the word democracy and many of the principles of civil society. But now it is ""the sick man of Europe,"" and the people of other European democracies are asking whether it's worth saving with billions more dollars of their money. Put crudely, their argument is this: So what if Greece slides ignominiously out of the eurozone? Goodbye Greece... In continental terms, Greece is peripheral. It doesn't sit on reservoirs of oil, and it relies on agriculture and tourism as money-earners. It accounts for just 5% of the European Union's economic output. With the Cold War long over, its strategic position on the edge of the Balkans is not as important as it was. Second, critics question whether Greece has the will or capacity to stay within the eurozone. In last Sunday's elections, the main Greek parties -- those that had promised to swallow the medicine doled out by the European Union and International Monetary Fund -- were trounced at the polls. Thursday, a third political leader was invited to try to form a government. Greek commentators predict no stable coalition is likely -- and new elections probable, just as a further $15 billion of austerity measures are due. Two weeks ago, the governor of Greece's Central Bank, George Provopoulos, warned that unless the country stayed the course, there could be ""a disorderly regression, taking the country back several decades and eventually driving it out of the euro area and the European Union."" A majority of Greek -- some 70% -- tell pollsters they want the country to remain in the eurozone. But a substantial minority have just voted for parties that oppose what they see as austerity imposed by Berlin. They believe the medicine is actually making the situation worse. This year, the Central Bank forecasts the economy will shrink by 5%, after a 7% contraction last year. That means fewer jobs, less tax revenue and more difficulty meeting debt obligations. Third, is the endless bailout smart economics? Or does it just perpetuate the crisis, as new debt replaces old? A confidential analysis by the IMF, European Central Bank and European Commission in February projected that Greek debt would still amount to 129% of GDP in 2020 and could be as high as 160%. The analysis, obtained by Reuters in February, estimated Greece would need some $175 billion in financing over the next two years. Some argue that so long as Greece uses the euro as its currency, it will never become competitive. Research by investment bank Goldman Sachs concluded Greece needed a real depreciation in its exchange rate of a whopping 30% to restore competitiveness. Compare its situation to that of Iceland, which after a financial meltdown in 2008 thanks to its over-stretched banking sector, went cold turkey with a 40% devaluation of its currency and let bank creditors whistle in the wind. Now it's started growing again, albeit modestly. U.S. economist Kenneth Rogoff has argued that Athens should be granted a sabbatical from the eurozone while remaining in the European Union, allowing it reintroduce the drachma at a deep discount to the euro and making its tourism industry wildly popular. Hans-Werner Sim, head of German think tank Ifo, agrees. The money being showered on Greece to keep it in the eurozone would be better spent lubricating its departure, he says. ""The drachma will immediately depreciate, and the situation will stabilize very quickly. After a short thunderstorm, the sun will shine again,"" he told German magazine der Spiegel. Fourth, beyond the discouraging arithmetic, some argue that the Greek state is too dysfunctional to cope with its massive obligations. Greece has a tax system that barely works, recalcitrant labor unions and extensive graft. The latest corruption league table from Transparency International ranks Greece as 80th - along with El Salvador. ""For decades the political elite, mired in corruption and rent-seeking, has followed the path of wasteful spending and patronage,"" wrote Kostas Bakoyannis, the mayor of Karpenisi, in the Wall Street Journal last month. Greece hasn't privatized a single, state-owned industry despite repeated promises to do so. Its social fabric is fraying and it has a growing problem with political violence. Add to that, now, an unstable political order. And finally, if Greece is unable to get its house in order and uncertainty persists, the dreaded contagion effect will rear its head again. It's a truism that markets hate uncertainty, and for the last year Greece has delivered it in weekly installments. The never-ending melodrama could worsen the psychological climate for other ""olive-belt"" members of the eurozone. Negotiations on restructuring Greek sovereign debt have already left international investors wary of buying other south European debt. According to the Financial Times last month, investors have withdrawn $130 billion from Europe's sovereign bond markets over the past two years. On the other hand... The opposing argument is that a ""disorderly default"" or even a managed exit by Greece would have far-reaching consequences for Europe -- none of them good -- and misreads the Greek mood. Pierpaolo Barbieri, Ernest May Fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School's Belfer Center, has written extensively about Europe's financial crisis. ""Greek voters have turned against the old duopoly of PASOK and New Democracy,"" he says, referring to the dominant parties of the past 30 years. ""They are tired of crisis. That doesn't mean they are against being part of the eurozone. They realize their savings would be wiped out if a devalued drachma took the place of the euro and that Greek banks would collapse. So it's important to separate the weakness of the existing political parties from the issue of the bailouts and the eurozone."" Second, there is no playbook for leaving the single currency, no rules governing expulsion. It was just never envisaged. A new Greek government, by persistently defaulting on debt repayments, might effectively vote itself out of the eurozone, but the process would be messy. Greek companies that take advantage of the single market would be badly affected. ""Any announcement of Greece's departure would wreck havoc in the markets. If Greeks elected someone who wanted to pursue this path, it would be impossible to get back in at a later date,"" Barbieri told CNN. In addition, he says, there is no guarantee that excising Greece from the eurozone will relieve pressure on other members. It might simply refocus anxiety on the next most vulnerable state. ""If Greece were to fall out, what would that say to Portugal, Italy, Spain and Ireland? There would be a danger to the whole European construction, including the single market. The Germans often say ""If the euro fails then Europe fails"" -- and project Europe has been at the core of German foreign policy for half a century."" Italy, Spain and Portugal are in the middle of painful restructuring; just this week the Spanish government announced it would have to step in to rescue the country's third largest bank. The worst-case scenario: that the whole concept of an ""ever-closer union"" toward which Europe has been striving will unwind, one state at a time. ""Europe will have difficulty forming a federation, if its first action is to jettison countries that are unable to make ends meet,"" wrote commentator Barbara Spinelli in the Italian newspaper la Repubblica. Let them eat carrots . Is there a way to muddle through? Maybe. But it will require a tilt from ""austerity"" toward ""growth"" to persuade the Greeks that their suffering will not be endless. The basic choice may remain bailout or bankruptcy, but the bailout can be sweetened, as a spokesman for EU Economics Commissioner Olli Rehn hinted Tuesday. ""We can do lots to assist Greece, and we are doing so. Our member states, our taxpayers in other European member states of the euro area, are providing this solidarity,"" he said. Concrete action must follow, says Barbieri. ""Europe needs to show the Greeks that they have reason to hope by staying the course, that it won't just be pain and more pain. There have to be measures to help growth, such as European investment projects in infrastructure and help for small and medium businesses starved for funding, which can be achieved through the European Investment Bank. The ECB should continue to help Greek banks, so as to start lending again."" Next year, Angela Merkel will be seeking a third term as German chancellor. If she gets one, analysts say, she may have greater freedom to tilt toward growth. ""It would be a positive development if Francois Hollande [the newly elected French President] could hasten this development and create 'rewards' for reforming countries, so as to remind European electorates the monetary union is not a 'suicide pact,' says Barbieri. It may be that even with a rancorous political atmosphere, mass unemployment and street protests, Greece is actually making progress.

"(LifeWire)  -- Charlotte Eulette of Montclair, New Jersey, ceremoniously reclaimed her maiden name and slipped a ring from her mother on her newly bare wedding ring finger. Charlotte Eulette donned a shiny cocktail dress for her divorce celebration to reflect her goal to ""shine on."" Cathryn Michon hit the Los Angeles restaurant Mr. Chow with some friends who'd brought divorce gifts. In Las Vegas, reality-show regular Shanna Moakler served a three-tiered gateau -- complete with knife-wielding-bride cake topper (and matching dead groom) -- to attendees after her (first) split from Travis Barker. If just discussing divorce in public seemed taboo a few years ago, the growing trend of divorce celebrations is helping lessen the stigma surrounding the end of marriage. ""Yes, it's sad and it's painful, but it's not failure,"" says Christine Gallagher, the owner of Los Angeles event company The Divorce Party Planner and the author of a book by the same name. ""It's part of life, and yet it's the only major event for which we have no ritual. ""A celebration communicates that divorce is OK -- life-affirming, even."" Michon, 38, agrees. ""It's like an Irish wake. Just because there's been a death doesn't mean you can't have food and drink, acknowledge the past and hope good things for the future. It's about closure."" Bearing witness, wedding-style . ""At a wedding, you gather friends and family around and say, 'Support us on this journey,'"" says Eulette, 49, whose 2003 post-split bash was attended by the same klatch of far-flung friends and relatives as her wedding. ""A divorce ceremony is a way to gather them around and say, 'I'm moving on. Please support me.'"" And that support, says Michon, is also practical in nature. ""If you split up, someone's getting the blender and someone's not,"" she says. ""My own celebration was a way for my friends to say, 'We love you no matter what, and by the way, here are a few appliances you're missing.' ""Believe me, a toaster means a lot more when your heart's broken than on your wedding day,"" says Michon, a writer, who recently organized a divorce registry at Target for another friend. ""Especially if you're out thousands of dollars in legal fees."" Divorce parties: One size doesn't fit all .

""Burning is big,"" says Gallagher, who's seen everything from wedding dresses to a husband's trophy deer head go up in flames at divorce celebrations organized by her event-planning outfit. The parties -- two or three per month -- serve up signature cocktails with names like the So Long and the Sucker, split-themed soundtracks (""Hit the Road, Jack"" and ""I Will Survive"" are popular) and dartboards adorned with the ex's face. ""A divorce party makes more sense than a bachelor party,"" says Marc Tadros of Montreal V.I.P., whose luxury divorce getaways have drawn customers, about 20 percent of them female, from as far away as Ireland and Germany.

""I wanted to acknowledge the good that came out of the marriage, and let go of the anguish."" In that spirit, Eulette's foundation (and her full-time job) Celebrants USA, which is devoted to celebrating life's milestones, organizes 10 to 15 divorce events each year to help people craft rituals that have meaning for them.

"(EW.com) -- Shortly before the release of 2010â€²s Will Forte-starring action-comedy ""MacGruber,"" the ""Saturday Night Live"" star told this writer that he would definitely like to make a sequel. ""That is a dream scenario,"" said the comic. ""Just to be working with the same group of people would be awesome. I would love the chance to do that again... in a tropical setting."" The chances of anyone ever putting up the dough for ""MacGruber 2"" seemed subatomically slight after the film garnered some dismal reviews -- EW's Liza Schwarzbaum dismissed it as ""90 minutes of talented performers doing and saying dumb, crude stuff in pursuit of an elusive laugh"" -- and a mere $4.1 million on its opening weekend. The good-natured Forte essentially admitted that he and director Jorma Taccone had laid a box-office egg last year when my colleague Grady Smith puckishly asked him, in the course of an ""Awkward Questions"" Q&A, what he had planned for ""MacGruber 3."" The comedian's reply? ""We're definitely gonna make Kristen Wiig's part a little bigger and we're gonna call it 'Bridesmaids 2: MacGruber 3.' And the 'MacGruber 3' will be in very small print."" So it comes as a surprise to learn that Forte and Taccone have been discussing a ""MacGruber"" sequel. Earlier this week the website Screen Crush quoted Taccone as saying that ""Every time I hang out with Will, we talk about all our cool ideas for the sequel. We have the idea for it and we have a title, but I won't tell you what it is."" Truth be told, the idea of a ""MacGruber"" sequel is not quite as bizarre as it might at first appear. If the original film didn't make money, it certainly didn't lose that much thanks to its small $10 million budget. And Forte, Taccone, and co-writer John Solomon's unhingedly risquÃ© creation does have its fans. Devin Fraci of the Alamo Drafthouse blog Bada-- Digest actually made ""MacGruber"" one of his top 10 movies of 2010, hailing Taccone's directorial debut as ""exactly the right combination of raunchy, stupid, anarchic and plain weird."" And just yesterday, chud.com's Tim Kelly wrote that ""No comedy of the last few years is more deserving of a cult following than MacGruber."" True, the film has yet to accrue the kind of cult fanbase which has developed around Tommy Wiseau's so-bad-it's-amazing ""The Room"" -- a movie referenced in ""MacGruber"" -- but that may be because it's not that bad (for the record, this reporter supports any project in which Val Kilmer plays a character called ""Dieter Von Cunth""). The bad news for ""MacGruber"" fans is that Taccone looks likely to next make an adaptation of comic ""The Great Unknown"" (and the bad news for Forte's hopes of filming somewhere tropical is that, according to Taccone, a sequel would follow in the footsteps of ""Die Hard"" by being Christmas-themed).

"(CNN) -- Shareholders of the Olympus Corp. approved a new board Friday despite objections from a vocal minority of shareholders seeking new management that can distance the company from the $1.7 billion cover-up that rocked Japan Inc. The extraordinary shareholders meeting started with the outgoing president, Shuichi Takayama, apologizing to the investors on the cover-up of the losses. He was greeted by boos and hisses. Allegations against the Japanese camera and medical equipment maker came to light after the October dismissal of former President Michael Woodford -- a rare foreign chief executive in corporate Japan -- after he questioned ex-board members about dubious transactions at the center of the case. A special audit of Olympus in December, led by a former Japanese Supreme Court judge, detailed $1.7 billion of hidden losses from failed investments in the 1990s by the company. The report blasted the culture of the company that allowed the losses to be disguised in dubious fees and overvalued payments for companies, as well as the tight control of ex-Chairman Tusyoshi Kikukawa. ""The management was rotten to the core, and infected those around it,"" the panel's report said. Japanese prosecutors arrested seven people tied to the accounting fraud in February, including Kikukawa, ex-Executive Vice President Hisashi Mori and former Auditor Hideo Yamada. Four others arrested were financial advisers who allegedly assisted Olympus executives in the cover-up. The former 11 members of the Olympus board stepped down en masse Friday. The new management includes Yasuyuki Kimoto, a former director of Sumitomo Mitsui Bank, who becomes chairman, while Hiroyuki Sasa, an Olympus executive officer, is promoted to president. Critics -- including Woodford and Institutional Shareholder Services -- opposed the ""insider"" appointments, questioning Kimoto's ties to Sumitomo, the company's biggest lender. Woodford also questioned Sasa's experience to lead Olympus out from under the shadow of the scandal. Olympus released a statement April 11 reaffirming support for the candidates, noting that the majority of new board members are independent outside directors. ""Mr. Sasa's career spans 30 years in the Company's core Medical Business, and in recent years he has been deeply involved in the management of this core business,"" Olympus said in a statement. Olympus is the world's largest maker of endoscopes, and Sasa is currently director of Olympus Medical Services. ""Today would become the touchstone for new Olympus. I would like to ask about the reason of my dismissal,"" Woodford told Japanese media before entering today's meeting. Company officials refused to answer Woodford's question at the meeting, citing ongoing litigation. Woodford is is suing Olympus for wrongful termination. He released a book in Japanese this week on the scandal entitled ""Terminated."" Woodford gave up his public fight to be reinstated as chief executive in January. Meeting with the press yesterday in Tokyo, Woodford said he wanted to shine light on corporate governance in Japan. ""I'm not a magician ... it is 'Alice in Wonderland,'"" Woodford said Thursday at the Tokyo Foreign Correspondent's Club. ""All I can do is draw attention to it."" Olympus shares lost nearly 80% of its market value in the weeks after Woodford went public with his allegations. The stock is now half its value before the scandal broke. Olympus was fined $2.4 million earlier this by Japanese regulators for filing false financial results. The Olympus saga started with a five-page expose in Japanese magazine FACTA -- a small circulation magazine that has only nine people on staff -- on July 20 that raised questions over advisory fees of $687 million paid in 2008 for the purchase of Gyrus, a UK medical instruments firm. The article also questioned the $773 million paid for three small Japanese companies -- a face cream maker, a plastic container maker and a recycling business, each with fewer than 50 employees.

"(CNN) -- The earliest known copy of Leonardo da Vinci's ""Mona Lisa"" -- thought to have been painted at the same time as the original masterpiece -- has been discovered at the Prado Museum in Madrid, Spain. The work offers art-lovers a tantalizing hint of what the model for the world's most famous painting really looked like. Conservators found the portrait hidden beneath layers of black overpainting during restoration work on a picture initially thought to have been a later replica of the ""Mona Lisa."" The restored version shows the same woman that Leonardo depicted, against a landscape similar to that shown in the background of the original, which now hangs in the Louvre in Paris. And while the features of Leonardo's subject have been dulled by centuries of dirt and layers of cracked varnish -- which are unlikely ever to be removed -- in the recently-rediscovered copy, she appears fresher faced and younger than her better-known ""twin."" News of the find was revealed at a symposium at London's National Gallery, linked to its blockbuster ""Leonardo da Vinci: Painter at the Court of Milan"" exhibition, and reported in the Art Newspaper. ""This sensational find will transform our understanding of the world's most famous picture,"" the Art Newspaper reported, adding that the underdrawing found on the Madrid version ""suggests that the original and the copy were begun at the same time and painted next to each other, as the work evolved."" Miguel Falomir, curator of Italian painting at the Prado, told a press conference at the museum expert analysis suggested a strong link between Leonardo and the artist who painted the copy. ""The painting was done in the painter's own workshop,"" he was quoted by AFP as saying. ""It is absolutely consistent with Leonardo's work,"" he said, but he added: ""It is a work in which Leonardo himself did not intervene."" The painting is expected to be unveiled to the public at the Prado Museum later this month. It will then go on display at the Louvre in March, as part of the ""Leonardo's Final Masterpiece"" exhibition, which focuses on his work, ""The Virgin and Child with St. Anne.""","Prado Museum in Madrid, Spain, reveals discovery of earliest known copy of 'Mona Lisa'

"Johannesburg (CNN) -- South Africa's ruling African National Congress said Wednesday the party would drop the lawsuit it filed over a portrait of President Jacob Zuma that shows his genitals. The announcement was made by ANC spokesman Jackson Mthembu at Johannesburg's Goodman Gallery, where the controversial portrait was initially displayed. The work by artist Brett Murray was removed from public show after it was defaced by protesters last week amid a storm of protests and condemnation, the South African Broadcasting Corporation said. Called ""The Spear,"" it is reminiscent of Soviet-era propaganda posters. Red on one half and black on the other, the painting portrays Zuma in a proud stance with his genitals prominently exposed. Zuma's supporters in the ANC say the portrait is insulting and call it an attack on both the president and his party. Mthembu's announcement that the party was dropping its legal action came a day after its supporters took part in a protest march to the gallery. Speaking alongside Goodman Gallery director Liza Essers, Mthembu expressed a wish for unity. A statement on the ANC website Wednesday said: ""The pain and the hurt of the past two weeks caused by the Spear portrait as expressed above is now fully appreciated by the Goodman Gallery and the Artist, Brett Murray. ""Both say, 'it was never the Goodman Gallery's nor Brett Murray's intention to hurt anyone or harm their dignity, the Gallery and Murray regrets the pain that the display of the painting has caused.' "" Lessons should be learned from the furor, the statement said, adding that the gallery, artist and all South Africans should commit themselves to working for ""a South Africa that is united in its diverse cultures"" and respects all individuals' rights. The Sunday newspaper City Press removed an image of the portrait from its website after the ANC threatened a boycott, but it complained Monday that the ANC still wants the paper to apologize for running it in the first place. The Democratic Alliance, the ANC's official opposition, said The Spear ""was brilliant as a work of political satire, which is also why it became an instant icon."" Calls for the painting's censorship, the party said, indicate a dangerous move away from the right to free speech. If he felt insulted, Zuma should have sued the artist rather than calling for the painting's removal, the Democratic Alliance said. CNN's Kim Norgaard contributed to this report.","Brett Murray's painting, called ""The Spear,"" was displayed at a Johannesburg gallery .

"(CNN) -- Anyone who uses a smartphone, puts away money in a 401(k), or wants to keep their grocery bill from skyrocketing needs to be aware of a new dynamic in the world economy. It's called the ""Plan B World"" and it is about how modern shocks to systems in far corners of the world are now having a direct impact on local employment and economies, including the parts that go into cell phones, the financial markets that house our retirement savings and the global agriculture system. We saw the downside of single-source supply contracting and just-in-time inventory systems when a manufacturing plant for a certain type of gasket was destroyed in the 2011 Japanese tsunami. It led to the shutdown of production facilities in the big six automakers in the United States, which weakened the economy and contributed to the U.S. unemployment rate increasing from 8.9% to 9.1% during this time. If carmakers had a Plan B for gasket supply, an economic disruption that put factory employees out of work could have been avoided. Advancements in supply chain technology have improved efficiency and lowered the prices we pay for goods and services. But without a mindset that recognizes that we are in a Plan B world, we are less resilient to the acute shocks and chronic stresses our world faces every day. The Plan B mindset will allow us to use our creativity to proactively plan for more resilient solutions. By that I mean developing ways that people, communities, industries and even nations are better able to rebound in the face of adversity and come back even stronger. What makes this important? The speed of change -- along with the increasing environmental, economic, social and political volatility -- has led to crises of intensifying frequency, scale and severity, with potentially catastrophic effects that cascade across sectors and geographies. A reality of our time is that we cannot anticipate every catastrophe or stressful event.  We can -- and must -- do what we can to prevent bad things from happening, but the fact remains that surprises will still happen.  Ominous recent episodes demand we always have a Plan B that minimizes the lasting effects of a range of future threats and allows us to rebound more quickly and effectively: . • Climate catastrophes, like the deadly floods that paralyzed Thailand in 2011, can trigger disruptions to the world's tenuous manufacturing supply chain. When the autumn flooding in Bangkok closed factories that fed global manufacturers, it forced shutdowns of electronics and automotive assembly lines from Shanghai to Shenzen to Shreveport. • Financial contagion, like the debt crises of Greece and Portugal in 2010 and 2011, can shatter confidence in global financial markets. Losses inflicted by the European crises reversed years' worth of painstaking economic progress for nations and individuals worldwide. • Food shortages, like the drought-induced famine emergency in Somalia and Ethiopia in 2011, can cause food riots locally and speculative panics globally. Such market gyrations can contribute to protectionist measures that drive worldwide food-price spikes and further punish the most vulnerable. • True natural disasters, like last year's Japanese earthquake and tsunami, can expose dangers in nationwide planning systems and calamities in power and other sectors. The sudden discovery of structural weakness in many of Japan's nuclear power plants forced the shutdown of its nuclear electricity network, with the power outage provoking an economic stall. • Disease pandemics, like the SARS outbreak that swept through Asia in 2002 and 2003, can spread infections across borders as fast as 747s can ferry passengers across oceans. • Cyberattacks and hacking can undermine public faith in the secure data that supports global commerce. Further, the infiltration of infrastructure networks and military systems can compromise national security. A Plan B would not just build higher levees and a more regulated banking system.  It would look at ways of setting up redundant systems so that when one system fails another takes up some of the slack.  Or when we design our flood or economic plans, can we keep in mind ways to prevent cascading failures when one part of the system collapses? There are already some Plan Bs being put in place.  Two examples come from work that the Rockefeller Foundation is supporting today. • In Ethiopia, some of the poorest subsistence farmers in the country are receiving crop insurance through an innovative program spearheaded by Oxfam America that allows farmers to trade work for insurance. This makes farmers more resilient against drought, famine and floods. • The Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network is a 10-city initiative to develop climate resilience strategies appropriate to each city.  One of the cities where the program is operating is Danang, Vietnam.  Their strategy included hydrology mapping, which led the city to halt building plans in vulnerable areas and has shaped the city's future development plans.  This planning will reduce the vulnerability of people and property to the effects of climate changes. This is only a start.  How we strengthen Plan Bs and interconnect them is the focus of a meeting this week in Washington that is bringing together global leaders and thinkers across an array of fields.  From these discussions, a clearer way forward will be developed, that will be followed by grants aimed at achieving this goal. This is just one step toward a more resilient world. It is long past time for everyone to work together to reinforce society's complex systems at their most vulnerable points. We are on our way. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Judith Rodin.","Judith Rodin: In a globalized world, local disasters can have consequences everywhere .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court is set to release its much-anticipated rulings on the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act, the comprehensive health care law enacted two years ago. The election-year rulings will not only guide how every American receives medical care but will also establish precedent-setting boundaries for how government regulation can affect a range of social areas. Your health and your finances could be on the line. The outcome's possibilities are myriad: a narrow or sweeping decision? A road map to congressional authority in coming decades? Which bloc of justices, which legal argument will win the day? Here are five scenarios -- strategic markers of a sort -- to watch as the high court weighs in on health care. Congress ready for health care decisions -- then it gets tricky . Wait another day? The first question the high court tackled in its seven-hour marathon argument in March was something few observers had expected: It boiled down to whether the law's individual mandate is a ""tax"" that could prevent the court from considering the broader constitutional questions. A little-known federal law -- the Anti-Injunction Act, dating back to 1867-- bars claimants from asking for a refund on a tax until it has been paid. This ""gateway"" issue could render moot all the other pending health care questions if the justices think the minimum coverage requirement amounts to a tax. Most justices seemed reluctant to take that route at the public argument session; they appeared eager to move on and address the broader, more vital constitutional questions. But citing the Anti-Injunction Act might give cautious justices a way out of deciding the explosive issue in an election year. The majority might conclude that the political branches can best resolve the conflicts, at least for now, or that the matter can be handled after the November elections. Some court watchers have called this the health care ""sleeper issue"" that could delay a decision on the constitutionality of the individual mandate for at least four years. Health reform: What's at stake for small business . 'Weak argument' = certain loss? Baseball statisticians have nothing on the legal bar. After the arguments, wonky lawyers began counting the number of questions -- some hostile, some polite -- that the nine justices had tossed at opposing counsel. The somewhat squishy idea: the more questions a lawyer gets, the tougher it will be to prevail. During the two hours of debate over the most closely watched aspect -- the individual mandate -- Solicitor General Donald Verrilli fielded more than 100 questions from the bench. His opponents -- private attorneys Paul Clement and Michael Carvin-- together faced only about 87. Verrilli, as the federal government's key lawyer before the high court, was defending the law from a coalition of 26 states seeking its nullification. Verrilli, in the view of many court-watchers, had a bad day, struggling at times to find his voice and fend off a furious rhetorical assault by some skeptical members of the bench. Chief Justice John Roberts was especially tough -- he interrupted Verrilli 23 times, but only on seven occasions on the other side. As a former government and private advocate before joining the bench, the 57-year-old chief personally argued 39 cases at the high court and was widely regarded as among the best at making his case. In 2004, while a federal appeals court judge, Roberts wrote a law review article explaining why query counts matter. ""The secret to successful advocacy is simply to get the [Supreme] Court to ask your opponent more questions,"" he wrote. Basics: Health care reform issues . Divide and conquer -- 5-4 decisions . But a perceived ""weak"" argument or a voluminous volley of questions does not necessarily spell doom for the Obama administration. Getting nine intellectual hotshots with big egos to line up all the time along ""expected"" conservative-liberal lines is largely a myth. Only eight of the 55 full opinions released by the court this term have been decided by a one-vote margin. Of course, the most contentious cases are normally the last to be finished, and the number of 5-4 rulings is likely to rise with the 15 or so petitions remaining on the docket. But closely ""divided"" decisions are not the norm overall. Some legal and political scholars hold out hope the court will offer a united 9-0 voice behind the law's mandate, whatever the outcome, hoping such a decision would instill political and public confidence. They point to the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education case, in which the justices -- despite internal disagreements -- came together to unanimously strike down racial segregation in public facilities. But this is a different court and health care in many ways is unique in the court's jurisprudence -- the scale, scope, and political underpinnings all make it especially complex and contentious. The real people behind health care reform . To ""swing"" again . A recent ""Time"" magazine cover featured an intense, distinguished-looking older man, wearing glasses and the slightest of smiles. Most Americans would not recognize him if he walked down the grocery store aisle. But, as with most hot-button Supreme Court cases, Justice Anthony Kennedy -- the moderate-conservative often referred to as the ""swing"" justice -- could decide whether the individual mandate stands. So many are watching the native of Sacramento, California, who turns 76 next month, as well as another fellow conservative. ""With the four more liberal justices almost certain to vote to uphold the individual mandate, the administration is really hoping for the votes of either the chief justice, who signaled that he had questions for both sides, or the traditional swing vote in the court, Anthony Kennedy, who really was tough on the government lawyer but toward the end suggested that maybe insurance was special enough that he could vote to uphold the mandate,"" said Thomas Goldstein, SCOTUSblog.com publisher. Even the perception that his vote might be in play builds Kennedy's power from within, and makes him one to watch. For cancer patients, health act a lifeline . R-E-S-P-E-C-T . Will the Supreme Court think big when issuing its decision -- sweeping pronouncements on the scope of federal vs. state power when it comes to the Commerce Clause? Or will a narrow approach be the way the justices reach consensus, some sort of workable solution that would give Congress clear guidance going forward -- the discretion to perhaps reshape health care in a way that meets constitutional scrutiny. The key may be how the court's shaky conservative majority defines a long-standing bedrock principle: judicial deference. Some states have long complained that their autonomy is being eroded by creeping federal intervention on spending matters. Article 1 of the Constitution gives Congress the power to ""lay and collect ... taxes to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States"" and to ""regulate commerce ... among the several states."" Such authority has long been broadly interpreted, including when imposing conditions on recipients, be they individuals or states. Every student of government knows the Supreme Court has the power to declare acts of Congress unconstitutional. The precedent-setting 1803 Marbury v. Madison decision remains a cornerstone of federal court authority, codifying the idea of separation of powers as an enduring hallmark of the American system of government. A health care 'Judas' recounts his conversion . That power has been used wisely -- judiciously, if you will -- over the years. The courts by their nature are reluctant to frustrate the will of the political branches, which are accountable directly to the people. It is a message President Obama himself offered just days after oral arguments in the health care cases were completed. ""The point I was making is that the Supreme Court is the final say on our Constitution and our laws, and all of us have to respect it, but it's precisely because of that extraordinary power that the court has traditionally exercised significant restraint and deference to our duly elected legislature, our Congress,"" said the former law school professor. ""And so the burden is on those who would overturn a law like this."" Some conservatives interpreted those and remarks the day before as political interference in an independent branch of government. ""The president crossed a dangerous line this week, and anyone who cares about liberty needs to call him out on it,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said. ""The independence of the court must be defended. Regardless of how the justices decide this case, they're answerable, above all, to the Constitution they swore to uphold. The fact that this president does not appear to feel similarly constrained to respect their independence doesn't change that one bit. So respectfully, I would suggest the president back off."" The justices themselves are not prepared to back off when they issue their decision. Nor are they likely as individuals to back into the political firestorm sure to follow. Their ruling will speak for itself -- however big, small, or confusing it may be. After that, the justices will again retreat largely from public view, to begin a three-month recess.

"(CNN) -- Facebook advocates are touting the company's initial public offering this week -- the biggest ever for an Internet company-- as if it will save the net, the economy and the American way. Its detractors see the final chapter in the rise and fall of a smart but solipsistic Harvard dropout, and predict the inevitable decline of Facebook's stock will spell the end to innovation in social media. Internet Bubble 2.0. Of course, none of this is true. Such hyperbole is more about our traditional media's need for simple stories than anything happening at Facebook or on Wall Street. These are the judgments of financial analysts who don't even know what API stands for (application program interface), and technology analysts who never heard of the Greenshoe option (the provision for an underwriter to oversell). This factless speculation, combined with the risk-off jitters of the greater markets, has led to the conflation of stock value with business, and one social media company with the future of the net. If the dot.com bubble and more recent stock market crash should have taught us anything, it's that stock prices have been uncoupled from business profitability, which has in turn been uncoupled from value creation. Facebook can still be one of the most successful and significant companies of the past 100 years without being nearly worth an IPO valuation of $100 billion. Meanwhile, traders buying stock at that valuation can still make billions more over the next hours or days, even if the stock then plummets or slowly peters out. Likewise, Facebook can shoot to a sustained stock market success even without showing a reasonable profit for many years. Finally, Facebook can become the biggest stock market and business loser since Lucent (who?) without taking the Internet or social media down with it. So to start, let's look at the IPO in isolation. Is Facebook worth the $96 billion reportedly implied by IPO valuation? Not at the moment. Facebook's profits are down since last year, its membership growth is stagnating and the online advertising market is softening. This IPO comes at a later than ideal time, as the potential trajectory for the company no longer seems infinite. Does that mean you shouldn't buy the stock on opening day? Of course not. The price of Facebook shares will have nothing to do with the reality on the ground (or online). Everyone wants in, demand is outstripping supply, and the hunger for shares could push the price very high in the short term. None of this has anything to do with social media, it's just gambling. It's also possible that even the craziest speculators are still undervaluing Facebook's ultimate worth. That's where a media theorist like me can venture an opinion -- and I'd have to say no, they're not. Facebook is certainly the best of the social media apps to come along, just as Google was the best search engine. Similarly, however, the social media playpen constituted by Facebook is temporary. Just as we are moving away from Web search into a world of applications running on smartphones, we will move away from our single Web-based social media platform toward more ad-hoc social apps on our handheld devices. It's hard for us to imagine right now, but we won't be logging into Facebook to find out what's going on; we'll work and play in an ecology of apps that tell us where people are and what they are doing. Yes, Facebook may have a role in that next-generation social media universe, but it will need what tech industry people like to call ""a second act."" Apple's second act is the iPhone. Google is hoping for ""augmented reality"" eyeglasses and network-controlled automobiles. Are you living without Facebook? Facebook's second act is far from clear. It wants to become the platform on which everybody else builds social media apps. But if all this activity is happening on smartphones, then Facebook is dangerously dependent on Android and iPhone for everything, a layer on top of Apple and Google's systems. Facebook's inability to generate income on the smartphone has led to some desperate moves, such as its billion-dollar acquisition of photo-sharing app Instagram and off-putting products like ""sponsored stories."" So far, love him or hate him, Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg has been consistent with his vision of building a more social Web: a peer-to-peer communications infrastructure that changes the way people connect, share ideas and sell things. The more comingled his mission becomes with the priorities of Wall Street, the less freedom he will have to challenge the status quo. The Facebook IPO itself, for instance, is being conducted in the most traditional fashion possible, with underwriters establishing a price and offering shares through brokerage houses. Compare this to Google, who let the public establish the share price through open bidding, mirroring the company's revolutionary, bottom-up search algorithm, and challenging underwriters with net democracy. The most radical thing Zuckerberg has done so far is attend investor meetings in a hoodie -- as if to say, ""in your face."" Cute, but it hardly asserts innovation in the face of profiteering, or social networking in the face of the corporate capitalism. This is a week when the stock markets are particularly vulnerable to a new message. The CEO of Yahoo is resigning after a controversy over resume padding, while executives at JP Morgan Chase are falling on their swords for losing so much money, so quickly, that they may change the regulatory landscape for their entire industry. People are ready to embrace a new way of playing this tired game. By jumping headfirst into the stock market, Facebook may be joining a zero-sum shell game at just the wrong ""risk off"" moment. If Facebook does succeed in the stock market this week, then it will do so at the expense of Groupon, Apple and Google, whose net-fetishizing investors will likely be selling those shares in order to buy the new ones from Facebook. Worse, by joining in the speculative economy on Wall Street's terms, a company that might have changed business instead subjects itself to forces far beyond its control. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Douglas Rushkoff .","Douglas Rushkoff: Speculation over the meaning, value of Facebook IPO is overblown .

"(CNN) -- The English Premier League has decided to dispense with the traditional pre-match handshakes before Sunday's clash between Chelsea and Queens Park Rangers due to the legal case involving John Terry and Anton Ferdinand. Chelsea captain Terry is accused of racially abusing QPR defender Ferdinand during a match between the two teams at Loftus Road back in October. At a preliminary hearing in February, Terry's lawyer entered a not guilty plea and the judge decided to adjourn the case until July 9 -- after the Euro 2012 finals. After the case was put back, Terry was stripped of the England captaincy, triggering the turn of events that eventually led to Fabio Capello's resignation as coach. But ahead of the two players coming face-to-face at Chelsea's Stamford Bridge stadium, the Premier League has decided to abandon their usual pre-match ritual, given the legal complexities involved. A statement on their official website read: ""The Premier League position on the pre-match handshake convention remains consistent. In all normal circumstances it must be observed. ""However, after discussions with both Chelsea and Queens Park Rangers about the potential and specific legal context in relation to John Terry and Anton Ferdinand the decision has been taken to suspend the handshake convention for Sunday's match."" When the teams met in the English FA Cup in January, the Football Association dispensed with the pre-match handshake to ""diffuse further tensions."" The handshake ritual caused huge controversy earlier in the Premier League season when Liverpool's Uruguayan striker Luis Suarez refused to shake the hand of Manchester United's French defender Patrice Evra. This was after Suarez had been banned for eight games by the Football Association after being found guilty of racially abusing Evra in an earlier match. Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson called Suarez a ""disgrace"" after the game. The striker later apologized, as did his club. Terry has remained Chelsea captain and was part of the side that made it into the European Champions League final at the expense of Barcelona on Tuesday, though he was sent off for an off the ball incident and will miss the final against Bayern Munich on May 19.","The Premier League dispense with pre-match handshakes for Chelsea v QPR match .

"Denver (CNN) -- A Colorado advocacy group is spending thousands of dollars to convince people that smoking pot is safer than drinking alcohol. It's an attempt by the Campaign to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol to rally support for a vote in November that would legalize the drug for recreational use. Colorado legalized marijuana for medical use in 2000. Last Friday, the group aired an advertisement on a local Denver channel during daytime programming encouraging people to ""start your conversation about marijuana."" The 30-second spot features a young woman typing a message to her mother on her laptop, explaining that after spending her college years drinking heavily, she now prefers marijuana because ""it's less harmful ... I don't get hung-over and honestly I feel safer around marijuana users."" The marketing campaign aims to ""break down the stereotype about who the typical marijuana user is,"" explained the campaign's co-director, Mason Tvert. ""Most of them are professional, hard-working people,"" he said. The TV ad, which aired only on Friday, cost about $2,000, according to Tvert. It may run again, depending on fund-raising efforts, he said. Last month, the campaign spent about $4,500 on a billboard near Denver's (Sports Authority Field at) Mile High stadium -- purposely adjacent to the Mile High Liquors store -- to deliver a similar message, Tvert said. The billboard also features a woman, this one in her 50s, standing with her arms crossed next to the message: ""For many reasons, I prefer ... marijuana over alcohol. Does that make me a bad person?"" Watch the TV ad . By attempting to change ""stereotypes"" about marijuana users, the campaign hopes to make Colorado the first state to legalize recreational marijuana use. ""The goal is the choice -- to make sure adults have the choice to use a less harmful substance than alcohol,"" Tvert said. Dr. Otis Brawley with the American Cancer Society questioned that conclusion. ""The problems of excessive alcohol use and the problems caused by any even minor smoking of marijuana are so different, I have difficulty comparing,"" said Brawley, CNNhealth.com contributor and the American Cancer Society's chief medical and scientific officer. ""There are short-term and long-term primarily pulmonary problems associated with marijuana (and) excessive alcohol use is long-term correlated with GI (gastrointestinal) and neurologic problems."" Study: Occasional pot smoking not as damaging as cigarettes . Also debatable is whether the money generated by legalizing and regulating marijuana through taxes will outweigh the costs of creating government-run marijuana distribution centers. Tvert says the Campaign to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol estimates that legalizing and regulating marijuana could generate $50 million a year in saved expenses and revenue. ""We've been pushing very hard in Colorado and people agree, it's not worth the law enforcement resources being used (to crack down on marijuana users) and it's not worth losing out on the tax dollars,"" he said. 22 million Americans use illegal drugs, study says . Tvert said he was not aware of any criticism for the advertisement, noting that legalizing marijuana is ""one of the biggest issues in our state legislature in the last few years."" ""We live in a state that has made a lot of progress on the issue,"" he said. ""It's not as controversial as many other issues."" That's partly because of the prevalence of medical marijuana dispensaries across the state. State-sanctioned marijuana dispensaries now outnumber Starbucks in Colorado and there are well over 100,000 people on the medical marijuana registry. Mobile marijuana clinic for Colorado's rural residents . Six years ago, an attempt to legalize marijuana in Colorado failed. This year's initiative goes much further than the 2006 ballot, because it establishes a system that regulates and taxes the drug, Tvert said. He believes the infrastructure created by Colorado's medical marijuana industry will help boost the chances that voters will approve legal recreational use of the drug. Residents are also more accustomed to the idea of a legalized form of the drug, now that medical marijuana dispensaries are a common sight across the state, Tvert said. ""We're not asking people to imagine, as we would just two years ago,"" he explained. ""People have seen that just because there's a marijuana center in Colorado ... just because there might be a storefront in your town or city, it hasn't caused any problems."" He noted that the initiative would allow cities and municipalities to ""opt out"" of allowing marijuana sales, similar to ""dry counties"" which ban the sale of alcohol. Colorado isn't the only state where voters will consider legalizing marijuana in the fall: there's a similar ballot initiative in Washington and there could be one in Oregon, as well, if enough signatures are collected. ""There are actually... close to 17 or 18 initiatives working their way to the ballots,"" according to Sue Rusche, president and CEO of the non-profit anti-drug organization, National Families in Action. Rusche said her group's main focus is to ""force the (marijuana) industry"" to ensure that it doesn't market the drug to children. ""We ask a question: if a state actually does legalize marijuana for recreational use... what kind of things can we learn form the alcohol and tobacco industries in the way they've marketed to kids?"" she said. ""What can we do to prevent that (marijuana) industry from marketing to kids?"" She said setting a legal age limit of 21 is not enough. ""We do not trust the advocates who are trying to legalize marijuana because we don't believe they are willing to look at these other two industries (alcohol and tobacco),"" Rusche said. ""Everything we read in their initiative has to do with making money and not protecting kids."" If any marijuana initiative passes, Rusche said her group is interested in working with the state agencies that write the regulations in order ""to force the industry to self-police rather than (have) the taxpayers pay for the cost"" of any negative consequences, including addiction treatment and accidents caused by driving under the influence. ""We want people to take marijuana legalization seriously and think seriously about the consequences to kids,"" she said. When asked about Rusche's concerns, Tvert said he was confident the marijuana industry would not target its product to minors. ""There's a great deal of self-regulating already taking place -- business owners not choosing marijuana leaves or cartoon characters,"" he said, referring to the medical marijuana industry. ""It's an evolving industry (and) in theory, these are standards that are already being created."" That doesn't mean the marijuana industry won't advertise its product in places where children might be present, though. ""It's worth noting, every young person that walks into a professional baseball game in Colorado (at Coors Field) is walking into a beer commercial,"" he said. ""So the notion that we somehow cannot possibly have marijuana legal because young people will somehow know about it and see it, is unrealistic."" CNN's Tricia Escobedo reported on this story from Atlanta and CNN's Jim Spellman reported from Denver.","Voters to decide in fall whether Colorado will be the first state to allow recreational marijuana use .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Egypt's first democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsi, will appoint a woman as one of his vice presidents and a Christian as another, his policy adviser told CNN. ""For the first time in Egyptian history -- not just modern but in all Egyptian history -- a woman will take that position,"" Ahmed Deif told CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Monday. ""And it's not just a vice president who will represent a certain agenda and sect, but a vice president who is powerful and empowered and will be taking care of critical advising within the presidential Cabinet."" Amanpour blog: The woman who monitored Egypt's election . The news came as the man Morsi beat for the presidency, Ahmed Shafik, left Egypt for Abu Dhabi, and as Cairo's administrative court overturned a rule that allowed the military to arrest people without a warrant. Though Morsi had previously argued for banning women from the presidency, he said before the election that as president he would stand for women's rights. ""The role of women in Egyptian society is clear,"" Morsi told CNN weeks before the runoff election. ""Women's rights are equal to men. Women have complete rights, just like men. There shouldn't be any kind of distinction between Egyptians except that ... based on the constitution and the law."" The Islamist figure, a Muslim Brotherhood leader, also promised to safeguard the rights of minorities. Egypt ""definitely"" will not be an ""Islamic Republic,"" Deif said Monday. Morsi moved into his offices Monday, said Jihad Haddad, an adviser to the transition team. He began the work of assembling a new government -- one of the powers he maintains after the military junta running the country recently slashed the presidency's reach. The process of picking people to serve in the Cabinet ""won't end in a day,"" Haddad said. Shafik, who lost in the runoff election to Morsi, left the country Tuesday for the United Arab Emirates, his attorney and a Cairo airport official said. He traveled to Abu Dhabi, Cairo airport official Mohamed Sultan said. He is not fleeing the country, Shafik's attorney, Showee Elsayed, told CNN. While legal petitions accusing Shafik of corruption were submitted in April, prosecutors have not taken legal action on them, so ""there are absolutely no legal cases pending"" against him, Elsayed said. Shafik was the final prime minister to serve under President Hosni Mubarak before he was ousted. Shafik's office said Tuesday he ""will establish a new political party upon his return from the UAE and Saudi Arabia, where he is on private visits."" He and his two daughters will perform Umrah, an Islamic religious pilgrimage to Mecca. Meanwhile, Cairo's administrative court, which hears civilian complaints against the government, rejected a controversial rule Tuesday that the Ministry of Justice had established before the election. The rule stated that military personnel and intelligence forces could arrest civilians without a warrant. The right to arrest civilians had previously been reserved for police officers, the state-run Ahram news agency reported. The court also decided that, on September 1, it will look into legal petitions filed against the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces over its decision to cancel the constitutional committee, which had been charged by the parliament before it was dissolved with drafting a new constitution. The court decided that on July 7, it will look into legal petitions filed to stop recently issued constitutional articles by SCAF that limit the powers of the president. And on July 10, the court will look into legal petitions filed against the decision to dissolve parliament. They were among 14 legal complaints filed about the rule by various individuals and groups, including the Muslim Brotherhood. CNN's Samuel Burke, Amir Ahmed and Josh Levs contributed to this report.","A Cairo court overturns a rule allowing the military to arrest civilians .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama made light of the serious -- a Secret Service scandal and lavish spending at a government conference -- and the inconsequential -- the graying of his hair -- at the annual White House Correspondents' Association Dinner on Saturday night. And he even made time for business tycoon Donald Trump, whom Obama kidded at last year's dinner about pushing the president to release his long-form birth certificate. ""We gather during a historic anniversary. This weekend last year, we finally delivered justice to one of the world's most notorious individuals,"" Obama said to a packed ballroom at the Washington Hilton. A photo of Trump was shown, rather than that of slain al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. Obama then went back even further in time. ""Four years ago, I was in a brutal primary battle with Hillary Clinton,"" Obama said. ""Four years later, she won't stop drunk texting me from Cartagena,"" a reference to the city where Secret Service agents allegedly consorted with prostitutes. He then pointed out photos of his hair four years ago, and in 2012, showing it had grayed considerably. ""Four years from now I will look like this,"" he said to laughs as a photo of actor Morgan Freeman was shown to the audience of more than 2,500. Journalists and news organizations were well-represented at the affair and they brought famous faces in tow. Among those who dazzled on the red carpet Saturday were Claire Danes, Elizabeth Banks, Paul Rudd, Sigourney Weaver, Eva Longoria, Viola Davis, Kerry Washington, Rachel Zoe, Goldie Hawn and Josh Hutcherson. The annual gala, also known as the ""Nerd Prom,"" raises money for journalism scholarships. The president, speaking before comedian Jimmy Kimmel, made light of a General Services Adminstration conference in Las Vegas that cost more than $800,000. ""Look at this party. We have men in tuxes, women in gowns, fine wine, first-class entertainment. I was relieved to hear it was not a GSA conference,"" Obama quipped. He even chided Kimmel, star of ABC's ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" ""Jimmy got his start on the 'Man Show.' In Washington, that is what we call a congressional hearing on contraception."" Kimmel, who took the stage following the president's monologue, hit back. ""Remember when the country rallied around you in the hopes of a better tomorrow?"" Kimmel asked. ""That was hilarious."" Kimmel said there was a term for ""guys like the president,"" and it wasn't two terms. Nobody in the room was safe from Kimmel's barbs, which he fired at politicians, journalists, celebrities and corporate executives in attendance. Kimmel praised Michelle Obama's work to combat obesity with her health initiative. The comedian then pointed out rotund New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie to the first lady. ""Look, it's Chris Christie. Get him,"" Kimmel said. Kimmel then took aim at Newt Gingrich's weight. But Kimmel's fat jokes fell, well, flat with the former House speaker. The dinner was Obama's fourth as president. It has been a ritual in Washington since 1920, when it was first held to boost communication between the press and the president, according to the association's website. It was open only to men until 1962, when President John F. Kennedy said he would not attend unless women were invited. Speaking of women, first ladies have been known to get in their own digs. In 2005, Laura Bush said friends went out one night to see male strippers after Bush, ""Mr. Excitement,"" was typically fast asleep at 9 p.m. First lady Hillary Clinton was featured in a video clip shown at the 2000 dinner. Seated in a limousine, she told the camera, ""I wish I could be here more, but I really think Bill has everything under control."" The president ran out to the White House driveway, yelling after the departing car, shouting, ""Wait! Wait! You forgot your lunch!"" While the dinner is notorious for its bawdy humor, the president took a moment to remember the sacrifices of journalists Anthony Shadid and Marie Colvin, who both died while covering the conflict in Syria.","Jimmy Kimmel gives as good as he gets .

"(CNN) -- After ruining Memorial Day plans along the Florida and Georgia coasts, the remnants of Tropical Storm Beryl are forecast to bring more rain to the Carolinas. The National Hurricane Center said Monday evening it expects the storm to move over the southern portions of Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina over the next 48 hours. As of 5 p.m. Monday, Beryl, downgraded to a tropical depression, was centered about 10 miles east of Valdosta, Georgia, and about 150 miles southwest of Savannah. Beryl's maximum sustained winds Monday evening were near 30 mph, down 5 mph from Monday morning, and the hurricane center said there will be little change in strength over the coming days. It was still producing lots of rain and creating dangerous surf conditions, including rip currents, along the coast from northeastern Florida to North Carolina, the hurricane center said. Beryl made landfall just after midnight Sunday near Jacksonville Beach, Florida. It brought more than 5 inches or rain to Palm Coast, Florida, just south of Jacksonville, according to the local National Weather Service Forecast Office. There were media reports of 6 inches in the Jacksonville neighborhood of Arlington and reports of more than 4 inches in a neighborhood farther south, the forecast office said. Other areas reported more than three inches of rain. Beryl also produced a small tornado Monday afternoon near Port St. Lucie, Florida, the forecast office said. The twister caused roof damage and downed some trees and power lines. Couple ties the knot as Beryl comes ashore . The storm caused Jacksonville Mayor Alvin Brown to cancel all Memorial Day ceremonies. A Memorial Day event at the Veterans Cemetery in nearby St. Augustine also was canceled, CNN affiliate WTLV reported. The Jacksonville Transportation Authority suspended all bus routes to area beaches. Twelve flights scheduled to leave Jacksonville were canceled Monday, according to the Jacksonville Aviation Authority. The storm's powerful winds also knocked out power across the region and roads and bridges to close. Beryl cut short weekend plans for hundreds of campers and day-trippers to Georgia's Cumberland Island National Seashore as they were ordered to leave ahead of the storm, the National Park Service said. Beryl was the second named storm of the year, preceding the June 1 official start of the Atlantic hurricane season. It never became a hurricane, peaking only as a tropical storm over the weekend. A storm surge and high tide could cause coastal flooding of up to 2 feet along the coasts of Georgia and Florida, according to the hurricane center. Beryl is expected to dump 4 to 8 inches of rain along parts of the Southeastern coast, with isolated maximum amounts of 12 inches. Though it wrecked holiday plans, Beryl is bringing much needed rain to the area, most of which is experiencing an ""extreme"" or ""exceptional"" drought, according to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, which tracks drought conditions nationwide. CNN's Sarah Dillingham, Devon Sayers, Chandler Friedman, Ed Payne, Jessica Jordan and Ric Ward contributed to this report.","NEW: Up to 6 inches of rain was reported near Jacksonville, Florida .
